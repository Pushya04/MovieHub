A Fine comedy treat,"Carrey is on top mad-cap form in the Mask, he plays Stanley Ipkiss, a boring Mr. nice guy with a longing for more excitement and success in his life. When he finds a relic of an ancient mask, he gets slightly more than he could have dreamt of; he becomes a cartoonish superhero and at last he can live out his desires; or not!This film also introduced the very beautiful Cameron Diaz, and what man can forget her first screen appearance as she breezes in to the bank in all her splendour.Hilariously funny, cracking special effects and a thoroughly entertaining story, the Mask is a winner people, and it's an absolute must-see for everyone who likes a bit of Jim Carrey madness.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
one of Carrey's best,"Broad, inventive comedy stars Carrey as a repressed, down-on-his-luck banker whose once uneventful life is dramatically changed when he uncovers a mysterious ancient mask that brings out his innermost desires. After developing a close bond and gradual affection for a sexy songbird and prospective client (Diaz), he then tangles with her ruthless, lowlife goon of a boyfriend (Greene). Lively, imaginative comedy with big laughs and nifty effects that almost make you feel like you're watching a live-action cartoon. The violence borders on extreme, but Carrey is in peak form and provides more than enough classic moments to make up for it. A must for Carrey fans. ***",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
S-s-s-s-mokin'!,"Jim Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss, a ""zero"" as the film tagline says, who never speaks his mind about anything. The typical mild-mannered guy.After Stanley finds an enchanted mask under a bridge one day, though, everything changes. He goes from ""zero to hero"". But first, he plays around with his new found menacing powers.Calling the mask a hero is like calling Hitler kind of a good guy. The mask makes Stanley rob banks, scare people and more. He's half-hero.""The Mask"" is not great, but it fits Carrey's film persona quite well. He bounces off the wall (literally) and just doesn't sit still.

"""The Mask"" is, and forever will be, SMOKIN'!","""The Mask"" was the movie that introduced my family to Jim Carrey. And we all thought that it was great. Carrey plays unlucky bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss, who one night finds an ancient mask. When he puts it on, he turns into sort of a cartoon character; think Roger Rabbit on acid. The really great thing about the movie is that they just turn Carrey loose. Anything that you can imagine him doing, he does here. A particularly funny scene is when the police tell him to freeze, you'd better believe that he freezes! All in all, Jim Carrey's humor will never get old. He may have given his all-time funniest performance in ""The Mask"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of Jim Carrey's Better Comedies,"Combining Jim Carrey with a bunch of giddy special effects seems like a redundancy, since Carrey himself IS a special effect. But that's just what this film does, with mostly entertaining results.Carrey plays a nerd who finds a mask that transforms him into a superhero when he wears it. Cue lots of intentionally cartoonish effects reminiscent of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?""The film features an early role for Cameron Diaz as a love interest for Carrey.The film was Academy Award nominated for its visual effects, but it lost the award to the much subtler and more impressive effects of ""Forrest Gump.""Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
This movie is a scream!!!,"If you ask me, 'The Mask' is Jim Carrey's best work ever. It's his best movie and the only one of him I find really great. It's not a movie without its faults, but it's original, imaginative, creative and has very good comical gags. It's a classic. Or, to use only one word to describe it: ""Smokin!""Jim Carrey can be two things: either a really funny comedian either a comedian who does his job well but overacts, although no one can deny that there is a genius inside this man. In 'The Mask' he is awesome. I consider this one of his best actings of all time, if not his very best.In 'The Mask' Jim Carrey portrays Stanley Ipkiss, a clerk in a nice Edge City bank. He is a very nice and easy-going guy with great sense of humor (which matches his funny name). He is «the nicest guy», yet shy and somewhat depressed and he does not have much success in his job and personal life. He doesn't have much friends, except for his co-worker Charlie and his loyal dog Milo (a Jack Russell Terrier). Stanley likes to watch cartoons (particularly a Tex Avery one with a whistling wolf), decorates his apartment with items from these cartoons and he has the most unusual pajama :)Jim Carrey also portrays the title character (The Mask), which is the other side of Stanley Ipkiss... or at least what he wants to be but can't be without the mask. The mask gives him superpowers and courage to do things he wouldn't be able to do without it. For example, he can dance like Fred Astaire, Gumby and Barishnikov (all together) - and he can flirt with the gorgeous Tina Carlyle. The Mask is a cartoonish figure that can do incredible things.This film is a crazy comedy, a film that surpasses the limits of imagination. Yet, despite its cartoonish humor, it also works well as a thriller and has a dark atmosphere. At the same time, this movie is clearly inspired (in many ways) on several cartoons, such as the Looney Tunes, Tex Avery's 'Red Hot Riding Hood' and even the live action/animation movie 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit'. The movie also has great sceneries and backgrounds, as well as great lines, nice special effects and its magic.Cameron Diaz in this movie... my goodness! Is there any guy who wouldn't fall in love with her in this film? She was really a stunning beauty in this film. She was absolutely at her hottest and most sensual here: she was more curvy, sexier, so beautiful and her smile was even more enchanting. Her role as the gorgeous and loving Tina Carlyle was a great acting debut for her. Plus, she was great in this role. In fact, she was a better actress in her early acting years than in more recent years. And she got slimmer with time.Cameron Diaz also sings very well in this film, with a husky, jazz-like voice. What a difference comparing to 'My Best Friend's Wedding', where she sings terribly. She was 21 years old in 'The Mask' but she surely looked older than that. She is really like a live-action version of Jessica Rabbit in this film.Other funny characters (along with Stanley Ipkiss) are Charlie Schumacher, Milo, Detective Doyle and the impatient Lt. Mitch Kellaway.Most of the soundtrack is great: the opening theme and other instrumental themes during the movie and even the cheerful songs ""Hey Pachuco"" and ""Cuban Pete"" - this last one is sung by Jim Carrey himself in a hilarious part where he (as The Mask) dances and makes the policemen dance either. It really makes one wanna dance.Most actors are pretty good in their roles: Jim Carrey, Cameron Diaz, Peter Riegert, Peter Greene, Ben Stein, Amy Yasbeck, Richard Jeni, Nancy Fish, Jim Doughan and Max.Max is the name of the dog that portrays Milo. The intelligence of that dog deserves to be mentioned. This breed of dog is known for its intelligence and loyalty, but also for being lovable, playful and stubborn dogs. Milo is all of that. Plus, Milo seems to understand everything they tell him. When his master is giving him orders, he moves his head as if he is understanding every word that is said. Plus, he climbs a considerably tall wall to rescue Stanley and we can see in his eyes when he is feeling fear, joy and sadness, for example. What a fabulous dog actor!The loaner... what a piece of junk! That car makes its own scenes hilarious! Why? Simply because of what it is: a charger in a junkyard.Jim Carrey makes this movie as good as it is. I believe that this movie couldn't possibly be this good without the great Jim Carrey. This role was made for him and couldn't be played by other than him.This should definitely be on Top 250.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Fantastic fun with incredible visuals.,"The film that propelled Jim Carrey to super-stardom, and rightfully so. Carrey is incredible in 'The Mask', and the film might not have worked so well without him in the lead. His dog, Milo, is also adorable!'The Mask' is so slapstick and stupid, yet incredibly entertaining - and funny! The film pays tribute to Looney Tunes cartoons, and actually plays like a live action cartoon. The film boasts incredible visuals not seen before at the time, and still holds so well by today's standard. The sound effects are also very effective. The Club scene is truly awesome - not to mention that famous dance scene! The Cuban Pete scene is so much fun. (Jim Carrey actually performed the song himself, and the song peaked at No. 31 on the Official Charts).If you're looking for lighthearted fun with loads of action, humor and jaw-dropping visuals, 'The Mask' is the perfect choice.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Incredible success when seen as a surrealistic cinematic pastiche,"Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a bit of a dorky pushover. For example, he buys hot concert tickets to try to get a date with a fellow bank employee he's been pining after, but she easily scams him into keeping the tickets for herself, and he is too weak to publicly object. But when he comes across an ancient mask of Lodi long ago discarded by Vikings who tried to bury the ""troublesome object"" at the ""end of the Earth"", he discovers it has the power to unlock his true self--suave, smooth-talking, manic, a bit dangerous, and a hopeless romantic.The Mask was a perfect vehicle for Jim Carrey. It not only allowed provided the perfect justification to flamboyantly engage in his rubber-faced antics in a manner even more over-the-top than what he'd become famous for, but it provided an opportunity to stretch his acting chops towards a more serious side at just the right time in his career, paving the way for later work such as Man on the Moon (1999), The Majestic (2001) and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004).The success of the film wholly depends on Carrey, as he has to sell his characters' frenzied insanity so that it's believable as a reflection of Stanley's inner self while at the same time likable but teetering on the edge of becoming obnoxiously overbearing. Of course, the amazing special effects and make-up help, as well as the clever script and more than competent directing and cinematography, but with the wrong actor in the part, the whole affair could have easily collapsed. The other cast members are fine in supporting roles, with Cameron Diaz coming across as being almost otherworldly beautiful, but Carrey is rarely off-screen, and rightly so.The Mask is notable for both spoofing almost the whole history of cinema while at the same time respectfully paying homage to it. The audience is treated to everything from silent film slapstick to lavish musical numbers (with excellent songs), frenzied Tex Avery-styled animation to gangster film suspense. On its surface, the film is a crazy, often funny, hyperactively paced cinematic pastiche.The subtext about identity and public faces versus private selves is interesting, but not the focus. It would be fine to explore further, but to do so in this particular film would have taken too much time away from Carrey's surrealistic tour de force. Besides, we've had later films where that subtext has been closer to the heart of a story, such as Catwoman (2004), and where it was very thoroughly and competently dealt with.Many aspects of The Mask differed from the comic book source material, but this is a case where the changes led to such an excellent result that most people have forgotten about the source material and primarily remember Carrey's performance in this film as definitive.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Plus, it's one of Carrey's best movies and one of the best comedy movies of all time",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Mask,"Jim Carrey is the drippy bank-clerk ""Ipkiss"" who is always looking for love but who never seems to make much progress. Then one night he spots something floating in the river. Thinking it's a man, he goes to the rescue but it turns out to just be a mask that we know has recently been released from a locked casket deep beneath the waves. He takes it home, and whilst inspecting it soon realises that it can attach itself to his face and turn him into a suave and witty character (albeit with a bright green face) who has no difficulty exuding the charm. That's handy because we are now introduced to the charming ""Tina"" (Cameron Diaz) so maybe the mask can help him woo her? The thing about this mask, though, is that it has a mischievous streak - it's enables it's users desires both good and bad, too, and of course it isn't long before the police ""Kellaway"" (Peter Riegert) are on the case as the mask brings out the conflicting side of it's owner's personality and some trouble beckons. It's an adequate vehicle for Carrey and he owns the show from start to finish. He's charismatic and entertaining but I just never found him funny. His presentation of humour is just too brash and in your face. There's nothing remotely subtle or sophisticated about it, and though it is lively and really doesn't hang around at all, I found it just a bit too repetitious and after about twenty minutes it reminded me of ""Bugsy Malone"" (1976) only without the custard pies. Like Steve Martin, Jim Carrey's style of comedy just didn't hit the spot for me, and though this is certainly one of his better efforts and Diaz adds a star quality to the affair, it's all just a little too pantomime slick for me.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

One of the greatest comedies I have ever seen,"Actually, I saw The Mask by accident. I wet to the cinema with my friend to watch something. When we arrived at the cinema and saw the poster showing The Mask we did not feel like watching it. But as it was a long way home we decided to go and see the film. And we enjoyed the movie so much that we decided to go to see it next day again. The first time we watched it we did not catch everything as our eyes were flooded with tears of laugh and our bellies hurt form laugh cramps. The story is really catching and Jim Carry is simply fabulous. The plot makes you think what it would be like if you had the mask and what you would do with it. Stanley Ippkiss in his funny quest made me be happy with what I am and what I have. The Mask is undoubtedly one of my most favorite comedies and it has a steady place on my video shelf.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Still smokin' after all these years,"Years ago this was one of my favorite comedies but when I rewatched it recently I was prepared to find that it hadn't stood the test of time. Happily, I was proved wrong.In case you don't know, the premise of this film is that 'Mr. Nice Guy' Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) happens upon a magical mask that transforms the wearer into a reflection of their innermost desires. In Ipkiss's case it changes him from a unassertive, hopeless romantic into a love-crazed wildman. The story wasn't exactly going to win any awards but it is a great showcase for some inventive comedy.Probably the reason why this movie still entertains me is because of the sheer cartoonishness of The Mask's mannerisms. Carrey is perfectly suited to mimic the sort of exaggerated physical comedy that you'd usually see in animated shorts of a bygone era. Then there's ILM to fill in the blanks with some pretty nifty special effects.This was also the introduction of Cameron Diaz, who was indeed smokin' at the time. She's charming and has pretty good chemistry with Carrey. The supporting cast is better than you might expect, with Peter Greene great as the menacing Dorian Tyrell, Peter Riegert surprisingly ideal as Lt. Kellaway and even a typically understated appearance by Ben Stein.The direction is nothing to write home about but there are a few musical numbers that have a cool, jazzy flavour to them. Like the physical comedy, they're like something out of a bygone era, and all the more welcome for that.So, there you have it; a film that's good for a few chuckles. Underrated and certainly one of Carrey's best comedic performances.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Awesome!,This is easily Jim Carrey's greatest picture! Not only that but in my opinion this was one of the funniest films of the `90s. This is such a fun movie that you can see it 10 times and it's still as fun as the first time. The film stars Jim Carrey in another amazing performance and the BEAUTIFUL Cameron Diaz in her debut.Also this is kind of like the Rocky Horror Picture Show of my generation.

"From the opening credits to the electrifying final sequence, ""The Mask"" is a 98 minutes of pure fun without commitment, marked by a show of special effects","The 1990s, without a doubt, were very prolific for Jim Carrey and propelled his already precedent career as a comedian to stardom. There are countless films from this period: Dumb and Dumber, Ace Ventura, The Liar and in The Mask, Jim Carrey possibly had one of his most notorious roles. Based on the unknown comic created by John Arcudi and Doug Mahnke, the film was initially planned as a horror film. Fortunately, the producers saw that the film would do much better as an adventurous comedy. They had little idea how right this decision was. The success of the film was so great that soon after, a wave of comic book adaptations began, most of which were also unknown, but with failed results, such as: ""Tank Girl"" (1995), ""Judge Dredd"" (1995), ""Barb Wire"" (1996), ""The Phantom"" (1996), ""Spawn"" (1997) and ""Steel"" (1997), starring basketball star Saquile O'neal.Chuck Russell (director of Burning the Archives, with Arnold Schwarzenegger) is responsible for commanding this hilarious story in which banker Stanley Ipkiss (Carrey) accidentally discovers a mask that gives him incredible powers and helps him to conquer a girl and save her life. City of bandits, in addition to giving you a real injection of self-esteem. Ipkiss is the true picture of the loser. Clumsy, without self-esteem, without self-esteem and without professional perspectives, the guy drags himself to work every day and lives something very different from what he would like.In the introductory minutes, Ipkiss offers a co-worker a pair of tickets to an event believing it would be her date for the night. However, the girl says that she is with a friend in the city and could not leave her alone. What he does? He leaves both invitations with her believing he has made a big step forward in his attempts to win her over. His luck begins to change when the explosive blonde played by Cameron Diaz enters the scene, in his first big role in Hollywood. Ipkiss is instantly attracted to her (forgetting that minutes before he was flirting with someone else) and his life begins to change radically. When Ipkiss finds the mask and discovers its incredible powers, all pent-up thoughts and desires come to life. That's how this weird hero is born who wants to do good, correct injustices and offer delicious revenge against the people who bother and trouble Ipkiss's life so much.The most interesting part of his story is that The Mask is a being that completely escapes the standards of reality, so that we seem to be watching one of the classic cartoons by the Looney Toones (who, by the way, receive a tribute in this film). , but with real actors, in the personification of a hilarious green-faced hero capable of anything. Incidentally, it might even be unusual to classify ""The Mask"" as a hero, since he completely deviates from the profile of a standard superhero: he does not fight evil to do justice, but all his actions and powers are used to satisfy yourself. After all, which superhero would rob a bank? This is the great triumph of the script that manages to completely escape the clichés.Mike Werb's script, despite being simple, has no flaws, presenting a very fun and surreal story, always varying at the right time when humor enters with hilarious scenes and adventure scenes. Along with a brilliant art direction, it was possible to create a true color contrast, bringing the film closer and closer to a cartoon look. We can clearly see these contrasts, in more than striking scenes like the one where The Mask dances with Tina Carlyle at the Coco Bongo nightclub, and in the scene where he manages to make a street full of police officers dance to the sound of his music. The text itself has a considerable distance from the source material, since the comic is much darker in contrast to the playful and carnivalesque tone of the film's Máskara, which undoubtedly contributed to the film's success, especially with the child audience. Hardly a child of the 90s was not a fan of Jim Carrey, who in this role found the perfect character for himself, after all, all of Jim Carrey's typical grimaces and grimaces are welcome and desirable for The Mask, and nobody can complain about that.""The Mask"" is nothing more than an intense (and exaggerated) metaphor to bring out everything that we hide in the depths of our soul. In a very expository way, when the protagonist visits a psychologist who explains exactly what is happening and makes us fear the threat of the villain, but which still works very well thanks to his protagonist's charisma and sense of humor. Both Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz are great in their roles and offer great fun to the audience with all the chemistry they show on the scene.Chuck Russell's direction is efficient. His aptitude for making horror films helped a lot to create quite unusual situations related to the title character, in addition to knowing how to create a tense atmosphere at the right time. As the film was initially planned as a horror, it is not surprising that his choice was made, since his curriculum included films such as the third part of the series ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and the remake of ""The Killing Bubble"".In addition, the film had excellent special effects for the time of its release in 1994, even receiving a nomination for the Visual Effects category at the Oscars. The film's humor, 24 years after its release, is still working and several scenes are still hilarious, such as the protagonist's non-sensical spirit, including the scene of the police officers dancing and the triumphant return to Coco Bongo (the most popular club in Edge City, location of the film) wearing the mask after being stopped at the door as Stanley Ipkiss.Naturally it is not a perfect film, the construction of the romance with Tina, role, by the way, that also leveraged the career of Cameron Diaz, is totally rushed and without motivations that make sense, besides the villain who is bad for being bad and is for that's right, but, honestly, seeing the film and considering its purpose and the fun it provides, they do not in any way disturb the experience of a film of uncompromising humor, such as the animations of the 30s and 40s to which the film makes reference.Despite everything, the greatest merit of the success (and quality) of ""The Mask"" comes down to one name: Jim Carrey. The star, who until then was best known only for his role as the animal detective ""Ace Ventura"", gives a show in the role, which is probably his best comic role in cinema. It is impossible to imagine The Mask with another actor in his place and probably, with another actor in his role, the production would be a real failure, as his interpretation is the essence of the entire development of the film. Everyone knows Carrey's talent, but here, he manages to show his personality change with such mastery, that it's even difficult to look for examples that compare to the height. Whether as the shy and clumsy Stanley Ipkiss, or as the irreverent Máskara, Carrey demonstrates such perfection that at no time does he seem to be the same actor in action, given such a distinction between the two personalities.""The Mask"" is the kind of film that no matter how much time passes, it never seems outdated in the face of its enormous grandeur, and we never get tired of watching it again. As much as we already know the jokes, we never stop having fun. From the opening credits to the electrifying final sequence, we can follow 98 minutes of pure fun without commitment, marked by a show of special effects. There are those who deny that The Mask is a classic, but there are no arguments in this world capable of convincing a young man from the 1990s to believe that. It's a film that will never grow old in our hearts, and one that is certainly worth seeing and enjoying for any generation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
It made me read the comics,"The Mask is a character you will never forget, and Jim Carrey was perfect for the role.

Jim Carrey at his slapstick best,"On the face of it (sorry, couldn't resist), The Mask is a fairly awful movie. The story is ridiculous and the acting, by and large, is quite atrocious. It's essentially a cartoon with real-life humans superimposed onto it. However, thanks to the sheer brilliance of Jim Carrey, it's actually quite enjoyable. Carrey doesn't just provide huge comedy value with his hilarious slapstick antics as The Mask, he also plays the tepid Stanley Ipkiss delicately and with great restraint. His adorable sidekick Milo is a showstopper and really adds to the feelgood factor.And has there ever been a more perfectly beautiful woman than Cameron Diaz in this movie? The teenage version of me that first watched this in the 90s would probably say no.As long as you aren't expecting anything more than a screwball comedy with an over-the-top storyline and pantomime acting, I would highly recommend The Mask. It's goofy and flamboyant and Carrey is brilliant. It drags on a little too long and the bad guys get a bit tiresome but it's still a very entertaining watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"When I wear this mask, I can be whatever I want...","A quite important number of movies paid a tribute to Tex Avery's cartoons like ""who framed Roger Rabbit?"". ""The Mask"" ranks among them and is a great success, although this movie takes back some characteristics suitable to American movies and particularly this one: the transition for a character from a low level to the degree of hero. Here, the main protagonist (Jim Carrey) is introduced as a clumsy person in the beginning. But the discovery of a weird mask will turn his life upside down and make him become the hero of ""Edge City"". This mask will also allow him to conquer Cameron Diaz's heart and to triumph over a gang who wished to take the city under control.As a consequence, the movie uses a globally thin and convenient screenplay but fortunately, it's compensated by the funny moments where ""the Mask"" tops the bill and this is the occasion to intervene a fanciful, but efficient humor that finds again the devastating tone of the cartoons from the forties and the fifties. It also doesn't hesitate in parodying the gangster movies from the thirties and even ""gone with the wind"".Jim Carrey's performance remains one of his best to date. He's well directed and never hams it up unlike the silly ""Ace Ventura in Africa"". Let's add an amusing description of the Kellaway cop (Peter Riegert).A movie eventually entertaining enough to sustain the interest in spite of its weaknesses.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Smokey!!!!!!!!! 7/10,"""The Mask"" is one of Carry's classic films and most remarkable ones. This is the kind of movies where Jim Carry can let all his humor and comedy burst out like a parade. His portrayal both as Stanley Ipkiss and The Mask are hilarious and compelling. At one point his a complete loser during the plot and afterwards he receives this huge confidence by using the mask. It's a good conflict between two personalities of one character. Every scene with Carry as the figure of the mask is wild and funny as hell. Just shows you his such a talented person. The only thing I may have against the film is that it is another origin film of how a regular person becomes a hero. Many origin films have been made and many of them either by Marvel or DC. So it would have been nice to have a different plot going on the movie instead of the same origin story. Overall it is a fun movie to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

How to cast Jim Carrey,"It's hard to use Jim Carrey in a movie.  He's very good at his rapid-fire mimicry routine, but how can it ever be anything other than a diversion from both character and story?  (Very rarely is it a pleasant diversion.  `Ace Ventura' was unendurable.)  And yet, what else can you do with him?The `Mask' solves the problem so neatly it almost cheats.  The story is ABOUT someone with a double life - so by day, Carrey does all the character and story stuff, and by night, wearing the mask, he does his stand-up schtick.  The two are as integrated as they need to be.  It's pulled off with such an air of innocence I can't possibly complain.  SOME of the clichés (those to do with the police especially) are so very worn out that even the most thorough of movie-goers is surprised to find them still alive; but the writer seems to have been honestly unaware that they were clichés, so that's okay.I was told that the film is saturated with animation in-jokes.  I couldn't spot very many.  Stanley-with-the-mask has the soul of a Tex Avery cartoon character: I suspect that's all there is to it.  The computer animation, or the computer-enhancement of Carrey's animation, is tastefully done.  It never looks pasted over the top of the footage the way so much computer animation does.  (`The Mask' failed to win an Oscar in the special effects category - like so many other more deserving films, it was beaten by `Forrest Gump'.)  The Cuban dance numbers are irresistible, as is Stanley's pet dog.  Sure, `The Mask' is no masterpiece, but it's a clever, charming film that richly deserved its runaway success.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Hugely enjoyable comedy, and by far one of Carrey's better films","I truly enjoy this film. It isn't the best movie ever or anything like that but it is still a hugely enjoyable comedy in my opinion. And I also think that along with Liar Liar and The Truman Show that The Mask is one of Jim Carrey's better movies. Here Carrey's role is split, his mild mannered banker and a wild, crazy superhero. Either way, he excels in this film, he is completely in his element and completely unpredictable. He is helped by the special effects, which are utterly amazing, a truly imaginative and sophisticated visual style that worked so well here. Here because of the special effects, Carrey moves around at whirlwind speed, pops his eyeballs and swaps parts of his anatomy for his cartoon equivalents and you know what it is jolly funny. There are so many good scenes though my favourite was the Bugs Bunny-style Cuban Pete routine. Also superb are the script, which is as funny and as imaginative as the film itself and the suitably tongue in cheek music score. Not to mention the adorable pet dog, underrated Peter Reigert, Peter Greene's Dorian and gorgeous Cameron Diaz. Overall, hugely enjoyable, funny and imaginative, so much better than its sequel Son of the Mask which I disliked so much I try to forget it exists. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
To laugh until you can not bear it,"The film is slightly inspired by a Gothic comic magazine, where a mask is responsible for the irrational and dangerous attitudes of several people. The film, devoid of this negative charge, is a comedy that marked the nineties and revolves around Stanley Ipkiss, a naive and romantic banking employee played by Jim Carrey. He is the happy owner of a rudimentary wooden mask, of Viking origin, which he discovers to have the gift of freeing the desires and behaviors normally withdrawn by people due to fears or social conventions. The mask also gives its wearer an unusual resistance, speed and invulnerability.The film was one of the most thrilling successes of the career of Jim Carrey, who was for a decade the king of comedy in Hollywood. The actor shows to be tireless, giving the film a contagious energy. Carrying the film on its back until the end, Carrey laughs and makes laugh countless times, never losing the focus of his character and all the emotions he need to show. After all, Ipkiss is not a clown, but a loser with deep feelings and a lot of solitude. A true test of versatility which paved the way for other comedies, without closing doors to a lot of dramatic works, in which the actor would prove to be resourceful and talented. Cameron Diaz enters the film through a very simple and little-worked character. Thought as a supporting character, it would have been mere figuration with lines if the actress did not strive to do a decent job with the meager material she received. Special effects and animation are a focal point of the film, and have been brilliantly performed. The photograph is very elegant, with attractive colors and a good light.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Good comedy,"This takes place in Edge City where we meet Stanley Ipkiss (Carrey), a mild-mannered banker who seems to get taken advantage of. His luck changes when he finds an ancient green mask that transforms him into a smooth prankster. Diaz makes her debut here as sultry singer, Tina Carlyle who wins his heart, Greene (Pulp Fiction) plays her corrupt boyfriend, Dorian Tyrell, Riegert (Animal House) plays Police Lieutenant, Kellaway, Yasbeck (Problem Child 1 & 2) plays reporter, Peggy Brandt and the late, Jeni plays, Stanley's friend, Charlie. Jim is great in this, he & Cameron have good chemistry, the make-up & effects are terrific and Randy Edelman's score is also good.

Is that Jim Carrey's face or just special effects?,"Based on the original, highly violent comic, The Mask bursts on to the screen with dazzling special effects and Jim Carrey's face. The story of the comic book has changed slightly, making the evil mask turn loser Stanley Ipkiss into a hero, rather than a cop killing psycho. I believe in among all the special effects, most males will see this movie for the co-star Cameron Diaz. Jim Carrey definitely suits the role, and so does his dog Milo, who steals the spotlight in some places. If you're looking for a laugh, you may as well pick this up.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Jim Carrey is the man,"In The Mask a demonic visage gets released upon the world and ends up in the hands of Stanley Ipkiss, a frumpy bank clerk with something of a bone to pick with the world. It transforms him into a living cartoon character, with the power of violent slapstick on his side. And in a moment of perfect casting they got Jim Carrey to play this role.The idea is a fun one and Carrey is definitely enough of a rubber face to pull it off, even though the actual mask is mostly handled with CGI. It mostly captures the essence of Carrey, but I have to admit that something is lost in the translation. Carrey is very good when out of the mask, but I have to admit that part of his charm is the fact that he's so cartoon like in real life. When you make him an actual cartoon character, it loses something.I also have to admit that the humour is missing something here. I read that they had to scrub a lot of the visual gags for budget reasons, and it kind of shows. There are some good jokes here and there, but most of them are merely okay. The movie is at its best when it simply allows Carrey to sink into a comedy routine, but that's rarely the case.Still, if you're a Jim Carrey fan, the film is definitely worth a watch. Not one of his best, but there's enough here to please.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Strange Case of Thespian Jim and Comedian Carrey,"It's interesting that the film that does so well at solving the core problem of JC's style is his first big, starring role. He is hilarious when nothing stops him; it's really that simple. However, his schtick works best for sketch stuff, where the laughs are all straightforward and throw-away. For a feature, it really works best if you care about the characters, if they're credible and relatable. They are here. The risk at using extreme stuff for material is that, at the end of the day, we can't recognize it. We can't get completely into it. Here, the goofy antics are entirely linked to the alter ego that he also plays, explained as the catharsis for a repressed ""nice guy"". His facial expressions(clear through the well-done make-up) and voices and all are put to excellent use. The humor in this tends to be over the top, silly and wacky, and if you're up for it and enjoy such, you're likely to love that aspect of this. It's got inspiration from the classic Tex Avery cartoons, and a wide array of pop culture references. There is cleverness and parody as well. Ben Stein and his bone-dry wit are marvelous here. The plot is good, and in spite of being relatively typical stuff, it does surprise the audience. All parts are well-cast, and Diaz shines; it's no wonder this gave her a career. Pacing's great, this is never boring. The effects are perhaps dated today, but they show a real energy and enthusiasm, they all get the job done, and you can tell that these guys wanted to put something specific up on the screen, and would not stop trying 'till they did so, and that is always wonderful to see in a business we associate with jaded, cynical attitudes. The tone and look are spot-on, for walking a difficult balance between grotesque and cute. Editing and cinematography are well-done. The odd thing with this is that, for all the stuff that's written almost with them in mind, this isn't all child-friendly. While it is somewhat restrained, the violence and occasional disturbing content isn't necessarily something all parents will be OK with their kid seeing. In fact, I believe there are a bunch of people who did find watching this to be too intense when they were young. Nonetheless, if you think you'll be fine, and you like imagination-packed thrill-rides, then jump on. You won't want it to end. The DVD contains two entertaining and informational commentary tracks(the older of them has a little moderate to strong language), four documentaries that I will review individually since they have their own pages here on the site, two deleted scenes with the option of hearing the director go into why they were taken out, and what his intentions were with them, and finally, a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any and all fans of Carrey, the style of jokes and gags, and the genres of fantasy and/or romance. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"I don't normally watch Jim Carry, but when i do, i do it right.","I love the Mask. The movie was just like a big cartoon, and fortunately enough, I am immature enough to love this childish humor. The effects were acceptable because it was meant to look like a cartoon. The jokes were funny if you have a little bit of a child at heart. I may be overrating this film, and i feel as i am, but its just the love of these nostalgia cartoons that makes me love this film. I cant say anything more, its just him Carry's best film to me, and deserves a little more recognition. This movie set out a cartoon series(which was not as good since the joke of putting a cartoon in real life is gone) and eventually a sequel, which i did not enjoy much either. The beauty was Jim Carrys over the top acting in this role. It does not work in many characters but is PERFECT for the chaotic mask.

"Wonderfully enjoyable comedy, and one of the best movies from the 1990s","I always loved this movie. It's not the best movie ever made but it's among the best movies from the 1990s and one of Jim Carrey's best movies that he has ever made. He was born for this role since he has such a rubbery face and he is very energetic movement-wise. Here he is split in his dual role of Stanley Ipkiss, at day a mild mannered banker and at night when he wears the mask, he unleashes his true self: The Mask, a manic cartoon-like superhero. Thanks to CGI effects that were new for 1994 movie-goers, Carrey spins like a whirlwind when he wears the mask and moves pretty much like a cross between the Road Runner and Taz. The script is clever and funny just like the movie itself and the performances are all best-of from the stars' careers. Jim Carrey is in his natural element and Cameron Diaz here in her debut is lovely as a mobster's girlfriend. All the supporting characters, including Milo the dog and the police detective, are nice to look at. And the soundtrack is one of those soundtracks that will remain stuck in your memory forever. All in all, a great comedy highly enjoyable and much much better than the wretched Carrey and Diaz-less sequel SON OF THE MASK, that I loathed it so much that I only try to forget that it was made in the first place.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Superlative superhero comedy,"Being a superhero comics reader, I tend to see The Mask primarily as a superhero movie. When I look at the best superhero movies yet made, the list of really good ones is quite short. The first X-Men movie was good, the Spider-Man movies are decent, and the best of the lot may be Mystery Men. I also like Sky High. But, one I frequently forget to consider is The Mask. It is actually just as good as Mystery Men, and so one of the two best superhero movies yet. It is a total comedy classic, also in terms of Jim Carrey's acting. Everything is done perfectly and for reasons that make sense to the plot, and it's just fantastically funny: ""I can explain everything!!"" ""Explain THIS!"" ""Ummmmm....""Taking its cues from Tex Avery cartoon is genius, and complementing everything with superb (for the time) special effects that still hold up today is just brilliant.

Utterly pointless,"Jim Carrey is widely known for a select few movies that he did in the mid to late 90's, along with a couple in the early 2000's. The Mask is one of the most well known of these films. Carrey stars as Stanley Ipkiss, a lowly bank clerk who stumbles upon a mysterious mask that turns him into a maniacal green faced nutcase who has the ability to do anything. The first thing he uses this mask for is to rob a bank, which sets off a whole series of events involving a ruthless band of gangsters and a beautiful night club singer named Tina Carlyle, played by Cameron Diaz in her very first feature film.Now, despite this being a well known Jim Carrey film, it's also a very bad film. This is where physical humor blows up in your face and becomes unbearably moronic and not funny in the slightest. I honestly feel sorry for the talented and actually funny Jim Carrey for being subjected to such idiocracy in this film. He can't even save the overall pathetic attempts at comedy. The jokes and physical humor in this movie range from absolutely atrocious to almost worth a chuckle, but the latter is far and few between. The majority of this film is just dull and lifeless dribble that wants to be funny but can't find the right chords to stroke. It misses the mark again and again as it becomes more ridiculous and stupid as the film goes on. Needless to say, about ten minutes into the film I couldn't wait for it to end.The problem with a film like this is that it knows its all about the comedy. It only seeks to deliver funny jokes and entertaining gags, rather than a deep and intellectual storyline and skillfully woven character development. The Mask obviously has neither of the aforementioned things, but it doesn't have the funny to replace them. The only way to really put it is that this is just not a funny movie. It isn't even painful to watch bad, it's just so dull, so lifeless, and so sloppily made and poorly constructed that I can't think anything of it.I don't want to give the impression that I possess a searing hatred for The Mask, I only want it to be known that it is just not a good film and not something worth watching. It's a waste of an hour and forty minutes, not because it is the worst movie ever made, but because it is so underwhelming and so forgettable that you accomplish absolutely nothing by watching it. There are plenty of other Jim Carrey movies worth checking out before you waste your time with The Mask.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of the best comedies of the 90s,"THE MASK is the story about a nice guy, Stanley Ipkiss, who is unhappy. He has a landlord who always yells at him, a boss who always berates him, and people always take advantage of his nice nature. One day, his life changes. He comes upon a mask in the lake and puts it on. Upon putting on the mask, he is transformed into a kind of comedic troublemaker who can do anything. What results is one of the funniest and most enjoyable comedies made in the past twenty years. Jim Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss totally perfect. His character is so quirky and likable, and yet he manages to let loose way further as the mask. The mask, in question, only contributes to an already very rubber face. The visual effects are all very inventive and original, especially for the time! Cameron Diaz makes a stunning acting debut as the woman of Stanley's dreams. I haven't even mentioned the big bank heist, references to Tex Avery, the climactic fight scene, the two incredibly brilliant dance sequences, or the adorable dog yet. All I have to say is that all these subplots are balanced perfectly. There are some incredible sight gags herein, the exploding windshield early in the film still makes me laugh. This is a wonderful film and it certainly entertained me more than than most 90s comedies. I highly recommend this film if you're looking for a fun laugh.Pros:-Excellent performances from Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz-Amazing visual effects-awesome dog performance-the two dance scenes to end all dance scenesCons:-cheesy villain and resolution to that-it ends a little too quickly",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"You'll love it when Carrey does the chick chicky boom, chick chicky boom!","Not only does Chuck Russell's The Mask deliver one of Jim Carrey's best performances, a shed-load of brilliant anarchic humour, special effects that still look fresh today, and some excellent musical numbers, but it is also the film that introduced movie audiences worldwide to the charms of the delectable Cameron Diaz. In short, The Mask is SMOKIN'!Carrey plays mild mannered nice guy Stanley Ipkiss, who happens upon a strange mask that, when worn, enables the wearer to become a suave, indestructible heroalbeit a very mischievous one. Unfortunately, it also helps to get Stanley into a whole heap of trouble, after his wise-cracking alter-ego upsets local gangster Dorian Tyrell, first by ruining one of his heists, and then by making out with his gorgeous girlfriend Tina (Cameron Diaz).Director Russell expertly handles the non-stop madcap action, which is heavily influenced by the manic cartoons of Tex Avery and Looney Tunes (both are referenced in the film), and funny man Carrey gives his career the boost it so badly needed with an unforgettable turn that perfectly showcased his manic style, bringing him to the attention of Hollywood's big hitters.Packed full of eye-popping make-up and visual effects, and an even more eye-popping debut from Diaz (who sets the screen alight from the moment she saunters out of the rain, sexily clad in a figure hugging red dress), The Mask is 97 minutes of pure unadulterated fun for lovers of outrageous, zany, slapstick humour.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Why I still watch movies (metaphorically speaking),"Although I prefer the classic 40's and 50's 5 minute cartoons of Tex Avery to this homage, I must admit it still makes me hoot with laughter whenever I see it. One of the few 90's films I've liked (out of only a few more) I think it has the edge city over Ace Ventura, equally memorable for Jim Carrey taking off Captain Kirk in the dolphin tank as well as the horrible undisciplined ending.This also has as eye-candy a shapely Cinderella Cameron Diaz who is marvellous - as someone to paint a few little dresses on. Rather smoking for the eyes, I concur with Wolfie. The biggest star however was Milo, what a masterful yet restrained performance, basically as straight-dog to Ipkiss in either form. The two cops were a throwback to 40's style films too, such as the Falcon, Boston Blackie etc - no one is that dumb in real life, uh?The Mask has to be the best comedy film in decades, probably the best film of the 90's full stop, and I'm so glad a sequel never materialised.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Sssssmokin'!,"Classic of classics. Without a doubt, one of the best comedies of all times. It's a complete movie. The script is fabulous and the management even better. Chuck Russell in his best work gives us a series of unforgettable scenes, it would be impossible to choose one, but among the best could mention: the artistic number of the character of Cameron Diaz in Coco Bongo in the style of Rita Hayworth in ""Gilda"", scene of theft In the bank and the scene in which the Mask gives its deserved to punk-dressed criminals.With regard to the cast, all of them showed off, from the protagonists to the secondary characters. Jim Carrey (The Mask) in his best performance in a comic film, with every gesture, every nonsense, every madness, robs us of laughter from beginning to end. Cameron Diaz (Tina) impeccable in her debut as actress, wasting sensuality and sweetness at the same time, thanks to that majestic body, that blond hair and sky-blue eyes. Peter Greene perfect as a villain, just by looking at that good face and those deep blue eyes and you know who the bad guy is. The cops very awesome, as always the clever (Peter Riegert) and the clumsy (Jim Doughan). And last but not least, I do not know what it's called the dog that made Milo, but what a bonanza, by God, stole the show that little son of a female dog.As a curious fact, the film is based on the eponymous comic. Yes, nobody or almost nobody knows that. But since the film was filmed and because of its wide acceptance by the public, the comic came out of anonymity, one way or another.

Sure, it is a little stupid in ways but I rated it basically on it's point. The point was to be silly, and it succeeded at that. The Mask is a very good Jim Carrey performance and he is a very great actor who just loves to have fun. The film also introduces the stunning Cameron Diaz, I think this was her film debut and she did very well for her part.

The mystery of the mask itself, what happens to Ipkiss, the romantic story lines: they all get progressed and slowly revealed throughout the movie, and whether or not the answers are what we want, we get them. More importantly, we're not just given answers to make way for the action. The information is drip-fed at a decent pace so the audience can enjoy the scene and then shift focus afterwards.There also has a lot of the same feeling here that one may get from ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" where cartoons exist in the real world, so there is a technical feat accomplished here that could have drastically changed the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
somebody stop me,"You just have to appreciate the technicality and the visual effects that went into the production of this massive hit. The Mask introduced a character that we all started to love and cherish, a hero that can do absolutely anything his mind thinks of. This slap stick comedy showed how Jim Carrey became a good lead actor; he carried the show right from the start to the final battle, doing everything we see in the Warner bros cartoons.After this massive hit, an animated series was also done, introducing more villains and more takes into the life of Stanley Ipkiss.This movie ""The Mask"" is based on a series of comic books of the same name; the comic is the product of Dark Horse Comics and The Mask was introduced in the 80's based on a concept by the publisher Mike Richardson and created by writer John Arcudi and artist Doug Mahnke. Like in this movie the comic series follows a magical mask and its owner Stanley Ipkiss. When the mask is worn the wearer can bend reality, do the impossible physically and survive the unbelievable. All this is based on the wearer's depth of imagination which The Mask will then surpass.The plot is about a Mr. nice guy, Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) whom the world seems to step on. Things took a turn around for Ipkiss when he came across a magical mask, which gave him powers to do the impossible. But The Mask was uncontrollable and Ipkiss stepped on toes which were ready to do anything to kill the man behind the mask.The movie is filled with thrilling visual effects, and a wonderful cast. Jim Carrey was just exceptional. The Mask was also Cameron Diaz's first acting role, which later pushed her up the ladder as she now features in major movies yearly.The Mask was a huge box office hit making over 350 million from its 23 million production cost, it was also a critical acclaim, leaving behind it a trail of catchphrases in its time like ""smoking"" or ""somebody stop me"". Its high box office status made the makers approach Jim Carrey for a sequel, which he turned down (as Carrey believes making sequels are not challenging). The ideas for the sequel were then used in the animated series, which spawned two seasons. Later after 11 years, a sequel was made but it was unrelated to the first or the animated series, it was titled Son of The Mask which received high negative reviews and was a box office bomb, as the visual effects and the plot were lame and out of place, putting in consideration that it was made with over 84 million.Our hero The Mask is best portrayed here in this beautiful movie and it is a keeper.www.lagsreviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

But the difference is that its all amplified 10 times over and its all real! You actually combine all this wackiness into a very serious, realistic, dark and gritty world.

This premise allows Carrey to use his manic energy to the fullest without looking ridiculous.

A timeless classic,"One of my favourite movies as a kid, and a guilty pleasure as an adult. This movie has everything that a kid could be looking for in a movie. I introduced this to my 6 year old son recently and now its all he talks about, he mimics the various characters portrayed by The Mask and has even started getting his friends asking their mums and dads about it.10/10 from me, for the simple fact that it doesn't exactly what its supposed to, entertain families.Its a fun filled story packed with that old school slap stick comedy mixed with some cartoon parodies, all seamlessly blended by the master of laughs, Jim Carrey.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Hello Ms. Diaz,"Cameron Diaz ... what an introduction to the film world. While I reckon some may feel that her walking into this or how she is portrayed, is borderline sexist, you would be taking the fun out of the movie even before you started watching it. One thing is for sure: Jim Carrey is having as much fun as anyone can have. You can tell and it really comes through his performance and through the screen to anyone watching.There is a movie logic - so whatever happens here .. just suspend your disbelief and go with the flow! Good guys finish last ... unless they find something that changes their life(s). Rewatching this made me realize how good it is .. good actors involved too, but it is the Jim Carrey show no doubt about that. I do wonder why the sequel is rated so low ... the idea seems so foolproof that ... but I haven't seen that yet ... I just might watch it one day ... I think I have seen worse ... anyway, back to this! This is amazing, so there you go!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"I Just Didn't ""Get"" It","I just didn't ""get"" this movie, and its humour seemed to go straight over my head.Plot In A Paragraph: Bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a very nice man. Unfortunately, he is too nice for his own good and is a pushover when it comes to confrontations. After one of the worst days of his life, he finds a mask that depicts Loki, the Norse night god of mischief. Now, when he puts it on, he becomes his inner, self: a cartoons romantic wild man.This movie is filled with some awful actors and the humour in the movie seemed to rely solely on special effects turning Carrey into various cartoon characters. A massive plus point was Cameron Diaz (in one of her early roles) who looked incredibly hot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The reason why Jim Carrey is a superstar,"I don't even know where to start with this. On the one hand, it is a movie that is truly unique. On the other hand, it is not very enjoyable and it relies almost exclusively on the exaggerated physicality of Jim Carrey's performance.In many ways it is a very typical comedy of its time, in terms of the tonality of its humour. Yet there is something strangely timeless about it.On the surface it has the same sensibility as something like Dumb and Dumber except it is also a comic book superhero of sorts. By the way, it is amusing to see the perspective on superhero movies circa the ninties between this and Tim Burton's Batman. In both cases there is a uneasy mix of whimsical slapstick with something way more dark creepy and twisted. It is disturbing, but at the same time it is almost refreshing to see that kind of movie that doesn't follow that polished by-the-numbers Hollywood formula that we've seen over and over since then.The superhero element is a bit off, because there is no real tension in the narrative. The Mask's powers are not really defined and he is able to do whatever suits him in order to solve whatever happens. So the movie has to work as a comedy instead.Which leads to the film resting on Jim Carrey's shoulders. It is a performance that is at the same time exhilarating and annoying. It is kind of over-the-top and genius.It is not a bad film per se, but it has not aged as well as other classic comedies. So it will work for you if you want a taste of peak Jim Carrey, but not for much else unfortunately.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Jim Makes the Movie,"This is one of Carey's funniest movies.  The story may be just okay but with Jim's acting ability it is pulled of brilliantly.  The movie does have a few flaws with some overplayed parts but none of this really hurts the film.  If you do not like Jim Carey don't rent this film.  Why would you?  This movie was made for him.  I also believe this is the movie that Cameron Diaz looks her best in.  She is sexier in the long dresses than she is in the Angels movies.  One of the funniest characters in this movie is the dog.  You will love watching Milo do his thing.  I own this movie and watch it every now and then.  If you have not seen this movie, where have you been?  Rent it today.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Showcase For Carrey--But That's About It,"In 1994, Jim Carrey was the king of comedy. Somehow, the triplicate of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, Dumb & Dumber, and The Mask were all released in that year! While the former two on that list are all-time classics, The Mask is a bit of a different animal. Though a sterling showcase for Carrey's unique comedic energy, it isn't actually all that funny or coherent--especially when the camera pans away from the flexible funnyman for even a moment.For a very basic overview, The Mask tells the story of Stanley Ipkiss (Carrey)--a no-confidence sad sack who can't seem to get a break even when bombshell Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz) takes an interest in him. One day, however, Stanley discovers an ancient mask that when put on transforms him into a flamboyant green-hued cartoon character. His dalliances in the Mask persona run him a bit afoul of the law and also pit him against local gangster Dorian (Peter Greene) in a fight for Tina's attention.There is no doubt that when Carrey is on-screen--as The Mask especially, but also Ipkiss to a slightly lesser extent--he is an eye-magnet. Rarely will one ever see a performance brimming with this much energy. He is the perfect comic book character come to life. Diaz also makes quite an entrance--both literally and figuratively--in her first acting role.The problem with The Mask, however, is in trying to graft a coherent or interesting story upon Carrey's outlandishness. Because the humor here is in no way intellectual (more dependent on sight gags than anything) a plot is indeed required--but is as thin as one-ply tissue. As such, the first half of the film--Stanley finding the mask and experimenting with its effect on him--is far superior to the back half, which must give service to the police/mob aspects.Overall, I think The Mask is likely better for those who experienced it ""in the moment"" as opposed to years later when Carrey Mania is no longer in play. There are certainly some gut-busting moments, but too often it gets caught in the conundrum of needing the Mask on screen more but being unable to quite pull that off coherently.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Brilliant,"This was the perfect casting of Jim Carrey ever, and the best comic-book based film ever made. Hands down.And although Carrey has made other interesting and funny films, none have utilized his abilities as this practically made-for-Carrey film has.The Mask as a character itself is based on all of those cartoons with the redhaired dancer and the wolf, many were made during the WW-II years. One of them even had Red Riding Hood being eaten by the wolf at the end, or at least sitting in his pot.This was as clever casting as Robin Williams in ""Aladdin"" or ""Mrs Doubtfire"", something which we'd never see again. I believe there was even a sequel that is so im-memorable, that it's not even linked to this film in an IMDb search.That's where this film has a commonality with the Disney Aladdin films, you cannot do a sequel if you cannot reproduce a once in a lifetime performance.It's that personalities like Carrey and Williams are so dynamic that you can't just replace their characters with new actors.There were a lot of great character actors in this as well, including Carrey's landlady.This film could have had a good sequel, should have had one. I had never heard of this director, but he did a great job especially with the primitive CGI, very similar to Burton's work.It wasn't just Carrey, this was very well directed. And Cameron Diaz did not hurt, either.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Smoking!,"I enjoyed this film! That's saying a lot since I never liked the animated series which I grew up with. I just found it too weird and too crazy. But it works in this one. Especially with Jim Carrey as the lead role. I've noticed that Jim Carrey always gets the goofy and crazy roles. It was actually weird seeing him as a sane and normal bank clerk during the beginning of the movie. Regardless, I love Jim Carrey. He's a great actor.This was a pretty good film, considering I don't usually like crazy. The actors were great if you take into account that they're acting in a slapstick sort of comedy. It reminded me of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, actually. Though, I did like this one more. I also thought that the special effects were great for the 90's. Or maybe that's just me.In The Mask, Jim Carrey plays an average bank clerk who one day stumbles upon a mask which allows him to let loose and become crazy.

Considering it's not meant to be taken seriously it's not terrible, but even for a comedy it was lackluster.Jim Carrey was as good as he usually is whilst Cameron Diaz and everyone else where absolutely fine (although not as good, obviously).The movie is carried a lot by Jim Carrey and The Mask.

Jim Carrey stars in this somewhat amusing flick that is reminiscent of Saturday morning cartoons.,"Starring: Jim Carrey, Cameron Diaz, Peter Greene So, you should have been tipped off by the fact that this movie stars Jim Carrey that it's not really high on the intellectual scale plot-wise. Sure, it's amusing, but it gets less amusing as you get older. Fortunately my maturity level seldom increases dramatically, so I can unashamedly say that I do like this movie. It's just not great by any stretch.Stanley Ipkiss (Carrey) is a low-key quiet banker who keeps to himself for the most part, watches cartoons, and is a doormat for the general public. Then one night Stanley thinks he sees a body floating in the water beside a bridge, only when he gets to it he finds that there is no actual body. He does, however, find an interesting mask. A green mask made of wood. So he takes it home, not thinking too much of it.Then when he's home, he goes to try the mask on, only to find that it's more than a piece of wood. It sucks onto his face, leeches onto his personality, and brings out the wild side of Stanley Ipkiss that nobody ever thought existed. His character is not unlike watching a Saturday morning cartoon as far as the antics he gets into.Then when Stanley is The Mask he commits a few crimes, like robbing the bank he works at, vandalizing his auto repair shop, stuff like that. The police start looking for him and figure out that The Mask and Stanley are one and the same. Eventually a crime lord kind of guy finds Stanley and takes the mask from him, and it turns him into a very powerful, very evil being, capable of practically anything. Then of course Stanley has to stop him, blah blah blah, and that's about it plotwise.Like I said before, it's hardly an intellectual movie. It's semi-amusing and worth at least one watch, provided you don't have to pay more than three or four dollars to do so.Bottom line: 2.5 out of 4 (maybe a renter)",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Good film for Jim Carrey.,"Tis is a great film vehicle for Jim Carrey and a nice little film to boot. Sure it isn't very original, but the special effects help compliment the story and the leads are well cast. Jim Carrey is terrific in 2 roles as the Mask and Stanley Ipkiss.

Jim Carrey at his best.,"never thought it could happen. Jim Carrey (star of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective) upstaged -- and not once, but twice! While it's true that The Mask is another vehicle for the rubber-featured modern-day amalgamation of Jerry Lewis and the Three Stooges, this time around Carrey has some competition, and there are a number of scenes where he ends up playing second fiddle.The special effects are, for the most part, rather impressive, but they're as frequently guilty of overwhelming the star's performance as complimenting it. Nevertheless, if you think Carrey has an expressive face, wait 'til you see him with the mask on. Eyes pop out and jaws drop -- literally. ILM goes to work with their own version of live-action animation whenever anyone dons the mask. Good costumes and make-up serve only to enhance the computer-generated visuals.And, even as the audience's attention is arrested by the work of the effects wizards, there's still room for a canine scene-stealer. Milo (whose real name is Max) is the perfect foil for Carrey's goofiness and -- yes -- there are occasions where his animal antics divert the spotlight away from his two-legged co-star.Carrey, meanwhile, is playing a split role: mild-mannered Stanley Ipkiss and his superhuman alter-ego, the Mask. Stanley is a shy, unassuming man who works in a bank and lives with Milo in a small apartment. One day, following a terrible bout with Murphy's Law, Stanley finds a curious-looking mask floating amidst some debris in a river. Later, at home, when he finally gets around to trying the mask on, Stanley learns that this isn't some archaeological curiosity. It has power - the power to transform. From the moment the mask clings to his skin and his face turns green, Stanley's personality undergoes a radical shift. Insecurity is replaced by flamboyance. Physically, there seems to be little that he can't do, from twisting his body into a pretzel to taking a bullet in the chest or forming a tommy gun out of a balloon.While wearing the mask, Stanley makes a comment about becoming a superhero, but he's really interested in one thing: Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz), a voluptuous nightclub singer who works for a local gangster (Peter Greene). Following a bank robbery (to finance his wooing), the Mask discovers that a cop, Lt. Mitch Kellaway (Peter Riegert), is hot on his trail. And it's not that difficult a trail to follow. After all, how many lime-faced bandits are there who move like the Warner Brothers cartoon Tasmanian Devil? Carrey plays Stanley with surprising restraint, giving his zaniness free reign only when the mask is on. In some ways, it's a Clark Kent/Superman thing. Stanley and the Mask might share the same body, but they're very different. One is a typical nice guy who finishes last. The other is Robin Williams' genie from Aladdin come to life (Carrey provides dozens of whirlwind impersonations).As a comedy, The Mask is genial, but its recycled plot is far too thin for the film to succeed as either an adventure or a spoof. ""Comic book"" and ""cartoon"" are two terms that come to mind for describing this movie. Neither is intended to be pejorative, but each conjures certain apt images.Carrey is only in The Mask for 25-30 mins. I wanted to see more. But it's good to see his serious stuff as well.For me, Ace Ventura was too much concentrated Jim Carrey. In The Mask, the forceful personality is diluted. The star is mostly-subdued except during those off-the-wall bursts of energy that accompany the appearance of the Mask. The film is entertaining enough -- in a light, undemanding sort of way -- but more than the combined efforts of Carrey, ILM, and Max are demanded to camouflage the seams and holes still apparent in this production. No one else could have played the part better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Delightful Comedy,"I've seen this hilarious, inventive, fast, crazy, and delightful comedy many times and it never bores me. It makes my eyes pop up and my jaw drop down not unlike Jim Carrey's Mask persona in one of the film's many incredible scenes. This is the perfect movie for Jim Carrey's talents in physical comedy. He sure had a lot of fun and improvised in many scenes doing the parodies and paying the homage to the famous movies and characters in recognizable and hilarious way. The movie made me laugh all the time; it is a perfect fun for the whole family which does not happen too often. All supporting players made the film even more enjoyable but one actor who did impossible and almost stole the central spot from Carrey was the dog, the Jack Russell Milo. What a great performance! If they ever gave the Oscars for the best animal performance, Milo would be the one to receive it. The Mask also marked the film debut for an ex- model, 22 years old Cameron Diaz, and I believe that it was one of the most stunning debuts ever. The moment, she stepped in Stanley Ipcus's (Jim Carrey) bank and his life, the new star was born. I've never seen her as beautiful as in her first movie, and her dance with Carrey at the night club has proved that she could keep up with the most amazing physical comedian of our time. Great fun. Oh yes - how could I forget the Oscar nominated special effects that made Carrey's transformations from a shy clerk to a superhero absolutely amazing. I think that this comedy is timeless and it would delight the viewers of all ages for many years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Stupid and ridiculous.,"I can't imagine how can so many people watch this movie. Honestly, there are a lot of better comedy movies out there that make you think twice before watching this. I read in a lot of papers that this movie was a piece of garbage, so I didn't watch it in the cinema, but I've watched it today in a friend's pad because there was nothing else to do.Yeah, this movie is a waste of time. Not that it's as bad as the papers said but with so many better movies out there why would you watch this one? I mean... it's not funny, the special effects are a pain in the a** and the story, like in all other comedies of the 90's is garbage.The Mask's facial expressions are too artificial and his jokes are old and unoriginal. It's not violent like the comics and make the original Mask look like a goofy... probably because Jim Carrey casts him. Or maybe because his jokes are very, really childish.Hmmm... well, these are all my gripes. On the positive side, very, really few scenes are funny and the final scene was cool. But that's all. I guess that young children may find this movie funny anyway, so I give it a 4. See, I'm Bloody John but I'm generous!",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
P.R.A.T! Why??,"The Mask (1) (1994) -It was a shame that Stanley Ipkiss was played so over the top by Jim Carrey. Even before he found the ""Mask"" he was too loud and silly. That meant that the change that followed, as he metamorphosed in to his greener persona, had less impact.I mean I suppose that he is very talented in the way that he can swap and change his voice and behaviour so easily, in a similar way to the legendary Robin Williams, but Rob knew how to balance it better.And actually this seemed to be the MOST Jim Carrey film of all films. It was as if he had been asked to write a script that best represented his comedy style and was let loose.Some of it did work - Mostly the parts when he was 'The Mask', because the character was deliberately supposed to be outrageous and cartoon like and I did think that it might have come across better in a cartoon format. The special effects would have been rendered more easily and Jim's larger than life presence would have fit the style more.The catchphrases were funny at the time this film was released and I remember spouting them for months and possibly years afterwards, but they have really become very tired now, unless you're ""Smokin'"" or having a ""P. A. R. T. Why? Because ya gotta!"".In fact the whole thing seemed a bit dated, watching it nearly 30 years later and I felt that it had probably gone out of date not that long after it's release, because it really was an older type of production, rivalling films like those of the 'Batman' franchise (1989-97) and many others that had the sense to remain in the 1980's, for their cheese and zany humour.As a whole it did what you might expect a film of this type to do and it may still entertain some younger audiences, although there were moments that were not necessarily appropriate for kids too, so it would be a fine balance as to whom it might appeal to most.Perhaps if it was remade it could receive a treatment closer to that of 'Deadpool' (2016) and 'Kick-Ass' (2010), firmly aimed at a more mature group that already know all the swear words and enjoy comedic violence. Maybe the producers just didn't know how to make this one for kids, whilst still bringing the slapstick beatings to a live action film that included deadly outcomes at times and featured a lot of guns.In summary I would say that it hadn't aged brilliantly, but the 'Cuban Pete' scene and a couple of others could still be recognised as done well.If you're not a fan of Jim I wouldn't touch it at all, not even if you're obsessed with Cameron Diaz, who played Tina, because it wasn't her best role either, but it might entertain the eleven/twelve year olds on a wet Saturday?610.92/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Classic Jim Carrey,"I am giving this movie a rate of 7 stars mostly because it was a fine childhood movie, that reminds me happy moments.This is a movie with realistic scenarios, about the ordinary guy, who works from 9 to 5, being very loaded and not impulsive while the ugly criminal hold the power.With the magic of The Mask then he becomes the person he feels to be.Story is lovable, romantic and comic as Jim Carrey should be.Visual effects and costume were amazing for that time of the year. Some scenes were well made using visual effects, and the overall of costume and production designs were stunning. You could get the feeling of Los Angeles as for ""Edge City"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A fun filled ride,"The Mask is a superhero comedy movie starring Jim Carey, Peter Greene, Peter Reigert, Jim Doughan and Cameron Diaz in her debut movie. The movie is directed by Chuck Russell.The movie is nice and entertaining with superb comic timing by Jim Carrey, Jim Doughan also impressed with his good comedy. Cameron Diaz is looking stunningly beautiful.Direction and screenplay is good and will keep you engaged and your bone tickling with the comic timing. Background music is good but gets loud at some places.A nice comedy movie with superb acting by Jim Carrey.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Carrey is Phenomenal and the Rest of the Movie Holds Up Pretty Well,"Most of the characters in the Mask present themselves as stereotypes or stock characters but they evolve as the movie goes on. Stanley is very much the likeable shmuck, Tina is femme fatale, Charlie is the token sidekick, Kellaway is the angry cop and Milo is the comedic relief in a cute and fuzzy package. But to the film's credit, as we get further into the story, things start to change. Ipkiss is secretly super goofy and hopelessly romantic, Tina's not just with Dorian for the money, there's more to Peggy than meets the eye and Dorian's darkness is deeper than the surface level. I wouldn't claim it's a master class in character development but it's a surprise card the movie has up its sleeve. You might find yourself getting more attached than you might think, at least compared to most comedies you watch today.My comments about Carrey's performance in this may come across as hyperbolic or even unrealistic but even revisiting this today, this is a transcendent acting job. He's so perfectly cast as Stanley Ipkiss, he's not only believable and sympathetic as the repressed and downtrodden everyman but the movie pulses with comedic adrenaline every time Stanley puts on the Mask. Jim's fantastic in every sense of the word, his style meshes perfectly with the CGI and watching him do his bits with the Mask was like watching Carlos Santana play a guitar or Tom Brady throw a football. To have anyone one else playing this character would have been a great disservice to the movie. Cameron Diaz got her start here and while she's gorgeous, watching it again, I was taken aback that she did great work in this. She's not given Oscar calibre material but her talent and acting ability does shine through here. This isn't just a Jessica Alba in Sin City or Megan Fox in Transformers where her sex appeal does all the work, she does a good job being vulnerable and she has good chemistry with Carrey. Peter Riegert doesn't get enough credit for his turn as Detective Kellaway. He's really funny and with him going from serious cop to buffoon in one minute to the next, he doesn't miss a beat. Peter Greene is menacing as Dorian without being too scary or dark, he also gets a couple of chances to be funny and he's surprisingly good. Green accomplishes what this movie needs him to and I can't fault him for that. Amy Yasbeck is fun as Peggy; they pull a nice switch with her character that makes the film a little more unpredictable. Richard Jeni is also decent as Stanley's friend Charlie; he doesn't get much to do but he fills his role. I'm not the only one to point this out but if there's a most underrated member of the cast, pay attention for Anne Fletcher as the singing cop in the Cuban Pete musical number, she's only on screen for a couple of minutes but she's really memorable in such a small part. I tip my hat to her and it's the kind of thing you rediscover years later watching this again.In a surprise to everyone, one of the aspects that should be praised with The Mask is the set dressing, costuming and score. I'll start with the score which is as smooth as H$!!, the musical numbers are fantastic for a movie that's not a musical in the classic sense but even the music playing over other scenes sounds fantastic. The Cuban Pete number, might be the best scene in the movie, it gives Carrey room to strut his stuff, its offbeat and disarming and its really funny in the context of the story. There's a pseudo swing vibe to the rest of the movie that makes it stand out from the pack and the instrumental work really helps you meet the movie on its level. I don't put an emphasis on costuming normally, I'm more concerned with other things but whether it was in the comic and it was a good translation or they came up with that for the film, that yellow suit the Mask parades around in is iconic to me. Its so distinctive and I couldn't picture the character without it. Cameron Diaz also has some memorable outfits that really stood out to me after rewatching this again. Again, credit should be given where credit is due and despite it not being The Lord of the Rings or Guardians of the Galaxy, the extra work put in does transport you into this world.Despite the fact I watch this movie with rose coloured glasses, it isn't without flaws or problems. It does suffer from a tonal inconsistency, some scenes in the movie like when Niko is interrogating Dorien or eventually Niko's death are pretty dark while the rest of the movie is pretty light and breezy. It also is conversely a little too cartoonish (the movie's vibe, not Carrey's performance) in other moments. Even with the rules The Mask establishes for itself, it stretches plausibility in some scenes. I'm going to attribute that to the comic's material being much darker and them trying to translate it to the screen. I also have to point out that while it ages pretty well considering, if this movie were made today, Stanley's pursuit of Tina would be much creepier. It approaches that line once or twice but it pulls back enough to avoid most of the problematic material.I would never claim The Mask is perfect but I was so happy after finishing my viewing of it. So many movies I loved as a kid don't hold up, age well or have been deemed inappropriate due to shifting societal attitudes (Shanghai Noon or Rush Hour 2 come to mind). This movie is still a blast and unless you can't stand Jim Carrey or his antics, I can't imagine anyone not finding something they like in this film. I still love The Mast and despite the occasional misstep, I would put it on again without hesitating.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Inventive Production Design Saves An Otherwise Plain-Jane Script,"The animation behind all of the Mask's comedy is the main draw and every time he takes the mask off we are left bored if not anxiously awaiting his return. Mixing cartoon character physics in the real world but played straight, The Mask is an experiment in surreal comedic expression and the sardonic mocking of noir tropes with reckless abandon. It's a shame half the movie is unbearably stilted when the Mask is gone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Enjoyable for adults and fairly suited for kids,"A simple good/bad dichotomy and an emblematic romance is effectively elevated by the original cartoonish visual effects and up-and-coming star Jim Carrey's brilliant physical comedy in this now semi-cult-classic. Much of the build-up and realization of the basic premise, about a bashful man who discovers and then utilizes a magic Norse mask, is derived directly from traditional superhero territory, and so is the title character's two personas, but our masked hero has a spunky and sometimes deliciously absurd vibe to him that makes the film enjoyable for adults while at the same time being fairly suited for kids.

Jim Carrey's second headlining feature of 1994 is a comic book noir inspired love letter to Tex Avery with a balance of bouncy comedy and gritty edge.,"Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is good natured cartoon loving bank clerk at Edge City Savings who's a nice guy who is often mistreated or taken advantage by both colleagues and friends as well as Edge City's other citizens. Stanley has a chance encounter with Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz), a glamorous lounge singer who performs at the Coco Bongo nightclub. Unbeknownst to Stanley Tina is reluctantly working as a spotter for her jealous, abusive, and paranoid boyfriend Dorian Tyrell (Peter Green) a low level mobster in Edge City's criminal underworld with plans to take over from the current boss Niko (Orestes Matacena). During a night of humiliations while trying to attend the nightclub, Stanley's car breaks down on a bridge and sees an object floating in the bay. Upon investigation Stanley finds an old mask with a strange green coloring and after being drawn to put on the mask becomes a nigh invincible cartoon-esque wild man who acts out Stanley's repressed impulses on both those who wronged him but also gives him the charm and confidence to approach Tina much to Dorian's anger. As Stanley's alter ego known as ""The Mask"" makes impressions across Edge City, police lieutenant Kellaway (Peter Riegert) begins suspecting Stanley.The Mask is an adaptation of the Dark Horse Comic Book series of the same name created by Doug Mahnke and John Arcudi. The property was acquired for development by New Line in 1989 after being approached by Dark Horse with New Line seeing The Mask as a potential successor horror series to their legacied Nightmare on Elm Street series which by that point had started to see diminishing returns with Elm Street 5. Initially work on the project was slanted in a horror direction, but when Chuck Russell who directed what's regarded as the best Elm Street sequel, Dream Warriors, became attached Russell was put off by the violence in the comic book and sought to make something lighter with crossover appeal to both kids and adults. At the suggestion of New Line Executive Mike DeLuca, Jim Carrey was cast as the lead, and model Cameron Diaz after much coaxing accepted the role of Tina. Previous Carrey vehicle, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, had released earlier in February 1994 to solid success at the box office and Carrey was at the forefront of the marketing campaign when the movie released in July of that year to massive success making $300 million worldwide against its $18-23 million budget and cemented Carrey as a bankable A-lister with Dumb and Dumber's success in December basically a foregone conclusion. The movie remains a solid high concept comedy, but with a story that has more than a few allusions to The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and a comic book noir approach to the material, The Mask has seen itself as a source of inspiration for other similar films.Jim Carrey does quite well playing both Stanley Ipkiss and The Mask with Ipkiss serving as a showcase of Carrey's more down to earth charms outside of his more exaggerated Ace Ventura mannerisms, while The Mask showcases Carrey's rapid fire delivery and ability to become as close an approximation to a living cartoon as one can be. The duality between the meek good natured Stanley Ipkiss and the manic wisecracking Bugs Bunny esque havoc of The Mask are wonderfully balanced and it's because of Carrey's ability and strength with both personas that the movie works as well as it does. With a lesser actor this role would not have worked and one of the actors considered, Matthew Broderick, went on to do his own The Mask inspired film with Disney's ill-fated adaptation of Inspector Gadget which tried to be a live-action cartoon but without the same level of weight giving to the performance and filmmaking. The visual effects used to bring The Mask to life are terrific and still hold up with their rubbery elastic nature in conjunction with Carrey's naturally expressive and versatile face giving us cartoon shenanigans in a real world setting. Cameron Diaz is wonderful in her debut role as Tina Carlyle and shows real screen presence and sweetness in her performance as well as great chemistry with Carrey, while it'd be unthinkable to find a real life counterpart to Jessica Rabbit from Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Diaz comes about as close as you can get within the bounds of reality.The Mask is not only a groundbreaking achievement in special effects, but a solid showcase for Carrey's versatility as an actor and a wonderful debut for Cameron Diaz. With fantastic comedy and great chemistry between the leads you can see the influence The Mask has had on similar movies that followed including the Deadpool movies and (to a degree) even the Venom movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Very funny and enjoyable!,"Not gonna lie. When I first heard of this film, I thought it looked stupid and ridiculous. Although I usually like Jim Carrey roles, it just didn't seem very enjoyable to me. Then I saw it, and I take back everything negative about it. Not only is it hilarious and awesome, but its one of my favorite Jim Carrey roles ever!Jim Carrey stars as banker Stanley Ipkiss, who finds a mysterious mask, that when put on turns him into a cartoony, green faced maniac who causes all sorts of mischief. This gets him into some trouble with not only the police, but a gang of mobsters.Funny and entertaining from start to finish. Of course it is Jim Carrey, so that is expected. He has two roles in here: One where he's normal, and then when he has the mask on. Both roles are funny. Cameron Diaz's introducing role as the target of Jim Carrey's affections, who also get involved in a lot of his mischief.Basic comedy with all standard comedy ingredients. Very laugh out loud funny.

Carrey As A Green-Faced Hero Burning Down The House,"I get to revisit one of my all-time favourite comedies 'The Mask' after getting the DVD. This, and 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' are considered Carrey's Hollywood breakthrough and of course I couldn't think of a better way to introduce one of America's funniest leading men. 'The Mask' is sheer fun and energy, from start to finish. I also liked the story which is pretty simplistic but engaging and the special effects are amazing. Chuck Russell has done a fantastic job in keeping it all together. Jim Carrey sort of has a double role. He is brilliantly restrained as the docile pushover Stanley Ipkiss and amusingly wacky as The Mask. Moreover Carrey also has a flair for singing and his 'Cuban Pete' is a terrific catchy number. Cameron Diaz oozes sensuality and excellently carries off Tina Carlyle. There is an amazing chemistry between her and Carrey. The supporting cast is very good and special mention goes to Max the dog who is such a joy to watch.

"Movie Schitzo's Review of ""The Mask""","Jim Carrey is one my favorite actors of all time. He is great and very funny and has made a lot of great films and career choices. One of them was The Mask. It is one of the movies that got Carrey started in the acting business. The plot is simple and outlandish. Stanley Ipkiss is a too nice pushover bank clerk in Edge City. After one of the worst days of his life he comes across a mysterious mask, owned by Loki, the God of Mischief. So now when he puts on the mask, he becomes a crazy romantic. When he starts to fall for the girlfriend of the local mob boss (Cameron Diaz, in one of her first roles). The mob finds out about the ancient mask and are out to find it. The group, which is led by Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene). So Stanley has to save the day and get the girl. The acting and visual effect are all very well done and probably some of the greatest at the time. Jim Carrey heads the movie very well with supporting help from Cameron Diaz and Amy Yasbeck. All in all, a great comedic classic that should go down into visual effects history.3 out of 4 stars",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The ONLY Mask,"This is one of those movies that I grew up with and just loved. Cameron Diaz in that red dress? One of my first Hollywood crushes, for sure. Jim Carrey basically just playing a cartoon character, which isn't much of a reach for him and its amazing. I remember quoting it a ton, and so much of it is designed to be quoted. That said, I was kinda nervous to watch this again. There's that small twinge of 'fear' going back to a childhood favorite and knowing that it might not hold up, that modern and adult sensibilities might judge harsher than the childhood wonderment could.Happy to say I still love this movie. Once again, I think it's a case of movies from back then just being willing to go dark for a younger audience. I mean, its really cartoony but there's condom jokes, HEAVY sexuality and a lot about the nature of id and ego, about being yourself and not letting social pressures and anxieties stop you from being you. Carrey's rubber face antics are just perfect for this character though, it really feels like a role that was designed with him in mind and I struggle to think of anyone else that could pull it off. Probably no better evidence of that than the sequel we try to forget.There's some heavy nostalgia here, but I really think this is a fun time and worth checking out again. Not sure how fresh eyes would take this, but if you watched and loved it in your youth, this is absolutely worth revisiting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Amusing,"The mask is an interesting film. It starts of slow introducing the characters and there personalities. It starts to pick up pace when Stanley gets possession of the mysterious 'mask'. Although it takes a while for Stanley to get hold of the mask the build up to it is quite impressive and sets the scene quite well. All sort of antics go on with the mask, and quite a few of them made me laugh. I have to applaud the creativity of the writers. The villains of the story are unoriginal but there are still a few good twist involving them here and there. Overall, it is a unique, funny movie which set the scene well and had lots of creativity. It lacked in character depth, good villains and a more interesting goal of the villain. I guess overall it is intended to be more of a comedy than a thriller but my point still stands. I recommend this movie if you are in a bad mood and want to get cheered up or you just want to see a classic funny movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Perfect summer comedy,"The Mask was a perfect vehicle for Jim Carrey. It not only allowed provided the perfect justification to flamboyantly engage in his rubber-faced antics in a manner even more over-the-top than what he'd become famous for, but it provided an opportunity to stretch his acting chops towards a more serious side at just the right time in his career, paving the way for later work such as Man on the Moon (1999), The Majestic (2001) and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004).The success of the film wholly depends on Carrey, as he has to sell his characters' frenzied insanity so that it's believable as a reflection of Stanley's inner self while at the same time likable but teetering on the edge of becoming obnoxiously overbearing. Of course, the amazing special effects and make-up help, as well as the clever script and more than competent directing and cinematography, but with the wrong actor in the part, the whole affair could have easily collapsed. The other cast members are fine in supporting roles, with Cameron Diaz coming across as being almost otherworldly beautiful, but Carrey is rarely off-screen, and rightly so.The Mask is notable for both spoofing almost the whole history of cinema while at the same time respectfully paying homage to it. The audience is treated to everything from silent film slapstick to lavish musical numbers (with excellent songs), frenzied Tex Avery-styled animation to gangster film suspense. On its surface, the film is a crazy, often funny, hyperactively paced cinematic pastiche.The subtext about identity and public faces versus private selves is interesting, but not the focus. It would be fine to explore further, but to do so in this particular film would have taken too much time away from Carrey's surrealistic tour de force. Besides, we've had later films where that subtext has been closer to the heart of a story, such as Catwoman (2004), and where it was very thoroughly and competently dealt with.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

The Mask - When the Joker Meets Tex Avery and It Ends in a Neon Carnival,"By 1994, Jim Carrey wasn't playing characters anymore-he was the living embodiment of Tex Avery's cartoons. His performance is electric, over-the-top, and veers between hilarious, like a classic Guignols de l'info sketch, and exhausting, like your drunk uncle stealing the mic at a wedding. You'll want to applaud him and beg him to stop pulling faces all at once.Cameron Diaz, in her cinematic debut, instantly became a global fantasy. With her red dress and a smile that could melt glaciers, she lights up the screen but is sadly treated like a background character in GTA. She's beautiful, she's there, but she exists mainly to give the hero something to chase. She's the Princess Peach of this movie, except instead of Mario, you've got Jim Carrey bouncing off the walls and screaming.This could've been a prelude to The Joker. Stanley Ipkiss, a spineless, downtrodden loser, finds a mask that unleashes his buried fantasies. But instead of diving into the complex psyche of a frustrated man embracing chaos, the film throws out fart noises and mambo dances. It's great if you're 10, but if you were hoping for something with a dark undercurrent, you boarded the wrong train.Peter Greene plays Dorian, a gangster so over-the-top he feels ripped from an '80s B-movie. His grand plan? Put on the mask and become an even more ridiculous villain. The result? A mash-up of the Hulk and a cartoon mobster. You'll chuckle, but you'll never feel threatened, which kills any tension. Honestly, even Scooby-Doo villains have more bite.Let's be real: you're here for two iconic scenes-the dance-off at the club and the mambo standoff with the cops. These moments are still fun, even after all these years. But between those highlights, you're stuck with gags fit for a first-grader-fart jokes, exaggerated grimaces, and slapstick galore. The movie tries to honor Tex Avery's genius, but instead of his brilliance, we get the hyperactive giggles of a sugar-rushed kid.The Mask is a visual fever dream that's pure magic if you're 10 but a bit of a chore if you're 30. Carrey delivers an iconic performance, but the film lacks the guts to dig deeper and instead settles for wacky burlesque. Is it a popcorn classic? Absolutely. A masterpiece? Not even close.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Irreverent fun!,"If anything, ""The Mask"" could best be described as a cartoon for adults. Yes, it's a live-action film, but there's enough animation to sufficiently blur the lines between animation and live action, and the film's spirit is pure cartoonish.Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a mild-mannered bank accountant manager who's always treated like doormat, even by his friend Charlie (Richard Jeni). One night, Stanley finds a mysterious mask which when put on, unleashes his complete alter-ego, known simply as ""The Mask."" But the mask is not bound by laws (legal or otherwise, which gets Stanley into trouble, both with the law (represented by the cynical Kellaway (Peter Riegert)) and the mob (Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene)).This film is all about Carrey. While his first major foray into film, ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,"" allowed him to perform his antics, ""The Mask"" is a better vehicle. This is because it allows computer animation to supplement Carrey's abilities. Plus, ""The Mask"" allows Carrey more creativity.Fortunately, Carrey is up to the task. Like Robin Williams, he's skilled at impersonation and animated personalities. Carrey has great fun lampooning everything to circus sideshows to the Oscars. But Carey spends only about half the movie (at most) as The Mask. As Ipkiss, he's more subdued and meek. But Carrey is equally adept at portraying someone like Ipkiss. It is Carrey's versatile skill that lets ""The Mask"" be a caricature, while Ipkiss be very real.Carrey's co-stars are great as well. This represented Cameron Diaz's film debut, and it kicked off her career with a great start as the knockout club singer, Tina Carlyle (doesn't the name just SOUND beautiful?). There are few actresses with more screen appeal than Diaz, and ""The Mask"" makes as much out of it as possible. The other female, Amy Yasbeck is frumpier, but appealing as well. Despite Diaz having a huge aptitude for comedy, she isn't given much of a chance to use it here; Yasbeck is. Yasbeck has a great sense of comic timing.Carrey's male co-stars are more varied, albeit slightly. Peter Riegert is terrific as The Mask's nemesis, Detective Kellaway. It's a familiar part in this sort of movie, the no-nonsense cop with no sense of humor. But Riegert has a few advantages: first, the law is REALLY on his side, and his banter with his dimwit partner Detective Doyle (Jim Doughan) represent some of the comic highlights. The late Richard Jeni shines as Ipkiss's friend and co-worker, Charlie. While Jeni doesn't steal any scenes (he's almost always paired with Carrey),y he has his shares of funny lines, all of which are delivered aplomb. As the villain Dorian Tyrell, Peter Greene is adequate, but not especially memorable. He's not even the best villain in the movie. That honor goes to Ricardo Matecena. He's only in two scenes, but he's noticeably more menacing than Greene, especially in his first scene.""The Mask"" represents director Chuck Russell's most memorable hit. This is because while he has a knack for visuals, his direction in other respects is bland. He works best when he makes scenes as set-pieces. Two of the best examples are the musical numbers, the first being a surprise dance number of ""Hey, Pachuco!"" with The Mask and Tina, and the second is a rendition of ""Cuban Pete"" between The Mask and the Police Department. They're both energetic and fun.While ""The Mask"" may not be the pinnacle of the genre, it's definitely worth a watch. Though I never saw it in theaters, I'm guessing it works better on video than it did in the theater.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A loser and everyone takes advantage of him. Stanley meets Tina (Cameron Diaz) the girlfriend of gangster Dorian Tyrell. She has come over to check the layout of the bank as Dorian plans to rob it.One evening Stanley finds a strange wooden mask by the river. It gives the wearer strange powers and a loud personality.

He even robs the bank before Dorian's goons.Now everyone is after the Mask including the police.Both Diaz and Carrey are great at the roles. The special effects really were something at the time.

Smokin'!,"This movie is a riot! Jim Carrey is at probably his best as Stanley Ipkiss/The Mask as he not only plays a relatable and sympathetic hero, he also plays an incredible comic relief character!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The technical aspects hold up really well-the comedy is pretty good too.,I saw this back in 1994; it is a fun film that is one of the better zany Carrey comedies. If you like Carrey's sense of humor-I generally do!-you should find this funny enough. There's not much that has dated badly in terms of the comedy. The story is overly cluttered and convoluted. There's a stronger plotline involving Ipkiss just handing out just desserts to people that is hinted at in the film. The gangster (sub)plot is unneeded and not all that compelling or funny. But Carrey is manic enough to have most of the gags land.With that said when I re-watched this today-in 2021-I was surprised by how well the CGI and other effects have held up. They look better-as in they convey the idea the film is going for-than a *ton* of CGI from the same time period-including Forest Gump (which won the Oscar). Some of this is that film is not intending the CGI to be 100% photoreal as it is aiming for cartoony images. But it is also the technicians' skills and some happy accidents. I suspect the mask's color-a shocking green-made the effects easier to work with. I found the effects compelling in their own right. If nothing else this is a good film to look at.,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A lot of fun...but exhausting,"Nerdy bank clerk Jim Carrey (playing Stanley Ipkiss, perhaps in a nod to ""The Ipcress File"") runs afoul of gangsters; luckily, he has recently acquired an ancient mask which, when worn, turns him into a whirling dervish of a super-hero. Live-action cartoon is best left to younger audiences, with unsubtle humor, formulaic plotting, and in-your-face mugging from Carrey, who busts many moves for the length of the picture. Carrey is actually fairly agreeable here, particularly as clerk Stanley, and he's paired wonderfully with saucy Cameron Diaz, making her debut as a torchy gangster's girl. The special effects are initially quite colorful, but they wear out their welcome, as does this exceptionally slim plot. Followed by a Carrey/Diaz-less sequel and an animated TV series. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Mask,I liked the movie back than and it is still funny...,8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Comedy Classic.,"This film has typically gone underrated. This is Jim Carrey's introduction to the major international public, and just like every other film he'd star in, he steals the show. As I ask in almost all my Carrey-starring movie reviews: could this film have even existed, or been efficient at any level, with ANYONE ELSE but Jim Carrey ? This guy is like Michael Jordan for a basketball team. You may have mediocre coaching, game-plan or even other players, but with very little and him on your squad, you can still achieve greatness or at very least glimpses of it. People forget that underneath the graphical effects, there's Jim Carrey. He's the Mask more than CGI or costumes. The film is funny, fun, entertaining if you'll only go into it with the according mindset. It's a nice tribute to the Tex Avery's and old school cartoonish classics, and a wacky, wacky premise to even begin with. It's also got a bit of morality: we all wear masks; and also the Mask itself is only power, it is the one who wears it who determines if he transforms into a positive weirdo, or a monster. Well written, fun watch. A classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Jim Carrey And Not Much Else,"Jim Carrey is - as always - excellent in this movie that features little else to commend itself to viewers. Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss, a shy and awkward bank employee whose life is changed when he finds and dons a mysterious mask that brings out all of his innermost feelings and desires. In short, he becomes everything he wishes he was - and finds that he's better off as who he is. Perhaps a good lesson in life for all those who wish their lives were different. But this movie didn't go for any serious message. It went for laughs, and in doing so featured - at best - sophomoric humour (which is sometimes hilarious and sometimes painfully bad.) Combined with lacklustre performances from the rest of the cast, what emerged was a mediocre film which broadly resembles a big cartoon.I watched this movie with my 8 year old niece. She thought it was great. That should tell you something right there. This is definitely a movie for the younger set. If you don't have an 8 year old to watch it with, I frankly wouldn't bother.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"""No, I don't smoke, but for you? I'd shoot the Surgeon General!""","I have a feeling 'The Mask' was based on a comic book, but I haven't read it! Therefore, I can't really say how well it's transferred across to the big screen. Although I can say that it works. Carrey plays a – depressingly average – guy who's too nice for his own good. Everyone takes advantage of him and his life is pretty awful. Naturally, when he finds a mysterious wooden mask that when worn transforms him into a green-faced superhero, he chooses to fight crime, protect the weak and generally stand up for justice. Or rather he kind of considers all those options. He mainly just uses his new powers to get back at all those people who have wronged him and do his best to woo the – then unknown – Cameron Diaz. Yeah, the story is hardly original and, if you've seen any of Marvel's latest offerings, it's pretty much identical to every other superhero film, i.e. man gets superpowers, man fights crime, defeats villain and gets girl. But, don't let any small lack of originality put you off. It's not there to be a great work of art with deep and meaningful prose and character arcs. It's there to entertain, utilizing Carrey's full repartee to the max.I really liked this film, as I think it shows off splendidly the comedic talent of Jim Carrey at his best. This film is the perfect production for him to unleash his unique brand of comedy whether it is over the top, or damped down for a specific scene. Normally, the best films are 'team efforts' when the cast all play their parts. Not here. Here it's just Carrey, Carrey, Carrey. He steals every scene and created a thousand new catch phrases in the process. This film is a lot of fun, and director Chuck Russell does a real nice job of crafting a true to life Tex Avery cartoon that lovers of the older short cartoons will truly enjoy and ever since it was originally released in the cinema again I really loved this film and is a really true tour-de-force comedy classic and shows off the actors at their best. The soundtrack - what can I say! Jazz and swing, and the whole art decor feel of places like the Coco Bongo night club - it's just got a whole 1920's, yet modern, feel to it - it's very aesthetically pleasing. Feast on a comic book creation being transferred onto the big screen in an all time ""Carrey classic"", this film will definitely bring out your childish side.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
JWB's Mask Review,"Ahh The Mask... One of my favorite movies from my childhood along with Jurassic Park... I use to own this movie on VHS but now I own it on Blu-Ray... But It has a very interesting history, Back in the 80's The Mask was nothing more then a Twisted Horror Comic published by Dark Horse Comics (No surprise really Dark Horse are always publishing some Dark stuff, But they have done some good stories like Aliens Vs Predator, Indiana Jones, Star Wars and some James Bond comics, But these days they've been publishing some Interesting stuff lie Anime and Manga based comics, Isn't that right, Mark Crilley? the man who did Brody's Ghost.) But then New Line Cinema brought the rights to the comic to make a series of films, in order to recreate the success of the Nightmare On Elm Street franchise the same horror franchise that put New Line on the map... Thank You Freddy Krueger for making this possible. Freddy Krueger: It's no problem Mr Barker, I also advised New Line to let Warner Bros. Entertainment by New Line to save us from bankruptcy... How ever When WB did a Remake of My movie, It didn't go the way they wanted.JWB: I'll be sure to check it out along with your film series and Freddy vs. Jason, Back then when people first heard they where making a movie of this Green Face, Some of them where like ""There is no way this is ever gonna work!"" Not only was the old comics Demented, Cruel and sick, But the Comic Book movie of the mid 90s where really crap at the time, Like Spawn, Batman & Robin, STEEL and Tank Girls, But when this movie was finally released, People where very very VERY surprised that Not only did the Movie barely resemble the comic but it was damn good for a change making it one of them weird rare exceptions of a movie adaptations the doesn't follow the original source material and is better for it Which explains why there are movies out there that are deviating from the original source material, Reasons why they did this change is to make it more appealing to everyone.I've watched this movie in the past and to this day, And clips of it in a Mexican hang out called the Coco Bongo like in the movie... hmm guess I now know where that idea came from. I really like this movie, Sure the effects might be cheesy a bit, But that is was makes this movie stand out among the bad ones in the past... Jim Carrey is perfect in this movie yeah he did Ace Ventura and he was The Riddler from Batman Forever...But the lest I hear about it's stand-Alone Sequel Son of the Mask, the better, For it was already covered by the Blockbuster Buster and the Nostalgia Critic with very questionable results... A big Horrific Let down to the Mask Franchise, If someone tries to do another sequel... Please let it be a Direct and proper sequel to the first Mask movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
As funny as the Hulk movies!,"Yes. 8 or 11 years old me liked it (I don't remember loving it, even then). But my God this movie is bad. As a non Jim Carrey fan (he has a couple of actual good movies like Eternal Sunshine and Truman Show; actual comedies like Liar Liar and Dumb and Dumber; and awful disasters at comedy like Ace Ventura and Cable guy and at actual movies like Yes Man and Incredible Burt Wonderstone), I find him appealing when surrounded by a structure and story but not when he's just doing dumb faces and sounds with nothing else to support it.And this is just that. Jim Carrey doing Jim Carrey stupidity for no reason without reason and Cameron Diaz being the definition of pretty.Without any enhancing substance, this movie is nothing more than an annoying mess.It's only a two because it does have some fine set pieces in terms of production values.",2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Like Looney Tunes Cartoons Brought To Life,"When you get someone like Jim Carey it's often hard to find a vehicle that's suited to their talents. No such problem here, with the manic, hyper energetic comedian fitting the role with utter ease. It was as if the whole idea was written with him in mind.Actually it's more likely that someone sat down one day & decided to see just how far they could push the new digital special effects of the day. Whatever, the results are pure lunacy.Carey, as mild mannered, down trodden Stanley Ipkiss is a bubbling pot of seething desires & emotions ready to boil over but forever with the lid firmly clamped down. He plays the part supremely, not overly sentimental (something of an achievement in today's Hollywood!) & always giving an air of the raging spirit within that is just itching to get out. It's like watching someone walk a tightrope.Jim Carey as The Mask is something of a whirlwind, quite literally. Who can forget the two stand out lines when the Mask takes over; ""Somebody stop me!"" & ""Smokin'!"". These two lines sum the character up in a marvelous way.His dog, Milo, is also well done. How on earth some Hollywood exec didn't insist that it become some sentimental pooch I'll never know. Yes it is far too intelligent, far too useful, far too convenient, but it is excusable in the context of the film.The marginal story line about gansters, a bank heist & so on is merely a framework for Carey as the Mask to perform increasingly manic acrobatics on the screen. The references to cartoons, especially Wiley Coyote & Road Runner (perhaps the best, most imaginative cartoons ever made) are obvious. There is even a direct steal from a Bugs Bunny cartoon where it appears that the audience has stood up in front of you to applaud a performance as Carey gets handed an Oscar.The cops & the villains are all about as dumb as each other, which is the reasons why they're there. Carey as the Mask is the focus of all this, after all. Peter Riegert as Lt Kellaway & Peter Greene as the villanous Dorian Tyrell do the job well though & Tyrell even gets a shot at wearing the Mask with somewhat muted results. Let's face it, nothing compares to Carey's version.The pace wanes a little towards the end, but still contains an interesting twist, where the love lorn Carey discovers the truth about Amy Yasbeck's reporter & Cameron's Diaz's night club singer. It is  not what you'd expect. There are also some surprisingly good musical numbers, I bet that took some explaining in the studio board meetings!All in all a good laugh & the mark of this film is that several years later, after watching at least 3 times since release, a recent TV showing still made me laugh again.There'll never be another, perhaps that's as well as I doubt that the material would be so forthcoming, although it's a shame there won't be another helping of The Mask.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

My Favorite Jim Carrey Movie of All Time,"Jim Carrey is a really funny comedian, and this is my favorite movie that he stars in. The Mask is a classic comedy and for 25 years old, it still looks really good to this very day.The movie is about an average guy, Stanley Ipkiss (played by Jim Carrey) and he is living a mediocre life as a banker and being swept under the rug. One night, he comes across a legendary mask that, when he puts on, turns him into a full blown crazy and wacky guy. Stanley uses these powers to hit on a hot chick, Tina (played by Cameron Diaz) and to stop this mob group from robbing and later wanting to kill Tina.Everything about this movie was fantastic. The dialogue and quotes from Carrey were funny and clever, the special effects were impressive for 1994, and pacing was fast and great.Also, this is Cameron Diaz's first movie, and I gotta say, she did a wonderful job as playing the love interest. Her character was likable, sweet, and there was great chemistry with her and Carrey on screen.Overall, I love The Mask. It's Jim Carrey at his best because he gets to have superpowers and be funnier than ever.This movie is WAY WAY better than that terrible sequel known as ""Son of the Mask"" which is one of the worst sequels ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Not The Same When I Was Watching It As A Kid....,"The Bad= First of off I didn't realize this when I was watching when I was a kid. But these days I find it sick and disgusting, how they literally Sexualize Camron Diaz in her first scene. And in her First Movie Role no less. And at curtain instances this continues through out the film. And remember this Film was Targeted at a Younger Audience.Anyways moving on then next is to my understanding this film was significantly changed from the original source material. As the original source material is much darker, again as I understand it. In my opinion they could have just tuned down the darkness to the level of the Batman 89 or at the very least to the level of Batman Returns. Those two films just shows you that just because it's a Comic Book Movie doesn't mean that it always has to be campy not even back then, in particular if the original source material is kind of dark. Not every Comic Book Movie has to be Bright And Colourful and Campy it all depends on the original source material.Anyways moving on yet again I think with it literally being a Live Action Cartoon didn't do anything for me. As I feel that the Mandan Day Life of the City was way too Boring when I was watching it, and it just feels more so now. And as for the Fun Night Scenes was as I have said Cartoony. Oh sure I loved those scenes when I was a kid but I didn't know any better and besides Live Action Cartoon. And speaking of I just think even some of the Night Scenes was all that interesting as nothing in that scene was really eye popping. Such as the Park Scenes and the End Resolution Scene. And also speaking of if I didn't watch it when I was a kid I would have still see the Ending a mile away. I also feel that a lot of the Special Effects really did not aged well. It was fine when it first came out in my opinion but in 2022 it really did not aged really well. I feel that Jim Carrey was right for the part just because how Over The Top not only this movie was but also I feel that the Mask Character was Way Over The Top. Which is not really my thing any more. And I also feel that it's a Tad Bit Violent for the Targeted Audience in at least a couple of small scenes. But Fortunately it's not too bad but still it's something to watch out for when showing it to your kids. And unless I'm missing anything that should do it for the Negatives for now.The Good= The Movie and that Mask Character maybe Over The Top but when I was a kid I found that Entertaining. In fact I used to go around and repeat some of his Catch Phrases with ""Sssssmoken"" being the most used one. However I do admit I really like both the Metaphor and the Line of this movie of ""We All Wear Masks"" because in a way it is true. But don't worry all of my Reviews are Legit Up and Up from the Heart and Mind. What you read in my Reviews is all Hundred Percent Me. And I guess this is where you call BS on me I wouldn't blame you for doing it, but that still doesn't change the fact.... Anyways moving on the last Positive that I could give it is that this film does still make me crack a little bit of a smile in certain scenes only thou. So little in fact only a Mouse could get through, but hay at least that's something. And unless I'm missing anything else that should do it.Final Thoughts= I'm so glad that this film Launched both of Jim Carrey's and Camron Diaz's Careers Respectively. I really am. Even though the films that they have been are not really for me personally. Aside from Jim Carrey's version of the Disney's A Christmas Carol. Personally, And Sadly that's about it.",3.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Still great after all this time,"I haven't watched 'The Mask' for years and I was actually wondering how well it would stand up after over twenty years. Back in 1995 Jim Carrey was Hollywood's (comedy) golden child. Everything he touched was Box Office dynamite. However, since then, his offerings have been a little more hit and miss (don't get me started on 'Dumb and Dumber To!'), but I'm pleased to say that The Mask still shows off his manic persona and comedy timings.I have a feeling 'The Mask' was based on a comic book, but I haven't read it! Therefore, I can't really say how well it's transferred across to the big screen. Although I can say that it works. Carrey plays a – depressingly average – guy who's too nice for his own good.

Top-of-the-line comedy/drama/fantasy/thriller with Jim Carrey based on the Dark Horse comic book,"RELEASED IN 1994 and written & directed by Chuck Russell based on Mike Richardson's comic, ""The Mask"" stars Jim Carrey as a bank clerk who is an extraordinarily nice guy, but too much of a pushover when it comes to confrontations. He inadvertently finds a mask of Loki, the Norse night god of mischief and, when he puts it on, he becomes his true self, the person he is WITHIN: a cartoony romantic wild man. Peter Greene plays the head antagonist while Peter Riegert plays the police lieutenant who investigates the havoc in the wake of The Mask.Jim Carrey's breakout year was 1994 when his three hugely popular movies hit the theaters: ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,"" this one, and ""Dumb and Dumber."" The following year he appeared in ""Batman Forever"" and the sequel to ""Ace Ventura."" ""The Mask"" easily ranks with his best films. When I first saw this flick in the late 90s I didn't know anything about the Dark Horse comic, so when Carrey's character first puts the mask on I didn't know what to expect and so was thoroughly taken aback by the kinetic flurry of thrills and laughs.Cameron Diaz appears on the babe front and the film really highlights her winsome appeal and ravishing figure, not that I was ever enraptured by her (then again, I don't NOT like her either). The song & dance routine featuring The Mask & Tina (Diaz) at the Coco Bongo nightclub is knock-it-out-of-the-ballpark entertainment. Remember those great song & dance routines in Coppola's ""The Cotton Club"" (1984)? Parts of ""The Mask"" are like that, but with a silly, comedic and over-the-top dynamism. The stunning Amy Yasbeck also has a significant secondary role (be sure to watch the deleted scenes to discover what happens to her character; it's hilarious in a black humor way and should've never been cut from the movie).THE FILM RUNS 101 minutes and was shot in Los Angeles & San Pedro Bay, California.

"Brilliantly rubbery, creatively cartoony effects help tell a dark, surprisingly deep story.","'The Mask (1994)' has some surprisingly deep allegorical undertones and a nice message about being yourself, and your best self at that, to overcome the problems you previously thought someone in a mask would be better suited to solve. It also has a real underlying darkness, which shouldn't be shocking to anyone familiar with the much harsher and more cynical source material, which contrasts nicely with the cartoony powers possessed by the wearer of the eponymous facial facade. This is one of my favourite comedies because the humour comes from such an honest place, our hero first hiding his insecurities and then them being unceremoniously released in sometimes creepy ways, and the story itself works incredibly well without relying on its laughs as a crutch. It does all this while using its incredibly inventive and wonderfully realised rubbery, real-life toon aesthetic to brilliant effect.

Oh dear,"90's cliché comedy. I saw this when I was young and remember not laughing at all, I mean I was 12 and I was bored by it. We've been watching it on TV tonight hoping for some sarcastic giggles. Even from a sarcastic viewpoint this movie offers nothing. I'm embarrassed for Jim, somehow people think the Cable Guy is his worst movie, well they're dead wrong.

Classic Carrey,"Jim Carrey careens through The Mask like Gumby on coke, a hopped up ball of energy that lights the screen up in glorious craziness that's pretty out there even for him. In casting a character that basically becomes a loony toons character in real life, they hit the nail on the head with Carrey, and he delivers in a tour de force piece of physical comedy that put him on the map in a huge way. Also bursting onto the scene in her official breakout role is Diaz, playing the luscious Tina Carlyle, a sultry lounge singer. Carrey's eyeballs pop out and his tongue rolls onto the table when he sees her dance. Audiences had the same reaction, and her work here catapulted her into the stardom we see her in today. Carrey plays mild mannered bank clerk Stanley Ipkiss, a pitifully beta push over who's about as good at talking to girls as he is dealing with his domineering boss and witch of a landlady. He's a wimp, a thorough Nancy boy, a set up which makes the eventual metamorphosis into The Mask all the more delectable of a payoff. When he hits proverbial rock bottom, he finds an ancient looking Mask in the harbour, and takes it home. Upon putting it on, he transforms into a living, breathing representation of his innermost desires and feelings, bursting out in a deliriously zany, green faced maestro of mayhem that can pretty much do..anything. It's somewhat Freudian, and there's even an interlude with Ben Stein as a droll psychiatrist who ponders Ipkiss's sanity before booting him from his office. Carrey as The Mask is the star of the show, an ever wisecracking ball of slapstick glee and mirth, whirlwinding his way from one over the top encounter to the other, with his trusty dog Max. He's finally given the stones to take what he wants, albeit in violent, creepy and demented fashion, and pursue Tina, in between bank robberies, assaults, car chases and Cuban dance numbers involving a troupe of singing cops. On his tail is nasty crime lord Dorian Tyrell (the intimidating Peter Greene, having a ball) and a grouchy police detective (Peter Riegert). The film is pure 90's cheese given a shot of surreal antics. There's a whole army credited to the visual effects, and one can see why when you look at the splendour on display, rushing past at such speed and precision you'll need a re-watch just to catch it all.

The Mask: A Wild and Wacky Comedy That Never Loses Its Charm,"The Mask (1994), directed by Chuck Russell, is a laugh-out-loud comedy that combines over-the-top humor with groundbreaking visual effects.

The special effects, which were revolutionary for their time, bring the mask's cartoonish antics to life, creating a vibrant and visually unforgettable experience.The movie's blend of slapstick humor, comic-book elements, and a jazzy soundtrack make it a fun ride from start to finish.

This is comedic genre gold.,"The Mask (1994) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched with my daughter on Tubi. The storyline follows a modest banker who is looking to change his love and personal life and hits the lottery when he finds a mystical mask. The mask turns him into the person of his dreams, but it has side effects. Can the man contain the mask, or will it take him over?This movie is directed by Chuck Russell (A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors) and stars Jim Carey (Dumb & Dumber), Cameron Diaz (There's Something About Mary), Peter Riegert (Animal House), Richard Jeni (Platypus Man) and Amy Yasbeck (Pretty Woman).This hits on every funny bone. The storyline is very clever and creates a character that is easy to root for. The dialogue is outstanding and Carey is a gem. This is definitely one of his masterpieces and the chemistry of the cast and how fluid they were with him was brilliant. The CGI was fun, and the soundtrack is legendary. Every character is entertaining and the ending is triumphant.You can't say anything bad about this movie. This is comedic genre gold.

SSSSSSSSSSSmokin'!!!,"This is one of Jim Carrey's best! Prior to ""Ace Ventura"", ""The Mask"" is full entertainment. Very cartoony, it makes ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" a class project.

""The Mask"" is so unbelievable, even the ""Cuban Pete"" number was an actual video. That video will make everyone dance. Stanley Ipkiss(Carrey) was the hero of this movie, when Dorian Tyrell(Peter Greene) showed evil when he wore the mask. he even took out other bad guys with that power. Then Milo, Ipkiss' dog uses the mask's power to take on the gang himself. It was a blast! A super hit for Carrey, don't get me wrong, this movie was not a letdown, not one bit!

"""The Mask"" movie review","I just watched the movie ""The Mask"" and I have many thoughts. The movie starts with us meeting our hero of the story; Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey), a hopeless romantic bank clerk who discovers a magical green mask that when he puts it on he becomes this chaotic and outgoing superhero-like character. While working he meets Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz) who is secretly helping the notorious crime boss Dorian Tyrel (Peter Greene).After having the worst day ever he discovers a mask that embodies the spirit of Loki who was banished by the Norse Gods. His night time adventures as the mask turn into a life or death fight when one of the close members of Dorian Tyrel's gang is killed during a bank robbery where The Mask is present.After having the worst day ever he discovers a mask that embodies the spirit of Loki who was banished by the Norse Gods. His night time adventures as the mask turn into a life or death fight when one of the close members of Dorian Tyrel's gang is killed during a bank robbery where The Mask is present.Jim Carrey's performance was phenomenal. His facial expression and overall body language was on point. Both his and his co-star Cameron Diaz did an amazing job and it was a pleasure to watch.I enjoyed watching it and it's a great movie to watch if you're feeling nostalgic. It's a feel-good comedy for any moment you need to laugh. If you're a fan of Jim Carrey you will definitely love this.While there is no obvious theme, you can interpret the moral of the story as ""just be yourself"". Overall there is no deep meaning like some other movies but you can find some hidden meanings along the movie.If you're under 13 I don't recommend watching. It has some mature themes. I would rate it PG-13. If you have a more mature 10-12 year old you could attempt to watch it with them.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Not very good at all.,"This film really didn't work for me. Though you can tell that Jim Carrey tried hard and I think it's only fair to say his performance is not too bad, the rest of the film is nonsensical and a bit of a waste of time despite some funny moments. In hindsight, that was Cameron Diaz, was it? Very forgettable performance from her. And it may be just me, but that bald green head actually freaked me out more than amuse me. 4 out of 10 at most.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Undoubtedly SMOKIN',"The Mask is another 90s classic from Jim Carrey that successfully utilises his elastic eccentricities, as well as being a creatively rich and colourful film in itself.The performance from Carrey is unhinged and absolutely golden, delivering every single joke perfectly and selling the hopeless romantic he's playing. The setting of the fictional Edge City is great and the supporting cast are all really good, from the cops to the crooks. The music makes the movie feel like a more lively rendition of the 40s and 50s gangster films, with the numerous costumes of the Mask matching that aesthetic to a hilarious degree.My only criticism comes from the plot, which is kinda your basic cliché gangster story coated in a fun colour of paint.The Mask is the conglomeration of cartoonish Carrey carnage, culminating in a crazy conclusion backed up by a capable cast playing captivating characters.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
SMOKIN'!,"I happen to be a huge fan of Jim Carrey, and yet until last night, I had never seen The Mask, which was one of his breakout roles in 1994 (alongside Dumb and Dumber and Ace Ventura). But last night, I had the luck of attending a 35mm screening of it with my dad, and you better believe how much I enjoyed it!In this hilarious adventure, Jim Carrey plays Stanley Ipkiss, a timid clerk at Edge City Bank, who yearns for more success and excitement in his life. But one night, Stanley gets his wish when he finds an ancient, magical mask imbued with the spirit of the Norse god Loki. The second Stanley puts the mask on, it turns him into an energetic and charismatic superhuman, allowing him to catch the eye of local nightclub singer Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz). But there's a problem; the mask's influence also causes Stanley to rob the bank that he works at. This infuriates junior crime lord Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene), whose goons get blamed for the robbery.The acting in this movie is just tops. Jim Carrey is a sheer delight as Stanley, ESPECIALLY with the mask. No wonder this movie was one of his breakout roles! Cameron Diaz is lovely as Tina. Added to which, their chemistry is off the charts! Peter Greene is a terrific villain as Dorian. In addition, Stanley's dog Milo is very cute, and even he acts great!In addition, the movie is just packed head to toe with delightful comedy! Of course, most of it is supplied by Stanley when he's wearing the mask. And you better believe how much I was laughing. But despite this, the movie also knows exactly when to take itself seriously! There's some great suspense, especially with Dorian. The movie is also touching when necessary!Also, the special effects are something else! A terrific mix of prosthetics and groundbreaking CGI animation. This movie got heavy praise in this area for good reason! I mean, yeah, it definitely doesn't hold up as well by today's standards, but it definitely looks really, really good for the time the movie was released.And then, lastly, the music! Randy Edelman's score for this movie is fabulous; it's very comical and humorous in all the funniest scenes, very tender and heartfelt in the more touching scenes, and very tense in the more dramatic scenes. Just the way a good movie score should be! The movie also makes great use of songs.Everything considered, The Mask is a very funny, clever and visually inventive movie, and showcases one of Jim Carrey's best performances.

Great movie,"This is a great movie, i watched it so many times. It's a must watch this on.""The Mask"" is a wildly entertaining movie that showcases Jim Carrey's incredible talent for physical comedy.

The movie's blend of humor, romance, and supernatural elements makes for a fun ride.The film's visuals and special effects hold up surprisingly well even today, with many praising the innovative use of makeup and CGI to bring the Mask to life . Cameron Diaz also shines in her role as Tina Carlyle, a nightclub singer who catches the eye of Stanley Ipkiss (Carrey).While some critics found the humor to be hit-or-miss, the general consensus is that ""The Mask"" is a hilarious and entertaining movie that's perfect for fans of Jim Carrey's brand of comedy .

a comedic classic for its irreverent humor and surprisingly awesome visuals,"Despite a poorly constructed story, The Mask remains a comedic classic for its irreverent humor and surprisingly awesome visuals. Jim Carrey's perfect slapstick comedy cannot save a paper thin narrative and characterization. Cameron Diaz, in her first film appearance, stands alongside Carrey albeit being overshadowed, cementing herself as a sex symbol with a juicy performance. The motivations of the characters are not properly fleshed out for a satisfying conclusion. Having a weak antagonist also does not help.The Mask can't be called a waste because the comedy is stupidly great, especially the police dancing sequence and Looney Tunes references, making the film essentially a live-action derivative of the iconic cartoon characters. However, as a satisfying film with great characters and story it drops the ball.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Cheesy 90s with amazing comedy,"It's a cheesy 90s as you can get type of movie. Filled with 90s music, pop culture references lots and lots of cheesy one liners and cheesy characters.

He goes fully cartoon it relies on primarily physical and random comedy and works perfectly, Jim Carey was literally built for this role. The comedy works even better because the characters act like the mask is so normal which is such a hilarious contrast lmao. The Stanley stuff isn't quite as good, it's a lot more grounded which makes you miss the insane mask stuff a little bit. That being said it's definitely needed and I think without it the movie would be much much weaker, we need to like Stanley and want to see him succeed and the movie does that perfectly with the Stanley scenes.

I have a unique love/hate relationship with this movie.,"I'll be honest. I had social anxiety for years after watching this movie. I'll tell you why. We are all like Stanley Ipkiss at one point in our lives, and we want some all-powerful mask to solve our problems and get the hot woman, beat the bad guys, make us the confident hero, all the obvious stereotypes. Not to mention, it should make us less of a people pleaser and want to stand up for ourselves. But the Mask only amplifies in spades what you already have. It just made Dorian more evil. However, what Tina reveals to Stanley in the jail scene is that he won her over in the bank scenes, when he didn't even have the Mask with him. He already had the good qualities that she was looking for, and he didn't have to use the Mask to express them. It chalks this movie up to that age-old concept of believing in yourself and going after the life you want. I didn't see that scene as a kid, or either I was too young to understand it. Having rewatched it as an adult to figure out why it had so much staying power with me, it's obvious why. It's not a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination, though it tries to stretch your imagination a few times. But it is an entertaining movie, and I will always give it props for that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"""...Jimmy, a Mask named Jim Carrey!""","This film is a cult classic. Those six words are enough to describe the movie itself from my view.I never really got into it when I was younger (maybe cause I never SAW it!) But then early this year, since I am a HUGE cartoon fan, I decided to check it out. And boy, did I miss out on a lot of fun, which I was finally able to be part of! For starters, THIS is the film where Jim Carrey's zany/goofy antics are absolutely perfect and in time with the movie he is starring in. This movie even made me like Jim Carrey a bit more (I previously saw him in ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"" which was actually kinda good IMO). And it gave me my first glimpse of Cameron Diaz, which was appropriate since it was her debut film role as the beautiful miss Tina Carlyle. And was she ever sexy! Combine the Girl of ""Red Hot Riding Hood,"" Jessica Rabbit, and Daphne from ""Scooby-Doo,"" and you've got a great character with a great actress! Ben Stein was also great, too. I get a kick out of hearing his ""boring"" voice! The plot is one I can identify with. A social misfit that loves cartoons... almost kinda like ME! (Though I'm a bit more socially successful than Stanley Ipkiss was). And after a terrible day, he finds the ancient mask that transforms him into... THE MASK! From here on, it's classic cartoon bouncy/zany stuff whenever The Mask is lurking! Unfortunately, he is only the Mask for 30 minutes of the film, maybe because this was produced in 1994 and they didn't want to blow a lot of money with extensive use of CGI animation (Remember, CGI was state-of-the-art for its time back in 1994!) The Mask is able to whirl like the Tasmanian Devil, seduce like a Pepe Le Pew clone, carry many things up his sleeve, and just put a smile on your face.The Mask's cartoony antics are very similar to (and reminiscent of) some of the great super-cartoony classics, such as the Tex Avery cartoons, some of Bob Clampett's best works, and ""A Pup Named Scooby-Doo!"" (Great show, BTW!) The CGI animation is state-of-the-art for its time (Shame this film didn't win the Oscar for best special effects!) Some of my favorite bits include the lines ""It's party time! P-A-R-T... Y? Because I GOTTA!"" and ""I believe my friends are (on the guest list for the Coco Bongo club), perhaps you know them... Franklin, Grant and Jackson!"" and ""Let's ROCK THIS JOINT!"" I also loved it when The Mask squeezed that little horn at the car, but the horn lets out a long verbal ""AAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGAH!"" as loud as a Chrysler air raid siren, as well as when he is asked by a punk if he's got the time, The Mask gets out a ticking clock and says ""Look at THAT! It's exactly two seconds before I honk your nose and pull your underwear over your head!"" This then results in The Mask's first wedgie! And his little balloon animal show... ""For you sir... a French Poodle!"" *BANG! Sputter...* ""Sorry son, the dog was rabid, had to put it down!"" And what about the Hey Pachuco musical number, and The Mask's ""Oscar-winning performance"" (complete with an animated applauding audience silhouette!) Personally, my all-time favorite part in this movie is when The Mask goes to the Coco Bongo nightclub, and among seeing the sexy Tina Carlyle, he bugs his eyes out, unfurls his tongue on the ground, pounds his heart through his chest, and then he MORPHS INTO A 'TOON WOLF AND HOWLS AT HER, THEN WOLF-WHISTLES AND BANGS HIS HEAD WITH A MALLET! That wolf scene is a thousand times better than any werewolf transformation I have ever seen on film!Whew... glad I got all that out. Anyways, one of the best movies ever made.

"There's absolutely no masking of the fun here, this film is hugely entertaining","Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a glorified bank teller and a shy, ""nice guy"". This means his salary, prestige, and success with women are very limited. Living in a small apartment with his faithful dog, Milo, and with the landlady from Hades next door, Stanley keeps trying, nevertheless. When the lovely Tina Carlisle (Cameron Diaz), a lounge singer, comes to open an account, Ipkiss is more than attentive and gracious. One day later, his car breaks down and he is also thrown into the gutter by a pretentious nightclub bouncer. Ending up in a river, our hero finds an old wooden mask. For some unknown reason, he takes the relic home and flings it onto the couch. But, aha! That mask is magic and the following evening, Stanley is compelled to put it on. From that moment, Stanley is transformed, when the sun goes down, into a green-faced, super-powered, ultra-confident man. Heading toward the nightclub where he was rejected, he scores a hit with the crowd and with the lovely Tina. But, during the night, he also beats up some thugs and scared his landlady, so the police detective (Peter Riegert) comes by to ask questions. With the mob gaining power in the town, especially Tina's horrific boyfriend, Dorian, the detective wants to curtail the criminal activity. But, can Stanley avoid the urge when the mask's powerful magnetism comes calling? This is a hugely entertaining film that masks none of the fun from its intended audience. Although there is enough violence and sexual connotations to make the film unsuitable for the youngest, older children and adults will delight in the flick's antics and Carrey's irresistible performance. As the man who goes from ""zero to hero"", Carrey's genius for physical comedy is a total delight. The supporting cast is also nice, with Diaz a huge asset in her first major film, for she is utterly gorgeous and sweet. Riegert, too, is dead-pan fun as the uber-serious detective, while all of the other cast members give equally memorable turns. The setting in seedy ""Edge City"" is marvelously tacky while the costumes, especially Tina's knockout outfits, are very nice. As for the script, the direction, and the special effects, they are all beyond great. Miraculous might be a better word! In short, if your goal for an evening's film choice is to laugh, laugh, and laugh some more, here is a first tier candidate. It would be difficult to see anyone not having a swell time while watching The Mask.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"Goofy, silly, dark fun","I loved The Mask when it first came out. It feels a little dated now, but I still enjoy it, and it still appeals to kids. This movie is an odd mixture. The goofy story bounces along without any care, but it also has a darker and violent side that I didn't really notice as a kid. Still, it's easy to see why this movie helped catapult Jim Carrey into stardom.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Imaginative,"This film is probably Jim Carrey at his comedic best. This film really suits his style because he is so outspoken and energetic, which can seem unnatural for a regular human, so having a supernaturally expressive character is the perfect vessel for him. He finds himself in all sorts of imaginative and zany scenarios that allow him to express his comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Disappointment.,"I was looking forward to this film so much before it arrived. And I was so disappointed as soon as I saw that all the brutality that made the comic series so good. The movie was transformed to a totally kiddie movie and all the fun was gone. A better idea would be that The Wachowski Brothers would do it instead, they sure know how to do a perfect movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One of the finest comedies ever,"The Mask has got to be one of the best comedies ever, everything here smells originality. If you've seen a Jim Carrey movie you know his style, he tends to overdo a little sometimes but he manages to stay funny, a lot of people don't like him because of all the weird stuff he throws in while acting, but this movie can change some minds about Carrey. The Mask follows the story of Stanley Ipkins, an average guy who finds an ancient Scandinavian mask, it contains within the Norse god Loki banished and imprisoned, now whoever puts on the mask gets possesses by the joker spirit of the god gaining incredible powers and the will to cause problems.In The Mask Carrey plays two characters, one is the more-than- regular Stanley Ipkins, who's a shy fan of cartoons and works at a bank, he's not good with the ladies and the world seems to conspire against him at all costs, luck sure doesn't seem to enjoy playing on the side of Ipkins at all. The other is when he puts on the mask and transforms himself into a green-masked party-boy maniac, ready to joke all around town, all his romantic repression is unleashed and he starts acting in a cartoony style much like the cartoons he enjoys so much seeing. There are funny scenes all around but the highlights are when Carrey puts on the mask, including dance scenes; one is particularly funny because it has a cover music track of Cuban Pete sang by Carrey himself, seems like the song was destined to be funny. The movie also features the debut of Cameron Diaz when she actually looked cute and not a super-sized barbie doll.If you like Carrey you really should see this movie because it's one of the best stuff Carrey ever pulled. If you're not a fan, you can still enjoy it because he also plays a normal character that's actually normal, without the weird faces, with the crazy stuff being performed by his masked person, although the crazyness is probably boosted, it's easily understandable since he's indeed possessed. If you're still not convinced about Carrey maybe his comedies aren't for you, you can probably enjoy Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind anyway.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
It really is a spicy meatball!,A spicy little classic is what it is. Super funny because of Jim. The special effects were and still are excellent hilarious entertainment as well.

"Dr. Carrey, Mr. Mask ... and the cinematic tribute to the greatest cartoon director!...","Along with ""Dumb and Dumber"" and ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"", Chuck Russell's ""The Mask"" is part of that 1994 trinity that finally, and forever, put Jim Carrey in Hollywood map. He was certainly a successful and relatively known comedian before but I'm sure the size of his house and the relationship with his banker had considerably improved in 1995.And it was a deserved success, as only the big screen could do justice to this face-of-thousand-faces, to this extraordinary elasticity and capability to transform into a celebrity or to express any possible emotion, or both. Just look at Carrey becoming James Dean, it takes him a few seconds but it's like watching a live metamorphosis and the result is outstanding, he seems to have a rubber-made face that can use every single muscle. And when you see the two other movies, you realize that Carrey has elevated the word 'grimace' to the rank of high art, and that in fact, he didn't need the mask to be the Mask, still, he needed ""The Mask"" to show that he was Carrey before the Mask.Indeed, the paradox of ""The Mask"" is that it uses Carrey's talent with a device that is a green rubber mask and one of the first use of CGI to create Tex Avery-like special effects, and that premises gives the misleading impression that the faces Carrey makes are the results of special effects. Yet, this paradox helps the movies and Carrey's career as well, as it allows him to play a more human and appealing character than Ace Ventura and Lloyd Christmas. As the meek and shy Stanley Ipkiss, Carrey can let his more sensitive side being expressed and create a likable character in the same vein than Buster Keaton or Charlie Chaplin and let his Mask-counterpart act like Harpo Marx.Ipkiss is a timid bank clerk who's get bullied by everyone and he has no one to vent his anger on, he just comes back home, talks with his dog Milo and watches a few Tex Avery cartoons and envies the wolf's exuberance and liberty. It's like Jim Carrey wishing to be Jim Carrey. We finally have glimpses on a realistic facet of the actor's range and it does have a few serious undertones as it explores the traditional 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde' dual personalities theme with a sort of Faustian notion that there's a price to pay for being better by cheating, that it might lead to mayhem and a false impression of happiness. But he's only human and when he discovers that mask on the beach, he can't resist.And he has a taste on how it feels to live like a Tex Avery character and becomes one of the greatest creation of the 90's, a guy dressed in the typical zoot suit and act like a real version of Genie from ""Aladdin"" with some of the obnoxiousness of Ace Ventura. Yet, there's no doubt that ""The Mask"" is 100% original creation, and a source of gags and music like no comedy had provided since the Golden Age. The film is punctuated by great musical numbers, a magnificent Cuban party, a Konga with policemen and prostitutes, some impressions where Carrey can deliver his comical talent and so many unforgettable punchlines as ""Smokin'"" or ""Somebody stop me!"".But if it wasn't just for a series of 'unstoppable' stunts, musical vignettes and other comedic numbers, the film would have quickly become redundant. There's also great performances, besides Carrey who, for once, is allowed to tone down his usual zaniness and shows a true vulnerability, and manages to look sweet and handsome. There's the scene-stealing dog, who has a great talent to read the lips, and it contributes to one of the film's best gags, totally lost in the original French version I saw and it tells something when the film's best gag doesn't involve the main character.And there is the love interest, played by Cameron Diaz, in a film debut kids who became teens in the mid-90's never forgot, I plead guilty as I remember having rented the VHS only for her entrance and the nightclub sequence. Diaz is amazingly sexy, sensual and beautiful as the equivalent of Tex Avery red-headed pin-up, it's not just the body but perhaps her smile that makes her so appealing, but Diaz just doesn't play the pin-up, she's as convincing in her acting as Carrey and even pulls out dramatic expressions when the situation requires it. Both Carrey and Diaz deserve credit for their performance, and the scene where they dance together is the greatest tribute to Tex Avery, and the film had me if only it gave tribute to my favorite cartoon director.It was 'no holds barred' with Tex Avery, but that's not true, Tex Avery cartoons, as crazy and nonsensical as they were, were not just successions of fourth-wall-breaking moments, mindless screams, wild explosions or chases that never added up to the plot, don't get ""The Whacky World of Tex Avery"" and good old Tex Avery cartoons mixed, Avery was a storyteller, and ""The Mask"" doesn't take its zaniness for granted and can afford a good plot with an obligatory antagonist, well-played by Peter Greene, a mid-90's figure who seems to have disappeared from the screen (he was Zed in ""Pulp Fiction"" and Redfoot in ""The Usual Suspects""), an embittered cop with his jovial assistant, and a nice climactic confrontation where the Mask shows its limits, when worn by the wrong person or animal (Muttley-like-laugh)Indeed, it's better to act according to our true nature, and it doesn't take a mask to reveal who we are, in Ipkiss' case, the mask was just the catalysis for a new departure and for Carrey's career. I have a feeling ever since he started doing these comical roles, Carrey has tried to prove he was more an Ipkiss than a Mask, this shows how defining the movie is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Do you ever wonder why you enjoyed movie more in the theatre than when you bought it on blu ray it home? We all know films are more exciting and exhilirating when watching them in the theatre (i.e. more immersive). The simple answer of course as to why our viewing experiences are better in theatres than at home has to do with the limitations of our media to view it at home (TV's, blu ray playes, home theatre systems, etc.). With the advancements of todays technologies in televisions now days such as high resolution TVs (4k's and beyond), improved media formats (blu ray, 4k UHD) and frame rate manipulation (24P vs 60P) etc., among many other features, this has brought us closer than we've ever been to being able to match theatre qualities that ultimately give us that same immersive experience. Unfortunately some new features of todays tech can actually hurt the viewing experience as well. Your setup is going to be vital to how you experience a film and ultimately what you thougt of it. You may be telling yourself ""well duh, everyone knows that, so whats your point?"" The point I'm trying to make is that not everyone knows this and may have an improper setup when writing a reviews on a film. This is especially concerning to me when I see reviews suggesting films were ""bad,"" ""outdated,"" or ""what were they thinking, people actually thought this was good."" Case in point, PLEASE, make sure you have the proper settings when viewing films before making a review on it as it can most certainly effect what you thought of it.I am a film lover and nothing brings me more satisfaction than to see others experience that same level joy as I do. Conversely, nothing upsets me more than to see a good film get torn to shreds due to an inadequate setup. So instead of giving you my 2 cent review of a film, since there are so many good reviewers out there already, I will simply rate the film and state whether I thought it was good, bad, ok or excellent and tell you how I watched it. Obviously settings are subjectable to each setup and individual perspective and I am in no way shape or form suggesting that my way is the only correct way but rather this is how I enjoyed it and you might like it that way too.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Just hilarious and wonderful,"I can never get why some people say things about this movie like ""it's a great movie, but average"". Man, this movie is a masterpiece! Why?

And I don't say this like a personal view of it. It is a wonderful movie. It got something really important: all movie elements. You know; such as love, drama, humor (especially), action. But not horror, thinking about it... Anyway; if you haven't seen this movie, you should.

Tex Avery Lives,"One of the Best Movies of the 1990's. This is a Charming Homage to Animator Tex Avery and a Perfect Role for Jim Carrey. Oh yea, Cameron Diaz in Her Debut is Drop Dead Gorgeous.

He was a Legendary Groundbreaker in the World of Cartoons and is a Name often Linked to the likes of Walt Disney and Max Fleischer.But this Film stands alone because it is so well Crafted that it cannot be Overlooked in its near Perfectness. Everything comes together here as a Work of Art. There is the use of State of the Art SFX (1994), a Bravura Performance from Carrey, a Stunning and Full Musical Performance from Diaz, and a Brilliant Amalgamation of Cartoon and Live Action.

Unmasking the wasteful ideas from other movies.,"THE MASK was not very good. Jim Carrey tries too hard to be funny, and seems to be the perfect role model for a guy with the green face.

That's among the plentiful you'll discover here. I also remember how this film was marketed.

I love this movie and can't say anything bad about it.,"THE MASKI remember watching this when it first came out. It was such a big thing back then.The movie is about a sad lonely banker who finds a mask one day. When he goes home and tries it on the mask sticks to his face and changes him into a completely different person. The problem is, he robs a bank that a criminal organisation were already going to raid. Now they are after him as well as the police.This is a comedy that is more like a cartoon than live action. There is slapstick as well as musical sequences. But it is all so well done that you can't help but watch it in wonder.The movie stars Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz. This was Camerons first movie. She was very good in it considering she didn't have much acting experience. Jim was fantastic in this, Back in the 90s is when Jim was in his prime. He was making so many great movies back then and he was so funny. This is probably my favourite Jim Carrey film. He is still making good movies now, but they just don't seem to be as funny as the ones he made back in the day. One of my favourite characters ion the film though is not even human. Milo was fantastic. Milo was Jims dog in the movie. The dog that was used was so well trained that even he was really funny and made me laugh so much.As I said before, there are some musical numbers in the film. Yes it is done in a very cheesy way, but it fits in with the movie very well. The songs are very catchy and funny to watch... especially Cuban Pete. I actually bought the 12"" vinyl single of this back in 1994.The special effects are still very good even for now... so you can imagine how good they were when the movie came out in 1994. It really was amazing back then and it was completely awesome to watch.There is a sequel to The Mask called the Son of the Mask... avoid at all costs. It is terrible and really destroys this classic film.The Mask is so funny and very entertaining. It really is one of my favourite films from the 90s.I will give this film 8 out of 10.""Hold on, sugar!

SSSmokin' indeed. Jim Carrey is a comedic tornado.,"This is my favorite Jim Carrey film of all time.I love this film quite a bit. It's fast, it's fun, and it's funny.Stanley Ipkiss(Jim Carrey) is a bank clerk, he's nice guy, that lets everyone stomp all over him, not to mention that he is a hopeless romantic. He stumbles upon an ancient mask that represent the Norse mythology god Loki. Upon wearing the mask he receives superpowers and brings his inner most desires to life.What I love most about this film is that there is a duality between Stanley Ipkiss and the Mask. As Stanley he's shy, timid, mild-mannered, a good guy who gets taken advantage of. But, when he puts on the mask, he's the complete opposite, he's able to become someone he wishes to be: full of wisecracks, jokes, cartoony antics, and full of confidence who chases after Stanley's love interest Tina who is portrayed by Cameron Diaz. I believe this is the film that showcases just how good of an actor Jim Carrey really is. He's able to remain as human as possible, perhaps even a little relatable to some guys as Stanley Ipkiss, but he's able to go off and show off his physical comedy as the Mask. He is literally bringing a cartoon character to life. It's very memorizing. I sincerely believe this is an underrated performance by Jim Carrey.The supporting cast is great. I liked everyone in this film. Peter Riegert is great at Lt. Mitch Kellaway who chases after the Mask, who suspects that the identity of the Mask is Stanley. Peter Greene is great as the villain Dorian, a complete jerk from the beginning. Cameron Diaz is good in her supporting role as the love interest, there is decent chemistry between her and Jim Carrey. Oh and she is also absolutely gorgeous in the film, stunning really. Richard Jeni is also very good as Stanley's best friend at his job. The real supporting character that steals the spotlight is Stanley's dog Milo. A great sidekick and director Chuck Russell puts good use into the dog and actually serves the plot.For 1994, the visuals are impressive and frankly still hold up very well. The disappointing aspect of this film was Amy Yasbeck's character Peggy who is a writer for a newspaper, and a semi-love interest for Stanley. There's a neat twist in the film involving her character, but she abruptly disappears in the film, I already know the behind the scenes story involving her character, but the film doesn't wrap her arc and it's very apparent. The other thing I would have liked to see is the reaction of what the Mask is able to do with his abilities, nobody in the film seems like it's a big deal that he's continuously traveling in a tornado, or able to elongate his body, let alone do everything physically impossible, especially Lt. Kellaway. It doesn't have too much credibility in that department.This film is will always have a special place in my heart, as cheesy as it sounds. The Mask is the first film I watched on VHS. Batman Forever being the first film I ever saw in theaters. Both which stars Jim Carrey. It's really because of Jim and this movie that really got me into films in my youth it opened the doors for me. Green also happens to be my favorite color because he frequently plays characters that are green. What I love about this film is that this film has somewhat of a deeper message. As quoted by Ben Stein who has a role in the film, ""We all wear masks."" Stanley Ipkiss actually wears a mask in the film, he wants to be something else, but he's too afraid and too timid, and the mask provides his desires, eventually he learns to become the man he wants to be and doesn't really need the mask anymore.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
One crazy movie with a lot of funny moments!,"The Mask is a 1994 comedy and slapstick movie starring Jim Carrey. It is about Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey), a bank clerk, who lets people push him around and never stands up for himself. One night he finds a mask, and whenever he puts it on he becomes a crazy wild man. The Mask is a great movie that has so many good things about it. Jim Carrey gives a great performance as both Stanley Ipkiss and The Mask. Him as Stanley Ipkiss was pretty funny because he makes everything weird and awkward, which is funny, and when he becomes The Mask, it's one of the craziest and funniest scenes you will see. Jim Carrey has really good chemistry with Cameron Diaz as well. Cameron Diaz gives a really good performance in this movie considering the fact that this was her first movie ever. I really like all the characters in this movie and everyone gives a really good performance as well. Chuck Russell did a really good job directing this movie, and the screenplay written by Mike Werb was also very good. The special effects, in my opinion, still hold up to this day. They are still really good and really cool to look at. The comedy and slapstick is utilized very well in the movie, and that's mostly from Jim Carrey, and it's hard to think that Jim Carrey wasn't even the first choice for Stanley Ipkiss and The Mask. The studio's first choice for the role of Stanley Ipkiss and The Mask was Matthew Broderick, so they were considering him for the role. There were other actors considered for the role, but Jim Carrey was the best choice for the role. My only issue with the movie is the tone. It doesn't know what kind of movie it wants to be. The movie can't decide if it wants to be a comedy or a darker kind of movie. I know the movie is based on comic books, and the comic books are very dark and brutal, but they did decide to change that for the movie and go a more friendly way, so I can't really give the movie a pass for that, but that's my only issue with the movie. The Mask is an awesome movie with great performances, great special effects, a really funny screenplay, and the movie is just very entertaining. It may not have a consistent tone, but the movie is still very good. If you haven't seen The Mask yet, go and watch it, it's really good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Not smokin',"The Mask is a movie which certainly has some positive things going for it. But there are plenty of things working against the movie too. In the end it all balances out to leave us with a movie which isn't great but isn't terrible either. There are some good things to appreciate but not enough of them to prevent the movie from ultimately being somewhat disappointing.The story follows shy, luckless, dorky Stanley Ipkiss. An ordinary guy. Ordinary that is until he finds an ancient wooden mask which when he puts it on transforms him into a wacky, green-headed superhero. He's a crazed whirling dervish with all kinds of wonderfully exploitable powers. He's got speed, he's got strength, he seems indestructible. And he can conjure anything he wants out of thin air. Stanley's luck is about to change. Now he can exact revenge on his tormentors. And he can get the girl. Yeah, there's always a girl.This is a seemingly perfect movie for Jim Carrey, enabling him to just go nuts. A guy like Carrey can have a lot of fun with something like this. Which makes the fact that the movie so often seems devoid of fun rather puzzling. Oh, Carrey surely has his moments. But somehow, even with the bundle of energy that is The Mask at its heart, the movie often is a little dull. Too much dead space between Carrey's best moments. And while Peter Greene does fine in playing the movie's main villain Dorian Tyrell the rest of the bad guys leave a lot to be desired. You don't expect the actors playing the thugs in a movie like this to all be little Brandos and De Niros but is it so much to ask that the actors at least be competent? No such luck, it's strictly amateur hour with these guys. Some truly cringe-inducing acting. Everyone involved, from Carrey on down, is not helped by a script heavy on puns which are very hit and miss. Carrey is so manic that he can make most things work and at least extract a mild chuckle from the audience. Other performers aren't so fortunate.The film has its good pieces. The visual effects are undeniably terrific, the film looks great from beginning to end. Carrey does an admirable job bringing his crazed character to life. And there is one thing about the movie which is indeed ""Smokin!"" That would be Cameron Diaz. She plays the aforementioned girl for whom Stanley longs. To say Diaz is a jaw-dropper in this, her film debut, doesn't even begin to do her justice. And besides looking ridiculously, impossibly gorgeous she shows she can actually act too, so that's a nice bonus. You've got Carrey, you've got Diaz, you've got a decent lead villain and those dazzling effects. But it doesn't all quite add up. The story lets down the movie. It's not consistently funny enough and there are times where the story really struggles for any momentum at all. At times, too many times, things are rather mundane. And mundane is not what you're looking for when you turn Jim Carrey into a whirling dervish superhero.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The Mask: The king of the rumba beat,"Now this is a movie that everyone should see: The Mask.Stanley Ipkiss (played by the young and mighty Jim Carrey) has never had too much luck in his life.

His pockets loaded with ridiculous gadgets and his mouth filled with cheesy one liners.The Mask is a lot of fun to watch. Rarely does a movie take you to such an unusual situation and makes it relateable to the audience. Jim Carrey executes his role with comedic perfection. His voice, movements and expressions almost make it seem as if he had once upon a time been a maniac with the green face. The other actress that needs a mentioning is Cameron Diaz, making her debut as one of the sexiest women of all time. She brings all the boys out their seats and makes all the women jealous. Don't be surprise if you keep coming back to see this movie just because of her.I recommend this movie to those who are looking for a fun time.

Iconic if only because it's funny,"Jim Carrey scored a home run with this film. I have to say, The Mask was one of my favorite Jim Carrey movies if only because he gets to bounce around the screen like a cartoon character. He was made for a role that's literally a cartoon. Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) is a foil to his alter ego in the mask, who is almost a character on his own. Not only does it show the regular character growth that comes in a movie like this, it presents more comedy than some ""comparable"" works like ""Stranger Than Fiction"" from Will Ferrell.Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz) is the perfect ""unattainable"" girl for Stanley: hot, almost oppressed, and may actually be looking for a nice guy - even if she doesn't realize it. Though that may be a little cliché, it works because Stanley gets the girl in the end.I think the real shame was that they couldn't get Carrey for the sequel and that the Son of the Mask turned out to be such a flop.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Jim Carrey's Best Year,"The mask is about Stanley Ipkiss, a social bank worker loser. Being thrown out of a new club, his girlfriend tricking him so she wont have to go to a concert with him and hated by everyone, his life is turned around when he discovers a mask floating in the river on a dead scuba diver. Once putting it on, he turns into a cartoon like man who only has time for jokes. With this mask he can seek revenge on his enemies. This movie was one of my all time favorites for Jim Carrey was very funny and the music was great. My advice: go see it for you'll have a great time watching it over and over again.Who wouldn't like this movie The Mask 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Brief review of the Mask,"The mask is movie directed by Chuck Russel and it has Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz in its casting. The movie nearly doesn't even have a story and some of ways very silly. I had seen this movie in my childhood and I was remembering it was a funny movie. Although the movie has keeps its funny side, it is watchable because of Jim Carrey's performance. Without Carrey it cannot be watchable. Briefly, for me it is a mediocre comedy movie thanks to Jim Carrey because he is the only good thing in the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"Pure fun, yeah !!!",I think this film is better to watch two times - so you could give a real price to the actors phrases... Jim could play this role even without a mask i think :) One of the best comedies with great special effects - the best of which is Jimmy The Mask :) If you have never seen it - you missed a lot ! And Cameron (her first role i guess?) - she is just wonderful.,9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Milo is the real star of this movie.,"I truly enjoy watching this movie whenever it's on. Jim Carrey was spot on with what his role needed to be be and was fun to watch. I remember the first time I saw Cameron Diaz and was amazed at her beauty and I thought she did a great job in her first movie role. I enjoyed the henchmen, thugs in the park, and the two leaders of the bad guys at loggerheads with each other. The dim witted banter between Doyle and the Lt was not necessary but didn't hurt anything either. The movie as a whole was a worthwhile watch. That said, the true star of the movie is MILO. Every damn scene with him in it was awesome. The scene where he is jumping trying to get to Ipkiss in the jail cell always makes me laugh my ass off. I was always a big dog person who didn't care at all for small dogs until I saw Milo in action. We now have 4 small personality filled dogs in my house all thanks to Milo's influence.I will watch this movie with it's limited CGI over any of the garbage coming out of Hollywood these days. RIP Milo!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Jim Carrey's Role,"For the few Dark Horse Comics that have been adapted onto the big screen, this one was done right. Along with Dumb and Dumber (1994) and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (1994), this is the other film that really had the public tracking down who in the world was Jim Carrey. In my opinion, just like how the character of Lara Croft fit Angelina Jolie really well, the character of The Mask is the perfect role for Carrey. From what we've learned about Carrey, he is a living cartoon and still loves to watch cartoons. So in a sense, being The Mask was not hard task for this actor.Originally the personality of The Mask was much more violent and brutal than the one in this film. Jim Carrey wanted to give the character of The Mask more of a comedic touch. This was a good direction to go because that IS Jim Carrey's strong point. Carrey can be psychotically funny but not psychotically insane. He even proves in this film that he can sing! Another individual who starts off her career at a promising level is Cameron Diaz. And not only did she start her career off right, but also she's now one of the highest grossing actresses. That's luck if you ask me.What's great about Carrey is how he acts. He can be great as a cartoon character AND he's even more convincing as a wimp (as his alter ego, Stanley Ipkiss). What made Carrey more effective in this film than the other two he made in 1994 was that his energy (which is pretty high), was under control. Because of that, this probably gave Carrey's character more of likableness. As Ace Ventura or Lloyd Christmas, he was more or less free to do whatever he thought was funny on screen. In movies like those, you either really love the character he plays or you absolutely loath it to no end.As for the comedic part of this film, CGI is used, but it is used as it should be used; as a tool. All the CGI does, is enhance Carrey's cartoon mannerisms into a heck of a performance. From bouncing around like a rubber ball or having his eyes popping out, it makes the scenes that are funny even funnier. There are even parts in this film that have The Mask reference other characters from other movies. Things like that are what make this film all the more better to watch. Composer Randy Edelman provided the score behind this film. I like the music that he made for this. Edelman made good use of making the music sound animated when The Mask was on screen and calm when Stanley Ipkiss took over. Although I liked the music, my real appreciation lies within the film of Gettysburg (1993). The kind of music that he made for that movie was spiritually moving.As a last comment, I would like to say that I really did like this movie. This was my first Jim Carrey movie and after watching his performance, he has become one of my favorite actors to watch. However, I would be interested in seeing a remake of this film sometime in the future. Not to say Carrey's performance wasn't good but I would be more interested to see The Mask in his true form; a brutal, narcissistic psychopath. I say this because that's what the character originally was. Jim Carrey does quote a couple of moments from the original comic book but it isn't carried out the same way in the end. As a first choice, I would like to see Carrey play The Mask again but in the way The Mask originally was. And if Carrey wouldn't do it, then I would just be in the mood of seeing how it would turn out. But to be realistic, this is probably as good as its going to get.With a role that practically IS Jim Carrey, The Mask succeeds on all levels. It's a funny comedy, with great special effects and although it's slightly altered from its comic book origins, it still leaves a memorable impression.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Can't Make The Scene If You Don't Have The Green...,"Another disappointing movie from when I was younger that just doesn't stand the test of time. Much like Ace Ventura, this movie was a vehicle for Jim Carrey to show off his unbridled craziness wrapped around a thinly veiled plot. Unlike Ace Ventura, it just isn't that funny. It feels like the entire movie is just trying too hard and it falls short in every way. Its primary virtue was giving the world Cameron Diaz. It's not like she is the greatest actor in the history of cinema but she did tend to choose good projects throughout her career and was one of the most bankable stars for a long period of time. Overall, I would skip this one in favor of Carrey's other 1994 offering Dumb and Dumber, which in my humble opinion, is one of the best comedies of all time.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A Candy-Coated 1990s Madcap Patchwork,"I guess the reason why I liked this movie so much as a kid can't be safely detached enough from the reason why I found it so pleasant revisiting it on a whim. So I'll just get it out of the way now: Yes, I still get choked up when Stanley's dog Milo cries for him outside of the jail. OK? There. But it's not just that. It's that this dog, really named Max, is not just a prop; he's a bona fide character. Few movies have taken it upon themselves to really give the dog something interesting to do, but this dog not only emotes to tear jerking effect but also performs exciting unexpected feats, following the bad guys' car, intercepting the mask from the bad guys, all done to please an audience of children, of course, but nonetheless done exceedingly well to that end.The opening shots of The Mask give the impression they were recovered from a distraughtly shoestring 1950s sci-fi movie. Marine salvage operations bring about the breakage of an antiquated trunk that's lay for lifetimes on the bottom of the cove, and a peculiar wooden mask drifts to the surface. Shortly thereafter, unhappy bank teller Stanley Ipkiss, an amiable geek played by Jim Carrey, is gazing into the murky waters after a frenzied night of embarrassments. When he glimpses the mask drifting with some debris, he for some inexplicable reason thinks it's a man in trouble and jumps in to save him. All he retrieves is the mask.Metamorphoses are naturally the heart of comic literature. Billy Batson yells ""Shazam,"" Clark Kent scurries into a phone booth, Bruce Wayne slides down the pole, and invariably an inconsequential pushover befits a comic-strip hero. No wonder pubescent kids react to these stories so fiercely. Think about what happens to Stanley when he dons the mask. He's instantly changed into a delirious cyclone of aggravated liveliness, clad in a banana-yellow zoot suit, a intersection congealing the Joker, Aladdin's genie, and rudiments of The Shadow.One of the crucial design choices must've entailed the Mask character's makeup. It renovates Carrey's facial appearance into a much bigger, comic-bookish caricature, while all at once the facade is still able to authentically move. The effect is a movie character who appears half genuine, half comic strip. And director Chuck Russell is up to utilizing special effects to shift easily between what might be possible and what is unquestionably not, as the Mask spins like a fast-tempo jazz hydrometer and gleefully triumphs in circumstances that would've overwhelmed poor Stanley.The plot starts with luckless Stanley utterly smitten with statuesque client Tina Carlyle, Cameron Diaz's debut. She trifles with him in the bank while taking clandestine videotape of the vault for her boss, the violent Dorian Tyrel (a quite well cast Peter Greene), who manages the Coco Bongo Club, where, sure enough, Tina's the catlike diva. The plot otherwise features Richard Jeni as Charlie, Stanley's sounding board, who familiarizes him with the charades of the Coco Bongo Club; Peter Riegert as a cop who notes the Mask's tie lookss to be of the same cloth as Stanley's unbelievable pajamas; and Milo, Stanley's dog, who's no less than as cunning as his master.It's also this manic energy and 1990's madcap patchwork that holds together a narrative that is every trace as imitative and baseless as it can be. The art design on the movie goes for the loudest possible 1940s film noir aspects of plenty of superhero comics, and the Coco Bongo Club seems reprocessed from Criss Cross or Out of the Past. Stanley's apartment looks like an adolescent boy's bedroom; all that's lacking is a sign on the outside of the door saying ""No Girls Allowed!"" The appearance of the film is as much entertainment as anything else. It's been alleged that one of the crucial traits of an actor is a capacity to share the delight he takes in his performance. You could say The Mask was anchored in that.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Comedy Classic,"The mask is a film for me that i like as much now as much as i did when i was a kid, but considering i'm really just a massive man-child it is to be expected. The film really being the perfect setup for Jim Carrey's comedy styling's.The plot follows Stanley Ipkiss, a typical working scrub. Who finds a Mask which turns him into a egotistical Cartoon character essentially. Who causes the ire of the local gangster. Jim Carrey leads the film fantastically, the zany nature of the story and his acting give the a comic book feel, giving it a timeless quality. The humour at times being very childlike, but at times having a real edge to it. The villain Dorian Tyrell played by Peter Greene is quite a ridiculous character in a lot of ways, with so many poor henchmen around him. But Greene does some how get over this and makes him pretty intimidating.The film also has Cameron Diaz possibly at her sexiest with a great entrance in to the movie, and Milo the dog contending with Carrey with some very funny moments. Things i did not quite like were the attempts at comedy involving the cops. I did like Peter Riegert cynical detective, but his inept partner was just plain annoying.A great film to take you back to your childhood and remind you how funny Jim Carrey can be.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Truly Jim Carrey's Finest Work,"First off, let me say that Jim Carrey is probably my favorite actor of all-time. I've enjoyed him in a lot of his movies, like Ace Ventura, Dumb & Dumber, and Liar Liar, but none of them are quite like The Mask. This brilliant script has everything, 1940's gangster movie suspense, silent film slapstick, and classic Looney Tunes inspired antics all thrown into a blender. The CGI effects, make-up, and costumes are all fantastic, but what is also amazing is that Jim Carrey is pretty much playing two separate characters in the same movie. He does his usual wacky shtick as The Mask but he also plays a sympathetic hero as Stanley Ipkiss. The beautiful music is just icing on the cake. Without a doubt, The Mask is a comedic masterpiece. This will always be my favorite Jim Carrey movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Timeless film,"Initial Impression:""The Mask"" (1994) emerges as a cinematic experience that is both striking in terms of acting and humorously engaging. From the first viewing, the film sets a vibrant tone that combines elements of comedy, crime, and a touch of romantic intrigue, powered by Jim Carrey's iconic performance.Positive Aspects:Jim Carrey's Performance: Carrey's portrayal of Stanley Ipkiss and The Mask is nothing short of legendary. His elastic facial expressions, impeccable timing, and physical comedy elevate the film, making it a memorable watch.Costume and Special Effects: The Mask's costume design is iconic, capturing the essence of the character's exaggerated comic book origins. The special effects were ahead of their time, pushing the boundaries of visual comedy and contributing significantly to the film's appeal.Technical Execution: The cinematography is commendable for its clarity and inventive use of angles, such as long shots, medium close up shots, overhead and worm-eye view shots, that add a dynamic visual flair to the storytelling. The practical effects, such as thunder, rain, and lightning, are skillfully done to elevate the film's comic book vibe.Sound and Music: The film's soundtrack and sound effects play a pivotal role in setting the tone. The goofy sound effects and engaging jazz music complement the film's atmosphere perfectly, contributing to its unique charm.Casting and Characters: The casting choices are spot on. With each actor, also those who had small roles, brought depth to their roles. The inclusion of Mr. Ipkiss's dog adds a delightful layer to the narrative, showcasing not just cuteness but also cleverness.Direction: The direction successfully captures the film's essence, maintaining a flow that feels neither rushed nor sluggish.Mixed Elements:Storytelling: Watching this film today, the film's storytelling occasionally dips into clichés (including police things). However, these moments are often redeemed through humor and visual creativity. Some viewers may find these tropes predictable and detracting from the film's originality. Nevertheless, this specific film is timeless and it was made in 1994!Conclusion:""The Mask"" stands out as a distinctive blend of comedy, and acting performance. Jim Carrey's performance is the undeniable highlight, supported by strong technical execution, and some fun and jazzy music. While the film does navigate through familiar territory with its use of clichés, it is mostly entertaining and humorously engaging. The special effects and animation in The Masks showcase remarkable creativity, establishing the film as an exceptional piece of cinematic history.Rating: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"A brilliant, wild ride","This is one of the most exuberant, wild comedies ever, with Jim Carrey turning in one of the most absolute comic performances ever seen on screen. Sure, there's the make-up to help him along, but it's all nothing without his incredible body language (yeah, I know he doesn't really hop around like that) and his Carrey-esquire ability to push each gesture to the limit without violating the viewer's confidence in Carrey's underlying intelligence. Cameron Diaz's entrance must be one of the most amazing film debuts in history and, being a terrific actress anyway, she sustains the impact throughout. The supporting cast is great,especially Peter Greene in the critical role of Dorian, Nancy Fish as Carrey's landlady, and Richard Jeni as Stanley's buddy. What really elevates this film beyond simply being a great star-vehicle is - well, actually, a few things. The sets are suggestive of ""Edge City"" - the name of the city in the movie - but nothing like the wasteland of Robocop or the Gothic urban-scapes of Batman. Sometimes, understatement works better - the movie has a comic book element to it, of course, but the sets themselves, while hinting at a sinister zeitgeist, don't fall into comic book sensibility. But the element that raises this to a 10, for me, is that it's simply a very well-told story with a great script. It's filmed tight, things make sense emotionally, the pacing is varied and compelling, and one cares about Stanley (Carrey) and Tina (Diaz) from the beginning of the movie. I am surprised at the rating this film receives from IMDb'ers - I would have thought it'd be higher. But maybe it's because recent first-time viewers are used to Carrey and Cameron, and even the tone of the movie itself. I saw it when it came out with one of my kids, and have watched it numerous times thereafter with them - and by myself as well. Catching 10 minutes of it on TV is still a treat some nights.

This Mask-A-Rave,"I've always had a soft spot for this fantasy superhero movie possibly born of my lifelong love of superhero comic books. It was the movie that established Jim Carrey as a box-office star and it was fitting that the Ace Ventura star should have a super-loyal and resourceful pet beagle coming to his aid in this movie too.The film was also notable for introducing to the public at large Cameron Diaz and it has to be said she makes a big impression. Sexy and sassy, you almost suspect watching the movie that her part as the gangster's moll was increased given the splash she makes, possibly at the expense of the other actress in a prominent female part as the two-timing newspaper reporter.The special effects throughout are terrific mixing cartoon animation with expected super-hero-type action. There's a fun narrative which flows quickly and naturally from the origin sequence as we see The Mask attempt to take down a warring gang of robbers.But what really carries the film, for me, is the humour, be it the numerous catchphrases The Mask drops, his string of one-liners which recall the Batman TV series of the mid-60's and his interactions with both the bungling police and the interfering mobsters.One thing I also approved of in retrospect was that it wasn't the subject of at least an immediate movie sequel, which one can easily imagine, especially the way super:hero movies have gone subsequently, leaving this as a delightful one-shot, always good for a second or third viewing.This Mask isn't slipping!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Carrey's comic masterpiece,"It would go without saying that this is one of Jim Carrey's most memorable movies, and with just that in mind, it makes sense that so many people like this.There's a lot to enjoy about this movie: the movie itself is good and doesn't take itself too seriously, (the largest indicator of this being that there are several cartoon references and likenesses) and while being full of action, it's also quite funny.The story is enjoyable and comes to a decisive end... but I won't spoil it for anybody who hasn't seen it. (Yeah, like anyone hasn't.) The fact that it was nominated for a Razzie doesn't matter; many people like surreal movies, and this is truly one of the best... if not the definitive best.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"A perfect combination of humour, action and implausibility","I had a very fun time with this. The performances from Jim Carrey, Cameron Diaz and Peter Greene were exceptional.Also the transformation scenes from being a mundane bank clerk to the ostentacious masked figure was a superb experience and the fact he had this nefarious side to him was a very nice change from becoming some sort of superhero.As said before the movie is hilarious and the action scenes are visually satisfying with the innovative use of weaponry adding to the visual experience due to the masked character.A very fun ride",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
There is no one in this universe like the one and only Jim Carrey.,"Literally, only Jim Carrey could do this role and no one else. His persona, style of humor, and screen presence cannot be replaced or done in the same way by another living soul. Some may rate this low because they find it silly and ridiculous but I found it quite entertaining, creative, and hilarious! I feel like it's a good family movie that both adults and kids can find funny! I would recommend this movie even if the effects don't quite hold up anymore, it's convincing enough and you sometimes just have to roll with the time when the movie came out! It's hard to believe that the 2005 sequel is more silly than this but I'm sure they found ways to accomplish it!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

"An endearing triumph of humour, style and heart","Giant yellow hats off to Chuck Russell. It's easy to see how many ways this film could've gone wrong, but the commitment to quality is obvious in every single scene. The rubbery, one-of-a-kind effects, stylish art deco setting and vintage comic book vibrance create a terrific atmosphere, and the fact that it's all played so straight might be why it works as well as it does. Peter Riegert's Dt. Kelloway, Peter Greene's Dorian Tyrell and the rest of the mobsters never seem like they'd be out of place in a ""serious"" '90s crime drama, so seeing them all get caught up in the Mask's cartoonish exploits is a sight to behold.The excellent supporting cast, including the late, great Richard Jeni, Cameron Diaz' debut performance, Ben Stein at his deadpan best and the superbly emotive dog Milo round out every scene with something great. At the end of the day, the film is, of course, Jim Carrey's, and his stunning comic antics as the Mask are surprisingly rivaled by his Stanley Ipkiss. It's a role he fills with one compelling touch after another, each subtle expression as impressive as his wildest face-pulls. The earnestness with which he embodies what so many of us frequently feel like - a nice guy just desperate to unleash their inner Jim Carrey - is perhaps The Mask's most impressive spectacle.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

Iguana instead of the dog,"Jim Carrey has a pet in the film. It is a dog named Milo. He is similar to an actor. Milo like his owner, is shy, sweet, kind and loyal to him. But what if it was an iguana like the one in the IguVerse project, instead of the dog. I think it would be an appropriate pet too. The Iguana has its own character which no animal has. For example, this kind of animal is very strict in emotions. It is a very calm and empathetic pet. Maybe it is not so vigorous like a dog or other domestic pet, but to see it in the film would be impressive. Fancy, if the iguana takes on the mask it will be a mini-Godzilla. It would be more interesting to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

A movie for everyone,"I disagree with the other reviewer, when I first saw this movie I was 16 and I thought it was brilliant. I am 22 now and I still like it. The only reason you should avoid this movie is if you dislike Jim Carrey's style of overacting and being silly (I know some do). Otherwise he is great in this and without him I don't think the concept would work at all. There is a balance of story with all the comedy and while it isn't a life changing movie it is fun and well made, the effects are great for a film of it's age and stand up OK even 10 years later. The characters are ideal, the two detectives are the perfect double act and Cameron Diaz is both incredibly beautiful and talented in her first big role. In summary, I think adults can enjoy the silliness and the comedy as much the kids and the plot, acting and effects knit the whole lot together really well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

It really allows Carey to show his face.Now on to Diaz.  She is a KNOCKOUT in this movie.  I have rarely seen anybody so beautiful.  She was even more beautiful in There's Something About Marry.

Non-stop fun,"Seeing this film for the first time back in 1994, unaware of its roots in Tex Avery's cartoons and such made a lasting effect on me. Jim Carrey is in top form in this fast-paced package of laughs, action and great music (the sequence at the Coco Bongo Club stands in my opinion as one of the greatest and funniest musical performances caught on film).But let's not forget the colorful visuals and beautiful, on-the-spot photography, that really makes this film shine.

Good taste and originality make this kiddy tale a winner,"A must for all people between 10 and 14 years, the mask is the ultimate story of the dream come true. But although this movie could have been buried in a shallow and not so interesting story, this one manages to stand out from the rest. Why? First of all, when I saw this one I thought that I was seeing something new. The main title is dazzling, with Randy Edelman's rousing music score (I would give anything to have the cd) filling our ears, and a heavenly theme accompanying the mask in its ascent to the surface. Edge city is a crime-filled place, but manages to be a beautiful sight. Cameron Diaz is a revelation. The humor is out of this world. And when I saw this one as a kid I wished to have that power to be whoever I wanted to. Jim Carrey has in Stanley Ipkiss an even better role than Truman Burbank. The same goes to Cameron Diaz, who is the perfect bombshell. The CGI is also jaw-dropping and eye-popping (literally). I loved all those little touches that made this movie a great ride. And I would love to have that movie score, Randy Edelman: please release a cd!!!A question, however: what the hell happened to the sequel? Cartoon Network was having a contest and the prize was seeing the shooting of ""The Mask 2"", but many years later, not a sequel in sight... why does this happen?

He shows, I believe, why he is one of the best comedic actors around today, he seems to have no boundaries and is so full of energy he could make your head spin, but they're good things! This film also introduced the world to Cameron Diaz, and what an intro!! She doesn't really shine in this film, but as her first, was probably never expected to do so, she's a nice bit of eye candy for the guys, and I'm sure they don't mind!

Light movie version of a pitch-dark comic,"I first met The Mask as a comic, a violent, even revolting comic. I had to read it is small doses, because the violence was too extreme for my taste.As a movie, it is totally different. That is usually a bad sign, most movies that changes the concept so much fail to tell a good story, but when The Mask gets a less violent script and Carrey's incredible rubber face combined with cartoon-style special effects (and pretty good acting in between), the result is that the humor gets a lot stronger.In the comic, Ipkiss murders his old teacher with a book down her throat, and the car service men are slaughtered in similar ways. In the movie, we see one of the car service guys in pain, but he obviously survives. When the comic Ipkiss slaughters dozens of policemen, the movie version merely teases them. And it is much easier to laugh at.And the movie is great fun. No wonder it made Carrey a superstar. I have seen many of his movies, and this is one of the very best. Other favorites, ""Bruce almighty"" and ""Truman show"" are in many ways logical successors.The original story misuses our Norse god Loki as bad as US people always seem to do. Americans seem to be unable to understand Loki, so they use him as a devil or a demon, which is completely wrong. But the movie is more bent to mischief than slaughter, so the movie makes a big step in the right direction.Something that disturbs me is the bad guy Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene) and the plot around him. He is a flat, standard mobster, and his part seems like something that was slapped on because the original ending was too horrible for the movie. But let me also say that the actors do their job well. I just feel that the standard gangster plot feels cheap.So the mobster plot was a disappointment in an otherwise very funny and worthwhile movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

I was happy to see him in Sonic the Hedgehog though and I heard he has return focus on acting again, so Im excited about that too.

Jim Carrey IS The Mask,The Mask was made for Jim Carrey. Even though he had some good work before this movie I think he really got popular during the Mask/Ace Ventura era. His cartoonish and expressive style of comedy really stood out. The movie is based on a cartoon and really feels like one too. Anything goes. We're also introduced to other stars like Cameron Diaz. I remember when they would promote this movie they milked the heck out of that shot where she walks into the bank. I would see it everywhere. I think she played the role well as the girlfriend of the bad guy who still feels like a real meanie to this day. It sometimes feels a bit out of place. The very realistic feeling and harsh bad guy in a somewhat cartoonish Universe but I guess the point was to show Stanley is the exact opposite. Peter Greene played the bad guy well.What I really didn't notice when I first watched but now is that the dog Milo was pretty talented. They had him doing all kinds of trick that he did with ease with the right expressions. It was the movie The Mask that made me want to have a dog.One of Jim Carrey's best movies.,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"I've been laughing, but for some reason, it's sad","""Comedy is a mask in Kim ·Carrey's closet in Hollywood, but the face inside the mask is still the desperate child from Canada."" In the movie, Stanley, who does not wear a mask, is timid and cautious, and he is cynical and almost crazy when he wears a mask at night, but Jim Carrey can switch at will under the two almost opposite characters, and he can do it easily, but he does not lose his measure. And Kim · Carrey is like the man under the mask in reality. Despite wearing a mask, he is the king of comedy, but when he takes off the mask, he is a patient with depression. Behind the glamorous, there is always some bitterness and sadness. He did his best to bring laughter to others, but he went further and further in his own shadow.He is Kim · Carrey, a comedy king alongside Stephen Chow.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

One of Jim Carrey's best performances!,"Oooh, what a Jim Carrey classic! The Mask is one of my favorite '90s comedies. Jim Carrey effortlessly shines in his renowned physical comedy range with wacky impressions of pop culture figures. He is sublime in the dual role of pushover Stanley Ipkiss and charming, confident playboy while wearing the supernatural green mask, allowing him to express and fulfill his innermost, screaming desires and act as his fully uninhibited self, his alter ego. I love the cartoon-like, Tex Avery-inspired action and practical/judicious use of computerized visual effects. The jokes, one-liners, and even the sarcastic, cynical humor from Peter Riegert's lieutenant character are all hilarious. I like his and Cameron Diaz's sweet chemistry. They make an adorable on-screen couple. I think Diaz does an awesome job in her debut film role as Tina Carlyle. The pacing is great. The villain/bad guy is formidable. The music choices are fantastic. The direction of this film is wonderful. A sure-fire comedy classic. I love LOVE the casino nightclub dance scene where Diaz and Carrey's (in his mask form) characters dance together in tandem, just a STUNNING, ICONIC scene.

Stand out movie,"It had all the elements of a great movie i.e. interesting storyline, clear focus & direction, easy to follow, great characters & engaging. At times, I also found it hilarious to the point I was literally laughing out loud.
In particular - Jim Carey nailed his role, and I think it's the best movie he has done (although - I've watched most of his movies, bar a few). I also think that Cameron Diaz did well too. Overall - you know it's a great movie when you can re-watch it, and still greatly enjoy it every time.

Jim Carrey doing what he's best at,"Another movie which showcases Jim Carrey's ability to elicit laughs with comic antics and bodily contortions. Whether special effects were needed is questionable, given Carrey's apparent ability to twist and turn his body and face into all kinds of positions. Even disregarding Carrey's comical talent, this movie stands on its own. The special effects and dialogue, though crass and cheesy sometimes, are a big hit in this kind of movie.

the way the mask speaks to me in july 2002,"Looking back at a film largely forgotten by the general moviegoing public years ago, I notice there is something about the mask that really represents a different style of creativity when it comes to the art of computer generated special effects. A critic of movies should take another look at this movie and notice the drastic ways the use of computer generated special effects has spiraled out of control. Films nowaday have muddled the true entertainment of special effects with lavish overproduction. When an entire city is digitally created and zoomed through with a free range 3d camera it is not the same as when 3D effects and live action play off of each other naturally. In The Mask Jim Carrey becomes a god, he can do anything he wants to do, bend the true elements of reality around him, and his insanity is brought to life with the use not even MILDLY TASTEFUL visual effects. These special effects are over the top, but they are not RIDICULOUS. Reality is getting cheapened by computer generated graphics. Any movie can have good special effects. Mortal Kombat, Annihilation had great special effects, so did Lost in Space. Those are horrible, horrible movies. Take me back to the days with movies were tasteful, subtle, subversive, extreme, calculated. Movies like Road to Perdition and the upcoming Gangs of New York are looking interesting, but still there is a flood of mainstream brainpan droppings that start sucking out your lifeforce as soon as you start to stare into their idiot void and don't stop until you're out 8.50 are contaminating the market and putrifying American cinema.

One of my personal favorites as a child and still love it as a young adult!,"OK, I never read the comics this was based on, but in terms of judging a comic-book movie adaptation on it's own merits, I used to watch this a few more time as a little child at the mid-90s when it was released and I loved it as much as anyone else in this website even as a young adult. Sure, it may not be the best movie, but I've seen much much worse films and I think that this is one of Jim Carrey's best films in my opinion next to Liar Liar and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.The story is pretty engaging and has some of my favorite moments throughout the film (the casino scene, the dancing sequence, the balloon animals, and the quotes ""Somebody Stop Me!"" and more), the script's humorous and made me laugh really hard, the special effects are the epitome of greatness, and the music is good, but the strongest aspect goes to the cast especially Jim Carry which I like the best and I liked his personality (going from a mild-mannered person to a wild and crazed superhero).

Interesting to note that he did this, 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' and 'Dumb and Dumber' (which I gotta see at some point!) all in 1994 - quite the year! Peter Greene and Peter Riegert are also involved, though it's very much the debuting Cameron Diaz that is the best of the rest behind Carrey.Apparently this had a sequel released in 2005, 'Son of the Mask'.

Hero in a Mask? I,"The hero, stanley epcis, hope I spelled that right, is a banker. He is quite a cartoon fan with a dog, which I believe is the most adorable, bright creature I've ever seen. Then he met this woman and the story starts to run.Its basically it. But what made this a good view is its comical ways and I meant it to be both figuratively and literally. Jim Carrey takes up the figurative part. I think he is the best in this regard, for what I've seen so far in years, ever. The Literal part will be about the effects and animation and it is impressive. To make guns move so real but you know it doesn't spin like that in reality, and that is the amazing part, considering the time in its production.The ending, you will find it predictable but the story though important, not quite the only factor that makes this good. Though there is a sudden twist in it. The good was stupid and turned out bad and the beautiful and enemy turned out a trusted ally.The hoola, hoo, holla! was the best of my watch. The choreography with exaggerated movements we know Jim Carry carry out so well was superb. The coco bango, yah! Well, this isn't turning out to be a good, intelligent review. Let's resume then...The music and dance routines. There were many of them. Quite the jiggle and before you'd know it, a smile is painted in your lips and laugh out loud. It is super comical and unreal, and it's obvious this would never happen even if it was the common reaction of talking and walking, but it is part of the goodness of the movie.Obviously, I've enjoyed the movie, of re-watch and year 2015.

The Best Jim Carey Movie By Far,"I have never been a Jim Carey fan, i have always thought that in his movies he is trying too hard to be funny, acting way over the top, trying to play a cartoon character by himself; for me it doesn't work, but THE MASK is something totally different, because you are watching Jim Carey as a cartoon character, with large teeth and a make up that just by watching him it would make you laugh.Now this character is really a great vehicle for Jim Carrey to make his show, and this times it works more than perfect.This movie made me laugh a lot, and the wonderful thing is that THE MASK is not overused, making his appearances more enjoyable.My Jim Carrey favorite by far. ""Tell Scarlett I do give a damn"", ""Jet' adore, jet' adore, jet' wind, i don't care"" 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Not Jim Carrey's best but a pretty good movie all up.,"Now, I know this movie is known as the movie Jim Carrey restricts himself unless of course he is wearing the mask. The movie is about Stanley Ipkiss a hopeless man bored with being an unlucky dork, he finds a masks that makes him an extra hypo coll guy. The movie is definitely not Carrey's best but is a must watch for fans of his other films. Now this movie is one of those unfortunate movies that has triggered a series and a sequel which I did not find that bad but now has its own place in the worst 100 movies. Overall watch this movie if you want to laugh but I would choose Ace Ventura over it any day. I rate this movie 78%.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
The total amount of laughs and excitement added up earns this an 8/10 in my book,"I was just under eight years old when ""The Mask"" was released, but I probably heard about it around then. I also first saw the film probably as early as 1995, though I'm not sure if I saw the whole thing. My clearest memory of that experience is the scene where Jim Carrey puts the mask on and says, ""It's party time!"" I saw it again a few years later, in my early teens (left with a clearer memory of it that time), and have seen it twice within the past couple years. I may not have enjoyed the second viewing of the two QUITE as much as the first, but it at least came close, and was still a lot better than the last Jim Carrey movie I watched, ""Liar Liar"".Stanley Ipkiss is a shy bank clerk who is easily pushed around and can't seem to ever be romantically successful. However, after one unlucky day, he finds a mysterious mask floating in the water near the bridge! He takes it back to his apartment with him, where he tries it on, and it magically turns him into a crazy, powerful, tough, aggressive, green-headed alter ego, The Mask! He doesn't know this at first, but this mask is an ancient one that represents Loki, the Norse night god of mischief! As the Mask, the bank clerk begins to wreak havoc in the corridor, and then outside, where he scares off a bunch of street thugs! He then wakes up the next morning, thinking it was all a dream, but he is wrong! After this, he continues to put the mask on at night, and tends to have better luck than he did before he found it, including his luck with romance, winning the heart of his love interest, Tina Carlyle. However, nobody in the city knows who's behind this mask, and since Stanley tends to cause trouble with it on, the police are after him. Not only that, he also finds the local mob after him!The last time I watched this 1994 blockbuster, a couple nights ago, I certainly didn't find it consistently hilarious, and it took a little while for it to really pick up. The first REALLY funny part I found was when Stanley Ipkiss' borrowed car falls apart just before he finds the mask. After that, there are quite a few very funny, sometimes hilarious moments thanks to Ipkiss' green alter ego, including the part where he pretends he's dying in a mobster's arms. The Mask is a rather silly character, but that doesn't mean not funny. The humour still isn't as consistent as I had hoped, and the scene where Stanley, with his mask on, forcing everyone around to dance may be a bit overlong. However, it's not entirely the humour that's making me give ""The Mask"" an 8/10. It also gets suspenseful at times, especially towards the end. So, I couldn't rate this film any more than a 7 if it relied entirely on humour for its entertainment value, but with the humour AND adrenaline combined, I think an 8 is more like it. Also, something I got out of this film that I obviously wouldn't have back in the mid-nineties is Cameron Diaz, who is so hot here in the role of Tina Carlyle!""The Mask"" is not the greatest comedy ever made, and Jim Carrey's antics are not always funny, but they usually work, unlike in ""Liar Liar"", where his silly voices, sounds, etc. got on my nerves a bit. Here, his character's alter ego is an amusing one, and is a lot like a cartoon character, so it's not much of a surprise that this movie spawned an animated series, which brings back memories, as I saw some episodes of that cartoon during its fairly brief run and enjoyed them. If you can't stand Carrey as a comedian in general, then I'm sure his performance here would be no exception to you in this film. On the other hand, for Jim Carrey fans (or those who SOMETIMES find him funny), who want a comedy, action, and fantasy adventure, this successful blockbuster from fourteen years ago could easily turn out to be an entertaining experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

excellent comedy of 1994,"""The Mask"" it is a movie that causes to see and to see as many times as be necessary to stay happy, it is that Jim Carrey is excellent comic actor, and its performance in this movie, like in the other comic movie of 1994 (Dumb and Dumber) they have taken it to the fame that today in day has.Other comic movies as ""Bruce Almighty"", ""Dumb and Dumber"", ""Ace Ventura Pet Detective"" they are others that should be in our collection of comic classics, and as an user he/she said somewhere around in their comment: ""1994, year of good movies"", ""1994 Jim Carrey's year"", I say that he's right, and I hope that the stupid sequels that ruin the original spirit of the movies like ""Son of the Mask"" they stop to be carried out.P.S. Another attraction of this movie is Tina (Cameron Díaz), first movie where I see it, and that it is its sensual stereotype that has not had in other movies (perhaps in ""The Sweetest Thing"").",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Favorite Carrey movie except......,"Why couldn't they have picked anyone else, but Diaz. Could have picked at least a pretty actress versus butter-face.

Ssssssmokin!,"After hitting it big with the incredibly goofy but incredibly funny Ace Ventura, Jim Carrey knocks it out of the park on an even bigger scale with The Mask. A huge part of what makes the film so good is its innovative use of CGI. Sure, the effects never look real, but that's precisely the point, seeing how the Mask is basically a live action cartoon character and operates entirely on cartoon logic. As a result, the scenes involving him lead to an endless number of quotable lines and hilarious moments. Personal favorites include him arriving in a super long limo, acting out an overly dramatic death scene before accepting an award onscreen, and his hysterical reaction to facing an army of cops. All that, plus two fantastic dance scenes set to the endlessly catchy ""Hey Pachuko"" and ""Cuban Pete"". Thankfully, even though the Mask has only like 25 minutes of screentime, the rest of the film is still really well done. It's perfectly paced, the first 17 minutes do a great job of establishing everything and setting up future gags, and there are still plenty of funny moments, like when Stanley's junker loaner car literally falls apart on him.Jim Carrey truly hits his stride here. As the Mask, he is his usual energetic, goofy, over the top self, working in tandem with the effects to create this wannabe Looney Tune. On the other hand, he gives a more laid back and charming performance as Stanley, more reserved but also with his fair share of silly moments. Richard Jeni gets some good laughs as Stanley's friend. Peter Riegert makes for a great foil to Carrey and he and James Doughan are a very funny duo. Even the not so funny characters are great; Peter Greene is a solid villain and Cameron Diaz is a likeable love interest. Funnily enough, arguably the best performance comes not from a human but from Stanley's dog, who's as adorable as he is clever and funny.Overall, The Mask may very well be my favorite Jim Carrey film. It's not necessarily his best film; that's debatably The Truman Show. But, it's the film I probably come back to the most, quote the most, and most importantly, laugh at the most.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Totally Awesome,"I was much younger than I am now when this film was released in 1994, but it has been a favorite since. I always did like Jim Carrey, and this was only the second film of his I saw. And this film was a starting point in Cameron Diaz's career.The acting in the film was moderate, with Jim Carrey being his exceptionally funny self, and Cameron Diaz stealing the scenes. It was hard to picture Amy Yasbeck as a backstabbing reporter who broke her silence about the Mask.It was good to see by the end that Jim Carrey threw the Mask away and got the girl. It was an excellent film, one in which thrust Diaz into super stardom. And Jim Carrey's popularity was thrust into the stratosphere with this film. The start of his major career.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Vigorous and enjoyable fantasy,"Unlucky banker Stanley Ipkiss (Carrey) discovers a mask in a river that gives him superpowers at night.The film that launched Cameron Diaz into our hearts and lives is also one of the more forgotten Jim Carrey masterpieces of slapstick comedy.When son of the mask was released 5 years ago it was slated as destroying the original concept of this film and ruining the family entertainment value of cinema and whereas plans for a sequel were originally thought up in the 90's this is a film best left alone as a sheer conceptual mind blast.Opening with an attempt at cementing some mystical origin, a scuba diver uncovers a case where the mask floats away and our adventure begins.Converting to the interior of an average bank we see Carrey's ordinary Joe conversing with a friend about concert tickets and is attire and laid back attitude instantly recognises as a push over who has no romantic socialism. Therefore cue a fresh face to give the film a far fetched romantic premise and we have a new star on our screens.Cameron Diaz, shot in one of the best making career openings ever (Megan Fox has nothing on this) director Chuck Russell chooses a soaking 20 something Diaz walking through the door before cutting back to Richard Jeni's beautifully spoken ""Hold the phone"" before switching back to the entrance and zooming in and then up to allow Diaz flicking her hair and walking confidently and purposefully towards the two star struck bankers. A moment of pure genius and idolism. As far as performances go, Diaz certainly generates the right mood for this picture, being perfectly innocent and charming, a figure looking for friendship and love, and the American certainly chances her own splendid dancing and witty humour. Whilst her comedy persona has improved through films such as My best friend's wedding this was a film that begun her road to stardom.Choosing a normal average bored character in day to day rota Carrey expands on the conventional through true wacky styling when the mask is in place. There are occasions when there is an over step of eccentric portrayal, on the park bench for example, but the majority has viewers siding with his spontaneous mischievousness. Not to forget Carrey is able to capitalise on the script through splendid catchphrases and facial expressions.The script itself is a good vs evil eventuality that adds some spice and tension in the final third whilst constantly having us smiling and laughing along with the array of familiar villains and good guys.A quick mention of the score by Randy Edelman which has a way of capturing the moment of vivaciousness perfectly whilst being sentimental when required.It may have flaws of over exuberance and a formula of eventual outcome but this is a joyous ride of passion and vigour that is certainly worth catching as a reminder of Carrey's brilliance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Pure Jim At His Most Zaney,"I've forgotten how Disney-style animated this was. This was a lot like ""Roger Rabbit"". I also had no idea this was Cameron Diaz's debut and she had absolutely zero prior acting experience.""The Mask"" was a huge movie when it came out. Jim Carrey in his prime staring in a strange movie about a timid banker who finds a mask in river that once worn it attaches itself and gives the person a bold, lively and confident personality in a literal cartoonist appearance. This spectacle and the connection between The Mask and attractive Cameron Diaz, a woman that when maskless Stanley is a bundle of nerves around, completely overshadows the underlying plot of local gangsters who want him dead. There are many memorable scenes but the style of The Mask will live on forever. This is a Jim Carrey and Cameron Diaz classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

It isn't easy being Green.,"The legend of 'The Mask', exits for fun on the screen, but was for real for Jim Carrey.'The Mask' is all Jim Carrey, and in my opinion at least, shows Jim Carrey at his most talented best. Carrey has made many films since 'The Mask', but nothing 'unleashes' him as this film does.Cameron Diaz ('the girl'), Peter Green ('the bad guy'), Peter Reigert and Jim Doughan (Bumbling Detectives) all support Carrey in this highly imaginative, comical, special effects loaded (Oscar nominated) totally fun movie.See it for sure, and you'll see that Chuck Russell (Director) , Michael Fallon and Mark Verheiden (writers) have earned a place in cinema classic comedy with 'The Mask', a comedy for all ages.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

one of Jim Carrey's masterpiece~,"If you get a wonderful mask which can hide your face? your character? If it makes your character change as you want? In this movie, one mask changed Ipkiss's characters. Ipkiss, who is timid and coward, became new person. He could do anything that he wanted whether it is a legal thing or illegal thing. He came to know that Tina that Ipkiss likes was the girl of gangster Dorian, Dorian got angried perfectly because he kissed with Tina. After that, there were many fighting between Ipkiss and Dorian and finally, Ipkiss has won. Everybody who feels boring about their life at least think something to be a hero as well as most hero movie. It is expressed in the movie. Want to get out of this boring and simple life. Want to be greater one. This movie satisfy the people who think like those. But there is a impressive scene in the last part of the movie; it is that Ipkiss threw the mask away and find his own character by himself. At last, it shows it is just a fiction after all, and makes people realize their life in the same time.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
Wasted Potential,"The concept of ""The Mask"" is very enthralling but this film muddies it with cartoonish cliché nonsense. ""The Mask"" is annoying as all hell and really loses Jim Carrey's absurdist subtlety that he could usually bring. This really has the bones of a solid title but falls flat on one to many fronts to be considered a good film. Don't get me wrong, it's still pretty decent. It's a solid ""turn your brain off"" type movie. It's attempts to hint at a greater meaning usually fall flat and are inconsistent in its messaging. The bad guys are solid but the romantic couple is just so lame, they have some chemistry but not enough for the romance to really be sold.

Carrey's best film,"Don't get me wrong; Carrey's an excellent comic. However, he has made a habit of appearing in terrible movies and almost saving them. This is the exception.The Mask is a comic book movie, something many people are unaware of. Carrey was perfectly cast as the main character: a boring no-name who discovers a magical mask that makes him invulnerable and extremely extroverted. Most of the jokes are directed at teenagers; this is a really funny film for about age 14-25 or so, plus other people who remember the horror of puberty. The humour tends to focus on Ipkiss' attempts to reintegrate the extroverted character into his own life, while trying to clean up the mess that the Mask character tends to leave lying around, and avoid getting killed.If you're a Carrey fan, watch this movie. If you're not, maybe you should anyway. If you passionately hate him, including his standup, then avoid it like the plague.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"

One night while jumping into a river he finds a mask which transforms him into a fun loving character.

For the cartoon lover in us all,"Jim Carrey lets it all out in `The Mask', and he hasn't stopped.  The role seems to be perfect for Carrey, who is famous for being the `rubber-faced' comedian of Hollywood.  In his true breakout role, Carrey plays bank teller Stanley Ipkiss.  We all know people like this: so friendly and nice that they become nothing but doormats and then are too nice to even ask us to stop.  However, after being tossed out of a nightclub one night (and being humiliated in front of his dream girl, played by Cameron Diaz), he finds a mysterious mask floating in the river.  It may seem like an ordinary mask for now, but when Ipkiss puts it on, his inner-self is released.  Finally, he's able to be as free-spirited and cartoon-like as he's always dreamed (we learn early on he's a huge cartoon fan).  He now has the power to do whatever he wanted but not before taking some revenge on those who make him miserable.   I watch this movie for two main characters: Ipkiss and his faithful dog Milo.  When the Mask is on the screen, the audience cheers.  When Milo is on the screen, they cheer even louder.  When Milo puts on the Mask well, you get the idea.As usual, Carrey is an utter delight, letting loose in this role and bending it to his will.  It's this type of comedy that die-hard fans fell in love with, not to mention creating future roles including `Liar Liar', `Me, Myself and Irene', and `Bruce Almighty'.  I still laugh like crazy when Ipkiss puts on the mask.  For the record, if a person is not a fan of cartoons, then they are not going to like this movie.  It includes plenty of references to classic cartoon characters (not to mention a fitting tribute to Tex Avery's Wolf).  I'm an avid cartoon fanatic, so this was a movie that was right up my alley.  If you're an fan of the old animated slapstick, then I recommend this movie with 5 neon stars!  If not well, best try your luck somewhere else.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
"""NO, IT WASN`T ME! IT WAS THE ONE-ARMED MAN!","Yes Mr. Carrey it was you that made us die laughing in this delightfully entertaining film not the one armed man.

Jim Carrey at some of his best,"As you might have read in my ""Liar, Liar"" review, I really like Jim Carrey comedies. I'm not sure if this outdoes LL or not. Anyway, it's a really good movie. It was the film debut of Cameron Diaz. I especially adored the funny Tex Avery cartoons homages they did with the fine CG effects. The mask seems just like the kind of person Jim Carrey would become. It was cool how they would have the shy Stanley Ipkiss at one point, and then he would turn into the zany, funny, wise-cracking mask guy. He is by far, one of the funniest movie characters I've ever seen. There was no stop to it!! My brother used to do impressions of him all the time. Whether it was ""Somebody stop me!!"" or ""Party! P,A,R,T,Y? 'Cuz I have to!!"".Anyway, it's full of memorable gags, like the part where the dog gets the mask and such. This was probably one of the earliest PG-13 movies I remember seeing. It's the same with ""Liar, Liar"". You just can't miss it. I personally think Jim Carrey has kind of lost his good humor in his latest movies, but I'm looking forward to ""Bruce Almighty"".

A fun nostalgic story that never gets old,"It's got some bad actors and a crazy, surreal storyline but that was not enough to prevent critics from certifying it fresh. I actually never knew it was nominated for an Oscar, but rightfully so. The VFX are so bizarre, I haven't seen anything like it, before or after.Like Robert Shaw in Jaws, it's hard to imagine anyone else in this role but Jim Carrey (the same goes for Ace Ventura and Dumb and Dumber). It's a clever, surreal scifi & fantasy comedy that still holds up nearly 30 years after it came out.The score is pretty great too. It has a dark cartoonish tone to it that really adds to the storytelling. I can't quite put my finger on the reason why this gets a 9/10.

Hello,This is a really good film the only problem is its to short and it needed more time with the mask in it. Cant wait for the sequel. Casting was very good with cameron diaz playing the babe shes like so hot. If you've ever seen the mask cartoons its very good this film because it makes it seem like a cartoon but its real actors which is most impressive. Jim carrey was the perfect man for the part. Hope to see him again in the sequel if possible. Cameron Diaz was like sooooo hot in that film. Although shes hot everywhere. Shame Britney wasn't in it or Christina that would of made the film a lot better with those to babes in it. A really good film for 1994 but a hell of a long wait for the sequel. its been 10 years,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
A Lighthearted Comic Strip Movie That Proved to Be Ground-breaking in the Special Effects Department,"I remember watching all the hype before this film came out.  So much attention was plowed into the fact that the special effects made the movie and that you should RUN to the cinema just to see them.  But what they didn't say was that it's a highly entertaining film.  Yes, it's based on a comic strip, and yes Jim Carrey goes looney in it.  But even if you don't like Jim Carrey and hate Cameron Diaz at her gorgeous best, it's still definately worth a look.I saw this film again on DVD 6 years after it's release and I have to say the special effects still are impressive.  That's going to be the thing in the future, whether the special effects can stand the test of time, compared to the old style which you tend to watch now and cringe.  I sit there sometimes at some old films and think ""god I thought this was amazing when it came out"".  I'm happy to say, after my hour of waffling that this is a very enjoyable film.  Go on, rent it!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Crime"
