Guy Ritchie's Hilarious Feature Debut,"This is one seriously funny movie. I've probably seen it close to 10 times and it hasn't gotten old yet. Guy Ritchie brings us a hilarious look into the London criminal underground in one of his earliest features. The story revolves around four friends who become indebted to the local crime lord after a card game goes horribly wrong. The humor in this movie is sharp and fast-paced. At times, it becomes a little hard to keep up with the thick British accents and the cockney rhyming slang but overall, it doesn't detract from the movie. The movie keeps you guessing as to the outcome when the story becomes complex with multiple lies and double-crosses but the ending satisfies.This film marks the debuts of two of England's coolest new actors: Jason Statham (who went on to do 'Transporter', among other movies) and Vinnie Jones (now a familiar cinema tough guy). Jones is especially good as Big Chris, debt collector/family man. The majority of the cast aren't common faces in America (aside from Sting) but they all have the charisma to keep the audience interested. Another plus is the film's soundtrack, ranging from reggae to 70's soul. It adds to the movie's already laid-back feel.Everyone I've seen the movie with enjoys it (once they get past the thick accents, anyway) so I can say with confidence this is a fun movie. I recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy and I feel this movie's humor hits more often than it misses. I'd recommend giving this movie a chance at least once and I don't think you'd be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"The essence of late 90's cinema -- hip, highly stylized, VISUAL","Guy Ritchie's hip, highly stylized 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is a truly remarkable film, not only for its appropriately pyrotechnic camera work, but also for its seemingly flawless, puzzle-perfect script/screenplay. While the picture's main focus is on a group of lads who invest money in a high-stakes, rigged card game and lose, the broader story concerns approximately eight different groups of criminals whose paths cross (more> than once, in some cases) during various illegal pursuits: money, guns, drugs, even revenge. The film is quite violent, both on and off screen, but it's also uniformly humorous throughout. It's important to note that the four central characters (a cook, a card sharp, and a couple of guys who sell ""discounted"" items) are interested only in acquiring the money to pay off their enormous debt; they kill no one. The same applies to the laid-back college boys who ""grow copious amounts of ganja"".The cast is comprised of mostly young, veteran, male actors. In fact, the only female in the film doesn't even speak, though she handles a machine gun fairly well. Sting appears briefly in several scenes as a bar-owning father figure. While his secondary performance is solid, as usual, it is also unmemorable. The soundtrack is first-rate, from the 60's hits of James Brown to the contemporary beats of London's underground. The groovy, pulsating music and lyrics are often succinctly synchronized with the action and dialogue in the film, creating a theatrical rhythm that is fairly uncommon in cinema (from any period).Critics and audiences over the years have often dismissed stylized camera work as pretentious and unnecessary, stating that it detracts from the story, bogs it down, or pads it; however, the film medium has the luxury of actually ""displaying"" a story for its audience, unlike the written word alone. It's what the medium is all about -- it's VISUAL. Hence, one of the reasons a filmmaker chooses such visual displays is to ""brand"" his or her work, in the same way as writers like Cummings, Hemingway or Joyce did with their medium. It's hard to imagine a cinema without Hitchcock, Kubrick, or Scorsese to represent it. To this end, Ritchie has taken his first step in establishing his own brand. His energetic, ultra-contemporary camera work incorporates (through a fresh perspective) such devices as slow motion, fast motion, and freeze-frame coupled with narration. It is at times reminiscent of (and actually expands upon) Martin Scorsese's patented visual stylistics and camera movements, like those found in 'Mean Streets' and 'Goodfellas'. But the similarities with Scorsese's work end there.Critics' endless comparisons of Ritchie's film with the works of Quentin Tarantino and Danny Boyle's 'Trainspotting' stand mostly unwarranted, as these comparisons take away from the inventiveness and originality of 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. Ritchie's film is a much more involved, complex, layered work than the aforementioned comparisons. While Tarantino's films are very strong on dialogue, screenplay, and editing, they often lack creative camera work and direction. Boyle's 'Trainspotting' does have a resembling ""feel"" to 'LS&TSB', but aside from its Great Britain origins, there really is no need for comparison. 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is essential viewing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Have a butchers...,"I was a total and complete sucker for this film.If I were to write and direct a movie about gangsters or crime, this would be it.  I wouldn't change one damn thing.  Not a thing.  Everything in this film was, to my eye, perfect - casting, the camerawork, the excellent dialogue (""It's been emotional."")Now I don't have much to compare this to, and I've heard some criticism that it basically draws quite heavily from older British crime dramas.  I've got a bunch of these on my queue to rent, but I doubt you could make a crime film better than this.This film oozes with style, class, dark humor, plot twists and turns, and doesn't drag one bit.  The casting and characterization is perfect, and Ritchie isn't afraid to move the cameras around; no pretense is really made here at ""realism"" - Ritchie doesn't mask the fact that it's a film and he runs with it.I really don't think of myself as easily impressed, and I have seen a hell of a lot of films in my time, but this one instantly made my Top 10 after only a single viewing.  Yes, I'm raving about it, and while it may not be ""spiritually enriching"" or contain any deep sociological content (which I actually do look for in films), somehow it still scores as one hell of a film; memorable and entertaining, and stands up well to multiple viewings.I am a bit dismayed to see some of the marketing of this film comparing it to other things like Quentin Tarantino films or Trainspotting.  It really does it a disservice because this film really is its own phenomenon and stands on its own two feet; if anything it is similar to  Trainspotting and Tarantino films only because it actually has its own bold style.Can't recommend it enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Pure Bloody Genius,"Guy Ritchie has a skill: the skill to take multi-layered gangster plots, weave them together, and come out with a fabric of the finest quality. I first watched ""Snatch"", which came after this film. Loved it. Watch this film, which had a similar set-up (the interwoven gangster theme). Loved it. As far as I'm concerned, if Ritchie can maintain this level of creativity, he can keep on making these films until the end of time. His characters are so well scripted and the actors so well chosen, there is a three-dimensional quality to this film, as if you can almost taste the sulfur in the shotgun blasts.To describe the plot is difficult, unless we choose one character as the hero and the rest as the anti-heroes... but that's hard to do. While certain people seem to be on our side, they're all equally involved in the plot. Kids playing poker, a porn king who cheats at cards, Big Chris the hired thug, the stereotyped black ganja dealer, Barry the Baptist... all great characters.Another aspect of Ritchie's films is that instead of good vs. evil, he offers us bad versus evil. All the characters do bad things: steal, drink, smoke dope and kill if necessary. But some are simply ""bad"" (people who would be morally upright in a different setting) and others are ""evil"" (no moral code at all, black all the way to the core of their heart). This almost non-dichotomy is probably not unique to Ritchie, but is something he excels in. Highest possible recommendation, you nonce!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Brilliant script, brilliant cinematography, great acting and soundtrack","Best comedy in years, friend turned me on to this hilarious comedy of errors and glad she did. The film is damn near flawless, forces you to pay attention to the twists and turns through it's witty dialogue. Wonderfully photographed with brilliant camerawork but not overdone. Worth several sittings and we could learn alot in Hollywood from this one....",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Brilliant,"I have watched this film countless times and it is always funny, entertaining and visually appealing. It combines a great story (actually about 8 stories), lush cinematography (a personal must have), and superb dialog. When I first saw it, I thought it was a good rip-off of pulp fiction (a common theme on the message boards), but later you come to realize that this simply is not the case. IMO, it is much more like ""The Usual Suspects"", another great film.The visual appeal puts it in my top three list for this (along with The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, and Das Boot).There is no weak character - everyone is perfect and fits into place and has their own role in the whole story. But my personal favorite is Rory Breaker. He manages menacing and humorous at the same time in perfect combination.Favorite lines (from Rory Breaker) ""If you hold back anything, I'll kill ya. If you bend the truth or I think your bending the truth, I'll kill ya. If you forget anything I'll kill ya. In fact, you're gonna have to work very hard to stay alive, Nick. Now do you understand everything I've said? Because if you don't, I'll kill ya.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A British Reservoir Dogs,"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is about four London class act stiffs who put their money to a test in a card game until things end up horribly wrong as they owe half a million pounds within a week to come up with the cash. The movie is by all means, enjoyable. The characters are all likable and their sense of humour makes the movie tick up a notch. I found myself laughing a couple times in the film to the jokes. All the actors played their parts pretty well, but my favorite character of the film had to go to Big Chris as Vinnie Jones. He was the most entertaining and how he was always correcting his son if he ever made any mistakes was priceless. The dialogue was really well done by Guy Ritchie, as well as his directing. What I noticed about the movie, was how much it was alike to the 1992 film, Reservoir Dogs. Lock, Stock had colorful characters, robbery that ends up bad, unexpected tragedies, good screenplay as well as directing by one person, and a good sense of humour. All those resemble to Reservoir Dogs, it's not even funny. Overall, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a good and entertaining comedy/crime film that shows a good future to Guy Ritchie aka ""The Next Quentin Tarantino"", to many. Although it's not up to par with Reservoir Dogs, I still enjoyed it and will be paying a lot of attention to Guy Ritchie's films. I recommend it.Hedeen's Outlook: 8/10 *** B",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Good start for Guy Ritchie,"Bacon (Jason Statham), Eddy (Nick Moran), Tom (Jason Flemyng), and Soap (Dexter Fletcher) are lifelong friends. Eddy is the card player. Bacon, and Tom are hustlers. Soap is straight and legal. They pull together the money to go into Harry 'The Hatchet' big card game. Harry rigs the game and the guys are down £400,000. Harry gives them a week before his muscle Barry the Baptist takes care of them. They decide to rob their drug dealing neighbor. Meanwhile Barry is looking to steal a priceless antique shotgun but it ends up in the hands of the four friends.This is heavily influenced by Quentin Tarantino and that's not a bad thing. This is Guy Ritchie's full length feature debut. It shows that he has skills but it's not quite as polished as 'Reservoir Dogs'. The accents are quite thick. The comedy doesn't always translate well. However Ritchie has got the style down. This also introduced Jason Statham to the movie world.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Watch this with subtitles, if you can","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels features a lot of local slang and Cockney accents and, while it is far from impossible to comprehend, you will be doing yourself a favour if you follow the dialogue in subtitles. In fact, even the unbearably annoying 'hard-of-hearing' option is welcomed. It follows a group of four very ""working class"" blokes as they try to help their friend Eddie (Nick Moran) get out of an enormous debt he amassed one night, playing high-roller with a local gang-boss that cheated. The lads resort to illegal ways to get the money, like ripping off their pot-selling next-door neighbours.This is a really excellent filmentertaining; funny, exciting, and extremely realistic. The style is gorgeous. In fact, I have nothing bad at all to say about it except that it may not be everyone's cup of tea. You also have to be patient with it. That may have been my problem the first time I saw it because I can remember mixing up quite a few people when not paying attention.. Still, the realism of the situations make up for its occasionally slow pace and dialogue-driven plot. For instance, none of these working-class guys know how to handle a gun when they need to, and the result is hilarious. They're not goofy by any means, but they're just normal guys that struggle with the life of crime that they are forced to turn to in order to repay Eddie's debt. Also note the fantastic use of ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" by The Stooges. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
entertaining,"For $8 million, this is a fricking monument of 1990's film.  The first time I saw it I laughed at most of the jokes and followed the plot with pleasure. That's more than I can say about any number of movies in the 1990's that cost ten times as much to make and starred pricey talent.  The editing is clever and cute.  The casting is just short of flawless.  Of the four principles, only Bacon seemed consistent to me.  The minor parts were sometimes spectacular, esp. Big & Little Chris and Barry the Baptist.There are some legitimate complaints about this movie.  The big one is that it doesn't really go anywhere or mean anything.  It seems like an awful lot of flash and talent to end up saying nothing about anything.  But um it's not like Lock, Stock is trying to be anything it isn't, so maybe it's not a valid critique after all.  Considering how long Tarrantino's influence has been around, it's a little unfair to call Ritchie on imitating him.  There are some similarities  large casts, distinct characters, clever dialogue, rapid shifts in narratives from one string to another and shifting in time, and few other things.  I think the problem is that years of dumbing down by Hollywood have almost eliminated all these things.  The influence is there certainly, but it would not seem as pronounced if there were any other hugely exposed filmmakers in recent memory that put as much emphasis on dialogue and character besides Tarantino.I haven't watched MTV since the mid-1980's, so the style of Lock Stock and Snatch didn't seem trite to me.  Some people I talked to said that the film style was too much like the average car commercial or pop video, which is getting the influence backwards, but I could see how those associations would spoil the experience.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Irritating and witless,"Guy Ritchie has gone beyond mere Tarantino imitation and found his own unique voice in crime pictures, but unfortunately it's an irritating, witless, virulent voice. Sure, this movie is colorful and snazzy, but I think everyone gets snookered by the British accents and machine-gun delivery of the lines to realize that nobody says anything remotely intelligent. A lot of British humor is very good, but there's also a tendency to just have everyone be mean and nasty to each other and pretend that that's somehow the pinnacle of wit. Don't mistake flash for substance.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Comedy Noir well done,"I'm not sure whether to call this a black comedy or a comedy-noir. The story is about four working class lads who have each managed to save up 25,000 pounds to spot their card-shark friend for a high-stakes poker game with ""Hatchet"" Harry, the local gangster.Unfortunately, Harry's game is rigged and the four end up owing Harry half a million pounds, with just one week to come up with the cash. What ensues is a set of schemes, counter-schemes, rip-offs, and bad/good luck that demand you pay attention. On several occasions I had to pause the video just to take stock of which gang was planning what.The final thirty minutes of the film, as the plots all collide and overlap, turn set-piece shoot outs into comedic punchlines.  The comedy is driven by exploding our expectations of what are otherwise pretty standard scenes from the film-noir genre.The acting is strong and the script very tight. Although I am not normally a fan of voice overs, this one informs without spoiling the action. And I liked the use of the slow-motion to disrupt the action and keep me paying attention.While this film may not be for everyone, if you enjoy a darker pallette, this may be right up your alley.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Now do you understand everything I've said? Because if you don't, I'll kill ya","I've avoided this movie for sometime now.  Firstly because friends told me that it was 'Pulp Fiction'-ish (and boy do I hate that movie). Secondly, because its British and although I'm from South East London myself and love British television comedies, I have rarely found British humour well translated onto the big screen.  Normally it is toned down to plain slap-stick goofy uncomplicated Inspector Cleuseau type humour tailored for American audiences.But to find not just British, but straight-faced East London cockney-slang and swear filled humour in a really stylish movie was a revelation.I have always believed that British humor, especially East London humor is much more sophisicated than American humour.  Maybe the reason why American audiences have been more forthcoming with LS&2SB is that despite the accent, they finally 'get it' without having to have it remade into an American version, ala Faulty Towers and Threes company and other British comedies. Yet, I believe Tom Cruise is remaking the movie with an American cast.  I suppose for those who just cannot understand English unless its spoken in an American accent.  That is really a shame as there are so many diverse accents all around the world and LS&2SB could not have been done in any accent other than cockney.Still, there are bits only the British will get, like the scene with the three guys pouncing on the traffic warden in the back of the van.  That scene had me clutching my sides.  Only someone living in London can feel true loathing for a traffic warden, the most hated person in Britain.Cinemtography was superb.  I wont go into who's already done the slow-mo's and stop action argument.  It is near impossible to do anything in a movie today that has not already been done.  You can either do nothing - or do whatever you can as long as it suits the mood and the flow of the movie, and Guy Ritchie just cannot be faulted.  He projects the seedy, thin laned, miserable weathered London, yet with such style that you want to see more. The camera work could not have been better.  Just see the projection of Eddy's unsteady, light-headed wooziness as he gets up from the gambling table having lost everything and owing even more.  Brilliant.The Soundtrack was as diverse and yet brilliant as I have ever heard in a movie.  I dont want to look like waving the Union Jack here, but this movie shows that the British have a more diverse taste in music.  From Reggae, to Ska, to Rock, to Mikis Theodorakis every track played just added to the scene showed.In short, LS&2SB is a movie that just does not stop for a second, is full of refreshing humour, filmed with style, has a lively soundtrack, some violence thrown in for good measure, and a story with more twists and turns than a bowlfull of spaghetti.Dont let this movie slip you by.  You'll either love it, or hate it.If this movie was not British, I'd give it an 8/10, but since it is, it gets 9/10 from me.Favourite dialogue: Rory Breaker: If you hold back anything, I'll kill ya. If you bend the truth or I think your bending the truth, I'll kill ya. If you forget anything I'll kill ya. In fact, you're gonna have to work very hard to stay alive, Nick.

Stylish clockwork,"This film's plot starts off a bit convoluted but gradually meshes together like clockwork, with every scene and line having significance. The varying plotlines weave in and out with expert craft, always leaving the audience wondering what will happen next and never alienating them. These are all funny in a subtle, situational way - muted reactions to extraordinary events, chance encounters and thwarted masculine bravado. The characters are exaggerated, the style is frenetic and the environment is gritty and urban.

"In this criminal subculture, they cheat and rob each other.","Never seen a more entertaining gangster film than this one. It elicits belly-laughs with its black humor.Guy Ritchie lures us deep into an intricate world, a world only belonging to streetwise charmers, merciless debt collectors, dope drug dealers, paranoid marijuana growers, eccentric Afros and inept burglars. In this criminal subculture, they cheat and rob each other.Such a film as it is, if shot by a less intelligent, would be a disaster. But Guy makes the story full of twists and coincidences and weaves them all into his well-craft web. Elements like guns, knives, corpses and claret are indispensable parts for a gang film. In Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, guns are replaced by air rifles and antic shotguns, knives by kitchen ones and some kicking. And the bullets fly and corpses aren't that bloody since most are off-screen. And I couldn't help laughing at Soap's theory like "" guns for show, knives for pro"" especially when he soapboxes it with a seriousness on his soft-soap face.The dialog is recommendable and quotable. The shooting angles, especially close-ups cannot be more suitable for this films. See a label sticker under the sole of Harry?

Easily one of my all time favorites,"I didn't know what to expect when I popped this movie in my VCR.  On one hand, I had heard this movie is hilarious, fun, and three steps from Pulp Fiction.  On the other hand, it's British and it may not transfer into my American head very well.  I had heard also that the movie is a rip-off of Pulp.  Well, let me tell you what I think.When the movie was over I found myself on the floor laughing like a giddy schoolchild.  I was laughing for two reasons: 1) This movie is as funny as they say it is and 2) THE MOVIE IS SO GOOD!  I haven't been this giddy after a movie since, well, Pulp Fiction, which is why people compare the two I guess.  But don't let anyone convince you that Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a British remake of Pulp fiction, because anyone who says that is a fool.  The two are completely different.  Okay, maybe not completely different, but they're different enough.For one thing, Lock is no where near as serious as Pulp.  Don't get me wrong, Pulp had its funny moments, but Lock is 100% comedy.  The movie's laughs come from two places.  The first place is the funny dialog.  Once you get past their accents, which are a little on the thick side, you will find that these guys are just plain funny.  The second place is where most of the laughs come from: the plot.  The plot is so damn funny; I can't even begin to talk about it.  Watching these fine British lads get caught up in this mass confusion is good ol' fashion entertainment my friend.The only problem I have with this movie is that the director, Guy Richie, can get a little on the music-video-direction side.  With all the twisted camera angles and the pumped up music one could almost mistake this for a music video on TRL.  This really didn't bother me that much.  Just like in Pulp Fiction, these guys spent some time compiling the soundtrack.

Just incredible,"A bunch of British lads combine their money and enter a high stakes, illegal card game with a vicious criminal. They lose and must pay all the money within a week...or they lose their fingers--one for every day missed.That's just the beginning of an invigorating, fast-moving thriller. Double and triple-crosses abound. The thick British accents are hard to understand at first but you get used to it.

One of the most overrated British films ever,"At the time this film was hailed as a revolution in homegrown Brit film making. From now on we would be churning out film after flim full of rough voiced cockneys killing one another and saying 'slaaaag a lot'. America would begin to find estuary accents fascinating and unlimited funding would flow from the Land of the Free to independent filmakers based in Soho and Noting Hill. Of course nothing of the sort happened.In reality 'Lock, Stock...' was a dead end that resulted in even worse imitators('Shoreditch' or 'Circus'anyone?).It was compared by Lads Lifestyle Mag editors to 'The Italian Job' though the staff of Loaded overlooked the curse that they were handing out. The earlier film will always be a good way to kill two hours on a Sunday afternoon, but it will never play in Poughkeepsie.To be fair it did get Guy Ritchie a sexy Missus and Vinnie jones will never have to do Gladiators again but who of note has actually been influenced by this film?

"wow, the stereotypes","surely in the history of films there can never have been any greater collection of stereotypes in a single film. no opportunity has been missed to come up with characters such as 'Nick the Greek' and Hatchett Harry. In england we complained about what mel gibson chose to do in his awful awful films of braveheart and patriot but we seem to be quite happy to let someone british do the same thing. i suppose that i should feel grateful that noone from birmingham was in it, we would have been portrayed as having a broad accent and being thick no doubt.before anyone accuses me of having a humour bypass, yes i know that this is intentional. i know that they are cardboard cutout villains but that really is no excuse for having a cardboard cutout script. never before have i watched an entire film in which every line appeared to be written down before it was spoken. everything was delivered as though it was all some little in joke that we should all find funny. and i agree with one of the earlier reviewers, vinnie jones CANNOT act. he was in good company here however, since nobody in this film.it appears that this is no-more than a remake of the 'Italian Job' except without a few things, like the 60's style, noel coward, the script, the acting oh, but we were at least rewarded with not one person being michael caine, but at least 6 people trying to be him. only they all failed. badly.this really is the film that launched a thousand british gangster films, they have all been bad. but in that sense they have lived up to imitation being the most sincere form of flattery. for the british readers of this, to me this was like watching an extended episode of 'only fools and horses' with more guns and swearing. pitiful and grotesquely overhyped.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A masterclass in crime comedy,"""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a gritty and entertaining crime film that showcases the talents of its director Guy Ritchie. The film follows a group of friends who become embroiled in a dangerous game of deception and double-crossing after a failed card game. The ensemble cast, led by Jason Flemyng, deliver strong performances that perfectly capture the rough-around-the-edges nature of their characters.One of the most striking things about the film is its visual style, which is heavily influenced by Ritchie's background in music videos. The film is shot with a fast-paced, energetic style that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats. The film's soundtrack is also noteworthy, featuring a mix of classic rock and modern pop songs that perfectly complement the action on screen.Despite its rough exterior, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" also has a surprising amount of heart. The relationships between the characters feel genuine and their struggles are relatable. The film also has a strong sense of humor, with plenty of clever one-liners and slapstick comedy moments.Overall, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a thoroughly entertaining film that showcases the talents of its director and cast. It's a must-see for fans of crime dramas and British cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Nice Movie,"I was a total and complete sucker for this film.If I were to write and direct a movie about gangsters or crime, this would be it. I wouldn't change one damn thing. Not a thing. Everything in this film was, to my eye, perfect - casting, the camerawork, the excellent dialogue (""It's been emotional."")Now I don't have much to compare this to, and I've heard some criticism that it basically draws quite heavily from older British crime dramas. I've got a bunch of these on my queue to rent, but I doubt you could make a crime film better than this.This film oozes with style, class, dark humor, plot twists and turns, and doesn't drag one bit. The casting and characterization is perfect, and Ritchie isn't afraid to move the cameras around; no pretense is really made here at ""realism"" - Ritchie doesn't mask the fact that it's a film and he runs with it.I really don't think of myself as easily impressed, and I have seen a hell of a lot of films in my time, but this one instantly made my Top 10 after only a single viewing. Yes, I'm raving about it, and while it may not be ""spiritually enriching"" or contain any deep sociological content (which I actually do look for in films), somehow it still scores as one hell of a film; memorable and entertaining, and stands up well to multiple viewings.I am a bit dismayed to see some of the marketing of this film comparing it to other things like Quentin Tarantino films or Trainspotting. It really does it a disservice because this film really is its own phenomenon and stands on its own two feet; if anything it is similar to Trainspotting and Tarantino films only because it actually has its own bold style.Can't recommend it enough.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"Good fun, but ultimately failing to live up to the comparisons","I will be honest, I turned on 'Lock, Stock' with very little hope - I had been led to believe that it was a senseless action movie, the type of film that FHM give 10/10, and the rest of the world wouldn't touch with a barge pole. I was pleasantly surprised upon viewing the film, but still could not see how people compare the film to the Pulp Fictions and Trainspottings of this world.Upon reading the comments on 'Snatch', which I am yet to see, I noticed someone saying that the performances on both films were excellent across the board. Not having seen 'Snatch' I am unable to judge that, but i can certainly say that I was disappointed with the acting in 'Lock, Stock'. I felt that while Vinnie Jones made a good debut, and there was the odd good performance, the main quartet certainly let the film down. At times the focus on reeling off snappy dialogue took precedence over actually acting, and to a certain extent this led me to stop actually caring about what happened to the characters. While the thrill of their audacious attempts was great, and some of the lines were hilarious, most viewers get too swept up to really care at all about the characters. Some will say that this doesn't matter, but it certainly does to me.Ritchie's style of direction at times baffled me - at times I saw glimpses of cinematic genius, and realised exactly what the 'music video style' could bring to film, (e.g. Eddie's departure from the poker game) but occasionally shots felt amateurish and lazy - for example look at the two Kennys' 'get the guns' argument near the end of the film. This meant i could occasionally see what the plaudits were on about, and occasionally jumped right back to my original feelings about the film.There is normally nothing that I hate more than pretentious film critics rubbishing a film because it isn't a) a postmodern satire on what it is really like to be a man or b) a documentary on Ukrainian house-husbands, and I did thoroughly enjoy Lock, Stock (I gave it 7/10).

Guy Ritchie Perfection,"The classic crime comedy from Guy Ritchie ranked in high regard of all time British film for its trademark style, memorable nicknames and intricate writing, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is just as popular among cinephile's today, as it was twenty-four years ago.Eddy persuades his three pals to pool money for a vital poker game against a powerful local mobster, Hatchet Harry. Eddy loses, after which Harry gives him a week to pay back 500,000 pounds.The brief description above doesn't do the sensational watch justice, with its numerous overlapping subplots, deaths and twists to allow for the film to flow at its typical fast pace. The introduction to characters add to the genius of the writing, names such as The Baptist, Soap and Bacon I'm certain took just as long to come up with as the story at hand.The impressive cast of Jason Statham - whom brings confidence and leadership to his character, as well as a calmness to even the most chaotic situations. Vinnie Jones joined filming after his release from prison for beating up his neighbour, signs of rehabilitation are non-existent in the picture that seemingly displays only his rage and dominance - the ex-footballer, a regular in Ritchie's productions - exchanges moments of humour to compliment the criminal acts on-screen, performing in a clever double act with his son where all things except profanity go.Ritchie writes as well as directs, and utilises the camera to ensure all potential dangers are anticipated and yet, what follows is the least of expectation, the film gives very little away, with the 106 minutes advancing to neatly tie together the story's journey towards its conclusion.One thing we do not take for granted with a Guy Ritchie film is a concise and masterful ending that allows for reflection over the previous scenes in the movie - where questions are answered in a quick, ever-changing character sequence that still keeps you guessing until the final credits begin to roll.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

A great British movie,I love this movie as it has no class. Gangsters in most movies are annoying idiots dressed up in pinstriped suits with flash cars or are Italian and eat and talk way too much. In lock stock you get four working class friends who need to acquire 500 grand in a week to avoid having their fingers chopped off and worse. Their next door neighbours rob drug dealers. What ensues is a barrage of double crossing cockney slang madness and most of the time takes the black comedy route. The original soundtrack is execellent composed by john murphy and the acting is funny and incredibly good.

''And there's one more thing...it's been emotional' says one of the Slickest 'Gangster' flicks ever!,"'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is one of those films that I can watch x number of times and still enjoy it as much as I did in the first viewing. This is pretty much what an action gangster flick should be like. It has all the required ingredients. The action, humour, drama and suspense balance extremely well. Ritchie's writing and direction are excellent as not only does the film keep one at the edge of his/her seat but the characters (including minor ones) are rich. They're over-the-top but that only works for the film. While the bad guys think they're powerful and all, they're actually portrayed as dumb and the good guys think they're clever and have all the answers to their problems when they're actually not so bright. The characters are portrayed as cool yet they end up getting caught in a mess. The film too is somewhat satirical as it reflects a part of life e.g. the closeness between the four friends, the son following the father's (Big Chris's) footsteps. The humour is mostly dark with sharp, witty and funny dialogues and hilarious situations. It all seems a 'natural' part of the story. Shot in DV, the camera-work and use of music is very effective. The film has a raw and gritty look yet the execution of it makes it very stylish. Richie uses the same style in 'Snatch'. He should become an auteur and make more movies of this kind as it is clearly his fort (remember his disastrous attempt at romance with 'Swept Away'?). All the actors, whether it's Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran, Jason Statham or more recognized faces like Vinnie Jones and Sting, seem to naturally fit their parts. 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' is one of the coolest 'gangster' flicks.

One of the best scenes (without giving any of the plot away) is when a barman is describing an event to a customer in very broad Cockney and sub titles pop up explaining what he is saying.

Among the best British films,"""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a classic comedy noir about misunderstandings, coincidences and overconfidence. Four young men, three of whom are relatively harmless black marketers, try to win a lot of money by playing poker with the local gangster, Harry. This backfires horribly, and they owe £ 500,000.The rest of the film is about their search for the money. It involves their far more dangerous neighbours, naïve university dropouts who sell marijuana, a drug dealer described as ""a madman with an afro"" and, of course, the Harry and his men, most memorably Big Chris, the debt collector. Whether the characters are two-dimensional or just trying to live up to certain underground stereotypes I do not know, but it doesn't matter. They are parodies, but good ones.Guy Ritchie's experience as a music video director is obvious; there is a certain MTV-feel about it. Added to that, this film is so London-oriented that most of us will feel as if we're missing half the jokes, and there are times when subtitles will come in handy, even for a native speaker (e.g. ""He then proceeds to order an Aristotle of the most ping-pong tiddly in the Nuclear sub"").

Very British,"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is an entertainingly original film by Guy Ritchie that suffers a bit from lack of star power.

Many of the actors playing the tough guy gangsters just didn't look or sound very tough at all which took some of the gravity of the scenes away.

"Saw ""Snatch"" and Wanted More","I saw the movie ""Snatch"" and instantly I knew I wanted to see more from Guy Ritchie. Fortunately, I didn't even have to do much work because the very next movie Amazon queued up was ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.""This one wasn't quite up to the level of ""Snatch,"" but it was good nonetheless. I'm noticing a certain style that involves a lot of moving parts that are seemingly disconnected yet all come together at one point or another.Four friends: Eddy (Nick Moran), Bacon (Jason Statham), Tom (Jason Flemyng), and Soap (Dexter Fletcher) decided to pool their money together for a big card game. The buy in was 100,000 Pounds, so they all chipped in 25,000 a piece to get Eddy into the game. Eddy was a master card player, but what he couldn't know was that the house was cheating. The house in this case was Hatchet Harry Lonsdale (P.H. Moriarty). Eddy got into a bidding war with Harry on a losing hand. When Eddy got to the point where he couldn't match the ante any further, Harry loaned him the money to match. A bit weird I know; your card playing opponent loaning you the money to match him in the game. Once the inevitable happened and Eddy lost, he and his friends had a week to repay Harry 500,000 P... Let's see... if I convert that to U.S. dollars in 1998... carry the one... add a zero... Screw it. It was around $1,000,000.It goes without saying that four blokes who barely mustered up 100,000 P between them were not going to have an easy time getting a hold of 500,000 P. Well, the Lord works in mysterious ways, and so does Guy Ritchie because they were able to divine a plan. Since this is a Guy Ritchie film that plan was anything but clean.

It'll blow you away.,"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is one of those rare movies that flies under the radar until it gathers a cult following.This is Guy Ritchie's directorial debut. The story focuses around five groups of people, but mainly four friends who are now in deep trouble when Tom, a highly skilled card shark, loses in a card game that was rigged. They find themselves a quarter million dollars in debt and have only a week to get out of before ""Hachet"" Harry will start chopping their fingers off. The other story lines come into play when Tom and his three friends try to figure out a way to come up with the money.What I like about this film is the fresh script writing and odd humor. The opening sequence (Jason Statham street peddling with help from Jason Flemming) sets the right pace for a comedic and fast paced flick. From there we are introduced to every other character in their own unique way. My favorite characters have got to be Big Chris and Little Chris. Big Chris (played by Vinnie Jones) is the kind of character that was placed in the script to be the tough guy. Usually the tough guy is someone rather generic, but Guy Ritchie places Little Chris (Peter McNicholl) as Big Chris's young son to show a soft side to Big Chris. Big Chris tries to keep Little Chris from becoming a mindless thug by showing him how to do things properly without using foul language and such. The two characters become very comedic and do not become tired over the course of the movie.Another great element of this movie is the soundtrack. I actually got ticked off when one of the songs stopped playing when I wanted it to go on. Very stylish and the music seems to go right with every scene.Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is highly enjoyable and won't disappoint you.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

An Absolute Double-Barrelled Blast!,"Gads what a great flick! This is a twisty, turny, shoot-em-up and laugh at the outcome type of flick. Brilliant in its pacing, plot, scripting and delivery. THIS is how comedies should be made.It has a plot that's so complex it's hard to explain, but they pull it off brilliantly. All comedies have a screwball plot, but not all of them can pull it off. Sometimes you're so fixated on the fact that ""this film makes no sense"" that you can't revel in the humor. With ""Lock, Stock"" that is NOT a problem at all. You can go with the flow, and can be amazed as all these diversely bizarre threads come together at the end.The movie also dives into that great comic well -- known as Lower Class Britain -- and delivers everything it can possible promise. Copious profanity. Indecipherable (for us Americans) Cockney slang. Seedy locales. Multicultularism that blends in famously. And stuff that only is funny out of a Brit's mouth (if an American delivered these lines it would be horrible).The timing and pacing of this movie are spot-on. Only very rarely are there bits that ""hang"", most of it is just one spot after another, bang bang bang bang. These folks really have comic timing down to an art form.Love the over-the-top hints of violence, too. In true Brit fashion they don't throw violence on the screen like Tarantino might. It's all there, though, and in great form. The ludicrousness of it is suggested, both in off-screen sounds and in the hilariously gruesome aftermath. Utterly brilliant in delivery!

The characters are all vulgar misfits comic book males who become drones of monotony in short order. The contrasty sepia visual effect also wears thin unless you enjoy looking at jaundiced hepatitis patients in poor, almost posterized quality.

Classic East London Masterpiece,"Can't get enough of Guy Ritchie's masterpiece. So spot on. The accent, the dialogues, the performances...

"Hugely enjoyable, but ultimately lightweight","This is a well-written, well-acted and beautifully shot gangster movie in which Vinnie Jones is as good as everyone says (though playing a menacing thug was not perhaps the greatest test of his acting abilities). However, like most of the other films which constitute the `renaissance' of British cinema (e.g. The Full Monty) this is a thoroughly enjoyable, but ultimately lightweight offering.The plot revolves around a number of caricatures; we have the ruthless gangland boss (into collecting expensive guns and beating people to death with dildos), the `soft' marijuana-growing public-school boys and a couple of thieving Scousers who would probably be more at home in a Harry Enfield sketch than in the East End, while the heroes are essentially the bunch of bumbling amateur criminals so beloved of the British psyche. Despite the inevitable comparisons to Reservoir Dogs et al, this is a very British film which in general rejects the slick wit of Tarantino to play on its caricatured characters with a mixture of understatement, sarcasm and dark cockney humour, with the occasional slice of slap-stick comedy thrown in for good measure. The plot twists and turns engagingly backed by an excellent soundtrack, and the ending is a relief from standard Hollywood predictability. However,  I was surprised to find that a lot of the much-touted violence was more comic than genuinely unnerving which was perhaps a shame  sustaining a more chilling atmosphere to contrast with the laughs would have contributed some depth to this film.Do go and see Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels- it is fun and well worth the entrance money. But it is as likely to change your perspective on life as Lethal Weapon 4.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Don't believe the hype,"After watching ""Lock Stock"" my first reaction was, mmmmm, not bad.  The more I thought about it however, the more I realised that it really IS bad.  It tried to be so many things at once - violent, funny, ultra-cool, unpredictable, cutting edge, etc. In my opinion, it generally missed the target.Yes, it did have moments of humour, but these were generally when glorifying violence, or through characters acting ""hard"".  It was certainly violent in places, had a few neat twists towards the end, but ultimately left you thinking that the director Guy Ritchie was just trying to be Britain's answer to Quentin Tarantino - well sorry Guy, you lack the characterisation and humour.  Remember Pulp Fiction?  We all laughed when John Travolta shot that guy in the face - to laugh in the face of shocking violence takes the work of a genius - Guy Ritchie has two goons being shot by an unseen airgun marksmen with the ultra-violent ""boss"" shouting ""will everyone stop getting shot"".  Yeah, hilarious.The acting was TERRIBLE.  Everyone sounded retarded - I've been to London, nobody speaks like that!

Brilliant movie,"The movie is brilliant and has me hooked to Guy Ritchie whom I knew nothing about apart from the fact that he was married to Madonna once. Guy is a entertainer in his own right in my eyes know (Madonna or no Madonna).I could not understand some of the dialogues not only the first time but till the fourth time. Though I did understand 85% of the dialogues but only could comprehend the 15% left after turning on the subtitles. This does not mean the dialogues are not good. They are excellent. The accent - great! I'm going to try and get it in fact. Some of the dialogues are delivered so fast that they cannot be comprehended. The dialogues contain gems and exposed me to English slang like no other piece of art. Sample this ""Eddie: They're armed.Soap: What was that? Armed? What do you mean armed? Armed with whatEddie: Err, bad breath,colorful language, feather duster... what do youthink they're gonna be armed with? Guns, you tit! ""The camera work is brilliant. Some of the techniques were fairly new at that time which have been hailed as path breakers for example the camera work when one of the protagonist looses a card game.The actors, some of whom I have never heard of till date, fit their roles like hand in glove.The music is just about perfect yet diverse. A soundtrack worth buying.Some viewers would categorize it as comedy or black comedy but I would beg to disagree.

Something I'd consider as very good,"The very entertaining ending makes this film.I wasn't sure about 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' up until that point. Like, don't get me wrong, it is a good film from the get-go but I wasn't personally convinced by it to be more than that until the credits rolled - at which point, I found myself to have been thoroughly entertained.With Guy Ritchie in his directing debut and a whole host of familiar British faces, it isn't a difficult film to get into. I did feel at some points that there were too many characters and that they weren't distinctive enough; there were momentary bits where I had to think a tad harder at which characters were linked with each other. However, that actually turns into the film's best thing at the end as it does come together brilliantly.All in all, this 1998 gangster flick is something I'd consider as very good and worthy of watching.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"Funny, cool and stylish.","Lock Stock has become a National Treasure. As a British film fan I have never been more thankful for a movie. It certainly ranks up there with Get Carter, Trainspotting et al.Guy Ritchie has hardly any flaws as a director, and almost none as a sharp, witty gritty screenwriter. Ritchie burst onto the feature film scene after helming some noteable TV adverts and music vids, and he manages to achieve a bizzare mixture of frenetic serenity. Some scenes use quick cuts, editing magic and a thumping theme tunes, while others flow by using close-ups, sweeping camera movements and placid funk and soul writhing in the background.Some sequences really catch the eye; the opening featuring Jason Statham's famous street salesman speech (partly improvised by Statham, an ex-dodgy goods salesman), and rolling into the getaway using Ocean Colour Scene's '100 Mile High City' as a backdrop. The first sight of Vinnie 'Big Chris' Jones to the menacing funk of James Brown's 'Payback'. Never has a song suited a character so perfectly. And the three card brag sequence, both in wit and in the sheer editing masterclass provided by Ritchie and his editor Niven Howie, is a moment so perfectly cut, tableaud and jumbled that you cannot help but marvel at the sheer cheekiness of the pair.The cast do their bit. Some hip cameos and sterling lead foursome help the whole thing to raise a notch. Were it not for the presence of Lennie McLean, Vinnie Jones, Sting and Danny John Jules, and the four bickering main actors then this film would have been as poor as the series that became of it. But the four leading men do a fantastic job with the comedy provided by the script. Nick Moran should have made a good career out of his role as Ed, the card shark with a sly tongue, and a quick eye. Jason Statham plays Bacon as a sarcastic rogue. Jason Flemyng is cheeky, adventurous, would be entrepeneur Tom. And Dexter Fletcher gives it his all in his role as clean living, yet slightly unnerving performance as Soap.But the star of this movie, is the script. Ritchie goes in full throttle on the Cockney dialect and sheer flamboyance of the dialogue. The use of accent from the cockney contingent is complemented well by scousers Gary and Barry. Ritchie throws the camera around with glee, adds a catchy, populist soundtrack and lets the dirty and flirty gangsters of London banter away.One of the most qoutable movies in recent history, and rightly so. Every character has their scene, and Ritchie never leaves the camera standing. Fantastic, graceful, indulgent, emphatic, whatever you want to call 'Lock, Stock', just make sure you appreciate how cool it is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Good Actors, Not So Good Film","Admittedly, I only saw this movie once, but what stuck me most about it was the disparity between the quality of the the performances and the overall lack of originality in the film itself. The characters go through the story with a lot of energy and natural charm (much like the characters in ""Go"") - I really enjoyed watching them perform. Outside of that, just about everything else in the film, from the quick cut  editing to the lead gangster's jherri - curl afro, is far too similar to ""Pulp Fiction"" to merit any praise. Tarantino's work is one of my favorite films of all time, but people have been going to his well way too often. LS&2SB does a better job at it than most, which is nice. However, I would have liked to see what would have happened if these superior actors were given more to do than channel the ""talkative criminal"" theme.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Probably the least enjoyable movie experience of my life...,"This is the film that spawned all the shockingly bad British gangster films of 1999 and 2000 and this is no better than any of it's offspring.The basic premise of the film is far from original, a group of young criminals make a mess of a job and so on, blah blah blah.  The film is billed as being a crime comedy but I don't recall laughing once.  The characters are your typical cockneys, aside from the irritating accent, all you hear is various people being referred to as muppets, mugs and slags and then indulging in glorified violence.  Nothing wrong with violence, some of my favourite films are heavy on the bloodshed, including ""Goodfellas"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" but this is a dismal attempt to make it seem funny, when it really isn't.Guy Ritchie, despite the reputation he is building for himself strikes me as being a director of a lot of style but very little substance and I don't care how many people tell me otherwise, VINNIE JONES CANNOT ACT.  The same could also be said for the rest of the performers in this appalling, yet well-received film.  Avoid at all costs.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

It would be nice for US people to look at cultures outside their own.  Also some have ridiculed the films editing and camera style. Well there is a way other than your bog-standard high concept mass appeal cash-ins.I saw Lock Stock way before Snatch and it was so good to see a decent British gangster film given the state the last few years had been.  It seems that most of the reviewers only saw the film recently and since then it has lost its freshness.  When I saw Snatch, although I very much liked it as a film in its own right, I thought it was just a poorer version of lock stock made with a higher budget.

I love it!,"I have a deep admiration for Guy Ritchie, and this film kept a smile on my face throughout its entire duration. The impeccable comedic timing, reminiscent of Snatch and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, is something I cherish. The infusion of dark humor and clever dialogue resonates with me. The delivery of the lines feels authentic, immersing you in the gritty streets where the characters navigate their low-life existence. Each character possesses unique traits, even though they all have a certain level of scoundrel in them. Surprisingly, there are a few characters that you can't help but genuinely like. The performances are true to life, with some being exceptionally stellar. Despite being a directorial debut, it exudes the charm of seasoned entertainment.

Action X,"I'm not really surprised that this film is popular with the under 45 crowd. I suppose, regrettably, that this is the direction filmmaking is heading.  I call it Action X (typified by Pulp Fiction) because it is a genre unto itself loved by Generation X.  It is a combination of Action/Adventure, Film Noir, and Horror laced with bizarre characters, offbeat themes, sick humor and lots of irony.  Personally, I don't find it very entertaining, but I have to give it credit for creativity and boldness.If there is one area I have to compliment in this film it is the direction. Excellent, daring photography, scenes well thought out, lots of interesting stuff happening on the screen.  I gave this a 6 only because it was so well directed.  The script was clever, but pointless and if there was any theme to the story it was that stupid people tend to do stupid things and end up dead, except our heroes who do stupid things and are just lucky enough to get away with it.Though I understand the film's appeal, I guess I just can't appreciate a film that uses excellent filmmaking technique to produce a product so unrefined.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Fantastic film,"I watched this film years ago, but I wanted to watch again to see if it still holds up as a great film today. And I can safely say it does. It's such a great film, it's funny, it keeps you in suspense, the writing is fantastic and overall it's just a good watch.The writing/plot is what makes this film for me. You often see films with multiple storylines flop massively as they do it wrong, but this film does it so well and how they all link together towards the end is just perfection. The ending for me is brilliant also, it's not predictable at all (neither is any of the plot), you're left guessing constantly as to what's going to happen. You think you have the ending figured out and it doesn't go that way at all. The characters were great as well, all had their fun quirks and charms about them and although there's a good amount of characters in this, it's written well enough where it's not hard to lose track of any.So I have just brown nosed this film quite a lot. But the reason it's not higher than a 8/10 is the acting. There's some poor acting floating about, Harry's right hand man springs to mind here. For me, I think it's part of the charm of the film. But it can be noticeable.That's all I have to say really on this one. It's a must watch if you haven't seen already! Probably the best one Guy Ritchie has done!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Lame attempt to make an MTV/Witty Mob film,"Not only is this film vastly overrated, it's just plain bad. The story-line itself is tired. The manner in which the jokes are made for the viewer is along the lines of ""Pulp Fiction"". A lot of the humor in Tarantino's film has grown stale over time, but this movie is even worse. ""Pulp Fiction"" at least has some fresh lines, and the actor's are more believable as criminals. Guy Ritchie's effort seems as if he wants to become the European heir to Tarantino. He plays all too hard to try for the pop-culture youth demographic. This takes away from the film. All throughout it emits the feeling of a director looking for his Muse; but he can't find one so he ends up trying to imitate Scorsese and Tarantino - but convert them ""hip"" to young Anglo culture. The editing is wretched. When I first saw this film over in the British Isles I could tell it was directed by some young hot-shot who used to make music videos and was trying to hand at feature-length film - but using the same video techniques he employed in his previous works. It's choppy and stupid. If you want to see a film made with real insights of the crime underworld, which also contains genuine moments of laughter see ""GoodFellas"" or ""Mean Streets"". This movie is a waste, and in due time people will realize that it's pop-culture feel is paper-thin and no longer wears well.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A flaming heap of excrement.,"If you've ever seen Pulp Fiction, you know that it's an intelligent and groundbreaking movie that flipped the Zetigeist of big-Hollywood production in 1994.  Guy Ritchie, in his completely overrated and overdone debut, takes everything that made Pulp Fiction a great film, rubbed poop on it, and rewrapped it with interesting-looking directorial maneuvers that belong not on the silver screen but instead are meant to flop around in the cesspools of MTV.  No wonder Ritchie won MTV's ""Best New Director"" award -- he copied thousands of music video tricks in order to pull off this boring, confusing, and banal heist movie.  It has terrible acting, awful and forgettable writing, and a storyline that meanders and, at best, serves only to cause more disappointment when a new ""character"" is introduced or one of the many goons gives his theories of life.

"""Planks o'wood! I'm working with f*****' planks o'wood!""","Just two short years since it's release, time has already made it possible to detest Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.For a start, this is the film that resurrected a trend for half-baked British gangster films (Circus, Love, Honour and Obey, Rancid Aluminium...), not to mention it's own spin-off television series. Sexist, racist, homophobic and charmless, ""Lock Stock"" (3) was the ultimate extension of the ""new lad"" mindset; only an irresistibly funky theme tune preventing it from being completely irredeemable. In the midst of all this it's very easy to forget that the movie which started it all is actually a halfway decent film.It's no classic, of course. Direction, themes and execution are all highly derivative. Then there's the acting, or lack thereof. The wooden delivery of many players is such that the stylised, witty/self-conscious and contrived (delete as applicable) dialogue sounds one hundred times worse than it actually is. Nick Moran, while being better than most involved, is possibly the most annoying, his poor man's Michael Caine routine wearing thin very, very quickly.In this sense it's perhaps fortunate that the movie is also the acting debut of footballer Vinnie Jones. Being surrounded by such underachieving thespian talent makes him seem a whole lot better than he actually is; though he does fine. The same can't be said of Sting, I'm afraid. There's also a nice cameo by Red Dwarf's Cat, Danny John-Jules, as a subtitled, jive-talking Cockney.Ultimately, despite it's obvious shortcomings, the multiple plot strands and timeframes of this movie are thrown together with such force, pace and comic-book vigour that it does make for passable, average entertainment.

The Lad's done well !,"Sitting in the cinema 10 minutes into this film, thought to myself ""I was told that this was quite Funny, but nothing has happened yet"". 5 minutes later I was ready to get my coat.But then Vinnie appeared, If you live outside of the UK, you may never have heard of Vinnie Jones before so will have no idea why he may well be the main reason that many people (like myself) went to see this film. Vinnie is a professional footballer, and when I heard that he was to be given a reasonable sized part in a low budget movie, I was curious just to see how truly awful both he and the film would be. I could not have been more wrong, both Vinnie and the film are absolutely superb ( I think Vinnie outshines a lot of professional actors I have seen).From the Moment Vinnie arrives the humour starts. In a tale that involves what seems to be too many separate stories to possibly gel at the end, the laughs come thick and fast. This is humour of a Pulp Fiction kind, watching someone get beaten up should horrify you, but in this film its hysterical ! It's quirkiness and the relationship between the 4 friends that are the main characters reminded me a bit of ""Swingers"".Am I now going to give away the plot ?No! this is my first ever review, so I'll leave the rest to the professionals.All I will leave you with is my opinion.This is a GREAT movie, go see it",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Wildly disorganized entertainment.,"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels (1998)3/4I liked this film much more than I thought I would. Granted, this isn't a great movie - but it's got its own adrenaline and energy to make it wildly entertaining. I've never been a fan of Guy Ritchie's films, but I like this one. Ritchie's style is too frenetic for me, especially with films like 'Snatch', which I don't like because of this. But Ritchie's directorial flair is more minimal than some of his other movies, and this serves the movie well. It's entertaining, not too hard to follow, and well written. The dialogue is also very good. But it's really the character here - they're fun to follow, and the most entertaining part of this movie.The plot, which is nearly indecipherable as it's so complicated, follows Eddy (Nick Moran), who convinces his two best friends to pool money for an important poker game played against a local mobster, Hatchet Harry (P. H. Moriarty). But Eddy loses, and Harry gives him one week to pay back his owed 500,000 pounds.Ritchie's writing and directing is discombobulating, and the plot is sometimes hard to follow. But the whole movie is vastly entertaining, and never lets you down. It's Ritchie's movie, because he's keeping your head spinning for the whole time.I liked the movie, but I didn't think it was the best British movie ever made, as some people say. But as far as a good crime movie goes, this one is massively entertaining, and really good.3 STARS (OUT OF 4)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

The British answer to Tarantino,"The story isn't the most original, but the storytelling and of course the endless series of twists, misunderstandings and coincidences that are reminiscent of a Coen brothers movie more than make up for it. Another common link between them and even more clearly with Tarantino as well would be the mix of dark humour and excessive violence. Hilarious comedy and adrenaline-fueled action make it the perfect movie to hang out with the boys.And it's very stylish, too, for example when Eddie loses all the money and all he has is a huge loan to pay with I Wanna Be Your Dog playing or the preparation before the final showdown with Zorba's Dance playing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
And so it began,"It had been quite some time since I first saw this. The beginning of Guy Ritchie and the beginning of Jason Statham. If you watch this after all the movies he has done since, you may be a bit surprised by his role here. But back then, he was not a big shot, quite the opposite was the case. And this movie was quite rough on the edges. While I remembered the humor and comedy, I had forgotten about the grimness at places. About how down and dirty it is sometimes.While maybe some things are meant as fun (like beating up a person in the back of your car for their job/profession) and aside the question if there was a personal agenda of any of the makers of this behind that, the scene and others just feel mean and almost out of place. In stark contrast to something like a machine gun scene that is just funny (even though also quite violent).Maybe it will depend on your own level of what you can take and what you are ok with. Someone like Vinnie Jones is and was infamous - and he shows off why in this movie. Yes he is playing a character ... some might feel he just is himself, maybe dialed up a little bit.The movie was used as bluepring by many when it was made and it made the careeer of quite a few that were involved in this.

As brutal as the Kray twins - but funnier,"If you like your comedy 'au-lait' as opposed to black, then this is not the film for you. A hard-nosed graphic depiction of the London east-end, the film starts as your basic gangster/loan shark movie. But once it gets going the pace, action, characters and comedy don't stop until the last minute of the film. I was exhausted.The characters are excellent - even the two slightly over-the-top scousers seem to be realistic in this almost caricature world. Some of the situations verge on the surreal - but still fit.The cinematography is excellent, and makes brilliant use of slowed and speeded shots. The scene where the over-confident Eddy realizes he's up the proverbial creek for a EXTREMELY large amount of money had me feeling nearly as queasy as Eddy.All in all - a great film - plenty of pace, plenty of action, plenty of bodies, and plenty of humour.

Absolutely brilliant,"Comparing Guy Ritchie to Quentin Tarantino may have its perks, but I'd prefer not to. The only similarity between them is that they depict the lives and times of low-life criminals in a humorous way, and that they both have a real skill in writing plots with many twists and turns. However alike their writing is, there is nothing similar in their directing. While Tarantino is sometimes painfully slow and contemplative, Ritchie is fast, violent, witty and music video influenced. And there's a time for both. But for sheer fun I'd go with Ritchie.""Lock, Stock..."" is insane. At some points, the story is almost believable but don't hang on to that - it quickly becomes a twisted, weird, fast-moving and funny, FUNNY mess of a plot where the casual and unintentional interactions between the different gangs and individuals almost become hard to follow. There are some scenes that alone make this movie worth watching - the sequence when the cannabis-harvesting loons shoot at the gangsters trapped in the steel cage with a soft air gun, or when the OD-chick suddenly comes alive with the machine gun. Hilarious, stupid, insane and fast-paced. Humor or the best kind. The cast couldn't be better, even Sting is pretty good the few moments he appears. But Vinnie Jones really tops it - not so much for is acting skills, but more for his character. Brutal and by far the smartest of the lot, he drags his little son around the messes that he makes, careful not to let the boy hear any profanity.A great film, and one that I certainly will watch again and again.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

not the best Guy Ritchie movie.,This movie was not all bad but I just don't think it was as good as lets say Snatch or something. The actors all did a really good job and there was some exciting parts but the story line kind of just lost it for me.This movie is about 4 British working class stiffs who pool their money together to play a high stakes card game. However something goes wrong and all the sudden they are in debt half a million pounds and they only have one week to come up with the money.This movie was good it was just nothing special.

"Sure it's a Tarantino ripoff, but who cares?","People complaining about this movie being a ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""True Romance"" knock-off need to get a life.  Maybe once every ten years a truly original movie is presented to the public and Hollywood spends the next decade serving up copies of it. The most we can hope for in most cases is that a movie, if not completely original, is at least done well, and I thought this movie was done pretty damn well. It cracked me up and I was digging the plot twists for the same reason I dig Tarantino flicks. So what if the style and story remind you of a couple of other movies, or if, in a couple of cases, you can see what's coming in the next scene?

Tasteless violence,"Hollywood has no monopoly on crass, vulgar, tasteless, blood spewing depravity.This ghastly piece of British trash is as good (bad?) as anything the schlockmeisters of US cinema have ever done.

The story line is complicated enough --- you can't tell the bad guys from the good guys because there are no good guys --- but the thick east end London accents make the dialogue incomprehensible for the most part.

Amusant,"""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998) is a British crime comedy directed by Guy Ritchie, marking his directorial debut. The film follows a group of friends who find themselves in deep trouble after getting involved in a high-stakes card game with a powerful crime lord. When they fail to come up with the money they owe, they must navigate a series of chaotic and interconnected events to avoid the dire consequences.Ritchie's stylish direction, rapid-fire dialogue, and non-linear storytelling give ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" its distinctive and energetic vibe. The film's ensemble cast, including Jason Statham, Nick Moran, and Vinnie Jones, delivers memorable performances that bring the colorful characters to life with humor and charisma.""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is celebrated for its sharp wit, clever plot twists, and inventive visual style. Ritchie's use of freeze frames, split screens, and montages adds to the film's kinetic energy and keeps viewers engaged from start to finish.The film was a critical and commercial success upon its release, earning praise for its originality and entertainment value. It has since become a cult classic and solidified Ritchie's reputation as a filmmaker with a unique and distinctive voice.Overall, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a wild and exhilarating ride through the London underworld, filled with memorable characters, quotable dialogue, and unexpected twists and turns.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Innovative, original, one of my favorites.","When I first saw this movie shorty after it hit the US shores, I was really disappointed. I thought it was boring, uninteresting and hard to follow. About a year later I gave it another try. Lo and behold it became one of my top 5 movies (with the company of Boondock Saints, Taxi Driver, Pulp Fiction, and The Shawshank Redemption). It took awhile for me to piece it all together, but the plot is very clever and probably one of my favorites ever. The acting is great, the one liners are great, the soundtrack is EXCELLENT (the Dusty Springfield and James Brown fit in so well to the style of the film), the characters were memorable (not quite as cartoonish as in SNATCH, which is good). I've seen this movie more times than I've seen any other, and I love it each time. It's one of three movies that I find myself ""preaching"", along with Boondock Saints and Taxi Driver, as many people have not seen them.I have to strongly disagree with many of the comments I read that Guy Ritchie copied Tarantino in making this film. This film is a completely different animal than Pulp Fiction. This is a crime caper/comedy, while Pulp Fiction is just a ""day in the life"" of a group of characters. Pulp Fiction really doesn't have much of a plot; it relies heavily on its everyday dialogue and out of sequence storytelling, but things just sort of fall into place. Lock Stock is intricate heist, which flows in chronological order, for that matter. People seem to call this movie a Pulp Fiction clone simple because several groups of characters fates are intertwined. Movies that clearly ""borrow"" from Pulp Fiction include Boondock Saints, Go, and Memento (all some of my favorite films, by the way), because of their out-of-sequence storytelling.But this isn't a review for Pulp Fiction, now is it? In the end, this movie is original, smart, funny, all around entertaining, and completely enjoyable. I give it 10/10 (while I don;t overuse a score of 10 like some people, out of all the films I've seen, I've allotted the score 6 times).

Some flaws but generally a fine introduction to the gangster movie Guy Ritchie style,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsA member of a small group of cockney wide-boys loses in a poker game and finds himself in debt to a feared local mob boss. Desperate to keep his fingers, him and his friends agree to rob a gang that are about to rob a gang of local drug dealers. But no one's going quietly- and things threaten to turn nasty.As well as Ritchie (behind the camera) the film also made fairly big names out of it's main stars, Jason Statham, Dexter Fletcher, Nick Moran and Jason Fleming, not to mention the acting debut of notorious soccer hardman Vinnie ""it's been emotional"" Jones.We're certainly not talking about a bad film, here, a film that definitely got some big names rocking and rolling and understandably so. But the plot doesn't flow as smoothly here and it's filmed through-out in a really dinghy use of the camera that didn't appeal. Not to mention an ending that feels like it's dragging on somewhat.A good film, then, very stylish and quite clever, but Ritchie was to make a more digestible and enjoyable film a few years later with Snatch.

A Victim Of Its Own Success,"I watched this soon after it was released on video and was blown away ( Geddit ? ) by it . Unfortunately after seeing it a few more times since then I notice it`s become a victim of its own success . By that I mean every single British film released between 1999 and 2002 seemed to be about gangsters in one form or another carrying out a scam against a funky soundtrack in an inferior retread of LSATSB . In fact Guy Ritchie isn`t below plagerising himself with SNATCH which was basically the same film stylewise . But this was the original and best of the Brit gangster new wave. Brilliantly written in a sharp bleakly comical style with some mind bending cinematography by Tim Maurice Jones . There is some criticism that the acting is a bit wooden but I guess that`s deliberate on the part of Ritchie so that the dialogue comes to the fore . And what great lines the characters have , especially Rory`s "" Do you understand Nicholas ? Good cos if you don`t I`ll kill ya "" speech .BTW this film cost less than one million pounds to make . Take note Hollywood that you don`t have to spend tens of millions of dollars to make a great movie",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Mr Madonna's Finest Hour,"I haven't exactly followed Guy Ritchie's career since ""Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"". After going to see ""Snatch"", which treads similar ground to ""Lock Stock"", I decided that Mr Ritchie was a Johnny-One-Note.That first note, however, was a good'un.""Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels"" is NOT a great movie. I daresay that in 20 or 30 year's time it will look horribly dated and the dialogue will require subtitling. The pop-video direction and editing will also mark it as the work of another 90's-era hack director making the transition into ""proper"" cinema.On the plus side, the viewer is treated to a very humorous script and a bizarre view of the hinterland where ordinary folk rub along with the criminal classes. Mr Ritchie succeeds in creating a world where all the characters seem to talk like Del Boy without it getting on yer bleedin' tits after the first half hour. In fact, the movie marks the point where everyone who lived and worked in London began dropping their aitches wholesale. Within weeks of the film's release, all the corporate City types in the coffee shops and pubs around the Lloyds Building had gone from Oxford English to sounding like Big Chris and Nick the Greek. You can't buy a cultural impact like that, although the producers of ""Snatch"" gave it a go.A fine cast puts meat on the bones of their characters, with the exception of one Jason Statham. Mr Statham plays a slab of beef, a role that he was asked to reprise (and did so willingly, it seems) in ""Snatch"". There is also a leaden cameo from the partner of one of the film's producers, none other than Sting. Bearing in mind this guy's energetic and unhinged turns in films like ""Dune"" and ""Brimstone and Treacle"", Sting's performance here is phoned in.""Lock Stock"" was such a hit and such an influential and innovative movie that it set off a tidal wave of derivative and mostly inferior Brit gangster flicks that took about 6 years to peter out. That was Guy Ritchie's biggest hurdle, and one that he has yet to overcome.

You Love 'Um, I love 'um, everyone including Scorsce & Tarantino loves 'umOK, this movie has been winning many a plaudit, not just from the UK but from all over the world for it's fast talking gangsters & comic plot twists. My Friends love it, My Workmates love it, even the bloke down the Pub has to tell me what a great film it is. In fact I recently got told by a portly fellow who seemed to have had too many Vodka's who was travelling on a train with me, that Graham Green's novel Brighton Rock was based on Lenny McLean who played Barry The Baptist. I smiled and agreed with him, not sure whether to tell him that Brighton Rock was written 60 years ago.So whats so great about this film with a cast made from unknown actors & real life criminals and Footballers. Well Absolutely nothing really.Although I will admit that the film was funny at time's in a 'laugh out loud' kindda way. The Dialoge still seems a bit crap, If I may be frank. All the lines are written (& said for that matter) in the style of Michael Caine on a bad day, there seems to me no attempt to ever act as such in this film & how everyone says that Vinny Jones Acts well is beyond me due to the fact he doesn't seem to have to. However maybe this is missing the point, maybe Guy Ritchie wanted the dialogue to sound like a bad Michael Caine film, there lies the joke, however I've got other criticisms.Lets look at some plot characteristics. A group of young, small time crooks. One of them upsets a big guy & has a contract on him, the action also revolves around a bar. Basically it's Mean Streets with a dope sub-plot & a happy ending.Also a major problem is the direction & camerawork. At time's the film turned from a film & attempted to experiment with editing & camerawork, this would be fine apart from the fact that nothing was experimental & looked more like a pop promo, this wasn't helped by a largely trendy soundtrack.So in sum shouldnt really have been in the cinema, MTV would have been a better place for it.

"Low Budget, Big Hit","Film: Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) Genre:Comedy/Crime/Thriller Written and Directed by: Guy Ritchie Budget:£960,000 Box Office Sales: US: $3,897,569 International: $21,400,000 Total: $25,297,569My Critique: Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is one of my favorite movies. Not only is it a great film, but it gives me inspiration as an aspiring film maker. The storyline is set in England, about four guys who lose a fixed card game and owe £500,000 to a mob boss. The four of them are forced to come up with schemes to raise the money. It ties in a lot of interesting characters in an excellent storyline. Any gangster movie lover needs to own this movie. I also love how the movie was low budget and yet had such high production value. The lighting was simplistic but captivating, and the actors weren't famous, but they fit the parts perfectly. In the bonus materials you learn how they made parts of the movie. They described some of the editing techniques involved like messing with frame rate, a first experience with a stunt man, and shooting with high speed cameras. This movie was Guy Ritchie's second film and so they were pretty new to this and it gives me inspiration because I felt like I could relate to the guys in the bonus features. It showed me that I know how they made it, and I have the ability to make something just as good. You don't need an outrageous Hollywood budget to make cinematic gold.

A brilliant British film,"A wonderful blend of sharp witty humor, plenty of twists that are sure to leave you trying to keep up (and even pausing the movie for a couple of moments just to make sure you actually are up to speed on the whole plot), and of course Guy Ritchie's undeniable style that will capture and enthrall your attention, which always gives his films such a unique feel to them only adding to the overall enjoyment. Oh and some violence thrown in for good measure (what's a good gangster film without violence?). the actors did a convincing job for not being very well known in fact they did a much better job than most of the actors you see in modern films these days. And the story was absolutely hilarious! Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a heist film involving four friends owing a grand some of half a million pounds to a local gangster after he rigs a card game. And now they have only one week to come up with the money or else... and so begins the start of many schemes and brilliant twists that make up this film and only add to the dark hilarity proving it very difficult not to laugh. Even though the humor is much more darker than your average flick (but really is that a bad thing) Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a great Guy Ritchie film and a brilliant debut showcasing his skills in directing a very enjoyable film.

The return of the smart Brit crim flick.,"Kudos to Guy Ritchie for almost single handedly resurrecting the Brit crime flick. Without him there would be no Sexy Beast and no Layer Cake, there would most likely be no Vinnie Jones or Jason Statham either. The intertwining of multiple plot lines has been been before, and most likely he has used Pulp Fiction here as a model. Only his plot is much more involved, his dialogue more believable and his characters more real than any one figure in Tarantino's vehicle. The result is a smart, sassy and savvy film, that takes us into a seedy underworld, where the characters convey more menace with a single look, word or gesture than Pulp Fiction can sustain throughout. As a result l found myself far more engaged and wondering how the story was going to be resolved than in any other crime film l can recall in of the last couple of decades.Bloody excellent stuff.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Very good, but Snatch surpasses it.","This film must show Americans that not all the English speak with posh accents and act in pretentious ways. Whenever I watch an American sitcom or film portraying someone British I find myself on my high horse as hardly anyone speaks in the way they think we do. If we give all Americans this film to watch they will soon realise that England isn't as pretty in pink as they seem to believe. This film is gritty, dark, humorous and filled with all kinds of cockney rhyming slang that Americans would need subtitles. This is the London they all fail to see.The film is about four friends, one of whom Eddy (Moran) is a brilliant card player due to his ability to read people's emotions during a game of cards. Being onto what they believe as a winning deal, the group all pitch in twenty five thousand pound for him to use in an underground card game. Little do they know however that Hatchet Harry, the organiser of the game, doesn't believe in a fair game and cheats his way to taking all Eddy's money and incurring him a five hundred thousand pound debt on top of that. The debt also includes his friends who will all start losing their fingers if they don't repay in seven days. The friends have no idea where to start but manage to overhear their drug dealing neighbours discussing their plan to steal a large amount of money from some incompetent drug dealers. Eddy's plan is to rob these guys once they have robbed the other guys. Meanwhile two antique shotguns have just been priced at three hundred thousand pounds and Hatchet Harry sends two scouse lads in to steal them. Miscommunication construes and Eddy and the gang end up with five hundred thousand pounds worth of cash and two antique shotguns. Breathing down their neck are also the neighbours, the incompetent drug dealers and their dangerous boss, Hatchet Harry and his cronies and Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) who 'collects' for Harry.The film plays out with lots of interweaving plot lines and several twists and turns all filled with irony. Each twist and turn ends up with someone not realising just what they have a hold of. For example the group find themselves in possessions of the guns which would solve all their problems but they have no idea that these guns are actually of some value. Also the two scouse lads tracking down the guns don't realise they are actually hunting down the person they robbed them for in the first place. The plot is completely confusing and will make no sense in writing but to watch it you will see exactly what I mean.The script is fantastic, all the dialogue is realistic and well thought out and the majority of the acting is spot on, especially from Moran, Flemyng, Fletcher and Statham. The opening five minutes set it all up with an Only Fools and Horses style selling technique. Bacon (Statham) is attempting to flog some dodgy jewellery before being chased by the police. The dialogue and acting in this sequence sets us up for the acts to follow and really creates the world that we will be living in for the next two hours. Bravo Mr Ritchie a compelling script you have bought to our attention. One scene that is brilliant is when the neighbours are locked in a cage during the robbery and are being shot at with an air rifle. The whole sequence is fantastic.However the film does have its downfalls. At times there are just too many characters and people are introduced and then disappear for long periods before returning and others show up so late you wander why they were bothered with in the first place. In the end it does all come together but throughout the overuse of characters sometimes makes the plot seem a little disjointed.I personally think this is a very good film but it has to be your cup of tea otherwise you won't enjoy it. It is one of Guy Ritchie's best films but certainly not his best, Snatch gets that award hands down. I believe that if I was reviewing this film in 1998 then I would be more impressed but as I am viewing it after I've seen Snatch particularly, I can't rate it quite as highly. It is a good film but I suggest you watch it before Snatch. That way you will be treated to a very good film followed by a great one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
modern inde-cliche,"This film fits very well into a newly emerged, and stereo-typical, genre: the pop-inde-film. While originality is not the only criteria of importance, it certainly is one. To me this film seems a hybrid ripoff of Quentin Tarantino and Trainspotting. Ooh, junkies and violence (only without the aesthetics and purpose of the aforementioned). There are few redeeming values to this film at all. I really enjoyed (note the sarcasm) the slow motion and ""trippy"" camera work that were used at certain points. They were not the least bit necessary, as they did not reveal anything about the character or the scene. I suppose they were added to look ""cool"" and divert people's attention away from the nothing otherwise happening. Also, was there a single character who was developed in the least? I did not care what happened to any of them at all. 2/10 stars.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Those worried about violence being made to look cool should avoid but otherwise it is slick fun without any substance beyond the plot twists and turns,"Eddy has been good with cards since he was a youth but more than that he is good at reading people. So he makes an agreement with friends Bacon, Tom and Soup to raise the cash to enter the £100k game organised by ""Hatchet"" Harry Lonsdale. Unknown to Eddy, Harry cheats and it isn't long before Eddy is in debt to Harry for losses of £500k. With a week to pay, the four friends are desperate but things look good when Eddy overhears of a weed den run by a handful of former public schoolboys who have lots of cash and lots of drugs. However as they try to get it, the web of gangsters and thieves just gets more and more convoluted.Although he has found out that it cannot produce a career. Guy Richie's debut film is a wonderfully fun piece of silliness and style. The success of this film can be seen in the vast number of inferior copies that came out in the years following Lock, Stock's release but although this is not a strong film, it is very energetic and fun. The script is a mix of characters all spouting exaggerated cockney dialogue in a plot that has plenty of twist and turns but very little depth. This isn't really a problem though because most viewers will come to this knowing what to expect  and few of them will be looking for a serious look at gangsters in London. No, this is nonsense but it is cool, funny and (if you ignore what came after) very fresh.For all his inability to work with serious stories, Ritchie knows how to use a camera and this film is full of visual tricks that work really well. Freeze-frames, slow-mo, different shots etc; yes they are all style without substance but the visual feel of the film is cool. The soundtrack is also really good and works well within the film, never hitting a bum note and always lifting the energy anytime any track plays. The plot is well written in regards the funny dialogue and the slick narrative but those who worry about films making violence and crime look cool should probably just avoid it because this is what it does in the place of substance or moral consideration. Of course this doesn't matter because Ritchie and the cast totally buy into the slick, violent comedy that they are making. Flemyng, Fletcher, Moran and Statham all do well in the lead roles  Statham being my favourite because he introduces the film with his cheeky sales pitch. The support cast are all fun even if some of them are unusual choices. Jones doesn't deserve the fame he got off this film but he is solid here even if his range is limited to say the least. Loads of familiar faces fill out the rest of the cast with good caricatures from Blackwood, McLean, Marcus, Flint and others.As we have seen, it has been difficult for Ritchie or anyone else to repeat the success of this film but for his debut he got it spot on. Although it lacks any sense of morals or character substance it is fresh, funny, violent and, most importantly, fun. Not to everyone's taste of course but cool, slick and enjoyable.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"tom,soap,bacon,and Eddie","I never thought that i would like an English caper comedy,, but once again i was wrong,, delightfully so this time,, Guy Ritchie has come up with a full blown masterpiece of cinema.

One Word Sums this Movie Up- Clever,"Before Jason Statham was a big name action hero With little acting ability ( see Cranked, Transporter 1 & 2) , he had tremendous ability which was best displayed in this tricky little film buy Guy Ritchie. Throw in some all-time likable tough guys like Vinnie Jones Lenny McClean and you have the mix of a good crime drama. The thing is, this wasn't a crime drama. Lock Stock was much more than this, it made me laugh, sweat, act squeamish, and still made me attached to some of it's characters. In my opinion this movie was better then Snatch although Snatch had the big American actor to back it, Brad Pitt. This simple but ingeniously scrapped together story about a mean porn king and a group of underachievers in London taps all the emotions of the viewer. It's a shame Lenny Mclean passed after acting in this film because he was easily one of the true tough SOB's both on and off the set and would have been a great actor for some time.

Deja Vu,"This is the One that Launched the Careers of a One Trick Pony Director, Guy Ritchie, and Actors Jason Statham, and Vinnie Jones. So now You Know what to Blame it All on. Ritchie has Continued to Remake this Movie, Again and Again, in His Now Long and Mediocre Career, and Why Not?It's Influence has been Phenomenal and that in Itself is Phenomenal since this was a Movie Influenced (being polite) by what had Come Before, Mainly Tarantino, Scorsese, but Other Movies to be Sure.The Overrated Director has an Annoying Trait (actually more than one) of Repeating Himself, not just in Other Films, but Within Each Film. For Example, the Overexposed, High Contrast, Gold and Yellow Sepia-Tone Sheen Look (from filming with 16mm) is Cool for about a Scene or Two, but the Director Decides to Film Virtually the Whole Movie in this Glaring Style.Another Example, while the First Half of the Film Uses many Recognizable Pop Tunes (are you getting deja vu) but Once Iggy Pop's ""I Wanna be Your Dog"" is heard, the Guitar Riff Plays Over and Over Again for the Remainder.The Film has Some Fun with the Complications of the Plot as it Folds in on Itself (deja vu ""again""), and there in an Energy here that is Infectious. But the Accents are Thick and may be Hard to Follow, like the Story, so some of the Jokes Might Get Lost in Translation and Add to that, it is Wrapped in a lot of British Slang.Enormously Popular and Highly Overrated, this is One of those that Should be Watched at Least Once just to See what All the Fuss is About, and Once You've Seen it, You Never have to Watch Another Guy Ritchie Movie.

The only film I have ever hated,"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is the most appalling film I have ever had the misfortune to see. It is 105 minutes of macho shaping and people trying to look cool as they headbutt other people. Most of the comments here seem to compare it favourably with Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction and the like. These are great films which Lock Stock... does not deserve a comparison to....the reason films like Reservoir Dogs get away with their amorality is that you are not expected to sympathize with or judge the characters. In Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels you are clearly expected to take the side of some of the cliched yobs which are passed off as characters in this monstrosity. Also the films lacks any of the style, wit, originality, ingenuity or charisma of anything by Tarantino or Scorsese. I had never actually hated a film before I saw this macho, laddish rubbish.

Music adds a nice touch to this great film,"My Age: 13Tom (Tom Flemyng) has always been known as a great card player, so he and his three mates Soap (Dexter Fletcher), Eddy (Nick Moran) and Bacon (Jason Statham) each donate 25,000 pounds for a game with Harry Lonsdale (P.H. Moriarty).  Unfortunately, they end up in debt to Harry and must pay it within a week.  Tom overhears the neighbours talking about taking money from drug growers, and he develops a plan to take the money from them.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a very funny movie and the music in it is great and adds a nice touch to the already great film.

"Incompetence, weed, air rifles, half a million dollars and 2 antique shotguns, What could be better?","This film is one that contains what every low budget film should have. Great dialogue, fantastic plot and colourful characters make this one of the greatest films of the 90s. The dialogue has the nice sharp, to-the-point edge that only British films can give the audience. The local language is used to give audiences a sense of realism. This is the way these people would talk about this stuff. This is an important film as well. It can be likened to Reservoir Dogs in its' effect. Filmmakers see this as a relatively cheap way to make films and achieve career boosting success. But the films biggest credit goes to its use of genre.

Then it all went dreadfully wrong,"Some people prefer the Director's cut of Blade Runner to the original studio release and this preference is largely due to the fact that Ridley Scott removed all the naff voice-over and let the viewers fill in the not-very-difficult to figure out extra plot themselves. I therefore look forward to a future revised version of L S & 2 SBs in which the even naffer and more unnecessary voiceovers are removed. As the film opens with the spiel of a street seller, some highly contrived visuals and a setup requiring the aforementioned naff voiceovers I thought I was in for an episode of Eastenders but with lots of swearing. My heart and several other vital organs began to sink. Happily the film improved very rapidly and I came to understand why it has received such rave reviews elsewhere.The plot revolves around 4 young men who have to raise half a million to pay off a gambling debt. This requires them to rip off a gang who are ripping off a ganja factory being financed by another gang. This is interwoven with a plot concerning the theft to order of two highly valuable antique rifles by a pair of incompetent amateurs. The climactic scenes feature convoluted plot coincidences and an object lesson in Mexican stand-offs. In fact I wouldn't be surprised to learn that the writer and director had been somewhat influenced by Mutt's favourite director, Quentin Tarantino.OK, OK, I'll stop prevaricating and tell you that it is a damn good film. The visuals are great except for some odd effects which look like they belonged in a Vodka advert, the sets are suitably grimy, the script is very very funny as evidenced by a woman two seats away from me who kept distracting me with her constant cackling. The acting is wonderful. Well I say acting though I suspect that much of it is attitude rather than the result of hard thespianism. Vinnie Jones is excellent as the hard man enforcer as is Sting in his role as bar-owner and Eddy's dad . The four lads are cast to perfection as is virtually everyone else in the film. Several dimwit supports show excellent comic timing. The music is dead good too. (Let's see – constant bad language, witty dialogue, Mexican stand-off, excellent casting, cool soundtrack – are we sure director Guy Ritchie is not related to QT?).I still have a few carping reservations. I don't believe real villains in real life talk as sharply or with such biting irony as the characters in this film. Essentially this is another disguised form of the American dream despite being set in England. The four leads are all supercool dudes who we are sure are going to walk through the whole thing unscathed whilst nameless sub-villains are shot to death all around. In a sense we are being invited to imagine that this is us – we are immortal and could come through any scrape like this. Yes, I know it's a black comedy but permit me to be just a little uneasy about it. I enjoyed it a lot but I was also uneasy about the manipulation.Despite my nit-picking reservations this is still an excellent film which I urge you to go and see. If you want to consider it in terms of the fact that it is a British film then it is undoubtedly the best British film in living memory and worth a hundred 4 Weddings and Not the Full Montys.Then it all went dreadfully wrong....",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"""Bad breath, colorful language, feather duster... what do you think they're gonna be armed with?""","After that quote, he goes on to say ""Guns!"" But by saying ""bad breath, colorful language, feather duster.."" he couldn't be more right on. This movie, done by Guy Ritchie, the same guy who would go on to do the similar and equally entertaining Snatch a few years later, is bloody brilliant. With touches of such predecessors as Trainspotting and Reservoir Dogs, Guy Ritchie was able to make a movie that was at the same time thrilling and funny, with exciting visual and narrative style. The plot is confusing and simple at the same time, only because of the abundance of colorfully language characters, who are all stupid. If it's one thing about Guy Ritchie's films it's that his characters are obviously very dumb, but the ones with even the slightest hint of good sense and good morals will come out a little bit less bruised than the rest.

Guy Ritchie certainly knows how to devise contrived and clever plots; the ending was a nice homage to 'The Italian Job'.However, that's where all the praise ends. After a bright start, the film eventually descended into a farce with people shouting at each in silly Cockney accents. Perhaps I've missed the punchline or lost my sense of humour but this film was like an adult version of Scooby Doo with its cartoon violence and characterization.Apart from some touches -ie the slow mo's during the card game - this film had a very made for tv feel about it.

Top Notch Story Telling.  Simply just a great film.,"There's no question that Guy Ritchie can tell a good story, but throw all of those wacky and interesting characters in the mix and it becomes great. That is just what he did. To work with all of the characters that he wrote himself and know exactly what to do with them all just shows the leadership, dedication, and skill of a great writer/director. And all in his first major movie!Since the characters were so well written and placed within an awesome storyline, it's obvious that all of the actors would have to work off of each other to make themselves better, which they did. The characters' problems and their ways of coming about solutions involving, simply guns and a plan really works out for excellent entertainment.

Classic stylish British gangster movie among the best,"This movie is up there with (Caine's) ""Get Carter"" and ""The Long Good Friday"" as my favourite British gangster movies. However it is vastly different from those two eg. voice-overs, black humour (throughout and very funny), the central characters are not vicious killers. However the gangsters are evil nasty characters (I love the way one practices his golf), the plot has many twists (the ending is a classic!) and various seemingly unrelated groups move inexorably closer as the end nears. There are some violent scenes and there is swearing so it's not a ""G"" rating. Guy ""Mr Madonna"" Ritchie's direction and feel is excellent as is the involved plot with interlinked ""stuff-ups"". In this movie he works the new movie genre: a stylish humorous gangster movie. There are Tarantino similarities but this movie stands up on its own. A classic worth the watch.

Another surprising fact was the movie was full of a bunch of relative unknown actors, besides Sting if he counts, and they all pulled of their parts brilliantly with plenty of depth.

Pointless.,"What was the point of that? I'm going to go do my laundry.End of review. 0/10.Okay, I really wish I could end there, because that's all the credit Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels deserves. It's one of the few movies I've even seen that is so bad it's actually below me to sit here and write a negative review. I've watched a lot of overrated films, but I've never once gone as far as to call a single movie ""The Most Overrated Film of All Time"", simply because there are a lot of movies that could be called that. Naming one single movie ""The Most Overrated Film of All Time"" is just ludicrous. But I am seriously reconsidering my own line of logic right now and giving this film that title. That is how much I simply cannot understand the hype and mass love for this film. At all. It's like a movie that should be on the bottom 100 movies of all time, but then somehow, some way, it gets loved by the public. I simply can't comprehend it.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a generic film noir piece set in a generic film noir world with generic film noir ""quirky"" characters and a generic film noir plot. Everything, every last thing, is copy/pasted from otherbettermovies. Critics trash movies all the time for even minor unoriginality, yet this has to be one of the most unoriginal movies of all time and it's critically acclaimed? It's impossible not to see the unabashed rip-off scenes from Pulp Fiction, most notably. Not to mention the Reservoir Dogs inspired scenes. By the middle of the movie I literally forgot which wannabe Quentin Tarantino movie I was watching, because I've seen so many of them they all just blur together because they're all basically the same movie. They all repeat the same variations of Pulp Fiction quotes. They all have the same basic drug-kill-money plot. They all think they're so genius because they have one sub-par plot twist that isn't even a plot twist because we expect it in movies like this.Look, I like film noir, too, but I don't love everything just because it's a stylish crime movie. It has to be different. Film noir started back in the 40s, and I think it says something when the only few films in the genre that become anything more than a small cult success are the ones that are truly genre-defining and added much-needed originality to the genre, not the ones that just tag around the bandwagon. In other words, I can see some people possibly finding Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels entertaining if you're a genre fan. But overrating it to the point that its at is simply stupid. It's generic. It's exactly like everything you've seen before. It's just a frozen McDonald's hamburger in the generic fast food storehouse. Get over it.If you're not a film noir fan, don't bother watching it at all. You'll fall asleep. If you are, and you're in a good mood, I suggest you try it. If the first five minutes bore you as much as they did me, just know that the rest of the movie doesn't get any better. The jokes are the same jokes you've heard in all the other genre pieces. There is nothing good that can be said about the acting. Some of it is borderline terrible. It isn't cool. The pansy camera cutting away from every single act violenceeven as tame a punch in the mouth!gets so annoying I wished more than once I could turn it off. It isn't cool.There isn't a single thing about this movie that is likable or entertaining unless you get it up by watching generic middle-aged men trying to be cool.I'm done.This film noir fan has officially given up on the entire genre. I'm done. Instead of ripping-off Pulp Fiction a hundred more times, why don't directors actually do what Pulp Fiction did? Bring originality to the tired genre.0/10",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Take a butchers!,"If you want to dee a great, distinctly British, film, take a butchers at this. Comparisons to Pulp Fiction are fair but the films are different, especially as this is set in a fictional east-end London. They both show a strange underworld which probably doesn't exist, but this film is much more amusing (Pulp Fiction doesn't have a guy being beaten to death with a dildo). Some may find the end annoying (I wont spoil it for you) and you Yanks will have trouble understanding it (Trainspotting was a different accent, this is in a different language) but if you do watch it I guarantee you will be laughing out loud. The violence is brutal but mainly off screen but anyone who can't stand strong language would be advised not to see the film, as most of the dialogue is unrepeatable in good company.Basically the film is great fun, so get on the dog&bone and take a butchers with your mates.

One of the best crime films,"Among movies in the crime genre, this is one of the best. It exudes an air of coolness through the whole movie and it is what makes it so cool. Besides, of course, the snappy dialogue, the wonderful characters, and the dark humor that are all in this film.It's about four guys who all pool their money to play a game of poker, only to end up losing and owing a lot of money to a crime bigwig. This plot remains fast-paced and fresh throughout the film, wasting no time in bringing out the next scene. The ultra-fast method they deliver their lines also plays into the movie's strong points. It becomes almost incomprehensible at times, but it's all okay because it is such a cool way of going through the movie. It also contains a kind of humor in it, the kind that persuades you to laugh at all of their hopeless situations and blunderings.

For God's sake look at the film in its own right and don't judge it by how close it comes to a Tarantino.  It's got nothing to do with Tarantino - it's a London film exploring London themes not a Resevoir Dogs wannabe.And as for one US comment about Brit directors should watch less MTV - do me a favour mate, Brit directors are class, the whole world knows it (including Hollywood who regularly pay homage to the UK when not jinxed by a bout of jingoism at the Oscars).

Basically, it's a comedy that's chock-full of violence, but fortunately not graphic violence.  The lead characters are very likable and there's a real feeling of camaraderie between them.  I loved the stoners and ""Big Chris"" and ""Little Chris"" and all the incidental details that gave the story a lived-in texture.  Granted, the plot doesn't bear close inspection and won't stay with you very long, but that doesn't take away from the pleasures of this movie.

So what?,"I'll make this commentary short.  ""So what?"" is my reaction to this movie. The film made absolutely no attempt to make me care about any of the characters except for...Chris?

I laughed approximately five times in this dark comedy.Which is depressing, because I am likely their target audience.  I love dark comedies and B-films.  I've endured cardboard characters in such films as Robot Monster, Crocodile (the Thailand one), and Troma's War.  I have nothing against foriegn movies--they're usually better than American films. But no, not here.Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels just sits there.  You just sit there. You look at it.  It continues to sit there.  This movie doesn't achieve anything.

Ultimate gangster comedy!,"This is the ultimate gangster comedy. It contains guns, gangs and blood but it also contains a marvelous direction and many funny quotes.

Excellent soundtrack including rock, jazz and even folk (i am from Greece and i love ""Zorbas"" during a battle). Guy Ritchie makes a fantastic work directing so the cast does. It's not just a movie for laughs, it's a masterpiece of action/comedy and showing us that Guy Ritchie is not just the husband of Maddona.

Trainspotting/Tarantino hybrid,"Frankly, I don't understand all the complaints about the accents in this film.  As an American, I had to really listen close to catch certain segments of the dialogue, but that was part of the charm of the characters. It may help to view the Cockney Rhyming Glossary on the DVD beforehand to get the gist of the slang ahead of time.This film has a bit of Tarantino in it but it isn't nearly as serious as Reservoir Dogs.  Although bloody, it isn't particularly gory.  It maintains a whimsical perspective throughout its length as the various parallel subplots throughout the film suddenly clash together in a satisfying climax.The characters are all quite entertaining as they seem to maintain a perfect balance of realism and cartoon-like qualities.Overall, an entertaining film, funny script, and a well-conceived story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Have a butcher's at this, mates","Guy Ritchie's debut, ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", is a British gangster film that invites comparison to the early works of Quentin Tarantino. The story revolves around four working class blokes who get saddled with a half a million pound debt and have a week to come up with the cash before they start losing appendages.The story is an inventive one, snaking its way through numerous twists and turns, eventually arriving at a satisfying conclusion. The script contains plenty of humour and the British setting gives American audiences a fairly unique experience. That being said, those who have trouble with accents may find the dialogue a little hard to follow, particularly since there's some Cockney rhyming slang mixed in.The cast is a well-chosen, authentic bunch. There aren't really any standout performances but there aren't really any sub-standard ones either. That being said, I could have done without Sting but at least his role is only a minor one.Ritchie's direction is energetic and employs a multitude of cinematic techniques. Occasionally his stylization goes a bit overboard but overall he exercises enough restraint to keep the story moving briskly. The film shows its low-budget roots in the visuals but that doesn't matter much since the grimy look suits the subject matter well. The soundtrack is another key element in that it contains a number of excellent cuts that go a long way in establishing the film's tone.All in all, this is a quality gangster film, albeit one that mixes in a heavy dose of comedy with its crime. Comparisons to Tarantino are warranted but, in my opinion, it would be a disservice to dismiss Ritchie as a mere copycat. There's real inventiveness here, as demonstrated once again in the stylistically similar (and arguably superior) follow-up, ""Snatch"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

One of the bests crime movies ever,"Actually a summary was going to be ""A British version of Mean Streets"" because I found this movie having many similarities with Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets and I think that Guy Ritchie was inspired by this film, but actually Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels has overcome Mean Streets (and I think nowadays it is also better know than Mean Streets). You never know what to expect from Guy Ritchie, this movie is half a black comedy and he's making fun of all of his characters, even the toughest ones, so it's a really entertaining movie. I also heard that Guy Ritchie was inspired bay Quentin Tarantino, but in Tarantino's movies the dialogs are more intellectual, in Guy Ritchie's movies the dialogs are more street-like.

For example, one character is called Nick the Greek, but sometimes he is known as ""Nick the Bubble."" No explanation is given in the film, but 'Bubble' is cockney rhyming slang for 'Greek'.

An All-Time Great in the Heist/Crime Comedy Genre,"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is a stylish, witty, and fast-paced comedy that spans every level of the London criminal underworld. The film is centered on four friends who pool their money so that one of them can enter a high-stakes back-room poker game. Eddie (Nick Moran), a natural at reading the most minute involuntary reactions, is convinced he can't lose. The game has been rigged against him, however, and what looked like a sure thing ends with Eddie and his friends in debt to a local crime boss and purveyor of pornography named Hatchet Harry. Now these three petty criminals (and one aspiring chef named Soap who's always managed to keep his hands clean) have one week to come up with £500,000 or Harry's enforcer will start taking their fingers.This is writer and director Guy Ritchie's first time at the helm of a feature film, but he expertly guides us through a labyrinth of schemes and characters without the viewer becoming lost in the details. And there is a lot going on in this movie. Multiple interconnected plots dance around each other as thugs, street-corner jewelry hucksters, drug dealers, and crime lords all scheme against one-another. Ritchie makes excellent use of the camera and of music. When Eddie staggers away from the poker game finding himself impossibly deep in debt to a very dangerous man, the scene takes on a surreal yet panicked mood that puts the viewer right in the character's shoes. Looking directly into his face as he makes his way out, you're drawn in and feel his world crashing down around your own shoulders. The slick soundtrack of blues and rock adds to the effect of immersion, setting a rhythm for the action on screen.The cast members turn in strong performances all around. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels marks the feature film debuts of Jason Statham and Vinnie Jones, both of whom would go on to become well-known actors in the genre. Sting also turns in a memorable cameo appearance as Eddie's father.There is a fair bit of violence and quite a lot of foul language. While it doesn't descend into being vulgar simply for shock value, there is more than sensitive viewers are likely to be able to overlook. For fans of this genre, however, this film is one of the very best. It's funny, full of surprises, and engaging right up to the very end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

The comedy is bound to the plot and action of the movie and it never feels forced: and that's what great comedies do, they never hurry the laugh out of you. I'm talking more about the comedic part because when it comes to style, well, I feel I only have insufficient experience to describe the visual style of Guy Ritchie - whirling, reeling, spinning, dramatic tension and comedic relief.My only problem with the movie was that the first part seemed a tad convoluted.

So with the obvious similarities aside, it is safe to say that Guy Ritchie's movie has brought new life and new twists to the genre, and succeeded where so many other clones have failed.  Some of the reviews I read before seeing this movie complained of a plotline too complicated and dialogue too accent thick as hindrances to understanding the movie.  Three things, first of all, don't underestimate the audience, I had no trouble following the plotline. Anyone who watches Seinfeld, with its separate plotlines coming together at the end, will get it.  The accents I got used to quickly, Amercian audiences loved Trainspotting which had even thicker accents, so that's not a problem. Lastly, complete understanding of the plotline is secondary in a movie like this.

"Completely ridiculous, but loads of fun","I can totally see why this film has such a great reputation. It's quick-on-its-feet (well, once the first forty minutes or so have passed), violent and also doesn't take itself too seriously. in fact, I'd say this is as much of a comedy as it is a crime drama. The situations the characters get themselves in are pretty absurd, and the whole thing hinges on coincidence and a kind of wild spiralling-out-of-control-of-circumstance taht, although a bit unbelievable, just works for telling this kind of story.What's more, the script is witty as hell and absolutely bursting with great one-liners and scathing put-downs. I found the cadence of the dialogue to be almost lulling, and all the actors delivered their lines with convictiona nd clarity that I find lacking in some of the US films of similar type. Nevertheless, I think fans of the Breaking Bad TV series might enjoy this, as I found some of the elements to be similar, and, as in taht series, at times I felt like I was watching an episode of The Three Stooges instead of a serious crime flick. That's not meant to be a slag against BB or this movie, but just a reflection of just how absurd these things can get.And really, I think the absurdity is rather welcome. Crime movies can be such dreary affairs nowadays; I think the levity is appreciated. Also, no police characters, just a bunch of hoods and old-timer crooks with names like ""Soap"", ""Bacon"", ""Barry the baptist"" and ""Dog"". I can't think of a bad performance here and even Sting, of all people, has a small role and doesn't let the side down (god, I'll never forget him in Dune!).The music is all extremely well-chosen rock and soul tunes, too, and I dug all of it, especially the james Brown and Stooges. The whole film feels very honest and sincere despite its general silliness, and I enjoyed the hell out of it.

Tons of fun,"I'm no Guy Ritchie supporter or anything and therefor in reviewing this film I remain more objective than some might be. This here is a heavily English action-comedy, I emphasize its country of origin as some might be too foreign to its cultural tinge and should be mindful of that during its viewing. Slang, talking speed, the attitudes overall...it's definitely different, and this film wasn't made to be a polished flavorless ready-to-sell-internationally item. It's authentic, rough in places but never too much and showcases an effortless (and surprising ?) balance of humor and comedy, along with hard-hitting, raw action. Its main plot is uber simple, but that's totally fine. In fact, it makes it better. Because now the movie has its trigger and the movie-makers can focus on all the rest: the little subplots, the humor, involving other characters and parties to the core of the story, before unleashing an ultimate climax at the end that is, again, very simple, almost too simple; and yet, at the risk of sounding over-complacent, it works - fits that story and mood perfectly.

"If you like off-the-wall British movies, you'll love this one.","The DVD version is very well done, sharp video transfer and good soundtrack, but you need a system with a subwoofer to get the full benefit from ""mood"" music.This is *not* a movie for those looking for a nice story and a message.  The characters are all crooks.  They beat and shoot each other. They plot to steal each others' money and guns. They use drugs.  They have no morals. My wife walked out half-way, but she doesn't usually like British movies.However, if you can get past all that, there is lots of funny stuff in this movie.

You're all wrong - it's terrible!,"The praise which has been heaped upon Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels is more an indicator of the power of hype than anything else - the film is just plain awful! It is so frustrating to see how the media have built it up so much that people are afraid to declare it a pile of poo, for fear of being uncool...I present my case thus: 1) the acting is almost uniformly dreadful - real school play stuff. Can anyone out there honestly say that this is otherwise? 2) the script is equally crap. The story is an amalgamation of every gangster film you've ever seen, totally unoriginal, and the characters are so jaw-droppingly cliched as to stagger belief! I could just about take the Cockney wide boys, the naive students and the nasty neighbours, but what on earth were those two Northerners all about????? 3) I'm told that there were elements of comedy in the film - I, frankly, found it as amusing as those terrible, bland sitcoms we Brits are so good at making these days. I've seen more sophisticated humour in an episode of Sesame Street! 4) and the direction was way over the top - if you want to know how to be flash, Mr Ritchie, I suggest you go back and watch the real masters (again, since you so obviously pinched many bits straight from the likes of Scorsese..!).In conclusion, it's no points for LS&TSB, and a bottle of cider for the marketing men, who seemed to convince enough of you that this was a ""with it"" film.Cool? There's more cool in a single frame of Get Carter, or The Long Good Friday than in the neverending 105 minutes of this rubbish...Say ""NO"" to peer pressure, and admit the unmistakable truth about this awful piece of work!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Schlock, Rock and Two Boring Hours","""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrells"" is just out on video, and what with the glowing reviews and comparisons to a personal favorite ""Pulp Fiction,"" I was really looking forward to this British film a lot. Boy, was I disappointed! This movie has a needlessly complex plot dealing with mobsters, poker losses, pot growers and a bloody hiest. I had a hard time following the plot, mostly because this move is way too talky. Yes, I know, Tarantino also writes talky movies, but at least I find his dialoge entertaining. If this film's talk is as smart and witty as Quentin's, I certainly didn't get it.

Every performance fitted well and was a very satisfying watch. The ending could have been a little more satisfactory but some people find happiness in unifished endings so be it.So many lives get intertwined in the movie's plot and is so delightful to watch. It sucks you in and then spit you out only at the end. Guy Ritchie is a master of situational comedy after Edgar Wright. Well, we see some of Guy Ritchie in Edgar Wright, but the latter has made a reputation quite recently and have made far better movies and the former dabbled in some flops.All in all, it always feels good to see either Snatch or Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrelss.

Insight,"While many critically acclaim Snatch as Richie's better piece of work, those who followed the director pre-madonna would realise, with little cognative thought processing, that Lock, Stock is art.

Introducing 'Clever-Comic-Crime-Noir' Genre designed by Guy Ritchie and British Cinema.,"Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels (1998) :
Brief Review -Introducing 'Clever-Comic-Crime-Noir' Genre designed by Guy Ritchie and British Cinema. Which are those rare flicks where i laughed on clever jokes, Smart situations and Twists that had me in them, well this is it. Lock, Stock And Two Smoking is a Crime Film that doesn't have a single tensed moment and that too by not loosing the seriousness of the Crime World. Seriously, it is Funny but more funny thing is it's ""Serious Funny"". I am probably using such adjective for the first time and funnily i am honoured. I'm not much familiar with British Cinema but recently i saw ""Trainspotting"" and found it a cleverly written smacky-whacky ride and since then i was looking for another British film having same flavour. The search ended today when a saw Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels. The story is a whole lotta mess actually having so many characters, situations, plans and business deals involved but all of them crosses each other's paths and the Chaos turns into a Fine Laughing Therapy. It ain't just an adult comedy but it is very intelligently written script and believe me this is one hell of a writing piece that makes you laugh in Crime genre yet doesn't lose it's own seriousness and gravity. The acting is not a great thing about this film but the dialogue delivery by every actor is something i liked more. ""It was Emotional"", a quote comes from a Hilarious film, so, you know what i mean by the dialogue writing. One more fine thing in the writing is it doesn't have any Female character except for one smacky cameo. You know many crime films have lost the essense because of useless Romance and unnecessary inclusion of Dames, thank god there was no such weak side here. This Guy Ritchie's directorial debut have been influencial and i don't wonder why. British Cinema invents a new genre in this highly entertaining flick and i am awe-bound. A Cult Classic!RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
One long music video,"Think Guy Ritchie used all his good ideas at once in this film, and it still stinks. The whole movie is like a series of visual set pieces and bad dialogue linked together with an adequate but boring plot. I think the success of this film was that it's visual style appealed to wealthy teenagers from Surrey and Kent who like to think they are sharp dressed ""cockney geezers"" despite the fact they wouldn't dare go to East London for fear of being robbed.For me Michael Caine is one of the worst actors Britain has ever produced, so to be expected to sit through Nick Moran's terrible Caine impression is an insult to actors everywhere.The constant stream of poor retro cockney gangster films (Snatch, Rancid Aluminium etc...), and cheeky northern comedies about unemployment (Billy Elliot, Brassed Off, Full Monty) are taking British films to new lows.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Eventually when it aired i sat there moodily watching, after 2 minutes my moody face was no more and i had the biggest grin on my face. Laugh after laugh after laugh, Tom (Tom Flemyng) gets the best lines but each character has the ability to make you laugh while still being credible.The only thing that is stopping me from giving it a ten is that there is a few pointless scenes.

"Cheap, shallow and British--what's not to like?","Apparently, there are a few things not to like about Guy Ritchie's ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"". This is a film whose ugliness and gaucherie make it work, but despite being made by a director who developed a trademark style, the screenwriting gets in the way of what could have potentially been a masterpiece. But without getting off on the wrong foot, let me tell you that this film offers nearly scene after scene of humor, all driven by the incompetence of its characters.Guy Ritchie feels like a Quentin Tarantino who suddenly decided that he fancies a warm pint of lager in some Ye Olde Pub to an American Dukes of Hazard or a regional Martin Scorsese who, after spending two weeks in the UK, would lower his standards. This is a director who fully encapsulates the cheapness and piss-off-ery of London thugs with indecipherable accents and about as indecipherable of a plot. In the end, it all pays off, though, as the plot complicates so much that even its characters are caught on the wrong foot and the film explodes into a ridiculous and funny climax. All these thugs are pretty much carbon copies of each other (as if the plot isn't hard enough to follow) and their actions and motives feel rather basic to their job. The only ones that stand out are the four main friends: Eddy (Nick Moran), Bacon (Jason Statham), Soap--because he was clean, legit (Dexter Fletcher) and Tom--boring name, by the way (Jason Flemyng).Even if the characters' shallowness feels like the film lacks a certain meaning and makes it difficult for us to relate with anyone, it is a good thing that Ritchie at least went all the way with it. I mean, imagine how cringy it would have been if Eddy had found out that the local gang-land boss, Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarty) was cheating at the poker game and justice would have been served or whatever. No morality here as the inevitable end of most of these gangsters comes simply from stupidity which makes it funny and the fact that you don't really connect with any of them makes it even more effective.An interesting observation is that the streets are often empty, unlike Scorsesian pictures in which the entire environment is aware, Ritchie takes a deader approach. Every frame is devout of any extras except some rare scenes in the bar or two random people talking to each other in one scene. It almost feels as if Ritchie put this characters into a maze-like world as he examines their interactions but it's not that. These are not that type of characters and this is not that type of film. Unpretentious and simple yet complex, this shouldn't even have such a long review.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
VERY POOR,"I missed this at the cinema, but heard many good things from my friends about this. I finally caught it on Sky last Saturday, and what an overrated film I saw. The film didn't contain a decent actor to take the lead, and comprised rejects from 'The Bill', sitcoms and Wimbledon F.C. The film didn't contain an original idea, and stole shamelessly from 'Reservoir Dogs', 'Trainspotting', 'Goodfellas', 'Only Fools & Horses' and 'The Italian Job'. The humour and stereotypes were like a bad episode of 'Minder'. It was shot in a grainy stock to compare with some of the British 70s classics. However this most certainly is not a 'Get Carter' or 'The Long Good Friday'. It was more a wet dream for FHM readers.

Eddie and his three friends have seven days to find the money to pay off the debt, or face the consequences.It seems a little crass to state the bleeding obvious, but Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels is the British blood brother to Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. It's also that particular films equal and the best, and most successful, of the post Dogs imitations. Guy Ritchie's first full length picture has a knowing vitality about it, oddly seeming fresh even tho it harks back to crime movies back in yore. The plot plays out as an amalgamation of crooks and wide boy Londoners whizz around robbing and beating each other with care free abandon, all of course armed with cockney swagger to go with their respective weapons. On the surface it looks quite complex in structure, but Ritchie ties it all together with brio and a sheer belief that these characters are capable of winning over the audience. And they do. The violence in the piece is tough and at times wince inducing, but another laugh, or a beggars belief scene is just around the corner, and on it goes. Till the collage unfolds and the ending is nigh, and here Ritchie gives us the final nudge in the ribs to close the sale of the century. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Overhyped confusing movie,"I watched this movie again recently after many years. It was entertaining enough as an evening's viewing, but afterwards I was left scratching my head, genuinely not understanding the hype - on any level. The best thing is probably the soundtrack.The acting is abysmal. It makes Vinnie Jones' acting look good. It doesn't help the actors the script is abysmal. (Michael Caine can get away with being a bad actor because at least he has some charisma). The casting was bad because in addition to crap actors, in a plot with way too many characters, none of them developed, you need them to stand out visually from each other. With the exception of the Scousers and Hatchett Harry, they don't. I was grateful one actor, at least, had a high pitched voice and pony tail, because I found myself lost not knowing who the hell everyone was much of the time.I note the script was written by Guy Ritchie - any other script writer and the film wouldn't have got made or would have had considerably more development first - exactly what it needed - for plot , character and dialogue. That and a bit more rehearsal time for the actors so they didn't sound like they were delivering lines at a read through. I'm a Londoner so didn't have any problems UNDERSTANDING the dialogue, but all the characters sounded the same - none speak in a unique voice. Same flat characters (with absolutely no development or back story) in dull monotone voices delivering what is supposed to be witty dialogue full of one liners.... when EVERYBODY sounds like that it sounds like a pretentious script writer trying to be cool, clever and failing miserably. Far better imo to have one character doing the witty one liners for impact.The Scousers can be funny at times - I don't care about stereotypes) but they could have been even funnier by toning it down a bit. The British are known for subtlely, and I think that's what this movie needed to make it into the cracker of a film it could have been.The plot is confusing with way too many characters we can't follow running around, many things happening for the sake of happening. I think there was one woman in the whole film. Not sure they even employed female extras. Much of the plot is thin and cookie cooker, ripped off from other movies. The violence is not funny and it's not shocking either. It's pointless. It fails miserably on all front. As for style, Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dog, Train Spotting etc s it is not. It failed on the styling front for me too - costume wise and cinematically.Perhaps it did so well at the time due to hype and the lack of cool British gangster films at the time. Watch it for something to watch by all means, but not for a piece of great British cinema, because that's most definitely what it is not.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Funny, Funny, Funny","This film is one of the best I have seen.  It's a refreshing change from the kind of unoriginal Hollywood action films that are always released.  The plot is so confusing it took loads of people two times to understand it, and the way it portrays Cockney Gangsters is brilliant.  Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) is the best character, followed by the Traffic Warden, and the two useless fat gangsters who initially steal the antique shotguns.  The best scene is the one where the girl (who had been asleep) picks up a 5ft long machine gun and empties the magazine.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Brilliant more fun than any movie i have seen!!! With the exception of I.D,"This film is too good for words to be honest but im gonna write some anyway!

The script is brilliant the story line full of twists and add that to a really talented cast of actors and you've got a real classic. The most effective scene in the movie is when Vinny Jones (Big Chris) goes crazy after his son is held at gunpoint by the main chracters gangster neighbour and slams his head in the door time and time again.I don't think this film is anything like Pulp fiction as some people have claimed, for a start its 100 times better and English.

I can understand how it wouldn't quite hit the mark with all viewers, given its delivery is quintessentially 'gritty' and at times almost sounds ad-libbed. I've found this with a lot of British and Australian films. The 'unpolished' dialogue is something I'm used to, while others seem to see it as 'amateur'.While it's a bit of a slow burn, the crescendo was quite entertaining and I couldn't help but chuckle at the ending. I'm also a sucker for rhyming slang, which is littered throughout the film.Favourite line: 'No can do''Is that close to Kathmandu? Meet me halfway will ya'Also interesting to see people drew similarities to Reservoir Dogs... personally don't see it all that much - those citing the parallels between the quartet of men to the six(?) in Tarantino's film may be stretching a little bit.All in all, enjoyable but not for everyone is how I'd pitch it.

The photography is fantastic, with the sepia look adding to the atmosphere of the film.

Didn't live up to critics' rave reviews...,"Despite a decent plot and dialogue, this film did almost nothing for me with the exception of irritating me tremendously.  Of the cast, at least three were blatant Steve Buscemi mimics while another might as well have been a contestant in a Dennis Leary wannabe contest.  The characters seem to be overtly modeled, directly mind you, after characters from Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs.  Overall the movie seemed like a weak attempt at matching Tarentino's genius character development from those films. Not to mention the less obvious Kubrick rip off with their version of Nadsat (the dialect used in Clockwork Orange).  During one scene a bartender is telling a story using a dialect consisting of words meaning things other than their conventional definitions.  While this definitely has potential, as Kubrick demonstrated, the director chose to use subtitles for the bartender's dialect so the audience would be better able to understand him. It could have been better if a similar dialect was used throughout the movie and the audience was forced to learn the language in order to understand the dialogue. Aside from these irritating facets of the movie, it was generally good. The plot shifts were creative as was the overall cinematography.  I might have given it a 6 or 7 based on the plot, but because of the rip off characters and dialogue, I have to give it a 4.  It's worth seeing if you don't think you'll have similar grievances as I did, but if you watch a lot of movies, this will probably serve to annoy you as much as it did me.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
In one word: Class,"Lock,Stock and Two smoking barrels is a unique movie. It combines comedy, violence, action, money,spectacular camera effects (that give it a cool, dark arty feel, but not too much so-the card game) more comedy,  great moral values and of course drinking. It contains a nice selection of upcoming stars and some old favorites (I include Vinnie Jones, because he was absolutely amazing. It was emotional...) You may have to be English to appreciate the humor, but a lot of my American friends enjoyed it in the same sense that they like Bottom and Red Dwarf.

A must see film!,A classic British movie with classic British style. What should have been a crime underworld action movie was a comedic action film with enough twists to confuse the best of movie goers. The story is a great view into the older British crime machine. The actors make that story come to life in such a beautiful way. The cinematography brings you right into all of the action. Four Young criminals getting in way over their head in a world they are only aware of on the peripheral. Does this movie end with a happy ending? You have to watch the movie and wonder.

Guy Ritchie brings it home,"Ritchie's feature film debut and very similar in themes and outlook to his next film, Snatch. A film about dubious criminals, simple souls, odd happenstances, bloody brutality and tongue-in-cheek crime comedy.The story goes that a group of four friends end up owing money to the biggest, meanest and baddest crime lord in town. To solve this conundrum they decide to rob their next door neighbours, who just happen to be gangsters planning a big heist against a local bunch of weed cultivators. There's also a pair of antique shotguns floating around. Hence the name.Ritchie's signature flair shines through even this early on. The film is full of inventive camera angles, nonchalant character reactions and certain attitude that to me resembles an odd mixture of pro wrestling and 40s pulp adventure. Everyone, and I mean everyone, is a Character with a capital C. Everyone is playing a role, everyone is posturing, yet everyone is at least a bit clueless and oddly sincere in their interactions. It's at the same time ridiculous and utterly endearing.Still, compared to Snatch, this is a lesser film. The plot is nowhere near as snappy, the cinematography doesn't have the reproductive organs to go all the way and for some reason the whole film uses this awful brown filter, which makes the film look like it crawled through the London sewer system.Is it worth a watch? Absolutely! It's just that Snatch pulls it off even better. Watch both if you can, but if you can only watch one, this is not the one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"really good, took a while to get interesting 7\10","Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a good film by Guy Ritchie. it took me personally a while to understand the plot until it got interesting, I believe one of the flaws is with all the minor characters who don't do much and don't serve the film.

The way the camera fits in with the mood of the scene, music, and actors is with such perfect coordination, its easy to forget your're watching a TV screen. On a side note, the music was good too. The story is about 4 crooks in London trying to get something more out of life. They try to beat cards with local crime kingpin Harry, but fate turns against them, and they have to get £500,000 in 7 days, or face nasty consequences. This sparks an entire trail of events, flipping over from one person with their goals to the next, all coming together in the end for an explosive ending, which will leave you dumbfounded.

An Unflinching Barrel of Laughs!,"In their attempts to get out of a jam, the four East End lads seem to be digging themselves deeper into a hole. They decide to pony up a wad of cash and send in their best card player, to a high stakes game in order to bring home some gold. However, their host Hatchet Harry has rigged the game to rook the lads for all they're worth and by the end of the evening, they're half a million in debt. In order to repay Harry, the four hatch a new plan to intercept a shipment of drugs. What follows next is a hilarious series of accidental double- crosses, botched heists and other bungled crimes. And the violence, while always nerve-wracking, is more implied than graphically depicted. Part of the fun of the film is trying to figure out who, if anyone, will be left standing.The plot is very clever and has a delirious pace that threatens to draw you from your seat at every turn as the fortunes of the protagonists change in flashes, from sky-high to rock bottom. Thus begins a violent, dangerous and funny ride to the unexpected conclusion of the film. Ritchie's camera work is sprightly, and he has a definite rhythm for slang and profanity in his dialogue. His artistic use of freeze- frames, slow motion and other camera trickery proves he is a precocious talent to be reckoned with. He orchestrates the plots and anti-plots with the delight of a sadistic child. Even when the accents are as indecipherable as the plot, Ritchie keeps the action percolating and the humor on high.This movie is loaded with a troupe of unforgettable larrikins, played with boisterous enthusiasm by a solid, ensemble cast particularly the four who make up the lead quartet of Moran, Flemyng, Fletcher and Statham - they are hilariously dazzling, playing complete screw-ups with believable camaraderie and a kind of goofy charm. They're losers sure, but you will find yourselves rooting for them through every twist and turn.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels works beautifully as an exercise in joyful anarchy, an unsentimental roller-coaster ride that is both violent and funny.

Guy Ritchie Begins,"This movie is what launched Guy Ritchie's career and for good reason even if it's his debut movie as well. I can tell Ritchie is a fan of Quentin Tarantino or at least inspired by his work cause this movie has certain elements that seem like it was inspired by Tarantino. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing in some cases including this one. What drives this movie is the over the top and snazzy dialogue despite the constant profanity. The plot is simple but goes in a slightly convoluted direction. In fact for some viewers it maybe difficult to understand what is exactly going on when viewing for the first time. Mainly because it has multiple different group of people, each group having their own story but later comes together in one melting pot. The plot includes hustlers, thieves, loan sharks and gangsters but they are all after one thing and that is money. In fact most of the movie revolves around the characters bickering, arguing and fighting each other for money while using some flashy and witty British dialogue. The dialogue sometimes even has some pretty good humor in it, the black comedy aspect of this movie really works and doesn't seem forced at all. Lot of the good humor comes from the awkwardness of certain situations though. The plot isn't all that coherent and seem over the place at times, but the good dialogue is able to back that up. This movie shows that being a fanboy and getting inspiration from other people's work can create something very watchable as long as they don't plagiarize. Since there is a difference between inspiration and just plain copying in a very secretive manner. If you wanna watch a movie about bunch of guys quarreling over money in a entertaining manner in a sort of Tarantino style fashion, this movie might be for you. This is one of those movies where the build up is most definitely worth it when it comes to the finale. This isn't a artistic movie or has any morals but if you want a movie with a good blend of violence and profanity this one just might be for you.7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

If there is any discernable ""message"" in this wacky ""loveable loser"" style caper it is that criminals are stupid and mean. Tarantino always seems smitten by his criminals, therefore his movies always seem to be trying hard to make us like or understand them. In my opinion, this usually backfires. In the Ritchie movie, there is no reverence for these underworld characters. His mean characters are really nasty bullies so instinctively you do root for and even like the bumbling heroes - at least, you hope they don't get shot down.

Also the cinematography left something to be desired, it was not really to my liking. But I can appreciate why this is viewed as a seminal work by many, however I feel that it is somewhat overrated.

And Doug Liman did it with Swingers in 1996. I am talking about what these brillant men did with their first films, and many of them went on to even more acclaim.

ONe of the great films of the year..,"I rented Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels the day it arrived. Having been a small release, I hadn't gotten to a theater to check it out. I did rent it with a little bit of reluctance, having rented the hideously overrated Go the evening before. Go was considered to be the greatest of the Tarantino knock offs. However, after watching the film, my reluctance had no place because this is not a Tarantino knock off. Ritchie himself said he has never seen Tarantino's brillant Reservoir Dogs. That's not the purpose here, though. The purpose here is to tell how well crafted this film is. To give you an idea, I have never seen a film that had such a clear sense of style and storytelling. Ritchie has defined his sort of hyperkinetic flashy style, and gives us more of a shot with his control of the camera{which is more like a seasoned pro then a beginner, but Ritchie has worked in commercials} then Tarantino has done in all of his films{Don't get me long, I worship Tarantino}. That being said, just because it has this flashy fast paced way about it does not make it hard to understand. Yes, there are over 22 important character in this film, but I hadn't for a second got any of them confused. I know  who belonged where, and what there purpose was.

regular crime thriller,"The film did not impress, but it did not disappoint either.First I'll move on to the pros.The film has sparkling dialogues, and the humor is sharp as diarrhea. I used to laugh myself to death. A twisted plot with a bunch of minor characters, at first it seems that they are not needed, but as in the best traditions of Guy Ritchie, when the credits begin, all the puzzles fall into place and a cool picture turns out. The soundtrack fits very well, and it makes the film even more atmospheric and colorful. The tape is quite interesting shot using: slow motion, hip-hop editing and other elements inherent in commercials.Now to the negative part.I sincerely do not understand the people who put this picture 10 out of 10. In my opinion (subjective opinion), the film should have some other subtext or raising the topic, this movie does not suggest thoughts, but only entertains. Yes, it's funny, yes the tape tightens from the first scene, but where is the conclusion that a good film needs so much.Summary: Cards, money and two smoking barrels. This is a good movie for the evening, no more. Therefore, why on Kinopoisk he has a score of 8.5, I do not understand at all. I'm unlikely to review it a second time, this tape is from the category I looked at once and forgot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Dry action-comedy with almost incomprehensible dialogue,"I can understand why this movie was a hit in Britain.  They can actually make out the words that come out of these ultra-cockney-accented Brits' mouths.  As for us Americans, we're screwed.  Why this movie didn't come with subtitles is beyond my comprehension.Despite that, this movie still became a hit worldwide.  However, I wasn't stimulated by its unique but often dry sense of style.  One thing I do have to note is the soundtrack, which is great, containing some head-bobbing hits by soul artists like James Brown.To add to the incomprehensible dialogue, we're faced with an uninteresting and convoluted plot, full of twists and turns are supposedly worthy of an ""Ahhh"" out of us.  This is one of those movies that piles up so many plots and subplots to the point where I don't even care which direction the characters are headed.  I just can't wait for the movie to end!I think one reason why this movie has such a dull atmosphere is because it's driven by sit-down scenes.  Now, I read in a screenwriting book that ""sit-down"" scenes are like a kiss of death in writing a movie, and unless it's pulled off with pure genius like in ""My Dinner with Andre"" it will make the audience fall asleep in no time.  We have all these scenes where people are sitting in darkly lit pubs, when you know there's supposed some ACTION going on!  This is one of the few dialogue-driven action flicks I've seen. Of course, ""Pulp Fiction"" had a lot of dialogue scenes, but you know what the difference is?  ""PF's"" dialogue was interesting and funny!  This movie has certain echoes of ""Pulp Fiction"" but lacks the sly humor and intelligence.I only laughed a couple of times--if this was, in fact, supposed to be a comedy.  And I watched it TWICE.  So for all of you out there who think I just need to give the movie another look--been there, done that.  ""Lock Stock"" is just not up to my taste.  I don't understand why it made the Top 250, but that's just me.Message to Guy Ritchie:  Next time you make a movie like this...USE SOME FREAKIN' SUBTITLES!!!!My score:  3 (out of 10)",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Try-hard film,"I saw this film at a special late night premire screening and hated the beginning!!  I was hoping for 'Saving Private Ryan' but I got this!

Very entertaining.,"This is not your ordinary crime thriller.  Guy Ritchie takes a venerable genre and gives it an injection of insanity.  Time slows down, speeds up, guns pop out of the woodwork and everyone steals from everyone else.  The plot is simple:  Four guys have one week to come up with a large sum of cash or they start losing fingers.  Along the way, we are introduced to a very colorful cast of characters that will all eventually cross paths in some form or another.  The film is written well, acted well and shot in a style that will not bore you at all. If you're looking for a movie that will keep you hooked, watch this one.  Guy Ritchie is definitely a director that we'll be seeing a lot from.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

top gangster,"You know, dear cinephiles, when judging Richie's crime comedy ""Locks, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" I feel a little foolish, as if I have just been asked to prove why two plus two is still four, and not five, or even not the logarithm of four to base two.Why am I all? Moreover, the words ""Kartishki..."" Richie and ""masterpiece"" are inextricably linked with each other, just as twin brothers are inseparable in life. After all, it is unlikely that in the near future we will see something cooler, more powerful, funnier, more unusual, more explosive than this film.If you suddenly thought that ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a skit parody in the spirit of some Ocean's Eleven robbery, then I hasten to dissuade you from this. Most likely, this is quite an independent and extremely extraordinary work of art by an independent Englishman Richie, who perfectly mastered three things: the first is how to create a whole story about the criminal adventures of four friends, the second is how to fashionably shoot and clearly build this entire attraction, and the last is how to make so that this story captures the attention of the viewer without a trace.What I want to say first of all is that this film surprises all the time. From Ed's first words about three card poker to the very end credits, you'll never get bored. And you certainly won't be watching Richie's work just for sports or a desire to watch the final to find out how this whole cart about four unfortunate friends, dirty as the streets of London, Harry, his jocking assistant, constantly stoned nerds and more will end. A whole dozen evil guys with guns in their hands.I want to note that the characters in the film are not just a lot, but there are very, very many of them. In addition to the main characters in the ""Maps"" regularly appear a whole cloud of minor characters. And at first glance, it seems that they have nothing to do with each other in terms of plot, but, as soon as they appear in the frame, they do the right thing to reveal the plot and die at the suggestion of screenwriter Richie. Such unexpected plot twists and completely atypical storytelling occur in the second most intense half of the film.As a result, the film flies by just with a bang, and in this short time you just don't have time to notice that this crime comedy has at least some flaws. And they really are, but who cares when there is SUCH presentation, SUCH dialogues and SUCH soundtrack?!The presentation is uncompromising and stylish. The whole action is filmed in a fashionable clip style - a sharp cut and a constant change of shots. And the action itself is savvy with brutal showdowns, and throughout the film we will witness scenes when ridiculous shootouts are intertwined with ""humane"" ways of returning debts in a single gloomy London. Moreover, all this is commented on with strong cursing words.But despite this, you will laugh non-stop. There are much more jokes and chic dialogues here than shootings, so retelling local jokes that people have long pulled into quotes is akin to a crime. This, of course, needs to be watched, because a sense of humor, it seems to me, never changes Guy at all.The soundtrack is a whole gift for moviegoers from the generous Richie. And for such generosity, he can be forgiven for all this idiocy and mass farce. It fits almost perfectly into the atmosphere of this movie, and even more - it is pleasant to listen to it equally separately: in the car, and in the subway, and at work, and at a desk at a boring lecture, and even at home - in short, everywhere. Everything is so mixed in it that it will not be so easy to count all the genres and directions. And this is exactly what we really lack for complete happiness.Thus, to write about ""Locks, Money and Two Smoking Barrels"" in the conventional manner, in my opinion, is quite stupid, because this movie is above a ten-point rating, this is a masterpiece that appeared literally from nowhere, and immediately produced the effect of an exploding bomb. In turn, at that time, an unknown director and screenwriter Guy Ritchie, who managed to make his own little revolution in world cinema, fell under the sights of moviegoers.Summary: the film ""Lock, Stock, Two Smoking Barrels"" became the most innovative and interesting, the reference point and the word in its genre. But, if you still want to get the most objective assessment of it, then here it is: ""A masterpiece or the best picture of the cult director Guy Ritchie."" As a matter of fact, I could start with this and end with the same.10 of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Rocking and rolling little timewaster,"A young card sharp loses heavily in a crooked game and has to find a way of paying his debts or else....Forget the plot, this is just an excuse to bring together a lot of British character actors (no future stars - but all ok) and crib bits and pieces of other peoples movies. Quentin Tarantino's early efforts being the most prominent. However it is done with far too much pace, sharp/cruel humour and rock music bombast for the MTV bred audience not to lap it up.This is, amazingly, Guy Richies first film and credit to him for trying something with ambition. Also great to see what you can get done on a small budget and a couple of cheap back street sets (colour filters help disguise what they are!) He couldn't even afford the video playback system that most film makers use nowadays.He later went on to write and direct Snatch, which is basically the same product,but in much improved and expanded form. Nevertheless a very entertaining time waster and a real solid start for a director whose talents and depths are, as yet, unknown.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Was it Jimmy Breslin who wrote the book, The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight?  In this case change it to Gangs.","Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels was written and directed brilliantly by Guy Ritchie.  This shoot 'em farce about inept criminals was well crafted with interesting characters too numerous to mention.  There is no ""lead"" character and arguably a dozen or so main characters. The dialogue was great, if at times a little hard to follow, with the lyrical Eastender cockney slang. The movie involves several groups of criminals and more plot twists than you can imagine.  I really wish I could've seen this movie twice.  There are many gems to be mined in this film and I know I didn't find them all.  I will rent, and if possible buy, this video.

The Best of British Humour!!,What a fantastic film!!Every now and again a film emerges that just knocks everyone who sees it for six and this is definitely one of them!!With a great cast; mixing relative unknowns with some familiar faces (one of whom is for all the wrong reasons - until now that is!!) the film draws you in from the start.

Basic Outline of the film and my opinion,"Guy Ritchie's ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is one of the most well crafted crime/comedy/action films I have ever seen. The use of the narrator enables all characters within the film to be properly introduced. This includes the main four characters, Tom (Jason Flemyng), Bacon (Jason Statham), Soap (Dexter Fletcher) and Eddie (Nick Moran) to the supporting characters such as Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) and Barry the Baptist (Lenny ""The Guv'nor"" McLean). What makes Lock, Stock such a great film is the way Ritchie weaves his characters and the plot so that they all cross paths in the end. Eddie enters a card game against Hatchet Harry on behalf of himself, Tom, Bacon and Soap and ends up owing half a million pounds. While at the same time Dog, with Plank and crew rob the weed growers Winston, Willy and Charles. As it happens Dog and his crew live next to Eddie and Bacon. Eddie overhears them and decides to rob them in order to pay off his debt to Harry. Also included are Harry's debt collector Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) and Harry's bodyguard Barry the Baptist , Criminal head honcho Rory Breaker (Vas Blackwood), stolen goods dealer Nick the Greek and Eddie's Dad Jd (Sting). Through sheer luck and at times utter stupidity, all those included get their paths well and truly crossed which makes for an excellent final scene.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

An absolutely brilliant piece!,"If there ever was a brilliant film worth 11 points on a 10 point scale, Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels surely was one. If you like that sort of stuff of course.

You can't help but wonder how you yourself would act in a situation like this - although surely, no viewer could be as stupid as the characters in the film. Well, stupid is probably a bit strong. Naive perhaps. In any case, the story is brilliantly told, you keep rooting for the good guys, and for ... ahem... some less good ones as well.

"An entertaining, amusing and forgettable film","An enjoyable, entertaining and highly stylised romp through London gang violence by Guy Ritchie. The film is brilliantly edited, however the use of third person narration and sequential edits is derivative of 'Trainspotting' (which is a much better film). The lighting is effectively sparse and effectively conveys the drabness and tawdriness of the characters and subject matter.After watching this film I do not feel particularly bothered about ever seeing it again. It is certainly an overrated film and comes nowhere near classic British crime films like 'Get Carter' and 'The Long Good Friday'. The high ratings given to this film is because of it's current trendiness rather than it's overall cinematic quality. In Britain, the TV spin-off, not directed by Ritchie, 'Lock Stock..' was absolutely atrocious and was quite rightly panned by critics. Some of the other user comments saying that this film is better than American crime movies is palpable rubbish, this cannot compete with 'Goodfellas', 'The Godfather', 'The Sopranos', 'Reservoir Dogs' etc.In conclusion, this is a good little film but not a great one and time will be the judge of that.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

The utter nonsense it seemed while this was on my TV screen, it couldn't even be treated as a background noise while I cooked in the kitchen, because it was pure noise.

Sharp crime-caper that's a capsule on the cyclical nature of crime never paying.,"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels shows what British cinema is capable of when you focus on desperate people living in Britain's criminal underbelly terrified of owing their nasty bosses overdue, and unrealistically large, payments. The film's sharp, fast-paced editing and sepia-tone highlights this film being an energising story told from cynical and conspiring criminals unsure of what tomorrow holds for them.Guy Ritchie does a damn fine job playing with the inherently destructive ways of criminal livelihoods, and that it's fun for observers but never for the 'actors' who actually get caught up in needlessly difficult trouble. We're watching and laughing; the characters would cuss at us for daring to do that because of their suffering. And this film works as an Uber-Dark-comedy because of this self-awareness: the way it's playful with the nastiness instead of being overly soppy for it.This is a very entertaining caper film through and through.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

The first time I watched it, I was a little confused, and it took me about half way through the movie to finally interpret their accent's, but after that it was a splendid film. The second time I watched it, I was just in pure awe.  The accent came a lot better to understand, along with the story detail.  To use a 90's cliche, this movie was done similar the the ""Quentin Tarantino"" effect, with the backwards way of unraveling some of the story, which added to the suspense. The story starts off unraveling the backgrounds of the 4 main charecters, and the sub-charecters of the movie.  Then we begin to learn the amazing plot:  A young brazen Poker player is going to be playing for big money on a table with more big money.  The gig is, he is ""borrowing"" money from his friends as an investment for them, potentially gaining 2 times what they put in.

Putting the cock in shotgun.,"The editing for this movie is astounding in my opinion.  The appropriate use of slow-motion and music in this film give it a quality that could only be described as a ""Guy Ritchie film.""  The main feature of this film that I noticed at first however, is the noticeable lack of presence of women.  The domination of masculinity presents very interesting possibilities for meaning in the film, with the character Hatchet Harry being the epitomal representation for masculinity: A powerful man who sits atop his sex shop in his second-story office.  Yet I believe that while the film begins to glorify masculinity, the ending denounces it.  However if you're not one for reading into film, I believe this movie carries with it an amazing story with unpredictable plot twists.

"jusco's review: Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels","It's like Snatch's twin brother, which I guess is understandable considering it's the same director. Guy Ritchie's first film is in typical fashion; bizarre, erratic, whimsical. Once again following several interlinking story arcs, it is a puzzling crime film with a lot of laughs and deaths. Four young men find themselves in debt to a crime lord (£500,000!) and they conspire to steal money from their weed-growing next door neighbours. On top of that, two antique guns and a whole bunch of characters find themselves unknowingly involved and pitted against each other; a perfect setup for a comedic and violent tragedy. Containing smart dialogue and sharp, stylish camera work (different from Snatch's editing, but still unconventional) and relatively solid performances all round, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a solid debut from the British director. Unfortunately, if you end up watching both Snatch and this, you'll be sick of the similar styles and tones. However, it is still hilarious and of course, shocking, and it's well worth a watch. Though Snatch may have had more laugh-out-loud moments, I personally enjoyed the crafting of this film better; the editing was not as distracting, thus allowing smoother flow, and I also found the ending brilliant.

This Guy Ritchie classic is experimental in many ways. The way it tells the story, the cuts, the camera angles and the script, it all feels fresh for a 1998 film. In many ways this film has changed the way films got made thereafter. I believe an entire generation is indebted to Guy Ritchie for changing storytelling, camera angles and scripts in cinema forever. The story of a few small time crooks and some gangsters and how their actions cross each others paths. This could be made into a serious drama. But throw in a brilliant script, loads of humour, some impeccable coming timing and an outstanding yet brave direction and what you get is a laugh riot, you wish, never ends.

One of the best low(ish) budget films of all time,"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a trend-setting and doesn't get its proper due. Many people point to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction as the most revolutionary films of the modern era but some might argue that Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels deserves just as much credit as these two. Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie brought everyone into the modern day of what movies could be and what many now are. Guy Ritchie, unfortunately for him, didn't write as many quotable one liners as Tarantino, not to mention the heavy cockney accents found in this film as well as Snatch. In the eyes of the general public, these reasons are why Ritchie is back a couple of notches from the fame of Tarantino.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels has what can only be described as a Guy Ritchie stamp on it. It was shot on Super 16 which gives the film a beautiful look and feel throughout. At certain times the film does feel a bit low budget but not as often as one might expect. There are points in this movie where you are in awe of how gorgeous the images are and how well crafted the framing is. There are some innovative ways Ritchie uses true slow motion in this film as well. It is important to point out that he did not shoot the slow motion parts in real time and then slow them down after. These were shot in true slow motion. You can tell the difference and it's one of the many things I love about this movie. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels had a budget of 1.3 million which does sound like a lot of money but when you look at what Ritchie ultimately ended up producing with that budget it is quite incredible. It is even more incredible when you review the cast and see just how many great actors are in this movie. All of them, from Jason Statham down did a fantastic job. There was only one or two moments where the acting wasn't the best but for the most part this movie felt like an extremely large production because of the quality of acting, the size of the cast and the many shootouts that occurred.There is one particular shootout in this film that was outrageously gorgeous. This one scene involves a stoned out female, an enormous automatic weapon and a dose of comedy at the end. ""Where the f*** did she come from?"" Priceless. The slow motion in that scene is incredible and has you in awe as the spent rounds hit the floor while the hailstorm ensues. It is one of the best shootout scenes captured in any film. Unfortunately, this style of shooting has been stolen and overdone by many directors as the years have gone by. This has caused this type of filming to go stale and now hardly anyone does it anymore, unfortunately.The other great thing about this film that is incredible is that Vinnie Jones who plays Big Chris just got out of jail on the first day of shooting this film. He was arrested for attacking a neighbor. To be able to keep Vinnie focused and have him deliver a great performance like he did shows just how good Ritchie is. It is also a great casting job as Vinnie is one of the few people that could pull that role off. He is also well known as a very tough soccer player which I am sure made the casting job a little easier as they might have wanted someone who is relatively well known for that part.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels isn't without flaws. There are a few moments where you can tell Ritchie is trying to save on cost and in turn it produces a moment that is just a little bit strange or doesn't quite work. There are also a couple of scenes where the writing could be a bit stronger or some of the plot holes could have been filled better but for the most part it is a great film that can stand up to just about anything out there. Without Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels we would not have the clever movie Snatch which could be considered a high budget version of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels many actors return to that film and the writing style is almost exactly the same. That shouldn't come as too big of a shock considering that Ritchie did write both but it is worth noting that Snatch is another film that takes this style of directing and expands on it as Ritchie was given much more to work with. Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels should be homework for any film student.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

A richie classic,"Lock, stock and two smoking barrels is an instant ricie classic. Unlike other films it does not use constant swearing as this was his first, but also in my opinion one of the best of his movies. This movie is about four men. Tom, soap eddy and bacon. After a poker game that eddy loses they are in the hole of 500,000 and so go to steal some guns. That other people want to. The team is made up of jason flemyng, dexter fletcher, nick moran and the legend himself jason statham. A great group that provide some good comic relife and serious tones.

"Lock, Lavender and Big Deal on Madonna Street","Forty years after Mario Monicelli's Big Deal on Madonna Street (1958), Guy Ritchie surprised the world with his freshman feature length effort Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998). Both feature a cast of relative unknowns making eager but unsuccessful attempts at petty crime. But while Big Deal grounds its farcical elements with post-war Italian neo-realism, Lock, Stock is played largely for laughs and told with an infectious sense of film-school-reject style.The principle foursome in Lock, Stock have a foolproof plan to make a handsome profit. Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Jason Statham each pass on scrounged savings to their ringer Eddy (Nick Moran). Eddy then takes part in an illegal poker game featuring some of East London's most notorious gangsters. = Profits. What they don't count on however is the host of the card game Hatchet Harry (P.H. Moriarty) cheating and putting the boys in over their heads. Now it's either come up with £100,000 or end up taking a swim in the Thames.There are side stories involving drugs, stolen antiques and a psychopath with a ""cute cuddly thing"" going on, all of which converge in flashes of confusion and absolute chaos. It was like watching an extended version of the last twenty minutes of The Lavender Hill Mob (1951) inter-spliced with Tom and Jerry shorts resulting in an ending that would make the cast of Seinfeld (1989-1998) proud. The rich irony of the situations created by Guy Ritchie (who also wrote the script) and the galvanizing moments of fate never lose their luster even after repeated viewings.While Ritchie was born in Hatfield, Hertfordshire he no doubt wrote what he knew when he ascribed the bungling protagonists and their equally shortsighted foils. They are characters that you might bump into on the mean streets of East End complete with Cockney accents and colorful idioms. In the DVD extra bonus features there is even a Cockney to English dictionary that translates certain phrases like North=Mouth and Geezer=slightly older fellow. But lest you be too busy for the bonus features, at one point in the film subtitles appear for bit to help non-Cockneys understand the comedy. In the words of Professor Henry Higgins in My Fair Lady (1964) ""There even are places where English completely disappears; in America they haven't used it for years."" Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels makes for perfect rental fodder. It's breezy, funny, full of character and style while never slumping into moments of boredom. To Jason Statham fans, this movie is a must since not only did he explode onto the scene with this film, he shows he can actually act. To Guy Ritchie fans who no doubt have already seen Lock, Stock and prefer the more popular Snatch. (2000) I still would recommend giving this one another shot even if its sans a Brad Pitt. You never know what little details (or idioms) you might pick up.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
great,"Great acting, great comedy. This reminds me a bit of a tarantino film which i really like. I love films that are shot on film and have a grainy look, but this one was a little to grainy for me and had just to much of a yellow high contrast tint. Also a problem i did have with this film was that there were so many people with there own little story, that you would sometimes forget who was who, and what they were actually doing. Although all the stories did come together in the end, so that would clear it up a bit. I love how you are most on the edge of your seat at the end of the film, because its a comedic scene and not an action scene.8/10Would watch again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
It's been emotional...,"I'm confused to see that a lot of people seem to be comparing this film with Pulp fiction. Although I like Pulp Fiction immensely, I FAIL to see to comparison between the two films. Besides, WHY do you have to compare it to anything? Why does it have to be the ""British Pulp Fiction""? That's just stupid!!Lock, Stock is my favorite film of all time - and that, for a film buff like me, if a HUGE call. It has everything in it; comedy, wit, action, style, a great soundtrack, wonderful acting (the sexy Nick Moran being my favorite), perfect direction and cinematography and an even more perfect script.Now, the two things about this film that make it as perfect as it is, is the witty and intelligent script and the wonderful characters. Through the script and the great acting, the characters, although many, are able to really be developed, and developed well. We get to know not only the main four; Ed, Bacon, Soap and other characters like Winston, Plank, Rory and Harry so quickly. We really get a sense of who they and what their intentions are from just a short period of time with them.There are so many wonderful and clever lines in the script and they are quick and easy to miss sometimes. I would recommend watching this film at least twice (Or like me, over one hundred times) in order to gain full understanding of the dialogue.Now, it's only natural progression that after praising the film I'm to move onto talking about the writer/director, Guy Richie. To be honest I don't care about his string of not-so-good films after Snatch, which I must say, I didn't like as much as Lock Stock. To me this film stands alone as the film he became to writer/director for. I also don't care about his affiliation with Maddonna, that's his personal business and nothing to do with me. None of that stuff matters to me because this film is perfect as far as I'm concerned.I have seen and enjoyed this movie many many times over.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Though i loved the way the Guy Ritchie, put all the intro and the characters into perspective, what really impressed me was an equally amazing conclusion and summing up of the movie.. The direction and the execution of the movie was superb and like most of the movies with a great script loose track in the middle of the movie, this kept the pace and fun going through out.. What really impressed me was the right mix of each element at the right time, some of the most agonising and painful scenes do still make you laugh, owing to the right mix.

WAY WAY TOO OVERRATED!!!,"After all the praise it had been given, I expected ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" to be at the very least, entertaining. I'm not too pleased to say that it failed miserably at achieving even that.First off, the film is so overstyled I'm surprised that the cinematographer put his name on the credits. The acting is atrocious, particularly by Nick Moran and Val Blackwood. (Blackwood's over-acting is the only thing that made me laugh.) Vinnie Jones is decently cast, but is given the idiotic role of a hitman who carries around his 12 year old son to ""teach him the ropes.""The script is a mixture of robbery cliches, and Guy Ritchie displays minimal talent as a writer/director. Jason Flemying has the only watchable performance in the film as Tom. The soundtrack is good, but here's a tip Guy, a good soundtrack doesn't make a good movie.  The film tries to overload itself with attitude but falls horribly flat. Was this supposed to be a comedy or a comedy of cinematic errors?",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
An absolute masterpiece,"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is hands down one of the most entertaining and cleverly written films I've ever watched. Guy Ritchie's direction in this film is nothing short of brilliant, making it a true classic of crime comedy. From start to finish, I found myself laughing out loud at the witty dialogue, while at the same time being hooked by the intense action scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat.The dialogue is so fast-paced and sharp that you feel like you need to rewatch certain scenes just to catch every line. Each character is memorable and feels authentic, bringing their own unique sense of humor to the table. Jason Statham's performance, in particular, was fantastic-this is the film where I first really noticed him.The pacing of the film is spot on, with something always happening-there's never a dull moment! And the soundtrack? Absolutely perfect. Each track enhances the scene and adds to the overall energy. It's a heist story at heart, but the chaos and humor thrown into the mix take it to a whole new level.If you love crime films with a dark sense of humor, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is an absolute must-watch. It will make you laugh, surprise you, and stay with you long after it's over. I loved every minute of it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A Masterpiece,"It's difficult to list films that have had the same effect on their genre that Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels has. I defy any reader to name me a British gangster film made in the last ten years that does not have some resemblance to director Guy Richie's 1998 Magnum Opus.But what is it, you may ask, that makes Lock Stock so excellent, so worthy of emulations? Well, let's start with the dialogue. Richie's script cracks with wit, humour and a strong sense of authenticity. The characters are well acted and larger than life, with household names of British cinema such as Jason Statham, Jason Flemyng and Frank Harper making their characters unique.Plot also contributes greatly to the film's excellence. It revolves around professional gambler Ed (Nick Moran) and his friends, who seek an easy earner in an illegal poker game. Unfortunately, thanks to a spot of unfair play it goes awry, with the four owing money to local gangster, 'Hatchet' Harry Lonsdale. With a week to pay off the debt, the four stumble on a plan involving a large quantity of ganja, Ed's psychotic neighbours, privately educated drug dealers and a football mad psychopath with an afro...Lock Stock also features a powerful, gritty soundtrack, with songs from Robbie Williams, James Brown and a host of other talents.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels by Guy Ritchie","I was finally introduced to this film in March of this year by a friend, alongside it's successor film, Snatch. Since then I've viewed the film a total of three times, and I've finally come to point of being able to a compile a critical review. I've taken time to handle it properly, as this is understandably a cult classic and has warranted a lot of good reviews.I believe that Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a charming movie that achieves a lot despite it's low budget. It contains standout performances and creative cinematography at times, but holds it's failings in both of those departments as well. The movies' strongest attributes are it's tone, plot and pacing, and doesn't actually contain too many issues aside from sound design and one or two plot holes. Overall, I think Lock, Stock is one of the best British comedies I've seen in a while.There are numerous other little issues I also took up with the film, but a great deal of them owed largely to the films low budget. On that note, a lot of the effects and visuals that would disappoint on a higher budget actually work impressively considering the films constraints on money. Considering the debatable aspects surrounding criticizing budgeted effects, I'll opt to leave those criticisms out of my review.Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels was produced in 1998 but largely defies time period in it's cinematography and design. It's rustic color palette and noticeable film grain place it more often in the era of the 1970s. But Cinematography in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels in general is a hit and miss. The film contains some amazing sequences, especially during action scenes and the infamous card game which sets off the entire plot. This is excellent, as the parts of the movie that seriously matter are almost all given a good level of film quality, but the same cannot be said for the scenes in between. Conversations between characters, especially those with shots that go back and forth are at best unoriginal and at worst so awkward that they can detract from the largely superb writing. And with dialogue being a supreme feature in this film (might I mention since it is especially lacking in visual storytelling), not having the cinematographic quality to go hand it hand with the quips often leaves me wanting.Speaking of dialogue, the films plot and script are the greatest aspect it has to offer. At no point in the film does the consistent back and forth between the ensemble cast end or lose it's magic. It's no surprise that the film is ranked as one of the most quotable films to come out of Britain's comedy market. The plot, for the most part, is an easy to understand but still complex web of connecting lines bringing the entire set of characters together through a special and sometimes dubious set of circumstances. It's a rather fun joy ride to sit through and track even through multiple viewings, and even by my third viewing, there were small details in both dialogue and occasionally visual cues that I missed out on. The film also doesn't hold the viewers hand too much, despite an admittedly helpful narration, and plot points that can confound first time viewers are always smoothly resolved by the end of the film. The characters themselves are unique and often relatable, despite being brought down by amateur acting skills at times. They're written with a decent degree of complexity and some little details I only noticed, once again, in re-watches.But on the note of characters and their actors, the acting in this film is much like cinematography as it quite often hits and misses, but on a much more prevalent scale than the former. While the film no doubt contains some all star performances, it is quite often brought down by stale delivery by unemotional actors as well. Jason Statham, Vinnie Jones and Steve Mackintosh all add to the film with great performances, and give the movie a good backbone despite the lacking work from actors with more screen time like Nick Moran and Lenny McLean. Overall the bad performances in the film are largely put in the shade by the aforementioned writing skills of Guy Ritchie. I'm not an expert of music so I haven't take the time to check out the movies soundtrack but nonetheless it is certainly well put together. I found that they were very suitable for the movies subject matter and blended well with the overall finished product. This, however, was brought down by the small issue of sound design in weapons and environments.Some of the other things I enjoyed before concluding: The pace is great, lighting is great and visual effects are notably decent for what they were. One more thing I didn't enjoy is the occasional plot points scattered about, but none are serious enough to hurt my rating.In summary, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is an entertaining crime comedy that accomplishes quite a lot despite it's budget. While it is damaged by acting, cinematography, sound design and plot holes, none of these things are significant enough to damage the overall experience too much. Through multiple watches I found that there was things that I only noticed later on, along with the fact that the comedy still holds strong no matter how many times you ingest the quips. Watch out for my review of Snatch, coming soon. I'm happy leaving the movie with an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"Visually and cinematically, ""Trainspotting"" meets Tarantino -- story-wise, an unfortunate case of style over substance","""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" (1998) has become something of a cult classic (particularly in the UK) and has a devout fan following. In the wake of the Quentin Tarantino self-knowing genre imitators this is one of the few to stand apart from the rest and make a name for itself.Unfortunately that's all it really is -- a Tarantino imitator. It's entirely coincidental that it's had any more of an impact than, say, ""The Way of the Gun,"" or other failed Tarantino spawns.There have been some people on the IMDb message boards saying, ""...Tarantino just rips people off so how can this be a rip off of Tarantino?"" Tarantino does indeed rip off, or ""borrow,"" other filmmakers. But his visual style is a distinct one -- his raw, edgy, down-to-earth directorial style with the dark shades and grungy grain -- and ""Lock Stock"" copies this way too often.Guy Ritchie got his start in TV commercials and that's very clear. I suppose most Americans wouldn't be able to tell since the commercials in America are so stupid and banal. In the UK, commercials (particularly those such as the Stella Artois ads) tell stories and have a clear visual edge that is lacking in the US. Ritchie's style is identical to the sensuous and dark adverts being broadcast in the UK. The camera angles, styles and hand-cam shots are all straight from TV; the gambling sequence where a character's head is blurred and spun around, or when the camera bursts out of a cook's boiling pot of water, are straight from the tube; Ritchie's background is instantly recognizable. In my opinion, it's not a good style for film; it's like a mix between Soderbergh and Tarantino, and I don't like it much. (Although admittedly it's great for adverts.) This picture is alive, sure, because of the TV-style flair. But that doesn't mean it's any good. To be totally honest I found it to be a huge bore and a wannabe Tarantino flick crossed with Irvine Welsh.I couldn't care less about any of the characters. I liked Jason Statham the most, but the others are introduced so poorly, and examined so recklessly, that I quickly lost track of their traits and felt as if I was -- yet again -- watching some extended TV commercial: style over substance.The dialogue is OK, I guess, and in fact the actors all bring it alive because they do very much sound like Eastern Londoners. (Can't say how many people I've met who talk just like this!) That would be the highest praise I can give it.""Trainspotting"" is the best UK film of the 1990s, in my opinion, and ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a pale imitation of both this and the Quentin Tarantino generation. Its dialogue, directorial style and hip self-conscious vibe have all been over-used to such an extent that it just comes across as pretentious, showy and artificial -- not fun, just dumb.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Doesn't include the Amp,"While this can't seem to decide whether its a comedy or a thriller perhaps that doesn't matter because its a cracking film with great pace and humour and a bloody convoluted Jacobean plot. I loved the camera tricks which so annoyed others (I particularly liked the sceen introducing Soap with a saucepan shot from below) and the grainy stock.With no great stars (save perhaps Vinie Jones who for our oversea readers was a very big football [i.e. soccer] star before taking up acting) the cast is spot on. I believe that there is only one female speaking role (the croupier) and only two female roles all told, which must be a record of some sort these days.Brits and Aussies (the Oz accent being an extension of cockney) won't have problems with the accents but for goodness sake Americans, more English speakers live outside the US than in it and we've struggled for years with heavy New York or Southern US accents without complaint. I've never understood what Blanche in the Golden Girls was on about for instance and the Dukes of Hazzard only became intelligible when we got teletext sub-titles about 20 years ago.Yes, the are superfical likeness to a number of films and the ending is a bit of a rip off from the Italian Job, but hey, this hung together very well even so.

Ritchie's best,"Guy Ritchie's feature length debut might just be his finest directorial effort of them all. Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is about a group of four friends who pool their money together to play in a high stakes poker game. However, things don't go according to plan and they end up owing 500,000 pounds to the owner of a porn shop in downtown London. The worst part... they only have a week to get him the money or they'll have their digits cut off one by one until their fingerless, toeless, and maybe noseless. And so the group of clowns come up with a hair brained scheme to come up with this hefty sum of cash, and what they come up with is twisty, wacky, and violently hilarious.At the beginning of the movie we meet our four protagonists, as well as a cavalcade of other characters who all seem to be totally unrelated. But as the story progresses everyone we meet at the beginning of the film serves a purpose and the way the characters intertwine and the way their stories develop through a series of mix-ups, misunderstandings, and wrong place at the wrong time scenarios is absolutely brilliant. Rarely do you see such refined work in big heist storytelling that manages to be intriguing and enthralling, but also possess a dash of something else. A streak of black humor that makes you cringe and laugh at the same time and a thick layer of wicked action and brutal violence. It's incredibly exciting, and wildly entertaining.One of the strongest elements of Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is the script, which is riddled with slang, one liners, and character nuances that make every scenario and every person in the film unique. There's a very specific cadence to the way the characters talk in the film with their thick cockney accents and their love of word play, similes, and all other sorts of figurative language. There's a real clever ingenuity behind all the laughs and all the bloodshed, and it makes this film something like we don't usually see. It's an action comedy that doesn't use cheap gags or easy laughs, but it's also a grandiose heist story that doesn't make things too overly complicated, but brings in enough elements to the story to make your head spin. But it's the good kind of spinning. The one that enthralls you into the story and the one that makes you love every minute of this incredibly excellent film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Excellent!!!,"Lock, stock, and two smoking barrels is an amazing film. Geniusely crafted by a genius, Guy Ritchie. His more recent films such as Sherlock Holmes one and two, have disappointed me. But, his earlier work such as this and snatch, still amazes me with laughter and pure awesomeness every time I see it now and day. This is an excellent film that should be regarded as a great. It just shows you how well a low budget Independent film can be and how you can really make a film on your own and make it a masterpiece. I'm 13 years old and my dream is to grow up and make independent films that have reminisce of people like Guy Ritchie, Quentin Tarantino, Richard Linklater, Kevin Smith, Robert Rodriguez, exc. So, if you watch this film, make sure to have a big bowl of popcorn and a sense of humour. If you have these two things, you are sure to be amazed!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"Ignore the pretenders, only Guy Ritchie can make 'em like this (and even he forgot how).","Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels sparked a short lived spate of samish wannabes of vast ensemble casts spouting salty dialogue in unique circumstances, much of it from director Guy Ritchie himself.But you can't go past Lock, Stock as the originator and best example of the genre. More than a decade on it remains fresh, smart and entertaining, launching the B careers of both Vinnie Jones and Jason Statham.Ritchie proves that he has an ear for dialogue and a well chosen musical interlude, and the ability to fashion a labyrinthine multi-layered plot populated by colourful characters all entrenched in the small time underworld. The core plot follows 4 long time friends, Tom, Soap, Eddie and Bacon, all toeing the fine line between a (mostly) legal existence and petty crime. These four are hardly hardened, hardmen at the start of the film. But things change when circumstances demand.To be more specific, when a high stakes poker game with renowned underworld figure Hatchet harry goes awry and Tom and buds find Harry on his tail and his Dad's (Sting) bar on the line, with seven days to make good on a half million pound debt and no obvious legal way to fund it.A myriad of colourful characters quickly and often unwittingly become embroiled in an ever-escalating, increasingly intricate, always irreverent series of events. Drug dealers, hired goons, thieves and more than enough hard guys than would usually be required to change a lightbulb all descend upon the four in ways that are circuitous, coincidental and convenient.The body count grows steadily, though for a long while most of the violence occurs offscreen, but as the stakes are raised and the number of participants grows it is inevitable that so many guys waving guns about will eventually bring casualties, many of which fall in quick succession.Despite this Lock, Stock is hardly a 'video nasty' akin to Hostel and the Saw films, but a wildly entertaining and creative Cops n Robbers tale sans the Cops that shows good plotting and well crafted dialogue can elevate a film above the pack.Final Rating – 8 / 10. Spawned many imitators who missed the point, you can't be fresh and original by making the same stuff as someone else. Only Guy Ritchie can make 'em like this, and even he forgot how",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Brutally hard British crime,"Four middle aged men attempt to recover a massive debt by stealing money and drugs with only a week to repay the biggest gangster in the business.The first film for writer/director Guy Ritchie was, when released, a refreshing slap in the face of hardcore British crime that had been somewhat lost and with a relatively unknown cast this proved indie works and what a wake up call this was to the dimension of British cinema and film making.After Danny Boyle's refreshingly controversial Trainspotting a few years previously this launched British cinema further onto the world stage through its heavy political gangster world and heavy use of drug and violence.Since Quentin Tarantino arrived in the early 1990's violence and drugs in cinema have been dealt with in a freer environment. Who could forget Mia Wallace's coke taking sequence? And the Brits have followed that through with an equally effective use.Opening with a good fast narration of no nonsense attitude, this is how it is, we have the unseen protagonist showing us who the movers and shakers are and what the game is all about. This quick fire introduction scene setting is great as we can steadily move forward without looking back and whilst there is an overhaul in characters to begin we can settle and watch the adventure unfold.After a cleverly shot card game the main characters find themselves in desperation to recover £500,000 within a week which spells delicious entertainment for all watching as stealing, robbery and gambling are all encoded for ensuing mayhem and just like Snatch and layer Cake this whole situation is exceptionally serious, but has a great balance of being inappropriately humorous. The feet through the table, the attempted unrehearsed robbery even the character one liners will have us chuckling away and this being the catalyst for the future is a great reminder to where it all started. Don't expect any James Bond styling here this is all gung ho action specked dialogue with a rural frustration that spices with dark comedy that makes it unique and is highly appreciated as Guy Ritchie's most thought provoking and equal best.On a personal level I find Snatch to have the edge owing to the excellent montages and easier to distinguish protagonists, not to mention the whole business of fighting intermixed with other crime concepts fits together perfectly. This 1998 picture has a few holes, just a few. There is an overhaul of characters and it is quite hard on first or second viewing to remember who is who and where. Plus the synchronization of perfect timing can backfire in a few scenes.Apart from that and the unnecessary swearing this is a brutally hard riveting crime drama that flies high with comedy and perfectly started the hard nut crime segment of excellent British gangster films.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

A thoroughly entertaining movie with action and good story lines.,"Being a Brit in the US it was refreshing to hear so many Americans in KC raving about this movie. They did admit that it was hard for them to understand some of the conversations but I think that everyone that I showed the movie to or had seen it because of word of mouth found it to be an very entertaining movie. This was especially surprising with its limited release at the movies.This movie has it all - gore, lots of laughter, action and suspense. This film has so many levels to it that even watching it again and again is a joy. The filming techniques and the music help to round off the multiple story lines.The actors are great and I would not like to meet any of the bad guys in a dark alley. I was not aware of many of them (Sting, Moriarty and Jones withstanding).Although Vinnie Jones played his part well in the movie I did not think that he was the pick of the bunch. P.H.

"PULP FICTION & 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY, English Style.","I heard very little before seeing this movie.  I was just told by my friends that it's the best film to come from England since ""THE FULL MONTY"" and that it's great!  So, I put on my Dr. Martin's boots, put in my collection of English Pop Music from the 80's and early 90's (New Order, OMD, The Farm, Madness, etc.) and got into my English mood.  After seeing this movie, I was pleased, very very pleased!  I think this movie is better and more exciting than the current #1 film at the box office, ""THE MATRIX."" ""LOCK STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS"" has different stories.  They range from losing a huge bet during a poker game, two clumsy thieves stealing two antique shot-guns, a gang of young men figuring out on how to get 500,000 Pounds to a mob boss by Sunday, another gang planing on stealing money from weed dealers, and so on. This has been done many times, PULP FICTION is the most famous version, 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY was the most underrated, and GO is the most recent.  But what makes this film work?  Simple, the characters, the stories, the rich dark humor, and the directing.  You actually care about these characters, you wonder on what's going to happen to them next.  I was amazed to see YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES Nichols Rowe on screen after not seeing him for almost 15 years.  But if anyone stands out with their character or acting, it would be Vinnie Jones playing ""Big Chris"" the hit-man for the Mob Boss Harry ""Hatchet"" Lonsdale. He brings his son who's about ten years old along during his work, ""Big Chris"" even allows his son to watch him beat up on a person, but he won't allow him to swear or to blasphemy. Along with other great U.K. films ""TRAINSPOTTING"" ""THE COMMITMENTS"" ""THE FULL MONTY"" ""WAKING NED DIVINE"" ""MONA LISA"" ""THE KRAYS"" ""THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY"" and all of the Monty Python films.  ""LOCK STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS"" proves that you can always rely on the English for great entertainment.

I really felt bad for the guys' situation and it's funny to see how they resolve it.  All the twists, ups and downs produce dark, but very funny moments.

Best Guy Ritchie film...much better than Snatch,"No matter how many times I see this movie, it never gets old. And it seems that I realize something new with each viewing. It has a very complicated storyline with interconnected sub-stories, but the all come together at the end beautifully. Yeah the movie is violent, but that's the point. And the action is awesome, something that Guy Ritchie does like no one else. But the movie is also funny and ironic. Plus it's got Sting playing a bad@$$ and was the film that launched Jason Staham as a popular actor in America...if only he could pick some better movies (how many Transporters are there now, like 10?) If you haven't seen this movie, find it and BUY it. You'll never get tired of watching it. Even the second or third or fiftieth time you see it you'll still be surprised and pleased. Again, I know everyone loves Snatch, and yeah Brad Pitt is pretty great, just like he is in everything. But this is the same type of film but ties together much better than that one, which seems like two movies crammed into one.

A Class Act.,"I made a few attempts to watch Lock , Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels . Once on T.V. and twice on DVD and with failure always found my-self losing interest (maybe because there was a lot more going on the out-side of my life ) . However last night for some reason or another I sat down and watched it and yes it really was that dame good . The dialogue was classy , the jokes hit the spot and I did find it to be some what addictive viewing . This film goes up there with Pulp Fiction , it does require a close following to but once you get sucked in , trust me you will love every second of it ! The plot is wacky , the ride that follows after that is a barrel of laughs . The main character's are not trying to go OTT on acting like hard men but it flows naturally even their dim-witted behaviour . I would say that my favourite characters would have to be Soap for his witty comments especially when it come to knives , Vinnie Jones who seems to play a very questionable roll model to his son as his line of work is not totally kosher but my absolute favourite has to be the football loving yardie Rory Breaker played with brilliance by Vas Blackwood (His I'll kill ya speech just can't stop making me laugh ) . This one Britian's finest exports , highly entertaining stuff , not to be missed with plenty of reply value , but thats what you would expect from the man who gave you Snatch . I would like to say more but I feel that will be killing the buzz of movie , so just check it out for your-self .LOCK , STOCK AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS : 8.3 OUT OF 10FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOODNIGHT AND GOOD LUCK .",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
This is a movie that is a step down from Snatch and Pulp Fiction but still an absolutely must see,"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) is a movie I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time after DVR'ing it on Indie TV. The storyline follows a group of friends who have to work together to help a friend repay a gambling debt. Unfortunately for them if they fail they will all die instead of just their friend. They set out on a mission to conduct a robbery but little do they know they aren't the only ones on the hunt that night.This movie is directed by Guy Ritchie (Snatch) and stars Jason Statham (Snatch), Jason Flemyng (Deep Rising), Vinnie Jones (The Midnight Meat Train), Steven Mackintosh (Memphis Belle), Nick Moran (Harry Potter), Dexter Fletcher (Rocketman) and Sting (Dune).This storyline contains fantastic characters, comedy and intricacies. The soundtrack is also amazing. The cast is perfectly selected and it was fun seeing a young Statham and Vinnie Jones. Jones and his character's son were my favorite characters in this by far. There's some outstanding scenes in this - the card game, the initial robbery to steal the shotguns, the ""I'll kill ya"" conversation and every scene with Sting were perfect.Overall this is a wonderfully put together movie that will give you Pulp Fiction vibes.

Just when you thought...,"Just when you thought it couldn't get any more complex or complicated this British film with overtones of `Trainspotting' will take you one step farther.The plot seems simple:  How to get money that is owed to a very nasty person.But with all things that appear simple there is amazing complexity.The dialogue may be difficult for many people to understand  it is true British working class  and a lot of it is very foul.There is an amazing amount of violence in the film.  So much so that you may even want it to be there when it isn't.There is a lot of hard-drinking, swearing and bloody violence  none of it subtle; but for some reason you still want to like the poor jerks that got themselves into the mess they did and hope that they get out of it intact.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Excellent film...,"If you like good acting, interesting dialect, twisting plot lines, action, comedy, deceit, or just like movies in general, then this movie is a must see.

The direction is great accompanied by some rather simple, yet highly effective cinematography. The story never drags. In fact, it is quite compelling. If you're used to American films, that is to say, you've never really sat down and watched any movie remotely foreign, than I must highly suggest this movie as a wonderful change of pace.

You should take a butchers at this film...,"I love this film, particularly the dialogue, which I am still translating the 3rd or 4th time around. Not only is it quick, clever and funny, it is almost lyrical.The script may be one of the film's weaknesses though. For example, ""keep your Adams on"" - did Adam Ant sell records anywhere outside the UK, or to anyone other than 20something Brits? For someone who cannot be bothered to concentrate on the words, or for whom English is a second language, this film may not live up to the 9/10 I give it.The film is also quite stylish (to my taste, which might not be saying much).  I like the soundtrack and the dateless feel, references to 'a bad day in Bosnia' are 90's, but the cars and the London streets are more reminiscent of films and TV shows from the 60's and 70's.

Great,"I only recently viewed this film, and it is really a great effort.  Sadly, I saw Snatch before I saw this one, and I think had it been the other way around, I would've enjoyed Lock, Stock a little more.  The director's vision here is distinct, sharp, and in your face (much like with Snatch).As is the case with Snatch, a lot of the humor here (for Americans) is in listening to the dialogue of the characters.  The situations are also hysterical, but wouldn't be nearly as funny without the bantering of the people on screen.  Rated it 8 of 10 (Snatch = 10).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Meanwhile in Pulp Fiction, you know what's going on, you just don't know where it's going. I can't believe this got such high ratings and that people said it was actually funny.

It's not _______ meets _______  with an edge. It's better.,"I saw a preview screening of this movie today with my brother and we both enjoyed the film immensely.Being born and raised in Canada, the both of us most likely missed a fair bit of the dialogue due to accents and slang, but from what we did pick up loud and clear, we were grateful for.The film's story is its strength, and colourful characters being its stock in trade. Executed beautifully and edited quite nicely, the film's pace was engaging and flawless.A certain pop singer's cameo appearances actually elicited laughter from the audience, I'm not sure whether that tone was intended or not.There's a certain playful attitude that will require a suspension of disbelief, a certain element of embellishment in story telling is employed and certain characters are larger than life for comic effect.It seems inevitable that some people will compare this film to ""Trainspotting"", or even ""Trainspotting"" meets ""Rounders"" with a hard edge of ""Reservoir Dogs"" thrown in for good measure. Now if you've seen those movies and enjoyed them, I'd be surprised if you didn't enjoy this one, but don't be looking for those elements.

Buy it. You better buy it!,"Lock Stock has much to offer and will go down as a classic of British film. Guy Ritchie's first outing to the world of feature films is one that exudes a talent long lost (hard to find!) in the world of hollywood.Lock Stock offers an emmersive storyline that will have you on the edge of your seat as you watch the seperate plots twist and turn and climax together in an almost surreal joining that will have you marvel at it's brilliance. (10/10)Guy's directing is simply demonstrated by his ability to use unknown actors (The Govn'r (real life wide boy), Vinnie (football hardcase)) and intergrate them into the film seamlessly, a true mark of ability for any director.The switching between plots is perfect, keeping you guessing exactly how each subplot effects the others and drumming your fingers waiting for that inevitable collision that is bound to happen.  The theme track that supplements the film is a lesson to the many directors who are yet to realise how to harness its value adding abilty.Art direction / cinematography is brilliant but one has to say that Guy owes a lot to Martin Scorcesse, from the card scene to car door scene (you'll understand when you see it),  although this lacks his own imagination he does it very well, and he shows a lot of potential in this area. (9/10 -2 for copying).In round up this film is a must see, but has been made for a british audience, and may not translate well (the use of language is half its charm).

"Over-rated. Too inspired. But, not all the way worthless.","Surprisingly hyped, mediocre, but relatively entertaining film. Curious as a cult hit and pretty big splash over seas, but i found it to amount to nothing more than another hip gangster film clone. Pulp Fiction mined such territory perfectly, and Lock, Stock... belongs with all those other pale imitators like 3 Days in the Valley and Things to do in Denver... I guess the British gobbled it up because it was something they could call their own, something hip instead of another bland Merchant-Ivory tea cozy film.The whole hip modern gangster genre lends itself to such cookie cutter plotting. They all become far too obvious. Basically, every character in Lock, Stock... is a thug, and every character has bits of humor laced in. They can all be divided into two camps-the likeable small time criminals like our protagonists, and the menacing underworld figures like Hatchet Harry, Big Chris (though he's on the intimidating AND likeable side because of his son), and Rory Breaker. All in all, most of the characters have very little in terms of development, most are just caricatures, and are defined, more less, just by their cool sounding names.The chain reaction of events is about the only thing that holds the film together. As disappointing the characters and story may be, you still can't help but want to see how it all comes to a head at the conclusion.Ritchie didn't strike me as any great wunderkind. The story does have its moments, but it doesn't feel original. (example: the unexpected, ""guy gets hit by a car out of nowhere"" was already used in Pulp Fiction, and, as some might not know,Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia and the novella Perdita Durango)File it under, I've seen all it before, and better. Directing-wise he falls prey to relying on the same devices to the point of becoming tiresome (the slo motion, the tracking shot scenes, ect.), and any personal flair he may have suffers under this reliance. He didnt strike me as very special, like, say, Hard Eight did for P.T Anderson, Bad Taste with Peter Jackson, or other such debuts.  The look of the film- As a photographer, I personally hold much disdain for the whole harsh lighting thing he uses in indoor scenes. Grainy film is great, but the overexposure and sheen that the lighting gives turns my stomach.Best character- the strong presence of Vinnie Jones as Big Chris. Worst character- Vas Blackwood as Rory Breaker, who in no way intimidated or impressed me as the film so much desired him too.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
10/10 one of the best movies I've seen,"I love this movie so much I watch it 4 times a year. The way it's written/directed is brilliant. Characters are developed beautifully and the way the story is setup is magnificent .I love how everything links up .Guy Ricthie thanks for making this film I truly love it. For me this is much better than Snatch which I also love .Enjoy this fun ride pacing is perfect . There's never a dull moment .Hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.

"FUNNY, FUNNY FILM!!!","Guy Ritchie has a way of making black comedy move beyond the Pale.  When you consider that the Pale was the region around Dublin where an Englishman could travel in safety, the notion takes on even more meaning.  Why does this film, a portrait of Marginal people who are all screwed up some way, work?  Well, there is a certain innocence to the characters which when coupled with their more malicious side creates chaos.  But, hey, isn't this the usual state of affairs in the human condition?  Aren't we all screwed up just a bit in some bizarre way?  This is a constant theme in the films of Joel and Ethan Coen and here, we find their counterpart in the backstreets of London.  But, it takes more than simply recognizing that we're all a bit goofy somewhere underneath to make a funny film and the likes of Vinny Smith, Jason Statham and the rest of the gang, combine to leave us howling for more. I know I was.  Why would an old geezer like me read all 270+ reviews here before writing these words that will likely never be seen? Well, it has to do with wanting to see if others saw what I did.  Most did. A few didn't.  We expect that. But, the vast majority found this film to be a riot.  I did.  I'm looking forward to seeing more from this crazy young Scot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Another edgy little British Film,"The Brits seem to make two kinds of films: costume dramas from the days of the empire and edgy, dark ,stories about the working classes featuring young, very Brit-looking actors.

Though it might take one, two, or even three viewings to get a handle on the accents, you won't mind sitting through it again--and again.

Some kind of a bloody joke...,"""Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?"" ""Oh, you must be the brain of the operation!"" ""What d'you do when you're not buying stereos, Nick? Finance revolutions?""Sorry, didn't know your father."" ""Never mind son, you just might meet him if you carry on like that."" And I could go on and on, mentioning an epiphora-driven monologue involving the act of killing a Greek whose stupidity might be the one saving grace or some snarky remark about Liberia's deficit in a skyrocket. It all comes down to one observation, if there is one deficit Guy Ritchie's ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" doesn't suffer from, is in one-liners. If anything, this is a film that made me aware, in my late teen years, of something called a screenplay. This is the work of a talented screenwriter, there's no doubt about that.Now, how about the director's perspective? And how about my appreciation, now that I'm twice the age I was when I first saw it? Well, the film still got it, as far as my enjoyment is concerned, but there are a few buts (and I'm not talking of marijuana cigarette butts or the lovely one belonging to that stripper's who caught the attention of Barry the Baptist, before assigning two Northern slobs some theft job involving the two titular barrels).So, ""but"", I was saying.I don't know if ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is more about revealing the talent of a British director making his spectacular and stylish debut, or if it more consolidates the status of an American director as the most defining and influential director of his generation, quite a stunt for someone in his mid-30's. While it is obvious that Ritchie has a great way with words and his screenplay features one of the highest ratio of one-liners per minute from any film, it was still Tarantino who exposed that new vision of the underground world, one that would never be afraid to be offensive and raunchy if laughs were the pay-off.It was easier to embrace that form of entertainment once it was done, so let's give QT the credit he deserves and get back to Ritchie. Indeed, it would be unfair to associate his 1998 hit film only to the influence of Tarantino, you can actually spot many influences that cover a wide range of cinematic genre and directors, you have a nod to Sergio Leone's ""For a Few Dollars More"", Zorba, you have smart-ass lines like the kind Groucho Marx would deliver, and in fact, the whole movie that seems like a kaleidoscope of all the archetypes nourished from years of movies, poker-games, drug trafficking, caper story, shaggy dog stories and other mix-ups, except that Ritchie used to direct ads' clips.This might be the one part where he diverges from Tarantino, one started from scratch, mostly through imitating other directors, Ritchie had his own style. And there are instances where you can tell the film is directed like a video clip, or an ad.""Lock, Stock"" is like a big, boisterous, joke whose only purpose is to entertain, and I respect that, because entertainment is Guy's strongest suit. He doesn't even need a main protagonist, the leading quartet, Eddie, Tom, Soap and Bacon, whose most notable presence is Jason Statham and to a lesser extent Tom Flemyng (but to play fair with the cast, let's mention Jason Flemyng and Dexter Fletcher), these guys are all down-on-their-luck outcasts, with one toe in the criminal world, and another in traffics, so benign it would never raise the attention of Scotland Yard. These guys are so 'inoffensive' really that they're not even affected by the bloody chain of events they caused.And the whole story relies on the four protagonists' luck when it comes to their mission about getting the money to pay for a debt Harry Hatchet (PH Moriarty), or avoiding to get their fingers cut off by Barry the Baptist (Lenny McLean), or cross the path of Big Chris, convincingly played by former soccer player Vinnie Jones. It is very ironic that the main concerned one don't ever realize what has happened, and no less ironic that Jason Statham, the ultimate tough guy isn't given enough occasion to be the celebrated bad-ass he is. The film is like a private joke between Ritchie and the audience, because what matters is what we see, who cares about the rest. We don't even see the blood, which is a nice touch that keeps this film in a sort of jolly friendly mood.Ritchie knows we're familiar with all these archetypes and what he does is providing a little twist, never wasting a moment for a wisecrack and a smart-ass line, it's almost a signature in his films. And it works, because he's like Tarantino, he belongs to the generation of directors influenced by other directors but who demonstrate how much of fans they are by adding a touch of modernity, and this modernity is made of close-ups, slow-mo, shootouts, every trope of the action genre. You can call it ""exercise in style"", the term isn't to be used negatively, it's got style, it's fun, energetic and crazy. And it's got a terrific casting, too, but it's mostly for Lenny McLean who died shortly after the film and Vinnie Jones that the film works,, honorable mention too for Van Blackwood who with Nick the Greek, form a nice duo.This is a film that shows a new face for British movies, one that comes right after ""Trainspotting"", ""The Full Monty"", a popular British type of movies that completes the work of Tarantino. It's a product of its era that encapsulates the level of creativity reached by directors who didn't have much budget, really one of the gems of the 90's.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"""It's a deal, it's a steal, it's the best film of the 20th century!!!!","If I were to chose one, just one, movie of all the ones I've seen and say that this is with no doubt my absolute favorite one I would pick Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Because, in my opinion, it is the best movie ever created.The most important thing for a film is story. And most of the good stories are based around the characters. And Lock, Stock has got some of the best characters around. Barry the Baptist, Ed, Soap, Tommy, Bacon, The Ganja Guys, Rory Breaker, Big Chris & Little Chris, Hatchet Harry, the list goes on and on. And each and every one of them get's their moment to shine.The second most important thing is how you tell the story. In some cases, it is actually more important than the actual story. A person who had actually heard the famous fairy teller H.C. Andersen said that he was popular for his way of telling a his stories. And if anyone can tell a good story it is Guy Ritchie. The way you get the story in Lock, Stock is really, really sweet.Sure, Guy has obviously been inspired by Quentin Tarantino, but he is not the only one. Lock, Stock contains the essence of good film-making from the last centuary and, for example, the movie has also got a lot of references to the works of Sergio Leone.So to me this movie is perfect. The actors, script, characters, dialouge etc. Every single piece. There is a reason this is my favorite movie of all time.Well, I can't talk any more know.

THE BEST Mafia movie ever?,"This movie what its called prefect , the perfect balanced between crime action comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Style Over Substance,"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is a film that is often at times fairly entertaining, and funny, but it seems to stop just there as a film that favors style over substance. This film is fairly basic fare as far as the plot goes for crime movies: four guys lose a bunch of money and have one week to get it back, and they decide to turn to thievery to obtain it.First off I will mention what I really liked about this film. First and foremost the cinematography steals the show, proving just how beautiful a film shot on 16 mm can look; as well the directing by Guy Ritchie is really well done, and he definitely gives the film a visual flare that is very reminiscent of a young Martin Scorsese; then the music is really great throughout, the whole soundtrack consisting of great British rock; on top of all that the acting is really well done through out. All of the stuff mentioned above really helps lend this film to a style that is both pleasing to the senses and often entertaining, and you might wonder where I found a problem with the film, and it is the story. The story seemed like a good, entertaining concept, but it never fully met its potential. The story just got bogged down by way too many characters and plot twists, there were just way too many. Now the screenplay had some truly terrific dialogue and some funny scenes written in, but majority of the comedy had nothing to do with the overall story. Then to cap all of that off, the film ran on for at least a good 15-20 minutes longer than it probably should have.Overall it is a film that is only worth watching for its well done style, but for no other real reason. Now if you love cinematography it is at least a definite rental, but if you don't, you should definitely skip it because you will most likely find the story too overstuffed to enjoy. It just seemed like it was trying too hard to be Pulp Fiction, but it failed.I give Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels a 4 out of 10!",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Ladies and gentlemen, we have a winner...","Guy Ritchie may not be the most productive writer and director, but he certainly is a famous man. That has probably a lot to do with the woman he once married (Madonna if you didn't know it yet), but the amateurs of great comedies and crime movies know him for some other reason too. With the TV series ""Lock Stock and ..."" and movies like ""Snatch"", and this ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", he has done some excellent work.While four friends find themselves in deep trouble after a crooked card game (if they don't want to lose some of their fingers, they have an enormous debt to pay in a week time to the local gang-land boss and porn king Harry 'The Hatchet' Lonsdale), they overhear their neighbors in the next flat plotting to hold up a group of pot growers. They decide that they will steal the money from their neighbors after the hold-up. In the meantime the same Harry Lonsdale has found a pair of antique shotguns that he would like to own, but for which he doesn't want to pay of course. He has it arranged that they are stolen from the retired owner, but the two not exactly brilliant thieves make a mess of the job and sell the guns to Nic the Greek, a small-time hustler. Because our four friends will need some weapons, they ask Nic the Greek to sell them something. All he can give them are two old shotguns...Even though most of the actors aren't exactly very well known, they all did a wonderful job together. But if I have to chose one of the 'unknown' actors as the best, than I would probably say Vinnie Jones. Since his career as a professional soccer player, he not only has the reputation of being a tough guy, he's also excellent in playing this kind of roles in the movies. It doesn't happen very often that someone who has never had a good schooling as an actor is still able to act very well in a role that is larger than the average cameo, but Vinnie Jones proves that it is possible.But the acting isn't the only good thing about this movie. The story is very nice of course, but it also has been shot and edited in an excellent way (it never clearly shows the most gruesome violence, but only gives a hint of it). It all looks very modern and classic at the same time, making this movie an interesting instant classic. And when you add to this nice concept some fine humor and some excellent music, than you know that you have a winner. I had a great time while watching this movie and was constantly laughing with it. I give this movie an 8.5/10. In my opinion this is one of the best comedies of the nineties.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

I liked how this film was able to blend comedy and violence much to my delight.Ritchie's film is about a self-confident guy who goes into a card game against a powerful crime lord and loses. Now in debt and fearing for his life, Eddy and his three friends decide to rob a small-time gang next door in order to pay off their debts.This film has some really good acting.

I wish Statham dabbled in more comedy later in his career because he can be funny, as this film proves. The other actors in Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, and Nick Moran all do well. Every actor seems to be having a fun time and they have good chemistry with each other.Overall, this is an entertaining British comedy and is one hell of a film debut. Guy Ritchie is very talented and it's evident in the direction of this film. He also knows how to make a screenplay for sure. This and Snatch are the two films that will define his career.

Nick Moran was interesting as Eddie, the card-playing pro of the gang and son of the town's famous bar owner. Jason Stathan gets a good start on his movie career as Bacon, the street-peddler of the gang.Now for all of the others (Skip this part if you'd like). P.H. Moriarty is great as Hatchet Harry, leader of a large money lending gang and owner of several porn shops. Lenny McLean was a personal favorite as Barry the Baptist, Harry's enforcer who got his name by drowning people. Vinnie Jones was perfect in his first movie role as Big Chris, Harry's messenger of sorts who loves nothing but his son, Little Chris (played by Peter McNicholl). Frank Harper was super as Dog, the angry, hateful neighbor of Eddie and Bacon and leader of his little ""gang"". Steve Sweeney was hilarious as Plank, Dog's little messenger boy. Huggy Leaver and and Tony McMahon were good as Paul and John, Dog's gang members. And Ronnie Fox was funny as Mickey, Dog's Bren-carrying gang member. Steve Mackintosh was excellent as Winston, the leader of the pot-growing gang and only serious thinking member of his group. Nicholas Rowe, Nick Marcq, and Charles Forbes were funny as J, Charles and Willie, the stupid pot-growers. Vas Blackwood was well-fit to play Rory Breaker, the angry, serious gang leader. Stephen Marcus was funny as Nick the Greek, the stupid merchandise seller. Jake Abraham and Victor McGuire were a great pair as Dean and Gary, the two morons hired by Barry the Baptist to steal guns for Hatchet Harry. Suzy Ratner was good as semi-conscious Gloria. Sting was great as JD, bar-owner and Eddie's father. And Alan Ford was excellent as Alan the bartender, JD's friend and the Narrator of the movie.Well, thats all I got. I miss anything? No? Good.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Taking the British gangster genre to new and scary places.,"I've always liked Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. I've always admired the energy and the manner in which director Guy Ritchie doesn't necessarily tell us a brilliant story but does get across a feeling of urgency; a sense of desperate times calling for desperate measures. Lock, Stock very much falls into that mid-late nineties cannon of British crime films revolving around the youth of the day, getting mixed up in criminal activity rather than being out and out gangsters themselves. With Lock, Stock; you don't get the feeling anyone who's under the age of thirty really wants to do what they're doing, it's either for a laugh or because they're forced to.Films such as Shopping and Trainspotting could be seen as precursors to Lock, Stock. They were crime orientated films but crime orientated films about youth getting mixed up in irregular criminal activity such as drug taking, dealing and ram-raiding. They were not gangster films about gangsters per-se like The Krays or Mona Lisa  two films from just before said films' time. However Lock, Stock combines the two ideas of youth involved in crime and the gangster genre as a whole and delivers an experience that has you sit back, put your feet up and enjoy a runtime of smart dialogue and faced paced that still worked on me all these years and viewings later. The film delivers a rapid array of scenes and visual styles more akin to music videos or perhaps even blockbusters as transitions and gimmicks fill up the screen and aid in playing out the events.Along with Snatch. two years later, Ritchie took inspiration from Tarantino's groundbreaking Pulp Fiction and gave British audiences not so much a breath of fresh air like what Tarantino did, but an alternative  an alternative to the stuffy and somewhat clichéd image of the British gangster as a hard bodied man who ran industries and dealt with anyone who crossed him. The best moment that gives us ammunition to read into this is one of the final few scenes in the film in which an unexpected shoot out occurs in a sex shop owner's office. The 'clichéd' image of a gangster character utters the words after a great shock: ""What the (expletive) are you doing here!?"". This question is directed at a character of many years his junior and is a question that rings true from all 'stuffy' imagined gangster characters as Lock, Stock arrives: the 'lads culture' of the gangster genre has arrived and the old guard cannot believe it  best summed up in that one shoot out nearer the end.But this is just fuel for an oppositional reading and I happen to have enjoyed almost all of the pre-Lock, Stock gangster films that I've seen (Brighton Rock and The Long Good Friday are my favourites). The 'criminals' in this film or at least the protagonists are young, cocky and without too much of a care. They are not criminal kingpins; they do not have an empire to run; they have not served time in jail  they have unspectacular jobs like market salesman or chef and yet they are placed in a situation against forces much higher than them and can only rely on criminal activity that just happens to be on their doorstep to bail them out.A lot of what Ritchie does to tear apart the gangster ideation (both image and genre) is to do with comedy. A lot of the content in this film would never, ever be seen in any gangster film prior to 1998 and a lot of the humour would not be presented as being so light hearted. In this film, a 'psychotic black man with an afro' will sit behind a desk and a wall of screens displaying motorcars whilst sucking on an iced-lolly, something that both challenges what the image of a gangster might be and simultaneously tempts us to laugh at someone of this stature. Indeed when the film threatens to go 'dark' with this character over the volume of a TV in a pub, an amusing voice-over and use of subtitles distracts us from the uneasy conflict on screen. In fact it happens twice; this time the four lads of the film react with a sarcastic holler after the film's soundtrack has died for said psychotic black gangster's emphasised reply of: 'No'.Lock, Stock at its core is a guerrilla film but it's a guerrilla film with an ideation of: 'yes, it realises what's transpired in the past and now it's going to blow away the cobwebs and do something outrageous.' But as a film and a filmmaker, Ritchie creates enough ambiguity and tension through the job itself (which is well structured: they must get through the locked gate, deal with someone hidden in the back, negotiate the disguised girl on the couch and then get away but the comic element of the traffic warden keeps everything 'light') but he also pays close attention to his soundtrack. James Brown's 'The Boss' over Big Chris' looming figure works well as does 'Liar, Liar' as Eddie blags his way through the card game with a light Reggae track over some stoners works equally well.The film evens finds time to dedicate dialogue to the moving away from gangster films gone by. One character buys some guns of another and the seller retorts that ""sawn-offs are out"" further moving Lock, Stock away from that old fashioned image of Brit gangsters and their sawn-off shotguns. People want more 'range' these days is another quip  he is right but the range is in the toying with genre conventions. Apart from bending all the rules, Lock, Stock is a fast and furious ride down slapstick gangster alley that, at least for me, still holds up after so many viewings  it's just good fun among other things and Ritchie knows when to keep the film dramatic amongst everything else that happens.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Highly enjoyable.  A must see,"This is an excellent film.  Guy Ritchie did an excellent job in both the writing and directing department.  The dialogue is quick and funny.  Even in the most serious parts Ritchie delivers a bit of quick wit and makes us laugh.  The washed out look of many shots and the liberal use of slow motion and freeze frames really work in the movie as opposed to becoming an impediment on the flow.  The actors all do a really good job especially the guy who plays Big Chris.   Having Sting in it makes the movie even more bad ass, even if he only has a very bit part.  I really liked this movie.

"""iT WouLD Be a CRiMe To MiSS it. BReaTHTaKiNG- *10/10*","It takes film directors years to achieve this kind of status, as opposed to just carefully planning your first feature film from scratch. Against seemingly impossible odds, dogged by the ignorant film companies, Ritchie succeed in making a masterpiece. There are simply too many good points to comment on about this film, but the rhythm of it is ingenius in it's own way. The film may have been partialy inspired by that of the late Pulp Fiction, but uses a far more complex storytelling moethod, with more characters, more slapstick, and sarcasim. The main theme in genereal of the film is ""sarcasim"" i.e. it's not funny to laugh at someone being shot, but now after seeing this it is. The film is ideal for all British, and European audiences, but for viewrs in America may be unsuitable, as it's difficult for someone who speaks with a strong American accent to follow regional English accents such as Scouse, Cornish, and Cockeny, which are frequently or partially recurrent throughout the film. The thing I thought most highly of this film was the way in which the sharp editing techniques and special FX blended in nicely with the background music & songs, portraying an almost real depiction of what it's like to be either devastated or horizontally-drunk beyond visualisation. Also teh way in which it's filmed. A highly-expensive rocket-fuel-iggnition lensed camera was used to achieve the glossy golden look that is underground London--go on my son'' Watch this then be spun, then watch it over to see stuff you missed.

A Dark Comedy mixed with a fresh storyline and a splash of drama,"Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels comprises a beautiful mix of comedy and gritty gangland drama. The plot surrounds four friends who pool their money together for one of them to enter a poker competition, unfortunately they lose, and have only one week to come up with the cash. This surprisingly simple yet dangerously overwhelming problem soon see's the four friends become embroiled in another gangs plot to steal large amounts of weed and money off a supposedly small time outfit run by ex-students trying to make a quick buck.The plot set against a gritty London background has an intense mix of humour and drama that makes a compelling watch. The film itself has a real sense of quality and yet made on very little money. The script is something that makes this film a bench mark to a new genre, it becomes more complex as the plot thickens, yet when broken down it is simplistic, you feel drawn in by it and not quite sure what might happen next, mainly because of the many other sub plots that run alongside the main story. The best way to some up this film is that each aspect has been carefully compiled letting very few details go unnoticed (maybe the acting on very few occasions)but when spliced together it is a work of art, a perfect balance of humour, drama, tension and intricate story telling leading to a fantastic Crescendo. In conclusion, although this film lacks some of the emotional content a film such as Schidlers List has, its design and general plot make it a superb watch, anyone who hasn't seen this film, please don't wait any longer go to your local entertainment centre and buy a copy because this is a sure bet!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Funny, but not the funniest...","For originality and the fact that there were some funny lines, and I like the director, Guy Richie, that's why I'm giving it a five.The whole time proceeding my seeing this film, I was told by everyone that it was a must see and a fantastic film. A cult classic, some might even be so bold as to say, however I did not find it that enthralling. It was a movie made for guys, and although I will be hypocritical saying this since I love the average chick flick, it's not a film most women will probably like, since there was only one in the whole movie. The story is cleverly written, and definitely one you have to pay attention to, in order to follow what's going on.Again, the kind of humor that this is, I can totally see a bunch of guys roaring with laughter over, however my moments of smiles and giggles were few and far between. The writing was very good, and I as I said before, I love Guy Richie, so I loved the directing as well. But, I have to say that it's not the funniest, or even best underground Brit comedy I've ever seen. Better than 'The Full Monty', I will give it that much, but it's just not that good.All in all if you're a guy, you'll more than likely enjoy this movie, but ladies be forewarned, Man Clan film, and there aren't a lot of romantic scenes, actually none...so if you're the kind of person that's looking for a romantic comedy, you've rented the wrong film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"Wodehouse farce, but with more blood","People have complained about this for being sub-Tarantino but it's not at all like, say, Reservoir Dogs; it just looks that way because of the blood and the swearing. At heart this is a P G Wodehouse-type farce with antique guns instead of cow-creamers and dodgy back-room clubs instead of Picadilly gentlemens' clubs. Lots of running around and shouting keeps the pace lively and the jokes - and all-important set-ups - are genuinely funny. This film comes as such a relief after the anodyne sentimentality of Sliding Doors and the pseudo-intellectual witticisms of Shakespeare in Love (they were funny in their own way, but their own way can be a bit annoying). It's so great to see the old music-hall farce routines united with the modern gritty shoot-em-up so harmoniously, and that the result is still funny is really something to admire.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Great, once past the accents.","First off, I heard no hype about this movie, just got handed the DVD by a friend with a short 'Watch it'. Big thanks to him ! Its probably also why I enjoyed LSTSB immensely, repeatedly and unashamedly. It's basically all the things Tarantino aims for ( and sometimes even hits ), gritty, tough-but-humourous and entertaining from the outset. Less hype, but much better delivery all around !The cast of protagonists, villains and even the sidekicks is truly memorable while satisfyingly 'fresh', and thanks be to the higher powers, Mr. Travolta does not dance ! Also, avid fans of Sting should not hold their breath in anticipation, his 3 minutes of fame are more than enough. And yes, the plot is slightly complicated, with some flashbacks, humour, at its blackest parallel storylines and unexpected twists, but so is life.... Its actually necessary to listen to the dialogue full-time to get all the good ones and anyone not enjoying it should consider having his brainpan checked out for dryrot, ASAP(or watch 'Mary Poppins').The plot itself is neither overly brutal( while deadly !), nor clicheed, but a well-constructed, fast-paced treat, and one could only wish that more scriptwriters where as circumspect in plotting for a memorable show-down. The same goes for the soundtrack.As for those 'critics' claiming that LSTSB ripped off 'Holy Tarantino' who BTW shamelessly ripped off everybody else, and recently failed miserably, even with a decent script to work from - just check out 'Jackie Brown') I should point out that anyone who builds something similar, yet definitely bigger and better, does not 'rip off', he improves ! Sorry that Mr Ritchie is a Brit, and , 'oh terrible woe' the boyfriend of trite Madonna, but, lets face it, this movie is much better value than 'Pulp fiction' or 'Reservoir Dogs'.There are only two potentially troublesome points to be kept in mind - first off the sometimes videoclip-like aesthetics ( hard on the eyes) , and second, the extremely thick accents ( which in themselves are wickedly funny, just hard to get ), which baffle the even the non-hearing-impaired ( but then again, so does Morgan Freeman, and he even got an Oscar for it...), and I expect, may be challenging for many Americans and non-english speakers alike.Besides this, a great movie ( and if it had been done by Q.Tarantino, a lot less people would gripe unfairly about it.... ) !9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"What are you talking about ""ain't original""?","Because it features a slew of sharp-tongued characters with a complex plot and a retro soundtrack, suddenly Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels is a rip-off?  It's a hilariously original comedy with hordes of interesting characters to examine, interpret, and guess the outcomes of.  It is modern and has it's fare share of violence, yes, but that doesn't mean it's carbon-copy Tarantino.  Tarantino is all style.  He's there to be cool and slick, let the audience on a ride.  Guy Ritchie is about making people laugh while keeping them interested.  There's action to keep your eyes open and your mind out of the gutter, but it backplays that with a witty comment at the end.  I know some people don't find a dozen people getting shot funny, no matter how awkward or Euripidean the situation is.  I understand that, and so do the filmmakers.  This is not a movie for all people.  It's a movie for people who like things fast paced.

locked stocked and smoked,"Now I've seen just about everything. After watching Snatch last week I thought movies couldn't get any funnier than that. Well, I was most certainly wrong. They can, and Lock Stock Two Smoking Barrels has. The array of its dynamic scene proportion is just amazing. At first you can barely follow the storyline since there are so many characters present and so many plots, that keep getting more and more complex. But as the time passes, it all comes to logical disentanglement. Camera moves strictly according to the momentary state of the character in momentum.Though actors were unfamiliar to me, they did their part one hundred percent flawlessly. Their lines are absolutely hilarious, yet clinging to the edge of tasteless swearing.

Top notch movie that is still ahead of the TV series,"Tarrantino comes to London in the guise of Guy Richie.Lock Stock is a gem of a movie about 4 young rogues, but generally nice guys, who decide to play their hands at the poker table with £100,000 of their savings.Only problem is that even though they are quite streetwise they're clearly out of their depth when playing against Hatchet Harry, the local heavy. As a consequence they end up owing him half a million by next week otherwise its goodbye fingers & toes!The movie is superbly directed & choreographed by Madonna's latest boyfriend, Guy Richie. Clearly influenced by Tarrantino, Richie turns on the style with interesting camera angles, lighting, a cool soundtrack and a very witty script.The characterisation is full & rounded, although does sometimes vear towards the stereotypical, especially with the portrayal of the real bad guys - Hatchet & Co.But the other four guys you really do warm too; they're young, attractive, naive but they work off each other and make the film more believable & interesting.Of course, to British audiences they will have seen this kind of comedy/drama before: the TV series, Minder is a good case in point. And they'll also be in for a treat when they see former soccer player, Vinnie ""Hardman"" Jones, play a very good role as Big Chris, a muscleman with brains. I hope he appears in more movies, especially comedies, which would suit his character completely.But Richie also presents a darker, menacing side to the move. The violence is very much ""in ya face"" without actually seeing what's going on - a bit like the infamous ""ear"" scene in Reservoir Dogs.I suppose American viewers will find it difficult at first to understand the accent - well don't feel too left out, most of Britain isn't too well up on some of the Cockney Rhyming slang either. Although some would say it makes a nice change since the Brits have had to put up with understanding the language of the Streetwise Americans for years.That aside, the movie is excellent, and offers a very welcoming feel good factor.

An Ultimate An Classic Movie,"This is one of the best movies ever it has a great blend of black comedy along with some classic violent scenes, mixed with some funny and weird characters which had me in stitches, its unlike any other movies and is one of a kind - although pulp fiction has similar black comedy through out - they are miles apart even though there both ace. Every scene is exciting and class, Vinnie Jones is partciullary good in lock stock and his scenes are ace. It also has a quality soundtrack to go along with that - stone roses, ocean colour scene, James brown etc. It is a great watch. I dwelled on whether to give it a ten out of ten but I decided a nine is more than fair.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Hilarious and engaging,"The stingy Tom(Flemyng), seemingly clean-cut but deep-down possibly insane Soap(Fletcher), the fence Bacon(Statham) and the card-shark Eddie(Moran) are no strangers to the world of small or big-time crime of London's East End(which is the sole environment this takes place in, and it really brings it to the screen), and they've got 25K each, totalling at 100, which is the entry fee for the big game(that last-mentioned intends to win, bringing home quite a lot for the four) with Hatchet-Harry(Moriarty). It doesn't go as planned, and as his name might suggest to you, the H is not someone you want to owe money(he could send Barry the Baptist(McLean) at you... why call him that? 'cause he likes to drown people), and they have a week to come up with it. Meanwhile, their neighbours are planning to rob a group of pot-growers of their product and the wealth of profit it has brought in so far, and there are two antique rifles(hence the title) in play as well, and the various factions(did I mention there's a Samoan mob in this, too? The leader looks adorable, until he opens his mouth and threatens death and destruction, and you find yourself trusting him on that) are all after one or more of these items, either for what they're worth or because they have to, for someone else. There are a ton of mix-ups(the audience are the only ones to know everything that happens), and in addition to these surprising twists and turns, this is kept going a lot through the golden, quotable dialog(note that most of it is full of slang from the local area, and if you're not familiar with such, you may need subtitles to follow this) and these situations where people are threatened by this or that circumstance or person. This is a gangster-comedy-thriller, with a macho, very *guy* sense of humor to it. A lot of the fun comes from the quirk, as well. Ritchie loves him some dumb hustlers(here and in Snatch), and he plays with the camera and editing with the grace of a virtuoso, leading to a visually stylized film that never bores you. The characters are distinct, and for the sheer amount, that is as impressive a feat as how much screen time and development are actually afforded the lot of them. Everyone is well-cast and the acting is great. The types here are priceless. Vinnie Jones portrays an enforcer, as he should. This keeps to a marvelous pace. The 100 minutes fly by. There is a lot of brutal, bloody violence, strong language, crude references and a little nudity/sexuality in this. The DVD comes with a trailer for this. I recommend this to any fan of Guy, the leads and the British disposition. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Fast paced, engaging, funny!   Highly recommended!","This is a movie that I put off renting until there was nothing else on the shelves.  I know it had rave reviews printed on the box, but so did some other English films like ""The Full Monty"" , ""Trainspotting"", ""The General"", and ""Waking Ned Devine"".  Those were all films with ""rave reviews"", but I can't say I truly enjoyed any of them.  One of the things that irritated me was the accents.  They were hard to follow sometimes and it often interfered with my understanding of the plot.  Anyway, my lukewarm reaction to the above mentioned films caused me to stay away from ""Lock, Stock, and Smoking Barrels"" because I thought it would be similarly disappointing.  WAS I WRONG!  This film is an absolute gem.  The film I would best compare it to is""Pulp Fiction"".  This film is an extremely fast paced roller coaster ride of twists and turns from beginning to end.In a nutshell, it is about a group of guys who pool their money so one of them (A fellow with a talent for reading faces) can make a big score by playing poker with a local mobster.  Naturally, the fellow loses all his friends money, and then some. The guys then hatch a zany scheme to recoup their friends losses by carrying out a robbery.  I will not spoil the rest of the movie for those who have not seen it.  Highly recommended! One of the 10 best movies I have seen in 1999.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Sure, I watched great films last year like ""As Good As It Gets"", ""Good Will Hunting"", and ""L.A.

So why did I and so many others leg it to the shop on 1st March to buy Lock Stock and watch it over and over again? Many people will say that a film was ""pure entertainment"", and you should expect no more from an action movie. Well, nope, that's not what Lock Stock is about. What does it have then? It has a cast that give an authentic feel, if not Oscar winning performances. It has a black humour, a little overdone in places, but one that generally works well and seems to fit in with the characters and their location (i.e. you can only take cockney rhyming slang so seriously). It has a tugging, friendly plotline, that wrong foots your emotions once or twice and pokes you in the stomach, without ever *really* being twisty. It has an inconsiderate bass line, but only where your neighbours are concerned (it's great). It has Lenny McLean (RIP Lenny). It has an armoury of lines that you'll quote to your mates for weeks on end, to a point where they'll go out and  buy the film just so they know what the hell you're talking about.

Doesn't hold up that well,"This is one of those particular indie movies that had everyone clamoring for more at release, but like any mediocre stage magician the illusion can't be kept up for too long and the duct tape is showing everywhere once you look closer.Now Guy Ritchie has managed to pull the wool over everyone's eyes for long enough to build a career on this and a few of his later films are actually good, but his debut, especially with 20+ years of hindsight is nowhere near as good as I remembered it.Now I still love the british-ness of it all and the actors involved, but it's crystal clear this was assembled from an array of much better movies, mostly Tarantino, Scorsese and sprinkles of Boyle, with barely an original fibre in its body.Convoluted plot, a hip decade-bending soundtrack, tough as nails baddies with swanky nicknames and and a gang of too cool for school protagonists doing their witty banter back and forth. Tell me where you've heard that before and I can assure you you've already seen it done better and more effortlessly.There's something so incredibly fake about all the forced street coolness and toughness of this film, that it began to bore me to such a degree I couldn't even finish it this time. In fact there's something transparently fake about all of Guy Ritchie's gangster films, even when they work better. Once you read up about his incredibly privileged upbringing his attempts to mime both the british mob swagger and rough underclass charme become almost comical.Being desperate to be seen as cool is the opposite of cool and nowhere is this more apparent than here.Apart from the derivativeness and myriad stylistic mis-steps I don't think the movie is made all that well as just a piece of entertainment. It never really picks up speed despite the twists and turns of the plot, Ritchie seems indecisive how serious we should take the violence and the story and in the end it's all just a giant hodgepodge of half-ideas lacking a coherent vision or voice of its own, unless randomly over-exposing your shots counts as vision.May entice you more when you only watch it once, but for anyone else who remembers enjoying this film back in the day and who has seen other films in the genre since, I advice you to refrain from a repeat viewing.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"Great story, Great film","For `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', you can pretty much just refer to my review of Guy Ritchie's `other' great film, `Snatch', because everything that I love about `Snatch' can be supplanted with my feelings for `Lock, Stock'.  Less flashy than `Snatch', but with a brilliant script, `Lock, Stock' is a fantastic film.In `Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels', we encounter four London guys, three of whom are operating on a plane slightly on the wrong side of the law.  Tom, (Jason Flemyng) operates as a small-time fence, Bacon (Jason Statham) is a small-time street con and Eddie (Nick Moran) is Bacon's some time partner in crime, whose specialty is cards.  The fourth member of their circle, Soap, (Dexter Fletcher) is the one member of their group who, as a chef, tries to keep his nose clean at all times.  When the four of them get bored with barely surviving the lives they have mapped out for themselves, they each take their savings and give it to Eddie so that he can play in a high stakes poker game which he is almost certain to win.  This would all run smoothly if the guy who runs the game didn't cheat and therefore clean them out as well as an additional large sum of money, given to them on loan. The foursome then find themselves needing to come up with the money within a week or their lives are at stake, so they have to come up with a way to get the money fast.As with `Snatch', `Lock, Stock' has a large cast of colorful characters who intertwine with one another to make up one hell of a wild ride.  If two characters don't actually meet face to face, it is certain that they at least have a couple of people involved that they each know, which turns the plot into a kind of `Six Degrees of Anyone in the Film'.  What `Lock, Stock' doesn't have that `Snatch' has is star power (Brad Pitt, Benicio Del Toro) and presumably, the same budget, but the great thing is that it doesn't need either.  The acting by (at the time) relative unknowns to the general American audience is just great, and while there are some really great action scenes and some fun camera angles, the spectacle that accompanies `Snatch' is not as prevalent in `Lock, Stock.'  Still, the film is just as good  so does that make it a better film?  Definitely not; and choosing which Guy Ritchie film, for me at least, is like a mother choosing which child is her favorite.  (Yes, I'm that much of a film geek)  But `Lock, Stock' is an excellent, character and plot-driven film that deserves all of the accolades it has received, and then some.--Shelly",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"Knocks spots off ""The Full Monty""","From the moment the opening credits began to role I knew that I would enjoy this film. It's fast paced, wittily scripted, brilliantly filmed and non-stop hilarious from beginning to end. It appears to be a send up of the whole gangster mentality but manages to be disturbingly realistic at the same time (I know - I've met characters like many of those depicted). The violence may seem over the top but is more in the ""Tom & Jerry"" mould than a typical big screen gore-fest. What's more, it's never dwelt on but simply adds to the overall effect of extremely dark comedy.The acting, especially from Nick Moran (Eddie) and PH Moriarty (Hatchett Harry) is top notch and Vinnie Jones is a revelation. Having seen him from just a few rows back on the football terraces, I've known for years that the man has a certain presence that demands your attention - even when he hasn't got another player's vitals in a vice-like grip! It's great to see that this has transferred onto the big screen where, yet again, it's difficult to keep your eyes off him, no matter who else is on the screen. Admittedly the role of Big Chris hardly stretched him but it's a start and it remains to be seen whether he'll ever tackle something more challenging (one of Shakespeare's many clowns would be interesting). Anyway, enough about Vinnie.The almost surreal humour of the film was brought to the fore in the barman's scene (played by Danny John-Jules of ""Red Dwarf"" fame). It was hard to know what to pay most attention to: the subtitles at the bottom of the screen or the scene being played out behind it. The overall effect was quite literally shockingly funny and for those not well versed in Cockney dialect (yes -it is an actual dialect) it's worth seeing again until you've mastered the language and can enjoy the full effect of the action.With a body count more akin to a Jacobean tragedy than a Hollywood blockbuster, and the black wit and class acting to match, ""Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" reminds me of Danny Boyle's early days directing for the Royal Shakespeare Company before he went on to bigger and better things (""Shallow Grave"" & ""Trainspotting""). I'm sure he and his regular crew of writers, camera men (sorry, should that be camera persons?) and actors would be proud to have made a film such as this, which I hope those who were involved would take as a compliment.Well, that's about it, I s'pose. All I can say now is.... ""It's been emotional"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

A brilliant directorial debut,"How can I describe this movie in one sentence? A low budget but extremely well acted and directed movie.""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a gangster comedy with complex plot, dark humour and memorable characters. Writer-director Guy Ritchie did great on this, it's his first film. He is probably my favorite new director. It is a clear recommendation for everybody who enjoys good gangster films with humorous aspects, and if you liked Tarantino's films, this is a suggestion.The movie is about a poker player named Eddy .who is bankrupted by Hatchet Harry,a gambling and porn king. Harry cheats, Eddy runs up an enormous debt, Barry the Baptist explains that he will start chopping fingers of his friends if he don't pay up. What to do? So the action beginsbut you get the idea. Or maybe you don't. The plot is complex yet understandable and enjoyable. My first reaction was to compare Ritchie's style with that of Quentin Tarantino. On following reflection, no, director Guy Ritchie with this film has a style of his own. What impresses is the way Ritchie handles all of the story lines in this one story. He also does it in such a high-energy style that you have to stop and catch your breath. Ritchie also gets mostly unknown cast, but every single actor in this film does a great job of acting, each plays a unique character. Dialog, dialog, dialog! Don't get me wrong - there's plenty of action in this movie, but dialog (it happens seldom in a movie) are absorbing. As I said, this movie will not be every one's cup of tea. It contains a lot of violence, guns and shooting, blood, dead bodies, fighting. One may say that language is very strong, with multiple uses of ""f--k"" and various other words, including English slang. The plot involves marijuana growers and stolen drugs, there are no positive characters (it's great, what's to like in them?, positive characters are nearly the same) . But it is done tastefully, funny and fashionable. Finally, the music accompanying this film is excellent. Out of the perhaps several thousand movies I have seen , this was the first soundtrack that I downloaded and it is a very strong collection of old and new tunes that really added a lot to the atmosphere.

The best (modern ) British gangster movie,"Yes, we all know that Guy Richie married Madonna and, ever since then, many considered that the quality of his work somehow suffered.

And they were good.Okay, so you'll probably have to be okay with gangster films in general, not to mention plenty of foul language, unlikeable characters, excessive violence and probably some more bad language. If you can overlook all of those then you'll probably enjoy Lock Stock.They say that the simple ideas are the best and normally they're right. However, Lock Stock is anything but simple. Yes, the story is primarily about four lads who get in deep debt with a particularly unsavoury character, but that's only a small portion of it. There are numerous characters, each with their individual story lines. It just so happens that all of these story lines are somehow relevant to the central story and they all come together perfectly (and possibly violently). Along with the violence, language and nasties, you have to be prepared to concentrate. If you don't, you're likely to miss something vital to the plot and lose track of what's happening.But, if you do, you'll be rewarded by one of the most darkly comic, twisting tales of backstabbing and double-crossing. And, like I said, it's damn good.I won't go into the plot too much, simply because it's pretty complicated, but mainly because I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone. There's so much to be enjoyed about this film, you really have to experience it for yourself.Not to mention it contains the first ever on-screen appearance of Jason 'The Stath' Statham. What more could you want? You want more? What about the first ever appearance of ex-footballer Vinnie Jones in a role that was simply made for him? It has that, too. You really can't ask for more (unless you want to see someone executed with a s*x toy, but then it has that, too).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

One of my faveorites,"this movie is great, if you saw snatch and liked it then i recommend this one 100% this is one of my faveorite movies ranks in 4th. It is incredibly funny and action packed. The acting was great and the special features on the DVD amazed me as well. This is one of those movies that makes you think that crime does pay. The story line is one of pulp fiction where there are different stories but they all link together. It is one of those movies that you should buy and watch over and over again. It never gets old. These characters are some of the funniest i've ever seen. This movie is funnier than Dumb and Dumber (which is saying quite a lot). Pick this one up now. One of the best movies i have ever seen its amazing... Really.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Cool romp through the London underside,"Very cool. Excellent soundtrack. The outlaw perspective and ""debt-collecting"" owe something to Pulp Fiction but all in all the movie has more similarities to the recent British series ""Underworld"", which shared the same landscape of colourful characters and dark humour. I can see a run on this type of film given the richness of this backdrop.The dead-pan acting was hilarious. The script tight and well written.Definitely worth a look.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Vinnie Jones as doting father,"I'm not normally one for violent films - the only other one I really liked was ""Reservoir Dogs"" - but this one was such great fun despite the blood-splatter and the overall nastiness meted out to everybody. The story felt a bit like last man standing, and definitely a mythical look at life in the East End (""EastEnders"" being another). But hugely enjoyable to watch and I really didn't care which side would come out left standing and alive. I've always had a bit of a crush on Dexter Fletcher when he was in Derek Jarman's Caravaggio as a 20-something but he hasn't aged well 20 years on. Mind you, neither has Sean Bean, who was also in Caravaggio. But I digress. Sting definitely is a great actor and his eye close ups looked scary and creepy. But the real hero of the story is Vinnie Jones, who as a doting father just made me laugh out loud when chiding his son for using bad language while perpetrating the most sickening violence himself.

"Stylish, wicked fun - with Cockneys","At first glance, one might think that Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels - the debut film from the man later to be known as Mr. Madonna, Guy Ritchie - is little more than another in a long line of late-nineties Tarantino ripoffs.  And again, at first glance, you might be right.  There are the camera tricks, the hip sixties soundtrack filled out with James Brown soul classics, the slew of crimes gone wrong, and a collection of characters with goofy names like Hatchet Harry and Barry the Baptist.But that's the first glance, and as the old adage goes, first impressions can be deceiving.  What Ritchie has done is craft a film out of familiar subjects (a failed gambling risk, a harried deadline to pay off a debt, and a desperate gambit involving guns, drugs, and cash), and weave together a stylish, entertaining film.Overloaded with characters of dubious moralities, Lock Stock throws everything but the kitchen sink into the lives of four friends who have spent their lives skirting the edges of the law.  These four gather together $100,000 for Eddie, the card shark, to enter a high-stakes poker game.  Of course, the game is rigged, and he ends up owing half-a-million quid to Hatchet Harry - a man you pay, or face the consequences.  Lo and behold, an opportunity arises - the lads' neighbors are drug fences who knock over a marijuana dealer for cash and weed, and this could well answer all their prayers.  Of course, nothing quite works out the way anyone could expect.Due to everyone having thick British accents and making full use of the unique styles of Cockney slang (explained in a glossary on the DVD as a special feature), Lock Stock can sometimes be a difficult movie to follow, though once you get used to it, there are some gems of dialogue rolling through all the action.  Think Trainspotting with less drugs and more violence.The cast (mostly unknowns at the time), does a fine job of settling into the theme of the film - near-cartoonish posturing and constant games of king of the mountain populate almost every scene.  Sting pops up as Eddie's none-too-enchanted father, who redefines tough love, and soccer star Vinnie Jones is an effectively erudite brute as Big Chris, the 'collection agent' for Harry.  His departing line, 'It's been emotional,' is a classic.It's not original, not by any real stretch, and not terribly groundbreaking other than some of the unusual camera tricks Ritchie pulls off (my personal favorites being the poker scene and the 'get drunk after the big score' scene) - which are very much like music videos in style.  That said, there's nothing that keeps it from being a rollicking good time of a movie, something that's well worth watching again.  If only to figure out what those geezers are saying.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A hard-boiled funny gangster-movie,"First of all, excuse my spelling. I'm a swede...This is, except ""the seven samurais"", my absolute favourite movie of all time. It really rocks.The actual reason why I saw this movie was Vinnie Jones, ex soccer player. And his character, Big Chris is one of the funkiest in movie history.It is a very complicated story. Many roads crossing each other.

"entertaining, high energy crime comedy","""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" is a fun, highspirited and ingeniously plotted caper film from the ""good crooks vs. bad crooks"" school of crime drama.  This British comedy plunges us into a dizzying maelstrom of doublecrossing petty thieves, drug dealers, gamblers and assorted other criminal lowlifes whose paths cross in the streets and alleyways of London in clever and often fatal ways.The complex plot almost defies description.  Suffice it to say the film focuses on a quartet of likable smalltime hoodlums who amass a decent stake from the fencing of stolen property and  decide to risk it all on a high stakes card game with a notorious gangster named Henry, who has rigged the game, unbeknownst to Eddie, the cardsharp of the group.  When Eddie loses the money, the stage is set for a wild series of plots, counterplots, crosses and double crosses, all executed by writer/director Guy Ritchie with a refreshing cinematic flair that includes frenetic pacing and editing, clever use of slow and fast motion photography, and barely perceptible freeze framing, all backed up by a dynamic score humming along on the soundtrack.As a writer, Ritchie fills the screen with a delighful gallery of eccentric, offbeat and slightly off-kilter characters.  These are all too numerous to mention, but special note should be taken of Henry's chief henchman, Chris, who politely scolds  his young son and partner in crime for his use of unseemly language as he bashes the brains out of one of Henry's delinquent customers or insists on his buckling up for safety as they take off on one of their wild rides through ths crime-infested streets of London.Despite it's '90's level of graphic violence, the film strikes echoes of classic British crime comedies of the gentler 1950's.  It reminds one, in fact, of ""The Ladykillers"", wherein the bad crooks manage to eliminate each other through a maze of comic misunderstandings, leaving the ""good"" crooks thoughtfully untouched. Not that they don't learn their lesson, though, for, in the high stakes world of doubledealing criminals, our heroes discover that it takes a ruthless old pro to ultimately come out on top.  And that's as it should be in the world of crime drama.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Plot twists and black humour topped off with cracking performances !!,When our four anti-heroes find themselves fleeced into a huge gambling debt desperation to stay alive with all body parts intact provides the inspiration for a cheeky limb saving heist. The humour is blacker than pitch and the seemingly incongruent plot lines braid themselves into a tale that would raise a smile from Dickens. All of the performances are good  no nonsense business ones and Vinnie Jones blends into his role convincingly. A nice cameo from Sting as a bar owner.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Stylish and fun.,"I just love this type of British gangster film.  Stylish and violent with charming and likeable young characters.  In this case the hapless boys find themselves in way over their heads after an ill-fated card game.

Only the Smartest (or Dumbest) Survive!,"Stupidity can be a saving grace, for such an unfortunate state of mind causes the unexpected to happen (wisdom and foolishness are much alike, for both are indifferent to the opinions of the world). In the violent, testosterone laden underworld of London several unhinged, inexperienced and desperate characters tempt fate in this manner. They pool their resources and talents in the hope of winning a high stakes poker game. Of course, it does not go as planned and they find themselves at the mercy of thugs, bounty hunters, loan sharks, mobsters and other assorted wankers. Multiple people converge on a single target, and the smartest - or dumbest - will emerge from the fray.Guy Ritchie has a pulse on the dark humor, snarky characters and viciousness of the London underworld and it is fascinating and thrilling to behold. This low-budget first film brought him fame and comparisons to Tarantino. Insults fly as much as bullets. The soundtrack, including the Stone Roses, is quite good. I saw the film twice and liked it better the first time. Perhaps Ritchie films are losing the initial quirkiness and uniqueness that gave them luster?

Imitation is a form of flattery (Thank U Quentin),"""Lock, Stock and 2 Smoking Barrels"" is an entertaining but ultimately an evanescent work which pales in comparison to anything written and/or directed by the true master of the genre, Quentin Tarantino.Tarantino is brilliant at melding the old (Hong Kong & Blaxsploitation) with the new and along the way he created a whole new language of film.  As a result, Tarantino created some of the definitive films of the 90's.  Ritchie tries to do the same, except in this instance he tries to repackage Tarantino's work (Pulp Fiction, True Romance, & Reservoir Dogs) into something new.  The effect is not the same.  What was fresh in the Tarantino films seems ultimately derivative and overwhelmed by its own style.Looking at the backgrounds of Messrs. Ritchie and Tarantino can help give insight into where each artist is coming from.  Tarantino, by all reports, was the child of a working class single mother and he toiled away for years in a video store in the gritty South Bay of LA while eating, sleeping, breathing film.  Mr. Ritchie, whom the media purported to be a ""hoodie"" type, is anything but:  he grew up the child of privilege.  Both had to overcome their backgrounds to succeed in the business, but whose voice resonates stronger and more authentically?",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Simply one of the best movies to come out of London.,"I would call this movie the ""British Pulp Fiction"" though it is far better than Pulp Fiction. The plot is quite complex and begins with lots of different strands which are all brought together in a very interesting way: though a quick explanation is that it is about four guys who get one of their lot to play a high-stakes game of poker which he loses. Thus they must get half a million pounds with-in a few days or be slowly cut to pieces.It is a movie that I can see becoming a cult movie, it has that certain feel to it. The wit in the movie is extremely clever and the directorial techniques quite unique. This movie I would term as experimental, though such movies seem to quite often come out of Britain. America dominates the mainstream market, so other countries need to experiment with their filmmaking to compete. Britain seems to do quite a good job at it.Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is what I would term as a grunge movie. The movie has a very dusky tinge to it and it is set entirely in the East-end of London (well, I can't say for sure as I suspect Harry's Sexshop, and maybe the bar, are located in Soho), a very lower class area. Everybody in the movie are criminals and this is made obvious. Even those who are clean are only clean because they distance themselves from what is happening. None of the characters have any really redeeming qualities, nor do they get through the movie due to any amount of skill. The card player, even though he is very good, could not overcome the camera which was scanning his cards, and as such lost.This movie delves deep into the criminal underworld of London. It is an underworld where there is no love or compassion but rather people trying to outdo each other. It is a world where only the strong, the smart, and the lucky survive. In fact, only six people do survive: the four card players, and the loan-shark and his kid (not counting the father, but he knows how to keep his nose clean): everybody else winds up dead, including all of the crime lords, and through a stroke of luck, the four guys manage to keep their hands clean.Some British movies do suck, but this is not one of them. From seeing movies like this, it makes me appreciate the British Cinema a lot more. I could not say if Hong Kong Cinema and British Cinema influenced each other, but there is something that sets it apart from their American counterparts. It is also interesting to note that in the 1998 version of the British Oscars, Titanic was not mentioned once.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Four neighbourhood gangsters get in too deep,"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels is a fast paced, witty, hilarious film in where Guy Ritchie made his first big hit and showed to the world that he knew what he was about. The film starts off introducing these four guys who entrust their friend Tom (Jason Flemyng) with a hundred thousand dollars to go and play a game of cards with the local mob boss, Hatchet Harry. Little does Tom know, Hatchet Harry cheats at the game, and makes a deal with Tom saying he would front him the money to continue the round of poker, and when the cards are turned, Tom loses, and now him and his three other friends are in debt half a million pounds to one of the most fearsome mobsters in town.This film is packed full of hilarious scenes, and Guy Ritchie's notorious freeze frames voice overs help add to the film greatly. A particular scene comes to mind when right after Tom loses the game and returns to his anxious friends, the camera frame stops and a voice over narrated by Alan Ford in where he says 'If Tommy told his friends that he wished the debt was only upon himself, he'd be lying ""and then the shot begins to roll again and Tom proceeds to say, ""I wish the debt was only on me, but it ain't"" Overall the film in itself was fantastic, with a deep plot line, witty dialogue, quick cuts that Ritchie is famous for, excellent voice overs, and fantastic acting on the parts of all the characters involved. Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels will keep you laughing at the twisted humor while all the while sitting on the edge of your seat, waiting for more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Mad bad and highly entertaining!...,"Mad bad and highly entertaining, I really enjoyed this film. I particularly liked the fact that when things got particularly violent the camera wasn't pointed directly at the action. We were aware of what was going on but there was no Tarantino-esq splatter-fest. This may well have been for budgetary reasons, but I'd prefer to fill in the blanks myself anyway. The plot does get a little over-complicated in places but is all neatly resolved in the end just about. Everything from the sharp, witty dialogue to the locations was done with that kind of British style you'd never see in a Hollywood production. It always hits the mark for me!...
