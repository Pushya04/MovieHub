"Four Independent Stories of Love, Adultery and Dreams in Rome","In Rome, the America tourist Hayley (Alison Pill) meets the local Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti) on the street and soon they fall in love with each other. Hayley's parents, the psychiatrist Phyllis (Judy Davis) and the retired music producer Jerry (Woody Allen), travel to Rome to meet Michelangelo and his parents. When Jerry listens to Michelangelo's father Giancarlo (Fabio Armiliato) singing opera in the shower, he is convinced that he is a talented opera singer. But there is a problem: Giancarlo can only sing in the shower.The couple Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) and Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) travel to Rome to meet Antonio's relatives that belong to the high society. Milly goes to the hairdresser while Antonio waits for her in the room. Milly gets lost in Rome and the prostitute Anna (Penélope Cruz) mistakenly goes to Antonio's room. Out of the blue, his relatives arrive in the room and they believe Anna is Antonio's wife. Meanwhile the shy Milly meets her favorite actor Luca Salta (Antonio Albanese) and goes to his hotel room ""to discuss about movies"".One day, the middle-class clerk Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni) becomes a celebrity and is hunted by the paparazzo. A couple of days later, he is forgotten by the media.The American architect John (Alec Baldwin) travels to Rome with his wife and feels nostalgic since he lived in the city thirty years ago when he was a student. He meets the student of architecture Jack (Jesse Eisenberg), who lives on the same street that John had lived, and he invited to drink a coffee at his house. Jack lives with his girlfriend Sally (Greta Gerwig) that invites her best friend Monica (Ellen Page) to stay with them in their house. But soon Jack has a crush on Monica.""To Rome with Love"" is a romantic movie by Woody Allen with four independent stories of love, adultery and dreams in the Eternal City. The most curious is that the stories are not entwined like usually happens in this type of movie.The story of the caretaker that can only sing operas in the shower is sarcastic, with the typical humor of Woody Allen that performs a neurotic and insecure character.The story of Antonio and Milly is funny, with the sexy Penélope Cruz performing a prostitute with a perfect Italian.The story of Leopold is a joke with the present moment of the world, where mediocrity becomes famous without reason only because, for example, she is hot or he is a soccer player.The story of John is thought provoking, with a mature man returning to his youth trying to fix his own mistakes. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Para Roma, com Amor"" (""To Rome with Love"")",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Enjoyable Woody Allen Flick,"Although nowhere near Woody Allen's great films like Annie Hall, Manhattan, Hannah and her Sisters and Midnight in Paris, To Rome with Love is still a charming, and entertaining film. Some have called the film, Woody Allen's worst film, and I simply don't agree. (His worse film is Scoop) The whole cast works nicely and all the performances are all around great. My favorite being Judy Davis, she stole the show for me.I found some of the scenes rushed and haphazardly constructed and some of the dialogue overwritten and under-rehearsed. The film at times, felt very lazy and a bit fake, at times. At 112 Mimutes, To Rome with Love is a good 20 minutes longer than most Woody Allen films, and it shows. The movie was overlong and a bit boring at times. There weren't enough charming and funny scenes to compensate for it's running time. Some scenes should've definitely been cut. Woody Allen's latest effort is flawed, but definitely not a bad film, as most are saying.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Why people can't appreciate this? 7/10,"""To Rome with Love"" is a fantastic and beautiful movie by none other than Woody Allen. All of his movies are about cute, funny and complex love stories happening at the same time in one location. In this film in particular, you have four love stories happening at the same time in one of the most beautiful cities in the world. A great cast starring Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, Alec Baldwin, Roberto Benigni and Allen himself. Along with other good actors all do a great job together. We as the viewers who try to understand Allen's movies most of the time can see his elements repeating themselves again in this film such as: the love affairs amongst the characters, the long filming of the locations, the beauty of life shown that not everything can be achieved, how the characters are left with his/her loved ones, how all stories end with a closed ending, etc. Personally I always enjoy Allen's movies and kind of hoped this one wouldn't end so quickly, something about all the plot points during the movie were really compelling. When I saw on the page of the film the rating it got. I just couldn't understand why people can't appreciate Allen's movies nowadays? Is it that hard to enjoy a romance movie these days? In rome?",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"a light trifle for Woody Allen is still amusing, hit-and-miss entertainment","You kinda always know what you'll get with Woody Allen films by this point, which is that for every work that he does that knocks it out of the park (Match Point, Midnight in Paris), he'll come back and then... make a film that just stays as a single or double, to use baseball terms (i.e. Scoop, and this film). To Rome with Love is another ""Woody's European City Tour"" that follows London, Barcelona and of course Paris, and with Rome he pays tribute by doing one of those Italian anthology comedies (I haven't seen a lot of them frankly, but I'm thinking like back in the 60's with Boccaccio 62), and there are four stories that Woody could also have made individual films. Well, two would have been potentially amazing if they had the right focus (one of them, not so much, the time it has here is fine). Let's quickly rundown:Woody himself returns for the first time on screen since Scoop (a little too old to be the romantic lead anymore, aside from, say, married to Judy Davis), and he and his wife go to see their daughter, played by Allison Pill, who is set to get married to Michelangelo. His parents are simple Roman folk, the father a mortician... who is also an amazing opera singer, but the catch is that he can only sing great in the shower (don't we all?) so Woody makes a trick: have him sing in the shower - on STAGE! Alec Baldwin plays a guy who, I think, looks back on his younger self as an impressionable architect (Jesse Eisenberg, very Woody-esque surrogate, but plays his own strengths well as well) who has a new romantic interest in the super-neurotic actress Ellen Page plays (a different turn for her that I had fun watching, though intentionally annoying as a character). An Italian couple are in love and are unfortunately separated and, through wacky misunderstandings, wind up with other partners over the course of one day. And Roberto Benigni is a regular guy chased by the paparazzi. Why? Why not?Woody juggles between these stories and, the worst I can say about it is, it has an air of a sitcom to it. There's some misunderstandings and usually around fame or love or sex, or all of the above, and it's not too deep. Well, maybe the Baldwin/Eisenberg plot has some poignancy about a Man of the World who looks back on his youthful indiscretion, or would-be one, and there is a lot of humor to be mined. Hell, it's great to see Benigni have fun and be actually funny again in his premise, where he starts to go down deeper in the rabbit hole of fame. And while it's the weakest plot of all with the two Italian lovers split apart, when Penelope Cruz comes on screen for her brief time she's sexy, fun, and intelligent in her acting. Even Woody Allen himself, telling a lot of the brand of old, semi-corny jokes (but ALWAYS with a knowing wit and punchline) is amusing.But when comedy works, it works, and there's a lot of stuff that worked here for me more than it didn't. Just seeing the old Italian man singing in the shower on stage (and applying/washing off Pagliaci make- up!) is a gag that only the most cynical would turn off on. It's a master filmmaker having fun, and a jazz clarinetist (yeah, I'm going there) noodling around on his instrument in a cinematic sort of way. I think for the summer season, which has passed know, it's a fine way to spend an afternoon or evening, not to mention with a wonderful cast by older-and-young Hollywood players and Italian not-so-well-known folks. Just not in an OMG YOU MUST SEE THIS IT WILL WIN AN Oscar sort of experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The warmth of banked embers,"For most of the past decade Woody Allen has been revisiting old themes in new places. He writes a witty script, hires a good cameramen, has great actors flock to him because he writes great lines for them and directs the film efficiently. So we have travel vistas that he has even been putting the city's name in, like VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA, MIDNIGHT IN Paris and now the Fellini-esque TO ROME WITH LOVE.If you get the idea that I look down on these efforts, let me say I enjoy them very much. Mr. Allen has reached an age and ability in his craft where he can do things easily and smoothly, so that the three farces that make up this anthology set in the Eternal City offer some wonderful excuses to show off the city. My favorite is the one about Roberto Benigni, an ordinary man who suddenly finds himself a celebrity upon whom the media hang. His bewilderment is a lovely, comic performance. However, if you prefer the one about the retired record producer who makes the machetunim an opera sensation in the shower or the the one about the young temptress, that's fine too.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Allen's Most Disappointing Film from Europe,"Woody Allen's seventh postcard from Europe lacks enough postage. It should be rubber-stamped ""Return to Sender."" This is undoubtedly the most disappointing of all his films set in Europe.Following a lifetime spent channeling New York's neurotic side, creating some of the most memorable roles in modern film history (Annie Hall, Leonard Zelig, Danny Rose, and of course – Allen himself), the 76-year-old film legend abruptly departed his familiar Manhattan backdrop in 2004, taking his introspective wit across the Atlantic, initially to London, then Barcelona, followed by Paris, and now Rome.His latest release To Rome with Love has all the ingredients of yet another tasty Allen stew. But in the end, all we sample is watered-down broth, poorly seasoned, with stale recollections of the spicy flavors that made Match Point, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, and Midnight in Paris so thoroughly original and enjoyable.To be fair to Allen, he's coming off his biggest commercial success ever, which is a hard act to follow. Since his heyday as a writer-director-star during the 1970s, Allen's films haven't performed particularly well at the box office. But like summer stock theater, they tend to make just enough money to keep Allen atop the list of directors most actors long to work with. For that reason, Allen pretty much gets his pick of the litter as to who he casts in his films, and often writes characters perfectly suited to the typecasting.Indeed for Allen, the blockbuster 2011 hit Midnight in Paris was tough to match – either critically or commercially. But not only does To Rome with Love fall far short, it doesn't even belong on the same continent.The plot is very familiar territory for fans of Allen's films. Three stories are supposedly entwined, full of quirky characters, ultimately providing audiences with humor, greater understanding, and ultimately-- revelation. That was supposed to be recipe.Trouble is, this time around none of the stories Allen has penned are particularly interesting or memorable. Predictably, Allen does manage to steal one segment, playing a bored American retiree who is accompanying his wife to Italy. They are scheduled to meet their daughter's soon-to-be husband, and family. As one can imagine, the interaction between Allen and the non-English speaking Italian family has its moments. The story blossoms when Allen unexpectedly discovers the Italian father can sing like Caruso. But the high point of this operatic mini-drama becomes too forced, testing the audience's patience to say nothing of straining credibility.In the second story, Jesse Eisenberg (The Social Network) plays an American student living in Rome along with his girlfriend. When the girlfriend invites ""Monica"" to pay a visit, played wonderfully by Ellen Page (Juno), Eisenberg becomes infatuated with the new house guest and the fireworks begin. The always reliable Alec Baldwin, perfectly cast as the debonair know-it-all, oddly provides a voice of reason during Eisenberg's degenerative courtship, hoping to stop his protégé from making a complete fool of himself.The final story seems both camp and patronizing, cookie-cutting arguably the only Italian actor widely recognizable to American audiences (Roberto Benigni -- Life is Beautiful) as the warm roasting chestnut to provide some wildly-exaggerated depiction of the ""average"" Italian. This story gets old quick, and drags down what would otherwise be at least a mildly entertaining film.Italy should be perfect canon fodder for Allen's innumerable idiosyncrasies. A nation of wildly-gesturing people full of passion about everything -- art, soccer, food, whatever -- seems the perfect foil for all of Allen's self-centered New Yorkers. Instead, the opportunity is wasted. The film might as well have been shot in Cleveland.Without giving away too much, there's no payoff in the end. For audiences expecting to see the combustible explosion during the final climactic scene from Allen's vast cinematic laboratory, we are left wondering why any of this mattered.And that's the trouble – it didn't.In his masterful 47-year film career, Allen rarely delivers a product that seems so unfinished. It's as though Allen wrote a (somewhat decent) first draft, and then suddenly called in the cameras to start shooting. Allen knows very well that greatness comes through time and repetition.Like fine wine, this one needed to age a bit. It was served far too early. And like so many bad Chiantis, the tannins were overwhelming to the point of being undrinkable.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not among Allen's greats, but still a lot of fun","While not great Woody Allen – it's neither profound, moving nor funny enough for that title, it is quite enjoyable.The film is made up of four intercut short stories, that share little other than the fact they're set in Rome. Some have fantasy elements, some are more absurdist, others more straightforward character farce.But somehow, though they don't make much of a logical grouping, the whole thing is lighthearted and fun enough that it seems grumpy to pick on it.Sure some jokes fall flat and some ideas seem unfulfilled, but a lot of it is wonderfully acted and cleverly written. And at a time when so many comedies are aimed only at 15 year olds, even 2nd tier Woody, simply telling playfully comic tales, is a welcome sight.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Woody Allen sets his camera on Rome this time weaving together an anthology of stories and interjecting Rome as its own character,"We have seen Woody Allen's multiple love letters to New York City, London, Barcelona, and Paris; now he sets his satirical eye on the ancient city of Rome. Starting halfway through the previous decade, Woody Allen altered his standard oeuvre from mostly comedic farce with a dash of autobiographical drama set amongst towering New York skyscrapers to films set in major European centers where the city itself is almost its own character. Barcelona nudged its way into the love triangle of Vicky Christina Barcelona and Paris's nightclubs and streets were a central character along with Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein in Midnight in Paris. In To Rome with Love, Woody is even less subtle about his intentions by loudly proclaiming in the film's title what he is up to.There are multiple stories entering and exiting the stage with even more characters; however, unlike the majority of films which juggle numerous plot lines, these do not intersect; they exist by themselves and involve their own unique Roman characteristics. There is John (Alec Baldwin) who chooses to retrace his former life as a young man in Rome 30 years ago and ends up having a very interesting encounter with Jack (Jesse Eisenberg), Sally (Greta Gerwig), and the flippant Monica (Ellen Page). John has seen it all before and sets himself up as a Greek Chorus variant to the younger crowd. By the end of their section, every man in the audience over 30 should be nodding their heads in agreement about the Sally vs. Monica pros and cons. Their love triangle is a convenient excuse to insert the ancient ruins and architecture which you knew must fit somewhere in the film.Hayley (Alison Pill) is in her early 20s and fulfills one of the ultimate lost tourist clichés in Rome; she bumps into Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti), falls in love, and decides to spend the rest of her life in Italy. Upon hearing the news, Hayley's parents, Phyllis (Judy Davis) and Jerry (Allen), jet over to Rome to meet this guy and survey the situation. In his typical Woody Allen way, Jerry has a lot to say about the turbulence on the flight over, sizes up Michelangelo as a Communist, and can barely stand the irony that Michelangelo's father, Giancarlo (Fabio Armiliato), is an undertaker. Leave it to Woody to be able to fit his absolute phobia of death and all its accompaniments into a film about Rome. This particular film segment uses Roman opera as its backdrop with a very clever farce involving singing in the shower.The most blatant comedic segment in the film is Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni). He is just a regular working stiff who wakes up at the same time every morning, eats his toast, goes to work, engages in water cooler talk, and comes home. One day, Leopoldo starts getting chased by obsessive paparazzi and screaming autograph seekers wherever he goes who want to know what he likes on his toast, how he shaves, and whether he is a boxers or briefs man. There is no reason for his sudden fame explosion which confuses Leopoldo all the more. This also confused the old ladies sitting next to me; however, this was a brilliant way for Allen to skewer the celebrity fetish. Some people are famous for just being famous even though they have accomplished absolutely nothing.It seems Woody Allen used his most recent European love letter to fit in some messages he has had stirring around his brain for a little bit. He tackles the odd fascination with know- and do-nothing celebrities, the appeal of going after the vapid and attractive female even though you know she is ridiculous and it will only end badly, and what I suppose is a critique of not being a prude at the beginning of marriage. Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) and Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) have just arrived in Rome after their wedding to start their new life. Through a silly and contrived sequence of events which only serve to set up a ridiculous situation, Antonio winds up with a stunningly gorgeous prostitute, Anna (Penelope Cruz), and Milly winds up tempted by her most favorite actor in the world. This particular part of the film does not work too well but it does provide plenty of laughs as inappropriately clad Anna visits the Vatican.To Rome with Love is not among the top tier of Woody Allen's decade long infatuation with filming in European locales (Midnight in Paris) but it is certainly not the worst (Scoop). Weaving in and out of these disconnected plot lines is fun and most of them are quite enjoyable. Using Rome and all of its wonderful settings to tie all of his characters together easily helps out what will most likely become one of the more middle of the road and average Wood Allen pictures. However, it is worth noting than an average Woody Allen film is head and shoulders above what is playing down the street in your local multiplex right now.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A Half Cooked Italian Dish,"Rome must be one of the most photogenic cities in the world, no matter how you look at it or who is looking. The Rome of Fellini with all its magic corners or Pasolini's Rome with its poetic darkness. Woody Allen's Rome is pure postcard glitter. What a let down. This is Allen's weakest script so far. Seems undecided and downright lazy. The tribute to Fellini's ""The White Sheik"" verges on theft and the Italian actors delivering their lines in Italian look and sound as participants of a provincial amateur hour. Even Oscar winner Roberto Benigni gives a pale and tired life to a thoroughly underwritten character. Allen himself is very good as is Judy Davis as his wife. But, I wonder what was in the writer/director's mind. I believe that in Allen's filmography from best to worst, To Rome With Love will appear very near the bottom. But, let's not despair, the master is already prepping his next flick.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"All of your heart's fantasies played out in Rome with love, celebrities, death and opera","""To Rome with Love"" is a fantasy film; a comedy about people living out their fantasies. The great thing about it is that it's subtle enough that you don't recognize the fantasy element in all of the relationships until later on in the film. The obvious one is when native Roman, Leopoldo Pisanello (Roberto Benigni), becomes a celebrity over night. ""It's better to be a celebrity than an unknown."" And as Benigni shows, way funnier too.It's the type of film where everybody gets to see themselves as famous, or supremely interesting, or a guiding angel, or married to a hooker, or the object of a movie star's affections, or on a romantic rendezvous with a thief, or having the ability to change the world with one simple idea. It will take you to wherever your heart desires. And then you'll realize why it's often advised to think with your brain rather than with your heart.Half Italian and half English, we follow two relationships involving Romans and two relationships with Americans in Rome. A young, Italian, married couple get separated and the young man finds himself living out every other young man's fantasies while the young woman finds herself living out her own fantasies.Hayley (Alison Pill), a New Yorker transplanted in Rome, falls in love and gets engaged to a successful Roman lawyer. Her parents (Woody Allen and Judy Davis) make the trek across the ocean to meet their in-laws. But Allen's obsession with death and equating retirement with death causes him to create a national disaster (or success story, depending on how you look at it).Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) is an American architect living in Rome with his girlfriend. First he meets his architecture idol, John (Alec Baldwin), who sees Jack as the younger version of himself. Or more accurately, Jack sees John as the older version of himself (the joke works better that way). Then Jack meets Monica (Ellen Page) who is his girlfriend's best friend and is the object of all men's fantasies.Page also gets to play the role of the self-obsessed, pseudo-intellectual — commonly referred to as ""the pedantic one"" in most Woody Allen movies. Other than Allen himself, Eisenberg and Baldwin play a sort of tag-team version of the self-deprecating, neurotic hero, although this time with a touch of confidence.Confidence is not to be confused with optimism because as funny as ""To Rome with Love"" is, it also has Allen's usual undertone of pessimism. Death is going to come sooner than you would like, but not soon enough. And even if you do get to live out your heart's fantasies, they may not lead to everything that you hoped for. This film is the comedy version of death and negativity, and can provide you with the simple joys in life.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

a wasted opportunity,"""To Rome with Love"" is a less successful movie than ""Midnight in Paris"", which is a little masterpiece, even though it had a much more ambitious goal.Stories and characters are enjoyable (apart from Benigni, who in the end is less overacting than usual), but the flaw is in the background. Italy, as it is represented, is neither present Italy nor past, probably more similar to the one represented in the movies of the 50s or 60s .Woody Allen's movie is a sincere tribute to Rome as seen in the history of cinema. However, this 'golden age' portrait, if compared to the present, seems alienating and little plausible: he might as well have done a costume film...Some highlights are particularly appreciated though: first of all Alec Baldwin's character, then Penelope Cruz's, the ""newly-weds story"" (which was sufficient by itself to give a shade of Italian Comedy,)and finally the splendid photography. But on the other hand the movie is filled with a sensation of horror vacui that makes it a bit heavy and prolix (which is uncommon in Woody Allen).It was a pity. Knowing the outstanding results Mr Allen has achieved in portraying human troubles and tragedies, one is left with the curiosity to know how he would have managed to portray (or allude to) the tragicomic current events that Italian reality abundantly offers.But he would have needed a deeper look, which is hardly possible when one shoots two movies a year. So, instead of a big fresco portrait, the outcome is a nice little postcard.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Not the best Woody Allen but still fun,"Cartoonish with bad contrived forced acting (like a dry run-through of a script). This required a huge suspension of disbelief on the viewer's part. Why was Woody even in this? He is FAR too old to be a plausible parent - should have been the grandparent. He apparently decided to take the bold approach of having his usual stand-in little Jewish kid (Jesse Eisenberg) AND himself in the movie (some kind of existential paradox?). Having said that, I do still like Woody in his own films - but I want him off to the side as in Scoop. The only actors who were good were Roberto Benigni (outstanding), Alec Baldwin, Penélope Cruz, and Greta Gerwig. Also, Fabio Armiliato is a fantastic singer,Here Woody Allen takes his own invented genre to its own cartoonist extreme. We, the viewers, are supposed to suspend all sense of reality to accept this. This is the new genre of Woody Allen totally using a city as a crutch to support any contrivance of a plot and script. It is like each actor is doing a Woody Allen imitation (are they that intimidated by his presence???). He also relies on his tired formula of having several unrelated story lines intertwined.If you drop your critical eye and just enjoy this movie, it is entertaining. Actually the brilliant Roberto Benigni makes this movie on his own. He is hilarious. Penelope Cruz is also a lot of fun.p.s. I can't believe that reviewer Grey Gardens called Scoop Woody Allen's worst film! I loved that movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A Real Disappointment,"When I saw that a new Woody Allen film was out entitled To Rome With Love, I was thrilled, both because I usually enjoy his films, and because I am going to Rome for the first time in a couple of months. Well, what a letdown it was. Presenting the stories of a few couples and/or families and friends, the film seemed to be an attempt at Woody's usual m.o.'s, i.e., comedy, and his philosophical takes and questions on the things that matter to him, mainly male/female relationships, art/creativity, and life/death. While most of his films succeed in conveying both comic and philosophic perspectives on these issues, To Rome With Love did not. It came off as being a superficial, lightweight attempt at all of the above. In my opinion, some of the humor bordered on slapstick, and much of the script was predictable. I'm sorry to have to say all this as I was hoping for so much more. Maybe the next one will happen. Oh, and BTW, I think Woody should give up acting. At least in this film, he added nothing, and perhaps, detracted from it. The character he plays is hackneyed, worn out, and predictable. Better to have someone else play him, as in Midnight in Paris, which was so wonderful.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A movie for fans,"As time passes Woody Allen is able to transform himself and his movies. Don't get me wrong, it is obvious that we are seeing a Woody Allen film from the initial credits, but he still can surprise us.We see different stories through out the film. Some show aspects of the Italian lifestyle and culture, presented from a beautiful Rome; that city that Allen wants to present to us, his Rome. But other stories present again the issues that have been important to him, those problems that for centuries have raised for humankind: love, infidelity, death, success, fame, happiness; those issues that Allen simply loves to discuss.The cast is charming and I want to highlight a sincere Roberto Benigni; Jesse Eisenberg, that resembles perfectly the young Woody Allen; and the beautiful and talented Ellen Page, with a powerful character that makes you impossible not to fall in love with her.I have the huge bias of been a Woody Allen fan and that is probably why I enjoyed so much this movie. It is thrilling to see him acting again. See all that neurosis again in the big screen. This movie surprises, can be as surreal as Buñuel would be and also as real as Allen is with daily problematics.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Pointless is an understatement,"I am a fan of Woodie Allen, even if I didn't always like all his movies (but I have many favorites). Even in movies I didn't enjoy I understood the point - ""To Rome with Love"" HAS NO POINT. The acting at times is bad, the stories are incoherent and the script surprisingly feels written by a 9 year old child... Something I never expected from a Woodie Allen movie.I left the theater feeling I had undergone a social experiment by someone who wanted to see, after the success of ""Midnight in Paris"", if someone would stand up and shout ""The king is naked!"".Of the 4 parallel story lines only 1 was somewhat watchable and that's because of Alec Baldwin, and even that storyline started so incoherently that it was hard to enjoy it for the rest of the movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
This film is OK,"This film is mildly amusing and yet contains some glimmers of the old Allen comic genius about it. I found it somewhat charming and overall not too bad. You won't be wetting yourself with laughter but it is 'a painting'of some charm nonetheless.The film centres on the life/love stories of several folk in Rome hence the title 'Love Letters to Rome' all of which vary in their comedic factor.Hats off to Penelope Cruz because her performance was outstanding and surprisingly good - she was very comical and great at speaking Italian. I think she stole the film in fact. Not so much the other stars, including Allen himself, largely down to the subdued material.To go into more depth would bore the pants off anyone with a sane mind. Out of ten? A generous score is a 6 simply because it is an Allen and if feeling harsh, a bare five.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"From ""To Rome With Love"", to ""To Woody, With Hate""...","Woody Allen has always been enamored with Europe and Europe has always repaid him well in return. Nothing extraordinary with Allen's European appeal since he's always been influenced by Bergman and Fellini, both emotional and intellectual school of film-making approaching the things of life, with Allen's humor to spice it all. In result; there has always been a love story between Woody and Europe. ""To Rome With Love"" only states what we've known already and on the scale of the many masterpieces that paid heartfelt tribute to Allen's European heritage, it's a minor offering.Besides, ""To Rome With Love"" was released six years ago which on the scale of Hollywood history and the major upheavals following the Weinstein's scandal, are an eternity, the end of 2017 shook up Hollywood like no other year did and the tectonic resonance of the MeToo and TimeUp movement finally reached Woody Allen. Recently, many stars who starred in his movies expressed their regrets and validated their apologies with donations to the concerned organizations, Chalamet did it right after starring in the next Allen film. Colin Firth regretted working with Allen, so did Greta Gerwig and Ellen Page who both starred in ""To Rome With Love"".I was just complaining that Allen might have lost his touch after the dreadful ""Café Society"" but I'm afraid that it would be now the least of his concerns. The director who feared the Weinstein scandal would turn into a witch hunt seemed to have indirectly prophesized the very crumble of his legacy, at a time where media outrage is more vocal than court judgments. It seems that stars believed the best option is to believe the allegations against Allen, whether they're right or wrong is beside the point, career-wise, it's the right move. So, I'm not sure how we can exactly judge ""To Rome With Love"" with today's scope, the film seems like a relatively feeble attempt to resurrect the charm of his more glorious decades while not totally devoid of hilarious moments. I wish I could love the film more, but it seems so futile by now, like an exercise in Allenisms with actors trying to play the game while not totally in it... or am I influenced by their late statements?Anyway, there is a moment where a retired opera director played by Allen discovers a man who can only sings perfectly under the shower, I don't know if it's intended to be a tribute to the classic Looney Tunes' cartoon ""One Froggy Eveneing"" but only in an Allen movie, you could have an opera scene where a man sings Pagliachi with an incongruous shower set on stage. It was so nonsensical and yet predictable that it could almost be strung with the most surrealist Allen's moments and enough to earn this film two extra points of rating. If only the other parts were as good.One of them involve Jesse Eisenberg falling in love with a young student who seems to know exactly what to say to arouse him sexually, she's played by Ellen Page. Alec Baldwin is in every scene, like a not so imaginary friend, for the record, he's the only one who didn't backstab Allen yet. A second story involves a family misunderstanding between a man who must present his fiancée to his uptight family but must save face by pretending it's the luscious prostitute played by Penelope Cruz, meanwhile his fiancée lives another adventure involving a sexy burglar and has been actor. And the fourth is about an average clerk played by Roberto Benigni who suddenly becomes a celebrity without any reason.And it's very telling when the part that obviously tries to ""make a statement"" about celebrity ends up being the least successful one. The film is never as funny as when it goes to the zaniest direction and never as boring as when it tries to say something. There are many questions raised in these short films, but only the lighthearted moments allow the film to elevate itself above its heavy contrivances. Rome is such a big presence that it doesn't take much to make a film about it, but Allen overplays the postcard homage for no reason at all, granted it was part of his European tour, but Allen have proven to be a heir to Fellini with his ""Radio Days"" and ""Stardust Memories"".Indeed, there's always been something Italian without the need to go all ""Mamma Mia"" without it... no pun intended of course.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Hackneyed,"Hollywood should stop Woody Allen producing movies if he is to recycle his genres over and over and over again.'To Rome With Love' is a clichéd Woody Allen piece with his hackneyed signatures like multi-layered love stories, couples that came together due to accidents and a babbling, irritating Woody Allen in whichever boring roles he wrote for himself - that last bit has not changed a bit since Annie Hall and man, that was over 30 years ago.While the film has moments of brilliance, the odd but banal plot does not save the day: Alec Baldwin's part was cheesy and awkward, and one wonders why his younger companions were not annoyed by his presence; what happened to Benigni was left unexplained - in a way it needs no explanation but it sounds ridiculous from the beginning - leaving one feeling somewhat disconnected to the story. In fact, all the stories are not connected, but it is not like Paris Je T'aime where the audience knows it contains unrelated stories. At times, I feel that Woody Allen was trying to make the stories stick together but failed. The incoherence has created such distance between the plot and the audience that the whole film looks like nothing more than a showcase of brilliant actors whose only job was to be beautiful in Rome.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Woody is back!,"To Rome with Love (2012) was written and directed by Woody Allen. In this movie Allen does for Rome what he has already done for New York and Paris--transformed the city into a magical kingdom where anything is possible.The film doesn't have one plot, it has four. It doesn't have one star, it has about a dozen.The four plots involve a young small-town Italian couple who arrive in Rome right after their marriage; a retired opera director (Allen) and his wife who come to Rome to join their daughter, who has fallen in love with a young Italian lawyer; a famous architect (Alec Baldwin) who interposes himself into the life of a young U.S. architecture student living in Rome; and an ordinary citizen (Roberto Benigni) who overnight inexplicably finds himself a major celebrity.Things I learned about Woody Allen from this film: he hasn't lost his touch as a director; he hasn't lost his touch as an actor, as long as he can play Woody Allen; he hasn't lost the ability to write some of the funniest lines you'll ever hear in a movie.Other things I learned: filling a movie with beautiful women--Ellen Page, Alessandra Mastronardi, Penélope Cruz--is generally a very good idea; Penélope Cruz was born to play an extremely sought-after high-class prostitute.My wife and I enjoyed this film, and it was clear that other people in the theater liked it as well. Question: why is it rated 6.3 by the IMDb voters? Here's another case--see my review of ""First Position""--where I wonder if the voters who gave it a 6 saw the same movie that I saw.""To Rome with Love"" is a funny, intelligent film with great acting and great views of Rome. See it and decide for yourself whether it deserves a 6.3 or a 9.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
From Woody With Wit,"To Rome With Love isn't as intoxicating or as unanimously pleasing as his previous effort, Midnight in Paris, but it does provide us with some joyously, aesthetically pleasing escapism to warrant a recommendation. Allen is seventy-six years old, and still has quicker timing than many directors attempting to channel him and has been churning out a film nearly every year since 1969. With prolific qualities come some lesser works, but the film isn't lesser as much as collectively adequate.With that phrase, I mean the film, as a whole, knows what it wants to do, is fully consumed in that idea, and sets off to accomplish its task. It has itself together. Yet, despite a rather respectable effort, it doesn't work on every level or ones that it necessarily should. The story is composed of four vignettes, none of which finding cutesy ways to intertwine with one another (probably the best option), and is complimented by an ensemble cast.One of the first stories centers around Hayley (Alison Pill), who is visiting Rome and falls in love at first sight with Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti). She quickly decides she wants to live with him in Italy, and her parents, Phyllis (Judy Davis) and Jerry (Woody Allen), fly straight over to meet him. Allen's Jerry scores big laughs at every turn, as he complains about the turbulence on the plane, his disdain for pleasure in places, and his immediate write-off of Michelangelo that he is a Communist. Jerry soon discovers that the man's father (Fabio Armiliato, a real life opera singer) has a profound voice, but is self-conscious, untapped, and can only perfect his singing in the shower. This generates the offbeat qualities that only Allen himself can play with a straight face.Another centers around Jesse Eisenberg's Jack, a studying architect who bumps into famed architect, John, played by Alec Baldwin. Baldwin knows what it feels like to be in Jack's shoes, and he discovers that Jack is dating Sally (Greta Gerwig) and seems to have his life under control. In walks her friend Monica (Ellen Page), and despite her pseudo-intellectual vibe and her overly detailed sex history, Jack begins to fall in love with her, and refuses to take the warning sings from John.The two others follow Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) and Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi), a newlywed couple residing in Rome, when through a series of rather silly and uninspired events, lands Antonio in bed with a gorgeously voluptuous prostitute named Anna (Penélope Cruz), who he must now pass off as his wife, Milly, while the real Milly is being smitten by her favorite actor. The setup is corny, but provides for a nice farce and some chuckles along the way. The weakest story is oddly the one with the most ambition, and it revolves around the seemingly normal Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni), who is just a regular Joe with a regular wife and two kids. Out of nowhere, in the blink of an eye, he becomes famous and renowned for the simple things he does every day, like shaving and sleeping on his back. While the vignette is clearly synonymous with the fact at how so many undeserving people are ""famous"" for doing things that are unworthy of recognition and just being themselves, the comedic value is tiresome, the satire is there at the same time it isn't, and Benigni himself becomes rather uninspired as time goes on.The cast works wonders together, mainly Eisenberg and Page who create a likable chemistry and spark untold possibilities from the start. But the scene-stealer from the first frame is Woody Allen, who returns to the acting position after six years. His presence here immediately sparks for some delightfully awkward interactions with his family, as well as some ""you either get it or you don't"" jokes that Allen seems able to produce effortlessly.Rome is projected through a lens of credible elegance and warmth, not to mention a true respect for the culture and the character it possesses. To Rome With Love adds to Allen's ongoing European travelogue, and while it certainly isn't his strongest efforts, his lovable vibes are still visible through the sea of sheer craft.Starring: Woody Allen, Alec Baldwin, Roberto Benigni, Penélope Cruz, Judy Davis, Jesse Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig, and Ellen Page. Directed by: Woody Allen.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Rome....where a wrong turn can open up a new wonderful experience.,"I loved this movie for a bunch of reasons. The first being that the wonderful location (Rome) brought me back to a city that I first visited just shy of a year ago. And now I'm sad that I'm not there. Secondly it made me absolutely laugh out loud, many times throughout watching it. Thirdly, you either love Woody Allen's sense of humour or you hate it. I have always been on the loving side of the coin...it's sort of like whether you are a Monty Python fan or not! People try and read too much into stuff, and just allow yourself to sit back and enjoy it. I'm not an English major or a graduate of film studies; but this is a really an incredible movie on so many levels, subjects, characters, location, feelings, it is all there. I personally love when Woody puts himself into his own movies because it adds that element to the film that otherwise would be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"A minor Allen film, but still very enjoyable.","With a film being made every year, Woody Allen's career has highs and lows. 2011's Midnight in Paris and 2013's Blue Jasmine are his two highest points in many years. In between is To Rome with Love. Unlike the other two films, it's pretty minor overall, although it's still a very funny comedy.The film tells four different stories, all unconnected to each other. Some are stronger than others, although each has it's interesting points. The highlight is a love triangle involving Jesse Eisenberg and Ellen Page, with Alec Baldwin as an all seeing commentator. This might have even worked as a film on it's own, and is in the same vein as many of Allen's romance tales.The other entries include a husband and wife who find themselves wrapped up in other people, a man who suddenly becomes famous for no reason at (the weakest entry of the bunch) and a young couple's parents meeting for the first time (with Allen playing one of the parents, his first role since 2006).Allen's story in particular contains a very funny conclusion that seems right out of his sillier early 70s movies. Plenty of great one liners and comedic situations pop in all the stories overall. This isn't one of Allen's films that explores anything deeply or carries a big message, but provides a lot of laughs. And that alone makes it worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Un-researched Cliché,"This is a disappointing movie by Woody. It makes a very superficial analysis of the Italian society, which is described as totally frivolous, uninteresting and where women are driven by sexual curiosity rather than principals.Some aspects of the Italian society, such as the veneration for celebrity and the roman high society should have developed more, instead Woody just glanced over without any reflection.Overall the movie was totally commonplace, funny only rarely, and overall bad bad acting; only actor which was slightly amusing was Benigni, who was described as ""typical Roman"" in the introduction but spoke the whole movie with a Tuscan accent!! another example of Woody's superficiality in researching the movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
A Charming Gem; Too Bad People Are Comparing It to Other Films,"To Rome with Love (2012)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Woody Allen's latest features another all-star cast including the likes of Allen himself, Judy Davis, Roberto Benigni, Alison Pill, Alec Baldwin, Greta Gerwig, Alessandra Mastronardi, Jesse Eisenberg, Penelope Cruz and Ellen Page. The film basically tells the different stories of unrelated characters spending the summer in Rome. One story involves a father and mother (Allen, Davis) going to visit their future in-laws and Allen discovering that the father is a singing genius. Another deals with a young man (Eisenberg) who is falling in love with his girlfriend's (Gerwig) best friend (Page). Another deals with a young newlywed couple (Alessandro Tiberian, Mastronardi) who find themselves involved with other people. Finally, an ordinary and rather boring man (Benigni) wakes up one morning and is forced to be a celebrity for no other reason than he's a celebrity. It's really a shame that TO ROME WITH LOVE seems to be getting attacked not for being a bad movie but instead of it just not being as good as MIDNIGHT TO Paris. Since that film really shot Allen back to the top I guess it should have been expected that some might leave this disappointed because it's not as good as the other but it's a real shame because this film deserves its own spotlight.There's no major surprises or laugh-out-loud moments but the picture is just one charming moment after another and I really don't think the smile ever left my face. I think it's fair to say that none of the characters or their situations would have made for a good feature on their own but with everything cut down to basically four different movies, I think the actors bring the parts to life enough to where it really works in this Robert Altman like set up. I think Allen's dialogue is really on the mark as he once again spins that web of romance, mystery of life and of course his various opinions on certain subjects. It seems Allen is having the most fun with the Benigni character as there are many shots at people who are famous for no reason other than being famous. The way Allen gets his point across is extremely well done and it really makes you see how silly it all is. I'd say that all four stories work very well and there's no question that the casting was perfect. Allen is in fine form, a bit slower than in the past but this is to be expected. Baldwin is extremely good doing his best work in years as a person who just shows up to give advice. Both Eisenberg and Page deliver fine performances as does Gerwig. Benigni is a real delight in his part as the ordinary man who gets to experience fame. Cruz is a major standout as a hooker who gets mistaken for a man's wife. I must say that I've never seen her looking more beautiful and it's that one thing more striking that the Rome visuals. TO ROME WITH LOVE is fast, funny but mostly it's an amazingly charming little picture. It's not Allen's best but it's rather amazing how this guy can pump out at least a film a year.",,Anonymous,Music
Pleasant lightweight fare.,"To Rome with love is a perfectly agreeable comedy ,which although it wont change your life will provide an entertaining couple of hours.Tipping it's hat to the European portmanteau films of the nineteen sixties its four separate stories all take either a fantastical or absurd turn and the lives of it's characters are turned upside down. After an unsure start the film settles into a consistently amusing tone which occasionally moves up a gear into the very funny .The stories themselves are quite slight,no more than extended gags in some cases and given the light tone of the film this is perfectly acceptable,however as the film has an almost two hour running time i felt that perhaps ten or fifteen minutes could have been pruned to maintain the light atmosphere.I'm sure also that natives of Rome would take issue with the authenticity of the portrayal of life in that particular city!It's obviously the film of an older writer director and as such probably wont connect as readily with younger audiences,but a pleasant experience never the less and it's sunny ambiance makes it a tonic on dark wintry evenings.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Spotty But Worth It,"Of the four disconnected story lines of 2RWL, the plot with the newlywed couple, the hooker and the movie star was completely dispensable, the plot with the shower singer was recycled early Allen shtick that could have been a sketch from Without Feathers 45 years ago, but the plot with Benigni's schmuck becoming a celebrity was enjoyable (and I never thought I'd want to see Benigni in anything ever again).The film is worth seeing for the plot with Baldwin, Eisenberg and Page -- a good, cynical, mildly malicious meditation on the truth that the only real male erogenous zone is the ego. Page has the guts to play a thoroughly dislikable character with real zest, and Baldwin glides gracefully as the voice of rueful experience. Like an icon that shows a saint simultaneously at several stages of being, Baldwin is at once Eisenberg's real older contemporary, the inner voice of his better judgment, the omniscient narrator and the older, successful Eisenberg looking back on the young idiot he was.Allen loves the theme of getting away with something -- murder in Crimes and Misdemeanors, Bullets over Broadway and Match Point, infidelity in Hanna and Her Sisters and Vicky Cristina. 2RWL has not one but three never detected infidelities, not to mention Benigni's more or less open dalliances that his bemused wife simply accepts as the perks of his bizarre celebrity.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Woody Allen's worst movie ever ?,"Woody Allen's worst movie ever? Quite possibly and after some recent hits this one makes me wonder whether age has finally caught up with Woody Allen, who is now 76 and who, by judging from this film, may be well past delivering an even passably enjoyable movie.What a sad waste of an opportunity to enjoy the marvels of a fantastic city like Rome and its wonderful people and culture. The plot attempts to weave three stories, with quirky characters involved with the magic of this city, through to something for the audience to enjoy. Sadly it is a complete flop. There are basically only three jokes in the whole movie that get relentlessly tortured over and over until they have you squirming in your seat waiting for the movie to end. Not the least bit funny or amusing, and they become increasingly boring.What a sad waste of a competent cast including Alec Baldwin, Judy Davis, Roberto Benigni (from ""Life is Beautiful"") Penelope Cruz, and Ellen Page etc. The only joy for me in this film was the brief time that Penelope Cruz spends on the screen; she at least marvelously delivers her small part as only she can, despite everything else dragging this movie down.The role for Roberto Benigni's character is terrible; a simply ridiculous and distracting annoyance throughout the film.The ending of the film was simply underwhelming.This film had all the right ingredients, like some of Woody Allen's other European based movies, so why did it turn out so badly ? Hard to say exactly why, but obviously the buck must stop with Writer/Director Woody Allen.A waste of two hours of my life that I will never get back.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Woody Allen as always a great, witty and in his fine creative form. I have been very glad to see his on a screen and his performance with Judy Davis was one of the most funny in that beautiful movie.

Solid dialogs.The actors. A star studded cast with nice results. I'll just name a few here: Penélope Cruz, Ellen Page, Jesse Eisenberg, Alec Baldwin, and Roberto Benigni.The bad. Nothing.The ugly.

"Amusing Update of Fellini's ""White Sheik""","TO ROME WITH LOVE is a portmanteau film paying more than a passing homage to Fellini's 1952 classic WHITE SHEIK. The plot concerning the the young married couple Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) and Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) visiting the city for the first time and becoming separated has been directly borrowed from the earlier film. Antonio has an elaborate program of events, including a visit to the Vatican as well as an encounter with elderly relatives; once Milly has disappeared, he does not know what to do until hooker Anna (Penelope Cruz) agrees to play the role of his wife. Meanwhile Milly meets her favorite movie actor Luca Salta (Antonio Albanese) and almost goes to bed with him. This is perhaps the best part of Allen's film: the other plots, while being mildly entertaining, are largely unmemorable, save for the farcical sight of Giancarlo (Fabio Armilato) singing on stage in an opera production staged by Jerry (Woody Allen) while showering himself at the same time. There is a perfectly logical explanation for this: Giancarlo can only reveal his true vocal talent in the shower, so the shower has to be constructed wherever he appears, even if it is in the middle of an opera house. TO ROME WITH LOVE makes some familiar points about Rome's peculiar fascination; its history, its color and its capacity to charm most of its residents, as well as tourists. Darius Khondji's lush cinematography, with its soft reds, blues and yellows, reinforces that impression. In this kind of world, people should just relax and accept whatever happens to them: triumph and disappointment should be treated equally. Middle-aged architect John (Alec Baldwin) learned that lesson long ago; his younger counterpart Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) realizes the same thing when his itinerant girlfriend Monica (Ellen Page) leaves at very short notice for Los Angeles. After a triumphant debut at the opera house, Giancarlo opts for a life of happy domesticity, while Jerry returns to a life of retirement. TO ROME WITH LOVE might be a slight piece, but it is filmed and performed with a considerable degree of élan, and is well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Not One Of Woody Allen's Successes,"Woody Allen movies seem to always be either a hit or a miss. This particular film didn't even rise to the miss category. It was predictable and dull. There were a few funny lines, which all happened to be Woody's, but even those were few and far between. Woody's last effort, Midnight in Paris, was a delight, pure perfection. This one, however, is so forgettable as to be not worth bothering with. I will say I enjoyed Alec Baldwin's part, but that wasn't nearly enough to carry the movie. It was clear how Allen wanted to have the mix all come together and easy to see what he was striving for with each episode.but none of it really worked. Over-acted and under-written. I would say skip this one and wait for Woody's next film. Odds are it will be a hit.or at least something better than this one.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

It mostly involves around the life of a celebrity, an architect, an opera and a married couple and a mom and dad who've come to visit their daughter Hayley(Alison Pill). Along the way strange relationships and interactions are formed as each is still trying to discover his or her self. Alec Baldwin is a okay as John an actor who once lived in Rome and Penelope Cruz is ravishing as a high class international call girl.

"Far from Allen's best, but undeniably entertaining","'To Rome, with Love' is pretty darn close to a mess. Even those who very much like the movie (including me) should admit that. Yet, it's also hilarious and one of the most entertaining films of 2012. The odds are, you will see half a dozen films this year better than 'To Rome, with Love', but you won't enjoy them as much, and/or they won't be as much fun. It honestly had the potential almost to be a B-movie, except it wasn't actually bad.I wished that the stories had intertwined a little bit more. Having Jesse Eisenberg's character meet Woody Allen's character would've been great. The problem with non-intertwining stories is, difficult it becomes to put yourself in the lives of all these different characters. Sometimes, it felt like I was only watching the people instead of actually being able to put myself in their shoes. That said, some of the stories require treatment like that.Take the ""paparazzi story"" as an example, where a worker suddenly finds himself famous. I thought this premise was brilliant; but at the same time, the execution was overlong...we get it. Satire on how someone doing everyday things will get in the paper as long as they're a household name...but that's mostly all we get every time Allen decides to switch back to this guy's story. However, I will say that the scene with his wife's torn stockings being mentioned on the red carpet is downright hilarious.I liked the story with Woody, and it was nice to see him acting in his own film, which he hasn't done since 'Scoop'. It was a bit silly, but still creative. I'd say that one has the greatest one-liners (""you're figuring that in Euros, in American Dollars it's much less""). It has a jesting, visual style of humor that worked well.The story with Penelope Cruz had a subtle and well-executed twist near the end, and it was mildly funny but not as much as the one with Allen's acting. I felt that the Jesse Eisenberg story was very stylish, despite being another one where you felt like you were just watching them.Overall, I'd say that 'To Rome, with Love' is guaranteed to be one of the most enjoyable films of the year, even though it has very little cohesiveness; none of the stories are really expansive enough for a feature-length film. At times, certain elements are silly and borderline implausible, yet the film stays fresh with great cinematography and visuals of Rome, as well as sufficient comedy. Nearly a mess, but a surprisingly charming one at that.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The Bloom is Off the Rose,"""To Rome with Love"" comes off as a series of short stories written by a middle school student, lacking any logic and possessing the sexual maturity of a thirteen year old boy. Employing the ""bigger is better"" approach, Woody Allen takes the device he used in the far more successful ""Midnight in Paris"" of a nebbish character swept up in an unexplained fantasy and cranks out a series of nonsensical vignettes depicting nebbish characters in unexplained fantasies, replacing the impressive vistas of Paris for the impressive vistas of Rome. There are a few laughs along the way, but Allen spreads himself so thin that he is unable to provide his universe with any depth or reality and tries to get by on the audience's familiarity with his work and the faded idea that whatever he puts on screen represents quality.The most successful episode features Alec Baldwin as a world-weary architect who makes a sentimental journey to the street he lived on as a student and encounters young Jesse Eisenberg now in residence and living out a romantic entanglement that Baldwin pops in and out of to provide jaded insight. This sequence at least offers some actual emotion for the audience to connect with (largely due to the fine acting of Baldwin, Eisenberg and Ellen Page as a sexy but neurotic actress steeped in Allen's signature pseudo intellectuality) but is so confused about Baldwin's presence that the audience is unclear if he is simply the person he is presented as, if Eisenberg is his younger self who he has come back to mentor, or if it is some bizarre ""Twilight Zone"" scenario that is never fully resolved. Even when he is in the room with the characters Eisenberg is interacting with, no one makes any reference to Baldwin and no one except Eisenberg can seem to hear what Baldwin is saying (the few times when the other characters do respond to Baldwin only make it more confusing when they don't). Yet this peculiar relationship is never explained and seems a product of Allen's sloppy writing rather than mysterious forces at work.The rest of the vignettes are just lazy, implausible nonsense whose outrageousness is forced and seems planted there to make up for any genuine wit. The most tiresome sequence is Roberto Begnini as a mundane worker bee who inexplicably wakes up to find himself the most famous man in the world. It's a one-joke premise that goes on for far too long, and since Begnini's boring drone doesn't get any more interesting as a result of what he's experienced, neither does the story. A young couple on their honeymoon are parted just as they are about to meet some people who are important to their future, and the husband implausibly substitutes prostitute Penélope Cruz for his absent wife. The newlyweds end up throwing aside the marriage vows that they just took in an alarming display of Allen's sexual immaturity. And Allen himself makes an appearance as a frustrated opera director who discovers a major talent who can only show off his gifts in the shower, in yet another one-joke misfire.It is sad that after a long stretch of sub-par work and redeeming himself with some quality films like ""Midnight in Paris"" and ""Match Point"" that Allen is content to present a lazy effort like ""To Rome with Love"" which is so derivative of his ""early, funny films"" without any of the freshness or inventiveness. If you're looking for something to do this weekend, I recommend popping ""Annie Hall"" into the DVD player and giving this one a pass.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Very good Woody,"While certainly not the best of WOODY ALLENS films, it's better than most. There are four story lines which do not link. That's part of its strength. Nice to see a film where the Italians speak Italian (sub titles make it more realistic). This is a definite must-see if one is a WOODY ALLEN fan. Even if you're not, there is something very enjoyable about it. Implausible to say the least, but that's what makes it so much fun. Time elements are all over the place, and logic must take a 'back seat' if you're going to enjoy this clever movie. Not as clever as MIDNIGHT IN Paris, but clever in its own terms. Everyone will have a favorite segment. Mine is the one in which WOODY actually appears. His daughters future father-in-law is a great opera singer...IN THE SHOWER. Woody makes note of this and his shower taking is incorporated into the story. Must be seen to be appreciated. The ALEC BALDWIN/JESSE ESINBERG segment is a bit confusing, but fun. Poor Jesse. That poor guy. He's no actor. He delivers the SAME PERFORMANCE IN EVERY FILM. He has an acting range from A to B!!!! PENELPE CRUZ, on the other hand, really makes her segment come alive and one wishes there were more of her. She's featured in the newlywed segment. The weakest segment is the one with that Italian actor who won an Academy Award years ago, Roberto Bergini. While he does fine with the material, the story seems a little forced and too long. Although the scene at a movie premier with his wife is hysterical when the press is commenting on the wife's apparel.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Carry On Woody,"A sophisticated Carry On romp? Which may mean more to UK readers? Others outline the plot and actors etc. and this is for those who want an opinion of, if to watch it or not. I say yes, Woody's in top form here.It was all going on here at an active pace, with bedroom farce and gags coming thick and fast. Sure, it's not plausible (neither were Marx Brothers films) but that didn't matter to me, I was laughing out aloud in an empty room, which is usually a good sign of a good movie.I remember when people used to say something like ""Where's the old Woody Allen, when he used to be funny?"" well here he is. He's used the backdrop of Rome and his love of Italian movies to hang his usual incisive observations, absurdity and irreverence, all combined with his comedic skills as a performer and writer. There really are some great lines and visual gags.A small example: there is one scene where Roberto Benigni, catapulted into celebrity status, is caught by the papparazi (a familiar theme in films about Rome) with a pretty woman, who is not his wife, and runs off to seek refuge and runs directly into a Church Procession, which blocks his escape. A nice touch I thought.Woody Allen must have the pick of talent from where ever he wants, and he has certainly chosen wisely with a rich array of actors, all going along for the craziness. Rome is the backdrop and is looking good.If you want the finer detail about the film read others worthy reviews (I can't understand the bad ones of course), but if you want an opinion as to if you should watch, then I thought it's up there with Woody Allen's best, but may not be high art, just great fun. Go along with it and you just may enjoy the ride.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
brilliant and with an impressive opening scene,"After his acclaimed ""Midnight In Paris"", Woody Allen chooses the location of the the eternal city and directs ""To Rome With Love"", a story about a number of people in Italy, some of them American, some others Italian, some others residents or visitors, and the romances/adventures/predicaments they are all involved in. Woody Allen, Alec Baldwin, Roberto Benigni, Penelope Cruz, Judy Davis, Jesse Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig and Ellen Page stars in this comedic ode. The location is wonderful of course and style not far from the usual Allen, it makes laugh but frankly doesn't add to much to his filmography.

Terrible.,"Woody Allen's latest is terrible. His hackneyed movies about white people used to have epiphanies and the characters grew- Long Long Ago. Paris was weak and shallow but brilliant in its construction. Modern movie-making demands more character development, more substance, more significance. The acting in this is so wooden by all but the true Europeans, the self-discoveries so shallow, the premise so weak that it was difficult to watch. Even Rome is not shown in it's best light.

"funny, free and imaginative but doesn't amount to much","Throughout his career, Woody Allen has managed to portray the details of human relationships of almost any kind, combined with a sense of dry humor, intellectual references with a personal touch.. going through 4 uneven, unrelated stories placed in the beautiful city of Rome, Woody Allen, the master of repartee (how awesome it is to see him still able to deadpan a line like none other), manages to create an intelligent film, plunging his characters into a world of art and knowledge. under the seal of comedy, Allen brings up the absurdity and silliness of love, relationships, adultery and fame. and despite the weakness of the two stories starring Roberto Benigni and Penelope Cruz, Woody Allen cleverly plays on the perception of roles. however, the lack of cohesion in the stories and the themes prevent the viewer from being hooked, and they ultimately feel like snippets of stories which Allen has already told in previous movies. also, Rome here could be anywhere else; Allen failed to capture the essence of the place, nor the best-case scenario as he did with Paris, London and Barcelona, let alone the odes he has devoted to New York.. It remains true that To Rome with Love is a funny, free and imaginative movie but, like Benigni's character's fame, it's only fleeting and doesn't amount to much",6.0,Anonymous,Music
My least favorite of his from the six ones I've watched,"I've watched six films by Woody Allen. The first five (in the order of time I watched them) are Annie Hall, Hannah and Her Sisters, Manhattan, Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Midnight in Paris. I watched this one today. I have to say this is the one that lacked in creativity the most. Some characters' storyline was dealt fast and abruptly. It was absurd sometimes.I did read about the critics this movie got but I went to it anyway because it was Woody Allen and he was acting in it so I wanted to see it a little more. The movie is not that bad, I know there light clichés and weak story lines but there is also the pure Woody Allen cinema we know in it.If you wanna see the master's latest work, go see it. Don't let a 54 Metacritic point and bad reviews hold you. It's not as good as last year's Midnight in Paris (which I call ""a beautiful and sweet masterpiece"") but it's not disaster, either. My points is 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Can't decide,"Same age as Woody. From same neighborhood. Great, nah. Enjoyable, okay. But on this one, can't decide beyond that level. Being decisive and indecisive, being experienced or inexperienced, seem to be underlying themes, with subterfuges by the characters to be neither or both.First Woody Allen movie where I found his music choices lazy, I mean, Domenico Modugno's tired ""Volare"" to vamp us in? Come ON, man!Worth seeing for the outstanding performances of young actors Allison Pill 27 and Ellen Page 25 though as I recall they did zero scenes together. Ellen and Allison / Page and Pill. Love to see Woody write a 3-act story, for film, for the two to solo in, maybe add Alan Rickman as Greek chorus, as Alex Baldwin was in this one.As to this movie, some hit-n-run philosophical points made, and Woody finally recreated his orgasmotron, at least metaphorically, which suggests he's got some slapstick left in him. Though it was not nearly as funny.Stay tuned. 77 ain't nuthin'. Ask me. Per IMDb, his next effort is back in NooYawk to which I say, 'bout time!Next day I had this added thought. That since these three or four (?) separate stories are not connected, perhaps they had accrued in Woody's notebook over time as individual unplaced items, and he finally found a way to incorporate them into one structure. Possible? And perfectly legit as creative process if they work in that context.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Beyond simply bad - it's irritating,"Hope springs eternal. You see his name on a movie. You think back nostalgically to ""Annie Hall"". You ignore how much you hated his last movie. You try to be optimistic that this will be better. You think the movie can't be worse than the last. But it always is. Woody Allen becomes more irritating with each new movie: the bumbling persona that hasn't been funny for 25 years , the pretentiousness, the pseudo-intellectual fantasy mumbo jumbo, etc etc. wore out their welcome long ago. And yet he persists in making yet another version of the last movie he made. He never grows. He never changes.I've reprogrammed by DVD zip control.

Filmaking,"It is always easy to dismiss real things as not important. Writing real things do not make them surely understood. You need to be in somebody's shoes or pen to imagine what the words were meant to mean. 1+1 adds to two anythings. But we make abstraction our normal way of seeing things. I am not a Woody Allen fan but I see the real Woody in this film. Expressing the absurd is hard if you want to make sense. 'life is cruel at times and does not fulfill your needs' Rome is an eternal city that is witnessing our short sight. We do not appreciate the effort of our ancestors to leave a testimonial for future generations to pick up. We simply do not understand that saying things once should be enough. We keep on making the same mistakes over and over walking over the signs left for us to notice. Italians are just easier to point out because they shout about it, they are just loud.

With age comes wisdom. John: With age comes exhaustion.,"Woody Allen is best known for playing neurotic New Yorkers for decades. Here, he plays a retired opera conductor whose daughter has relocated to Rome, Italy. Woody Allen has written, directed, acted and produced an all star cast with Alec Baldwin, Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, Judy Davis and Allison Pill in the cast. The film is centered around Roman landmarks like the Trevi Fountain and Piazza Navona. The stories don't intermingle. Davis and Allen played a retired couple visiting their daughter and make a discovery in the shower. Alec Baldwin guides Jesse Eisenberg through a love triangle during his stay. Roberto Benigni and Penelope Cruz also star in this film. There are some scenes done completely in Italian with subtitles. Woody Allen wanted to pay homage to the great Italian film directors like Fellini and others in this film.

"Both too much and not enough the same as ""Midnight in Paris""","Woody Allen's latest film, ""To Rome With Love"", may be a companion piece to his wonderful ""Midnight in Paris"", having a style and approach similar to the earlier Oscar-winner. Unfortunately, in Rome we're bogged down by four unrelated stories with characters that are charming, but mostly never explored to their full potential. And with many of the scenes taking place indoors, I never found myself being transported to the titular city as I was so completely with ""Midnight"". I will give props to Alec Baldwin, Penelope Cruz, and Ellen Page for some fine acting and comedic timing, and double-props to Woody for still being able to dead-pan like no other. I hate to compare films, but when your opening title sequence uses the same style and font as the last one you made, can you expect me not to? This one could have been great, but its production value and style suggested it may have been rushed.-Thomas Bond, TheFilmDiscussion.com",4.0,Anonymous,Music
To Rome With Love...3 out of 4 Skittles,"In true Woody Allen comedic fashion, To Rome With Love intertwines different stories into one larger piece with the title city set as the background. Some of the story lines are good...some not so much.The best story arc stars Alec Baldwin playing an architect visiting the city to retrace his steps from thirty years ago when he lived in Rome as a young student. Baldwin runs into his younger self, played with usual neuroticism by Jesse Eisenberg, and follows him through an affair he had with his girlfriend's best friend (played by Ellen Page). The entertaining and amusing story line could have easily been made into a feature length story of its own.Roberto Benigni stars in what is probably the least entertaining story line as a man with a boring office job doing the same thing everyday who wakes up as a famous celebrity for no apparent reason. The idea is beaten over the audience's head and quickly loses traction. It's one that I wished Allen would have scraped from the story all together.Even with some of the slower moments To Rome With Love is light and fun, and will entertain Woody Allen fans. It doesn't dive in as deep as some of his other recent flicks, but for Allen, who continues to pump out at least one movie a year, it keeps the train rolling.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"To Rome with Love (2012) - Rome, Dear Rome!","Writer-director Woody Allen not only continues to make a movie almost every year, but also continues his European exploration genre of films with his latest movie, ""To Rome with Love"", which even though it didn't have the same taste and wonder found in ""Midnight in Paris"" or ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"", it's still a decent and enjoyable motion picture from Woody Allen. Set as an ensemble motion picture, ""To Rome with Love"" follows the paths of different story lines, all going back and forth with one another. There are so many story lines, that it's kind of difficult to keep up with them, all in one time. You seem to forget one storyline, then it leads to another, and then you go back to the one you forgot about, and you realize that it was still in the movie to begin with. But at least Woody Allen peppers those story lines with great performances, great writing, and good precision. Even if the movie kind of felt too long in the process. In one storyline, Jesse Eisenberg suddenly falls for his girlfriend's exotic best friend, played by Ellen Page, while the hilarious Alec Baldwin tries to persuade Eisenberg that it just might not work. Also, the very iconic Roberto Benigni returns on the screen, who becomes famous for no exact reason. Penelope Cruz stars in her second film with Allen, as she plays a prostitute who has been asked to fill in as a lawyer's wife. Then, there's the one and only Woody Allen in a very hilarious performance as the wise, fast-talking, and often awkward man who tries to take the father of his daughter's fiancée, and turn him into a great opera star. Some stories are entertaining, while others just flat-out don't even matter. I will say that I was a little disappointed by this movie, but at least I wasn't overall. I still seemed to enjoy the experience of that movie. The writing is top-notch, the acting is brilliant, the sights of Rome look beautiful this time of year, and the music is just gorgeous. But there's really not a lot of something else to make this movie brilliant. This movie still had something missing, which I wasn't found impressed by. Even though ""To Rome with Love"" isn't one of Woody Allen's finest masterpieces in a while, I will say it's perhaps a rather decent one! ""To Rome with Love"", in my review, ""earnest and decent, but nothing remarkable"".",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"To Woody, with great love from the movie-loving world, bellissimo!","In Rome, there are lots of folks on the verge of great love. There is the young American tourist (Alison Pill) who just happens to get directions to the Trevi fountain from a gorgeous young Italian lawyer. Soon, they are seeing the city and having dinner. But, the idyllic phase may be over when her parents (Judy Davis and Woody Allen) fly in from the States to meet the young man and his family. The lawyer's father, a mortician, sings opera in the shower well but fails to make an impact when he has no soap in his hands. Then, there is a young architectural student (Jesse Eisenberg) who has a live-in girlfriend (Greta Gerwig) he supposedly is much in love with. What a curveball when her longtime, struggling-actress pal (Ellen Page) shows up to turn his attentions in a new direction. An older building designer (Alec Baldwin) is around to give him advice. There is also the gentle clerk (Roberto Benigni) who suddenly captures the world's attention, even to what kind of underwear he sports! And, what about the young married couple, straight from the country, who come to Rome for a new, wealthier life and get tangled up with a call girl (Penelope Cruz) and a philandering actor? What doings and what romance is in the air! Dear Woody, don't be scared, but I am a number one fan, among many in the world. Therefore, every work you create is like adding a new element to the periodic table. This one is fresh, funny, clever, and utterly gorgeous in its photography. The cast, very large, is also terrific!

Woody Allen's Love Affair With Europe Continues In This Disjointed Mess Of A Motion Picture,"Not amongst Woody Allen's finest works but still exhibiting some charm, fun & delight of an Allen film, To Rome with Love is a collection of four story lines that are totally unrelated to each other that deals with themes of adultery, fame, fantasy & other stuffs and while it lacks the element of surprise, it still makes up for a pleasant, light-hearted entertainment.The story of To Rome with Love follows four intertwined but unrelated narratives. The first is about a clerk who wakes up one day to find himself a national celebrity. The second follows an architect who's reminiscing his student years in the streets of Rome. The third concerns a young couple who are on their honeymoon, and the last one is about a girl's parents who arrive in Italy to meet the family of her fiancé.Written & directed by Woody Allen, To Rome with Love continues the esteemed filmmaker's love affair with European cities and finds him photographing Rome & all its rich beauty in a colourful manner. The plot looks as if Allen came up with four different ideas for a story set in Rome and decided to include all of them into one without offering any connection whatsoever which turns the whole experience into a wonderment for what exactly was his purpose here.These quadruple snippets aren't compelling either for the different plots just unfold without any sense of direction or any sort of interconnection. Cinematography is a real highlight for the camera gorgeously captures the lush wonders of Rome, made all the more beautiful by its exquisite use of colour palette & bright lighting. The film also offers some laughs over the course of its runtime but none of its amusing moments stays around once the end credits start rolling.Coming to the performances, the movie features a star-studded ensemble in Woody Allen, Alec Baldwin, Roberto Benigni, Penélope Cruz, Judy Davis, Jesse Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig & Ellen Page and although none of them leave a lasting impression, the sum of parts isn't all too shabby. But it's not the actors who are to be blamed since their scripted characters doesn't have any meat on them. Also, a few of them actually try to make up for that shortcoming by chipping in with some effort that never quite pays off.On an overall scale, To Rome with Love sounds like one of those flicks that was crafted just as an excuse to make something in the city of Rome. It sure qualifies as a wonderful ode to this attractive European destination but the story is a disappointment, even if there are few laughs to be had in between, plus every character inhabiting it only feels incomplete in one way or another. Frustrating at times but never really boring, To Rome with Love is funny in little doses plus has its moments but as a whole, it lacks the inventiveness of Woody Allen's best works.",,Anonymous,Music
When in Rome...,"A slight, fitfully amusing collection of thematically linked but otherwise unconnected vignettes, all taking place in Rome. The highlights were the casting of Judy Davis, the perfect Woody actress; the story of the mortician who would rival Domingo, if allowed to sing in the shower; and the city of Rome itself, which is pretty damned gorgeous. Most of the segments are intermittently amusing, but more than anything else this reads like a collection of Woody's prose, brought to screen, which he accomplished with much greater success in DECONSTRUCTING HARRY. Altogether, a good reason to avoid 4th of July lunacy, but certainly not a great film.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Four compressed versions of Allen's other movies,"The four unrelated plots that compose this mess of a movie focus on classic Allen's themes he tackled better many times before.The plot featuring Benigni is a compressed version of ""Celebrity"", the Allen movie about the absurdity of contemporary fame-worshipping. Benigni is a most overrated actor/director with a very limited range. His scenes are painful to watch.The story featuring Eisenberg, Gerwig and Page is the standard Allen's fodder of a young man falling for a neurotic/pretentious/unreliable female, in the past the classic Keaton's role. In ""Anything Else"" Christina Ricci played the Page role. This story is also annoying and the dialogues bad and repetitive. Comments fly around about how sexy and irresistible the Page character is supposed to be, even if she does not strike me as such...A third story features a young Italian couple acting as if they lived in the 50s. They both are ludicrous but manage to cuckold each other given the first chance. The ""wise"" hooker played by Cruz is straight out of ""Deconstructing Harry"".The fourth plot was for me the most unbearable, featuring Allen himself at his most Allenish. Stammering, afraid of death and involved in a stupid plan (see ""Small Time Crooks"" and many others), Allen manages to concurrently insult Italian families and operas.Even the soundtrack is atrocious, with some corny Italian tunes from the 50s. The only saving grace is the photography. However, the real Rome is a mess of ugly buildings and traffic, not the golden collection of monuments showed in the movieReally an awful mess that should be voted in the negative.... even without mentioning the overbearing product-placement.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
ironic and funny,"well, since ea few years I started enjoying Woody Allen movies and so I wanted to watch this one as well. And it was definitely worth it!

I like young Alessandra Mastronardi, know in Italy for many TV movies, well, she is great there, so with her a good future.The movie is ironic, I enjoyed the part of Roberto Benigni the most, as it's a critic towards show business in my opinion.The other stories were also entertaining.What I was puzzled to see was a microphone that was visible in some scenes... Is it really possible that such a mistake can be made by Woody Allen??Ah, and great to see Rome in a movie, fantastic town.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"I do not love ""To Rome with Love"", even though its not a ""To Rome with Hate"" for me","I loved Woody Allen's Paris, but was definitely disappointed with Woody Allen's Rome. For the most part, ""To Rome with Love"" lacked creativity, inventiveness, and appeal. Unlike Woody's wondrous ""Midnight in Paris"" which was both a love letter to a divine city and also a captivating narrative, ""To Rome With Love"" was just simply the former and lacking the latter. Now, I did enjoy some facets of ""To Rome with Love"" but like my personal European trips, they were far and few in between. Woody seemed rushed in constructing the movie, it was like he was trying to build Rome in one day. The film features several story lines set in the titular city, some with natives and some with tourists. We start the Rome adventure with a trip to Haley's Comet, which would be the young American Haley who travels to Rome in an excursion. Haley falls in love with the Italian Michelangelo (no, not that Michelangelo, this is not ""Midnight in Rome"") and therefore since it is a romance in the most romantic city in the world, they get engaged. Haley's American parents Jerry and Phyllis visit Rome to meet Michelangelo and his parents. Jerry is played by none other than Woody himself, and Phyllis is portrayed by Judy Davis. Jerry, who is a retired Opera Director, notices that Michelangelo's dad has a brilliant opera singing voice when he hears him singing in the shower; so therefore Jerry decides to try to ride that ticket to a return to Opera glory even though Michelangelo and his mother are totally against it. Let's just say this storyline was not showered with magnetism. It was great to see Davis in an Allen film again, being a veteran of so many Woodyflicks. And Woody was just being Woody with another neurosis-filled performance. Allison Pill turned out a solid performance as Haley. I want to say so much on the promise of Allison's acting career, but I decided to take a chill pill and move on to our next stop in our Rome film review excursion. That would include the beautiful return of Roberto Benigni (remember him?) as the Italian family man Leopoldo who obtains instant stardom when he inadvertently becomes a Reality Star phenomenon, and gets plummeted with press observing every move he makes during the day. Allen is obviously depicting the unauthentic aspects of Reality Show fame, but the joke starts wearing thin at times even though Benigni portrays it with precision. Moving right along to our next Rome storyline, there is a story that was prostituted for cheesy laughs. And that would be of a young Italian married couple Antonio and Milly who visit Rome to meet Antonio's uncles but a series of events lead Antonio and Milly to separate Romeatic adventures including Antonio having a bombshell Italian prostitute named Anna pretend that she is his wife for reasons that would take too much time and energy to explain. Besides that, the story was not funny; but Penelope Cruz did look ravishing even though her performance was overacted and not even in the same ball park as her Oscar-winning performance in Allen's ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"". And our last stop in ""To Rome with Love"" was the most entertaining narrative of the movie. It includes Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, Greta Gerwig, and Alec Baldwin. Eisenberg plays Jack, an architect student living abroad in Rome with his American girlfriend Sally, that girl is portrayed by Gerwig. Jack meets the effervescent middle-aged John (Alec Baldwin), who when he was Jack's age also studied architecture in Rome. John becomes like a guiding force and voice of reason or unreason to Jack by giving him advice on a dilemma that occurs when Sally's best friend Monica (Ellen Page) visits Jack and Sally. Monica is cerebral, analytical, and chatty which are all attributes that attract Jack to her. So where they be a ménage a trios as the Romans do?, o wait that is the French. Baldwin nailed the John performance, and is worthy enough of a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Ellen Page has just turned another page in her impressive young acting career with another fine-tuned performance. I do have to credit Allen for scribing a very witty screenplay within this storyline, but this is the only one that did it for me. Allen does show breathtaking scenes of Rome that brilliantly captures the beauty and romance of the beloved city, but that was not even enough for me to unanimously recommend this movie. ""To Rome with Love"" is not a total disaster, and it does have numerous good things in it, but if I were you I would not spend too many Romeing charges on it. *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Fragmented and disappointing,"I recently watched Midnight in Paris and really enjoyed the light whimsy of it and how effective it was, so as a result I continued to watch To Rome with Love – the most recent of Allen's films to be greeting with cries of ""return to form"" only for the film to generally be less well received soon afterwards. I had hoped this impression would not be the reality in the way Paris wasn't, but sadly it was. The film opens in busy Rome with many people coming and going and plenty of stories – a young married couple gets separated, two sets of parents come together to meet each other but inadvertently change the career path of both, an older man walks the streets and finds a younger man whose situation he recognizes and a perfectly normal man suddenly finds himself the focus of an adoring press.Amongst all these ideas are some nice ones and some less so ones. The film runs long (for Allen) trying to fit them in and it gives the whole film the feel of a fragmented sketch show where no one thing is done well enough to carry the weaker moments. I did enjoy aspects of most sections but generally I found myself underwhelmed with how they were delivered. The older man/younger man thread is a nice one but it seems stiff and lacking spark and inspiration. Allen himself as actor overdoes it and seems out of place a little – which is a shame to see, but the rest of the cast are mixed. Some are natural, some are ""acting"", some are fun and some are not. It is a very mixed bag and again one that doesn't totally come together. Visually it is very appealing but I found the style a little bit fake and forced – perhaps I felt this as I have only been to Italy a handful of times and maybe don't have the same experience I do in France? Don't know but for some reason I didn't find too much of it to be charming which I guess was the hope.A shame; forgiving Allen fans will find some enjoyment in it, and it is not without its good aspects, but generally I found it fragmented and disappointing, lacking the charm it really needed to have.",,Anonymous,Music
This Movie Encapsulates All Previous Works,"The movie is a good introduction for anyone seeing a Woody Allen film for the first time. Set in Rome Italy, the movie consists of several mini-stories, each with varying timelines. It is a must for any college student writing a thesis on Woody Allen films. The film summarizes all his prior works with a few exceptions like 'Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" and is good for making comparisons and contrasts. For those who have seen three or more Woody Allen films the movie is a good vehicle for the writer to present some memorable dialogue in his usual humorous style, however it cycles through all his prior concepts with little new to offer. Because of the humor I therefore gave the film six stars versus five. Mr. Allen the writer may benefit from collaborating with someone new to infuse future movies he so masterfully directs with an innovative storyline.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

A curious but endearing film.,"Diane and I watched Allen's film this afternoon in Fremantle and although we agree on virtually every film we see, To Rome With Love is the exception that proves the rule. I did not mind the film, in fact, I thought that its quirkiness was very endearing and I enjoyed the afternoon's viewing but then I enjoy Woody Allen more than Diane does. She found the whole business of New York Americans swanning around Rome too hard to take but I just found the movie too peppered with great actors to dislike the film.People probably already know that the film is segmented into a number of parts; two of which are Italian and two are about American visitors to Rome. They are in the Eternal City for differing reasons and the substance of the film concerns the individual episodes of their life with the beauty of Rome as the background. Because of the vignettes it is easy to have likes and dislikes about each of them but to me the glue holding them together was the quirkiness to Allen's script. I suppose love could be singled out as the movie's theme but this theme (if it is such) becomes so stretched that it morphs into a high school essay topic.As one would expect with this calibre of actors at work the professionalism is constantly on display. The script, because the Master wrote it, is also of a high calibre even if the twists and turns might cause you to pause on this matter. Take the film as it is and do not wrestle with it too much; it is a very entertaining film and certainly deserves an afternoon or evening of your time in viewing it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Decent homage to the city of Rome,"To me ""To Rome with Love"" is a movie full of perceptions. It is a Woody Allen's tribute to the city in which Fellini and Marcello Mastroianni created their masterpiece ""La Dolce Vita"". Roberto Benigni character fully represents that with paparazzi chasing him around asking the most banal questions and hanging tight on each - even more banal - answer. In a way it is a reflection of our society and its obsession with celebrities; about how our vain we are and what happens to those celebrities suddenly taken out of the public spotlight (Lindsay Lohen meltdown anyone?) as our interests evaporate while we shift our attention elsewhere to another meaningless ""famous"" person...It is also an older Woody Allen's funny perception of women (Alec Baldwin character); with display of what he portrays to be their cunningness compared to what he might have consider to be ""romanticism"" in his younger years. I said it was ""funny"" because I'm a guy so as you can see ladies I'm clearly biased :)Finally you find some laughs as well in the character being played by Woody Allen himself and his dealings with Italian family his daughter is getting married into.The movie by no means reaches the heights of ""Midnight in Paris"" but it is not (as some others have claimed) the worst movie Allen's ever made. It is a solid effort in a tough task of paying a homage to the city of Rome.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Treading Water,"After Woody Allen's surprisingly deft script for 'Midnight in Paris' many had high hopes for 'To Rome With Love' despite its title indicating a retread. Well, a retread would have been more welcome than this meandering, unformed, and undisciplined collection of predictable vignettes.I won't belabor the mini-plots as a few hundred people have done that already. I'll just point out that a couple of them--starring Roberto Benigni and Fabio Armiliato--are themselves belabored well past the threshold of intolerance. Why? Because each vignette has just one joke behind it and could have been entertaining for five minutes. Not twenty. (At least Armiliato does have a good singing voice.)Allen, as he never tires of reminding us, adheres to Nietzsche's 'Great Man' theory, wherein mere mortals should hope at most to bask in reflected glory of the Superman, never to question him. And the Superman never follows the rules which apply to lesser mortals. But someone needs to tell Mr Konigsberg that his jokes are inevitably overextended and many fall completely flat. Alas, like most self-styled supermen he appears to have no one around who dares to be honest with him.Even Woody's visual tribute to 'Roma La Bellissima' falls somewhat flat despite the visual pr0n on display. He consistently selects locales which would have been clichéd and tiresome to an American tourist in 1960. Spanish Steps? Are you serious? I wonder if he knows the city at all.The film (as so many of his are) is actually a more transparent paean to adultery. In Woody's world, cheating on your lover is a productive, life-affirming, transformative act which improves your life in almost every way. Even your betrayed partner will be delighted at the new you! Woody? This is called self-justification, and you never tire of it. If only the rest of us could say the same.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Run, don't walk to see this film","If you are looking for a highly entertaining, tears-producing funny diversion for a couple of hours, Run!, don't walk to your nearest theater. It is a profound mystery to me what might have been wrong, in the reviewer's lives on the day they wrote their piece, for them to have written so negatively, or at best so begrudging with their faintest of praise. Alec Baldwin, as a modern Greek chorus (used previously by Allen), is perfectly cast as the jaded but wise Cassandra. And Roberto Benigni again proves his Oscar-worthiness in his role of Everyman-Nobody. One just can't ask for a more enjoyable movie experience. This is certainly another instance where reviewers' dyspeptic pieces can be safely ignored.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Woddy Allen just can't stop...,"The movie has the Woody Allen trademark.It makes one think, how or what it is to be like him.From his witty jokes to his wacky expression woody has clearly proved to remain the best of bests.He is completely out of box!!The movie is paced fast and tends to overlook the other aspects of the movie(which is in a way predictable).The stories are properly crafted. The movie concentrates more on the visual aspects of Rome,the nature of the characters involved,the story line and dialogs involved.The screenplay is amazing and is refreshing..As far as acting is concerned, woody is at his best.(his expressions, body language are out of the world)Alec Baldwin gives his best(especially his one liners)Jesse Eisenberg does really well..On the whole Woody Allen has definitely brought in life to the characters in the movie...None goes unnoticed..The movie isn't one of his best,but its definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
No favoritism for Woody,"In order to do a honest review, we have to show no favoritism. And if this was a love letter to Rome, it was nothing more than a tourist postcard.The storyline with Woody Allen is passable. I hated the boyfriend. Making him so annoying was a mistake. Woody had a few good lines but he was the only highlight.Penélope Cruz is another who's alone in her storyline. She had no help. The guy is doing a nervous Woody and doing it badly. The girl is naive, and separated from the other half of their storyline.Did anybody find the Roberto Benigni storyline funny? At best, it was cute, but it was never funny.Jesse Eisenberg's storyline actually had some fun especially with commentator Alec Baldwin. Although, I thought Ellen Page had absolutely no chemistry with Jesse. I get the story was for Jesse to go against the grain. But Jesse and Greta Gerwig share so many of the same mannerism. It just works so much better with Greta.Everywhere there were problems.... and tourists... both distracting.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Ozymandias Melancholia with Charm,"Woody Allen's TO ROME WITH LOVE weaves together four separate stories set in the Eternal City. Story one stars Roberto Benigni as a clerk who suddenly and for no reason becomes famous. The paparazzi follow him everywhere, fawning over ever word, desperate for a quote on any subject at all. And as soon as he becomes used to the fame and adulation, they dump him for a man walking down the street. As in STARDUST MEMORIES, this is Woody's musing on the stupidity of the fame culture. Story two has Jesse Eisenberg as an architecture student living with dumpy Greta Gerwig. When her friend (Ellen Page) comes to Rome, he becomes infatuated with her. Alec Baldwin plays an older version of Eisenberg remembering this bittersweet and youthful love, trying to inject some common sense into his younger self. Good luck. Love flies out the window when Page rushes back to the US for an acting part.Story three involves some country rubes from Pordenone who are excited to move to Rome. When the wife goes out to book a banquet hall she gets lost and falls in with a movie crew, leading to an affair with a great Italian star. Meanwhile, a hooker (Penelope Cruz) enters the husband's hotel room by mistake. When his relatives barge in, they pretend she is the wife. The rubes learn about love. Story four has Woody Allen and Judy Davis visiting Rome after his retirement as a small-time producer. Their daughter (Alison Pill) is engaged to a local and when Woody hears the guy's father singing in the shower, he sets out to make him an opera star. Problem is, he can only sing in the shower.Charming and wistful but not a laugh riot. The film earned nearly $74M worldwide and the Roman locales are beautifully filmed. The best line may belong to Woody when he opines to wife Davis about singing in the shower: ""In life I have a terrible voice, but when I'm soaping myself under hot water, I sound just like Eartha Kitt.""",,Anonymous,Music
Laughing Around the Trevi Fountain,"In ""To Rome With Love"" Woody Allen weaves 4 story lines around our obsession with celebrities. It's not captivating like last year's ""Midnight In Paris"" but it's Woody Allen so it's smart, funny and a nice piece of entertainment that should please most people. And the charming Roman scenery doesn't hurt either. Allen appears in one segment as a guy who isn't comfortable with his future son-in-law's leftist views. He's also a talent agent who can't resist one more shot at making a star despite the bizarre lengths he's forced to go through to bring it to fruition. Alec Baldwin has a nice turn as a successful architect who becomes a mentor and adviser to Jesse Eisenberg who falls for an out-of-work actress (Ellen Page) who may only see him as a temporary diversion between acting gigs. Roberto Benigni is delightful as a clerk who awakens one day to the relentless pursuit of reporters and paparazzi hanging on his every syllable. Finally there's a couple that get separated and end up in farcical situations involving a prostitute wonderfully played by Penelope Cruz and an Italian film star (Antonio Albanese).",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Woody Allen's  worst movie ever.,"To Rome with Love is just a bluff, the work of a man who's probably tired, or even worse, of a man who doesn't have anything else to say. This is the first impression when watching this movie, which lacks all the nice dialogues that are always part of Allen filmography. The characters are also just poor, and so is the acting, only exceptions are Alec Baldwin and Penelope Cruz. The story is just not interesting at all, so as the portrait of Rome, which seems so fake and untrue. Even a TV Italian commercial has a better direction (and much better photography) than this horrible movie. I mean, you are making a movie about Rome, not about Cleveland (with all respect for the city in Ohio. My idea is that Woody Allen just kept taking naps and left everything in the hands of some unknown Italian director, only this might explain this result.A huge disappointment in every way you look at it.Save your money!",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Poor Woody,"There is a facet of Woody I quite enjoy, which I denominate Perky Woody, in which he is absolutely genius. From the intense drama and suspense of ""Match Point"", to the neurosis of ""Annie Hall"", ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" and ""Deconstructing Harry"". In this category also applies the fantasy of ""Midnight in Paris"" and the limitless joy of ""Small Time Crooks"".On the other hand, there is the facet of Woody I quite detest, in this case Poor Woody. The stupidity of ""Anything Else"", ""Whatever Works"" and ""You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger"" are beyond belief. Unfortunately ""To Rome With Love"" falls into this category. Even though not as terrible as the titles I mentioned, the film falls short in almost every aspect.I believe Woody is spectacular when focused on a specific group of characters from start to finish. His study of character is unparalleled. In this case, without a subject to focus on, it seems the film was directed by Garry Marshall, in a New Year's Eve / Valentine's Day approach. Not as bad though.I didn't feel exactly compelled by any of the stories - even Penelope, charming as ever, couldn't save the shallowness of her storyline. Some will say that he created a great farce, but for me, it just didn't work.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

It's a step back from the eccentric characters of Vicky Cristina Barcelona and the delightful Midnight in Paris. However, this is a very watchable and fully enjoyable movie for the summer. I promise you'll break a laugh or two.Watching this movie I could feel Woody Allen is at a very fulfilling phase. After his disturbed, yet immensely creative work with his NY movies, he has gone off to his period in Europe, where he seems to be having the time of his life. I can only imagine the relaxed atmosphere in a set working with remarkable Roberto Benigni, luscious Penelope Cruz, and the ever cynical Alec Baldwin.Bring a positive mindset, remember low expectations are the path to happiness, and let yourself be entertained for 90 minutes.

Little Italy,"This film is not recommended.In Woody Allen 44th movie, aptly titled To Rome with Love, four stories try to become one whole film, with sporadic success. The film lacks cohesion, with some light romantic tales intermixed with stories of pure slapstick and farce. Occasionally the writer / director hits his stride, but the laughs seem infrequent and the comic rhythms never merge. This is minor Allen, but at least, he gets to travel.During his prolific career as director / writer, Mr. Allen continues to try a hit-or-miss approach to his personal independent films. The filmmaker seems more concerned with the jokey punchlines and convoluted plot devices than creating any genuine depth or pathos with his characters and their circumstances. It's as if the director was at odds with the writer and neither would compromise their own point of view, sacrificing the final product.After his witty and highly entertaining Oscar-winning film, Midnight in Paris, the Woodsman sets sail to another European location to create cinematic situations that deal with fame, infidelity, young love, unbridled passion, past regrets, and any flaw that makes us human. This setting is Roma, where love and sex delight and confuse its inhabitants on a regular basis.The film is a dizzying mélange of the Eternal City, a giddy travelogue to this country and its most popular tourist destinations. It doesn't overstay its welcome, due to the fine ensemble cast, although, in one particular segment, it does come darn close. Still one enjoys the visit, but a return trip is highly unlikely.To Rome with Love tells its several tales of romantic entanglements and tribulations in four separate vignettes, all dealing with surreal flights of fancy, the illusion of love and the disillusion of relationships, and the inability to escape our unwanted desires. For that reason, I decided to grade each episode individually, resulting in a final average:Story 1: Jesse Eisenberg is Jack, a happily engaged young man who meets his fiancée's neurotic best friend, Monica ( Ellen Page ). Of course, the more time Jack invests with Monica, the more intrigued he becomes. Enters Alec Baldwin as John, an architect who may or may not be a figment of Jack's imagination. John may be is an older version of Jack, but he mainly serves the story as its narrative conscience, bantering witty asides, as he tries to avert this liaison with disastrous results.Comment: By far, the best of the lot, although Baldwin's character becomes an enigma throughout most of the film. This episode entertains with its clever plotting and funny conversations. Perhaps if this small slice of Little Italiana were expanded and the script slightly revamped, this vignette could have made a more interesting film on its own. GRADE: BStory 2 : A newlywed couple, Milly and Antonio ( Alessandro Tiberi and Allesandra Mastronardi ) are honeymooning in Rome. Both lovers are momentarily separated and later charmed and seduced by Millie's favorite actor ( a miscast Altonio Albanese ), and in Antonio's case, a prostitute with, ( what else? ) a heart of gold named Anna ( Penelope Cruz ). Complications ensue with disastrous results.Comment: Partly successful, this portion uses a convoluted plot structure to interweave its stories about the two separated lovers. Cruz and Tiberi have a nice chemistry and the dialog here is smart. Unfortunately, the story derails as it detours the characters into sit- com situations that have no real payoff. GRADE: B-Story 3: Woody Allen is Jerry, an opera director who is married to the sardonic Phyllis ( Judy Davis ). This husband and wife team have come to Italy to visit their daughter, Hayley ( Alison Pill ) who is about to marry a handsome Italian named Michelangelo ( Flavio Parenti ). While Jerry mulls over his soon-to-be son-in-law with the usual one-liners and deprecating humor that is Allen's trademark, he meets Michelangelo's father, Giancarlo ( Fabio Armiliato ) a common man, and overhears him singing in an uncommonly melodious voice. Jerry is completely enamored of this vocal gift and wants to arrange for an operatic debut. One small glitch: that voice only projects in the shower. Jerry tries to find a solution to this problem with disastrous results.Comment: A one joke premise that runs aground very quickly. Silly and inane, the characters never amount to anything remotely real and the premise is a bore. Only Judy Davis survives in this tedious story. GRADE: CStory 4 : Roberto Benigni plays Leopoldo, a comic ordinary everyman who suddenly finds fame and fortune. He tries to cope with the world of celebrity worship since he no longer has any private moments for himself. Oh the price of fame! Hounded by paparazzi and fans, Leopoldo longs for the simple life as he tries to elude all of its fancy trappings and temptations with disastrous results.Comment: Quite disappointing, easily the runt of the pack. Allen ponders the concept of fame and creates a surreal and sanctimonious look at celebrities and their pampered lifestyle, concluding, not surprisingly, that an idol's life is not that idyllic. Most of the slapstick and dialog falls flat in its heavy-handed predictability. GRADE: C-Photographed by Darius Khondji, the film has an ugly dingy yellowed tint to many of its scenes which does little to enhance this beautiful city's allure. The non-editing by Alisa Lepseiter is clunky and quite choppy. None of the scenes even try to flow with one another, creating an abrupt and jarring effect.Overall, To Rome with Love never gels as one solid film, either in its script or in its filmmaking.

not Allen's best,"I must say this is not my favorite Woody Allen movie.Every work is different of course but is very weak, especially compared to match point which I think is a masterpiece.  Also Vicky, Cristina! Barcelona was an epic movie showing how Allen has always been ahead of his time.  Funny enough he, himself plays in from Rome with Love, exactly as an artist (in opera production business).You can still see that your watching a Woody Allen movie.  It's his quirkiness, unexpected twists, parallel stories...  It's all the elements characteristic to his style- what it lacks is the dire shock!  Think ending of the match point,  the intense encounters of Vicky, Cristina, Barcelona.  There is nothing as remarkable as these scenes in his latest movie. Maybe it didn't have to have. It's a love story at the end of the day- at least three to be more precise. Well you can't be precise though. Everyone who watches this movie will have a separate interpretations of the stories.There are the obvious relationships and their not so honest extrapolations but there are also sub stories of loving and fake admirations towards celebrities, there is also the stories of the love between son and father, love towards art and architecture, love towards work- love of life at the end of the day.Hmm when I look at at like this, maybe this wasn't a bad movie after all.  Ok it  gets a 7 from me.Enjoy the movie, Gorkem",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Yet another adultery film,"What's up with Woody Allen and adultery?His 'romantic' films don't end up being romantic, but cheap excuses for him to portray adultery as something that just happens. I bet every single one of his films starts with a not so happy couple and ends with one of them or both cheating on each other. And he makes it seem so natural, as if it's just bound to happen and everyone does it, yet no one feels bad for it. I understand cheating is very common and sometimes makes a film interesting but I've come to believe he is obsessed with the deed...and it bores the hell out of me.Also, his romantic partner, spouse, mistress in his films is always 20+ years younger than him...always.Is that a coincidence, too?

I thought it was one of Allen's best,"Yes, we've all seen Woody Allen films and know from the outset that they contain several intertwined stories that are distinct yet inextricably linked, and this one was no different. However, the distinction here is the element of fantasy that is involved in each of these stories, which has become increasing central to Allen's films of late, e.g., Midnight in Paris, the stories just seem so much more interesting than I seem to recall in some of his other films. Most noteworthy about this film is the score. It is so beautifully and aptly played throughout that it seems to almost be a narrator of the movie, as it gently guides the viewer from scene to scene. The fantastic score also gives the movie an extra element of rhythm both literally and figuratively in that it keeps things quite upbeat. The acting was very well done, with the exception of Ellen Page, which was not really her fault, because she was simply not well cast for her role. Overall, this movie was great! I thought it was one of Allen's best in quite some time.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"OK, but","Woody Allen portrays a reality of the very rich, where resources, money and time are endless even for young people (who have for instance plenty of wine bottles at disposal). Life is an adventure without serious problems and people only need to think what to do and think. On top of that, adultery is perhaps seen too much as an innocent game. I gave the stars to the story which is at least well paced, a bit cliché too but also ""cinema"" which means dreaming and caricature but above all for the beautiful images of the city of Rome which for me is really (as a tourist) the most beautiful city in the world. I enjoyed the movie, but, on marriage, fidelity and values, I was left with the feeling of listening to the wrong teacher.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Woody Allen with a European flavor,"¨If something is too good to be true, you can bet it's not.¨ Woody Allen has been directing at least one movie every single year for the past thirty years. It was Rome's turn for 2012 and although it isn't as good as his previous film, Midnight in Paris, which won Allen his fourth Oscar for original screenplay, this was still a well written comedy. I laughed really hard at several scenes and enjoyed the film from start to finish. The only problem I had with the film was that the editing was a little choppy in some scenes and the soundtrack was a little annoying, but beside that the film worked really well thanks to some great performances and a great script. It was good to see Woody Allen acting again after six years (the last time was in Scoop) and he is always a charm on camera. I think I'm enjoying Wordy Allen's films a lot more now than I did his older ones, although it probably has to do because I understand him better now. In To Rome with Love he once again seems to blab about the usual topics such as love, infidelity, fame, success, and death in a very funny and original way. I am a huge Ellen Paige fan, so I was excited to see her on a Woody Allen film and she was just great in the few scenes she shared with Jesse Eisenberg. She never disappoints. I had some high expectations for this film and it never disappointed me. Woody Allen seems to have found a pretty nice groove in Europe and has written yet another very funny comedy. Most fans will be satisfied.The film takes place in Rome where we have several different romantic stories taking place. These stories aren't interconnected with each other (other than the fact that they all take place in Rome) and probably aren't in the same time frame either. First we are introduced to Hayley (Alison Pill), an American tourist who is asking for directions to a local she runs into named Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti). He gladly takes her to the spot she's looking for and romance blossoms between them. Then we are introduced to Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni), a married man who's routine life changes all of a sudden when he becomes an instant celebrity (for no apparent reason). John (Alec Baldwin) is a successful architect who is visiting Rome, the city he lived in when he was a student. He runs into Jack (played by Jessie Eisenberg) who takes him to the very same place where he used to live when he was young. We soon discover that John really is reliving his past through Jack. Jack is living with his girlfriend Sally (Greta Gerwig) and her best friend Monica (Ellen Paige) is going to be staying with them for a couple of days. Jack can't help but fall in love with Monica. Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) and Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) are a recently married couple from the south of Italy who have arrived in Rome for a job proposal. Milly gets lost in the big city and Antonio has a mistaken encounter with a prostitute named Anna (Penelope Cruz) that will lead to a huge mix up. Woody Allen also has a role in this film as Hayley's father who comes to meet Michelangelo's family.Each one of the stories work really well in my opinion although I did laugh a little harder with Roberto Benigni's scenes which remind us all of the perks of being a celebrity, as well as the disadvantages (the overly exaggerated media attention). Woody Allen was also great as the frustrated Opera director who can't seem to enjoy the idea of retirement and associates it more with dying. I think that is his personal philosophy and thus the reason why he continues to make films at such a fast pace. He refuses to retire from directing. The mix up between Penelope Cruz and Alessandro Tiberi also makes for some funny scenes, but my favorite story had to do with the love triangle between Jessie Eisenberg, Greta Gerwig, and Ellen Paige. There were so many different things going on in this film, but somehow Allen managed to make the film work in such a way that every character was made interesting. I'm usually not a fan of these multiple stories in one film, but here it works really well and the surprising thing is that the stories weren't even interconnected with each other. But it works because Rome becomes the central theme of the film. I really had a fun time with this movie and would recommend it.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A typical Woody Allen type comedy. Four major story lines going on. If you like his style you will like this movie. I say B-,"""In this city all is a story."" Much like any Woody Allen movie this movie has multiple story lines. A man trying to revisit his past in the city he grew up in. A newlywed couple having troubles during their honeymoon. A semi-retired opera producer trying to find the next big star and a man who gets what he wants, only to find out the phrase ""be careful what you wish for"" is true. There isn't much to say about this movie to convince you to watch or not watch. This is a Woody Allen movie and he has a built in audience already. On the other hand he also has a real style that turns people off and they won't watch because it is a Woody Allen movie. I thought this was OK and I am not a Allen fan at all. I really liked his last movie (Midnight In Paris) but this one was more of his older style and more quirky and I just don't like his style of humor. Also just as a heads up half the movie is in Italian with subtitles (in case that bothers you). I thought the movie is OK but definitely Woody's style of comedy.

a waste of 112 minutes of my day,"This would be one of the worst films ever for a comedy, there was a couple of funny things but other than that it was a really terrible film. I have liked a lot of Woody Allen films but not this one. It was written and directed by Woody Allen and it seems like he was desperate for him to have a part in a film. I liked the start of the film with the policeman directing traffic explaining what he sees of the people and tourists in Rome and the idea of the stories about those people but one of the story lines just didn't make sense and the other were just silly.

Messy but very enjoyable,"With this movie Woody Allen made one of his dreams come true of make a film in Rome, emulating to some of his idols as Fellini or Rosselini, having as a final result a very Italian movie .When the Italian producers proposed Allen to make a movie that takes place in Rome, the American director using some notes and with the help of his friend Martin Solibakke developed a really messy script that tells 4 different stories (2 in Italian and 2 in English) with the only connection between them that all of them takes place in Rome.As a result the film is a bit messy having some stories that doesn't really fit with the rest of the movie , for example the story starred by Roberto Benigni is really out of place with the rest, but although of that, the film in terms of quality is pretty good and never falls in boredom , keeping you interested in all the stories until the very end and having that magical charming that Allen always is able to put in his films ...",,Anonymous,Music
To Rome with Looseness... Would be more precise,"I am very selective in watching movies by and with Woody Allen, I am no loyal admirer of him. His plots are uneven and dragging, and the characters performed by him are almost lookalikes - irrespective with topic, age, era etc. But this time I was eager to see how the event fit into The Eternal City - Rome, which I have visited several times.And I had my joy of recognition from the very beginning, and soon several witty and versatile events began to develop, making me giggle from time to time as there are many funny lines and scenes. Typical to Allen, there are lots of confusions, multi-levels and reasonings, but as the movie lasts a bit over 1,5h, they did not become boring. The cast is also interesting, but uneven: great performances were carried out by Penelope Cruz, Alec Baldwin, Jesse Eisenberg, Roberto Benigni... The rest - and especially other actors from Italy - were not catchy. As the city of Rome is the major supporting actor, I cannot imagine how this movie would be comprehended without prior visiting - probably not so much.To Rome with Love is a quality entertainment, but definitely not among the best works by Allen. On the other hand, I can't see why his fans could get disappointed; so, you have been warned! :)",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Enjoyable, but lacking","Quite liked it, obviously not one of his better movies but even on a bad day I still think Allen does a better job with rom-coms than most other directors.It was nice to see Allen return to the screen, still his neurotic old self and keeping the best jokes for himself too. Also, Alec Baldwin's pop-ups made me laugh often. The rest of the cast was fine: not irritating but not particularly memorable either.The main problem I had was keeping up with the plots. The Italian and English mix was confusing at times, and certain plot elements were vague or undisclosed (like the ending of the storyline with Penelope Cruz, that ended quite abruptly) and left me wanting something more.Also, the multiple plot lines resulted in quite a bit of rehashing. With this I mean the fact that there are basically 4 Woody Allen-ish characters (Allen himself, Eisenberg, Benigni and the Antonio character) which after a while started to annoy me, because it started feeling like I was watching 4 different episodes of a series at the same time, and not a particularly coherent series at that.What possibly annoyed me even more though were the two ladies sitting next to me in the theater, who had probably never heard of Woody Allen before but felt inclined to both hum along to every song on the soundtrack that they knew, and to, whenever a famous Roman site was in a shot, meticulously recall what they did at that site during that one time they went to Rome. I actually think that sums up my idea of the film nicely: if you're a Woody Allen fan, you'll probably enjoy the film, but if you're not that fond of him, it's probably better to just buy a picture book about Rome and look at that.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Laughed out loud a couple of times during Allen's exchanges with an undertaker.,"Amusing, good looking (such wonderful light) and affectionate look at the city and its inhabitants. Four fairly insubstantial tales are told alongside each other and some work well enough and others not. The loose remake of Fellini's The White Sheik is very well done and Penelope Cruz gives it her all. The most successful segment is probably that with Alec Baldwin and the beguiling Ellen Page. It is probably the most recognisable picture of Woody Allen and his foibles although he himself is in a less good section with the singer in the shower elevated to operatic stardom - this one joke piece soon wears thin. Similarly thin is the section featuring the most unlikeable Roberto Benigni who seems to be thrust into fame, becomes anxious to get out of the reach of the paparazzi, then to get back in again. A confusing and seemingly grossly over acted piece that is somewhat lost on me because of a lack of subtitles. My print was of Italian origin and featured 'original dialogue'. Unfortunately although there is much English and Italian spoken, I can only assume that where this ever showed in an English speaking country, the Italian would have been subtitled. Anyway am pretty sure I didn't miss too much. Laughed out loud a couple of times during Allen's exchanges with an undertaker.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Why Woody Allen should not star in his own movies,"Woody Allen has made some very important and poignant films and he does have quite a following. When Allen casts himself in movies that he writes and directs they become ego trips and almost unbearably dull as Allen's character is always Woody Allen, despite the costume he is supposed to be wearing to alter his character.TO ROME WITH LOVE has one main character - the glorious city of Rome. The rest of the cast make up little frazzled stories that each seem dispensable: a worker (Robertp Benigni) who wakes up to find himself a celebrity - for a while; an architect (Alec Baldwin) who takes a trip back to the street he lived on as a student now inhabited by a confused contemporary student (Jesse Eisenberg); a young couple on their honeymoon (Alessandro Tiberi and Alessandra Mastronardi) whose life is disrupted by a hooker (Penelope Cruz) and a movie star (Antonio Albanese); and a frustrated opera director (Woody Allen) and his wife (Judy Davis) who on a trip to Rome to meet their daughter and her fiancé (Allison Pill and Flavio Parenti) has a talent for discovering talented singers and 'discovers' his future in-law (Fabio Armiliato) who sings opera arias well - but only in the shower. It all sounds silly and it is.Were it not for the beauty of Rome the film could be easily dismissed as one of Woody Allen's 'off films'. Even a cast of very fine actors can't save this from drowning in the overdone and fallen cake.Grady Harp",2.0,Anonymous,Music
The Eternal City has stories you won't believe,"To Rome With Love (working title The Bop Decameron) is a bit hit-and-miss, but when it hits its stride it is tremendous fun. Don't let the generic title put you off. It's actually a much funnier film than its illustrious predecessor, Midnight in Paris (2011).The movie begins unpromisingly, with a traffic cop addressing the viewer, saying he knows and sees more of what's going on than anyone else. We then get introduced to the various players in the different stories. At this point we move into magical-realist territory.Alec Baldwin plays an architect, John, who meets a younger version of himself, Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) and tries to shepherd him away from repeating the same romantic missteps. A young married couple arrive in Rome and become separated, the husband playacting alongside an escort, Anna (Penelope Cruz), the wife dazzled by various celebrities she meets when she gets lost in the city's labyrinth of streets and squares. Elsewhere, Leopoldo Pisanello, an ordinary salaryman (Roberto Benigni) miraculously becomes a celebrity over night and finds his every move and thought being pored over by an insatiable media. Lastly, Woody Allen himself plays a retired music industry professional, come to meet his daughter's new fiance, and discovering that the prospective father-in-law is a mortician with a beautiful tenor voice. He decides to make him a true opera singer, despite his peculiar situational handicap.It takes a while to settle, but To Rome has so many things going for it. The lovely light, the lovely warm scenery, and some beautiful faces. Allen once again resurrects the character of the hot-crazy-mess in his Baldwin/Eisenberg story, and the story about the young Italian couple is delightfully played by all, especially Cruz as the hooker. Allen and Judy Davis are good value as the visiting parents, and the opera production towards the end is hilariously plausible, assuming you've seen what can happen in European opera houses (in a word, pretentiousness - it knows no bounds). Best of all, I'd say, is the Pisanello story about an overnight celebrity. Benigni and a throng of looky-loos, this is the celebrity satire that failed to materialise in 1998's Celebrity.It would have been nice if Allen could have tied the stories together, and we'll never precisely know if Eisenberg is imagining Baldwin's intrusive commentator, or vice-versa, or both at the same time. To Rome is at its best sexy and funny and visually beguiling, and basically entertaining. You can skewer it with a fork but you can also savour the meat.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Lets spend two hours self deprecating,"BARFCreated this profile to down-vote this movie. Horrible, everything up-played about why an amazing country is tanking. I get the intentions, but pathetic. I laughed once. Even the Italini were bad at acting Italian If you have extremely low self esteem and assume everyone has no respect for each other, this might be entertaining. Unfortunately, like a horrible car wreck, I stopped to see it all the way through. Go to Rome, actually experience it and if you can, live there.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Paris is better.,"""If you stop a hundred Romans, they'll tell you: I could give you a million stories."" Woody Allen's production notesRome has always been more hectic and less romantic than Paris to me but with equally competing foods and women. Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris is more romantic and humorous than To Rome with Love. The latter is flat by comparison, a picture post card of four vignettes rather than a short story with heft. After all, he opens it with Volare, hardly his usually sophisticated jazz and much too pop for a mature director/writer.Although I loved seeing Woody as a retired, avant-garde producer of operas, grousing in his usual way about the world's annoyances such as airline discomfort, the rest of the story, which involves instances of Seventh Commandment violations along with the illusions of celebrity, is generally dull and will be unprofitable for the Woodman: ""You're famous for being famous"" is one person's answer to why the negligible Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni) is besieged by reporters. It's Woody's weak interpretation of a major theme. Oh, well.With a writing Oscar for Midnight, Woody should have had better dialogue. Not to be. Yet even setups like the mortician who can sing glorious opera only when he is in the shower lead Woody to opera scenes that bore after the first splash of shower (the allusion to Woody's own successful staging of Puccini's Gianni Schicchi makes this sequence even more painful by contrast).A minor delight is Alec Baldwin as John, an architect, who acts as a Greek chorus for a young Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) about to compromise his relationship with Sally (Greta Gerwig) for her friend, Monica (Ellen Page). John's ironic admonitions about Jack's foolishness (heard and seen at times by only Jack—think Bogart in Play It Again, Sam) are spot-on, e.g., calling Monica ""a self-absorbed pseudo-intellectual."" Not enough Baldwin, however, to save the film.After all the infidelity the Eternal City induces on visitors and locals alike, the film becomes just postcards of famous places like the Trevi Fountain and The Spanish Steps, places that become a cliché like this film.",,Anonymous,Music
A mixed bag,"In this Woody Allen film, four stories are played out in modern-day Rome among Italians and American visitors and students.The four stories have varying results. One involves young newlyweds from an Italian small town moving to Rome and getting used to the big city. This segment was well acted and pleasant in its farcical ways. However, the laughs are mild as many of the gags seem to have come from old sitcoms.Allen stars in another sequence along with Judy Davis. Again, certain laugh-getters are repeated too often. Also, this story's main plot is about a singer who sings brilliantly in the shower but not otherwise. This story-line was already played out in a superb but under-rated Chinese film ""Shower"" (1999).In another sequence, Roberto Benigni plays an ordinary man who is suddenly vaulted to fame and is adored by media and the public. Though sometimes flawed, this is one of the better sequences in exposing the vapid collective insanity of celebrity worship.The best sequence is the one involving Alec Baldwin, Jesse Eisenberg, and Ellen Page. Like the Benigni sequence, it exposes the superficiality of a wannabe celebrity who does much of her acting offstage. It's sometimes hard to understand whether Baldwin's character is real or imaginary but the rest of this segment is quite clever.A mixed bag for sure with some sequences much better than others.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Portrait of a fairy tale Rome,"I was very curious of watching this movie and how Woody Allen would have portrayed Rome and I must say I was hugely disappointed. Allen depicts a fairy tale Rome with unrealistic clean streets of the working class Trastevere neighborhood and with an unrealistic color of the picture which gives the idea of being in some wonderland. Another example of how Allen has a strange idea of Italy and its inhabitants is how the couple Milly and Antonio, coming from a provincial life, are dressed, which is with clothes youngsters would have wore in the 50s. It's clear by some scenes of the movie how the director wanted to deliver his homage to Rome and to Fellini, but he totally misses the soul and the essence of the eternal city. After watching this movie I wonder if Woody Allen's recent previous movies, set in European cities, which I was pretty pleased with, had the same effect on the inhabitants of the concerned cities as ""To Rome with Love"" had on me. However I give this movie a 6 because I found Allen's jokes funny and the scenes of Giancarlo, the aspiring Tenor, performing in the shower very amusing.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Don't waste your time.,"Horrible movie. First off let me preface this review by saying I am a Woody Allen fan, I've seen all his movies. Some better than others but none insult the audiences intelligence the way this one does. The only way to watch it is with the sound off so you can enjoy the spectacular cinematography and make up your own story. By doing this, even a three year old could make up a story more interesting and with more logic and sense than this. If you'll read a few reviews with more stars than mine, you'll notice no one mentions the plot/s of the movie. Some don't even really praise the movie in any way but the reviewer still gives 3 or 4 stars. Why? Because it's a Woody Allen movie and critics, actors and the public can't bear to say anything negative about the sometimes brilliant Woody Allen. My guess is after the fine actors were shown the final cut of this film, many frantically called their agents trying to get cut from the film. It's that bad! Nothing makes sense in the movie and suspending disbelief is just to arduous a task here as it is required constantly throughout the film. If you want to be as infuriated as I was that you wasted 2 hours of your life, or want to see how far a film icon like Woody can fall, by all means knock yourself out. You should do what I wish I had done, watch Vicky, Christina Barcelona again and remember Woody for the genius he can be. Please Woody, get a co-writer and/or someone you can trust to be honest with you. This script, or lack there of, should never have been made. Your legacy suffers.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Woody Allen latest movie is slight but fun,"Woody Allen's choral film set in Rome shows that at 76 he can still be a fine filmmaker. It consists of four intercalated though unrelated episodes, two with Italians in the center, one with Americans and the last with both Italians and Americans.In episode 1 (the numbers I gave to each of the episodes is arbitrary), a somewhat naive newlywed couple from an Italian small town (Alessandro Tiberi and Alessandra Mastronardi, who resembles a young Marisa Tomei, and is great as the beautiful but plain Milly) comes to Rome. A series of circumstances will make them to be separated and face temptation, he to a prostitute catering to Rome's high class (Penelope Cruz), she to a famous if somewhat pathetic older actor (Antonio Albanese).In episode 2 (not completely bad, but probably the weakest of the four), Roberto Benigni, overacting as usual, is a Roman everyman who suddenly and inexplicably becomes a celebrity hounded by the press.In episode 3 (probably the best), Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) is an American student living in Rome with his sweet if somewhat bland girlfriend, Sally (Greta Gerwig). Soon the two are joined by a friend of Sally, the unemployed actress Monica (Ellen Page). The beautiful Monica is a great creation by the screenplay, a neurotic pseudo intellectual always quoting authors she has scarcely read. Under a veneer of worldly sophistication, she is a vain, shallow and vapid woman. As Monica tries to seduce Jack, Jack is advised by Alec Baldwin (a middle aged architect visiting Rome) that it would be foolish to leave the dependable Sally for the unstable Monica. The Baldwin character starts realistically but ends up being something of a ghost, since he materializes in every place and only Jack seemingly sees him. In his role as a ghostly adviser to a young male on questions of women and love, he resembles the Bogart character in Allen's great comedy of 40 years ago, the underrated ""Play it Again, Sam"".In episode 4, Alison Pill is an American tourist who falls in love with a left wing Roman lawyer. Soon she brings her parents from the States (Woody Allen and Judy Davis, who is great as his shrink wife, always ready to psychoanalyze every one of Woody's decisions) to meet her new in laws. Allen is a retired former executive in the classical musical business, and after listening to Giancarlo (played by Fabio Armiliato, a real life Italian tenor), the father of his son in law, singing in the shower, he tries to convince him to try a career as an opera singer, to amusing results.Some might say that the episodes are slight (and in a way they are right) but the movie contains some wise reflections on old age, fame, love, whether is better to settle or try for more, etc. In any case, I (and the audience with which I saw it) enjoyed quite a lot. The message of the film seems somewhat conservative: if you are happy with what you are, why aspire for more if that means you have to sell your soul. That might be a right message, though it strange to hear it from the famous Allen.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Average Woody.,"Four stories set in Rome that never really intertwine. One with a mortician dad who can only sing in the shower being put on stage by Woody. Another with Roberto Benigni being famous for no reason and not understanding why, Another with Eisenberg falling in love with Ellen Page while a possible ghost Alec Baldwin tells him not to, and the final one about two newlyweds who get separated and end up cheating with other people.After Midnight in Paris, this was a let down. It's not bad, but not amazing either. Maybe if the stories had connected in some way it wouldn't have felt so sleight, but it's just short little, cute tales with lots of adultery.

Don't watch this film,"This miserable excuse film pretty much summarized everything I hate about Woody Allen. It was another over sentimental nostalgic sickening tribute to European cities and his own irritating pretentious ideas. Aside from Alec Baldwin's performance, the acting was poor to say the least. Although at times slightly amusing, the jokes were usually fairly awful and I ended up finding every character in the film inherently irritating, and unlike Owen Wilson Jesse Eissenburg or whatever his name is, was nowhere close to providing a strong lead role in order to make the film watchable. I'm only going to give this film a 2 for Alec Baldwin, without him it would a definite 0.I'll be sure to keep clear of his next film, make sure you stay away from this one.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
"Another Woody Allen gem. A fresh and funny film, packed with jokes, beautiful long shots, great writing and a wonderful cast. 10/10","Jerry (Woody Allen): ""Don't analyze me, Phyllis, okay? You know, many have tried and all have failed. My brain doesn't fit the usual id-ego-superego model!""Phyllis (Judy Davis): ""No, you have the only brain with three ids.""Yesterday I watched with my kids To Rome With Love, by the genius Woody Allen, for the 100th time. Such a great movie! Hilarious, amusing, and cool: full of jokes and funny moments.Woody manages (as always) to tell his story with humour, deep, jokes and more. This time he tells 4 stories, all amusing and imaginative.I love that Woody is in the movie, accompanied by the great and beautiful Judy Davis. When they first appear, in the plane, we already get Woody's philosophical humour. He says to Judy: ""I can't unclench when there's turbulence. You know, I am an atheist.""My favorite character is Leopoldo Pisanello, played brilliantly by the hilarious Roberto Benigni. We laugh every second that he's in the movie. The Italian actors Alessandro Tiberi (Antonio, Milly's husband), Alessandra Mastronardi (Milly), Antonio Albanese (the famous actor Luca Salta), and Riccardo Scamarcio (the hotel burglar) are all hilarious. The legendary Ornella Muti appears 10 seconds in the film.Fabio Armiliato is a very well-known opera tenor singer who plays the role of Giancarlo beautifully and sings amazing (in the shower). Armiliato has had leading roles and sung in the most prestigious opera houses of the world (Metropolitan Opera House of New York, La Scala in Milan, and L'Opéra de Paris).Alec Baldwin is great as always. Jesse Eisenberg plays to the perfection the role of a shy and confused young man. Penélope Cruz is wonderful and beautiful as always. Alison Pill (Hayley)'s performance is very fresh, and Flavio Parenti (who is Michelangelo, Hayley's fiancé) is great in his role as an angry ultra left-wing young man. Monica Nappo plays amazingly Pisanello's humble wife.Since Page and Gerwig opportunistically stabbed Woody right after the world saw Dylan Farrow's crocodile's tears in January 2018 (she's been trying to destroy Woody with her prefabricated story for ages), I can't stand watching them onscreen. Their treason, hypocrisy and opportunism will be always remembered (unlike their acting). Nevertheless, the lines that Woody wrote for them are really good.The cinematography of the film is really beautiful. Cinematographer Darius Khondji (born in Iran but majored in Film at New York University) worked previously with Woody in Anything Else (2003) and Midnight in Paris (2011) and would go on working with Woody in two other films: Magic in the Moonlight (2014) and the masterpiece Irrational Man (2015). Other great works of Khondji include Delicatessen (1991), La cité des enfants perdus (1995), Alien: Resurrection (1997), and Amour (2012). He also worked as a cinematographer in many videos of Madonna.To Rome With Love is rated in IMDB ""restricted"". I really don't know why. Maybe because Penélope plays a prostitute? Well, as we all know in the States it's OK to watch movies with thousands of bombs, guns, and killers, but love and sex are more dangerous and always restricted. Funny country...To Rome With Love is another Woody Allen gem. A fresh and funny film, packed with jokes, beautiful long shots, great writing and a wonderful cast. 10/10The worst: that Page and Gerwig contaminate the film (two ungrateful hypocrites who opportunistically stabbed Woody) .The best: all the funny moments, Woody, the great Judy Davis, Roberto Benigni, and the cinematography.We love you, Woody!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Very Disappointing Buffet of Nothing Much,"After the critical and commercial successes of ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona"" and ""Midnight in Paris,"" Woody Allen follows these city- tributes up with another one, this time for the Italian capital of Rome. In my opinion though, unlike the previous two films mentioned, ""To Rome with Love"" had honestly nothing to love about it.The whole film is a string of four different strange stories with apparently nothing to do with each other.Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) is an American student living in Rome with his fiancée. When his fiancée's best friend Monica (Ellen Page) comes to visit, Jack gets attracted to her. His friend John (Alec Baldwin) advises Jack accordingly. While Eisenberg and Page have great chemistry together, the seemingly imaginary nature of Baldwin's character makes this episode strange.Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni)is a man who suddenly becomes an overnight celebrity for no apparent reason. This story is downright senseless and lame-brained. I cannot imagine how Woody finds this story funny in any way. Benigni seemed to just being himself, stupidly.Antonio and Milly are a newly wed couple from a small town who are in Rome to meet some relatives. Milly loses her way when she was looking for a hairdresser and gets caught up in a tryst with movie ""sex symbol"" Luca Salta. Meanwhile, Antonio was hooking up with prostitute Anna who entered their hotel room by mistake. This episode was also pretty annoying as well as silly, with only the luminous Penelope Cruz, who played Anna, as the saving grace.Woody Allen himself returns in front of the camera as Jerry a music producer who visits Italy to meet his daughter's fiancé and his family. He was so taken by the great operatic voice of Giancarlo, the fiancé's father played by real-life tenor Fabio Armiliato, that Jerry wants to promote him. But alas, it turns out Giancarlo can only sing well when he is in the shower! Again this becomes another disappointingly preposterous episode.Ultimately, you will feel like this film is an absolute waste of time. You do not get anything out of it, not even a good feeling. This is a big disappointing letdown from Mr. Allen especially as he is coming off a series of film successes. ""To Rome with Love"" will definitely NOT be one of those successes.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Love Mr. Baldwin with all my heart. Woody Allen should take a brake from the ""one movie a year deal"". A movie a year is great IF the movie is good, if not stay at home and please write again. This can't be the work of the same guy who gave us Vicky, Christina Barcelona!!! Not to mention his earlier work. Good things? the music is great and the location it's perfect!!!

A silly movie that should be boxed and buried by Giancarlo,"This movie belongs in the 1950's not the 20teen's, because that's what it is, a 1950's style rich people in Europe (Italy here) living goofy lives. If this film had been released 57 years ago it would have been proclaimed as comic genius by the intellectual theatre set. But today it's just a mishmash of half-baked ideas thrown together with beautiful photography and sets to keep the viewers attention.After the grotesque disappointment I suffered watching 'Midnight in Paris', I was most anxious to see Woody Allen pull a winner out of his hat. With this wonderful cast and reading many glowing reviews I was sure this movie would be a winner. Unfortunately it is silly, simple, and above all very predictable. Who could not see the opera singing father being put on stage in a shower stall by Jerry??? And Monica being a complete fony and flaky.At one point I decided to finish the flick only because it's a Woody Allen movie.

"To Rome With Love - A Beautiful, Hilarious Fantasy.","Midnight in Paris is my favorite Woody Allen film. Something about that movie just really connected with me, and I've probably seen it ten plus times. I also loved films that showcase a great city, like Allen did with Midnight in Paris in 2011 and Vicky Christina Barcelona in 2008. So as you could imagine, I was extremely excited for Allen's latest city love-letter, To Rome With Love, which came out last year. I finally got around to watching it. Did it deliver? Absolutely! To Rome With Love is an absolutely immersing, beautiful, hilarious experiences, and if you can ignore it's few minor flaws, it's completely awesome! The movie focuses on four different story-lines, and though this can get a little bit messy at times, I think this structure worked great. The film is filled with likable, funny characters, beautiful scenery of Rome, and colorful, hilarious dialog. Another one of my favorite things about this movie is the great soundtrack. It fits the movie's tone and pace perfectly, and keeps the narrative on it's feet. There is so much to love in To Rome With Love, it's definitely one of my favorite films of last year, and I would completely recommend this romantic, funny, fantasy. Ignore the critics, this one is definitely worth checking out. 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not Much Love for ""Rome""","One of Woody Allen's easily disposable movies, full of half-baked ideas and a bunch of story lines, none of which is interesting enough, either dramatically or comedically, to hold your interest.The best part of the film, other than its gorgeous Italian setting, is the presence of Allen himself and that of one of his regulars, Judy Davis. Any time the film veered away from them, I sat impatiently waiting for their return, despite the fact that the film gives these two actors, both so talented at being funny, absolutely nothing funny to do. But the film doesn't give any of its cast -- which includes Alec Baldwin, Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, Greta Gerwig, Roberto Benigni and Penelope Cruz -- anything to do either, so Davis certainly shouldn't take it personally. She just landed herself in one of Allen's stinkers. Too bad she couldn't have gotten a part in ""Blue Jasmine,"" a film that reminded me why I return to Allen again and again despite his tendency to make three terrible movies for every good one.Grade: C-",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Disappointing,"Woody Allen gives us 4-stories and performs in one of them. 1. A very good opera singer is discovered. 2. John (Alec Baldwin) appears and disappears almost at will and, at times, proclaims what will and won't happen if certain actions are/are not taken. 3. A newlywed passes a prostitute off as his wife. 4. Roberto Benigni plays Leopoldo who is a favorite target of paparazziNone of the stories are related as in a CRASH scenario. Sorry.The movie moves along nicely, but only because the scenery around Rome is so captivating, and Allen lets us see many historical buildings. The stories we see have no substance, no pull and we wonder why they are there and why was this made.The only good line I found was when someone said of (prostitute)Anna (Penelope Cruz) in a very tight, and obscenely seductive red dress when they were going on a tour of the Vatican: Will they let her in? That was it folks. See? That was the only line I chuckled at. Anna was pretending to be Millie, Antonio's (Alessandro Tiberi) wife due to another mix-up and misunderstanding.Well, you ask where was(newlywed) Antonio's wife Millie? She got lost in Rome and runs into a huge movie star who wants her opinions on things, but in his hotel room. Ahhh! See?Allen,as Jerry, finds Giancarlo (played by opera singer: Fabio Armiliato) his future In-Law, and who he feels is an exceptional opera singer, but can only perform in a shower. Give me a break. And, it is here that the opera singing goes on for way too long at times. My uncle used to sing opera in the truck as we went somewhere. I would always tell him: I think I heard a wounded animal out there.John (Alec Baldwin) appears to Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) who lives with Sally (Greta Gerwig) but has eyes for her friend Monica (Ellen Page) and John seems to tag along with them wherever they go. Sometimes others address him, but at other times it seems he is only visible to Jack. He constantly gives forth his knowledge of life. Was this some form of ""magic"" that was so crucial to MIDNIGHT IN Paris? We were not amused.And, Roberto Benigni (yes, you all wondered where he went ) as Leopoldo who is the target of the paparazzi for a reason explained by his one-time chauffeur: they want someone to be famous and they make him so and follow him everywhere. Well, something like that. See, no pull. And, these scenes are clever in the beginning, but go on for too long and become annoying. Not funny. Just annoying.When we see a Woody Allen movie we expect some comedic lines whether the movie is a drama or a comedy that he writes and directs. What we have here are very bland slices of life that have no relevance, hence no pull, but we keep watching because we feel something good will come along and make all the blandness worthwhile. Didn't happen. Yes, this was disappointing. (5/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: One F-bomb spoken by Monica",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Bland,"One of Woody's worst, probably my second least favorite after September (though I'll admit I haven't seen a lot of his films from the past 20 years). It's just so damned bland. Several plot lines, none of them interesting, play out with a mostly unexplored Roman backdrop (despite appearances by a few tourist attraction, this could have taken place anywhere in the world). The most notable one probably concerns Jesse Eisenberg, his girlfriend Greta Gerwig and her sexy best friend Ellen Page, with Alec Baldwin commenting upon them like a fly on the wall (we're never sure what exactly the situation is with Baldwin - either he's a Humphrey Bogart-like spirit like in Play It Again Sam or if he's the protagonist looking back on his own past). Another story concerns Alison Pill and her new beau introducing their parents to each other. Woody Allen annoys immensely as Pill's father (thankfully not her boyfriend) and Judy Davis is her mother. Allen, a former classical record producer, discovers that his daughter's soon-to-be father-in-law is a great opera singer, but only if he's in the shower. Thus plays out a hackneyed plot that I literally saw on the Pebbles and Bamm Bamm Show when I was a kid (I'm pretty sure). Two other, Italian language plot lines involve Roberto Begnini as a normal man who starts to get followed around by the paparazzi and a young couple who accidentally get split up and then end up with a prostitute and a movie actor. The Italian language plots I mostly lost track of after a while because I got bored of reading the subtitles for such an inconsequential endeavor.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
To the fans with love,"Woody Allen is not everyones taste. Just the fact he is in most/some of his own movies, might be a turn off for most. But this one is a series of different stories all grounded in Rome. A decade ago no one would've guessed that Mr. Allen would ever do a movie outside of New York. And here he is touring Europe now! Maybe Rome will become his new muse (no pun intended) after London.The fact that we have so many stories with so many different characters also means, that we get different quality in those stories. So you may like one storyline more than the other. The one involving Woody Allen wasn't my favorite, because it was too obvious what he was trying to make there. My personal favorite is the one with Alec Baldwin. It's a tricky one, if you want it to be. And very well written too!",8.0,Anonymous,Music

The boring clerk who suddenly becomes a celebrity for no reason. Like most celebrities.The dialog is funny also this time. Especially when Allen himself is involved.

Horribile (web),"Well, having an handful Allen's movie under my belt now (just because he casts actresses I like like Amanda, Natalie, Monica), i wasn't expected much of this movie.

I cannot say either if it's an Italian movie that speaks sometimes English or the contrary, but in the end, the double languages are tiring.

Finally, even the locations are trashy: sure, you explore Roma a lot but the golden cinematography kills everything!

A Nutshell Review: To Rome With Love,"I've only started to follow the works of Woody Allen more closely when he brought his filmmaking out of New York and into Europe, where he had made a number of films in the UK, and continues his sojourn through the continent with odes to her major cities, from Barcelona to Paris and now Roma, or Rome. And true to Allen's form, this film was really done with love, about love, and with the usual self-deprecating humour each time Allen decides to go in front of the camera as well.Fans will undoubtedly lap up his writing and characterization featured in the film, where he tackles no less than four separate story lines, making up a myriad of stories about love and relationships set in the eternal city. And all things interesting about the film really had Allen's writing strength to thank, to make up scenarios and situations so differently, revolving around the emotion's broad theme, coupled with his pull to get recognizable names attached to his project, as we gaze at the backgrounds of what the city had to offer, and do a little bit of star-gazing as well.Starring in one of the roles himself, Allen plays Jerry, a retired music executive who is in town with his wife Phyllis (Judy Davis), who are there to celebrate their engagement of their daughter Hayley (Alison Pill) to Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti), an Italian lawyer with values quite unlike Jerry's, and threatens to tear everything apart. That, and coupled with Jerry's insistence in making a business out of the voice of Michelangelo's father, the mortician Giancarlo (Fabio Armiliato), after hearing the latter singing in his shower, meant a clash of values and an almost absurd, comedic take on desperate innovation of the opera. Allen though, didn't manage to break out of his usual mold in the characters that he play, and Judy Davis' sarcasm looked pretty much scripted and poorly delivered, but fortunately Armiliato steals the show with his down to earth character.Then we have Penelope Cruz barge into the scene, and pretty much stealing everyone's thunder in her segment, where she plays call girl Anna. Here, an Italian couple Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) and Milly (Alessandra Mastronardi) are about to embark on a new life in the city, but their first experiences are separate, and we get two story arcs instead. Antonio gets tangled with Anna, who barges into his hotel room when Milly was away, mistaking him for someone else whom she has to service, while Milly's solo venture brings her onto a film set, where she gets to meet her film idol Luca Salta (Antonio Albanese), who turns out to be quite the slimy celebrity he is. Expect the unexpected here, with the primary couple being faced with temptation just when they least expect it!And celebrity is a theme explored in the segment headlined by Roberto Benigni, who plays an everyday, average Joe, leading an unspectacular life, until he finds himself suddenly, and inexplicably, thrust into the limelight of celebrity, living it up, and lapping at all the attention showered upon him. In some ways this is quite the surreal story arc that doesn't really fit too well with the others, since it's fantastical, but has a degree of examination into how fleeting fame can be, and how fickle are those who put you on a pedestal, only for it to be yanked away once someone else rolls along who provides a different, more popular appeal. It's easy come, and easy go.The fantastical also had a place in the final story arc, that deals with reminiscence and memory, reliving one's regrets. Alec Baldwin stars as a famous architect who may have sold out in his trade, and is in Rome on vacation, trying to retrace the familiar locales he had once come across. He meets Jack (Jesse Eisenberg), an architect student who is living with his girlfriend Sally (Greta Gerwig), whose best friend Monica (Ellen Page) is also bunking in on a post-breakup vacation. The three way relationship between Jack, Sally and Monica is what makes this particular arc stand out, dealing with how sometimes we get enamored by another, and are willing to risk it all to try and make things work, but sometimes reality and expectation are moving in vastly different directions, despite warning sites that we may choose to ignore, and are most likely ignoring.The ensemble cast should just about excite any moviegoer to give this Allen movie a go, and to watch how he weaves the narrative in and around the different stories so effortlessly. At the same time, he creates a character out of Rome, that goes beyond the usual sights and sounds of the city all captured into more than just a background for this film, drawing a fine balance to prevent going overboard with the very touristy moments. It's pretty amazing how Allen has a knack in crafting all the characters for the film, since it is no mean feat to have them all distinct, with purpose.One should expect the usual from a Woody Allen movie, and To Rome With Love bears all the usual hallmarks of the director, as he celebrates Rome's allure.

Cab for Mr. Allen!,"The scene opens with a small red haired guy sitting in a movie theatre staring at the flickering images on the screen. The black and white images are reflected in his black framed glasses. His eyes are wide in wonder and awe, he holds a bag of popcorn in his hands but he never eats any. The movie finishes and he remains transfixed as the sparse audience leaves the darkness of the cinema.""I gotta make this movie in Rome, Fellini made his movies in Rome""The red haired guy is now a grey haired old guy and he's talking to someone in staccato, stuttering phrases.""Whaddya mean, I'm no Fellini? Did Fellini ever win an Oscar?""A woman's voice replies like a patient parent trying to explain to a five year old he has to go to bed.""And Bergman made his movies in Sweden but you never went there did you?""""Yeah, I know but Sweden is cold and gloomy""""So were all your Bergman homage movies""""Whaddya mean? hey I gotta tell ya, I got great reviews for those movies and..""""...very few paying customers""""It's not all about money, Fellini never made any money either""""That's the only thing you have in common with Fellini""""Oh, funny! who writes your screenplays?""""Not you, obviously""""Listen, I'm going to make this movie in Rome and that's that""""Enjoy your holiday""""It's not a holiday, I'll be making a movie""""With you it's the same thing""""Listen honey, people will love it, I guarantee it""""Sure they will, everyone loves to look at holiday snaps""""Oh! you really gotta start putting this stuff down on paper""""And you should stop making holiday movies""""Fellini never had to put up with kind of stuff""""He didn't think he was Woody Allen""This is a terrible movie. Don't waste your time. Woody Allen has lost any plot he may have had, as has this movie. It is a hopeless attempt by the once great director to be Fellini and it fails on every level. Apart from the nice photography it is rubbish. It is with a heavy heart that I must write these words about a man that has produced a few of the truly great movies, but I'm afraid I must. Midnight in Paris was bad but this is even worse. Except this doesn't have Owen Wilson, which is the only saving grace I can think of.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
To Rome with Love,"I was too quick to judge Woody Allen's films that take place outside of New York. I still much prefer the more familiar setting of New York in Woody Allen films, but MIdnight in Paris and To Rome with Love prove that Woody knows exactly what he was doing whether he was in the U.S. or not. His 2011 film, MIdnight in Paris won Woody an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. Allen's 2012 film To Rome with Love may not have won him any statuettes, or much critical acclaim, for that matter, but it did prove Allen's prowess outside of New York that film audiences have associated him with through most of his career. Starring Alec Baldwin, Jesse Eisenberg, Ellen Page, and the return of Woody Allen, To Rome with Love, is an entry late, but a worthwhile entry in the career of Woody Allen.In a familiar structure for Woody Allen, To Rome with Love follows four unrelated stories which take place in The Eternal City. In one story we follow a native New Yorker, Haley (Alison Pill) who meets Michelangelo (Flavio Parenti) a lawyer and political leftist. After spending some time together, the two fall in love and plan to marry at the end of the summer. Her parents, Jerry (Woody Allen) and Phyllis (Judy Davis) fly to Rome to meet Michelangelo and his family. Jerry, a retired opera director hears Michelangelo singing and becomes convinced he is a star in the making and sets his sights on turning the shower singer into an opera hit. The audience also gets to know Antonio (Alessandro Tiberi) and Millie (Alessandra Mastronardi) newlyweds who have just moved to Rome so Antonio can take a job with his relatives. Millie gets lost in the city and Antonio, refusing to go to a lunch meeting/introduction of his new wife alone enlists the help of Anna (Penélope Cruz) to pose as his wife. In yet another unrelated story, John Foy (Alec Baldwin), an architect from America who now designs shopping centers stumbles upon Jack (Jesse Eisenberg) an architect student who reminds John of himself 30 years younger. Jack and his girlfriend Sally (Greta Gerwig), a fellow student, are enjoying a vacation when they get a call from Sally's best friend Monica (Ellen Page) who is unexpectedly going to meet the couple in Rome to help herself get over a breakup. Jack and Monica share an instant attraction which builds in intensity the more time they spend together. Luckily for Jack, John is in tow to act as a life guide for Jack in hopes of helping him prevent making a big mistake. The final story finds Leopoldo (Roberto Benigni) a loyal husband and a hard-worker who doesn't have much excitement to look forward in his life suddenly thrust into fame without explanation. All of a sudden, Leopoldo's life is documented by reporters as he is constantly followed by the paparazzo. Stuck between being happy that he is now being noticed and wanting his quiet life back, Leopoldo is left with only being able to ride the wave until he is returned to his former life if he ever is.I will never cease to be amazed at the incredible depth Woody Allen can give to so many stories simultaneously. Often times, throughout my viewing of To Rome with Love, I felt like I was watching a mini-series there was so much independent detail to each storyline. The quality writing of Woody Allen is a facet of his I will never tire of. My favorite part of To Rome with Love, despite Woody Allen's portion of the young love segment, was the time spent with Leopoldo. Just as Woody did in his 1998 film, Celebrity, he takes a scathing look at the celebrity culture, even providing commentary on the differences in treatment male and female celebrities must deal with. Hearing reporters yell out inquiring why Leopoldo's coffee spilled and whether he wears boxers or briefs resonates with anyone who has flipped through a magazine while in line at the grocery store. The way Leopoldo is abandoned when a new ""celebrity"" emerges and resists the quiet life he thought he wanted back, clearly illustrates the fears of those in the public eye rarely explored. Roberto Benigni was a brilliant bit of casting to tell Leopoldo's story. Benigni came to the attention of many American film fans only in 1997 after years in the entertainment industry when he enthusiastically walked on top of the seats at that year's Oscars ceremony to pick up his statuette for Best Actor in the Best Foreign Language winning film, Life is Beautiful. The parallels to Benigni's own life and Woody Allen's focus on the seedy aspects that are lumped in with the glamour of being a celebrity. Each story had its high point, and each added to the overall narrative, but Benigni's was my personal favorite and perhaps had the most to say in regards to society.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Woody fiddles while Rome fails to spark.,"Woody Allen's European tour continues, stopping this time in Rome to tell a quartet of unconnected stories that run from the absurd to listless. It's mishmash Allen in search of Fellini and it gets lost in translation fast.Working four story lines Rome opens swiftly as Allen inter-cuts the pieces but once established they all begin to bog down in vapid dialog, the pace loses energy and the payoff on all four vignettes found to be lacking. It's like channel surfing four mundane TV comedies incapable of holding your attention beyond five minutes.The cast has the usual big names to put in twenty minutes each with Penelope Cruz back to play her hot, high wind Mediterranean bombshell, Alec Baldwin whispering and doing the same things he does in commercials, a cadaverous Judy Davis acting and looking uncomfortable in her own skin, Roberto Benigni doing Roberto Benigni from two decades back and Allen himself showing hints of dementia.Allen's writing is both capricious and lame as he makes observations about the price of fame, the paparazzi, youthful infatuation and singing in the shower with a heavy hand. There's plenty of Fellini homage (Amacord, La Dolce Vita) going so far as to lift the entire plot from The White Sheik for one of the story lines. Little surprise it is the best of the segments but that's not saying much for this Rome ruin.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Woody's dramatic concerns about the allegorical enemy strikes again...,"Back in 2011; a screenwriter named Gil Pander traveled back in time to the roaring 1920s of Paris, and mingled with literary greats in nostalgic fantasy Midnight In Paris. Last year, an entourage of whimsical characters plucked from the same vivid imagination make their way to Rome. And therein lies the structural spine of Woody Allen's latest film, To Rome With Love.Four stories unfold simultaneously in this romantic comedy: a mortician discovers his vocal talent in the shower, a young architect is tempted by his SO's salacious best friend, a pair of newlywed's find themselves entangled in sexual exploits, an office clerk awakens to find himself catapulted to overnight fame.In one particular vignette; American girl next door Hayley spends her summer holiday in Rome and falls in love with lawyer, Michelangelo, in a typical tourist-meets-local encounter. The couple's spur of the moment decision to wed brings forth the arrival of Hayley's retired parents, Jerry and Phyllis--a cynical opera director and his incisive psychiatrist wife.During a get-together hosted by the Italians; Jerry discovers that Michelangelo's father Giancarlo possesses a soprano voice fit to sing Pagliacci in the Vienna Opera House. Plausibly driven by resentment towards retirement--Jerry promptly takes it upon himself to unveil this extraordinary find to the rest of the musical world.At one point; after Giancarlo's live performance involving stage lighting and a portable shower box, Jerry declares that he is one to ""think outside the box"". To which Phyllis tiredly laments (in Allen's archetypal neurotic fashion) ""You equate retirement with death. Giancarlo is an undertaker. He puts people in boxes and you want to think outside the box.""*cue snort*Classical plot structures often take the form of a journey, an escape or a search. With regards to this virtuoso of expressive cinema; Woody Allen's Jerry is fleeing from an invisible, allegorical enemy. Subject matters of doomed love, sex and death have always been dominant themes in Allen's works; provoking the kind of painfully self-aware and deadpan humor unique to his stylistic neurosis. To Rome With Love is no different from those pieces. And audiences familiar with the menagerie of characters as real as Allen's dramatic concerns will delight in this film.It has been many years since Woody Allen graced the silver screen--that our favorite skeptic exits hiatus in his forty-fourth feature is a rare event to be relished by fans.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Even a great artist can't copy him/herself,"The Midnight in Paris Formula didn't work in Rome. Midnight was stupendous, wonderful movie. To Rome With Love was dialed in, and in my opinion had none of the magic of the other movie. The soundtrack was awful...sort of what a director thought Italian music should sound like. He didn't give enough screen time to any main character and as a result we wound up caring about none of them. The switching back and forth gave me a headache. Rome is a visual treat but the shots of the city were like the music. I hate to use the word cliché, but it fits. I classify this flick as mildly entertaining, at best. Woody isn't an actor, we know this. His twitchiness was especially cloying in nearly every scene. He must make a decision not to display neurotic behavior. However, and this is my problem, my expectation level was very high after Midnight in Paris, so I feel let down.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Ozymandias Melancholy,"Greetings again from the darkness. I certainly consider myself a fan of Woody Allen's films and am in awe of his prolific ability to write and direct a new movie most every year since 1969. With so many films to his credit, it's expected that a few will be clunkers. After a pretty nice run of non-New York based films, his love letter to Rome falls short ... not from lack of ambition, but rather from a feeling that these stories have been on his ""to do"" list for too many years. They feel mostly stale and dated.With one of the world's most beautiful and interesting cities as a backdrop, Mr. Allen delivers four stories - none of which intersect with the others. There are some similar shared themes, but mostly what the four stories have in common is mass overacting by all involved. Surprisingly, the one exception might be Alec Baldwin, whose wise-cracking lines are played pretty close to the vest. Unfortunately, all of the other key actors seem to think they are onstage at a dinner theatre and that hyper-activity and bellowing lines are lines required.In one story, Woody Allen (his first acting gig since Scoop) and Judy Davis head to Rome to meet their daughter's (Alison Pill) fiancé (Flavio Parenti). Allen overhears the father singing in the shower and works out a scheme to get him an audition that leads to a career. The father is played by famed Opera tenor Fabio Armiliato and this story is so goofy, it could easily fit into Allen's ""early funny ones"".Another story has newlyweds played by Alessandro Tiberi and Alessandro Mastronardi in a series of innocent happenstance that leads to some not so innocent events that include her favorite actor (Antonio Albanes) and high-priced call girl (Penelope Cruz). Most of this has the feel of a Benny Hill skit.Jesse Eisenberg and his girlfriend Greta Gerwig share time with her visiting friend played by Ellen Page. This is the Alec Baldwin sequence and he is a near-ghost-like entity who pops in to provide obvious advice or warning to the players so they don't make the same mistakes he made as a younger man. This sequence had potential, but never amounted to much.The fourth story is just an absurd commentary on reality TV and instant fame. Roberto Begnini plays a normal Italian citizen and family man who one day gets thrust into the world of celebrity for no apparent reason. See, that's the joke. Probably ten years past the time when this was relevant.Bashing Woody Allen is not my intent here. Simply pointing out that there are four stories and numerous actors and none of it struck a chord with me. Not to say there weren't a few well written lines and a couple of terrific shots of Rome ... just not enough to keep me going for two hours.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Woody misfires,"Gorgeous Rome and a star-studded cast can't save a dreadful script, which is a distant echo of Woody Allen's stronger work. It's magical realism blended with a sex comedy so you certainly can't expect logic to reign, but there are so many things that are stupid on top of being unfunny in these four vignettes that there were more groans than laughs. There was something amusing about the opera singer who can only perform in the shower (Fabio Armiliato) and the satire of the fickle nature of celebrity (Roberto Benigni), but the various sexual maneuvering was tired and unappealing. What a waste of the women in this cast, including Alison Pill, Greta Gerwig, Penélope Cruz, Alessandra Mastronardi, Ornella Muti, and (then) Ellen Page, the last of whom turns in the best performance, with a couple of really lovely moments.At 77, Allen himself seemed to struggle delivering his one-liners, and this was the only time I've ever cringed at his shtick, something I've always enjoyed. Much of the film is surprisingly bland, with some occasional mean-spirited lines sprinkled in (e.g. The quip about the Burmese orphans). I liked how much of it was spoken in Italian and liked seeing the shots in Rome (wish there had been more!), but the script just isn't sharp enough to recommend this film.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
One of Woody's all-time Best and (IMO) funnier than most.,"Everyone in the audience was laughing at the dialog and the funny plots. We were definitely in a crowd of Woody Allen fans, even a new-comer would have been laughing.I read the IMDb reviews before watching this film and not all were so positive, so with trepidation we bought the tickets and I'm SO GLAD we did.I can't remember laughing this much while viewing his other films and I enjoyed nearly all of them. Compared to his last goody, Midnight in Paris, the camera-work and lighting were not as well done, but the humor, the actor's delivery and their lines were spot on.There are 2 characters (male) who deliver lines that are definitely from Woody's own experiences. A few times while watching, I could imagine what it would be like to be in his place or in the place of any famous person that realizes they are just a human-being like we all are, yet battling with ""idol"" frenzied fans.One thing you know you're going to get in Woody's movie is clever, intelligent and very funny dialog. This film delivers all of that and more.Someone commented that this movie is too long or draggy. My husband and I feel that one scene could have been shortened a bit, but all in all, it was just right for anyone who is a Woody Allen fan.Aside from the plots of the film, the views of Rome make you feel like you're there. One can fully understand his enchantment with this culturally rich city and it's ""roman""tic inhabitants.If you love Woody Allen films, don't miss this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Woody Allen's worst movie,"Weak, and quite silly. Probably Woody Allen's worst movie.The stories were mostly incoherent, and farcical. The only one which was meaningful was the Roberto Benigni one, with its examination of everyone having their 15 minutes of fame plus stardom, it's perks, downsides, superficiality and fleetingness. Others are mostly quite dull and meaningless, though they all have their moments.All-star cast does the best it can with the rambling script. Penelope Cruz was the stand-out, and not necessarily for her performance (that red dress...).Setting is amazing, of course. However, this is possibly a smokescreen on Woody Allen's part. His last few movies have all involved stunning European locations, as if the movie is more a travel guide than a drama. (Midnight in Paris wasn't bad though).",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Woody Allen At its best,"When I read all the negatives reviews here I just get mad! Let's put things right first: I'm not an unconditional admirer of Woody Allen. I find him in many of his so called astounding movies, boring because of his uninterrupted dialogs and his permanent excitement and so on and so forth. But some of his films have captivated me, like Midnight in Paris, Whatever works, Hollywood ending,Small Time Crooks.. What I will not deny is that Allen is an incredible observer of human nature and especially of the negative sides of the human being.To Rome with love is typically the film which presents this aspect of Allen's genius. It is a ferocious portrayal of the stupidity of the common man and woman when confronted to medias. Of course the result of these critics is that people will say as above ""Allen's Most Disappointing Film from Europe"", or""a wasted opportunity"" or ""Unbelievably bad....The characters are neither sympathetic, likable, interesting, nor memorable. The plots are like fantasy daydreams but still manage to be incredibly tiresome.""When I check the origin of the review, most of the time I find that the reviewer is either from the US or a continent outside of Europe. Did these reviewers ever set foot in Europe? If they did for how long ? Do they speak the languages of the countries they visited?.. The answer to these questions individually are most probably: NO!I would not be surprised too, that some of them are in a job more or less related to the media or show business. But this is not important because even if you're not related to those type of jobs, Allen in his film points his finger to all of you who watch stupid reality shows on TV, spend hours reading the stupidities of tabloids; if this is not the case maybe you're among those who think you'll solve all your personal problems with a shrink or to be sure no one can blame you for being uncultured, will have the behavior of Monica...Hey! hey! You don't like me stating that! That's what Allen wants to point out in the movie, our foolish behaviors, our snobism; he gives us a hilarious portrait of the idiots who today massacre the operatic repertoire, with their so called ""avant garde"" staging, what we call in French ""relecture of libretto"", that's how last summer Bayreuth Festival had the nerve to present The Ring staged in a Texaco gas station! And there were people to applaud in ecstasy! We had the same in Paris with Aida staged in the Italy of Mussolini with PK machine guns and tanks!Someone here has compared this movie with Midnight in Paris. What a mistake. Midnight in Paris is a superb homage to the French capital. To Rome with Love is a ferocious painting of men and women excesses and which town in the world, which nation in the world represents best the excesses of human behavior? Italy, Rome, Naples, Sicily! People shout like mad at singers if the right C has not been given by the Soprano, drive like mad in the streets of Rome or on the motorway around the Sorrento Peninsula, spend hours with their mobile phone and have two or three of them if not more, can't speak in a normal voice as not to be heard 100 yards around etc... He has softened his critic by giving us some beautiful but not original views of the city and its ruins; but that is the decoration of the plate he serves us to savor. The dish is very spicy and gives us heart-burns because we don't like to be presented with our most spiteful aspects of our characters. In doing so Allen has given a new masterpiece of ferocious humor. Thanks Woody!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A bad joke,"Sorry for throwing another stone, as others have done before me, but they are right!It's hard to believe that Woddy Allen did not realize what a boring film this has become. Just putting a lot of famous faces before a camera is not enough. Alac Baldwin for example has almost nothing to do but look and giving some advises to Jesse Eisenberg that are so unconvincing one thinks he just wandered onto the set and Allen out of the blue gave him some lines to say. We have seen other weak products by Mr. Allen but usually the had some merits to cling to. Here I only looked at my watch hoping time would go by faster. The film feels like someone stole the first draft and executed it without any changes. The jokes are old, lifted from other (better) movies or simply predictable. What a waste of actors! I hope they had at least a good time in Rome, something you don't have when watching this film.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Woody's romance with the old world continues,"Did you ever fancy stealing a ride away with a secret object of your affection, on a pastel Vespa down the cobbled streets of Rome? The melody of the accordion notes weighs in the breeze, aroma of the oak wines rises with gentle swirls and the drama of architecture dallies with our humble veracities.Rome is to romance, as romance to Rome, and Allen reprises the magnificence of the Eternal city, in an intertwined pragmatic tale of several characters. Boasting of a seasoned cast as that of Roberto Benigni, playing the character of Leopoldo, an average Joe turned overnight reality television celebrity, bewildered with his newfound claim to fame, John (Alec Baldwin) playing the alter ego of Jack (Jesse Eisenberg), a young confused architect enticed by his fiancé's promiscuous friend, Monica (Ellen Page), a young actress. A young couple arrives in the city (played by Alessandro Tiberi and Alessandra Mastronardi), only to be lost in the streets, one to wind up in the company of an acerbic escort (Penelope Cruz) and the other on a dreamy date with a dazzling movie star. Woody Allen , braces the camera after a five year gap with a signature neurotic character, Jerry, a retired music producer rummaging for a way to 'leave a mark on this world'. The movie follows the characters disturbing the equilibrium instilled in each of their lives. Leopoldo misses his fifteen minutes of glory once it's over, Monica leaves Jack for a career in Hollywood, the young couple ends up being adulterous and Jerry is publicly criticized for making his discovered artist sing 'Volare' under the shower on stage!The movie, laced with droll dialogue in its convoluted tales, is symbolic of truth of our lives. Each heart desires to cheat the pedantic reality with an intrepid action. Each scheme takes a different course in the light of the day. As the dream follows the day, day follows the dream.Allen, continues his quaint romance with the old world cities, by spinning frothy tales with vibrant tunes of the orchestra and bouncy imagery of talking statues and the ruins of the Colosseum. With dominant performances by Penelope Cruz and Roberto Benigni, the younger lot (Ellen Page and Jesse Eisenberg) leaves something to be desired for the characters portrayed by them. Alec Baldwin, playing the deadpan inner conscience of Jack, is sure to make you buckle at his dispensing of advice ('if you're going to screw your best friend's fiancé, does the venue really matter?') Alessandro Tiberi and Alessandra Mastronardi deliver warm performances as the naïve domestic couple overstepping their boundaries. So make sure all roads lead to ""To Rome with Love"" this weekend to celebrate the genius of Woody Allen.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Plagiarism in To Rome with Love?,"Scent of plagiarism? In the creative arts, it's not possible to copyright the idea for a movie, the plot outline for a new opera. You only have copy able rights to such a product when the thing itself has been produced. As they say, if a writer, or for that matter, a director steals from one person it's plagiarism; if he steals from several it's research. Let's now turn to Woody Allen. One of the US' great original minds. That original that you can hardly picture him as a plagiary. Yet, let us talk about ""To Rome, with love"", Allen's latest accomplishment. What we have here is a hilarious and repeating scene use of an amateur opera singer. An old American visitor of Rome, played by Woody Allen himself , discovers the singing talent of a Roman undertaker. This undertaker, like so many of us, is more than capable as an opera singer when he is taking a shower. This old American visitor of Rome, happens to be an agent, and resolves the amateur's problem by putting a shower on the stage, to allow this talent to sing on a public stage., whilst washing himself on stage.. This scene, an important scene in this film, could also be seen first in a 1999 movie of Chinese director, Zhang Yang. In this film, titled Shower, the scene I s et in a Beijing bathhouse One of the visitors sings ""O sole mio"". Turn out the hot water, the singer is silenced and shameful again. I would argue that Woody Allen has used this very scene in his latest movie. I double checked the credits of Allen's movie: there was no mentioning of Zhang Yang. There was, however, on the credits of another 3 movies that were directed by Allen, (a.o. Sweet and Lowdown) the name of Zhao Fei. The cameraman Zhao Fei is of about the same age as Zhang Yang and Allen publicly praised his work as a cameraman on ""Raise the Red Lantern"" by Zhang Yimou. It seems clear that Allen is no stranger to Chinese film. Which brings us to the big question: is the use of scenes of the amateur opera singer an homage to another fellow director, or is there more than meets the eye. If it is not plagiarism, why was Zhang Yang, who got an 2000 Rotterdam Film Trophy for this piece of work, not mentioned? Eric Horssius.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Very funny parts even if it's not Midnight,How nice to have Woody Allen's humorous look at Italian culture and people especially the paparazzi element. Wonder what country will be next? The formula of different stories intersecting in a European city works.Great to have Judy Davis acting in one of Woody's tailor made roles again. Penelope Cruz is quite good as the sexy Italian. Alec Baldwin's thing with Jesse Eisenberg wore a bit thin. Ellen Page is good. Woody has a good role for himself here. The interesting and not internationally known (except for Roberto) Italian cast lend an authentic flavor and there are lots of subtitles. The opera scenes are hilarious and my favorite.It's not as magical or delightful as Midnight in Paris. But it's not fair to compare it to that gem. We can't expect more of that style anyway. It's a thoroughly pleasant comedy with some unexpected original laughs and is well worth a watch.,8.0,Anonymous,Music
the stories just weren't that good,"I didn't think this movie was that good. The silliest of the stories was the regular guy, Leopoldo, all of a sudden becomes a celebrity. And no reason is given as to why! News reporters and camera men just start following him around and report what he eats and such, and he starts having affairs with beautiful models, even though he's married. It made no sense. The the story with Woody Allen was OK, he plays the dad who's come to Rome to meet his daughter's boyfriend. He hears her dad sing in the shower and thinks he's great. Only problem is the dad only sounds good in the shower, so some how we see him on stage in operas, singing while in a a make-shift shower. So silly. The only good story was the guy whom has a prostitute show up and she's seen by his family, so he pretends she is the girlfriend. They go to this high society party, and a lot of her clients are there. Then the last one involves college students. The girl has her actress friend coming to stay awhile and the boyfriend falls for her. All the while Alec Baldwin keeps showing up and talking to them, but it's not like he's really there. Just weird.FINAL VERDICT: Skip it.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Only apparently superficial,"Woody Allen is a movie director who has a deeply knowledge of modern urban life (his more significant films take place in New York, London, Paris, Barcelona and now Rome) in its various aspects mainly those concerned with human relations namely in what refers to love and the several ways it reveals itself including sex. His movies are only apparently superficial. Behind the good humour with which they are made we often find also drama and frustration. And romanticism is almost always present though not in a very patent image. Besides being charming in terms of images of beautiful Rome, this movie tells us several crossed stories that have to do with the idiosyncrasies of present society mainly one that the story shows admirably: the illusion of the social and with media coverage fame that has its example in the office clerk who becomes suddenly famous without knowing why and with all the inherent public homages and reverences and also the undertaker who sings well opera but only in the shower. These are obviously social caricatures but well presented and performed. On the other hand we have the love relations in the three young couples with the interference of a third party in two cases (the seductive pseudo-intellectual girl in one of them and the fine hotel whore and the famous movie actor in the other). This gives way to a lot of excellent gags and funny situations but which have to do with real sentiments and their realistic evolutions sometimes unexpected but acceptable in terms of psychological reactions. All this i. e. images, scenes, stories, the performers's work and the gags, everything treated, related and shown with great skill make this movie one of the best in the current year",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Wrong place, wrong time","Woody Allen's best film in many years, Midnight in Paris, wasn't really about a great city, it was about the dream of a great city, one seen through the eyes of a perennial college student turned screenwriter whose read the all the books on the reading list, and has had the usual pre-programmed insights. The charm of it is that Woody, now in his late seventies but still the eternal NYU sophomore, can laugh at himself and all his literary pretensions. The trouble with To Rome with Love, however, is that it is not a dream film, but one that pretends to have some deeper insight into the intertwining lives of American living in Rome and their Italian counterparts, but, sad to say, there is no depth whatsoever. Woody is apparently incapable of observing the real world anymore, other than through the double-glazed windows of a 5 star hotel, and if he goes down into the streets, as this film forces him to do, all he seems capable of doing is looking around quickly, buying a few picture postcards, and recycling old Italian films. One of the four plots of this film, the young couple from the Italian provinces, is an embarrassing rip-off of the plot of one of Fellini's earliest films, the 1952 Lo Sceicco Bianco (The White Sheik). If it is meant as a homage to a fellow director, it is a shallow one indeed. The young American actors, fine as they are, are asked to play very tedious characters. They all seem like graduate students trying too hard to learn about life and failing. As for the others, Penelope Cruz is busty and sexy—not much of a stretch--and Robert Begnini underplays a one-joke idea about celebrity, which he does, surprisingly, without his usual zaniness. (That's like casting Jerry Lewis as Prospero.) Judi Davis, of all people, has somehow inherited the part of the typically castrating New York wife, a character who surfaces in many of Allen's films; she's an odd combination of two of the women in Woody's life: Diane Keaton in her quirkiness and Louse Lasser in her kvetchiness. (A remarkable feat for an Aussie, I might add.) Woody himself wanders in and out of his own film, as if he is the wrong place at the wrong time. The Bob Hope jokes and wisecracks, once his trademark, now fall flat. He plays an old man, but he is an old man, all the zest that once was so charming is gone. This is a very bad film from a great director. Perhaps it's time for Woody to stop making one film and year.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
How many broken appendages did Benigni endure?,"Benigni is a legendary actor and widely praised producer. Baldwin isn't quite as versatile but very potent in his own right. So what dirt did Allen have on these two? What pressure did he exert, to force them into what can only be described as pure schlock?Davis is as always the consummate actor and Cruz plays the audience like a musical instrument, but neither are known for being particularly discerning in their choice of roles.There's absolutely nothing new here; if you've ever seen ANY of Allen's creations, you've already seen everything that happens here. Meaningless dialogue, a three-minute story stretched to nearly two hours, and the type of repugnant undertones only Allen is capable of excreting. The ONLY excitement you'll find here is the always-lovely Roman scenery, but you'll want to keep your finger ready on the fast-forward button, 'cause there's nowhere near enough of that scenery to drown out the otherwise unwatchable waste of time.Two stars given purely for the inclusion of Benigni, Baldwin, Davis and Cruz - everything else surrounding this creation deserves precisely zero stars.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Allen's irony enjoyable as usual,"This is a lighthearted, enjoyable film full of humor and irony over human condition. Typical Allen in what he always excels. Don't expect from this film great philosophical and existential dramas. People who leave bad reviews either don't get the irony or maybe it resonates with their personal similar experiences. It is a bit like relatives of Antonio writing some of the reviews. The current 6.3 grade undervalues the film, in my opinion it is a firm 7.5. IMDb in general undervalues European-style films. Watch Allen's film, enjoy the walk through Rome, derive moral lessons at your will. This film is on par with his late films (obvious comparison with Midnight in Paris, Magic in the Moonlight and others). Midnight in Paris probably has a bit more depth,just due to the script. This film consists of four stories developed in parallel, with only the city of Rome joining them together.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Italian ride,"The genius is back for another spin around life's simple things. Woody Allen is, as I have mentioned before, one of my favorite directors for his smart way of tackling any subject and making it a pleasure to watch.""To Rome With Love"" offers not only a stroll through the wonderful city and it's amazingly beautiful spots, but also a very funny comedy of customs and delightful insights. Life itself is a spring of inspirational cues and Allen knows exactly where to step in and make the experience an intelligent ride. Fame and fortune, social concerns and the nonsensical effect of silly preoccupation about things that do not deserve the least of consideration are packed in this Italian adventure that entertains without any serious impact or damage. It's simply a lot of fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Interesting for Mr Allen fans,"If you are already a fan of Mr Allens movies then you are likely to find it interesting to watch and compare to his other films. But it will not campare well to his better movies. Not a bad thing in itself because his mediocre films are better than most peoples career best films. Yes, I am a Mr Allen fan. But this movie was just not a good movie.
It is interesting because there are elements in it that are good and worth watching ( Mr Baldwins part was particularly novel in its use and he had the best line of the movie (involving a propeller) ). Despite multiple good or at least novel elements in the movie, it failed to offer more than good parts that pop up as the movie rolls along. Also, repeated use of dialogue in an English movie, that is not English and has no subtitles, was a counter productive choice. Watching the actors act, in a language other than the language of the movie, can highten a viewers sensitivity to 'the acting' during the dialogue, but it seemed like a failed experiment.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"I give the movie 9 out of 10 - for the cute Italian actress and the helpful, rather unsubtle warning that a relationship with a Hollywood actress is a thing better left alone.","I give the movie 9 out of 10 - for the cute Italian actress, the beautiful Roman scenery and the helpful, rather unsubtle warning that a relationship with a Hollywood actress is a thing better left alone. However, I give this movie one complete point of deduction for being, in my humble opinion, utter rubbish! Just Because Mr. Woody Allen is confused and clearly overburdened by the task of finding a meaning to life, does not mean that he has to torture his audience as well with his lack of purpose. I don't know, perhaps in America Mr. Woody Allen is beyond criticism, and therefore the American audience and his peers regard his work as brilliant no matter how bad it is. Regardless how many movie stars you put into a production, the film remains bad, if the script is bad. This being said, I do admit there was a kind of genius in some of the sub-plots of the movie - you just had to dig very deep to find it, below all the layers of rubbish covering it. So my advice to Mr. Woody Allen is this: You can do better! Just keep it real - less madness and more realism!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Over the top silliness, misses the mark","Having watched several other works of Woody Allen recently and having somewhat enjoyed several but found some lesser than good. This film is quite a miss, and substantially lesser than Midnight in Paris.With four non-connecting stories taken place in Rome, we see brief periods of occasionally everyday occurrences.Much of the film dealt with unrealistic situations and comedy that wasn't present. The story involving the Italian newlyweds with Penelope Cruz playing an escort is possibly the highlight (although quite unrealistic but entertaining).Then the Jesse Eisenberg/Ellen Page storyline- but even with that became very predictable. And the character played by Alec Baldwin was beyond irritating and was not necessary- his presence brought down the entire storyline.A lot of questions weren't answered in the end and things came off as just too bizarre for one. To Rome with Love felt as a comedy trying too hard to please people and it came off as far over the top, unrealistic and just not as enjoyable.Did not have high expectations but was still disappointed and frustrated in the end.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
It's ok,"The background score is cute and suits the movie perfectly, particularly in the first half. It's a strange one. If it's trying to potray human beings as being too fragile, shallow, easily swayed, and without much of an integrity, then that's a bit depressing.It definitely matches the title, it's a love letter to Rome of sorts, the production team clearly love Rome.It's all a bit silly but keeps you hooked just enough to keep watching.Woody Allen's character is interesting, until it becomes one dimensional about the opera.The characters story arcs don't collide and there's no grand finale.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Alen must stay out of acting !,"Love Rome and all extraordinary stories happening there. Good try to show some of them on the big screen. But again the director has a huge lack of the right picture and music. The movie flow is like a river in Sahara! And again Mr.Alen please no need to live your European dream in your movies , these movies are made for us so please see yourself in some good actor like Butler or Ryan Gosling or Javier and stay out of the camera reach! Also when you are next making a movie about some great European city like Rome invite Guy Ritchie crew to help you do a better picture !",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Arrivederci,"At it's best moments, To Rome with Love is a love letter to one of the most treasured cities on the planet. At it's worst, it's another vapid, misogynistic Woody Allen movie. The problematic director has made unbelievably good films, there's no question. But when he falls, its embarrassing, and creepy. The women in this movie have no dimension or depth. All are objects for men to deal with. Rome is a city of love, but watching this movie, it seems like a brothel. Only two of the four stories leave a gratifying impact. Roberto Benigni as the tortured celebrity is a really funny, exaggerated look at paparazzi culture. The shower taking Opera singer is a hilarious side story as well. Everything else falls apart like a stale slice of tiramisu. Italia, you deserve better.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A terrible movie!!!,"...and this is from a Woody Allen fan. I get the fact that people get famous for being famous and that Rome is a beautiful city. I now also get that either all these actors cannot act or that Mr. Allen has lost touch with writing and directing. Watch ""Midnight in Paris"",""Annie Hall"", ""Manhattan"" or ""Hannah and Her Sisters""; but don't waste your time with this film. Mr. Baldwin was good as the ""conscious for Mr. Eisenberg but the other players were either flat or overboard. If that was the point it did not play well. The story is contrived and too cutesy to be either believable or a fantasy. Even the ""little"" plot twists were very predictable. A rating of 4 is generous.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Arrivederci Roma,"""To Rome With Love"" fails, but not for lack of trying. It has its moments, but they're few and far between. Most of the running time is spent belaboring ideas that Allen has previously handled a lot better. And unlike many of Allen's films, there are several glaring examples of miscasting (Ellen Page, Jesse Eisenberg). On the plus side, viewers are treated to great location photography, a beautifully staged opera sequence, a ravishing Penelope Cruz ostensibly spewing fluent Italian, and a recurrent use of ""Amada mia, amore mio"" on the soundtrack.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Woody Allen  the  Same,"nothing surprising. but almost seductive for his fans and for a part of public who discover small slices from normal existence in his movies. only interesting detail is the role of Jesse Eisenberg, a clone of director and nice role of Jake for Alec Baldwin. only sin - it is a pure Woody Allen film. same recipes, only few different spices, same relationship web, same humor and this does it predictable in too more measure. the cast is perfect but the sound is of story is a little strange. not the script, not the director but the sensation of one Shakespeare comedy as homage to Rome can be not the best option. it is not the best, it is not the worst Woody Allen. only the same. and this is all.",,Anonymous,Music
Another European travel ad,"Don't get me wrong. I love Woody Allen and always enjoy watching his movies even if they not always his best. His genius allows him to pepper occasionally incoherent plots with enough funny moments to make them worth watching. But I wished that he would go back to the old Woody of movies such as ""Bananas"", ""Take money and run"", ""Manhattan"", ""Don't drink the water"", ""Annie Hall"" and other he had made in the past. Or even better: came up with other formula than the one he has been using in the past few years which is nothing more than series of disconnected little stories about people I don't care about and placing action in all predictable places such as Paris,Rome, London or Barcelona. I would prefer that either he finally explores USA beyond New York including older characters, or at least - moves action to more original foreign places. As it is now his choice of classic European cities makes his last movies more like tourist folders for cruises. And plot definitely would gain with less characters. The movie could be better, in my opinion if the plot had concentrated only on the clerk who became a celebrity for one day played by excellent Roberto Benigni. He was the best actor playing the most original character - sort of Buster Keaton of our times - trying hard to be a proper member of society but having too many hidden quirks which makes him a very fascinating comedic personality. He certainly was much more interesting and realistic actor than other members of the cast - all acting in the same ""Woody Allen"" manner which after seeing so much of it becomes a little tired. Not to mention that they all speak in a similar fashion which is a big mistake of any script (as a rule people talk differently). The idea of instant celebrity would be enough to build the whole movie around it as a comment on our world - a bit of reality which so often is missing in movies of the director. There is still plenty of imagination left in Woody Allen to try something completely different.",,Anonymous,Music
Just a series of scenes set in lovely Rome,"I saw a two-part documentary on Woody Allen a few months ago. At one point during the documentary, he pulls out a box filled with bits of paper and he says something to the effect that he is constantly writing ideas down on pieces of paper. From those pieces of paper he creates his scripts. I thought he meant that an idea then comes to fruition from the musings he has gathered. In To Rome with Love, it appears that he just reached his boney hand int0 the box, pulled out six or seven pieces of paper, and wrote six or seven separate little silly stories with the ideas from each.There is no plot, just a series of conversations that speak to some neurosis of Woody's that must have been bothering him when he was working on the script.There is no editing. There are no segues between scenes. Just a choppy sea that bounces us around on top of waves that randomly hit the bow.There are just a series of scenes set in lovely Rome (which made me want to visit again; I haven't been there in ten years) that have no relationship to each other, and frankly, it is Woody Allen at his laziest. I have already determined that Woody Allen is a lazy writer and director. He mentioned in an interview that he's fast and on budget because he has other things he likes to do, other interests in his life, and thus has no desire to spend more time than he has to on the set. He is notorious for giving little direction, for not providing much input to enable actors to see his vision. Actors speak of this tendency with reverence as if no direction makes him a great director. Huh? I believe his technique of inserting actors into scenes as teachers of the scene's point is lazy too. He doesn't have to show us the way to anything, he just sticks someone into the scene who has no business being there to tell us what we are supposed to surmise from the action around it. That's Alec Baldwin's job in To Rome with Love, and he does it well. And the message he's giving us is so ""Baldwin"" that you are willing to sit and nod in agreement. Juliet Taylor is also well cast. But as a woman, the entire vignette about Monica, the manipulative, deceitful, seductress of the innocent, and Jack, who never had a prayer of escaping her black widow's web, makes me furious. And I think Woody thinks that way. He's just an innocent guy who has been made out to be the bad guy by women who always planned to destroy him Enough about Woody's personal life. Back to his lazy professional life. Looking back, I've decided he was lazy in Midnight in Paris too. He brought in all kinds of literary giants from another era, but he presented them in shallow characterizations, rather than doing some homework and really having them respond as they might have to some of the questions Gil could have asked them. Instead, they just showed up and bantered in a shallow, one-liner sort of way. It could have been truly thought provoking and unique if they had responded to questions about present-day intellectual challenges.The last scene is worth the trip. ""Volare"" played by a brass and string band on the Spanish Steps is marvelous. I hummed it all the way home, much to the chagrin of my aunt and cousin, who attended the movie with me. But why not? I would have loved to have been there in the dark when they were filming it. No one around. The middle of the night. ""Volare"" wafting into the night. A little whimsy is a good thing.I may be done with Woody Allen. I have said it before, but maybe this time I mean it. Work a little harder Woody, and quit resting on your laurels. Your sharp wit and pathetic neurosis are getting as old as you apparently feel.",,Anonymous,Music
A distracted film with only a loose central focus of love in Rome,"This film is about the unusual encounters of several visitors and residents in Rome.""To Rome With Love"" retains the Woody Allen style by being very dialog heavy, despite most of it is in Italian. A few minutes into the film, we are treated with a airborne scene with a familiar Woody Allen style paranoia and anxiety. The rest of the film is quite a departure from his work. We see various individuals having to make difficult decisions in their relationships, but not in a Woody Allen style.Two of the subplots are rather ridiculous that they end up being confusing and annoying, and not entertaining or fun. The Roberto Begnini subplot makes no sense, and his over the top acting it eclipses the comedic elements. The subplot is also out of place with the rest of the film's atmosphere.For the Jesse Eisenberg subplot, it portrays his struggle against the charming Ellen Page. It is a good subplot about the challenges of love, but Alec Baldwin is always around, making comments like a ghost only visible to Jesse Eisenberg. The commentary is annoying and out of place, putting me off the subplot. For the Penelope Cruz subplot, it is funny but too short. I enjoyed it the most out of all the subplot.Overall, ""To Rome With Love"" is a film with too many subplots. It appears too distracted, with only a loose central focus of love in Rome. None of the subplots are fully engaging or fully satisfying.",,Anonymous,Music
