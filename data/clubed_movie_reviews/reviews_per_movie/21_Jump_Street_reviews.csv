"I have to be honest, I never expected to like this movie, but boy was it good.","Buddy cop movies have been losing their waves. The thing is that all the buddy cop movies after Rush Hour 1 have been either too dull to comprehend or just mildly interesting and could just pass as a movie you've seen just to mark the register that you've seen it.Based on a TV series of the same name which aired on Fox Network between 1987 and 1991, the series focuses on a squad of youthful-looking undercover police officers investigating crimes in high schools, colleges, and other teenage venues. The 2012 movie adaptation also had the former cast of the series; Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise play a minor role.Written by Jonah Hill who also starred in it, 21 is a movie that suits a cinema viewing with a box of popcorn at your side. Hill's performance was on a mild okay side, but the main cheese in the movie was Channing Tatum, who transcended from a jock to a nerd and still maintained his persona. I guess the most fun I had was when I saw Ice – Cube talking to the duo.The movie was directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs). The directors and writers made sure you didn't have to go see the original to get the full taste of 21, as the film made do of the current pop culture in our time and how ironic and dumb it looks to make a fun movie and enough juice left to make another.21 makes fun of everything in its path, even down to drugs, and how we kept expecting things to blow up and they just don't. The jokes keeps coming in from every corner making you laugh although.The high moments in the movie was whenever the duo were together, the low moment was when they were apart.The plot had the duo Hill and Tatum as Morton Schmidt and Greg Jenko (respectively), get deployed as undercover cops to a high school to bust a drug ring, and everything you'd expect to happen, doesn't. That's the fun of the movie.All in all, why are you wasting time reading this go watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Hit the heights,"21 Jump Street was a late 1980s/early 90s action based cop show featuring Johnny Depp. A department of youthful looking cops who can mingle amongst young people.The film version goes for laughs with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill playing mismatched buddies who get recruited by the newly constituted Jump Street because of their youthful looks and go undercover in High School to break a synthetic drugs gang.On paper the film does not sound much, an old forgotten TV series being revived, starring two actors who outside of the USA would not cause much of a stir, Tatum being widely regarded as Mr Wooden.However the synthetic drug must have been put in these guys coffee as both Hill and Tatum give terrific performances.Tatum shows a talent for light comedy and has signs of a personality which have up to now remained hidden.The script is consistently funny and makes you laugh, the direction is very much spot on. The film does not outstay its welcome and even better, they bag star cameos from an original 21 Jump Street member or two.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
fun movie,"Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are a couple of underperforming cops. Their Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) sends them back to high school to go undercover as students to crack a drug ring.This is an re-imagining of the 80s TV show. Unlike many others who try to remake 80s show, this one is actually funny, and joyous. They have great chemistry, and are hilarious together. Surprisingly, Channing Tatum does have some comedic chops. His timing is quite good. Jonah Hill is a great partner. Ice Cube does an intimidating Captain without losing likability. In fact, I think everybody is having a good fun time, and I think it shows.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"yeah, I was just like you","I too expected this to stink. Another buddy cop movie, starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, based on a lousy 80's television show - doesn't sound all that appealing.Hill's ""The Sitter"", completely mediocre, and it's been quite a while since Superbads success.Channing Tatum showed his comedic timing during his appearance on SNL. I was still hesitant.But, I stand corrected.This is the funniest movie since last years' Bridesmaids.The key here is the fantastic script. The story isn't rocket-science, and we knew it wouldn't be, but the comedic timing of the leads is spot-on, and they were given a great script to work with.I found myself laughing multiple times throughout. My spouse concurred. One late, unnecessary gross-out moment brought it down a notch. The film hadn't used any of those gimmicks and didn't need to in the end. It just seemed a bit out of place and distasteful.The leads did a great job here. Their characters worked exactly how they should in a buddy-cop flick like this. They bounced off each other for an hour and a half, and the result will surely be one of the best comedies of the year, and an outside shot for my 2012 top-25(back-end)if it can hold-on.Watch out for a sneaky cameo(spoiled by the cast list if you look).Nice surprise.Deserves it's ranking here.Stuck between 7-8, but going with 76/100, so I'm rounding to 8.You'll enjoy this if you liked:The Other Guys, Starsky and Hutch, If Looks Could Kill, or Blue Streak - even though I think this is actually a clear notch above all of those films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
The only thing getting blown tonight is their cover,"This movie is based on the series 21 Jump Street that went from 1987 to 1991, but this movie knows it is not going to be like the show along with it referencing it. I thought 21 Jump Street (2012) was a very funny movie that made me laugh from beginning to end.Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill were incredibly good in the movie, I liked their characters, and I liked seeing their friendship with each other. They were very funny, and I thought they also did action scenes well, plus Ice Cube in this was also very funny when he is talking to Channing Tatum's and Jonah Hill's characters about doing their jobs, with Dave Franco who was also funny.The movie makes fun about police officer cliches from movies or shows, the show it is based on, and the main characters age when blending into high school. The action scenes and/or chase scenes were fun, funny, and entertaining to watch when they tend to happen during weird scenarios.It has a funny abrupt ending, and the movie has a message in there about people who are addicted to drugs. 21 Jump Street (2012) was a fun, funny, and entertaining movie where people will have fun and all and all an enjoyable time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Touche...,"Precursor: I just moved back into town two days ago and had made plans to see one of my old friends tonight. I did not want to see this movie, and wouldn't have under any other circumstances but my friend really wanted to and the tickets were free so I went.Review itself: This is of no disrespect to Jonah Hill, his fashion of humor or his fans at all, but I, personally have grown tired of what seems to now be a plethora of wanna be Hangover and Superbad's. (The success of Project X seriously worries me...). Anyways, having that mind set approaching tonight and considering the fact I didn't laugh once during the 21 JS trailer, green or red band... I really wasn't expecting all that much out of the experience aside from leaving the house and catching up with a buddy.But damn.I honestly thought this movie was great. Yes, there were parts I wasn't fond of... a bit of the dialogue seemed to me to be vulgar strictly for the sake of being vulgar... there was the usual expected Jonah Hill trademarked myriad of penis jokes and one extremely unnecessary shock gag but the majority of the movie was, to me, surprisingly satirical/smart/relevant in today's society, self-aware, and situationally hilarious. Even the dumbest and most profane of this movie's jokes and clichés seemed to know that they were such and were given the proper comedic build up/context to at least warrant a chuckle. This movie had some surprisingly clever dialogue throughout and some of the best supporting characters I've seen in recent comedies (Ice Cube, The Principal, etc..) What really stood out to me though was the editing. 21 Jump Street features some of the most awkwardly humorous camera shot transitions, scene changes and music integration. Despite it's faults, I found this to be a damn hard movie to hate, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun weekend movie.All in all... genuine, clever, vulgar yet respectable comedy with some heart.IMO a very good career move for both Hill and Tatum.Stoked for the sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Still funny 12 years later.,"I watched it when it first came out and remembered liking it, but it was time to give it a re-watch to see if it's still holding up. And it really does! I am pretty tired of Hollywood trying to make money by reviving old franchises (which this movie pokes fun at in some parts actually) but this was a well done example of that. Sure, it's still more entertainment than believable story/plot but the funny writing and great delivery by Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are good enough to make you forget about it for.1h45.

Best Comedy so far of 2012,"So if you like Jonah Hill and comedies with really great cameo appearances, I think you would definitely like this film.I must admit I expected this to be at the same standard as maybe The Change-Up or The Hangover Part II which weren't terrible movies, but they weren't the funniest movies I have seen either. This movie is more on par with The Hangover (the first installment), Superbad and Anchorman.The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is brilliant, and it's nice to see Tatum in something other than his standard rom-com or ""rom"" setting. I was already laughing from the first scene, which is generally hard to do and the humour was the correct balance of wit and slapstick. There were actually a lot more clever jokes than I expected and there were some scenes were I couldn't even control my laughter in a full cinema.All in all, I'm not saying this movie is for everyone but the way I would tell you to see it is if you like Jonah Hill's ridiculous dialogue with sometimes unnecessary swears and you have no expectations of it being anything like the original TV show, I would definitely recommend this one! Best comedy film I've seen at the cinema in 2012.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Funniest Movie I've Seen In a While,"I have never seen the original 21 Jump Street series so I can't compare. I had only watched the trailer and thought it looked alright, but wasn't planning on paying to see it. I received free advance screening passes to see it last night and I am so glad! It is honestly the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. I usually don't laugh out loud but this movie had me (and the rest of the audience) laughing at least every ten seconds.Who knew Channing Tatum could be so funny? He really steals the show half the movie with his great comedic timing. The back-and-forth that he and Jonah Hill have is so refreshing. They have clear comedic chemistry and play off of each other very well. The dialogue is fresh and hilarious. Another standout actor was Dave Franco. I am a big fan of him and have always found him funny, and he really shines in this movie. Overall, every actor played off the next very well. It's clear they had a great time making this movie.I can't recommend this enough. If you want a good laugh, then SEE THIS. It has clever, outrageous comedy and some great acting. There was a great cameo surprise towards the end that had the entire theater gasping and laughing. This is one of the few movie experiences I've had where the entire audience enjoyed themselves and laughed out loud, even clapped at some parts. Go see it, you will not regret it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
21 Jump Street - Laughing along with you,"This is basically a film version of an 80's TV series that kick started Johnny Depp's career. It's about two rubbish cops (Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum) going into a police program to pretend to be in high school so to infiltrate a drugs ring that's killed a kid in the school.NOW STOP, no not hammertime but don't worry. I know that sounds like a very rubbish stupid comedy film but very early on makes you realise it knows its stupid when the guy in charge of the operation explains something about the program to the two cops, I quote ""a revived undercover program from the '80s, revamped for modern times; the people who make these things up are old and out of ideas, so they try updating (stuff) like this and hope we don't notice"". See now that line shows you that it realises its no top notch film and that it is just in it for the ride with a few laughs.First and foremost yes it is funny, which is a relief as about 3/4 of films that label themselves ""comedy"" really just arn't. It has some pretty silly gags sometimes but these are outweighed by the tonnes of good jokes and are really insignificant in comparison to 1 or 2 of the fantastic lines in the film. The film isn't too plot heavy which is good as it adds realism to the pair and allows them to branch out to allow some story with the side characters, which stops too many sight gags and fart jokes being used as filler.Looking at Channing Tatum's IMDb page (I don't think I've seen many of his films) he seems to be in mainly rom-coms and what are essentially girly movies. In this though he is really quite good, he doesn't overplay his character which may be due to him coming from a more straight up film background. The way he delivers his lines isn't cheesy and he gives his character a realistic portrayal while still being hilarious at times. Jonah Hill is Jonah Hill which doesn't need any more on it and the side characters and pretty funny with a good cameo right at the end.It has that problem all Hollywood comedy's have of having a sad bit 3/4 the way through the film, which by the way one of my favourite comedies - pineapple express - does not, but I can't really bring it down too much for as it's probably forced to include it by the company behind the film. It's also a touch long but neither of these things take away from what is a good self-mickey-taking comedy film.7/10. Good laughs from some of the leaders of the current generation of comedy",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Nice Comedic Remake of Original,"21 Jumpstreet is rehashed as a comedy and it worked!? Go figure. There are not many remakes that are good in any respect, so for 21 Jumpstreet to be done again and done as a comedy no less was a real win.This movie had excellent writers. Jonah Hill is a funny guy anyway so I expected a reasonable performance from him but there were good performances all around. I think the movie did well to poke fun at itself along the way, it provided some genuinely funny moments.The movie did fall into predictability towards the end. More accurately, the movie fell into a cliché ending. It seemed that the writers may have run out of steam. Even with that, the movie was funny enough and Ice Cube didn't wreck it with his terrible acting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Unexpectedly hilarious and clever. 21 Jump Street subverts all expectations.,"21 Jump Street sounds like a terrible idea on paper: a big screen adaptation of an ABC TV series from the 80s. Was anyone really clamoring for that? Was there any reason to adapt that into a feature film in 2012? It sounds like just another example of Hollywood cashing in on an established franchise, akin to the decision to make a movie based on the board game Battleship. As it turns out 21 Jump Street is barely an adaptation, and it isn't just an excuse to capitalize on an old concept. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the team behind the brilliant and absurd Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, use the fact that nobody is too invested in the source material to their advantage, subverting all expectations for what a movie like this would be. The result is a smart, exciting and often hilarious action-comedy with real stakes and a surprising amount of heart.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum star as Schmidt and Jenko respectively, two rookie cops who went to high school together, though belonging to different social circles. Jenko was the popular jock while Schmidt was the unpopular nerd. When they realize each has something the other one needs, a friendship sparks and they become partners. After a failed drug bust, they're reassigned to a special division when their police station decides to ""revive a cancelled program from the 80s"" (get it?). They're sent to a local high school undercover as students to investigate and bring down a drug ring. Despite identical titles, I don't know if we can even call this an adaptation of the show. While the TV show was primarily a drama, the film is essentially a satire of movies and shows like 21 Jump Street, fully aware of all of the clichés of its genre.Writer Michael Bacall (Scott Pilgrim vs. The World) seems to have realized nobody really cared about a 21 Jump Street movie and instead decided to make something totally different. Early on, in a scene of dialogue that may as well have been delivered directly into the camera, a character explains that there aren't any original ideas these days and so we're stuck rehashing old concepts from the 80s to make a quick buck. In this way and many others, the movie is all about subverting your expectations, which based on this premise are probably very low. It's anything but a lazy cash grab, taking everything you know about buddy cop films and turning it on its head. It embraces the stupidity of its concept too, by constantly acknowledging that Hill and Tatum are way too old to be posing as high school kids, or by having Ice Cube play the stereotypical black police captain from every 80s movie ever, and then outright acknowledging that. In a hilarious early scene Schmidt and Jenko's roles are reversed, with the jock forced to pose as the nerd and the nerd posing as the jock. 21 Jump Street thrives on the unexpected.Many were initially unsure how Channing Tatum would perform, as he is an actor who has never headlined in any major comedies before. While Jonah Hill is without a doubt the star, having had tons of experience in films like Superbad and Knocked Up, Tatum does a fine job as well and the two actors have great chemistry together. In movies like this with two main leads, the rapport between them can make or break the film. With 21 Jump Street, it absolutely makes it.That's ultimately why the movie works as well as it does. Any successful comedy needs real stakes. Otherwise, it just feels like a series of Saturday Night Live sketches with no real purpose. A few years ago, Superbad was extremely successful not just for being a goofy and raunchy comedy, but also for having a believable high school friendship at its core. Similarly, 21 Jump Street works because the friendship between its protagonists feels real, and as a result there are real emotional stakes to go along with the satire. Driving this silly, raunchy comedy is a truly interesting story about popularity and friendship in high school, and about how you might act differently if you could go back as an adult. It's easily the funniest comedy in well over a year, but it's not just a vehicle for jokes: 21 Jump Street tells a great story, too.Phil Lord and Chris Miller seem to love surprising us. As with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, 21 Jump Street is a movie nobody expected to be great. Its brilliance lies in the fact that it knows all of your complaints ahead of time. Think it sounds like a cheap cash crab based on an 80s property? They make a joke about that. Think Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are too old to play high school kids? They make a joke about that too. It's extremely clever and always two steps ahead of the audience. But what really stands out about 21 Jump Street is that it's not just an enjoyable and hilarious time at the theater, it also tells a genuinely interesting and emotionally compelling story, developing its characters in a way you probably wouldn't anticipate from a raunchy high school comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Wonderfully Kitschy,"This movie... I went into it thinking it would be like every other buddy cop movie I've ever see. And it was. But that's the beauty of it. It fully leans into the fact that comedy buddy cop movies have become something of a trope. It IS tropey and somehow subverts those tropes at the same time. It's profane and violent but I had a GREAT time watching it. Sometimes, all you need is a little slapstick comedy and an in-your-face, half-assed message.Delightful.

Fun In High School,"The TV series of 21 Jump Street is always remembered as one of Johnny Depp's early performances. The concept is a bit interesting. At first glance, this movie looks like it's just another mediocre raucous comedy, but it turns out to be a clever one. It's quite a surprise. It stays loyal to its roots except it added some raunchiness and slapstick humor to the story. It's a new kind of 21 Jump Street that is much more fun.I'm not saying it's better than the TV series though. Both are pretty interesting but this one is definitely aiming as a comedy. The film is just crazy stuff with crazy characters living in an absurd setting. The original premise remains but with some buddy comedy elements, and raunchy and slapstick humor. Surprisingly, it works better to the plot. The humor is clever and quite hilarious. These jokes are greatly executed by the stars. Jonah Hill is always a brilliant comedian. Channing Tatum finally plays a none bland character. His chemistry with Hill shines to the film. While the others, Ice Cube hams it up a little but he can provide some laughs. Rob Riggle is just being Rob Riggle. Dave Franco's role here kind of reminds me of his role in Fright Night but he's pretty good with it.The direction is snappy and stylish. The action is fun but I don't think anybody cares about that. The main point of this film is High School and the relationship between Schmidt and Jenko. It shows how the new high school turned their lives upside down. They can't stop playing with their antics on their mission. There is a drama between them. Most of it played as a joke but the heart is always there.All turns out to be pretty well in this film even with all the changes and the absurdity. It's smart, sweet, hilarious, and fun. The fans of the TV series may still get a surprise while they miss the none mad Captain Jenko and the charms of the show. This film is too crazy and absurd but in a clever way. I haven't enjoyed a comedy like this in a while. 21 Jump Street is undeniably fun and it's probably one of the best comedies of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"A Lot More Entertaining Than I Expected, Very Laugh Out Loud Funny","I don't know if you'd say I was lucky enough, but I did get the chance to see this tonight in a special screening. It's the kind of movie I looked at while watching the trailers and asked 'Why?'. And seeing it at the screening for free is probably the only way I would go. But, to my surprise, the movie is pretty damn funny. Certainly it's a bit inexplicable in many areas. But if you forget a lot of the logic leaps, the situations are funny. The attempt to be different and poke fun at clichés is pretty obvious, but none the less there are many funny moments.As I said, there are issues with the logic of the film. Right off the bat we meet our two main characters, polar opposites in high school, Channing Tatum's character being the popular jock who makes fun of Jonah Hill's character, the dork. They're fairly clichéd as far as HS stereotypes go, but this actually feeds into the film later when we see those clichés destroyed by today's often indescribable cliques. Somehow, both of these guys end up as cops, something that initially seemed puzzling to me, since neither of them seem like they would want to be cops. But really, it's just an excuse to get on with the jokes, so it's easily overlooked. Soon, our fumbling duo is sent into high school as undercover cops to take down a new drug being passed around. Really, this story is nothing more than an excuse to make jokes about clichéd situations, but surprisingly the jokes are pretty funny. Clichés are definitely broken. The cool kids at school aren't jocks, but socially conscious teens who care about the environment. In fact, the entire social spectrum is flipped upside down.There are some fairly funny moments. Highlights include the visions induced by a high Jonah Hill and a highway chase in which nothing goes as expected. Sadly, the film isn't particularly memorable. It's funny enough, and the humor is well written, but the actors are what you'd expect them to be. Jonah Hill is Jonah Hill here, and Channing Tatum, while surprisingly funny, is still Channing Tatum. My favorite is actually Ice Cube, who appears as the Lt. in charge of the Jump Street operation. He's funny as the angry chief, and they do in fact call this out, though it seems a bit forced. None the less, it's been a while since Ice Cube made an appearance, and he's pretty funny here. The rest of the cast is decent, though none really as memorable as Cube, or even Hill and Tatum for that matter.The writing is mostly to blame here. The story is weak, weak enough to bring a lot of the rest of the film down. The film requires a huge suspension of disbelief and you can't help but wonder if everyone in the film is an idiot for overlooking so many numerous coincidences. They sure do talk about how Tatum looks too old for high school, and yet not one person thinks that maybe he IS too old for high school? Other leaps in logic make you wonder how stupid the film can get, but again, it really isn't about the story, it's about the jokes. In fact, that's really the only reason that this is getting a 7. Even if I don't want to admit it, I did laugh quite a bit at this film. Tatum and Hill have great chemistry and the humor bounces between them very well. I AM fairly tired of Hill's comedy schtick, but combined with the poking fun of clichés and even at the film itself, it's a pretty consistently funny movie. Heck, there's even a cameo that almost makes it worthwhile, though I am sure you can probably guess what that is.With so many films coming out that really are nothing to write home about, 21 Jump Street isn't a bad way to kill time at the theater. It's certainly funnier than I expected. Not a great film, but a funny one and maybe worth your time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
School. Guns. Cameos. Exploding chickens.,"You would not believe it even if you saw it with your own eyes. A sober Irishman? A thin Greek? A game-sealing shot by Lebron in the fourth? Even rarerit's a half-decent reboot! A reimagining of the more serious 1980s young adult crime drama of the same name, 21 Jump Street lends a comedic touch to the otherwise dreary world of underground drug trafficking. Starring an odd couple with a difference in Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, the film mostly follows the standard buddy-cop formula but deviates enough to both keep your interest and produce a handful of laughs.Seven years ago, two kids on opposite ends of the social spectrum graduated from high school. The popular Jenko (actor's name omitted for obviousness) and overweight, nerdy Schmidt (same here) both enrol in the local police force and form a friendship, helping each other pass the course. Now fully-fledged police officers, the clueless duo are kicked out of the force and into a top-secret program, where younger-looking officers are again enrolled in high school in order to bring down a syndicated drug ring.By a long margin, the film's best quality is its willingness to make fun of itself. Granted, the backbone of the plot is predictable enough, but gag-wise, this movie has its moments. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs) take pleasure in playing off cemented audience expectations (that is, a few laughs, a gunfight or two and a couple of explosions) before even the first trailer has begun, and subsequently subverting these conventions wherever they see fit.Essentially, they refuse to play by the rules, which can be comedy gold when used correctly. A rogue motorbike spitting sparks across the freeway collides with an oil tanker and nothing happens. That same bike runs into a pickup truck carrying a load of chickens and a deafening explosion ensues. The irony of having a man who once made a generous living badmouthing authority play a typically surly, by-the-book cop isn't lost on most, and it is Ice Cube's sheer assertion of himself as a stereotype that makes the role work. The cameos by a couple of members of the original series are good fun too.Speaking of making roles work, Hill reverts back to his Superbad roots with his performance, but it is Tatum who is surprisingly funny as the dim-witted do-gooder Jenko. Just when it looks like he has become irreversibly typecast as either an action hero or soppy teen idol, he comes up big in a comedy, impressing with his stone-faced delivery and interplay with his far more comedically experienced co-star. While under the influence in a certain scene, Tatum utters the film's funniest one-liner, and a quote sure to be repeated in many a school and university from now on.That said, it is the physical aspect of the comedy that outdoes the script here, and while that is no criticism of the stunt work or set pieces, a lack of somewhat more layered humour leaves the film feeling hollow; failing to live up to its full potential. The opening act is particularly burdensome. Apart from a couple of laughs during the attempted arrest of some bikers in a public park, the film proceeds to drag its feet, vainly looking for ways to intertwine jokes with storytelling until the pair are shipped off to Jump Street.Other parts of the film still feel done to death, again a mark against the film's reluctance to go all-out in an effort to produce something truly original. It could have done without the love interest for the loser, made all the more disconcerting as it is a love between a high schooler and a grown man. Although Schmidt and Jenko start off as friends, their falling out/moment of clarity/reconciliation can be seen coming a mile away, occurring too late in the film and needlessly slowing down the second half. Yet, if you're expecting an utter disaster, like this particular viewer was, you might just leave surprised.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.

This is an extremely hilarious movie. Would 100% Recommend!,"21 Jump Street is an amazing comedy. I understand that it is based off of the late 1980's- 90's TV series of the same name, but I doubt the original was as funny as this remake. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have this amazing on screen chemistry that give audiences a genuine feel for their characters' relationship, and the jokes they get together are just top- notch. The idea of two buddy cops, one smart and awkward and the other handsome, strong and dim may not be an original one, but definitely adds to the film's appeal. Ice Cube as the angry police captain is a riot, and is guaranteed to get anyone busting their gut (especially the Korean Jesus joke). If you are looking for an original story, with deep drama, intrigue, and mystery then don't watch this movie. This is purely a smart and quick- witted spoof comedy, and it is probably the best in the genre. If you are looking for a great time, and just want to relax, sit down, and laugh your ass off, then this is must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Finds a nice ground between entertaining and hysterical,"On the surface, this movie looks like it would be somewhat mediocre. But it's actually pretty damn good. When you're not laughing your pants off (and believe me, you will be), you'll have no problem being just plain entertained by it's ability to just have fun. It does a great job of not only avoiding giant cliché's, but making fun of them in the process. Jonah Hill will have you laughing, and Channing Tatum actually did a good job in this movie.......not surprising seeing that the role called for him to be a douche bag.

Watch it even if you're not a fan of the TV show.,21 Jump Street is easy enough to appeal to folks new to the material but it lacks the punches of a pure R rated film(this one is PG). Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play opposite personalities in that Hill is a geek and Tatum is a stud- who are assigned as partners as they go undercover at a high school to find some drug activities that lead to something bigger. There are enough laughs and yes- Depp has a cameo which should excite older fans and the film is basically a satire of the 80s in many ways. If you want a good film to sit down with for a throwback to the 80s than 21 Jump Street should be a great option. 7,,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Fantastic Script Helps Remake Work,"What is the best way to rejuvenate a rehashed television series from the 1980s? Bring in some writers that have the craft and skill to make fun of their project. This movie is sprinkled with Easter Eggs for the keen observer. From the original show in the background of a gunfight to the Captain complaining about how people don't notice when you give them pretty much the same thing but call it something different.By being able to make fun of itself, this movie gets off on the right foot. With Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill in the lead, this movie is very entertaining. The development of the storyline shows that the writer has skill—and that the actors do well with what they've been given. Channing Tatum has always felt a little lacking in the acting skills. Although that is still slightly a problem, it is covered up with a good script. Jonah Hill—ever since Moneyball—will never have to prove his value as an actor again.The shortfalls of this movie are all grouped together in the final half hour. Although I respect Michael Becall as screenwriter, it appears his has neither the skills nor the wherewithal to say no to producers or the studio. Everything good that filled this movie was erased by the typical Hollywood ending. For the love of god—they even alluded to a sequel. Why does the Hollywood ideal of a ""happy ending"" have to destroy so many movies?I have to mention the epic cameo by Johnny Depp. Although it is unlikely to beat out the Bill Murray Cameo from Zombieland, it is one of the best that I have seen. Placing Johnny Depp back into a role he hasn't played in two decades is the perfect way to please the fans while adding a strange new element to the movie. 21 Jump Street may be worth the money just for this cameo.21 Jump Street is absolutely worth the money. You will genuinely enjoy the opening hour and half of this movie. Although it is thoroughly destroyed in the final half hour, it is not enough to take away from the skilled writing and acting that takes place. Your best bet is to go see this movie, then send a letter to Michael Becall to tell him to stand up for his scripts.reillyreviews.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Well written, good characters","This is an action-filled, funny movie. Jenko, who was a jock in high school and Brad who was a nerd, both meet in the police academy and become best friends and partners. As their undercover journey begins, they are sent back to high school to find the source of a drug that is going viral. Through this movie there are twists, high points, and low points. The characters are reliving their high school senior year again. They see many social changes and learn to adapt, all while trying to keep their cover.

Definitely a great comedy.,"This never had been a movie people were expecting lots of great things off. However the closer it came to its release date the bigger the buzz about it got, that it actually was going to be a pretty great and hilarious movie. And it is a surprisingly good movie but it also definitely is not without its flaws and weaknesses as well.I was honestly really loving the movie for its first 30 minutes or so. The comedy was great and the movie genuinely made me laugh. What I loved about it was that it was being build up and treated almost like a serious movie, even while the events and characters themselves were being pretty silly. It's not the same sort of lame and childish comedy you are accustomed to seeing, in modern day comedies. It's refreshing that the movie is taking its own approach to its comedy and is also doing some unexpected and original stuff with it at times.The story and its concept were also definitely likable aspects about this movie. Having two cops going undercover at an high school of course gives the writers plenty of room and opportunity to come up with lots of comical situations. But what is good about it is that its script is cleverly avoiding all of the clichés and the story still mostly works out as a surprise, though the story of course never really becomes the most important aspect of the movie.It's also all really about its two main characters and their dynamics. Even all of the Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum haters will be able to laugh and like them, in this particular movie. They handle all of the comedy well and suit their roles. It's funny how Channing Tatum seems to have far more range and charisma in a comedy, as opposed to in a more serious role. I would definitely urge him to do more comedies in the near future, since he seems to be really comfortable- and has a true talent for the genre. I also feel I should mention Ice Cube, who was greatly hilarious, in a small role.But it's not like the whole movie is just a great and hilarious one to watch. Its middle part was not bad but it was definitely lacking. The first part of the movie had so much pace to it but the movie slows down a bit too much in the middle, which also makes the movie feel a bit overlong. Really, the movie would had been a better one if it was 15 minutes shorter or if it had maintained its good and quick pace, throughout the entire movie its duration.It's still a great comedy, that will make you laugh and I can certainly guarantee you that. It just has some weaker and slower moments in it as well, which just prevents me from calling this movie an absolute must-see.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Best movie ever,This was a really funny video. I would recommend you see it if you haven't because you will laugh a lot. I would also recommend their sequel to the movie which is called 22 jump street. If you have younger children I would not watch this movie when they are up or even around. It is really funny because they chose to of the funniest people that are actors. I love how they chose Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum to play in this movie. I also love how they put them in two different groups when they go to school. I have seen this movie so many times and I love watching it every single time that I have watched it. I have not seen 22 jump street yet but I am hoping to soon.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Yes its good and full of funny!,"No way am I saying who turns up in cameos during this surprisingly very funny and cool reworking of the famed 80's television show. Channing Tatum is on a roll after 'The Vow' while 'Jonah Hill' is on another type of roll after his Oscar Nomination. Both are a fantastic duo of young looking policeman who go undercover to a high school to track down a supplier of a new synthetic drug frequently used by the students. The film has little decorum kicking into gear within minutes and not really slowing down. The little things in the boys comic routine is what works best, their one liners, banter with Ice Cube and the quips referring to high schoolers. Forget the script, this is just fun action fluff better than 'Project X' and 'This Means War' put together. Excellent soundtrack too and Brie Larson backs up her coolness she displayed in the best unknown movie ever; JUST PECK. The original TV theme gets a run during the final credits.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
One of the best comedies of this decade,"When I first saw the trailer of 21 Jump Street I kinda had this feeling that there might be something into this movie, even though, I was mostly unimpressed with previous Jonah Hill's movies, but Channing Tatum in a comedy genre made me curious. I was definitely impressed.I started watching movie just before one of my final exams at Uni just to get the edge off, so I wasn't so much in a ""relaxed"" mood, but this movie made my day. Jokes were funny and even if they were cliché they still looked original and fresh. I think main actors made a great duo between raw awkwardness from Hill and a fresh side and decent effort from Tatum. Rest of the cast was also OK, but the best features of this movie is not the actor play, it's the script, editing and just that feeling you get out from it. It's exactly what comedy should be - making you laugh no matter what.The plot is easy on the viewer. It contains some drama, some action and , of course, some comedy, but everything is kept light and you can focus on every scene individually. Even if you did not like last hits of comedy like Hangover, Pineapple Express or Superbad, you WILL enjoy this movie.Some people might find the ending a bit off (I guess I did too), but the first 60 minutes were so good and made me laugh so many times, that I was forced to give it 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
stupidity has the natural force to repeat it again and again,"i had to push myself up out of the seat and walked out the cinema. this movie was so disgustingly bad and i thought if i kept watching it, my i.q. level might suffer one more untreatable damage. since i got the experiences again and again when i forced myself to sit through the whole lousy movies, i always felt that i got certain brain damages afterward, i've got to escape asap this time. i don't know why this movie got so much hyped praises similar to 'the hunger game'. both are so stupid, absurd and ridiculously shallow. these kind of movies are for the teenagers who take ridiculousness as funny, bad farce as comedy, exaggeration performances as good acting, stupid plot and dialog as hilarious. no wonder the world's economy got more problems than ever.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Surprisingly enjoyable,"At some point Hollywood is going to run out of 80's movies or TV shows to remake. I often wonder what will happen when they have all gone twice around the track? Third time's the charm? Let's hope not, this has to end at some point, doesn't it?It was with this feeling that I cautiously approached the latest 80s remake. This time it was the turn of 21 Jump Street, apparently a popular US TV show from 1987, which famously gave Johnny Depp his big break, but strangely I don't recall ever seeing it growing up. This time around we see Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum), playing an ex-high school nerd and jock, who are forced into an unlikely pairing after enrolling in Police Academy and using their combination of brawn and brains to get through basic training. After an enthusiastic and somewhat optimistic drugs bust goes amusingly array the two are shipped out to 21 Jump Street, an undercover unit run by Captain Dickson (Ice Cube), set up to infiltrate high school drug networks.It is here that the film and indeed the Hill and Tatum double act finds its feet. High school has clearly changed since these two last attended. Schmidt and Jenko are still at opposite ends of the high school cool spectrum but this time there is some role reversal. Grades and the environment are the new barometers of cool, so Schmidt gets to experience the kind of high school experience he always dreamt of, whilst Jenko's quickly turns into nightmare. Can Schmidt and Jenko manage to bridge the social divide in the name of law enforcement?I genuinely liked 21 Jump Street. Apparently it only bears a passing resemblance to the 80s show, which maybe is why it stands up so well on its own? Hill and Tatum worked well together and both seemed completely at ease as a double act. They deliver the requisite six laughs for a comedy before the first half hour is done. The following hour is well paced, entertaining and really quite watchable. Who knew Tatumn could crack a joke as well as bust a move? Probably not even him. The supporting cast are universally good, with a standout performance from an angry Ice Cube. Its good to have him back in an angry role for a change. There is also a notable cameo or two worth keeping your eyes peeled for.Hill and Tatum are both at similar stages in their career. They are making commercially and occasionally critically successful films, but you get the feeling they are both still some distance from being able to carry a film on their own. The decision to team them up and share the load was a sensible one. Whilst it is no Starsky and Hutch, 21 Jump Street is head and shoulders above some of the turgid 80s remakes we have been subjected to recently and significantly better than some of the tired frat boy films which have been churned out of late.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Great Movie,"I have never seen or heard of the original 21 Jump Street so I cannot comment on whether this sticks to that series. However, I think this movie is great and I recommend it for teenagers and adults. The humor overall is pretty good and had everybody in the theater laughing. Sometimes the story came off as highly unrealistic, but the entertainment value more than made up for it.Both of the main actors were good in this and they played off of each other perfectly.I'll probably go to this movie again when it comes to the cheap theaters or the drive-in. It was that much fun to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Wins By Not Taking Itself Too Seriously,"I enjoyed the tv show when I was younger but never really thought of it as having big screen potential.However it clearly does, largely due to the performance of Jonah Hill and the many moments of good humour.Wisely chooses not to focus on the drama aspects or the plot, rather spending time with the charismatic characters, especially those of Ice Cube.Its good for a laugh :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Worth Your Time,"'21 Jump Street' is a largely forgotten late 80s/early 90s television show, which today is widely acknowledged for helping launch the career of actor Johnny Depp, who you made of heard of. Having not seen a single episode of the program (which was before my time), could I make it through this film with a complete understanding without any backstory?Let me get one thing straight: unlike the show (which deals with such heavy issues as child abuse, homophobia, AIDS, and hat crimes), this is a raunchy comedy. And the movie's not afraid to admit it, as the first ten minutes alone provide us with a galore of genitalia and gross out gags. Normally, these would scare me away and become a liability when considering how one movie would score. Maybe it's the fact that the funniest moments stem from witty banter or creative sequences rather than gross out themselves, but it the raunchiness didn't seem to bother me (for the most part.)Then there's Channing Tatum. If you were to bring his name up anytime before this year, I would shutter.I mean, we all know he might not have the greatest resume ('Fighting' anyone?), but he's honestly one of the best things about this movie. So much so that he even manages to be better than Jonah Hill, one of the best comedic actors working today. Rob Riggle and Ice Cube each provide inspired supporting roles that are nearly laugh out loud funny each time they're on screen, never feeling forced or overused.Does the film have problems? Well...yeah. I won't deny that. Some of the jokes fall flat, while some jokes that initially worked are stretched a little too far. There's the (inevitably) love story between one of the main characters and a high school girl feels too forced and only is there to serve as a 'love story.' But, for the most part, I completely enjoyed it, though I can't ever see myself taking time to watch it again.So if turning a serious-themed show like '21 Jump Street' into a very good raunchy comedy does make me wonder if other old 80s TV shows would make a similar transition. Wouldn't Alf as a pot-smoking, potty-mouthed slacker who still lives with his mom in modern day Los Angeles be an instant classic?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Should Be Rated R-14,"That's my new designation for movies restricted to young minds under the age of 14. ""21 Jump Street"" is one of the most sophomoric, inept movies I have seen in a long while. The screenplay was almost incoherent and the script was loaded with as many obscenities and vulgarities as you can find in a 112 minute picture, presumably to substitute for actual dialogue and humor.You know what? I never learn. I keep attending current movies after reading some reviews on our website, and more often than not I am bitterly disappointed. If culture and the arts are cyclical and a series of peaks and valleys, we are now in the deepest valley in history. The NY times Book Review section is thinner than ever, no one writes operas or any other kind of good music, modern architecture is an aesthetic wasteland and motion pictures are worse than ever.And so, I think this old fuddy-duddy will stick to the Turner Classic Movie station and FMC from now on and wait for an artistic upswing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

OK, so here's the run down. Jenko and Schmidt are being transferred to a reopened division of an 80's undercover operation. When I heard the word reopened, I was happy. Their job was to take down a drug operation inside of a high school. With loads of comedy, action, and a few explosions, it made for a great movie. Tatum and Hill did an excellent job in their parts and Ice Cube, well, he was perfect for his part. There was also a surprise cameo in the movie too and people went crazy for him as the theater erupted in applause. The only problem I had with the movie was there were a lot of raunchy jokes.

Not simple nor too sentimental,"Though the second one is a bit of a guess, since I have never seen any episode of the original TV Series. But this one is really trying to do something new. With the same name (or title if you will), but with a really hard R rating. Not sure if there will be an unrated version, but I guess they'll do that too. Even so, the movie was successful enough to warrant us a sequel. I doubt that Jonah Hill or Channing Tatum would be up for a TV show.Then again, they could replace them or bring new characters into it and make a running series out of it. Question would be, what TV channel they'd go? HBO or something similar or the PG route? But that's speculating, back to this movie, that might have been another reason GI Joe 2 got pushed back. Channing Tatum seems to be on a hot streak right now. His female and male(?) fans would say it's long overdue I guess.

Hilarious At Times; Great Cast,"21 Jump Street (2012)*** (out of 4)Reboot of the 80s TV series features Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum playing cops who go undercover in high school to try and discover who's passing around a new drug that has already killed one kid. When there the once dork Hill finds himself popular while the once popular Tatum finds himself with the losers as they try to track the drugs. I will admit that I never watched the original series so I'm not even going to try to compare them but I did find this movie to be hilarious at times and quite often very clever in its attempt to show some homages as well as spoofs. I think the film works so well because the two leads actors are simply so good in their roles. It also doesn't hurt that the two of them can work so well together and can play off one another and really take a joke and run with it. There are some hilarious bits here including a few running scenes with a motorcycle gang, which are just hilarious. Once again it's scenes like these where the screenplay really shows how clever it is because you expect certain things to happen yet they don't and the film can't wink at you for it. I thought the character development was also pretty good for this type of film as both cops really go through some ups and downs and it doesn't add up to melodrama but instead some nice growth for them. Of course, people aren't coming here for drama and thankfully this is left to just a few scenes. The rest of the film is 100% comedy and I'd say for the most part the jokes work. We get some silly laughs, some gross-out humor and just about every other type of humor you can think of. The screenplay goes all out in regards to how it gets the laughs as it really doesn't care how to do it as long as they come. I'd say that a good 80% of the jokes work very well and those that don't still aren't too bad. The one negative thing is that the film goes on way too long as we start to get dragged down in a few too many scenes that are just pushing away the obvious ending. With that said, the movie works extremely well thanks to the two leads but the cameo also works to perfection.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Silly comedy, not as funny as you think","I'll admit, I was a little disappointed in this movie right here. I went to the theater with hopes high ready to laugh myself silly, figuring that I was sure to judging by the look of the trailers I had seen. However, instead of a gut-busting comedy, what I got was a silly little movie that got old relatively quickly, and wore out it's welcome sooner than I thought it would.Don't get me wrong, 21 Jump Street delivers a few hilarious sequences. The Peter Pan play sequence, for instance, had me laughing harder than I've laughed during a movie since last years 50/50. And the party that the two bumbling cops throw is a pretty funny, entertaining part. But really, aside from a few one-liners and quips here and there, this movie offers up nothing original and is overloaded with clichés. For example, a loud, angry black cop. A scary, villainous motorcycle gang. An overbearing and slightly gay-tinged gym teacher. Yep, just about every comedy cliché can be found in this one.What this movie does have going for it is Jonah Hill. The funny man never seems to disappoint, and in this one plays the dweebie Morton Schmidt to perfection. Channing Tatum isn't bad as his counterpart, and the two show decent chemistry on screen. Also, watch out for a movie-stealing cameo towards the end from someone we all know and love (myself especially).All in all, this film does not live up to the hype. It is a funny ride through a decent storyline, but not much more. Don't go in expecting your gut to bust, as you will be very disappointed. Go in with an open mind and you will be entertained, as this is an entertaining film with some genuinely hilarious moments.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"""Where do we report to?  Down on Jump Street. 37 Jump Street... wait, that doesn't sound right.""","What is up with the directors of animated films directing live-action films? Not that I have something against it. Their films are even better than the works of live-action film directors, working for years in the business. Brad Bird showed us that the Mission Impossible hasn't lost its spark after the brilliant third installment and gave us one of the best films in the Mission Impossible franchise. Now the directors of an animated hit Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Phil Lord and Chris Miller made one the best comedies ever and surely the best comedy of 2012. I have never seen the original series this film is based on but that didn't stop me any less from fully appreciating this comedy.The whole film stands on the genius script written by Michael Baccall (I'm sure that Jonah Hill did not just collaborate on the story that he worked on the script too) the co-writer of the marvelously amazing Scott Pilgrim vs The World. The film makes fun and pays tribute to all those clichés of buddy cop movies and a lot of action films. One of the funniest scenes making fun of action films is the wonderfully shot chase scene on the highway. The running gag with explosions is award worthy. The screenwriter really knows all the clichés and when to make fun of them or make a good use of them in the story.Jonha Hill has grown into a wonderful comedian. He never was as funny as he is in this film. Chaning Tatum, whom I have only seen in G.I. Joe surprised me the most from all the actors. He is actually a great comedian. They both play such wonderful idiots. The chemistry between these two actors is so well translated to screen. It almost like from Lethal Weapon. Ice Cube as the police captain of the undercover division steals every scene he is in. He has some of the best lines in the film.

Great movie!,"""21 Jump Street"" was probably one of the best movie adaptations I have ever seen. It was wildly funny, well written, definitely raunchy( but not over the too.) I was going into the movie theaters expecting a very funny time. And that's all I got ! And not your average comedy either; just jokes and a silly plot. No, this movie was amazingly funny, thanks to a brilliant cast, good script, and wonderful imagination, on how to make a 80's television show come to life on the big screen. The last great comedy of this magnitude was none other than ""The Hangover"". Jonah Hill also seems to prove his immaculate talent and promises that him in a good duo, has potential for the years best comedy. Anyone who watches this film, young or old, is guaranteed one of the best times in the theaters this year! Besides the comedy, this movie has good action and definitely no juvenile jokes; this movie is the ideal comedy.

Hilarious and Jam-Packed with Shenanigans,"To say that I am surprised, dear readers, by my full-on, unabashed enthusiasm for 21 Jump Street would be the understatement of the year. When the project was announced, I thought it sounded terrible and the first time I saw the trailer, I thought the same thing. That trailer, though, grew on me with each and every viewing and by the time I got to the theater this weekend, I was primed for a darn good time, and that's exactly what the movie delivers.Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are unlikely pals. In high school, Schmidt was a loser whom Jenko routinely humiliated. But when they both join the police force, they develop a mutually beneficial friendship and eventually become partners on the beat. After a poorly executed drug bust, they are transferred under the command of Captain Dickson (Ice Cube), who runs an undercover unit out of a church on 21 Jump Street. The pair is sent in to a local high school and tasked with infiltrating and bringing down a drug ring that threatens to spread its new product to the surrounding city. But with their roles reversed and the abilities put to the test, can these two misfits get the job done before the entire operation is shut down?One of the things that gave me pause concerning 21 Jump Street is the headliners. I appreciate Hill's talent both as a comedian and an actual actor (as displayed in Moneyball) but his isn't a name that gets me excited. For every Get Him to the Greek (which I love), there's a film like The Sitter (which appeared to be horrendous). I have no such conflict over Tatum's involvement with this project. Aside from his acceptable work in She's the Man (a film I have an odd affection for), I've never seen a movie involving Tatum that I did not leave with a little vomit in my mouth and a little hate in my heart. I've long thought that he might be the worst actor in Hollywood. Surprisingly, not only do Hill and Tatum turn out to be a perfect match for this sort of raucous action-comedy, Tatum is actually the best part. He plays the dumb jock well, a role he is well suited for, but he also displays an excellent comedic timing I wouldn't have thought he had. I'm not saying this will completely change my opinion of the man but it certainly won't hurt. Hill, meanwhile, brings an element of authenticity to his role; he's a nerd at heart who jumps on the chance to finally become cool. It's an antiquated trick that Jump Street pulls but Hill makes it work. Together these two show great chemistry and they work off of each other quite well, giving the feeling of a natural partnership that doesn't always come off with this sort of mismatched pairing.The first act of 21 Jump Street is one of the funniest openers in recent memory. It is an absolute laugh riot, jam-packed with the juvenile-but- well-thought-out humor that is expected from an R-rated comedy in a post-Hangover world. No time is wasted on the set-up as the set of circumstances Schmidt and Jenko find themselves in are established within the first ten minutes and the film's plot is set into motion. I felt the second act, which brings into play the inevitable conflicts between the two buddies, wanes a bit and becomes slightly bogged down, though the fun never stops entirely. Perhaps the worst I could say about this middle portion is that it stretches on a few minutes too long. But before long, the pace again quickens and Schmidt and Jenko get back to the shenanigans that make the first act such a blast.What directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs) have crafted with Jump Street is an homage to the buddy cop movie with a hint of delicious self-awareness that seems appropriate given its '80s roots. They also surround their leads with an outstanding surrounding cast, including the aforementioned Ice Cube (perfect casting), a slightly underused Dave Franco, and the always funny Rob Riggle. Most importantly, the actors are provided with a hilarious script filled with a non-stop stream of jokes that never allows the audience to catch on to the abject stupidity of the characters' actions.Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
One of the best comedies of the 2010's,"One of the best comedies that I have seen in quite sometime, I'm surprised I missed this one for so long. When it comes to anything involving Jonah Hill, you know that you are going to get an extremely hilarious, yet very relatable comedy. I love this one the most, mainly because, I AM those guys. I just graduated from Highschool, and parties and sex and all that stuff is extremely awkward. And they do that SO well. Channing Tatum and Ice Cube surprised me with their comedic chops. Jonah Hill has always been quite a funny guy as well. This movie was so freaking awesome. I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it, and I promise your stomach will hurt by the time the movie ends.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Consistently Funny, But Not Lasting","""21 Jump Street"" (2012) is a movie that starts off strong, with very well timed off-beat humour that gets the viewer interested. It combines this off-beat humour, with self-inflicted sarcasm, which also provides a feeling that the movie isn't taking itself too serious. After the movie cleverly lays out the initial framework, we enter the main plot of Tatum and Hill being sent to high school to infiltrate a drug ring. The plot seems to lull at parts, however has enough well timed, witty humour to prevent the movie from becoming stale. The major problem is that the movie does not achieve to go out with a bang so to speak. There fails to be any memorable parts that leave a lasting impression. The unexpected highlight of the movie was that of Ice Cube's role, in which he provides great comedic relief.Overall the movie is entertaining enough to garner a watch, but is nothing spectacular. 6.50/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
CASEY'S MOVIE MANIA: 21 Jump Street (2012) review,"When I first came to know that (yet) another old TV show is dusted off for a big-screen adaptation, I wasn't that excited at all. After all, that show happens to be the once-popular 21 Jump Street which starred then-young Johnny Depp who became a star here before he gradually earned his distinctive reputation in the Hollywood cinema. Back then, the story about an undercover police unit composed of young-looking officers specializing in youth crime is refreshingly new. But now, it's seriously a worn-out cliché. Then there's the casting of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum -- oh, wait -- Channing Tatum does a comedy? I smell an immediate recipe for disaster here, but directors Chris Miller and Phil Lord's (2009's CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS) live-action debut here seriously caught me by surprise . For all those naysayers out there, this big-screen version of 21 JUMP STREET is surprisingly funny and very entertaining as well.Like the TV show, the movie revolves around Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum), two young-looking cops who both transferred to the 21 Jump Street division where they will be going undercover posing as students to infiltrate the drugs-dealing business that has been going on at a local high school. Both of them go by their names of Doug and Brad, and once there, they must find way to investigate the rampant use of a dangerous hallucinogenic called H.F.S. Their first lead is a dealer and classmate Eric (Dave Franco), whom they are trying to get close with, in hope that one day he will lead them to the mysterious supplier.Story-wise, Michael Bacall and Jonah Hill's screenplay is actually nothing new at all. But what makes it refreshingly different than most like-minded script out there is the way how the execution is played out in such a hilarious manner. While there are times the script is trying too hard to be funny, rest assured most of the scenes never fail to elicit some genuine laughs. Thanks to the hard R-rating, Bacall and Jonah Hill let the story rip with all those colorful profanities like nobody's business. Added to that, is some of the worthwhile self-parody gags throughout the movie, especially the highway car chase scene involving the theory of exploding vehicles.Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller knows well how to keep the pace as entertaining as possible, while the cast here are no doubt the main star attraction here. Jonah Hill proves once again he's one of the genuine comic talents working today, but it was Channing Tatum who totally hits the ballpark with his surprisingly hilarious performance. Personally, I always thought Tatum's acting skill is always wooden at any given genre he's been involving so far (action, drama, romance) but he's finally proved himself as an excellent performer. In fact, both he and Jonah Hill are terrific together. And that's not all -- the rest of the supporting cast are equally playful and memorable as well, including Brie Larson as love interest Molly and Ice Cube at his profane best as Captain Dickson.Apart from a flair of comedy, Phil Lord and Chris Miller does show some genuine talents in term of delivering well-crafted action sequence. Case in point is the aforementioned highway car chase scene and the violent shootout finale. Overall, 21 JUMP STREET is one of the best action comedy movies really need to be checked out for. And while you're at it, there's a surprise cameo appearance (priceless, indeed) throughout the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
There are more than 21 reasons why you should check this one out!,"Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump! I sound a bit Kris Krossed there or Van Halenish, take your pick. I just wanted to jump in quickly to my review of the hilarious comedy ""21 Jump Street"". The film is based on the popular 80's TV show. Like the show, the film focuses on a couple of young police officers who go undercover in a high school to investigate crimes, more of the drug dealing affair. Channing Tatum stars as young Officer Jenko, who is the muscular good-looking type but not too bright in the cerebral bulb. Jenko (the J is not silent) was a bully during high school. Jonah Hill co-stars as young Officer Schmidt, who is the vertically challenged officer who is gifted with mental aptitude but lacking in the physical component. Schmidt was one of Jenko's main bully targets in high school. So jump few years later, and what we see is that Jenko & Schmidt reunite now as young officers and even partner up together; but this time around in a more friendly tone, even though they do have their disagreements. Schmidt and Jenko's undercover high school mission is to find the supplier of a dangerous synthetic drug that is being circulated and sold in the school to many students. But due to their inadequacies, Schmidt and Jenko do get in a bit of uproarious situations in trying to complete their mission, which in hence becomes nearly a ""Mission Impossible""; had to plug in another movie that was adapted from a popular TV show. Speaking of missions, Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller have successfully completed the mission that many filmmakers have not been able to succeed in, which is adapting an infamous TV show into a great film. Michael Bacall's screenplay was side-splitting and engaging. Channing Tatum demonstrated that he could bare his stuff also for the comedic genre with his humorous performance as Jenko. And it is ""No Schmidt"" that Jonah Hill is quite the talent, with yet another strong performance here as Schmidt. Other ""21 Jump Street"" notable acting performances that were on target included Ice Cube as the fiery Police Captain Dickson, Rob Riggle as the oddball P.E. Coach Mr. Walters , and some guy that had the ""21 Jump Street"" gig before who should remain nameless so I do not commit the horrific cinematic crime of movie spoiling. ""21 Jump Street"" is a very funny movie that you should investigate as soon as possible. ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Awesome Freaking Movie!,"This movie is one of the funniest I have seen in a long time. Jonah Hill is an amazing and funny actor, along side the incredible and charming Channing Tatum.

If you are planning on seeing it, do it. And if you're not, then go see it. It is worth it and will become one of you're favorite movies, like it now is one of mine.

A Classic Buddy Cop Comedy of the 10s,"Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill gave us a great tribute to the 80s buddy cop show, with two low ranking officers turned Narcs at their old highschool that they went to in the early 2000s. With a nice ending, formula, jokes and acting, 21 Jump Street brought something new; to a then dying genre (and still dying as of 2021). I have to give some credit to Ice Cube, Zac Effron and Brie Larson for adding on to the comedic elements in shockingly good performances from those mediocre actors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Better than expected but way too long,"By the end of this movie I was ready to hop out of my seat and leave the theater. The last 20 minutes or so were definitely minutes wasted. I didn't like Ice Cube's role in this movie, although I'm sure the average person would've found his lines hilarious. In terms of the plot, it was fun and creative. I absolutely love Jonah Hill. He makes me laugh and surprisingly he didn't loose his laugh-ability since he lost weight. I loved him big though, just a cutie pie and hilarious. As for the movie, he's helps make the movie better than it would've been if he weren't starring in it. I'm not just saying that because I have a slight crush on Jonah either.

This film feels manyfactured and stupid, completely out of it and not in a good way: it's like someone just wrote down a list of what they think will be perceived as obscene or improper and then shoved it into the script without a second thought. There are some good jokes and themes, but together it just doesn't work, doesn't sync.

Surprisingly Fun for the Dumb Teenager Inside Me,"My gf loved this movie as a teenager, and I was pretty hesitant of this movie because some of the movie humor she used to like has not aged well. I was planning to sit on my phone and have a couple of laughs when Jonah Hill said something goofy, but after 5 minutes I started giving it my full attention because of the surprisingly good humor. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill own this movie because of their acting combined with the hilarious writing. It isn't perfect because the plot and side characters could have been a bit more complex/fleshed out, but this movie isn't aiming to be some insightful film about drug use- it is a buddy cop movie that delivers plenty of laughs if dumb guy humor is your thing, and I was very pleasantly surprised.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Extremely Clever and Hilarious,"I'm starting to really love 2012. After watching many great films (including this), I am actually starting to believe that 2012 is a really great year for movies. 21 Jump Street was a very awesome movie with very creative and humorous script. This movie is about 2 guys (cops) and they are accepted in to a ""club"" called 21 jump street. They are assigned to investigate who the drug dealer is and who the supplier is and arrest them. One of the things i really liked about this movie is the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. They were both great and really funny in this movie. Surprisingly, I'm going to say Channing was a little funnier than Jonah. But this movie was really really good. It is a really great time in the theaters watching with your friends.

Quite funny,"Totally pretty good. No, it's never going to win Best Picture, but it's an amusing comedy. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are both great as dumb rookie cops who are sent back to high school undercover as students. Tatum screws up and exchanges his popular kid role for Hill's nerd, and both find out how the other half lives. Dave Franco (James' younger brother) is good as the environmentally-conscious villain, and Brie Larson (Scott Pilgrim vs. the World) is good as Hill's love interest. Rob Riggle and The Office's Ellie Kemper have nice roles as teachers (Chris Parnell, on the other hand, feels wasted) and Ice Cube and Nick Offerman (Parks & Recreation) are great as the officers' superiors. Sure, it's pretty sloppy, but it's funny and clever where it counts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"Good old high school comedy,with Cops!","21 Jump Street is a comedy with a lot of crude jokes, physical humour and a cast that can seem awkward as hell at times, yet still it is a hilarious film indeed. With a surprising performance from one the cast members and a story that doesn't have to be all about the comedy, 21 Jump Street succeeds in bringing humour we usually see only aimed at younger people, to everyone. I did feel that the film was solidly good and here below I will tell you why I thought that.The story is actually well paced, doesn't rush along but never tries to compact all it's jokes in at once, this means jokes are evenly spread and right up until the end you still laugh. It is yes, full of so called ""rudeness"", this one is a miss for the whole family, but a watch nevertheless for the older people in the house as it may touch your comedy nerve and have you in fits of laughter. One more thing that this film gains is the way it has action scenes and car chases but doesn't always need humour to make them fun, the emotional side of the movie is terrible but the action/comedy and crime is excellent.Channing Tatum surprised me here, he is the one who succeeds in doing well both in serious parts and comedy parts, I felt Jonah Hill although consistently funny, failed in a dramatic sense and parts become awkward when he enters. The rest of the cast work around them well, Ice Cube would have more appreciated if he had been in much more scenes. I liked Dave Franco, he is chilled all the way through and then the coach played by Rob Riggle is hilarious, brings much more different humour types in.I liked the script and the group of people who wrote it do well to not only have physical humour or one liners, but also avoid recycling old jokes we have seen so often from high school comedies. At times the direction is poor, the script as said is great but when the characters come out to do it, sometimes direction is poor, makes scenes awkward and the joke ends after 3 seconds. One thing are the stunts, good gun battles and also car chases, make parts thrilling whilst you also laughing, all good stuff.I guess one criticism is the crudeness, yes there parts maybe over doing the talk about the genital area, or about certain acts. The film is never dragged down because of crudeness but better jokes could have been placed in. As said the direction, it just makes scenes awkward, not funny and ruins the potential jokes the script has laid out for them and also Tatum and Hill have so much precision with the jokes, it is a waste at times.I could easily say ""if your between 15 and 35, go and see this"" ,but I won't. I do believe than a vast mixed bag of people can and will like this and seeing as it is a remake of the original, fans of the old one may want to have a little look at this newer version. Some will have a big dislike for this movie and many will feel we have had this before, seen it before and the actors are just doing roles(especially Hill) that they have done before. I will say though that high schooler's may take a more special liking to it, seeing as it is about high school and all the modern things high schooler's do.Overall yes it is Solidly a Good movie, not quite Very Good but way more than just a pretty good try at comedy. Have fun with it, don't take it to seriously and really, pretend your still in high school, you'll have more fun. Watch out for an interesting plot too, it is surprisingly well thought out for a straight out comedy and they don't mind loosening the jokes to let a bit of the seriousness out, but only for a few seconds because someone will host a house party.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Pleasantly Surprised, one of my new fav comedies.

But let me tell you, this movie is more than just a remake. It's a hilarious, well-written, and well-acted comedy that had me laughing out loud.What I appreciated most about this movie was how it tackled sensitive issues like cultural appropriation and stereotypes in a way that was both funny and thought-provoking.

A surprisingly good comedy,"This one worked for me as good as ""The other guys"". I assume the two people who read this review are familiar with the plot, so I'll just lay down the goodies. Script = smart. There's a plot onto which the jokes are glued on, and not vice versa. It works both on the meta - level (parody) as also a conventional comedy. The emotional spots and parts where it digs into the ""nerds vs. hunks"" - setting is good, and it truly rises above the material when it analyzes friendships. Acting = spot on. Jonah Hill delivers his usual goods and wisely gives more light to - applause - Tatum Channing. This guy has charisma and has managed to carve out his niche in both drama and action roles. Now he delivers an absolutely hilarious comedic performance out of the bushes. L-effin-OL. Deadpan, check. Timing, check. Also, he isn't trying to steal scenes (Will Smith- style) and is game even when his character is the butt of the jokes. Watching him is like watching an R-rated version of Joey from ""Friends"".It's a bit shy on the action, but it pays off with comedy. The chemistry between Hill & Channing is exceptional so I'm really looking forward to see a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Comedies are just as capable of narrative brilliance as any other film,"This is without a doubt one of the funniest, cleverest and yet somehow sweetest comedies I have ever seen. Hill and Tatum both play against type as a minor plot curve ball immediately sets up the new premise of the film. Hill finds out that he is now considered cool, whilst Tatum falls in with the dorks and learns something. Its so easy for cheap comedies to skim the development and journeys of its characters, but 21 Jump Street is an amazing success.Much of the credit goes to the brilliant writing of Michael Bacall, who packs a screenplay full of heart, wit and sheer hilarity. Hill and Tatum not only kill their delivery, but are brilliant physical comedians and have impeccable chemistry. Its not only believable but plausible that the two characters could be brothers. Literally every single joke in this film works to perfection and actually establishes character while entertaining. Schmidt is an idiot with weapons and social interactions, whilst Jenko is a buffoon with anything requiring smarts. The way the two play off each other and grow as men is utterly delightful.Dave Franco is every inch the cool kid but also aces the freakout scenes later on. Brie Larson is adorable as Schmidt's love interest Molly. Ice Cube is a hilarious ""angry black captain"" stealing every single scene he's in. And there's one of the best cameos ever put to film towards the end. Phil Lord and Chris Miller direct the film with flair and you can tell they had an absolute ball making it with the flashy highlights and jolted cuts that make everything funny.21 Jump Street only serves to highlight how badly 22 Jump Street missed its own point. The humour comes from the role reversal of Schmidt getting in too deep and so craving popularity he forgets what he is. Comedies can be brilliant film stories too, and 21 Jump Street knocks it out of the park.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

The recurring non-explosions was﻿ genius.But the best thing in the film, other than the plot, is the chemistry shared between Hill and Tatum. It was clear that since Hill co-wrote the story, there was more focus on his character of Schmidt and his journey to come out of the shell and build some self-esteem, versus Jenko having to learn what it's like being the bullied rather than the bully, and becoming exposed as being a dumb jock at every turn, if not for his sense of loyalty to build upon.

Brilliantly Funny Comedy,"21 Jump Street is apparently something of a remake of the 1987 TV series starring Johnny Depp and Dustin Nguyen (it's a couple of years before my time so I haven't seen it yet to compare the two) which features underachieving policemen Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) who are assigned the task of posing as high school students in an undercover operation to bring down a drugs ring, leading the pair into a whole host of hilarious situations.Despite the juvenile nature that you'd typically expect from this film (not normally something I particularly enjoy) I thought this film was hilarious. Some of the jokes were very base but these were fairly outnumbered by some genuine good humour. Of course the whole film borders on the silly and far-fetched throughout but it never pretends to be anything other than just that, and rarely feels like it's trying too hard for audience laughs. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are a dream comedy duo in this: their differences in acting styles and personalities are played up in stereotypes which make for some real fun, especially as the stereotypical American high school is a strong factor. Dave Franco plays the shifty popular kid and offers an enjoyable performance that occasionally stands up to the humour of Tatum and Hill, although the biggest laughs from a more minor character come from Ice Cube, the exasperated chief at the 21 Jump Street Facility. There's a nice cameo appearance from the original 21 Jump Street-ers Johhny Depp and Dustin Nguyen too.If you're looking for a brilliantly funny comedy that's full of light- hearted silliness then it doesn't get much funnier than this. Despite being a little apprehensive I absolutely cracked up at this film and can't wait to see if the sequel lives up to the laugh out loud humour in this.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

21 Jump Street exceeded my expectations,"I recently saw the movie ""21 Jump Street"" in theaters. I knew it would be funny, considering the presence of Jonah Hill as a lead role. I was initially thrown off by the overuse of mocking references to homosexuality, but the movie improved as it went on. These references never ceased, but I became accustomed to them as the story progressed, and so I was able to have an overall enjoyable experience. The movie displayed great humor and originality. It seems to be growing increasingly common for contemporary movies to have overly-predictable plot lines and unoriginal ideas. While it may not be possible for anyone to come up with a one hundred percent original plot, it is possible to have profound occurrences within the movie, which is one feat this movie accomplished. Too often in comedic movies featuring policemen, the end result is predictable and pleasing for all sides of the problem in some way. It was nice to see a fairly realistic ending, even if there were unrealistic points in the movie. The choice to place Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum in their respective roles was impeccable. Each presented a distinct contribution to the movie. For Jonah, it was his somewhat nerdy, quirky energy. As for Channing, his quiet aggression, coupled with his humor really caused me to side with him at points of the movie. ""21 Jump Street"" impressed me. The most appealing aspects of this movie were its original comedic plot and its realistic approach to a zany movie topic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

one of the pleasant surprises of 2012 for a few reasons,"A property like 21 Jump Street was something I didn't have many expectations for: I didn't watch the show (despite young Johnny Depp as the star), and the prospect of another buddy-cop comedy is not something that is an instant hit. You need fresh ideas and a good sense of humor about what you're working with. And yet there were a number of people who came in and made it a real surprise. Watching just the trailer you get a sense of the comic timing and approach of total who gives a s*** irreverence from Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum (and Ice Cube as well as the guy heading up their plot), and that this is fully self-aware. Part of this comes from the actors, but it also comes from the directors Lord and Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs was where they showed everyone they could do it, while The LEGO movie two years later cemented their reputations as the new great comedy directing team).A lot of the jokes and lines and throw-away moments that just carry a lot of solid laughs come from the filmmakers trusting their actors to pull off some dumb jokes in smart ways, and visa-versa. I include Channing Tatum in this, and he surprised me the most in that before this movie I didn't think he was much of an actor (mostly from his dramas, where he just seemed weak or trying too hard). But in one year, between this movie and Magic Mike, he showed that he has real charm and screen presence, and knows how to find the way to play things both straight and funny when a dialog exchange is required. Of course here he's the more tough presence set against Jonah Hill, and yet there's plenty of jokes put at his expense that he plays like a... pro!There's some set pieces that revel in the action, and it comes close to running out of steam in the last third (until it reveals a couple of big cameos that shouldn't be big surprises, but they're still actors that suddenly give a shot of adrenaline to the comedy and action in the climax). For long stretches though 21 Jump Street leaps so high above what this could have been as a generic remake of a popular TV show; it's like actual clever ideas and gags on display, and a lot of it comes down to behavior as well, whether it's the main two actors or with Ice Cube, or Brie Larson as one of the supporting women set at the high school, (or Dave Franco of course), and there's plenty of times where it comes down to the actors saying one thing or another and finding just the right moment to make something funny.Not every single joke clicks, but so many do that 21 Jump Street makes the cop (undercover) comedy conceit fresh and fun. You see these guys just having pure fun with finding how to dig into what makes these clichés tic, and not simply with buddy/cop movies but just how buddies relate in a movie. It's got heart underneath when it takes a breath between things like stabbing Hill in the back at a party (no, don't worry, it's in the trailer, and it's as awesome as it seems).",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Another great 2012 comedy,"21 Jump Street is really nice action comedy with a lot of influences by its producers, who also were starring in the film. This was Channing Tatum's first attempt in comedy and, like i've said before, it's really interesting to watch how the actor can adapt to any role. Jonah Hill on the other hand is one of the new great comedians of this new film wave. Sarcastic, smart, rebellious. They made both of the characters to learn something from each other. Successful chemistry.Besides the catchy title that might take you back in the time of the TV series, this film shares only the mission of a couple of young looking police officers that are assigned to an undercover drug research in a high school, as students. Watch carefully though.. You'll find out what i mean.It's a fun film with good music, fresh scenes and a rather young and talented cast. You have the right to remain silent and watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Totally abusive of the original series.,"I was SO looking forward to this 'modern' version of 21 Jump Street! How bitterly disappointed was I? I feel sorry for the people who have never seen the original Jump Street series with Johnny Depp. This movie isn't ANYTHING like the original and I think it's a disgrace they even got the rights to do this. In the original, the Jump Street detectives are just there because of their youthful looks, not because they were incompetent morons! The overall theme was of drama, although there was the obvious comic moments shared between the cast. The original also raised important social/political issues of the time (AIDS, homosexuality, child abuse, bullying ,gang violence, abortion, sexual violence) and tried to deal sensitively with the stigma of these issues and 'educate' the masses, whose ignorant, racist, sexist (and whatever 'ist' is left) attitudes held our society back. In a way the show tried to 'right' some of the 'wrongs' our self-centered society had created, it didn't glorify it. I love comedy as much as anyone, but this rubbish just mocked the original show and only serves to justify the current B-S lives people wallow in! And I'm sure this hasn't addressed any of the racist/sexist issues we STILL experienced. Boy, haven't we evolved???",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Falling far from the proverbial tree.,"""21 Jump Street,"" was a popular show in late 80s and early 90s. Although the characters on the show were young looking enough to pass for high school students, the tone of the show was serious; often dealing with real-life issues. Fast forward to 2012, and you get a parody of a, one- time, praised show. Much like Seth Rogans twist on ""green Hornet,"" 2012's ""21 Jump Street"" opted to make a mockery of the original work Intentional or not, the parodying of cult classic is becoming more and more unsettling.As a stand alone film, this movie was not terrible. It has good use of slapstick and scatological humor, and despite having the emotional acting range of a dried up cactus, Channing Tatum's character is comedic. Perhaps this film should have gone by a different title. ""Underclassmen 2,"" as it more closely resembled the lack-luster comedy ""Underclassmen,"" starring Nick Cannon. With so many title featuring young, child, or teenage cops, you expect at least a refreshing title to go along with the already unoriginal film.Overall, it was not terrible, but don't expect anything that really ties it back to the show.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Laughing scenes throughout the film make the 109 minute movie easily bearable. Some good cameo roles keeps the viewer on their feet and shows off just how versatile some actors are.Good plot and easy to tell story, far funnier than I thought it would be and great acting duo between Hill and Tatum.

Flop,"This movie was absolutely woeful. I watched it because everyone has be raving about how good it is. To be honest I really shouldn't of expected much given the fact that the general public is impressed by such simple tripe these days.I got two or three laughs out of the entire movie, and these where for that crazy gym teacher who only had a smaller minor role. I didn't think either main character were that good or funny. Didn't like the start of the movie, just seemed to rush right into the main plot with little thought given to the beginning.Lots and lots of gay oral references in this movie. Also lots of stereotypes. I found it a bit weird that the only time you see Tatum being ""aggressive"" is when he is talking to and then later subjugating in a vulgar sexual manner an African American male while in police uniform. He is also seen later to punch in the face another African American male who turns out to be gay.Overall a crap waste of time thats filled with racial and sexual content.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Hysterical ""21 Jump Street""","Evading gnarly biker drug dealers, undercover cops Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill hide in a Drivers Ed car. Tatum as Jenko tells Hill as Schmidt to pretend like he is giving him oral sex. Hill asks, 'Why me?' Tatum screams, ""You're the one in the f***ing Peter Pan costume!"" ""21 Jump Street"" is hysterical! It has got to be the funniest movie of the year.Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are awesome together and elevate Bromance to another level. They have a distinct goofy and sweet bond. Jonah Hill also wrote the story with screenwriter Michael Bacall based on the beloved 90's TV series which distinguished Johnny Depp. Depp also has an outrageous cameo as Hanson. Along with Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller (""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs"") this ""Jump Street"" is juggernaut parody with an amazingly authentic high school culture vibe. ""21 Jump Street"" is hilarious and arrestingly cool.Hill and Bacall brilliantly take humorous shots at everyone blurring all lines. On the first day of school undercover, Jenko (Tatum) punches an African American teen; who he thinks gets in his face, turns out the kid is gay. Jenko says he didn't know he was gay. The kids verbally attack him for punching a gay kid. Deadpan Schmidt (Hill) says, ""So in a weird way, he is homophobic if he didn't hit him?"" The logic escapes me, but the moment is classic. After getting their undercover assignment at abandoned street church, Schmidt prays, ""Hey Korean Jesus"" There is actually a Korean Jesus on the cross. Jenko cracks up at Schmidt from behind.Tatum and Hill are deadpan genius. With Jonah Hill you kind of expect this. Channing Tatum is brilliantly funny. Tatum is undercover with a bunch of science geeks, one kid asks, ""So you were held back (2 years)?"" He replies, ""So you were held forward (2 years)?"" Will Ferrell would be proud. Obviously, ""21 Jump Street"" leverages the polarized personas. Tatum is the ripped handsome action guy playing the stupid jock. Hill, who slimmed down, is the vulnerable nerd, who wants to be cool. Both play in position. After being mortal enemies in high school they reunite 7 years later at the Police Academy. Jenko says, ""Hey not so Slim Shady, what's up?"" Schmidt aces all the written exams. The physical training is cake for Jenko. They wisely form a partnership. Here Lord and Miller believably transform cultural opposites into best buds—the underlying sweetness of ""21 Jump Street"". The humor always pushes the envelope, but they are never ever mean spirited. And there are a lot of penis jokes— most of them hilarious.Jenko and Schmidt graduate. However, their ""lifetime of being bad asses"" takes an unfortunate turn. They are assigned as bike cops on park patrol. After a botched arrest and hilarious Miranda rights screw up, the duo are assigned to 21 Jump Street. Director of the program Captain Dickson, played with funny angry gusto by Ice Cube, informs everyone, ""You are here because you are Justin Beiber, Miley Cyrus looking mother f***ers!"" Dickson wants Schmidt and Jenko to go undercover at their old high school and find the supplier of a particularly deadly designer drug. They watch YouTube videos of the stages of intoxication. While undercover they live with Schmidt's proud parents (funny Cardine Aaron and Joe Chrest). Pointing out an embarrassing kid glamor photo, Jenko says, ""You look like a young Jay Leno.""High school has changed from 2005. The cool kids are the preppy environmentally conscious teens lead by Eric (slick charming Eric Franco). Not memorizing their student identities Schmidt ends up on the track team and drama class, while Jenko goes to class with science nerds in AP Chemistry. So while Jenko learns about covalent bonds, Schmidt meets popular Molly (ironic and perky Brie Larson). Schmidt may have a shot at redemption for his high school romantic crash and burn. Rob Riggles is ridiculously funny as gym teacher Mr. Walters. He has a gut busting scene with the boys when they are as high as a kite.Surprisingly, ""21 Jump Street"" poignantly gets redemption and lifetime friendship. Jenko learns that he can be smart, and schools his geek brothers in being cool. There is an awesome montage with doves. The not so inside joke works: Tatum and Hill don't look at all like high school kids. After Jenko beats the crap out of bullies at their house party with his slick mixed martial arts skills, he stares in shock at Schmidt. Schmidt says, ""When did I get stabbed? That's awesome!"" Tatum and Hill have an endearing chemistry: they are funny together and you get that they really pull for each other. They redefine comedic Bromance in ""21 Jump Street"".

21 Jump Street (2012) - How Many TV Shows are Being Brought to Film?,"Throughout the years, Hollywood has always adapted classic television shows from the 80s, and landed them on film. Now, someone has decided to adapt Johnny Depp's television crime drama ""21 Jump Street"", and turn it into a hilarious comedy. That's not a good decision, but for some reason, it actually worked. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum both deliver a hilarious ""bro-mance"" chemistry as two former high school enemies, who become friends after being reunited at a police academy. After not remembering the Miranda rights, when trying to arrest their first criminal, they are transferred to a revised police program from the 80s on 21 Jump Street, where their mission is to go undercover as high school students, to take down a drug ring happening at the exact same school that these two guys used to go to, and now all hell breaks loose. Someone must need to hunt this movie down because ""21 Jump Street"" is the funniest movie of the year so far. A well-written script, a hilarious cast, and a fresh storyline can help make a perfect comedy. This is a crisp, original, and hilarious ""fun ride"" of a movie! Jonah Hill proves that he is a fresh comedian, and it will help him lead into more funnier projects soon. Channing Tatum may not be a good actor in a action or drama flicks, but he is better as a focused and funny comedian. Watching these two guys as buddies is quite perfect, and everyone immediately buys the fact that they become friends. We also get some hilarious performances from Rob Riggle as a creepy high school coach, Ellie Kemper as a chemistry teacher whose sexually attracted to Channing Tatum, and Ice Cube in a hilarious performance as the boss of 21 Jump Street. Brie Larson plays a teen school girl that Jonah Hill suddenly falls in love with. Even though it sounds a little wrong, the audience immediately buys their chemistry, and you want them to be together. The only disappointing character came from James Franco's brother, Dave Franco, who delivers a weak villain, and he was sort of miscast. Not to mention that this guy is also ridiculously annoying. The rest of ""21 Jump Street"" is downright perfect in every sense possible. Throughout the entire movie, I laughed my ass off, like I've never laughed before. This movie kept going and going with great jokes, and it's still hilarious. They make you want to jump in your seat, and they make you leave the theater pumped up with so much energy. Also, Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise, the stars of the original television show, make a cameo appearance, and it's just plain funny. Why wouldn't that be funny? Also, I also liked the heart of this movie, and how it affects you in some way. When you mix together comedy, action, and a good heart, there's your comedy! But what really impressed me the most is that this film makes fun of the usual ""cop movie"" clichés, flips them around, and brings something new out of them. It is completely self-aware of itself, which makes the comedy aspect so much better. So, I enjoyed the hell out of this movie, and I would buy this movie on DVD or Blu-Ray.

"Trying to be The Hangover, but not quite there","First of all, I enjoyed this movie a lot. I laughed a lot, although I thought the funniest clip of the movie was Nick Offerman's character describing the 21 Jump Street Program, which happens near the beginning.You could tell that the type of jokes and the scenarios they were put in were trying to mimic the successes of movies like The Hangover and Superbad. That's not a bad thing since those movies were wildly successful and funny, but they tend to get a little old after a while.What this movie lacked was the content that The Hangover or Superbad had, and that's partly due to the fact that it's a remake, so the story isn't new. It also parallels a lot of partner cop movies. Partners don't get along, then partners get along and everything is great for a while, then something goes wrong, then they come out on top.Obviously, we expect to see Jonah Hill in a comedy, but not necessarily Channing Tatum. I thought they made a pretty good duo, despite the fact that the roles that they played were pretty typical of what you would expect from each.Again, I enjoyed the movie and would highly recommend it, but would not put it in the same echelon of comedy movies like The Hangover and Superbad.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Brilliant Comedy,"I saw an advanced screening of 21 Jump Street this week, and it didn't disappoint. So many clever jokes in such a brisk runtime: you really won't want it to end. The best thing about this movie is that it doesn't insult the audience at all, and is completely showered with brilliant gags and phenomenal writing. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are a completely impeccable duo, and they really need to do more films together. Tatum's true calling is definitely comedy, and Jonah Hill shows off a different side from what we've seen. Dave Franco has been turning in scene- stealing supporting roles for years now, so it's nice to see him have a pretty meaty role in such a comedy. There is also a really bizarre but strangely effective cameo that had the entire audience clapping; the final act is a series of increasingly more hilarious situations that bring all the ideas to their highest peak. I really hope this movie receives the critical acclaim and audience attention it so rightly deserves, because it really is the best comedy of the year so far and it will be pretty much impossible to top it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Surprisingly funny,"Funny movie overall. Realism is thrown out the door early on, and honestly it's a comedy, so who expects much realism. There are some awesome in-jokes for fans of the show, but mostly this is for a different audience (though a lot of jokes are surprisingly connected to the original show, regardless of how different the tones are between the two). My favorite part of this movie is the meta, self-referential jokes throughout, such as not saying the title of the movie at the most cliché moment to do so, and references to unoriginality in ideas, and non-exploding/exploding items, etc. Channing Tatum is also surprisingly good in this movie, plays his character well and humorously alongside Jonah Hill (who I love, though I understand why many may dislike him).

Disappointing,"Usually the IMDb ratings are a fair assessment of the quality of a movie, at least when a seizable amount of viewers have taken part. Of course there is a lot of pressure from the movies producers to bias the results. When films have a small samples this is sometimes the case. You get the impression here that somehow, someone has managed to do this here in spite of the largish amount of people that have somehow taken part. The movie itself is trash, unoriginal and in spite of the cameo appearances decisively unfunny. It is unlikely that anyone that has a modicum of common sense can see this production and think that is anything but a larger budget run of the mill B movie.

Great Comedy,"This is the third Lord & Miller film I saw. Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is one of my childhood memories, and Lego Movie was one of my favorites when I was 12-13 y/o.Even though I haven't rewatched those movies in years, I still have fond memories of them.I only saw Animated/ Family movies from this duo, and I was curious to see what their R-Rated comedy was like.And I had a Lot of fun with 21 Jump Street. Not only the film has great script, good direction, but I think the biggest strength of 21 is the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. I already was impressed with Hill in movies like The Wolf of Wall Street, but I didn't expect Channing Tatum to be this good. The movie would not have been the same without them.The first half of the movie showing the two guys getting into high school and starting their investigation was the funniest part of the movie personally. I laughed so hard so many moments. I don't know if they will still be as funny when I rewatch them, but I'm telling you - this is the most time I laughed watching a movie in my recent memory.I recently watched another comedy Hangover, and I think 21 is funnier.I laughed less time during the second half, and that is not necessarily a bad thing I think. You need some time to develop some characters and slow down a bit, especially with comedy genre. If you show the audience gags non-stop, it might get tiring and loose steam a bit.And I think the second half lost steam just a little bit. I was watching the movie and I wasn't bored, but I was not, like blown away or heavily impressed. I thought the second half was fine.The movie has a lot of instances where something mentioned in the first act comes back later. And they are satisfying to watch! That is good writing.Even though the second half could have been slightly better, the movie is still very entertaining and very well made. The actors all did a great job, even the actors with smaller roles like Ice Cube and Dakota Johnson.I can't wait to watch the sequel.* The movie makes me wonder what Lord& Miller's Solo could've been.

A decent remake of an 80s show,As you would be aware by now 21 Jump Street is a remake of the television show from the 80s with the same name. This is a nice remake and it could be said that the film serves more of a nostalgic homage to the 80s than it does trying to be a standalone feature film.

Occasionally amusing but is always trying too hard,"Being in the UK, I was only aware of the show 21 Jump Street retrospectively because of Johnny Depp becoming famous; other than that I had never seen it but figured that this would be fine to watch the film remake. The plot is as the show, two young police officers are selected to go undercover in the school system as students in order to crack open the drugs trade by befriending the dealers and then uncovering the supplier above them. As one would expect, hilarity ensues. Well, sort of.Billed as a comedy 21 Jump Street could never be accused of being high-brow or setting its sights too high. The tone of the film is not as low as gross-out comedy, but generally the tone is juvenile and consistently crude. This shows itself in the constant swearing, the noise that it brings with itself and the sense of it being a lot less funny than it thinks it is. It is a shame because it had potential; it has a nice tone of self-mockery but it is never done smartly enough to really take (it is spelt out in mile-high letters, ruining the impact it could have had). Along with some of this, there are specific jokes and moments that I laughed at (bits of Ice Cube's excessive delivery, the lack of explosions during a car chase etc) but mostly the humour is broad and wide and simple in the extreme. Part of the problem for me was that it wasn't sharp enough – it felt baggy and relaxed in a way that sort of suits the characters and the tone of the film, but doesn't suit the material. As a result the jokes feel softer than they should be and they are always worked harder than they can stand.By this I mean the time spent on each. Some are hit and move on and they work well for it, but too often we have the joke settling in and having too much time on it, so that the film and the actors feel like they are trying too hard with lesser material, which I guess is partially true at least. Hill and Tatum benefit from playing against type (to a point) but neither is great here – just noisy and boisterous. Larson has nothing to really do while Franco's main impact is to continually bug you about where you've seen him before (until you realise you're thinking of his brother). Riggle is a funny guy – I know this because I'm a Daily Show fan, but here he is just noisy (a little funny – but not too much). Ice Cube is OK but his one-joke performance really only made me laugh once or twice.21 Jump Street isn't an awful film by any means – it is just a very broad and unpolished one. The jokes lacks sharpness and the film feels like it is overdoing most things and trying too hard for too little return. There are moments and jokes that made me laugh but they were too few and far between, leaving distracting and slightly amusing noise to fill the rest of the film. So-so at best and it really needs you to be in a lazy, Friday-night mindset before you even bother approaching it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Unexpectedly Funny Remake, Not Bad At All","After the uneven, not-so-good results of other remakes of 80s TV series like ""Charlie's Angels,"" ""Miami Vice,"" or ""The A-Team,"" I was not really expecting to like this remake of ""21 Jump Street."" This is especially since it was going to be a comedy, which usually mocks the original, instead of pay tribute to it. However, with critics fawning all over it with rave reviews, I was compelled to give it a chance.Like the original TV series that inspired it, a couple of young-looking cops -- fat nerd Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and dimwit jock Jenko (Channing Tatum) -- are given the assignment to go undercover in a high school to investigate the proliferation of designer drugs. The film follows their misadventures as the case also challenges them individually and tests their friendship. After raunchy comedies had their heyday last year (with ""Hangover 2,"" ""Bridesmaids,"" ""Horrible Bosses""), the gross-out gags here were tame in comparison. I did not enjoy seeing high school kids being bullies or drug addicts or foul-mouths. However, the chemistry between the two leads, and the heart of the storyline about their friendship did make a difference. The surprise climactic cameo guest appearances were very welcome indeed, though I was disappointed about how that ended.I have not seen ""Superbad"" which launched Jonah Hill into comic superstardom. I only knew him from his more serious Oscar-nominated turn in ""Moneyball."" He is quite funny as Schmidt. He was not afraid to make fun of himself. Anyone who would not be embarrassed about running around in a dorky green Peter Pan costume while chasing criminals should be given top props. Channing Tatum is more known as a romantic lead (""Step Up"") or action hero (""GI Joe""), so he was the unknown quantity in this movie. While his straight man act is quite unexpectedly okay, he still looked a bit uncomfortable in a lot of scenes.Overall, this film was OK. It was a hilarious and fun ride in general, and it had a heart amidst all that. Warning though that you would have to go through rough patches of obscenities and drug scenes involving high school kids which may not really sit well with all audiences.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Dialogues, action, and timing, everything is just awesome. I haven't seen the original but this one is definitely worth your time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Surprisingly effective for a reboot of a TV show,"Generally speaking, you'd be right to be skeptical about the quality of a reboot of a largely forgotten TV show from the 1980's. Personally, I've never even seen the original show, let alone remember it fondly. Then again, perhaps it's this unfamiliarity that makes the movie seem somewhat unique. Also, treating the premise with a much more a comedic touch helps to counteract its inherent implausibility.For those unaware of the movie's premise, it's that a pair of young cops (Channing Tatum & Jonah Hill) are given an undercover assignment at a local high school with the goal of taking down a drug ring. It's a simple set-up but, as I said before, one that's fairly unique. Played straight, this probably wouldn't work but when treated as an action comedy there's loads of potential. What particularly makes the movie work is its self-referential style that plays with movie conventions. That being said, even while sending up cop movie cliches, the movie still functions as an entertaining crime movie.Much of the credit goes to the two seemingly mismatched leads - Channing Tatum & Jonah Hill. Tatum is, of course, the more stereotypical choice to play a cop but he actually shows an unexpected flair for comedy as well. Jonah Hill's comedic chops are well known but, most importantly, he & Tatum have excellent chemistry together. This doesn't just apply to the comedic side of the movie, either. The relationship between the two characters is a driving force throughout the entire movie. Apart from the leads, there's some notable talent in supporting roles as well. Future Oscar winner Brie Larson plays a prominent role, as does Dave Franco. Ice Cube, Nick Offerman & Rob Riggle are among the supporting players that strengthen the movie's comedic punch. Lastly, there's a unexpected cameo appearance that's too good to spoil.Directors Phil Lord & Christopher Miller did a nice job in their live action debut, having previously directed the animated movie ""Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs"" and the short-lived (but memorable) TV show ""Clone High"". The movie doesn't show any signs of inexperience. Instead, it shows a keen grasp of comedy along with enough technique to lend credibility to the parodies of buddy cop movies. The music is also nicely done with a score by Devo vet Mark Mothersbaugh supplemented by a well chosen soundtrack.All in all, ""21 Jump Street"" is a surprisingly good comedy, especially when compared to other TV show adaptations (like the similarly styled ""Baywatch""). Energetic direction, a self-referential tone and a pair of engaging leads make the movie work both as a comedy and a buddy cop movie. The sequel is also a worthwhile effort in the same vein, although in that case the self-reference struggles a bit to overcome the sense of 'been there, done that'.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Not the funniest film ever, but it was still enjoyable","One thing I have to say before actually reviewing the film was how terrible the screening was at the cinema. It was possibly one of the worst cinema experiences of my life. After the 20 minutes of adverts and trailers the room darkened and the screen widened, the film was going to start. Then however, the cinema decided to play the trailer for 21 Jump Street (Dir. Phil Lord & Chris Miller, 2012) just before the screening of 21 Jump Street. It completely ruined the film for me as the trailer contained many of the early gags of the film.Since the hit that was Superbad (Dir. Greg Mottola) in 2007, the comedy genre has been redefined with dark and sick humour taking forefront within films, with slapstick having surprisingly made a comeback as well. 21 Jump Street does not falter from the new codes and conventions established by Superbad, probably because Jonah Hill had a lot of creative control in both movies.The plot of this film is simple. Two kids that hated each other in school both join the police force and become best friends. Unfortunately they are such bad cops they get initiated into a revived program on 21 Jump Street, and a forced to go undercover as high school kids. This sounds like a very cheesy 80s plot that won't work. But it does. They updated it enough to connect to a 2012 audience, while at the same time keeping the cheesiness that defined 80s comedy.Jonah Hill in 21 Jump Street was pretty much Hill in every other film we have seen him in. I have to say, in some of is earlier movies I found his improvisation comedy refreshing and hilarious. Now, however, his jokes really haven't changed and his comedic style is becoming a little tedious, which is a shame. The real comedy star in this film was Channing Tatum, who actually fitted into this role with ease. I am hoping that his ability will improve with experience as he is a genuinely enjoyable screen presence.Some of the scenes are hilarious in this film. Notably a scene where they are both attempting to get drugs out of their system I found particularly funny. However, like many comedies nowadays, there are also some very unfunny scenes. I do not enjoy slapstick jokes in the slightest and I just do not enjoy films that rely on that form of comedy. I understand it exists to allow people to not think while watching the film and just to laugh, but I feel like it is a dated and child-like comedic form, and I much prefer intertextual jokes and witty dialogue.21 Jump Street is better than I thought it would be, but is not at the same comedic level as other hits like Superbad or The Hangover (Dir. Todd Philips, 2009). This film utilizes many forms of comedy, most probably to attract as bigger audience as possible; which is has. The acting is as it should be in a comedy film, apart from a cameo near the end which was mind-blowingly fantastic. 21 Jump Street has been a success as it has stuck to what people between the ages of 15-25 enjoy, which includes me. It was not the funniest film I have ever seen, but it was certainly not the least funny either.http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Has potential.,"I think this movie definitely has potential to be entertaining for the young folk like myself. Normally, I ignore types of movies like this but I love when Channing Tatum plays a funny part instead of people who cast him for the romantic mushy guy. He's too talented for all that. Unfortunately, this movie could also turn out to be a dud. It's hard to make a successful comedy movie. Especially coming up with new comedy's. It's becoming more hard to entertain people these days. I give credit to script writers who write a new and hilarious comedy movie. Either way, I think I'll be seeing this. I'm so excited to see Jonah Hill as well.

Highly amusing,"Highly amusing meta buddy cop comedy based on the 80s TV show, with laugh out loud moments throughout. Has no right to be as smart and funny as it is, but against all odds, this film is a winner.Tatum and Hill are Jenko and Schmidt, undercover at the local high school to 'infiltrate the dealers and find the supplier', as directed by Captain Ice Cube, who leads an impressive supporting cast including a young Brie Larson and Dave Franco.The two leads are fantastic with easy chemistry and some very funny scenes.

You'd  better be ready to jump,"Schmidt and Jenko (Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum respectively) are two newish bike cops whom are tasked by the '21 Jump Street' program with infiltrating a high school disguised as students and bust a new drug ring, in this comedy based on Stephen J. Cannell's hit late 1980's Fox cop show.Well this exceeded expectations, granted truth be told expectations were a tad bit low when I learned of a comedic rendition of a decidedly non-comedic TV show. However surprisingly the film is a great mix of low-brow, high-concept and self-referential humor that made it a joy to watch. With past Cannell shows hitting the big screen with A-Team and now 21 Jump Street, one can only hope that ""The Greatest American Hero"" would get the treatment next.

Has It's Moments,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to the big screen version of his TV Show 21 Jump StreetThis isn't my type of humour, but its not without its moments. A few scenes raised a smile, but overall it's just not my cup of tea. Depp has two small scenes alongside his former co star Peter De Luise (son of Dom Deluise) as their characters from the TV show.This movie reminds me of the Spice Girls, as their music is not my cup of tea, but if I hear a song of theirs on the radio, chances are, I'll be singing along to Victoria Beckham and co.

"Quite entertaining, didn't disappoint","Comedy is not among my more preferred genres. Its my choice mostly when I am stressed out or bored for refreshing my mind. Starting with 21 Jump Street I was ready to just have some fun whether it made much sense or not. In the end I was quite surprised the movie really invested me in its story not only catching with its gags. It starts off a bit slow but gradually transforms into a fun action- comedy ride.21 Jump Street involves story of two cop-buddies Scmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Chaning Tatum) who are assigned an undercover operation to track down drug dealers and suppliers at their own high school where they had studied. Schmidt is more of a nerd type while Jenko falls into cool handsome guy category still they became very good friends while training at Police Academy. Well there is nothing special about the story, its easy to see the direction in which its heading. Yet the movie is able to put forth a nice enjoyable chemistry between its lead pair. There were some moments involving both of them that were genuinely heart warming which was hugely surprising. Ice Cube who plays the head of the undercover division is also pretty entertaining. Additionally Dave Franco and Brie Larson have smaller roles as students. Romance gets added which wasn't quite the right tone. There is also lot of action with guns firing and car chases but its all balanced out nicely. Among the most funny scenes I would say was the whole driving-school car sequence. There were some really laugh out loud moments.In the climax there is stunning cameo which I did not see coming from any possible angle. I wont say a word about it, enjoy it on your own. The soundtrack and music suit the atmosphere and theme perfectly. But I felt a little problem with flow of the scenes, there are some sudden change from a comic aspect to emotional or romantic one. Lot of profanity is involved much of it seems to be there just to sound cool without making any sense. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller keep film nicely paced without much putting burden over the climax. In the end I wasn't disappointed and had some good laughs.RATING: [3/5]",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Nothing too original, but entertaining","While 21 st Jumpstreet is far from original, it was somewhat entertaining. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece by any means, but there rarely are any comedies worthy of anything over a 6 out of 10.What makes this movie a bit better than most of the cliché filled crap comedies with the exact same lines and jokes that comes out of Hollywood is the chemistry between the two main characters and how they complement each other.Since you cannot give any half stars, I'll have to give 21st Jump Street a 7.

Funny and entertaining,"Greetings from Lithuania.""21 Jump Street"" (2012) was a very funny movie to me back when it was released. Revisiting it now more then 10 years later I still found this movie to be funny and entertaining. Directing, writing and acting in this movie are very good - all these elements carried the otherwise silly material. Not all jokes lands, but most of them do. This is a raunchy comedy but it never goes way to much. I laughed a lot doing it.Overall, ""21 Jump Street"" is a silly story entertainingly told. Its excellently paced, acted and directed.

Simultaneously a typical and innovative comedy film,"Sticking closely to American high-school-movie tropes while simultaneously mocking them is one of the most salient triumphs of ""21 Jump Street"". Stoner humour is prevalent, swear words are numerous and lashings of typical US slapstick are shovelled in. By making two loser cops graduate high school again, ""21 Jump Street"" satirises the teen-scene film movement: Jenko and Schmidt have the ability to relive (respectively) the best and worst years of their lives, an opportunity which many would secretly relish. The interest in high-school movies throughout the 80's, provoked by a vicarious yearning to be cool or do things differently, is picked apart here as they realise that everything they knew about high school has changed. The athletic layabouts have been superseded in popularity by intelligent, sensitive and environmentally-conscious teenagers, much to Schmidt's delight and Jenko's chagrin. Their struggle to be accepted becomes more and more consuming as they begin to get distracted from their undercover mission, although any serious moments are often overlooked in favour of easy laughs. The film makes no secret of stupidity – the idiocy of the protagonists is exploited for full comedic effect as their bumbling Inspector Clouseau-esque investigations lead them, more by accident than design, to discover the distributors of high-school drugs in the wafer-thin plot. The shallow genre-mockery would be easily missed by the casual viewer, were it not for one of the best credits sequences I have ever seen: explosions, women's silhouettes and American flags cloak the screen behind a set of polished-metal acting credits in a flagrant action-blockbuster spoof. Self-mockery, showy cinematography and a poor (yet extremely quotable) script render ""Jump Street"" the ""Hot Fuzz"" of American comedies, albeit without the cult following.Music in the film is used primarily to add to the comedy, and although all actors are strong in their roles, there is a sense of tired cliché in the characters of Jonah Hill's awkward geek and Channing Tatum's brooding dullard jock. However, as a reboot of a long-forgotten TV serial, it stays true to its roots – references to the original series pop up in all forms, including the cameos of original actor Johnny Depp, even if most of the allusions would be overlooked by viewers unfamiliar with the series.There is more to ""21 Jump Street"" than meets the eye, but not a lot more. Its stand-out qualities are the subtle mocking of asinine blockbuster action-comedies, and the exploitation of the ""ideal high-school experience"" story concept. Other than this, the film is simply an enjoyable romp full of unpredictable violence and cringe- worthy awkward moments – and it is truly funny.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

reboot of 80s TV series - undercover highschool drug-bust comedy,"I didn't see the original 21 Jump Street (unfortunately) but love that Johnny Depp puts in an appearance in this albeit heavily disguised. This is a fun back-to-front bromance, a reboot of the 80s TV series which is comically mentioned, and a funny undercover at a highschool drug-bust scenario. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum star as an unlikely pair of second-time-around students but they work well together - and Ice T is the funny and irreverent ""stereotypical angry black captain."" Hill (Schmidt) and Tatum (Jenko) are both playing characters similar to those they've played before but step out of their character comfort zones, they're clearly unlikely buds and this is referenced to comic effect, as is the fact that times change and coolness is fleeting. Loved seeing Jake Johnson (New Girl) and Chris Parnell (30 Rock) playing (ish) straight roles. Some of the funniest interactions in this are between Jenko and his Chem Teacher Ms Griggs - LOL every time - and the two boys on drugs. Hilarious. It's funnier the second time around, like Pineapple Express (another Franco) funny, though with lots of similar sick references and homoerotic gestures, which I don't know the point of to be honest and don't find so funny, but there's lots that is super funny and Tatum's physicality (!) is very impressive.

21 Jump Street (2012),"A genuine surprise in quality and enjoyment. This is an example of a film where all the elements came together. 21 Jump Street is based on an 80's TV show, mostly famous for launching Johnny Depp's career. The idea sounds pretty ridiculous, wherein a group of young looking police officers go undercover as high school students. The film does well to turn this into a complete comedy. Tatum and Hill are old high school buddies that hated each other, as Tatum had fun bullying Hill. After school they both join the Police Academy, where they discover they can help each other out. Hill tutors Tatum, and Tatum trains Hill for physical stuff. A real loving friendship develops, but after an arrest goes wrong, they are shipped off to 21 Jump Street and asked to go undercover to discover the supplier of a new drug. The film hits just about every element of comedy it can. It plays on stereotypes, as Tatum and Hill are surprised to find students that care for the environment and are tolerant of each other. It also self parodies. The police chief mentions how they are regurgitating an assignment from the 80's, clearly nodding towards the film being a remake. Slapstick, clever dialogue, it all works. Tatum is perfectly cast, and like Wahlberg before him, seems to have a real gift for comedy. He excels by playing his usual jock self in full earnestness. Hill has obviously learnt from his acting chops being stretched on Moneyball. He i similar to previous characters, but knows when to dial it down. Their relationship carries the film, and we can easily understand their states of mind as Hill sees what it's like to be the popular kid. There are a numerous amount of stand out hilarious skits. One seeing Tatum and Hill getting high, and going through the five stages. It works better as a high school fish out of water comedy than it does an action movie, but even these scenes have their highlights.Funny supporting roles, exceptional cameos, and pacing that knows how to advance the plot, excite, build on characters, and make you laugh out loud, all at the same time. Perhaps one of the greats this year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Mindless action/teen sex comedy,"The movie sets the tone when Schmidt and Jenko attend the undercover induction in their full police attire.

Their lives meet again when the join the police force when they realize they have lack the muscle and brain respectively. When a college drug sting operation requires an undercover job, they both step in as students where they realize how changed they really are.Jonah Hill is a bankable comic actor who delivers mostly even with his routine characters.

Genius,"I'm not really one for U.S. high school comedies because they all tend to have the same plot with different actors (who've all had the same dentist by the way...) but I seriously nearly peed myself when I saw this.

Both Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum outdid themselves as the 2 totally immature undercover cops with things to prove from their own high school days and no clue how to do it.The understated facial expressions, comic timing and on screen rapport was excellent but looked effortless. Thanks to the writing of Jonah Hill and the production skills of the two main actors; this is a new genre of movie making...not quite spoof but in that region with a lashing of hardcore realism albeit tongue in cheek. I'm so glad Channing Tatum has done something other than the slushy romantic roles he was beginning to get typecast into because he's a brilliant comic actor. The script was excellent; Ice Cube's straight faced boot camp lines cracked me up and the plot and action were pretty good too.

A pleasant surprise,"Sometimes I find that the best films I see are those I know nothing about. Apparently, 21 Jump Street was based on a TV show from... (I don't know when, but it was, apparently). Anyway, I've never seen it, so I can't say how faithful the film was, compared to the TV series. Either way, it doesn't matter. The point is I knew nothing about the film and watched it anyway.And I'm glad I did.It's about two high school clichés - the nerd and the jock, spending their youth hating each other, only to become best friends when they both enrol in police training school. Then, after a botched bust, they're recruited by '21 Jump Street' to go undercover back to high school and crack a major drugs ring.Based on the plot, I would say it sounded average. However, it does have one ingredient that most modern Hollywood comedies seem to be lacking these days - it's actually funny! I don't know why it is, but it is. Something about it just works. I think it's best not to try and overanalyse a film like this. If you do, you'll end up finding plot holes and ripping it apart for no good reason.Just go with some adult humour and plenty of silliness (and watch out for the unexpected cameo near the end - okay, so if you know the TV series, maybe you're expecting it - but I wasn't, okay?).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Sounds like Hollywood in a nutshell.Everything from chase scenes to the buddy-cop dynamic to explosions faces the satirical scrutiny of the filmmakers and Lord and Miller play it up to the point at which it can neither be taken too seriously or blown off as immature twaddle.Hill and Tatum make a good duo, but Tatum's presence in the film makes it fresh. Unless you subjected yourself to ""The Dilemma,"" you've never witnessed his comic prowess. His combination of bravado, idiocy and deep-seated social insecurity as Jenko make him a real hit. Hill also works the full range of smart and awkward to totally outrageous.The script uses the brilliant device of having these two accidentally assume the high-school identity intended for the other, so Tatum has to hang out with the dorks while Hill must get in with the cool kids. A spot-on satire of how high-school kids have completely changed in just a matter of five or six years emerges here. Of our two high-school drug dealers, one cares a lot about green initiatives and the other is gay, which is not exactly in line with high-school stereotypes. At one point, Tatum profanely blames ""Glee"" for screwing up the once-Darwinian nature of the high school social hierarchy.As for jokes, ""21 Jump Street"" piles on crude humor, though usually with more effectiveness than most run-of-the-mill R-rated offerings. Seeing as Schmidt and Jenko must track down the supplier of a new synthetic drug, the movie offers more than a couple instances of drug- trip sequences, namely one in which Eric (Dave Franco, James' little brother) makes the two try the drug so he ""knows they're cool."" Given that the script explicitly states that the drug works in four main stages — one of which is ""tripping major ballsack"" — it builds up the humor more effectively.Immaturity abounds in the film, but with a wink and a smile. Except for maybe an older, slightly more ignorant audience, few people will watch this start to finish and not realize the filmmakers are aware of the dumb and silly moments in the movie. You can even see through the awkward quasi-romance between Schmidt and Brie Larson's character, Molly, because no one would find romantic catharsis in a budding relationship between a 25-year-old and high school senior.Like most modern comedies, ""21 Jump Street"" has a number of misses in spite of its many successful laughs, but the majority of them work, especially because in painting this typical picture of high school, it adds a few fine details of what high school is really like these days.Best, however, for those familiar with the TV show to divorce themselves from anything related to it, as the movie merely leeches off the name and premise, then tosses everything off to the side minus a few obvious in-jokes. It's typical Hollywood, but the self-awareness of this phenomenally goofy comedy sets it apart from its peers.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Exists in a world driven by two buddies and a formula, yet still finds ways to sidestep pitiful, unnecessary indulgence","We've come a long way in the field of satires, homages, and parodies, and I suppose that any hope for a straightforward, honest attempt at a film on the Fox show 21 Jump Street is out of the question. Sort of like how we'll probably never see a serious Sherlock Holmes film, since the current ones are very comedic and lack the sophisticated tone of the original shows. The new film, 21 Jump Street, is the R-rated, raucous take on a show that aired back in 1987. To modern audiences, that fact has little importance and is probably not even known. I'm sure some haven't realized why Johnny Depp shows up in a brief but charming cameo.I never watched the program, but know a great deal about it. I can say that the film explores the topic a lot more, using tactics only allowed in an R-rated film. Car chases, explosions, drinking, smoking, and the excessive use of four-letter words to name a few. It's nice to see a decent adaptation of a TV show from many years ago. After watching the lukewarm, unnecessary Dukes of Hazzard, I needed the optimism and reassurance that a successful TV show adaptation can be made.The film is centered on Morton Schmidt (Hill) and Greg Jenko (Tatum), who lived in completely different worlds in high school, with Schmidt being the stereotypical nerd and Jenko being the limelight-soaked jock. Eight years later, both have the same sort of personalities, but are both in a police academy. Schmidt excels in the writing portion of the academy, but flounders in his physical performance, and that's the direct opposite for Jenko. The two realize they can benefit each other in their slouching fields, and quickly become the friends they never thought they'd be.They become officers, and live a life well below modesty, patrolling a rather quiet park on bicycles. After miserably failing their first arrest, their boss sends them to Captain Dickson (Ice Cube, who scores some of the film's biggest laughs), an angry, vicious leader who helps disguise young-looking cops into high-schoolers so they can hunt down illegal substances being sold in a school and ""infiltrate the drugs and find the supply."" Schmidt and Jenko, perhaps, have too much fun with their new job and begin to break every rule possible, resulting in never ending camaraderie, chaos, and misunderstood circumstances. Despite this, the film has a way bigger heart than The Sitter, Hill's last film released in December, and Tatum handles his comedy debut very well, showing signs of a bright future in the area.The buddy cop formula has been beaten into the ground, and there doesn't seem to be much material existing to freshen it. Thankfully, 21 Jump Street isn't indulgent, meaning it's not always in the state where it believes it's doing something unique, passionate, or original. It knows it exists in a world driven by two buddies and a formula, so it decides to have a little fun with its premise and its off-the-wall, implausible ideas. It has the ability to make fun of itself, while still occupying confidence; a rare, often challenging trait to excel at today, and probably an even more challenging thing to accomplish from a new screenwriter. It just so happens, this is the best buddy cop comedy I've seen in years. Better than The Other Guys, and a lot better than Kevin Smith's Cop Out. And that is because of Michael Bacall's hip, witty screenplay that evokes excitement and laughter charmingly and not forcefully.Of course, 21 Jump Street doesn't find itself on the same level of some raunchy comedies, mainly Apatow's, like Knocked Up and Superbad. There is a bit too much of a focus on car chases, including one lengthy race at the end that sort of runs its course after a while. This is one of those cases where the action is coherently depicted, but the result is pretty conventional - despite the use of limousines. Even with that being said, 21 Jump Street is still a bag of bright satisfaction, with few weak spots. It's cheery, engaging, rarely becomes winded, and utilizes the functional blend of eventful debauchery with underlying sweetness and cheeriness. A lesson Project X should've learned and explored.Starring: Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum, Brie Larson, Dave Franco, Ellie Kemper, Rob Riggle, and Ice Cube. Directed by: Phil Lord and Chris Miller.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Only laughter,"I am not a huge fan of over-the-top comedies like these, but the movie was recommended to me by some friends, who added that it was the funniest movie they had seen in years. After this statement i was persuaded.The start of the movie was way too quick. You saw a glimpse of the high-school lives of the two main characters, who were the opposite of each other(the geek and the cool kid), and before you knew it they were cops and, most surprising, good friends. I could live with the fact that these are no in depth characters, because I did't had any expectations of a good thought-out storyline. I laughed several times, but mostly about jokes which had nothing to do with the story. And all those jokes were not part of a composite. Laughing was therefore the only emotional expression that occurred to me while watching the film. I find it very hard to see other aspects of this film worthwhile to discuss in a review. The movie's only purpose is to make people laugh and it succeeded on my case.That's why my vote is only based on the moments I laughed out loud: six times",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A Nutshell Review: 21 Jump Street,"It's looking like a trend now with animated film directors diving into making live action features, with Brad Bird successfully taking the Mission: Impossible series to new heights, while Andrew Stanton struggled to make the century old John Carter interesting and relevant. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, who were responsible for the film Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, brought the same enthusiasm felt from that animated feature into a series based on a premise that served as the inspiration for other films in film industries from Hong Kong's Fight Back to School, to India's Main Hoon Na by Farah Khan, and made it a pure entertaining ride from start to end. There was fine balance between the serious and the slapstick, and they just knew when to pull back rather than letting a running joke run stale. Things were kept simple, sticking to the well established background where youthful looking cops get into a police programme for undercover investigations into teen crimes, with the titular address being a church used as a front that the law enforcers operate from.And much of the credit goes to Michael Bacall and Jonah Hill's solid story, where they successfully interpreted the spirit of the television series, and updated it for a one-time (or perhaps more if this is successful) feature film. Keeping to the premise without trying too smart to deviate from it, and with tons of self-deprecating humour (the direct jab at Hollywood's lack of creativity is spot on and such a blast), the first few minutes had established what the new 21 Jump Street would stand for - humor and clichés delivered absolutely right that they still packed quite a punch. We're introduced to the new partners of Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum), opposites in character, one time high school fiends and playing off each other's strengths in their new careers, getting assigned to a high school to sniff out a drug ring which they then have to infiltrate the dealer network in order to get to the supplier. Sounds simple, if not for their covers being accidentally mixed up, that they relive the nightmare of high school all over again, with Schmidt being mistaken for the hunkier of the duo, and Jenko being thought off as the jarhead nerd. The standard comedy of errors ensues, from infatuated school teachers to a rip-roaring sequence when the duo had to convince that they are indeed druggies, subjected to the multi-stage after effects of the lethal HFS drug as it is called, complete with condom-like packaging and cute looking logo that says it all.References to other films, especially police and crime ones, were many, and hilarious, and the film doesn't take itself too seriously, preferring a fairly straightforward plot in order not to lose the audience through twists that stories these days just like to pile upon. Comedy also came from both Tatum and Hill playing with and against type simultaneously in their characters, with toilet humour rearing its head every now and then since Jonah Hill probably couldn't resist and succumbed to temptation to sneak in a couple. Vulgarities got used liberally and surprisingly doesn't come off as contrived efforts to elicit laughter, with Ice Cube playing it like a boss as Captain Dickson, the supervising detective at the helm of this revived police unit. Best of all there's still time for Jenko to get to know the new age nerds and get chummy with them - though I suspect there could have been more material here that had to give way, and for Schmidt to enter into a romance with fellow student Molly (Brie Larson). Dave Franco rounds up the recognizable cast given his doppelganger resemblance to older brother James Franco, playing a rich high school kid that I'd swear suggested at brotherly romance each time he gazes at Tatum's resident hunk.But the best thing in the film, other than the plot, is the chemistry shared between Hill and Tatum. It was clear that since Hill co-wrote the story, there was more focus on his character of Schmidt and his journey to come out of the shell and build some self-esteem, versus Jenko having to learn what it's like being the bullied rather than the bully, and becoming exposed as being a dumb jock at every turn, if not for his sense of loyalty to build upon. But when put together, they play off each other so well that you'll clamour for more of their screen time together, rather than going off on their separate objectives in the same mission. With heavy hints at bromance, this film probably won't be as successful without both playing outside of their stereotype, put in situations that milked this camaraderie to the maximum, challenging clichés which inevitably exist in the genre. I couldn't imagine any other two actors who can pull off what they managed to do with the film's premise and material.There's a much talked about cameo that happened, and fans of 21 Jump Street will probably acknowledge the attempts at closure for the television series, and the high-five passing of the baton to the new film version. It's a surprise package, surpassing what would be everyone's mediocre expectations of the film, only to come off pleasantly pleased at solid, mass entertainment. Highly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Shows that recycling old ideas can work,"Did anyone really want a modern update of 21 Jump Street, a cancelled TV show that ran between 1987 and 1991, a show that is only really remembered for being Johnny Depp's big break? The answer is, tragically, yes, it's the same people that watch tripe such as the recent remakes of Hawaii Five-O and Charlie's Angels, lapping up its generic story lines and unchallenging episodic structure. Thankfully, we're not going to have to watch two failed movie actors accepting a career in television (in the case of Hawaii 5-O), as 21 Jump Street has been given a full- blown movie, and rather than following the same tone and style as its predecessor, Jonah Hill and Michael Bacall have written as an absurd action-comedy, taking a giant gamble and casting heart-throb Channing Tatum, an actor that has looked more comfortable in recent years in action films and romantic comedies.Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) are two recent police graduates who became best friends in helping each through their own difficulties during the police examinations. In high school, just seven years earlier, Schmidt was a nerd who dressed as Eminem (""not-so-Slim Shady""), and Jenko was the long-haired popular jock. After a failed drug bust, the two are assigned to a recently re-instated program that was cancelled in the 80's (get it?), and are shipped off to 21 Jump Street to play undercover at a local high school that has seen an influx of a new hallucinogenic drug. To their surprise, they find that the politics of high school have changed, and now the nerds rule, and the jocks are the ones that don't fit in (Jenko blames recent TV shows, ""f**k you, Glee!""). With Schmidt seeing his new popularity as a way to re-live his high school days the way he would have wanted, his friendship with Jenko suffers, as does their drug operation.Given the recent comedy disappointments that have starred the likes of Jonah Hill and his posse, I wasn't expecting much more than a few titters from 21 Jump Street. To my surprise, the film is actually hilarious, thanks to a witty, smut-filled script, some fast-paced action scenes, and real chemistry between the two leads. It also plays out like a love-letter to the 1980's, where mismatched-buddy action comedies seemed to be out every other week, and is wise enough to be well aware of this, embracing the clichés of the genre (during a high speed chase, there is a nice running joke about vehicles not exploding as they would usually in movies, and Ice Cube plays the obligatory angry black captain - ""I'm black, and occasionally I get angry!"").Hill, love him or hate him (I tend to be in the former category) gives the performance you would expect - nervous, foul-mouthed, and wasting no opportunity to make a clever pop culture reference - and it's interesting how he makes the audience almost despise the nerd when we are so used to them being the sympathetic character. Tatum is the film's trump card, proving a brilliant comedy actor, and does not simply play the straight man to Hill's funny man. Jenko is big, handsome and stupid (in the opening calamitous drug bust he forgets the Miranda rights -""you have the right to... suck my d**k, motherf****r!), yet he has a big heart, bonding with some science nerds to both infiltrate a dealer and to learn about science.The jokes are about as crude and as vulgar as I've heard for a while. There are as many c**k jokes than there are sight gags, often blending the two together- a funny scene sees Jenko childishly doing ridiculous sex positions with a toy giraffe on Schmidt as he talks to his potential girlfriend on the phone. But if you can stomach the smut and would find the lead characters tripping their balls off on drugs funny, then there's plenty of fun to be had here, as at its core there is a lot of heart. Fans of the original show are in for a treat too, as there is an inspired revelation at the end, as well as homages and references to the series and the era in general (""I look like Fred Savage in the Wonder Years, only naked!""). A film that proves that taking an old idea and re- doing it can work, as long as your wise enough to make it seem fresh.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
One of the worst movies this year.,"I saw the advance screening of this movie and I don't understand why they took such an iconic series and turned it into trash. Tatum was lifeless and dull, and to be quite frank I don't think he commands an on screen presence to hold even a supporting role in a movie. He ruined GI Joe for me and countless fans and a few other movies I had expectations of. As for Jonah Hill his B grade comedy skills should be left out of Hollywood. They don't fit in this movie or this genre for that matter. Honestly, I wouldn't waste money watching this movie, its not worth even 30 minutes of your time. This was a failed attempt at capturing a series that Johnny Depp personified and its extremely sad that it was butchered into a cheap storyline with the sole intention of making money.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Seldom did I get interested in the plot, but the ""comedy"" part was OK, it wasn't brilliant, but laughable in a kind of good way. The plot was not just not interesting, but very poor, so do not expect the writers to come up with some major plot twist or anything that could confuse the audience because the only thing they do is putting some jokes to make it seems less bad.

GOLD! Why Do So Many People Hate?,"PREAMBLE:Let's start off with one thing: I have standards when it comes to comedy. I hate everything Happy Madison stands for (the company behind Grown Ups and Jack and Jill). But I don't understand why people hate this movie. When I saw it, I was blown away.The common complaint I see on IMDb is that the film's humor is immature. It uses too many ""penis jokes."" While I understand why some people don't like this form of humor, it doesn't make 21 Jump Street a bad film. And, while the comedy was never Monty Python, it never went overboard (except in one scene). But I digress.People act as if a film needs to be a British satire to be enjoyed. People are judging the film by its genre; instead they should be judging it by how well it tells an entertaining story. And boy does it do a good job.THE GOOD1)It doesn't take itself seriouslyHonestly, the fact that this film never takes itself seriously is probably the main reason why I found myself laughing the entire time rather than pointing out what would obviously happen next. It also leads to some clever jokes. Their Officer mentions the fact that the two protagonists are overdone stereotypes, that this film is essentially a shameless reboot of an unoriginal concept, and etc...2)Great ActionI hate films that are all action and no story (essentially I hate Michael Bay). That's why I'm happy that this film has only a few, but extremely memorable, action scenes. Really well done and entertaining.3)It's all about the chemistryThe chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is incredible. I found myself extremely invested in ""what would happen next"" even though I essentially knew the answer.4)The plotYeah, it's no Breaking Bad, but it works extremely well. What separates Grown-Ups from this film is a clever plot that moves the film forwards and gives jokes context. Even though I've seen this story a million times, this film made it feel like the first time.THE BAD1)The genreIf you don't like crude humor and the very-sight of Jonah Hill, or comedians such as Jack Black or Will Ferrell makes you want to vomit, avoid this film. It isn't for you.CONCLUSIONAssuming you're okay with crude humor, see this film. It's hilarious, action-packed, fun and dumb, with some sprinkles of intelligence.

The movie is comfortable being weird, it uses vulgarity but never as a crutch, it gives every actor a chance to shine, and it all works so well that you barely stop to consider that Schmidt's love-interest is a high-schooler (Brie Larson). The movie is good-natured but unapologetic in trying to make the audience laugh as hard as possible for as long as possible.

For the masses, the gross-out humor will be worth the price of admission alone. I am not above gross-out humor myself, so chin-chin.

not as bad as I thought it would be,"Since I have no attachments to 21 Jump Street the TV series and I strongly dislike Jonah Hill, I avoided this for a while. Picked it up today as a lark, and because I didn't see anything else in the video store particularly interesting as far as action movies go.

It's been a while since I've seen movie-making done with such glee at screwing with the audience. It was the best facet of the film, but I admit that I just like self-referential humor when done well, and here, that's what happened.That said, I couldn't get into the relationship between Hill and Tatum, and I still don't like Jonah Hill. However, I do like Channing Tatum more now, since he had the good taste to allow himself to be a complete boob when necessary here. With a little work, he might yet prove himself to be more than a lighter-haired clone of Josh Hartnett, with all the rom-com crap that implies.Huge parts of the story were absurd, so if that can't wash for you, then don't watch this movie.

What is so funny?Taught me not to believe  revies and IMDb blindly.,"The movie version of ""21 Jump Street"" was supposed to be a comedy, I guess. And I guess you would think it's funny if you love the same old jokes about penises over and over from beginning of the movie to the very end, literally.I thought the movie was going to show how two older, wiser guys go back to high school as undercover cops, and show those young kids what's up. THAT would have been interesting. Instead, they go right back to how they were as kids, bumbling and fumbling their way along, and doing a LOT of stupid things as well.The juvenile behavior the two leads exhibit ruins any dramatic elements of the movie. They don't act like two adults pretending to be kids, they act more like two kids pretending to be cops.The original 21 Jump Street with Johnny Depp was a good show. The movie version with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill was just dumb, sorry.This is easily Tatum's worst film, and I can't stand Jonah Hill. Hill is not funny, just annoying, and it makes sense that he co-wrote the script.You can tell Hill has no idea what a cool person is actually like, so he throws in about a hundred penis jokes, along with the usual drug and sexual comments, which take no imagination or creativity at all.

Channing Tatum is starting to get on my good side and he was very good here. He and Jonah Hill are very likable and have outstanding chemistry. However, Ice Cube stole the show. He has some very memorable one-liners and they still crack me up just thinking about them.Overall, this a totally unexpected surprise. I was not expecting much out of this, but I got a better film than most people realized. I'm so happy they were able to pull the film off. I guess they left a few surprises in here which pleased most people. I also like how I felt nostalgia because I was able to relive my high school moments all over again. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
I am in tears!,"It took me 10 years to finally watch this because most comedies of the past 10-20 years have failed to amuse me and turn out to be a waste of 2 hours that could have been better spent. What a surprise! I cannot remember laughing this hard, this often, at any movie. This is so well written, cast and performed. The surprise cameos made this extra special.

"Very funny, a little messy (+1 star for big Jonah Hill fans)","I found the first two thirds of this movie very, very funny. Jonha and Channing make a great team in quite an interesting take on a Highschool comedy.About every sixth word is a vagina or penis reference which may grate on some people.About two thirds in, the movie ramps up a notch and light situational comedy is replaced with shoot outs and car chases. This change in pace and action didn't sit well with the rest of the film and I found myself wishing it could have stayed the whole 100 minuets in the High School. Part of this is taste but I guess I am a little older than this films target audience(I had the same problem with the police in Superbad which, for many people, was the best part.)In all a very enjoyable, well crafted, funny movie but a bit haphazard for my liking.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Could have been a lot worse,"A better film than I thought it would be. I had never seen the television show upon which it is (loosely) based, so I had no biases or expectations springing from that. Jonah Hill has some real talent hiding behind the foul language and gross-out gags. I had never seen anything with Channing Tatum, so I do not know if his super low-key approach is the part or the actor. The pair have reasonably good chemistry together. The main hook appears to be how the two have reversed roles from their actual high school days, to their undercover assignment, and both seem to realize the emptiness and limitations of the other. And kudos to Brie Larson who looked great and nailed her role.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Re-defined comedy,With juvenile humor and extensive cursing throughout the entire film this comedy was abundantly clear it is for adults. The humor is suggestive throughout and the dialouge is written rather well. Jonha Hill and Channing Tatum are clearly hilarious together. Even the action sequences were put together nicely and humorous overtones.The scripts was also written by Jonha Hill and for something of this nature it was rather well done. Loosely based on the classic TV show of the 80's but all in all an good film. I would recommend this to everyone.I am sure there is going to be a sequel or two rolling off the original and if they are done as well as this one it could turn into a wealthy franchise.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Irreverent and hilarious,"What happens when you take an overweight, intelligent, socially awkward ""adult"" and put him in the same police academy with same emotionally stunted athlete who made his life miserable all through high school?Morton Schmidt (played by Jonah Hill) had dyed-blonde hair and braces in the twelfth grade so, naturally, when he attempted to ask out his high school crush, he choked and was shot down anyway. While this was devastating to him, Greg Jenko (played by Channing Tatum) found it hysterical and made no effort to hide it. The shoe was eventually on the other foot, however, when the principal revealed that Jenko (Tatum) would not be allowed to graduate. Years later, in the police academy, Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko meet again, they decide to help each other overcome their respective shortcomings and, in so doing, graduate. But a screw-up results in their first arrest being invalidated and, as punishment, they're reassigned to a program that was discontinued in the 80's and brought back because ""the guys upstairs ran out of ideas years ago"". Their new headquarters: 21 Jump Street. Under the direction of their captain (Ice Cube), they're sent undercover as high school students to find the supplier of a new drug that recently caused the death of a white high school student after he'd posted a video of himself under the influence of said drug and posted it on YouTube.The inside jokes about the basis for this movie being a television program from the 80's and cameo appearances from two former cast members are hilarious. Also entertaining is the sharp contrast in youth culture between today and ten years ago. Hill is basically playing a role he's played several times before, ditto for Tatum, and Ice Cube, playing a role that even the cast admits is cliché, is fantastic. If you haven't already, see this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
unexpectedly funny!,"First off, I don't normally go for comedies but as I find myself in LA waiting for a flight departing in 8 hrs I had a plenty of time on my hands. Went off to the local multiplex and found not much on, my choices were The Lorax, John Carter, 21 Jump Street amongst others. So I opted for what I thought was the best of a bad bunch and went to see 21 Jump Street.I had little knowledge of this film only that it is a update of an old TV show from the 80s and that it now follows more of a comedic route than it's origins. It stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as two young high school kids from the opposite spectrum of the popularity scale. Schmidt (Hill) is a geek who doesn't get to go to prom and is ridiculed by his fellow students whereas Jenko (Tatum) is the typical high school jock who is popular with everyone and believes he will be crowned the prom king until he finds he's is unable to attend due to his poor grades. So far so predictable.After graduation, they both enrol in the police force and Jenko spots the opportunity to team up with Schmidt to pass the police exam to become fully fledged police officers. They form a friendship and become partners. No plot surprises there, but what does come through is the two leads energy and exuberance. The two stars provide an engaging and very strong performance which I must admit caught me by surprise (especially from Tatum, who knew he could do comedy so well?).As they bumble through a routine arrest the police force believe their youthful appearance would work well in their special unit called 21 Jump Street. The main directive of this special task force is to infiltrate high schools and tackle a new synthetic drug being dealt to students. They embark on the undercover project and it's here where the majority of the comedy comes about. A mix up occurs and as a result they are forced to pretend to be one another's pre-assigned undercover identities, one an athlete and the other a science nerd and the previous natural roles undertaken in their own teen years are finally broken.It's safe to say the jokes do come thick and fast and there is many a moment when I found myself laughing out loud. What is surprising about the whole film isn't the actual assignment but the characters chance to relive their high school experiences and their journey to correct past mistakes and in essence play a different role. You begin to care less about the sub-plot of the drug ring they are suppose to smash and become more emotionally involved with the two characters predicament and self discovery.I can safely say that this film is an absolute blast, which is more hit than miss on the joke front. A film with little in they way of expectations has become a surprise hit as a result. So less said the better (sometimes a film's trailer will give away all it's best moments but there are so many great funny scenes it would be impossible to do this!). I was very impressed by Tatum as I would never have expected him to do so well in a comedy performance and if this was anything to go by, he'll have something else to fall back on if his tough guy action roles dry up.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Funny as...,"I am not a movie ""expert."" In fact, I am a latecomer to regular cinema going and I cannot compete with most on here for my knowledge of actors etc. But I do know funny when I see it, and this was it. I took my 15 year old daughter to see it and it's fair to say I have never seen her laugh so uncontrollably for such a long period. For my part, there were times when I had tears rolling down my face. The only reason I give it 9/10 rather than 10 is that I think the standard of humour dropped slightly in the latter part of the film, but that is not to say it wasn't still funny and I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants a good laugh.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Need New Rating for ""raunchy comedies""","Two Police Academy graduates go undercover to a High School to determine the source of drugs being sold to the students.Here we go again with Jonah Hill trying to be a comedian and it still doesn't work for him. Jonah Hill was Oscar nominated for his role in Moneyball and he did a great job. Do people who saw and liked Moneyball think they will see the same kind of Jonah Hill's character in these comedies? His Moneyball character (shy, quiet, intelligent, low-key funny, unsuspecting) is his strength and not this raunch. Is he looking at this type of comedy as a promotion?To compound things, the dialogues by all are riddled with foul language, crude and vulgar sex talk . The music had some raunch too and there are some raunchy sight gags that appear for no apparent reason. Things calm down quite a bit in the second half, but the language is still there. The car chases and gun fights make a Chinese Fire Drill look organized.What has happened to us? These alleged comedies are rife with all the above and they are never funny. Do we go to these movies to see if real comedy is coming back or do we really like all the raunch thrown at us?Keep in mind that the promos for these ""comedies"" never show this raunch, and although some promo clips are, indeed, funny off we go- unsuspecting - to the theaters and then become disappointed, angry and/or embarrassed. If the promos did show the raunch, would anyone go to the movies? Well, maybe 7th and 8th graders would as all this rocks their worldfor a while anyway.There seems to be an audience for the above so a new rating system is needed for these ""raunchy comedies"" as they seem to be here to stay. In the meantime I look at it this way: someone has to tell the unsuspecting that the promos are not telling the whole truth and they go at their own risk. But, many can Google the movie title and see what is really going on. Will they do it? Doubtful.I feel like I am taking a bullet for the many. Ahhhhh... the promos got me again. Who knew? See?

I love the idea for the movie, but the sequel is almost the exact same movie and I like it more. With the two adult men posing as high school students and even finding a love interest or two makes this one a little uncomfortable at times. The concept just seems to work better in the sequel when they take their bit to college.

Best film I have seen in ages.

Some of the dialogue was amazing, I found myself in fits of giggles throughout.The highlight of the film was when the duo were together, they really fed off each others personas.

Quite enjoyable.,"21 jump street must be on of the funniest films I have seen out of Hollywood in QUITE SOME TIME. Possibly rivaling 'The Hangover' (2009). It doesn't have much of a story line, but is similar to 'The Hangover' in that it is consistently humorous the entire way through. It's the kind of movie that you curl up in front of the TV with a pizza on a Thursday night and watch, effortless laughs continue throughout the movie, having said that it is not everybody's cup of tea. In parts you feel it is somewhat teetering on mediocre.

Buddy-Teen Comedy Brilliance,"I think we've seen the pioneering of a new sub-genre: a merger between a buddy cop and teen comedy film. Who isn't constantly on the hunt for something different? The filmmakers made it clear that they were keen to establish a gulf between the television series and the feature film; indeed, the film takes no more but the fundamental concept and premise from the series and laces it with almost slapstick, though mature hilarity which makes for one of the comedy spectacles of 2012.The story is definitely stupid but it's made to be that way. That was the storywriters' intentions, one of which was Jonah Hill himself. It's supposed to be exaggerated and have a silly, immature teen, high school wrongdoing element to it. It was like an 'American Pie' meets crime drama. For those raising their eyebrows, I did mention it was unique. Strange the way I describe it but take my word for it, it works superbly.The sense of humour is very juvenile and far from sophisticated. Any comedy associated with Jonah Hill means that you would be fooling yourself if you expected more refined laughs. I wouldn't say that this would have broad appeal, not least of all for loyal fanatics of the television show who may get the inch that all Tatum and Hill do is slander the '21 Jump Street' name. Hopefully, Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise's involvement will prevent that. All the same, it's raunchy, occasionally crude but brilliantly thought out with acting that works.On the note of acting, we do see some typecasting to some extent: Tatum in his stereotypical dimwitted, jock role and Hill in his overdone 'nerd punching above his weight' type role. They form an unlikely, almost unnatural duo representing the yin to each other's yang. Yet, they really surprise you with their fantastic, humorous chemistry; I wouldn't hesitate in saying that I would eagerly anticipate a follow-up with this pair in the hot seat. It's a credit to Channing Tatum that he really took the initiative and showed greater acting prowess in this clichéd role than we have seen from him. Jonah Hill is his usual self although sporting a new, streamlined look. That doesn't change the fact that he is becoming a comedian I would assume is beginning to attract a loyal fanbase. A special mention also needs to be shouted out to Ice Cube who returns to his element with an array of 'Ice Cube moments' which could only be criticised for brevity.This film is really a hoot, you'll derive some great hilarity from it. Don't however make the mistake of thinking you are seeing the next 'Lethal Weapon' or 'Rush Hour' as much as a derivative of 'The Other Guys' or 'Starsky and Hutch'. And don't watch it for any sort of intricate crime solving or spectacular action. Do however watch it for some juvenile pleasure.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
My Favourite Comedy Of That Year,"I'll start this review by saying I'm not a fan of remakes or reboots and generally don't even bother watching them.

This was my favourite comedy of the year. YES!!

not worth the 95 minutes of your life,"The sole virtue of this movie is the title (which you can find on DVD now), this mash up of Animal House, PCU, and Adam-12 is not worth the time to watch it! Life is too short to watch gifted actors in such wasteful parts like this mess. It is clear that Tatum O'Neil is here for the check and has no particular part to play but being a dumb jock. The continued sorry attempts at a fish out of water, or even a sad try at a buddy flick fall far short of believable (I do realize that this is supposed to be a comedy but I know too many stupid people in real life to waste time on this), and I cannot find it in me to even care about the sad plight of the high school nerd and the jock going back to school to redeem themselves.Foo",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Channing Tatum is FUNNY,"Being a big fan of Jonah Hill, when I first discovered this film I was cautiously excited. Now I can confidently say that this movie will make you laugh as much as any other. Jonah hill and Channing Tatum clearly have great chemistry on screen and their timing couldn't be better. I thought my man Jonah would steal the show and although his performance was great, it doesn't come close to Mr. tatum. Know as more of a sex symbol, tatum didn't seem like a great choice to go alongside Hill but boy was I wrong. See for yourself people, this man is hilarious.

A great action comedy,"Okay so I'm definitely late to the party with this review but with 22 Jump Street coming out soon I decided to go ahead and review this one. I first saw this movie a while back around the time it was first released but I had not seen it since so I re watched it last night. I was pretty glad that I did it was just as good the second time around. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have surprisingly good on screen chemistry you really believe that these guys are best friends. I really don't get all the hate that Channing Tatum gets. I mean Okay I get it he's Hollywoods pretty boy but that does not automatically mean that he is not talented.One big thing that I always look for in a good comedy is at least a little substance aside from just being funny. My favorite comedy movies have more to them then just a lot of funny lines. They have a decent story and cool relatable and likable characters and this movie excels at that. As funny as this movie is there is still a lot more to it than just that. The story of these two idiots trying become better cops by uncovering a drug ring is so entertaining. I also really like how this movie knows exactly what it it is. They even go as far as to make fun of the fact that this movie is a sort of remake of an 80's TV show though the two are almost nothing alike. It's really funny to see how originally in high school Cahnning Tatum was the popular one but the second time around Jonah Hill is because things just are not the same as they were in high school just a few years ago. Though The way school was that second time is nothing like my high school experience was which ended right around the time this movie was released.Another big highlight in this movie is the great action. I don't typically come out of a comedy movie thinking wow those action scenes were cool but this movie did a great job. The car chases are intense the shoot outs are intense and it's all really funny all the way through. So overall this movie had it all a lot of comedy, cool action, good acting, and good likable characters.I give 21 Jump Street an 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Since their chief finds them incompetent of doing anything right he sends them to Jump Street, where they will go undercover as high school students and find out who is supplying kids with drugs. Of course a series of events occur that provides plenty of laughs, more then I expected. Channing Tatum is fantastic and he should do more comedy.

"Hilarious movie that makes fun of everything, including itself","Going into this film, I was a bit skeptic. I'm not a fan of most American 'modern' comedies and I dislike high school comedies in general, so I expected to dislike this one to. But fortunately I was pleasantly surprised!The movie kicks of with both Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) in high school, were Schmidt is being the big loser and Jenko the super popular kid. Fast forward 7 years and we both find them training to be a cop. Since Jenko has the mussel but lacks the brains, he teams up with Schmidt who scores A's on the theory but lacks the physical strength. They both made it to be police officers but when they screw over their first arrest, because Jenko couldn't remember the rights he has to read to the guy he arrests :D, they are send to 21 Jump Street for a 'special mission'. Here we meet Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) who assigns them to be undercover cops in a high school, to act like high school students and find out were these new lethal drugs are coming from. Hilarity starts when they have their roles reversed and Jenko is stuck with the nerds and Schmidt is suddenly a very popular guy. Will the two still remember to actually act as cops and solve the drug dealer problem or just relive their high school years?The funniest thing about 21 Jump Street is that both Jenko and Schmidt don't look like teenagers at all which causes all kind of weird situations. It's hilarious when they try to blend in but fail utterly because it isn't 2005 anymore. I like how they mix typical high school humor with police movie clichés and make fun of both genres.I liked both Hill and Tatum in this one, there was good chemistry between the characters and they really looked like partners. The supporting cast also did a good job, especially Rob Riggle as the crazy Mr. Walters. I'm having the opinion that Ice Cube cannot act, but he was descent in this movie. And it was hard to screw up the part he had, just swear a lot should be easy for a guy like him, right? (He is also referenced in the soundtrack in the form of a N.W.A. track)The only problems I had with this movie is that I didn't like the parts were there is to much high school stuff going on and in the final act the movie get's slightly more serious. But the action scenes are great, especially the car chase with Jonah Hill dressed as Peter Pan.. :P I also could do with less dick jokes but hey, it's still an American comedy.. ;)So do check this one out if you could use a laugh and love to see some action as well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Out of Left-Field Comedy Riot,"First and foremost, the script and direction is phenomenal. All the absurd setup contrivances are winky jokes in themselves. The real surprise in this film are Hill and Tatum. Hill hasn't been funny since Superbad, and Tatum...what can you say about Tatum? I know the ladies like him, but he has about as much screen presence and engaging delivery as a moldy log. The chemistry between Hill and Tatum is astonishing, surprising, and enjoyable to watch. Hill seems back in comedic form, and it was fascinating to watch Tatum be something more than a 1 dimensional card-board cut out. Amazingly, Tatum carries just as much of the comedic load in this film as Hill. AND Hill is actually funny again, though he does fall-back to his mumble schtick a couple times.Rob Riggle totally owns his character in his signature style.The movie teases a sequel, which I am excited about, but 21 Jumpstreet 2 seems a bit of an unwieldy title...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

The only thing that made me laugh out loud was the credit scene ""you're like two hardy boys in one,""I just wasn't expecting it.

Review of 21 Jump Street: A Fresh Comedy with Entertaining Action,"21 Jump Street is a refreshing comedy directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, based on the popular TV series. Starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, the film follows two young cops who go undercover in high school to bust a drug ring.The film's greatest strength lies in the chemistry between Hill and Tatum. Jonah Hill brings his sharp comedic timing, while Channing Tatum, typically known for action roles, showcases his surprising comedy chops. The fast-paced dialogue and sharp humor keep the film entertaining without feeling forced.In addition to the humor, 21 Jump Street delivers some solid action moments.

"One of a Kind, Brilliant starter for the summer!","I have not laughed as hard in a long time for an action/comedy ensemble since BAD BOYS wrapped up back in 2003. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence although rumored to come back have not got on the BAD BOYS wagon as yet. Serving it clean with unmistakable talent, precision writing and ambitious direction 21 JUMP STREET is indeed a comedy hook, line and sinker. You will not stop enjoying this movie. High school stud Jenko (Channing Tatum) and slim shady look-a-like Schmidt (Jonah Hill) are clearly at two extremes on the popularity charts. Jenko who is banned from attending his senior prom due to the drop of his grades is furious. Schmidt himself will not be attending the prom since he isn't able to muster up his manhood to ask a girl out. 7 Years later Jenko and Schmidt run into each other at the police academy, buddies up, graduates and ends up on park duty. Forgetting to read the rights following their first ever hilarious arrest, both of them are reassigned to Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) who sends them undercover as high school students to bust a new drug; HFS and to bring to justice the supplier.Jonah Hill who is a well-seasoned actor of comedy and Channing Tatum not so much is the perfect match made in heaven (pardon the cliché) for 21 JUMP STREET. What plays to the greatest benefit of the movie is how amazingly brilliant Tatum turns out to be in comedy. Having turned down the role twice Jonah Hill convinced Tatum in playing Jenko and indeed turns out to be wise career move. When Tatum forgot to read the rights and when questioned by his captain to read it for him, Tatum utters ""You have the right to be an attorney"" simply cracked me up. This brings me to my point of brilliant story telling. The script is immaculately written. Michael Becall and Jonah Hills effort of the story is her strongest suit. It isn't stupid-funny like a spoof, instead it is relevant, realistic and quite appropriate to what goes on around us in the world of crime. Directors Phil Lord & Chris Miller ensures they keep it real. Gimmicks are reduced to a bare minimum while Lord and Miller stretch the talents of the actors, writers and themselves to keep the audience laughing.21 JUMP STREET is a must watch movie. Without any hesitation I recommend this and it will liven up your weekend movie experience. Remember how HANGOVER took you by surprise? How it redefined comedy and the way it's done?

21 Jump street: Watch 21 and jump watching this movie !,"21 Jump Street released with a movie of a similar genre ""This is war"" and boy that's what you call comedy.This is about 2 cops, one (Channing) a stud and one (Jonah) a dud. They both are given as assignment to go back to college as undercover cops and find the people involved in a drug racket.Both of them try their level best to make you laugh, but sadly the script and dialogues are so pathetic that they fail to not even tickle a bone. One of the idea worth mentioning is the 4 phases you go through when you have a drug called HFS. Ice Cube thinks he is one cool guy using the m*f* word. The other actors who just fit in this plot aren't worth mentioningIts very pathetic to believe that critics/reviewers have given this movie anything beyond 3/10.This one's where you blame it all on the script..Avoid and enjoy 'This is war'or 21 instead.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Scatological cinema at its finest,"""21 Jump St,"" based - very loosely - on the original series that made the universe and girls the world over aware of Johnny Depp, is a movie that approximately balances genuine low-brow humor with genuine scatology.Several times I caught myself doubling over in laughter; at least as equal were the number of times I was groaning and practically looking away from the screen in shame and embarrassment that I had just sat through something this crass, crude, and utterly shameless.Unless you're in a group of bong-hitting, backwards-cap-wearing frat boys - more or less the intended demographic of movies like ""21 Jump Street,"" ""The Hangover,"" and ""Old School"" - be cautious about who you share this masterpiece with. You might both be permanently damaged. This is not for kids, for sure.That said, are the good laughs worth the frequent trips to toilet humor? Probably.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum (is that a Southern thing? I cannot figure who would ever name their child Channing; that sounds like the name of a Southern gentleman who should be sipping mint juleps on their plantation house porch) are both good and up to the task. Tatum pulls off comedy very well. Hill is basically playing the kind of role you expect him to play - i.e., anything he's played in the Apatow movies is very similar.The plot is somewhat insignificant: The ""21 Jump St"" undercover cop duo of Tatum and Hill (could be a singing a duo, couldn't it?) go undercover in a high school to take down a drug ring. In a twist, Hill, who was supposed to play an undercover geek and Tatum, who was supposed to be the ""cool kid/jock"" - just as it was originally in high school - get accidentally switched and Hill ends up as the popular guy and Tatum - well, not so much.So... enjoy this for the occasional laugh and just skip it for about everything else.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

21 Jump Street is another film adaptation of an old TV show.,"Can we just appreciate the Tagline on the blu-ray cover: ""The only thing getting blown tonight is their cover."" It's poetry. For those of you who read my reviews know that I struggle with comedies, my humour is practically non-existent so I hardly ever laugh. I actually found this to be rather hilarious and laughed more than 3 times (I think that's a record?). It was good fun!! It knew exactly what it wanted to be and succeeded fantastically. A pair of police officers (who are the worst cops ever, no hyperbole) go undercover in a high school to bust a drug ring. This drug when taken has four unique phases which are portrayed on multiple occasions. They were funny as flip! Phase 2 is the greatest, massive props to the guy who envisaged those hallucinations. The story is actually well-rounded, the role reversal of our lead characters was a pleasant watch. The contrast of cliques from their past school life to the present made for some funny moments. I like the involvement of these cliques, the nerds were useful as opposed to just being picked on. The forced scenes of ""yayyyy friendship is important"" are quite cringe-worthy and didn't flow with the rest of the narrative. Channing Tatum was excellent, probably the first comedic role I've seen him in and he nailed it. Jonah Hill, who I notoriously dislike, was actually...dare I say...watchable. Now now, before you say ""you finally like him Luke!"" I still found him unfunny compared to Tatum, but he was tolerable. Brie Larson, Dave Franco and Ice Cube were also decent. A nice surprise towards the end as well. The action scenes were filmed with some exhilaration, particularly the limousine chase. I thought the editing had visual flair, reminded me of Edgar Wright. The soundtrack cutting out during a joke or the quick jump cuts to emphasise something (like the explosion opportunities in the freeway car chase). Honestly I didn't want to like this, but I had a really fun time and found it to be extremely watchable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill,"This movie kept me laughing the whole time. I laughed so hard about every 5 minutes of it. Whenever you see Jonah Hill in a comedy, you know he's gonna make you laugh uncontrollably. I don't see Channing Tatum as a goofy, silly actor. I see him as serious and tough. I really didn't expect him to be in a movie like this one. Anyway, they really made this movie a crack up. Those two acting as teenage cops makes me think they know how to take it easy on others who do bad things. Those two reminded me of will Ferrell and mark wahlberg in the other guys. It was weird to me when Jonah was laughing his ass off while having that knife wedged into his back. These two cops sure know how to take bad guys down and know how to party. way to go to them!!! :)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Film that is sure to get you laughing!,"With two iconic actors playing the lead roles the film is sure to be a hit!The opening scene really intrigues the watcher, catching their attention and making them want to watch on to find out what happens next, also to develop the characters.Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill both portray exciting and well developed characters within a serious message while the story line is written to show the seriousness of drugs and the issues caused by drug dealing in high school. This is shown in a comedic view to keep the viewers attention and to stand out from the typical undercover police drama.The film is funny from the getgo and although it has a lot of bad language, the language allows the characters to be portrayed more realistically then they would if they didn't swear, like come on, what high schooler doesn't swear?Overall although the film is set to be comedic about a serious issue it turned out to be a good film with a great story line and great character development. However this does not mean it deserves 10*, there were quite a few errors in rendering. For example when Eric gives Channning and Jonah's characters the guns, he can be heard speaking but his mouth doesn't move.Further more the story line is quite basic and typical of the high school story line where one character is bullied while one isn't, and for this reason i have chosen to give 7 stars, alongside the fact that the story line is predictable in some places.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

A very good entertaining movie...,"21 Jump Street (2012) ~umR ☛ 6.5/10 Directors: Phil Lord, Chris Miller Stars: Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum and Ice Cube 109 min - Action | Comedy Suitable: 15LVA very good entertaining movie...21 Jump Street is a big screen adaptation of 80s TV serial. I haven't seen this serial but I had a great time watching this movie. The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is brilliant, and it's nice to see Tatum in something other than his standard rom-com. Johah Hill, like always brings his trademark comedy in this movie too the only difference is looks thin! While saying that there are numerous time the jokes fall flat however,what really important is this movie keeps you entertained till the end and i guess that what matters..Overall, anyone who love to watch a fun-action-comedy movie or say ""usual Hollywood style"" Action-Comedy then this is it! 109 minutes of complete entertainment!STORYLINEIn high school, Schmidt (Jonah Hill) was a dork and Jenko (Channing Tatum) was the popular jock. After graduation, both of them joined the police force and ended up as partners riding bicycles in the city park. Since they are young and look like high school students, they are assigned to an undercover unit to infiltrate a drug ring that is supplying high school students synthetic drugs.My Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/unitedcbaMRCopyright ©2012 ~unitedcba.

I didn't like that movie but it has many great jokes!!!,"I didn't like that movie but it has many great jokes, definitely. I have never seen old TV series ""21 Jump Street"" with Johnny Depp and I can't compare its with the new version unfortunately. In my glance, main disadvantage of that film is vulgar humor that irritates me strongly. After every really funny joke next appearing three silly and it's regrettable because there are good plot, good actors but it seems to me some jokes in this film written special for morons. Why? I don't understand. I'm not a prude, I like Kevin Smith, American Pie for example, but everything should be in moderation and harmoniously. ""21 Jump Street"" is clearly not that case, unfortunately.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Undercover Brothers,"Who would have thought that Channing Tatum would be able to go toe-to- toe with one of the poster-boys of the comedic renaissance? Not I. Imagine my surprise, then, when the chiseled actor whose usual fare is penned by none other than the gloopy Mr. Sparks exhibits just the sort of deadpan snark that Jonah Hill is known for with expert craftsmanship. In fact, the pairing makes for one of the more memorable comic duos of the past several years, ranking up there with the Seth Rogen / James Franco collaboration that gave us Pineapple Express.The story is a rehash of an earlier picture starring Johnny Depp. Two young police officers are selected for an undercover operation at a high school. They're tasked with unhinging the distribution of a narcotic that often finds its users in the morgue. As the plot thickens, we see two individuals who occupied opposite ends of the spectrum during their first foray into the world of high school—one an uber cool jock, the other a nerd who's as socially awkward as he is smart—attempting to deal with the shifting roles that finds them embodying the other's niche in unexpected ways. In this way, 21 Jump Street is a ""buddy cop"" movie. This is great in that it reinvents many of the conventions of a fairly narrow genre, but it's also a detriment in that you know (for the most part) exactly what's going to happen by the end of the movie.The unexpected humor is what makes the movie a standout, though. It's worth your time to see these two ""bad boy"" wannabees reference a variety of films as they fumble their way through the hormone drenched halls of a stereotypical high school while gunning down drug dealers and upending the clichés of the genre with appropriate nonchalance. Though there are times where the gratuitousness feels a tad bit unnecessary, it's funny in that cringing-because-we-can't-believe-they-actually-went-there-sort- of-way. The fact that the two leading men are able to elicit laughs while sending up a multitude of well-known action flicks is admirable, and there's no doubt that anyone willing to give Tatum a chance as he embodies an atypical role will not be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Hilarious and Absurd: 21 Jump Street is a Comedy Gem,"21 Jump Street is a hilarious action-comedy film that keeps you entertained from start to finish. The movie's premise is a bit silly, but the actors, including Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, deliver their lines with such comedic timing that it just works. The chemistry between Hill and Tatum is undeniable and it's what makes the film so enjoyable.Yes, there are some moments where the humour feels a bit forced and the plot is far-fetched, but the overall experience is still highly enjoyable. If you're looking for a good laugh and don't mind some absurdity, 21 Jump Street is definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A Unique Approach To A Buddy Cop Story,"21 Jump Street looks goofy when you look at it's poster, i did not watch the trailer before watching this film, but as soon as the plot moves forward it starts to get a little better. The film has great comedic actors, which was the main reason I was hooked to watching this in the first place, and is handled by new directors which grabbed my curiosity.21 Jump Street's plot is not hard to follow, as found on most comedies, but what drives the film along is the references to either the TV show from the 80s or the life of high school students in the 90s. My main issue with the plot is that it feels forced and the writers didn't find a clever way to make it more layered and subtle. The characters in this film at least feel fresh, for the most part, and the film's dialogue does rely on being a little raunchy and unexpected. The buddy cop format has been tackled many times and they did just enough here to make it enjoyable.The film was directed by first time live-action directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, their first film was Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs. Their transition to live-action has definitely shown that they can take a material that has a high tendency to become very cliché and campy, and make it unique. The directors definitely wanted to push beyond people's expectations and make them think ""what the f**k just happened?"" while retaining that comic quality. The best qualities of this film is the tripping out sequence as it's really in your face, comedy that I also found in films like Fight Club. Lord and Miller kept the film at a quick pace, and i think this was a great decision because if it dragged even a bit, the audience can start to see beyond the surface of the film and find it's flaws. In delivering it's comedic timing, it relies on using sudden jump cuts that work only a couple at times.This film won't win any awards or turn heads on Barry Peterson's photography but it does get the job done. Not a moment I felt the film looked stale or cliché but it does feel generic and commonplace. Peterson and the directors loves to have shots focusing on the actors faces as the main focus of the film is to deliver the comedy, and a lot of the comedy comes from the delivery of the punch lines and the reactions to it.Mark Mothersbaugh's score here did not win me over. It felt lazy and uninspired. This would have been a great opportunity to create a score that feels over the top and trippy, as this would complement the style that Lord and Miller was going for.One of the other highlights of this film is the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, as they play each other off well and bring personality to these characters in order to prevent them from being stereotypical and one-dimensional. Hill and Tatum's banter is fantastic but the dick jokes does get a little old at times. The dramatic moments though did feel a little over the top from them and I wish a little more came from their performance. Brie Larson is the love interest of Jonah Hill in this film. Larson is fantastic in this as she plays it cool and at times do feel like a high school student from this generation. She was a great casting choice as she is more cute and girl next door type rather than those stereotypically sexy high school girls. Dave Franco was great but nothing different from his other performances like in Scrubs. Rob Riggle did surprise me though as his improvisation in his lines are clever and does catch you off guard. Ice Cube was definitely over the top and did bring down the film a little bit, his comedy just didn't hit me as it did with the others.21 Jump Street doesn't break any new ground but it does have enough to be enjoyable and at times unique. I definitely did not expect the comedy that would be presented in this and it did a great job in keeping me interested until the end. I'm interested to see the sequel but I hope Lord and Miller correct their mistakes from this film with 22 Jump Street.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
the popcorn comedy of 2012!,"Last week, I caught the new David Ayer movie End of Watch, an impressive first-person cop movie, with a gooey buddy-cop heart. 21 Jump Street is similarly derivative (it's premise is based on a forgotten eighties TV series), but it knowingly accepts the standardised rehashing culture of Hollywood; subverting the clichés and conventions of it's heritage and make them work for a contemporary audience.Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill star as Jenko and Schmidt. Meeting back in high school, they were polar opposites: Jenko was the hot, dumb jock, and Schmidt the shlubby dork, with Slim Shady hair and an inability to keep his cool. Seven years on, the pair enrol into police academy and soon realise that they are the perfect combo of brawn and brain. It's the start of a beautiful friendship, but a flawed park patrol team.After a failed drug heist, they are sent to work undercover with the self-proclaimed ""stereotypical angry black police captain"" Dickson (Ice Cube), who runs the down-town Jump Street program. The no-nonsense law enforcer sends the hapless pair undercover at a local high school to bust a drug circle selling a dangerous new chemical high.The ridiculous scenario would make for mundane screwball comedy material (think Never Been Kissed, or Miss Congeniality), but writers Hill and Michael Bacall – the second of which penned the excellent Scott Pilgrim vs. The World - elevate the scenario with a comment on the fickle American teen culture of today – where the cool kids are tolerant eco-warriors, and geeks' chatter of covalent bonds is admired.Hill and Tatum make for an amiable team.There's no straight man, and the pairs constant to- and-fro bromance rekindles some of the magic between Nick Frost and Simon Pegg in the British comedies Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead. The support is great too, most notably 30 Rock's Dr. Spacemen/SNL ensemble man Michael Bacall as the high school's irreverent drama teacher. During a reflexive overload, there's an incredibly plotted cameo from one mega- Hollywood star once affiliated with the original series, with a TV in the background playing one of the show's classic episodes.As is expected, 21 Jump Street has it's fair share of crass dick-jokes, gross out moments, and implausible car chases. Just like their brilliant animation adventure Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller rifle through the jokes at such a breakneck speed that they are able to shift between the tones of sincerity and self-deprecation effortlessly.I'll admit it, I snubbed 21 Jump Street when it was released earlier this year. Who needs another cliché buddy-cop comedy? Who wants more of Jonah Hill's chubby funster schtick? Aside from teenage girls, who wants Channing Tatum, period? To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. 21 Jump Street has no right being as downright hilarious as it is, but the universally strong comedic performances, frantic pacing and a taut script make this the best popcorn comedy of the year.Read more reviews at www.366movies.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"You people are kidding us with these highly rated reviews, right?","I wanted to like this movie. I enjoyed the original series and so thought I'd give this a shot since it was available on one of my OnDemand channels. As I see it, the single biggest problem with this movie is that it was Rated R; so the people who are the correct age to enjoy this thing are not old enough to view it, and those that are old enough to watch it will not enjoy it. I will admit I laughed two or three times, but the boring times in between them far outweighed those tiny chuckles.This movie repeated commits the greatest sin, that is people not reacting to events like a reasonably intelligent, poorly educated person might. Every character in this thing is dumber than a bag rocks, the dialog is awful, and the plot is incoherent. Had I gone to the cinema to watch this dog, I would have been force to walk out before the halfway mark, and demand my money back.I promise I will die before I watch another movie, TV show, or video in which Jonah Hill had anything to do with the writing or production. The fact that so many people liked it, and wrote glowing reviews is either evidence that some people are paid to right false good reviews, or it is a further sign our civilization is rapidly approaching its ultimate demise due to the unfathomable inanity of the average voter.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Funny- to the point of Tears,"I waited for 21 Jump Street to come to the local video stop and after watching it, I will not do that with the sequel that is coming.This was the first film that I have seen Channing Tatum in and he was great. I am not a fan of his looks (I know, I know) but what impressed me is that for a so call 'pretty boy' he made the film. Tatum has the look of a rookie policeman and definitely the look of the jock in high-school so the casting was spot on. I did not expect his acting ability with his funny one lines, startled facial expressions and mingling with the computer nerds- he clearly is out of place in those scenes, but he makes it work somehow. Bravo Mr. Tatum.Jonah Hill I like- to a point. I enjoyed him in 'Moneyball' and thought he was a likable slacker in 'Superbad' however, in '21' his performance seems almost forced? I think, and it pains me to say this, that Tatum out smarted him and out shined him. Hill walks the line between wanting to be the cool kid for once and being the nerd, which is one of the plot points to the movie. Hill did not fall flat at all, he just was not his usual hilarious self that I have seen in other films and I think it was a missed opportunity for him to a certain extent. The relationship between Hill and Tatum is excellent and somehow Tatum is the one that pulls the weight.The minor characters I enjoyed, especially that of cutie Dave Franco. I did not go in to this movie knowing all the supporting characters, but I really like his performance, the prom scene is particular great. Franco is not just a pretty face, must run in the family. Ice Cube was hilarious as the captain and the few scenes that Ellie Kemper was in were great.The only problem that I thought slowed down the entire movie was the last scene in which the cameos occurred. I know that a lot of people were excited to learn of the famous cast of '21' appearing in the new film, but I thought it was not needed and only put in there for those of the older generation. I am not in this school- '21' was not on the air when I was growing up so I thought it was really weird that these few cameos were necessary.There is a lot of swearing, reference to drugs and alcohol and a few quick scenes of sexual situations and one ridiculous sexual scene that was added for shock I guess. This is a film for the older young adults.Great cast, great music, great concept of moving on and letting go of life in high school.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Finally something that can stand up next to Superbad!,"I didn't see any previews and therefore had no expectations for this movie, but 21 Jump Street had me falling out of my chair laughing. I am so glad I saw this one in theaters, because comedies are best enjoyed with lots of people laughing right along with you. I thought Tatum and Jonah were comedy gold and executed their lines perfectly. I love that this movie called out the new generations of kids and their weird trends that don't even make sense. They referenced the old show, and even had a big surprise cameo at the end that had my theater screaming with delight.It's about two high school rivals who become best friends when they join the police academy. They get sent undercover to a local high school to uncover a drug ring for a new type of drug being introduced. They end up rediscovering themselves in a hilarious journey. If you liked Superbad, this movie might finally live up to your comedy expectations.

Don't judge this book by its cover,"21 Jump Street's presentation really does not give the movie much credit, but the old ""never judge a book by its cover"" applies here. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are two young cops that go undercover in high school. Yeah... Well, it's hilarious. Everything you would expect from a cheesy premise like that really does not happen. This isn't the classic American Pie's high school anymore, even making fun of the tolerance that characterizes youth nowadays, and with a very good dose of dark humor, unbelievable situations and characters, and a very special cameo. 21 Jump Street makes fun of itself. Very well written, this is probably one of the best, if not the best, comedy of 2012. Who would guess?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

The biggest and most entertaining laugh-riot throwaway film of the year.,"Moonrise Kingdom and Silver Linings Playbook aside, the year has been dry for laugh riot comedies. Now that Judd Apatow is more-or-less scraping from the bottom of the barrel, we've been waiting patiently for someone else to take the mantle. That hasn't come yet and 21 Jump Street is nothing new, but it feels like the comedies of that peak era of foul-mouthed comedies in 2007 and 2008 with Superbad and Pineapple Express. Based on a TV show I admittedly haven't heard of, I assume they did a good job of updating it for the modern age as it's very entertaining with some great original jokes and ways of delivering them with pleasant surprises. Although it dives into its narrative with not as much development as I'd like it to have, in particular I'd like more on the bonding of the two lead characters, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, it's their bromance and great chemistry thereafter that makes the film something a little more special. Misguided special effects and an awful antagonist aside, 21 Jump Street is certainly one of the most entertaining films of the year, especially above the humourless action movies of the summer.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Channing or Jonah - Both are Surprisingly Hilarious,"You have to do a lot to get me to laugh out loud at a comedic movie. Slapstick, ""stupid"" humor will not tickle my fancy or come anywhere close. Shock value and foul mouthed comedians will not get me to crack a smile. Blonde jokes, white jokes, black jokes, one-liners, gay jokes, and political satire will barely scratch the surface when it comes to comedy. However, 21 Jump Street found a way to my fancy.Jonah and Channing delivered an outstanding comedic performance. I'm sure many were hesitant to see this one, expecting a flop by Channing. But this was not the case, Jonah was in no way comically superior to Channing. Their chemistry was natural, the kind of chemistry that makes straight men look gay. Happens all the time to Boon, Ol' Garrey, and myself. Its chemistry, nothing more, nothing less.The writing was well executed with minor adjustments needed to the tasteless cursing and overdone scenes like a shot off limb (the extra limb). There were moments where the movie's cool was about to fizzle, but it jumped write back into sizzle.

Enjoyable Police Comedy,"First I want the reader to note that the community ""average rating"" is a seven so I liked it a bit more than everyone else did. Not being part of the 1980s pop culture, that obviously enjoyed the TV series, I seem to have enjoyed the movie for what is was meant to be. The movie is a hilarious police comedy. The TV series (what little I saw of it) was a dull action drama with teen issues and teen fans too.This movie parodies a lot of the typical things we see --far too much of-- in today's action films. The movie shows two young men who despite being polar opposites join the police academy to see action, explosions, car chases, and bullets flying. Yes, they join for all the wrong reasons. After their first big bust, they are assigned to 21 Jump Street because 7 years after high school they still look very young. But they are assigned mostly to be punished.The acting is above par for this kind of film. The dialog and plot are great. The gags are over the top. It is funny to see two adults return to high school after 7 years to find out nothing is the same as before.

"""Let's stick our fingers in each other's mouths!""","21 Jump Street (2012)-There are probably many fans of the original series that hate this film, but I haven't laughed so hard in ages and I needed that.

A few scenes of him in the shower or something is all that could have improved this one.The banter and camaraderie between the two leads is hilarious. An unlikely pairing of police officers at any time, this ""Brains"" and braun couple ultimately end up finding a connection that proves capable of doing the job and how they get there is brilliant and complimented by an excellent supporting cast. Ice Cube in particular is awesome.It's actually harmless, mostly because it takes the mick out of everything. It has innuendo and breaks the fourth wall in clever ways. The writers knew what they were doing.I personally think that releasing a film more true to the original TV series, would have been too hard to believe in an age where people seem to want more realism. The concept even in the 80's was a bit of a stretch, so making it a comedy was the right choice for me.Such a good laugh and accessible for everyone, but don't watch it too often or it might lose its power to make you speechless with laughter.949.03/1000.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
21 Jump Street: a remake worth the watch,"Given that this film is just another in a long line of Hollywood remakes that don't need to be remade, as well as it coming from directorial duo Chris Miller and Phil Lord whose only previous feature is the questionable Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs, it is safe to say that I was feeling pretty dubious on entering the cinema. However I emerged at the end feeling more than pleasantly surprised with what turned out to be a fun, fresh and hilarious buddy-cop movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.Once natural enemies in high school, jock Jenko (Channing Tatum) and nerd Schmidt (Jonah Hill) find themselves together in police academy and decide to form a mutually beneficial relationship in order to pass their exams. It's the classic exchange, Jenko needs Schmidt's brains and Schmidt needs help in the physical department. Upon graduating, the pair make a spectacular cock up of their first arrest and consequently land themselves in the 21 Jump Street programme. For those who have heard anything about the TV show will know that the programme specialises in young looking cops going undercover to unearth youth crime in high schools and the like. The pair are understandably critical of their new posts (who wants to go through high school more than once?) and the film is humorously self-referential making fun of itself when the operations' leader (Ice Cube) rants that the unit is a just rehashed plan from the 80′s because the higher ups couldn't come up with anything better.

Funniest flick of 2012 so far.,"About 15 minutes into this laugh-fest, Ice Cube's straight-talking Captain Dickson explains to young coppers Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill – two ""Justin Beaver lookin' motherf...s"" – that the Jump Street unit is a revived undercover police program from the eighties that has been resurrected because the men in suits can't think of anything original anymore. It's an unsubtle dig at Hollywood's fascination with remaking old T.V. shows, but it highlights the movie's tongue-in-cheek intent loud and clear: to take a cherished part of America's television history and make it bloody hilarious. It succeeds. Not only do the gags (a fantastic blend of self-referential humour, physical comedy and witty one-liners – all often vulgar and truly earning its MA15+ rating) come thick and fast, but they hit more often than not, and those that fall flat are quickly forgotten such is the rapid rate of jokes. Hill (who also co-wrote) and Tatum prove to be a fantastic mismatch too, with the latter especially impressing in his first fully-fledged comedy role. 21 Jump Street is the funniest flick of 2012 so far.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Not funny but it is stupid and boring,"I'm giving my opinion about this movie from a grown adult perspective, so maybe through my eyes I have a slanted opinion when viewing movies such as this. That being said, I'd have to say that if you are over the age of 18, this so called comedy movie is not for you, if you are under the age of 18, maybe there is something in this you might find entertaining. If dumb, stupid, mindless comedy so predictable a grade school child could of written better sounds like fun to you, then by all means watch this movie. For the rest of us who want something more, I suggest you keep looking for something else. Let's face it, good comedy is difficult because what one person finds funny another may not. If you want funny, try ""Bridesmaids"", and/or ""Horrible Bosses"", these are examples of movies that will make you laugh, 21 Jump Street will make you sleep.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
21 Jump Street Reviw,"21 Jump Street was surprisingly one of the funniest movies I've seen in a couple of years. I was expecting to walk in to the theater and watch another over-advertised comedy with no substance. I don't think I've laughed that hard at a theater in a while. The chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is brilliant. They play the roles perfectly as undercover cops going on a mission as high school students. This was one of Jonah Hill's funniest roles right next to Superbad. I was surprised to find that Channing Tatum actually has a sense of humor and I actually liked his performance. This is another one of those comedies that are acceptable to quote out in public at a certain moment. Definitely should be recognized in the future as a classic. The only thing that I found that I didn't like about the movie was that it was just a little too long towards the end. Yes it was still funny, but just dragged on a little too long.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
HILARIOUS Movie!,"I'm not going to lie, I was pretty excited to see this movie and had high expectations because I love Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum is pretty good too! Plus I have never seen the TV series, and I know a lot of people didn't want to see this because of the TV series but I am glad they came out with this movie! I went to TWO screenings of this movie. I said why not it's free and it was movie worth seeing twice! The whole movie from start (with the real slim shady playing in the beginning) to finish was amazing! It was everything I could have asked for in a comedy/action. The acting was great and the story was hilarious! The two main actors worked very well together, I was pleasantly surprised with Channing!

at least the 7.4 rating is funny,"this is an objectively abysmal movie, there's just no way around that. it isn't even mildly funny unless you're maybe 6 or 7 years old. although jonah hill certainly has his awkward teen schtick down, the movie is just a bad rehash of what's been done a billion times before but with new people. no one expects these dime-a-dozen summer teen flicks to break new ground all the time but jeez, at least try to make something marginally entertaining since not all moviegoers are 10-year-olds.I should've stayed away based on the red flags so it's not like I wasn't warned. usually though when your expectations are so low it's hard to be let down but they did it with this one. I never saw the TV show and don't even know if that was a comedy so it's not like I'm comparing this to memories of that. I thought jonah hill was fairly awesome in superbad (a close 2nd after mclovin) and liked him in the russell brand English rocker movie. but I saw the high IMDb rating on this one (7.4 or something like that) and figured I was missing a new napoleon dynamite or something.wrong. in the real world this movie is a 3 or 4 at best. maybe sit through the whole thing on a dare but for anyone else you'll do more yawning and checking your watch than laughing or even cracking a smile for that matter.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
very funny movie,"I will start by saying this movie is hilarious. There were several laugh out loud moments in this movie, and the entire theater was laughing in several parts. The chemistry of Tatum and Hill was completely spot on, and made an excellent team. The overall of the plot was definitely very solid throughout most of the film. Towards the end it kind of let up for a just a little bit, but picked it back up to finish how it should have, which is as funny as it began. Sure there were a few moments here and there that could have been better acted out or written and such. Ultimately though this movie is a comedy, and combines the best of both worlds of some raunchy with excellent slapstick humor. This is a movie I will be seeing again in theaters, and anyone looking to have a good time and just have a laugh this is a must see. I will admit I never saw the original or had any idea what to expect coming in, but am very pleased I saw this film. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Funny and Many Ways,"When i 1st seen the preview for 21 jump street, i wasn't so happen with the fact that they turn a great kick ass show in to a movie that was going to be a comedy. Most of the time when i see a preview for any type of upcoming movie i run to look into it on my IMDb App ( Thanks for having one IMDb) But i just didn't do it with this movie. I didn't see this movie coming together after knowing how the show was. I felt they took a great show and just wanted to remake it for some money because they couldn't think of anything new. Ohhhh Boy this movie was freaking great. it was so funny i didn't want it to end. It was just to funny and had a good story line in it. now Jonah Hill you no is one funny guy and a good actor so i wasn't surprise with him.

Chix Chat on Film review: So much more than the TV show.,"I had low expectations for this film, which is very typical for me when a movie is made based on an old television series, especially so many years after the show is off the air. There have been some successes like Star Trek, and the complete antithesis in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. But, I just figured that the funny scenes from the trailer were about as good as it gets. I was so misguided. There were so many zany happenings throughout 37 Jump Street (you'll understand when you see the film) that I realized I was laughing out loud or had a smile on my face pretty much from the Slim Shady beginning to the plug for a sequel ending. This film painted a picture of how a friendship developed for Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) from within the Police Academy to being partnered for the Jump Street project and it only took a few scenes for the audience to know exactly who these characters were and their history together. I liked that the development of their relationship to present day was not drawn out or made more important than it really was because once they became partners the story just got funnier and funnier. The overly exaggerated angry Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) aided my understanding of embracing stereotypes, the running joke of an impending explosion was both funny and exhilarating, and the whole Peter Pan play made for some of the funniest scenes in any comedy lately. Even though I knew from the trailer that there would be a mention of how old Jenko looked to be in high school, it was still funny when delivered in the film, since the real joke is that in many High School themed movies the actors are too old to play teenagers, here rather than ignore that fact it was embraced. There must be some very potent thespian DNA in the Franko family, Eric Molson (Dave Franko) was played to a tee as an overindulged neglected teen, but with the sensibility of today's biggest plight which is conserving our ecology. The revelation of how much High School has changed was also interesting to say the very least. I have to say until viewing the film I did not even realize DeRay Davis (Domingo) was in it, and before he said or did anything I was cracking up over his tats, you have to really be a bad, bad guy to have a bucket of tears. The only expectation I went into the film with was to see who would return in a cameo, that expectation was met and then some, especially to learn that someone could be right under your nose and you not even know it. I give 21 Jump Street a green light.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"OK, but not for fans of the original, intended for the brainless/sophomoric comedy fans","I really don't get the the Jonah Hill thing, I don't find him/his movies very funny nor am I into the raunchy teen sex films that seeem all the rage, so I avoided this in the theater. Then, one day, I was on a plane, and since I loved the original series, I decided to watch it......If you think of it as a satire of the original show and remember that it's probably aimed at 14 yr old boys, yes it's kind of funny.However, since what I really liked about the original show was that they took these matters (homophobia, bullying, teen prostitution, drugs) seriously -- turning it into a comedy was rather jarring.Things I was disappointed in: the other 2 main characters, Holly Robinson & Dustin Nguyen's characters were not mentioned at all, I guess the two other sneering officers shown for about a minute were supposed to represent them? Ice Cube's role was turned into nothing but gratuitous swearing that added no value to any of his scenes. (were they trying to say that's all that Cpt Fuller did?)Things I was creeped out at: Jonah Hill's character falling for an underage HS girl was super creepy. Gratuitous sex scene at party of supposedly underage kids being show - ultra creepy. The fact that these supposed officers of the law would raided the lockup to then provide alochol & drugs to kids. I know they're portrayed as stupid & that they were just trying to fit in, but it was so unrealistic & stupid it was jarring.Parts I liked: When they discovered that values at school had changed and dumb jocks were no longer popular and that intelligence and environmentalism were valued. The cameo by ""Tom"" & ""Doug"" (even though it was during a very dumb scene) The inside jokes to keep an old-school fan amused (naming a character Jenko, Korean Jesus, etc.)",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Hilarious but not suitable for children,"When watching this movie, it was one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. However, the language and sexual content are not suitable for children. At the theater, I witnessed at least a dozen children under the age of 12. Even one of the parent's said that they thought it was a mistake to bring their kids during the movie. However, they didn't leave. Strong sexual content is not suitable for these children. Please be aware parents of the subjective nature of this movie. After watching, I felt the sexual parts were added and were oddly inserted without cause or comedic relief. If they completely edited these parts out, the movie would have still be the funniest movie I have ever seen.

A good movie...?,"21 Jump Street (the series) is notable for just about 1 thing: Johnny Depp, who's matured into an interesting actor. How 21 Jump Street (the movie) rates these glowing reviews is beyond my comprehension. It's dumb... the central characters are not believable as cops or high school students. The plot--- what there is--- involves infiltrating a designer drug operation. The best that can be said about this mess is that it's ---slightly--- more coherent than most other idiotic TV show retreads (Starsky & Hutch being the crap standard against which I measure them all).

There is not one piece of intelligent dialog, only swearing and vulgarity.I didn't find the movie funny, I found it to be vulgar which is very disturbing.The movie is not good and shows how low lives of society have become actors and have no acting skills or any piece of intelligence.The movie could have been good without the obscenity and vulgarity that the movie has dished out.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"""21 Jump Street"" - Surprisingly good, I'll jump to see the sequel!","If ever there was a sequel to Superbad in which the characters grow up to be cops, this might be what it looks like. Here is the rare raunchy comedy (like the aforementioned Superbad and American Pie) that also has wonderfully likable characters and a rich heart at its core, beating with life and laughter. Jonah Jill and Channing Tatum are an incredible comedic duo as two rookie policeman, and the joy of their first ""successful"" arrest spills over onto the audience, and it swirls around with a manic energy for the rest of the film. 21 Jump Street is based on the classic television series starring Johnny Depp about cops going undercover at high school. Here, Tatum and Hill are looking to crack a drug ring! This film isn't merely an adaptation however, it takes humble shots at itself and is delightfully self-aware. Directors Phil Lord and Chris Miller, of Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs fame, bring with them that same sense of visual overload and smart CGI into a few scenes that are so hilarious my abs still hurt.

A Mockery,"Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) are inept rookie cops. The chief assigns them to an undercover squad comprised of young looking police officers who pose as high school students. Their first assignment is to infiltrate a burgeoning drug ring selling dealing what's called HFS.The last time anyone saw Hill in a feature film he didn't look anything like this. It's obvious that 21 Jump Street was filming somewhere in-between his recent weigh loss. Scholars could looks back at this as the initial phase of Skinny Jonah Hill, and from all I can tell a dire career move. A healthy lifestyle is important, but when you're a young actor with a lofty gimmick it's advised you stick with it.Our other lead, Tatum, is far outside his comfort zone of dancing and combat roles. As one of the few who saw last year's The Dilemma I assume you Channing Tatum had no ounce of comedic timing in that film. Instead of playing the foil to Hill, Tatum's Jenko is also represented as a comedic character. Shockingly dumb, he can't remember the Miranda warning. But not only are the leads played up as fools, every breathing character in the film's world has been dealt the same surreal card.Punchlines and sight gags abound in what sounds like a serious plot. The YouTube demographic gets service through the colorful titles that appear during the phases of a HFS high. They're weak efforts but do offer sheer numbers to overpower less analytical audiences. In the past I have indeed found myself falling into the laughter along with the crowd, much like how the peer pressure gets to the students of this movie, but the closest I could come to mustering but a smile came by a quip from Ice Cube of all people.Back on track with the story. High school has changed a lot since our heroes graduated in 2005—if you can look at them and buy that. What made Schmidt a nerd now makes him part of the cool crowd. Sports are all but shunned, leaving Jenko on the outside. This might be the surprise of 21 Jump Street that is to say if the film offers one. It took some guessing to identify the drug supplier, more a fault of the bizarre writing—there isn't an adult figure in the school who cares about the well-being of students.Despite sharing a title and cameos from the most famous leads of the series, 21 Jump Street bares so little in common with the TV show that the only comparable films is the unrated home release of 2005's The Dukes of Hazzard. 21 Jump Street is one lowbrow, violent, swear-ridden, manic flick that's as mature as its director duo of Phil Lord & Chris Miller.21 Jump Street is without shame, even going to the extent of taunting the audience with its referential nod toward the remake/reboot movement. Even speaking as a non-fan of the TV series, I find the mockery overbearing. It's not simple enough to say they flipped a TV drama into a teen comedy, they flipped it into a particularly crude one.Check out my video review at site VaughnOnMovies.com",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum bring their infectious comedic chemistry to engulf us for a hilarious good time,"Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum band together in what appears to be yet another remake of a popular TV show of the same name. After a significant number of failed attempts to bring a televised source material to the big screen in an accurate fashion, it is understandable why people may approach this with low expectations. Against all odds, Hill and Tatum manage to bring their A-game to the table with their feverishly strong comedic appeal to grip us for an insanely hilarious comedic fare. Playing a duo of undercover cops with a diminishing sense of intelligence, these two make an irresistible pair for this devilishly raunchy buddy cop comedy directed by the likes of Phil Lord and Christopher Miller who make a remarkable achievement of paying tribute to the popular source material while taking many liberties that create only a minimal resemblance of the 80s TV show. It is a movie that demands you to prepare for an all-out laugh-out-loud galore. This film follows Schmidt (played by Jonah Hill) and Jenko (played by Channing Tatum), two men reuniting seven years after their high school graduation to attend a local police academy. While their graduation is success, these two prove to be way too amateurish to properly execute their jobs at law enforcement officers after they manage to botch their first arrest. This leads to their boss Deputy Chief Hardy (played by Nick Offerman) to transfer them to, wait for it.....21 Jump Street, an underachieving police department run by the foul-mouthed Captain Dickson (played by Ice Cube) who assigns them on a case that sends them back to high school as undercover cops disguised as students to bust the school's drug dealer who happens to distributing some mind- altering substances. As the duo becomes engulfed in reliving their high school days including partying and school plays, their social life with the fellow students put their jobs in danger.This movie is not quite devoid of the typical buddy cop formula that has dominated the subgenre for the past few decades. But with the brilliant sleight of hand by the directors Phil Lord and Christoper Miller, a a solidly executed script, and the comedic adrenaline of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum; this movie works astonishingly well. It is funny almost consistently and rarely lets a single moment go to waste, even when the jokes border on the line of distasteful. And each time Hill and Tatum appear on screen, laughter almost immediately dominates the air as their chemistry allows us to relish in each scene. The script effectively blends its raunchy R-rated sex humor with clever messages about high school popularity and friendship, which come to productive use when the two leads get mixed with a crowd of high school cliques. In particularly, Jonah Hill's Schmidt forms a romance with cute blondie named Molly, played by Brie Larson, which comes to his surprise considering his lack of popularity in high school as demonstrated in the opening scene with him and the then-super- popular Jenko. Furthermore, the film also makes effective use of poking fun at high school stereotypes which accounts to some good laughs every now and then. But most importantly, it is the comedic performances by Hill and Tatum that keeps things flowing. And kudos should also go to Ice Cube who brings his foul-mouth, wise-cracking fever to the screen each minute we see him, and Rob Riggle who lets his comedic talent shine nearly every chance he gets. And when the characters finally get the chance to pull their guns out in the climax, viewers are treated with a sweet little cameo.21 Jump Street is an exciting comedic endeavor that shows that Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum make an effective team when tackling the buddy cop genre. The movie is funny, charming, and blisters with seemingly endless comedic fever that will, of course, turn off those alienate by a long line of raunchy humor that comes at almost consistently. If can withstand the crudeness, come along for the ride.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Surprisingly funny and much better than expected,"As of late there have been few movies that have made me laugh. Specifically comedies that have been able to make me laugh. Recent comedies haven't really been funny and usually require gross out humor to be funny. But 21 Jump Street is a wonderful exception. The movie is funny, entertaining, and it's an overall good movie.21 Jump Street is a continuation from the original series back in the 80s-90s. What surprised me a bit is that the movie actually recognizes the original series and that understanding the original series is important for one of the greatest jokes/cameos in Hollywood history. Most people were confused as to why I was laughing so hard because they hadn't watched or even known about the original 21 Jump Street.A nice thing about the movie is that the characters a likable. Comedies with annoying characters are unbearable but this movie has a good cast of characters who I genuinely felt concerned for. The duo of Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was shockingly good. The two played their roles perfectly and it was really nice to see the character development between the two. This was yet another surprising element for me because most comedies don't try to have any important character development but this movie actually succeeded in doing so even though it's not going to be anything like Citizen Kane. It was still a nice addition.Overall I really enjoyed the movie. The jokes were funny, high- schoolish, and inappropriate but it never used gross out humor and never needed to use nudity or anything in that realm for its jokes. A refreshing comedy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A true killer...,"Before I recommend this to everyone, forget about the fact that yes, it's a rehash, and yes, The Sitter was lackluster. Moving on, 21 Jump Street is, without a doubt, the funniest movie I have seen and you will have seen in a long time. To list all the strengths of the film take up a lot of time. So I shall start from the start. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum (who has finally found his calling) are both dead serious and painfully hilarious at the same time as high-school foes turned cop buddies. Both have their share of sharp one-liners and outrageous antics. But their characters seem to help each other out with Schmidt (Hill) as the highly intelligent but painfully nerdy geek and Jenko (Tatum) as the strong and handsome but somewhat dim-witted jock. Both join the police force and quickly become friends by using their strengths to overcome the other's weaknesses.After failing to arrest a gang leader, the two are sent to the undercover unit known as ""21 Jump Street"" which utilizes youthful officers to be sent back to high school. After accepting their first assignment given to them by their hard-ass, overly-clichéd boss,(Ice Cube), they head to the local high school with the job of infiltrating and bringing down a new drug ring. The drug is known only as H.F.S (what do you think that stands for...) and possesses some very weird and very funny side-effects.What happens next is not just a gigantic laugh-fest, but also a satisfyingly entertaining roller-coaster ride which includes but is not limited to: A car chase that breaks all the rules in the handbook, a nightmare party that not even Project X could match, a cameo and the shocking identity of the supplier.The first-class humor is a combination of wittiness, gaggery, foul language and grossly sexual humor as well as a ton of insults that no show is safe from.If you just forget the fact it's a rehash and brace yourself for the unpredictable and brilliant humor that will follow, you WILL be rushing to the doctors, screaming for pain-relief and depressants, all the while laughing uncontrollably.An easy 9/10. Minus a 1 for the poor choice of music at the party.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A Genre (And Character) That Is Slowly Dying,"There are some parts of ""21 Jump Street"" that are funny. The trouble is, they are all very predictable and evidence that this genre of film (begun by ""Superbad"") may be beginning to die.For a basic plot summary, this film sees two rookie cops given an undercover assignment back in their old high school. Schmidt (Jonah Hill) was the high school loser now turned cooler, while Jenko (Channing Tatum) was the high-profile jock who now has trouble reclaiming that identity.Like I said, there are a few genuinely funny moments in this movie. Unfortunately, they are very few and far between. This type of comedy has been made so many times that it is almost as if the jokes can be seen coming from a mile away.It doesn't help that Jonah Hill's ""trying to escape adolescence"" character might be starting to wear thin after a number of similar flicks. In all fairness, he does provide probably the funniest gags of the film, but it just isn't quite as funny as it used to be.And then, of course, there is Channing Tatum. Women will likely give this film a full star higher rating just by looking at his sculpted physique. Men, on the other hand, will probably be more likely to recognize how wooden he can be at times. He isn't a total loss, but he won't be nominated for any Academy Awards anytime soon.Overall, ""21 Jump Street"" is the typical crude, profane, & stupid comedy seen a million times since ""Superbad"" had such great success. That genre is (or at least should be) on its way out.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A fun script,"So a guy named Schmidt, played by Jonah Hill, and a guy named Jenk, played by Channing Tatum enlist in the police force's Jump Street unit. There they are able to utilize their youthful appearances to go undercover at a local high school.They soon discover that high school isn't like it was just a few years ago. OR maybe it is.Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum do a fine job of bringing out their own youthfulness in 21 Jump Street, which very much helps the fun script. Two directors are credited with this movie - Phil Lord, Chris Miller, so I'm not sure what that is all about. But given those circumstances the movie survived. 21 Jump Street probably stands to make a lot of money in the long run as it is one of those movies where you just want to not have to think to hard.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A Great Movie,"I never thought I would like a movie where Channing Tatum was in it. He was actually the main reason why I liked this movie, he had to change quite a lot and he did it really well. Jonah Hill was just the same funny guy. I laughed so much while watching this movie. This movie is basically a modern twist on the old '21 jump street' television show. It's a ridiculous movie but you will love it. You will think that it is another silly action movie however you will be wrong. There was a little to much swearing but I didn't mind. This is a definite must see. If I go to a friend's house I will make them watch this even if they think that Channing Tatum will be crap. This is high school comedy and high school comedy is nearly always funny. I really do recommend it you will be surprised about how good it is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Maybe the FUNNIEST comedy to date,"What can you say? Comedy GOLD. 21 Jump Street is one of those rare comedies where you laugh all the way through.I always make fun of bad high school comedies because the lead actors look like 30-year old people still going to high school. In 21 Jump Street it is on purpose that Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are way older and it makes for some hilarious scenes.And thank god it's been a while since we've had a good buddy cop movie. It's all thanks to the casting. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if everyone found out that this movie just came out of filming Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill for 5 hours. They must have had the time of their life making this movie.The only critique I have of this movie is the romantic angle as it felt somewhat forced. However, it makes sense for the movie to have a partly serious premise as it will draw viewers who like the rom-com angle and probably was the only way to sell the movie to the studio.Just watch this already if you haven't!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Refreshing,Entertaining and very well done","i don't know how to begin, but 21 jump street was very well written and directed. every actor was great. when the movie starts you think to yourself....man not another teen movie....but when it kicks up to 4th gear in the next 5-10 mins, you then tend to even forget that it is even a movie and you get sucked in at once. this movie was entertaining and interesting to say but the least and i was very satisfied after watching it. in fact i just had to watch it again to be able to memorise some of the very cool and hilarious scenes. Chanum and Jonah did very well in their roles and all i can say is that they couldn't have picked any one better to act those roles. my man ice cube too was also excellent...he was very believable in his role and one takes him very serious the minute he comes into the camera. so to you out there if you haven't watched it or you are now contemplating as to weather to watch it or not, i say go watch it at once for u wont regret it. i give it 9stars of 10. this is definitely one of my best movies for this year. i am going to watch Batman rises tomorrow, i hope it will be great like the reviews are saying.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Just another comedy; has nothing new!,"Movies like '21 Jump Street' are like the run of the mill comedies we have in Bollywood. They completely lack novelty but are worth your money for the laughs. The film is based on the TV series of the same name that launched Johnny Depp and has now turned funny-man Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum into producers.Shmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) are from the same school but hardly ever got along. While Shmidt is plump and a nerd, the latter is a Jock. Both end up joining the police academy and emerge as buddies, helping out with each others weaknesses.Since the duo has youthful looks, they are sent undercover as students to a local school to bust a drug ring. And then follows the usual humor as they get into school plays, some romance and run-ins with the drug lords while they also deal with an expletive spewing boss, Captain Dickson (Ice Cube).In a way, it reminded me of the Bollywood movie 'Main Hoon Na' which had Shah Rukh Khan getting into college as an undercover guard to one of the students there. Just like in '21 Jump Street', the former too had humor and romance. There is also another Hollywood movie with a similar story; can't recollect the name though!Jonah Hill is best remembered for his role in 'Superbad' a comedy on a high-school party theme and his latest act in a supporting role in the Oscar nominated 'Moneyball'. But, his best achievement is shedding pounds by the dozens to suit his character. Tatum, also a regular face in collegiate humor flicks is fine, but nothing exceptional.'21 Jump Street' has already garnered good international ratings. Remember, the US release was more than a month ago. But, don't be dissuaded by those ratings or rave reviews; let me assure you that this movie has nothing new. At best, it qualifies as a pastime flick on TV; but not worth a trip to the silver screen.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
decent,"Not many people of today's generation realize that this was a TV show! People of my generation remember it fondly though. This was a decent ""update"" of the show as former high school foes graduate from the police academy, screw up a drug bust, and get assigned to the newly revived (re-jumped?) jump street program, and their first assignment is to infiltrate a local high school by their overbearing chief to investigate a drug bust. Of course, it isn't as easy as it sounds.Overall, I think this is a decent movie with a decent blend of drama, comedy, action, and surprising (and amusing) cameos. The drug taking scenes are hilarious. See the old TV show if you're not familiar with it. You'll like that too.** 1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Hilarious albeit in all the ways you've seen before.,"Looking at 21 Jump Street simply from it's promotional material it appeared to be just the typical cliché undercover cop comedy that we've seen before. Having watched it, is it? Well yes but it stands out for celebrating it for what it is and not insulting the audience. We have our two leads the good looking one and the typical nerd like fat one. They knew each other in school and couldn't stand each other, now they are friends as adults. Again not unusual in the slightest but the film succeeds in constantly throwing jokes that you don't really have too much time to notice the clichés. They go undercover the infiltrate a new drug craze in a school and inevitably they end up succumbing to the drugs at some point as well as enjoying themselves a little too much. There is of course the meta humour involved with mentions of 'an old program brought back from the 80's,' didn't get too much of a laugh in my particular screening but made me chuckle. And let's face it by the time you've sat down to watch you've only yourself to blame for not knowing what's in store. The film has decent performances from our two leads but in my opinion the stand out was Channing Tatum who just seemed to be more naturally funny in the role. However Jonah Hill's actions did bring more laughs at times. There is plenty of action and you more or less need to pay attention as there almost seems to fit in more jokes at these points to go along with the fast paced sequences. Other characters were decent and it was funny to see our leads attempt to fit in with the changed high school personalities from their days. This was where Channing Tatum particularly stood out. All in all it comes down to many things you see coming but learn to have fun with it enjoy the silliness and you may enjoy. It has beaten recent attempts at buddy cop comedies hands down.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A fun ride!,"Having been a fan of now-almost-forgotten TV drama ""21 Jump Street"", the series that launched Johnny Depp's career, I was rather hesitant to attend a screening, yet, could not be happier that I went. The movie reprises the series' concept, yet, does it in a new, fresh way. Both Tatum and Hill sell their roles without a hitch. Hill, playing a typical high-school loser, is reincarnated as a high school jock due to a case of mistaken identity, while Tatum, the former jock and class underachiever, is too funny as no longer popular school nerd.The entire movie is a series of sight gags, yet, the jokes are done intelligently and in good taste, without ever being a joke upon itself.All in all, a great fun, with special treat of bit part appearance by Johnny Depp at the very end.A ""must see"" for full blown belly laughs!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

It was full of typical American clichés and nothing new was bought to the film. I definitely wont be going out of my way to watch 22 jump street.The story line itself was just really predictable and the film is catered for very young kids and teenagers.

Classically Funny,"21 Jump Street is a brilliantly funny movie which I would absolutely recommend to anyone with a good sense of humor. Seeing an overweight Jonah Hill with bleached hair and white t shirt looking like Eminem, develop into a policeman on a bicycle kick starts this movie as funny from the get go.Whilst I'm not that familiar with the TV Show this movie is a great date movie with enough of a love angle to keep the girls interested, yet never ending laughs for both males and females to enjoy. Some of the jokes may be overplayed, but this only adds to the comical value of the movie as a whole.The movie plot is straightforward, set with two cops going undercover in a high school.One typical nerd from his era and one typical jock, these roles are quickly reversed in the new school setting. The story unfolds with a classic high school drama and love story backed up endless laughs. The key part of the movie is based around brotherly love after a much expected 'boys will be boys' fight. As the story moves on, the new drug they are assigned to investigate becomes the main focus. Ice Cube playing the commanding police officer adds more comical value to the movie every time he talks.The cast involves some interesting choices with Channing Tatum not renowned for starring in funny movies; however he embraces the challenge well. But let's be honest the man who holds this all together is none other than Jonah Hill. Every so often an actor comes along that is genuinely funny; someone who you know as soon as you see them on the big screen they will have a long career. Jonah Hill is this man for me, he looks funny, talks funny even walks funny everything about him is funny. Ever since I first saw him in Superbad I knew he was something special. Doesn't matter too much who is on screen with him they are lucky to have him there.This movie gets 4 stars out of 5 for me, a movie filled with great comical value and very entertaining. Enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
It's Good If You Already Like Action Comedies (I don't though),"Two cops go undercover in a high school to try and stop drugs.It's a pretty mindless action comedy, and I would argue it's pretty good for its genre.

Probably the biggest highlights are the cameos from the original 80s series. However, I don't know a single person who watched the original series, so these Easter eggs are probably lost.If your looking for a decent action comedy, feel free to pick it.

"Hilarious, One of the Funniest of 2012","I was only a few years old when the original television show hit the airwaves, so I only know the original as the show that starred a young Johnny Depp. That's about it. I had little interest in seeing this movie until the reviews started hitting the web and touting it as a lot funnier than I would have imagined. I still haven't gotten over how horrible THE SITTER was, so Jonah Hill was not high on my list of must-see headliners. And the only film I'd seen Channing Tatum in was G.I. JOE, which isn't exactly a comedy (well, not intentionally). But I was wrong to doubt them because 21 JUMP STREET is the funniest movie I've seen so far this year. This is 21 JUMP STREET for a new generation; specifically, a generation that isn't necessarily familiar with the television show. The premise is the same: police officers infiltrating a high school. But it's done with a modern sense of humor and an edge. Schmidt (Hill) was always a loser in high school, a bleach-blonde Eminem wannabe without an ounce of style. Jenko (Tatum) was your typical obnoxious jock, popular with the students while neglecting his studies. After graduation Schmidt and Jenko, find themselves enrolled in the police academy where their opposite talents (Schmidt's academics and Jenko's physicality) lead them to become partners and best friends. They're soon transferred to Jump Street where they are sent undercover at the local high school to flush out the dealers of a new drug called HFS. High school should be a cinch this time around, but things have changedThis movie could have easily gone in a terrible direction. It could have been a tired rehashing of the same old material and been lazy with the jokes. The premise makes it an easy target: a buddy cop movie set in a high school. Sure, there are some jokes you might see coming here but 21 JUMP STREET does what it can to spin your expectations. From the start of their investigation, things go wrong when Schmidt and Jenko accidentally swap their new identities. So now Schmidt has the sleeper classes and Jenko finds himself tackling AP Chemistry. Now each of them is dropped into the opposite clique from what they originally experienced in high school and must continue to blend in. It opens up a hilarious new set of gags for the movie when Schmidt is finally the popular new kid on campus, a position he cherishes a little too much. Jonah Hill has redeemed himself for THE SITTER and he's back in true form here, while Tatum has proved that he's got some great comedic acting chops. Honestly, Tatum has some of the funniest scenes in the movie. And the two of them have great buddy chemistry together. Jonah Hill shares a writing credit on this movie, so I have to give some respect to him for putting together (with Michael Bacall) an awesome action/comedy that excels as both genres.Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller have collected an excellent supporting cast for the movie including Ice Cube, Dave Franco, Brie Larson, and Rob Riggle. Cube is the angry captain in charge of the Jump Street unit, openly embracing the stereotype of the angry black captain (he worked his a** off to become captain and, yeah, he gets angry sometimes). Larson is the ""sort of"" love interest for Schmidt when he gets in close with the popular kids. And then there's Rob Riggle, a man I have yet to see fail at being hilarious, as the school's P.E. teacher Mr. Walters. This movie is loaded with laughs, and one of the few movies I actually laughed out loud at this year. The action scenes are surprisingly well done too. The movie has it's share of car chases and gun play, and it's always played for laughs. From the beginning, Schmidt and Jenko want nothing more than to be the sort of cops they see in movies and TVjumping away from explosions with guns blazingand by the time the movie is over, they'll be living the dream. 21 JUMP STREET is an easy recommendation for anyone looking for a solid comedy with a dose of action. There are even a few cameos in the movie to satisfy fans of the original television show even if people like me don't catch any but the best one near the finale. There's really enough in 21 JUMP STREET for fans and non-fans to enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Laugh-Out-Loud Family Fun,"Pros:
1. The comedy is of entirely laugh-out-loud quality and it never fails to produce a laugh.
2. The film knows when and how to appropriately insert tender moments which add to the dynamic between the two protagonists.
3. There is fantastic chemistry between Jonah Hill (Schmidt) and Channing Tatum (Jenko).
4. Both Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill give brilliant comedic performances, with Ice Cube (Captain Dickson) offering up a very good side performance.
5. The movie does a good job at presenting the changes between high school generations, especially with Schmidt and Jenko finding themselves in inverse social statuses to the ones they had assumed in their high school days.
6. The score, though nothing special, performs well to add to the atmosphere it's played in - whether it be during an action scene, or an emotional one.
7. Both Schmidt and Jenko have nice little character arcs with Jenko becoming more knowledgeable and responsible, and and Schmidt becoming more confident and freer.
8. The pacing is great despite it's paper-thin plot.Cons:
1. Somehow Schmidt and Jenko pass for high-schoolers even though they look way older.
2. The film sets up a bizarre romantic relationship between Schmidt and Molly Tracey (Brie Larson) even though it's wholly inappropriate considering the age-gap.
3. Some of the editing is a little obnoxious.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Surprisingly good,"I was a bit surprised at how much I enjoyed this. I don't know if it's because i'm a bit older and remember the original, or it was just funny, but this was well worth the price of admission.This one was a bit like a summer blockbuster a bit early. Not too deep on the plot, but just a lot of fun to watch. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum played off each other surprisingly well. The film does a good job of taking expected plot lines and turning them on their ear. It uses a good combination of sight gags, and situation comedy to very good effect.In short, both Channing Tatus (Jenko) and Jonah Hill (Schmidt) are just bad at certain aspects of their chosen careers in law enforcement. They band together to shore up each others weaknesses and manage to just make things worse by dragging each other further down.Great supporting roles by Dave Franco (brother of James Franco),and Brie Larson do an admirable job representing 'todays youth' while keeping things light. Also a surprise cameo from Depp.This is a good film for the older set as it turns your expectations of high school upside down, and just generally pokes fun at high school life from today and 25 years ago.See it.

They pull off one of the hardest things in film: turning a thing of the past into something that is both exciting and worth your time and money to see.The film manages to both connect with this generation which is into ""green"" initiatives, texting, and feelings, something that previous generations scoffed at and mocked.

Oh wow look another generic comedy,"It seems like screen writers have been following the same set of rules for every comedy they churn out these days:Awkward main character is awkward.// Awkward main character decides to do something to make himself not so awkward (become a pig).// Awkward character makes a close friend Awkward character becomes cool.// Awkward character develops a love interest.// Plot moves on.// Awkward main character and best friend's relationship becomes strained.// This causes repercussions generating an alltime 'low' in the movie, usually things are strained with love interest too.// Somehow magically it isn't the end of the line.// Cue music.// The duo redeem themselves High fives all roundOh and there's some gags throughoutCopy this down people, follow this template and you could oneday be a millionaire.I gave it 4 stars because it genuinely made me laugh at parts, the enrire film is cookie cutter though, though if a comedy makes you laugh it deserves stars.Sorry for making this a pain in the backside to read, it wouldn't linebreak when I wanted it to.-RP",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Way better than the trailer...Which is actually pretty rare.,"This is one of those few movies where the movie is better than the trailer. And the trailer ain't even misleading. Cause when I saw the trailer to this movie I had low expectations for it, but it turned out to actually be a funny comedy. I thought the comedy would be something similar to ""The Other Guys"" which is a movie I really disliked. But I was relieved to find out that the two protagonist are idiot characters but they don't try to act so darn forced to act like idiots to be funny. This movie embraces stereotype in a funny manner sometimes, now the key word here is funny. Without it trying to be overly offensive or malicious while using these stereotypes. The partnership between the two protagonist is a dorky smart guy and a brainless jock that is actually likable. Anyways they didn't really get along or anything like that although the attended the same high school at the same time. But they both end up training at the same police academy and end up being best for buds. And after they both become cops they go undercover back to high school to find the suppliers for a drug that kills teens. But it's engaging and it's just never gets boring or start to run out of steam. Yeah some parts are just too stereotypical, but they don't go super overboard to the point the whole thing is ridiculous. Even the girl that the smart dork falls for isn't the hottest girl in school or anything like that. Cause the hot cheerleader falling for the kid with the heart of gold scenario has been done to death and not all that believable. But in this the guy actually might have a chance. Anyways when it comes to the undercover part which takes up most of the movie I found it intriguing how the popular jock back in the day end up chilling with the nerds and the smart dork hangs with the popular kids. So they both handle areas they never been before. And it's funny how things play-out. But what stood out a lot is how realistic and relatable it is when it comes to the teens in high school and what they do during free-time. This movie is just fun all the way through. When it comes to buddy cop movies, this is good as ""Rush Hour 2"".8.2/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

They took all the stereotypical setups for jokes, and completely turned them around. Very funny flick.Another good scene is when they have the play and Channing and Jonah have that fight.

Much funnier then I was expecting. Hill is great as always and Tatum is actually really funny. I recommend this. I say A,"""You are here because you some Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus lookin' mothers. You will be going in as undercover high school students."" After two new to the force cops Schmidt (Hill) and Jenko (Tatum) mess up an important arrest they are reassigned to an undercover mission dealing with high school drugs. After being sent back to school their job is to fit in with the kids and try to uncover the source of the drugs, without being made. I have to admit that I was looking forward to this because I think Jonah Hill is hilarious in everything. I never saw the TV show and really didn't know what this was going to be like. After the first ten minutes I began laughing so much that my side hurt and by the end of it I was in pain from the laughter, it never stopped. There are some great lines in this but the timing of Hill and Tatum (who really surprised me in this) is great and I really hope they make another one. This is a must see for comedy fans.

"An infectiously fun, downright hilarious comedy.","'21 Jump Street (2012)' is an infectiously fun, downright hilarious comedy reboot of a 1980s TV show and is surprisingly good, ending up a real treat and a truly great time from beginning to end. It never takes itself seriously enough for its slightly silly core conceit to even be close to questionable within its own world and all the people involved clearly put so much passion in that it ends up exuding an energy that will put a smile on your face throughout. It also makes sure to build its characters enough that you really care about them and manages to satirise the genre in an incredibly satisfying way. It's certainly one of the best comedies in recent memory. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Quality film in terms of action, story and especially comedy.","So I just came back from watching ""21 Jump Street"" and was seriously impressed with not only how funny It was, (For the most part) but also how smart it was, in terms of understanding what young people are like today and how they put a spin on certain scenarios.I'm assuming you already know the story as this review will most likely not be the first you read, so I will just skip to what I thought. Let me get one thing clear, skinny Jonah Hill is just as funny as fat Jonah Hill. Weight is not relevant to comedy unless it relies mostly on slapstick humour, which this film only has touches of. There were so many moments to pick from where I laughed, but by far the funniest scene Is Channing Tatum and Hill on drugs.I was Impressed with how surprisingly good everyone acted in this, as generally a film packed with comedy has less focus on good acting. Obviously it's far from Oscar worthy, but I felt myself getting really involved In the film, unlike a comedy such as step brothers, which I saw more as a scenario for making joke after joke.There are only a couple of minor things I have to say about this. The first being that the comedy falls a bit flatter during the final act. Don't get me wrong, I still laughed in places, but the pumping out of good jokes was much more consistent in the first half of the film. Nevertheless, still a hilarious film. The second thing was a few predictable clichés that I saw coming, but I can let that slide because most films these days have them.Overall the best comedy I've seen so far this year. I certainly recommend it to anyone who Is a fan of the original ""21 Jump Street"", a fan of Jonah Hill and just generally a fan of good comedies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
This halfway funny version of the old TV show 21 Jump Street is pretty enjoyable for what it is,"Having just seen lots of other movies either me or my movie theatre-working friend had wanted to watch over the last several weeks, it's only today that we finally decided to look at this one after all that time. For the most part, I found it all quite hilarious during the first hour before seeming to lose some steam during the last 20 or so minutes. Still, Johah Hill and Channing Tatum never lose their energy during that whole time. And there's some occasional good turns by Rob Riggle, Nick Offerman, Chris Parnell, Ellie Kemper, and Brie Larson to also provide some enjoyment. So on that note, this satiric movie version of the TV series 21 Jump Street is worth a look. Oh, and you can expect some choice cameos when watching something like this.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
8/10,"It's something about Jonah Hill comedies! I'd call 21 Jump Street one of the rare movies that intend to be funny, and successfully hitting the mark in almost every department, with its humour lying in its perfect balance between absurdity and cleverness. The first thing that stands out is how genuinely hilarious it is. Not a typical try-hard comedy film, prime Kanye West tweets type of funny. From the outset, the film doesn't shy away from embracing its ridiculousness, whether it's the snappy dialogue, the outlandish situations, or the self-aware moments poking fun at typical high school tropes.The acting, over the top, yes, but in the best way possible. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum might be an unlikely pairing, but their dynamic is flawless. They play the characters to perfection. Their performances bring them to life in a way that makes their ridiculous journey believable. The way they commit to the absurdity of their roles only amplifies the humour, it's almost as if they're in on the joke with the audience.And let's not forget the plot. For a film that could've easily leaned into simple jokes or predictable moments, it actually crafts in a plot that's surprisingly interesting. The whole premise, two cops going undercover in a high school, is intriguing enough on its own, but it's the way the film plays with expectations, delivering a mix of mystery, action, and laughs that elevates the story. It's a well-constructed narrative that doesn't get bogged down by the comedy; it keeps the audience engaged while still delivering those moments of liveliness.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Has that 80's coming of age movies' charm,"What drives the movie primarily is the screen chemistry between its two lead actors but that's not to say it lacks depth otherwise. It works well as a coming of age movie where our arrested development case protagonists go back to high school, one with hopes of reliving, the other with goals of avoiding their respective experiences a few years back. There is a resurgence of coming of age movies in recent years, perhaps people like to reminisce through others what it meant once to have their whole life ahead of them, without the accumulated cynicism of old age to weigh them down, perhaps they would like to forget momentarily that their best years are behind them. Certainly, 21 Jump Street also has this naive quality, could be willful ignorance to some extent, but as rare as it is, it's nice to pretend a world like that exists where even the bad guys aren't so bad as they shoot and murder undercover police officers in cold blood.21 Jump Street captures the essence of that youthful innocence, that high-school camaraderie between best friends and sprinkles some dust of platonic romance on top of it for good measure. The end result is a surprisingly witty, endearing and funny movie which creates a good balance between being self-aware yet sticking to the conventions where it matters. It's a really good watch as a result.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Meh..,"Go watch ""The Other Guys"" is you want a good funny cop movie.21 Jump Street is just average.

One of the funniest adult comedies of all time! Even raunchier and funnier than The Hangover  series.,"The movie begins with it's two main characters Schimdt(Jonah Hill) & Jenko(Channing Tatum) screwing up badly in high school due to which neither of them can attend the ever so looked forward to high school prom. Fast forward 5 or 10 years & the both of them are undergoing rigorous training and tests to become cops. During this time Schimdt & Jenko become the best of friends unlike their time in high school where they were complete opposites. Jenko was the cool guy & Schimdt was the bumbling geek. However, once they become cops they fail miserably at their jobs even forgetting to read an important law after arresting a criminal. So, the head police officer Captain Dickson(Ice Cube), gives them an undercover investigation where the 30+ friends pose as teenagers & return to high school to stop the manufacture & making of an extremely dangerous synthetic drug. This is a nightmare for Schimdt but a pleasant surprise for Jenko. From here on the hilarity ensues(though it was funny even till now).Schimdt & Jenko have absolutely no idea as to what they're doing. High school was way different when they were young than now. Now the geeks are popular & the so called 'cool' people are unpopular. A mix up between the IDs made for each of them specially for their second round of high school, gets Schimdt doing all the cool stuff like drama classes, races & other so called cool stuff. Jenko, on the other hand has to do the geeky stuff like chemistry club, band practice etc. This mix up between the roles they were supposed to play & the roles they play eventually is one of the major points that makes this movie Laughing My Ass Off(LMAO) material! Schimdt finally gets to be cool & Jenko finally gets to be smart. The chemistry shared between Jonah Hill & Channing Tatum is simply mind blowing! These two, with all their fat guy, tough guy, good cop, bad cop, histrionics light up the film leaving the viewer in splits. Awesome job guys! The supporting characters like Eric(Dave Franco), Molly(Brie Larson) & Mr.Walters(Rob Riggle) are hilarious as well. A special mention should be for Ice Cube whose done a spectacular job in his too funny to be true portrayal of Captain Dickson. So, I would like to wrap up by saying 21 Jump Street is a must watch especially if you love the adult comedy genre. Even if you don't, I'm sure it will definitely surpass your expectations.

The first one that comes to mind is the amazing chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum. Channing Tatum was especially surprising since I have never known him to do anything that was even slightly comical. Tatum's jock character meshes perfectly with the geeky Jonah Hill. Together the two successfully carry the movie with each character providing a number of hysterical moments.

"Nothing's Sacred, Not Even Itself, in This Shockingly Funny Resurrection","Although this looked, by all indications, to be just another empty cash-in on a familiar franchise from thirty years ago, in reality it's a completely self-aware semi-satire that's funnier than it has any right to be. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum take their roles about as seriously as the film does itself (read: not at all) but still manage to develop a weird sort of chemistry as a helplessly stupid, modernized odd couple. It's to be expected that they'll stumble and bumble their way to the head of a major criminal organization. But rather than trying in vain to avoid the clichés inherent with such a familiar premise, Jump Street completely embraces them and actually dictates its decision to do so. Maybe the best example of this is in Nick Offerman's all-too-brief cameo, as he stares down the lens and deadpans a monologue about recycling thin gimmicks from the past. For storyline purposes, he's talking about the department resuscitating the Jump Street undercover program, but it doesn't take a grin or a wink to know what he's really on about. He grins and winks anyway. As a parody of everything from its genre to its audience, this is pointedly effective stuff. It struggles to develop into anything more serious, but that's not really the point.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

So much better than I expected,"To be fair I didn't expect to enjoy this movie as much as I did. 21 Jump Street is hilarious. Of course many of the jokes are typical and disgusting and annoying, but a lot of times the jokes and the absurdity of the situation just becomes absolutely hilarious. A good example is when they have to take the drug in front of the guy selling them, and then the rest of their day goes so wrong in ridiculous way.Probably the best joke is when Deputy Chief Hardy says ""We're reviving a canceled undercover police program from the '80s and revamping it for modern times. You see the guys in charge of this stuff lack creativity and are completely out of ideas, so all they do now is recycle stuff from the past and expect us all not to notice."" Great irony!I haven't actually seen the original show, but from what I know there's no point in comparing them like which one is better, since the stories are different and all that.

Top Viewing,"If you're looking for a funny film to watch any time soon, then go and buy this DVD. 21 Jump Street is a typical film of this new comedy generation. With its witty humour, and serious storyline, this film really catches the attention of the audience, and has you hooked to the very end. The film has a continuous high quality action/comical theme to it throughout, mainly due to the high budget that has been cleverly distributed on the scenes of action e.g. the explosions and high tech filming equipment used to film the car chases etc. Along with this, another key feature to the likability and high quality of the film is the calibre of the cast with stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum playing the main characters 'Schmidt' and 'Jenko' who take a trip back to their high school youth in order to prove themselves as cops and take down the bad guys. Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum both give extremely professional performances, portraying the characters well, and with two such highly rated actors playing the main characters, it complements and does the storyline and the writers directors and producers justice.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

A surprisingly competent comedy,"This really has no right to be any good. It's a wacky buddy cop movie loosely based off a 1980's American TV show that helped propel Johnny Depp into world-wide recognition. This really should have crashed and burned like all the other ""tongue in cheek"" takes on a really tired formula. But somehow they make it work, mostly through a pretty hilarious screenplay by Michael Bacall and through pretty solid performances by the two leads, Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum.To sum up the movies plot briefly for those who haven't seen the show and who can't read plot synopsis on wikipedia, Schmidt (Hill)was the socially illiterate high school nerd who is of course incapable of getting a date for the prom and Jenko (Tatum)was the dumb but handsome jock who can't pass such and such class to go to the prom or whatever. Fast forward 8 years and they're both in police academy where Schmidt cannot run and Jenko cannot learn. They realise that they can cover the other's deficiencies and naturally bond, becoming good friends. However after a drug bust at the park goes south they're transferred to an undercover unit designed to disguise officers as high school students where they can infiltrate the local gang or, in this case, investigate the new drug on the market. So Schmidt and Jenko have to go back to school again! (cue the wacky hijinks)If that plot sounds stereotypical it's because it is and the film's script revels in it's stupid premise. Numerous references are made to the fact the actors look to be in their late 20s/early 30s which is something that is immediately apparent in way to many high school movies. Their police captain is played by Ice Cube as a very funny take on the angry black superior trope that infested shows in the 80s. Later in the movie there's a heated car chase and genuine surprise when several easily flammable objects don't explode. However I would say it goes to far in terms of parody and homage in lieu of creating original content, something that the movie even acknowledges when describing the 21 Jump Street program.Of the two leads they both give good performances, in particular Channing Tatum who has surprisingly good comedic timing. He should stop doing all those god-awful romantic movies and take up more comedic roles. I also like how the focus is on their friendship not their rivalry, I'm sure the temptation to make this movie the nerd vs the jock must have been overwhelming for the writer. Thankfully it was not to be. The rest of the cast plays their role adequately with no standout performances with a brilliant cameo at the end that I simply couldn't spoil.So this is a funnier and deeper movie than it has any right to be. High School was a tough time for many of us and I sure know I'd like to redo it with all the ""wisdom"" and ""experience"" I've gained over the years. Though maybe I'd find I'm just a different kind of idiot now.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

As witty as anyone could have hoped for from the Johnny Depp career launcher!,"'21 JUMP STREET': Four Stars (Out of Five)Jonah Hill co-wrote and co-stars in this Buddy Cop film reboot of the popular 80's TV series. Channing Tatum also co-stars and Michael Bacall (who also co-wrote 'SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD' and 'PROJECT X') co-wrote the screenplay. Phil Lord and Chris Miller (who also directed 'CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF MEATBALLS') directed the film. The combination of Hill and Tatum is gold as far as buddy films go and the script is about as witty as anyone could have hoped for from the Johnny Depp career launcher!The original Fox Network TV series ran from 1987 to 1991 and starred Johnny Depp, Richard Grieco, Steven Williams, Holly Robinson, Peter and Michael De Luise and others as young undercover police officers busting crime in high schools and other youth hangouts. This film picks up over twenty years later with the operation being reinstated. It focuses on two rookie cops (Hill and Tatum), who knew each other in high school when Tatum's character bullied Hill's, that are now teamed together to stop a synthetic drug gang.Hill and Bacall's script is genius and the directing fits the material but it's Hill and Tatum that really make the movie work. A 'Buddy Film' is only as good as it's buddies and Hill and Tatum work magic together. The film doesn't have a lot to do with the original series but some of it's stars do show up in memorable cameos. As far as action goes the movie isn't really that thrilling either but the jokes are witty and the leading man chemistry is beautiful.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2vhN3UBteY",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill were great together in this buddy comedy and the dialogue in this film was extremely funny although very vulgar (as Jonah Hill always is). 21 Jump Street, directed by the duo that brought us Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs Phil Lord and Chris Miller, is a very entertaining and funny film. It had me laughing from the very beginning. I can't say if it is anything like the series was because this is a buddy comedy and I understand the series was more of a mystery action drama. I guess if you were a fan of the series you might enjoy some of the references and cameos that showed up in the movie, but it isn't important to know anything about it because 21 Jump Street works on its own as a very funny comedy. The script written by Michael Bacall (Scott Pilgrim vs. the Word) and Jonah Hill is very slick and funny. There are plenty of smart and funny dialogues throughout the film. I was entertained from the very beginning all the way to the very end so I absolutely recommend this movie.Schmidt (Jonah Hill) was nothing like Jenko (Channing Tatum) in High School, Schmidt was more of a nerd while Jenko was the popular jock. Despite not being friends in school, they meet at the Police Academy and decide they can help each other out: Schmidt is good with the written test, but lacks the physical strength, while Jenko is in perfect shape but can't pass the exams. The two help each other out and become best friends before graduating as police officers. Life in uniforms isn't as full of action as they expected as they are assigned to guard a local park in their bikes. They are finally given the opportunity to go undercover at a local High School where a dangerous synthetic drug is being dealt with. They are only chosen because both still look young so Schmidt and Jenko find themselves back in school. Captain Dickson (Ice Cube) assigns them with their new identities and Schmidt is sent back to his parent's house along with his new brother Jenko. At school their identities are swapped and Jenko ends up with the nerds studying advanced chemistry while Schmidt has to deal with acting lessons and sports. Somehow Schmidt begins to enjoy life as one of the popular kids in the group, while Jenko discovers what it's like not to be popular anymore. Schmidt befriends Eric (Dave Franco) right away as he discovers he is one of the dealers, and also falls for Molly (Brie Larson) his acting partner.The movie works really well thanks to the great chemistry between Tatum and Hill, and thanks to the smart script. I wasn't really expecting this movie to be as good as it was so I was really surprised with how much I ended up enjoying this film. I left the theater with a big smile on my face. It is one of those movies which you won't have any trouble going to see it again with other friends who haven't seen it. The cameos in this film are also pretty great and I enjoyed each one of them. The movie also makes some funny references about itself so it actually acknowledges some of the ridiculousness of its plot which actually makes it even funnier. There is one scene where they are ripping off how movies from the 80's are being recycled now due to lack of fresh ideas. 21 Jump Street isn't afraid of laughing at itself and its silly premise, which ends up making the film even better. This is one of the surprise comedies of 2012, and I hope plenty of more come out this year.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"1st time I watched it I hated it, 2nd time round I loved it!","I watched this not long after its release and I found it incredibly tedious and didn't enjoy it at all. Now, after the release and hype of 22 Jump Street I felt like I was missing out so I re-watched 21 Jump Street at the weekend and loved it! It is a very, very funny!Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum's on screen chemistry is fantastic. The film starts with them at school and from the start it highlights how completely opposite they are. They have many opposing personalities and attributes but they fit together perfectly. Jonah is the clever, sensible unpopular kid at school and Tatum is the cool, sporty popular kid at school. The film zooms forward 7 years to them both graduating Police Academy and from then, their chemistry really comes to life. Not long after they are sent back to School undercover as students. The whole cast is fantastic, Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum & Ice Cube are the stand outs for me. Ice Cube plays the role that he plays best: the angry, no nonsense & outspoken boss. It is certainly refreshing to see Tatum move away from his rom-com style films he is usually associated with and put in an equally impressive performance. Jonah however plays his usual role with crude jokes and unprovoked use of bad language; this isn't necessarily a bad thing though as it compliments Tatum's character very well.The best thing about this movie is that it doesn't take itself seriously. It makes many references throughout which mimic action movies and their clichés. The car bonnet slides, the delayed explosions and the use of firearms are a few examples of this. It is a great mix of subtle one liners and slap stick action comedy scenes.I would certainly recommend this film and I am still struggling to remember why I dismissed this movie as awful upon first watch a couple of years ago!8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"""21 Jump Street""- the Worlds Funniest Movie","""21 Jump Street"" is a comedy that is hilarious and entertaining. One reason why is because the actors have had extensive experience in acting. Another reason why is because the comedy portion is jocular and clever. The last reason why ""21 Jump Street"" is an amazing movie is because the plot can actually relate to a teens life.Evidently, the actors and actresses in this movie have had copious experience in the movie and acting industry. For example, the main characters played by Channing Tatum, Jonah Hill, and Brie Larson have all had an abundant amount of history in acting. Channing Tatum first started out as a model. His good looks and charming personality soon got him into the acting world. As of today, Tatum has stared in 32 movies. Furthermore, Tatum has been in extremely successful movies such as ""Magic Mike"" and ""The Vow."" Jonah Hill is a famous actor known for being in amusing movies. Jonah has a quirky personality, but at the same time he is sweet. Hill even has a tattoo on his arm dedicated to his grandma! Brie Larson has also had a lot of experience in the acting world. Not only has she stared in several movies, but she also has a singing career. Larson is also a beautiful actress. All the other actors all have had entertaining parts in this movie, which makes the movie amazing.In addition to having incredible actors, ""21 Jump Street"" is a great comedy. Not only is the comedy hilarious, but it is also clever. This movie is definitely made for an audience with a vast amount of love for comedies. Although the jokes can sometimes be inappropriate, they are still hysterical. Directors, Phill Lord and Chris Miller did a great job adding funny jokes. The script was amazing with priceless moments. Watching this movie with friends is definitely the way to go. It is assured you will finish the movie by peeing your pants.On the other hand, this movie is inappropriate and has cussing. It should be required to be thirteen years old; or maybe even older to watch ""21 Jump Street."" I also suggest to watch this movie without parents. Things could quickly become awkward if watched with an adult. Additionally, I suggest having a good sense of humor if you consider watching this movie. However, ""21 Jump Street"" is a prodigiously fantastic film.Ultimately, the plot of this movie can relate to many teen's life. Essentially, this movie is about two police men going back to high school to find synthetic drugs the students are using. Throughout the movie, the two policemen realize what it's like being in high school again. Dealing with drugs, friendship, and love are all main parts of the movie. Countless teens deal with all these things, so it is a great movie to watch if you are going through high school. Just like Captain Dickson says in the movie, ""They teenagers, man. They really stupid."" Parts like this are great for laughs and good times. Movies where teens can basically laugh at themselves are the best.In conclusion, ""21 Jump Street"" is an enjoyable movie with excellent actors, clever humor, and a relatable plot. In the future maybe there will be a sequel for all we know. Personally, I would love to see a sequel to ""21 Jump Street."" Hopefully, more people consider watching this movie because I can assure you this: you will not regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Somewhat of a spoof,"Somewhat of a half-hearted fan of the original TV series, ""21 Jump Street"" was a mildly entertaining pop-cultural entry to the 2012 film season. Changing in both character and tone the feature is a comedic outtake from the series, borrowing the basic ideas, but essentially formed around a goofy buddy cop flick. When two cop rejects Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum) make a mess of an arrest by forgetting the wording of the Miranda rights. As a last chance the duo are reassigned to a revived speciality division on 21 Jump Street, which sends undercover units to infiltrate high schools. When the first mission sends both back to their high school, they aim to seamlessly integrate by recapturing their former school standings: Jenko as the popular jock type and Schmidt as the school geek. A screw-up in school papers has their roles reversed...Mostly a spoof with little sensibility ""21 Jump Street"" is rarely fun, mostly feeling like a semi-redundant Van Wilder rethink. Nothing of the original franchise is truly kept, apart from a brief and ultimately unfunny cameo by DEA Agents Tom Hanson (Johnny Depp) and Doug Penhall (Peter DeLuise). Due to this any attempt to compare it to its series namesake is pretty pointless, instead leaving the necessity to vote on the movie on its own merits. As such the plot feels extremely lacking invention with slap-sticky mistaken identity comedy supplanting procedural drama. Mildly funny, mostly juvenile, as a comedy the concept fails to redeem itself in the slightest, thus making it a forgettable viewing comparable to a multitude of teenage-aimed comedies littering the market. Albeit the attempt at self-mockery wasn't necessarily a bad idea, the overall effort was not inventive enough, and although several jokes do catch you unalert with their subversiveness, it fails to reach any heights of note.For me the main issue has to do with the main gripe with many modern comedy movies. They seem to gimmicky and ultimately contrived to bring about real laughs, as if trying to hard to hit home with a laugh (jokes almost punctuated as if to highlight where you are supposed to laugh). People like Seth Rogen or Diablo Cody manage to somehow avoid these pitfalls, but writer-actor Jonah Hill hits them head on.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Raunchy romp,"This film has a very raunchy, crude, American style humour but I still loved it. The leading actors do a good job of delivering the comedy which always has good timing and context. It is quite rare for a comedy film to give me any reaction so I was delighted that this one gave me some chuckles.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Best Cop Movie Since Live Free or Die Hard,"Now Channing Tatum could stand next to Johnny Depp and say ""21 Jump Street made me a star."" The TV show was really good and had very good acting. If it was still running then it could win awards very easily. Most of the time when unknowns are a part of the cast of a film adaptation of a great TV series it turns into a disappointment. For example, the only redeeming value of the Lost in Space movie were the action sequences. But still, they couldn't overcome a lack luster story. However, 21 Jump Street is different. It is actually a great movie and made me a fan of the TV show too. Holly Robinson's cameo reprising her role as Hobbs is okay, but she only appears once and that is for just a few seconds. The best cameo goes to Depp and Peter DeLuise as Hanson and Penhall. 21 Jump Street could be the only movie that prevents Ted from winning the Golden Globe for Best Comedy or Musical.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

It improves nothing but the special effects--which held up very well over time--and in some cases belittles the fans of the original...particularly in the fact that they remade the movie at all, without adding anything clever to it.Like so many other remakes it is a hallow shell of the original.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Juvenile, but very funny","Not as great as Super Bad, but in the ballpark, this movie has an extra layer of intelligence, giving us plenty of meta jokes that, even if probably obvious, are still pretty smart.Also, the directors excell in the timing of the jokes, capturing the comedy of the really good Hill and Tatum, but without relying in just ad lib, like some of the worse comedies tend to do sometimes, but building the jokes and delivering them with precision.Really fun gross and dumb humor that works way better than the majority of the comedies that try it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Review 21 jump street,"21 Jump Street,"" directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, is a comedic reboot of the late '80s television series that originally starred Johnny Depp. Released in 2012, the film stars Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum as Schmidt and Jenko, two police officers who go undercover as high school students to investigate a new drug infiltrating their local school. The film cleverly blends action, comedy, and buddy-cop dynamics while subverting typical genre expectations. The story begins with a brief flashback to Schmidt and Jenko's high school days, where they are portrayed as opposites: Schmidt is the awkward nerd while Jenko is the popular jock. Fast forward eight years, both find themselves at the police academy where they form an unlikely friendship based on their shared misfit status. After a series of comedic mishaps as rookie cops, they are assigned to an undercover unit tasked with infiltrating a local high school to uncover the source of a dangerous new drug. The film's premise hinges on the absurdity of two grown men posing as teenagers. This is acknowledged within the narrative itself, adding a layer of self-awareness that enhances its comedic value. The duo's assignment leads them into various humorous situations, including mistaken identities in classes and social events that highlight their age difference compared to actual high school students. One of the film's strengths lies in its character development. Schmidt (Jonah Hill) is portrayed as socially awkward yet intelligent, while Jenko (Channing Tatum) embodies physical prowess but lacks academic skills. Their contrasting personalities create a dynamic reminiscent of ""The Odd Couple,"" allowing for both comedic tension and heartfelt moments as they navigate their roles in high school.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
By miles the best comedy of the year,"From start to finish, I had a massive grin whilst watching this film. I have to say, I can't have been more impressed. Never for a second was I bored, and I burst out laughing at every joke, and I have to say, there's not many films I can say that about.Sure, for more mature audiences the dick jokes and sight of teens partying might put them off the fun, but teens themselves will be impossibly thrilled. It's cleverly written and brilliantly stylised, and never lets up, not for a second.Tatum and Hill work brilliantly together, and Johnny Depp's cameo (which I was not expecting and was pleasantly surprised by) was a real treat. And even the comedic car chases and shoot-outs had me on the edge of my seat, as well as laughing my ass off.Another good point is the soundtrack: it's exciting and has a kind of retro 1980's feel, though it isn't too retro for modern audiences.Overall, 21 Jump Street is perfect for teen or fun-loving audiences, but people looking for something serious won't be so thrilled. I enjoyed it so much.Overall: 9.6/10See it if you liked: Kick-Ass (2010), Hot Fuzz (2007), Superbad (2007), Scott Pilgrim vs the World (2010)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Ehh... Just OK,"I just don't think this movie was nearly as funny as people let on. I mean it wasn't awful, but it definitely wasn't great. Yes it had it's funny parts, but they were far and few in- between!! They overloaded on cuss words and sex to try to make us laugh, and trust me there was nothing funny about it!! I also don't think all the jokes about drugs were all that funny. I mean a comedy is supposed to make u laugh, and I'm sorry but I just wasn't laughing a lot in this movie. I just don't get all the fuss over this movie. I liked Channing Tatum in it, but I HATE ice cube and Jonah Hill!!! Those 2 just weren't funny at all! I just think this film was very weak as far as comedy goes. Too much sex and profanity and not enough actual comedy and funniness.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Retro Remake Delivers Laughs Galore,"I was there. I remember the moment when this project got announced and I felt the familiar tearing of a piece of my childhood ripped violently from my past and stomped on the ground in front of me. We've been trained by a culture of recycled and rehashed content, making what was once hilarious into something kitschy and embarrassing, turning us into shell-shocked survivors of our own cherished memories. So to say the bar was set low for this would be an understatement of epic proportions, but that's where the creators get their edge, because there is nowhere to go but up. And they did.21 Jump Street follows two former high school enemies who become best friends while training together in the police academy. They find themselves busted down into an undercover program specializing in investigating high schools. Assigned to root out the supply chain of a dangerous new synthetic drug, the two partners try to balance doing their job against the opportunity to re-live high school, for better or for worse.One of the best things about moving something from the TV to the big screen (which may be one of the only things) is it can open up the latitudes of what those characters can say, do and get away with. How many times did you wish one of our 80s sitcom heroes would just drop that bad guy off the roof, saying ""Seriously, that guy deserved it."" 21 Jump Street recognizes that freedom and relishes it from beginning to end without making the classic mistake of overdoing it. They remembered the simple fact that there was a story still needing to be told in order to bring it all together. It's a delicate balancing act; expanding on the original TV concept, catering to the die-hard fans and making it enjoyable for the newcomers. The people at the helm were able to achieve it with apparent ease, but what may surprise some people is just who those people are: Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum.Beyond starring in the film, and reportedly becoming best friends off- screen in the process, Hill and Tatum are listed as Executive Producers on the film. While that title holds many different meanings in Hollywood, from complete controlling interest in a project to just some guy with a checkbook who never even steps on the set, the fact that Hill and Tatum are listed I believe showed a surprising dedication to the project not common to the actors of their generation. Hill is also credited as co-writer of the story, which as I mentioned before, is an integral part of what made this remake a success. The balance between buddy comedy, coming-of-age, action and tempered sex comedy brought so many flavors to the table it was nearly impossible to walk out and say nothing on-screen actually made you laugh.The cast choices were also spot on with current comedic favorites like Rob Riggle, Ellie Kemper and Nick Offerman. This trio shaped and smoothed out the comedic arcs when the main characters had to focus on actually moving the story along. Then comes two of the best cameos of all time: Johnny Depp and Peter DeLuise, original cast members from the TV show. They bridged the gap between history and present day in an incredibly hilarious scene, which can only be seen to be fully appreciated. Not to be left out, fellow original cast members Holly Robinson Peete had a walk on in an early motor pool scene and Dustin Nguyen is actually on a TV in the background later in the film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A really good movie!!!,21 Jump Street is a 2012 American buddy cop action comedy film starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. A really good high school film with plenty of action and will have you laughing out loud. Really good acting from both actors and the storyline is gripping. I enjoyed watching it so if you have not seen it then a must watch. All I can is this is one hell of a film get your popcorn out and enjoy.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
Channing Tatum has found his calling,"Movie adaptation of hit TV shows are always a risky task as filmmakers try and adapt a property with a new cast and updating it to a contemporary age. The adaption and re-make 21 Jump Street decides a different approach, changing the genre from a police drama to a high school/buddy comedy film, with excellent results.In 2005 Schmidt (Jonah Hill) is a nerd and a loser, bullied by the very stupid Jenko (Channing Tatum), a popular jock. However the two become friends at the police training academy, Schmidt helping Jenko with his academic work, whilst Jenko motivates Schimdt with physical training. During their arrest the pair show their incompetents when Jenko does not write the Miranda rights to a suspect and their superior officer transfers them to 21 Jump Street, a special division that sends young officers into high school. Their mission, to infiltrate a drugs ring in a high school and find the supplier of a new manufactured drug before it spreads to other schools. Yet the officers' roles are reversed, with Schmidt the popular kid and Jenko, the loser outsider.What makes 21 Jump Street what is that it is a self-aware comedy and was prepared to embrace clichés of the high school and buddy comedy/action comedy genres so the filmmakers could make fun of them. 21 Jump Street shows that it is willing to make fun of Hollywood and the idea's process, the archetypes of high school and in police films. The popular kids at high school are shown to be a mixed bag, people who care about their futures, not in a particular clique and made to seem a bit more real. Admittedly the nerd characters were a bit too stereotypical but we can't have everything and at least they were not made out to be total losers. There are bites again buddy cop clichés, with Ice-T having great lines and put downs as the angry, black police captain.21 Jump Street is more focused on comedy then action, but there comic action set pieces, one early one in the film, the other being a car chase on the freeway, playing on the idea that a freeways are busy and has fun against the bombast of other action-comedies like Lethal Weapon and Bad Boys.21 Jump Street was directed by Phil Lord and Chris Miller whose previous film was Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, a family animated film: yet they moved into an adult comedy with ease and there is even a really trippy scene when the characters are high, inject a surreal style to the film.In the past I have critical of Tatum in the past, having seen him in films like G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra and Haywire but with 21 Jump Street he found his strongest suit, comedy. He had great comic timing and relations with Hill. Jenko grows as a character throughout the film, becoming more likable, understanding, smarter, loyal and intelligent. With the right direction he can become a great action star.Whilst 21 Jump Street is a really entertaining film there are some criticisms. The first is Dave Franco: I know him best for role in the last series of Scrubs where he was very annoying . He just felt like a pretentious little man and was just well, a non-present in the film. The other is the relationship between Schmidt and Molly (Brie Larson) where it just felt a little out of place. Larson was fine in the film, it basically felt like fantasy reliving for Hill. The filmmakers should have focused more on the flirting and infatuation of the chemistry teacher (Ellie Kemper) who fancied Jenko and knowing it is wrong. It was played up in the trailers.21 Jump Street is an enjoyable comedy, a refreshing take on both the buddy genre and high school genre and entertaining film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
A very fun movie.,"This movie was hilarious! I do not want to come out sounding too carried away, but, it was a really good movie. I do not remember laughing this much in a theater for a long time. I would not recommend it to everyone as everyone has different tastes, but, if you like a movie with good comedy and action you will definitely enjoy it. It should be noted though, that this movie has some mature subject matter, so I would not recommend it to kids and younger audiences.If you already know the plot, just skip to the next paragraph. This movie is basically about two cops who, in high school, did not get along at all. Schmidt (played by Jonah Hill) was a nerd, and Jenko (played by Channing Tatum) was a jock. Due to this Jenko would think that it was funny to make fun of Schmidt a lot. 7 years later they find themselves applying to the same place to be cops. Jenko finds it difficult to pass the written tests during their training, and Schmidt finds it difficult to do the physical tests for the training. So they decide to be friends an help each other out. Then they both pass training and become official cops. After they try and fail to bust someone for drugs (to get assigned to something more exciting than park-duty watch), they are assigned to go undercover in a high school, since they are both young-looking, to find the supplier of a new drug, and it is after this that most of the events in the movie unravel.Both Tatum and Hill did an excellent job playing partners and the undercover cops at the high school. The jokes and other funny moments came out very naturally and not forced at all thanks to them. The same can be said about the action sequences, though people should not expect it to be straight-forward action, this movie is more about the comedy. Also the plot was very nicely carried out throughout the movie within the comedy context.In short, if you want to have a really good time with your friends, keep a fairly open mind and go watch this movie. You will not regret it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

Channing Tatum was a good a comedy guy and this is the first comedy I have seen him in. Not was the movie really funny, the story was good and made sense. There was action too. All I'm going to tell is that Jonah and Channing are young cops that screw up and become part of a special group of young cops who go undercover in high school for drug busts and things of that nature. Ice cube is the leader of this group and is very funny and is a good supporting role. This movie is funny and I don't know why some people do not and will not like this movie.

"Strange, but funny","Before this movie, I wasn't a fan of Jonah Hill, and especially not Channing Tatum. When I heard this movie was being released, I thought they got Tatum, to attract the female crowd, and Hill to attract the average guy. After watching this, I found this was not the case. This was the first time in a while where this new age comedy struck me as humorous. The thing that appealed to me most, was how it ""made fun of"" My generation. ""the teen crowed"". Going back to school, seeing the stereotypical new age kids, was funny for me. The acting on both parts were above average, and both actors complimented each others role. I don't want to say this was an original storyline, but I couldn't tell that it was a branch off of another film like an Adam sandler movie is nowadays.

Amazingfilicous,"""21 Jump Street"" is an excellent film. It contains everything a comedy film needs. It has great actors, great setting, and it was hilarious. This was one of my favorite films ever.Furthermore, ""21 Jump Street"" had great actors. Jonah Hill was the perfect role for Schmidt. He was the nerd in high school and was hilarious. I loved his acting. Channing Tatum also did a great job in this film. He played the role of Jenko. He was the ""jock"" in high school. He was a very funny cop. Overall he did a great job. Ice Cube did an okay job in this film. He played the role of Captain Dickson. The way he ""acts"" doesn't wow me. He acts like he does not want to be there. Maybe that's the way he is supposed to act but I do not like the way he acts. Overall, the actors were amazing.In addition, there was a great setting in this movie. Having them go back to high school was a great idea and I give props to Phil Lord and Chris Miller for directing this film so well. The way that they fit in so well at high school was amazing. Jonah and Channing were hilarious when they were cops, great job Phil and Chris. Overall, ""21 Jump Street"" had a great Setting.Although this movie was awesome, this movie had some scenes that weren't very good. One of these is when they are having a party and the parents walk in. This ruins it. They should have had the parents come home when everyone was leaving. It would have set the mood a lot better and it could have made it a hilarious scene. Another scene I didn't like very much is when the guys weaner gets shot off. That was just gross. The actors should have just left him there to die. They didn't have to shoot his balls. I think that was a little uncalled for. This was still an awesome movie, but if they are going to make another one they should take these things into account.In addition, this movie was hilarious. This was hands down the funniest film I have watched in a long time. Channing played an amazing cop. He chased down the motorcycle gang and when he caught them. He was so proud that he forgot the Miranda rights. This was the funniest scene in the film. Another scene that is hilarious in this movie is when they are getting the drugs for the party they are throwing. This was the funniest movie ever.Additionally, if you haven't seen ""21 Jump Street"" you haven't lived. Go to a local RedBox or something and get it. It is worth watching. Have you ever wondered what it would be like to go to high school? Watch this movie and you will know what going back to high school feels like. Please make another film.

The story line was puerile, one that I have seen many times, but with some innovation. It was billed as a comedy, but I have had more laughs in an operating theater. The language was terrible and totally gratuitous, not adding anything to the plot other than for those imbeciles who think swearing is comedy, which is a cheap shot. There was not one good gag in the whole film. When you watch films like this it does one thing; it explains why the present generation acts the way it does and has the low standards that it displays.

Unfunny movie,"I'll give them an extra star for trying, but this is the worst movie I have seen this summer. Not funny, lots of unnecessary profanity in the name of comedy, sub par acting and a vanilla pudding script and plot. I had expected more from the two main actors but they did not deliver. It was even a waste of the $3 I spent going to the matinée. I know this was to be some sort of comedic parody on the original made for TV drama 21 Jump Street. However, even in that fashion it is a complete flop. C Tatum is a decent actor and seems really out of place in this movie. His sidekick however does belong in this movie. His sidekick(partner) being unattractive, overweight and basically I wonder how he even made it in Hollywood. His folks must be rich and bribed a Producer along the way so he could make it to this film. Whatever the reason, he is certainly not a comedian. To be honest, C Tatum is not a good comedian either and that is just one more reason this movie part is out of place for him, and consequently his performance is lackluster.

Disappointed - Making light of the drug in schools problem.,"The original show provided an insight in what happens in schools, on what must people are not aware. I am going to assume that now days they probably still use undercover officers in some high drug traffic schools, but back then these units did exist and we even had the drug detection K9s show up randomly to check out lockers and my school was in a nice neighborhood so this means it was across the board that they were trying to fight the trafficking. School is not all sports and academics, there are drug dealers and users, sometimes they are students and even teachers. This movie makes light of the drug problem in schools, it should of been used as an opportunity to touch on this subject and show kids what really happens and parents to be more aware not to make fun of it.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

You Better Be Ready To Jump,"This is definitely not the 21 Jump Street that I remember from the 80s. The program that launched Johnny Depp as a star had its funny moments, usually supplied by Peter DeLuise, but the episodes tackled some very serious topics and many of them were outstanding drama without a laugh in them.Such is not the case here where you've got a couple of misfit cops who might have graduated from the Police Academy that George Gaynes was the commandant of. The old Jump Street program that was in an abandoned chapel is being revived for the new millenia and Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum have been selected for the program because of their youthful demeanor.Their rather impatient captain, Ice Cube sends them into a high school to bust a drug ring after the death of one of the students. These two manage to mismatch their covers, but incredibly enough it seems to work out for them.Tatum and Hill have some history between them. Tatum was a popular jock and an academic dud who barely graduated. Hill was a nerdy kid who couldn't get anyone of the opposite sex to look at him. For him this is a big do over, but he barely keeps his mind on the assignment.By the advertising I knew I was not going to get the old familiar 21 Jump Street other than cameo appearances by some of the series regulars back in the day. But I've seen it all before and done better even in the Police Academy movies which never pretended to be comedy of the lowest common denominator.The film has some comic moments, but will disappoint people who think they're going to see a big screen version of what was a big hit in the late 80s.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
"Cops, action, humour & a hint of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.  What's not to like?","I never watched the 80s TV series starring Johnny Depp. I was too busy being severely narked about it. In '85 I had the idea for a great TV show about a kid at school who was really a cop. My friends laughed and said it was stupid, unrealistic and, besides, who'd listen to an idea from a skinny little kid in the backwaters of somewhere distinctly not Hollywood? Then, a couple of years later, two blokes in Hollywood created 21 Jump Street.Not one to hold a grudge, I caught a repeat screening of the updated, upgraded, upsized movie version of 21 Jump Street, staring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum, with limited expectations other than some disposable fun and a rather large serving of cheese. It was worth the effort.Directed by the double act of Phil Lord and Chris Miller, whose last offering was Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, and written by Scott Pilgrim vs the World scribe, Michael Bacall, 21 Jump Street delivers with a cheek full of tongue and embraces its source rather than attempting to obliterate the memory of it, as so many big screen adaptations do.Indeed, they make pretty damn sure we know exactly what's going on with an early line from Ice Cube's Captain Dickson as he unloads the fate of our heroes: ""You see, the guys in charge of this stuff lack creativity and are completely out of ideas. So all they do is recycle sh*t from the past and expect us all not to notice."" And when the hapless duo enquires where they should report, Dickson barks ""37 Jump Street. No, that doesn't sound right"" Superb! But don't think for a minute that implies 21 Jump Street isn't fresh, inventive and thoroughly enjoyable. Sit back, go with it and allow a couple of hours to pass with plenty of smiles and a sufficient quantity of eye candy.The principals play variations of their usual, recognizable characters and there'll be no plaudits for acting prowess but that's not why you come to 21 Jump Street, is it? If you visit this film, and it's well worth it if you have a spare Friday evening with a pizza and a beer, you're coming for easy fun that won't stretch the brain or give you nightmares.It's a simple 'buddy flick' about two failing cops who are given an opportunity to redeem themselves and answer the age-old question: What would I do if I could go back but know everything I know now? So, if you like cops, action, humour, s*x, drugs and rock 'n' roll (well, a hint of it) give it a shot.

Reboot of a Classic(?) TV Series,"A buddy cop comedy disguised as a remake of a classic television series. This is one of the reboots/remakes that doesn't try to recreate the original. Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill are not playing classic characters in a more modern setting. However, this film does act as if it's a continuation of the series as not only does it refer to ""Jump Street"" as a long-running police operation, but there is a hilarious UNCREDITED cameo at the end with series originals who refer to being ex-Jump Street officers. The fact that the original series was dramatic and this is far from it doesn't seem to matter. Nothing really new or creative in story, all the usual buddy film happenings and teen movie shenanigans are here as well as the ""odd couple""-esque partnership. Some of the best parts are where they poke fun at themselves, like Nick Offerman's character using the Jump Street program as a metaphor for Hollywood: ""You see the guys in charge of this stuff lack creativity and are completely out of ideas. So all they do now is recycle s*** from the past and expect us all not to notice."" Worth a look for a laugh or two. 6.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"

"If you struggle with the premise, it won't redeem itself","Maybe nobody but the other virtue police, miscellaneous hoodlums, hippies and concerned mothers of the world will care about this, but:I heard endless good things about this movie but never watched it for a long time because 1) narcs and snitches are not redeemable characters, generally speaking, 2) making a joke of police brutality in this era is in pretty poor taste 3) it's okay to narc out and kill psychedelics dealers who haven't been shown to do anything else illegal. But then again, I think you can make an excellent joke of most things, if you do it right. The trouble is, comedy can be propagandist, it wins people over. So when live animals get blown up for laughs, and the audience laughs along, obviously the whooole audience isn't gonna run out and start blowing up chickens, and if even some people in the audience do, who's responsible? The people who blew up the chickens, not the people who made the movie, ultimately. The whole ""guns don't kill"" argument in a nutshell, right? But even still, the fact that chickens are getting blown up for jokes, green energy guy is evil, the only black people in the movie (except Ice Cube) are either played for laughs as getting punched and being pissy about it or getting shot because they're criminals - shot by cops - is unconscionable. Realistic, yes, but...they're being shown as ""bad guys"" and it's clear we aren't supposed to care or think twice about it. There's no due process, tons of suspects are just getting shot on suspicion of dealing what appear to be psychedelics but are treated like effin bath salts - with the excuse that ""one kid died from psychedelics"". In an era when MDMA and psilocybin are increasingly being found to be extremely useful at mitigating symptoms of depression, schizophrenia, addiction and PTSD among other mental health issues, this fearmongering reinforcement of existing Reagan-era hysterics is in pretty poor taste. A kid could die from tide pods, so should tide dealers be shot without due process? Obvious hyperbole, but nevertheless...That all being said, the movie gives a fashionable nod to marijuana and booze as being ""okay drugs"", as opposed to coke (which is the of a rather funny joke). The film is super funny, despite the main characters being generally unkind, dimwitted, selfish and lacking in empathy. I must admit that even the mean humor is at times pretty funny, though it's in poor taste. Some things are just so needlessly cruel and stupid that they are shockingly hilarious.The tertiary and second characters are quite awesome, and the overall view of the world & modern high school culture is weirdly spot on, making it a less stupid comedy than expected. The jokes are on point, the humor cuts to the core of a lot of pretty realistic situations.If it weren't for the total amorality / very right-wing leaning of the story, I'd give it 7 stars. But there's just no getting around the fact that the better the comedy is, the better the (accidental) propaganda for really low standards for all the high schoolers, college kids, and generally impressionable idiots of all ages watching this and knowing that just spoils it for me, unfortunately. Channing Tatum gets 7 stars for hotness, and but that phone tapping nerd gets 8. Meow.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
another stupid-and-funny-at-the-same-time movie,"""21 Jump Street"" is basically a dumb movie, and knows exactly what kind of movie it is. It makes no pretense about being silly.

Back to the Well,"A juvenile buddy-cop action comedy that's a bit more funny than a ""Bad Boys"" installment but with worse action and where the drug-bust plotline runs through ""Never Been Kissed"" (1999), ""21 Jump Street,"" reportedly, is based on some TV show (hence the Johnny Depp cameo). The police work depicted is atrocious, including the duo protagonists sexually humiliating their first arrest, although them not reading him Miranda, never mind other rights, is given as the reason the suspect is released. Later, one of them shoots another suspect's penis off and after the baddie had already dropped his gun. They read the latter one his Miranda, though, so it's all good, I guess. And, if that's not funny for you, there's also some casual misogyny and sexualization of supposed high-school girls, including one of the cops making out with Captain Marvel on the eve of her 18th birthday in some disturbing fantasy from Matthew McConaughey in ""Dazed and Confused"" (1993). Why did this get good reviews from critics? It's the same stupid comedic mix of slapstick and dick jokes, boring car chases, high-school clichés and eventual bromance sap that's polluted numerous movies already.At least, the story neatly reflects the hackneyed nature of itself with the characters literally going back to the well--returning to high school. There's also the actors-playing-actors nature of the undercover mission, including one of them adding yet another actorly layer by performing in drama class and starring as Peter Pan, of all characters, in a high-school play that is within the larger play that is the movie.

Watch it even if you haven't seen or heard about the TV show.,21 Jump Street is a remake or a reimagining of the television show starring Johnny Depp from the 80s. The film is easy enough to appeal to folks new to the material but it lacks the punches of a pure R rated film(this one is PG). Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum play opposite personalities in that Hill is a geek and Tatum is a stud- who are assigned as partners as they go undercover at a high school to find some drug activities that lead to something bigger. There are enough laughs and yes- Depp has a cameo which should excite older fans and the film is basically a satire of the 80s in many ways.

After a power cut happened, though around 40 minutes into the movie, I realized that I probably didn't have to watch it all. The type of humour is somewhat appealing for my taste, but it just falls totally flat at many times and is very forgettable. It just felt as if funny jokes became unfunny. There are some funny moments, but some moments just felt cringeworthy. For an example, there's bullying.Whenever there weren't jokes, it was just boring.Pros:Lots of jokes.Neat concept.Cons:Unnecessarily crude and the jokes fell flat.Just not that good for me.Overall...3 - Not terrible but probably not that good for me.

But I decided to rewatch it again for a review and tbh it's still good but not as good I thought it would be.It had a solid story with some flaws but the pacing is quiet nice and the ending was quiet a twist. The dialogue was decent and the acting was good also. The music composition and sound choices was really good considering the fact that this was a comedy movie. The jokes are actually quiet funny and I really liked them and they werent too annoying or cliche. The characters were fine and actually had a sense of purpose but weren't interesting or deep.Overall an enjoyable movie but it could get dull quickly after rewatching once or twice.,,Anonymous,"Action, Comedy, Crime"
