"Very entertaining and colourful, and does it live up the first? Yes it does","The first Madagascar was a colourful and above average animated movie. I saw its sequel last night for the first time, not sure not to expect, and I was surprised. It actually lives up to the first pretty much (and almost surpasses it), it isn't as zany in terms of humour to its original despite some very clever references, but it has more heart than the first film did. Of course the plot is very predictable and I did notice one or two similarities with the Lion King, and probably slower than pace. But it is well the watch, for a number of reasons. The animation was beautiful and very colourful, even more so than the original. The characters are still great, the penguins were great fun, but Julien was absolutely hilarious here. The voice actors bring a lot of vigour into the film, Jada Pinkett Smith has more to do here, Ben Stiller and Chris Rock provide great comedy and heart and Sacha Baron Cohen is a hoot as Julien. Plus there is a sweet romantic interlude between Melman and Gloria. All in all, a fun sequel that lives up to the first. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"You Got To Move It, Move It!","Rarely have I seen animated family sequel movie that's as good or better than its predecessor but speaking as a movie freak who didn't like the first installment, I gotta say I'm very much entertained by MADAGASCAR: ESCAPE 2 Africa and it way funnier than the original movie. Dreamworks has a habit of doing this what it lacks in its story and overall animation (Pixar still rules in those departments!) it makes up for it in its sense of humor. This is the movie that every age can enjoy and it has only a very, very few silly, lame moments but for the most part, you just got to move it, move it! The whole team is back, it doesn't take long for you to remember what each character is all about, there's no need for re-introduction but there is a bunch of new characters thrown in to the den without having to take us in unnecessary complication of having to understand what they are. The concept is simple and the jokes are funny. Here you see all the characters stranded in Africa and meet a their own kind. It's the freedom they've always wanted but don't really want at the same time. They have trouble fitting in and getting in touch with their heritage, all the while friendship and feelings are being put to the test resulting in an exciting adventure at the end that brings them closer together again. Kids will love it, Parents will be glad about it, and the rest of us will find it to be very amusing.MADAGASCAR: ESCAPE 2 Africa will feel like too short of a movie, but that's also something that I can appreciate because I don't think it has any intention of trying to be all Oscar worthy, it's nothing more than telling a light, enjoyable story with good moral value lesson and that's about it. If the running time were any longer, it would lose some of its target audience. Hands down, without dragging this review any more than it has to, the best part of this movie once again, are the penguins! Those dudes are hardcore gangsters and freakin' hilarious! They should have their own spin-off, stand-alone movie, just about them scheming something deviant and mission impossible-esquire. I could watch them work together and hear their smartass, cocky remarks/attitude about a thousand more times and they'll still crack me up. If you find no reason to watch this movie, then at least watch it to check out those awesome penguins.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Madagascar,"This movie really will give you a good laugh. It is about a new adventure of the four friends: Alex the lion, Melman the giraffe, Marty the zebra, Gloria the hippo. On the trip back to New York, they had an air crash and came to Africa instead. There, they found their roots and also came across some difficulties. In this movie, there are many supporting roles. And among them, the four little penguins played an important part and even covered the other main roles for their genius and humor. From the very beginning, the four penguins spoofed the DreamWorks icon. As for their popularity, the DreamWorks even planned to make a film about the Madagascar Penguins. I'm really looking forward to it. In this movie, the film makers pictured us an amazing Africa with wild animals and beautiful landscapes. The visual effects are pretty good and impressing. And I like the theme song ""Move It"", really making me full of energy and feel the desire of dancing with the characters. The last scene when Marty said that ""Love has no boundary"", I can't agree more. And I think that this does not only apply to love between lovers but also apply to love between friends and family. All in all, this is quite a funny movie and worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Madagascar,"It's hard to say if is an improvement or not on the original, but it's certainly a good continuation of the story this time more focused on Alex's origin and life. The animation looks great, the humor is on point of course, and the characters with so much more development. With some great moments is a fun sequel to all ages!",,Anonymous,Animation
I wanna see a spin off with the penguins!,"I am a fan of the first Madagascar film, I know there are a lot of people who dissed it, but I thought it was cute. So when I saw the trailer for Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, I was excited. I saw it on Friday and I absolutely enjoyed this fun family film. I think this even had a more coherent plot as well, plus how could you not love the penguins? They are absolutely hilarious and need their own movie, maybe a Full Metal Jacket with penguins! Anyways, I loved the characters so much, they're back and better than ever. They even ended up giving the little old lady from the first Madagascar who fought Alex the Lion, she has a bigger role and was so awesome to watch and listen too. I think the jokes were even funnier than the first Madagascar, my favorite scene without a doubt was the plane sequence in the beginning. But the whole story was just a blast to watch.Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman are still looking to go back to Africa, everything seems to be a good and they start to fly back with the penguins as well as Julien. But the plane runs out of fuel and crashes, they are still in Africa, but bump into an animal pack where Alex finds his long lost parents, Marty finds out that all zebras are like him(imagine being surrounded by 1,000 Chris Rocks*shudder*), Gloria has a hunky hippo who is crushing on her, and Melman becomes the giraffe witch doctor of his group. Alex is about to be initiated into his pride, but one lion does not want him part of the group and will do anything to become leader.Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is definitely worth your watch, it's not the animated film of the year, but it was a lot of fun to watch. It kind of reminded me of The Lion King a little bit, it has a similar story. It's a great family film and is fun for both the kids and the adults as well. Although I still think it's funny that Alex is voiced by Ben Stiller and his dad is voiced by Bernie Mac, but it's all good, who knows, maybe Alex's dad just had a little more soul in him. I would recommend this film, it was a lot of fun to watch and I suggest we write in a script for those penguins! They're a blast to watch on screen.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Nutshell Review: Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,"Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith are back in their animated animal roles which 3 years ago saw their zoo animals being transported to Madagascar in a typical fish out of water tale, where they had to rely on their street smarts and friendship to survive in an environment they do not fully understand. While it's the usual pop-culture jokes and witty one liners that plague recent animated films, there were some gems in that movie, the ones which stuck suck as the crowd favourite penguins stealing the whole show, as well as the madcap rave party tune Move It!Beginning directly where we last saw Alex the Lion (Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Rock), Melman the Giraffe (Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Smith), the penguins have finally built a plane that ought to bring our merry crew back to New York, together with Julien the lemur (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his sidekick (Cedric the Entertainer), but of course should that happen, there'll be no sequel to begin with. So we have the crew crash land into the continent Africa, thereby guaranteeing yet another tale of being from the outside, but now having a habitat that's much closer to their natural environment, one which sees the animal types in question grouped together into one reserve for storytelling convenience.Directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, who also provided the voice of Skipper the head penguin, the storyline might seem like a poor man's cousin to Disney's The Lion King, what with exiles and alpha-lions battling it out to be king of the habitat. The filmmakers had taken the opportunity to craft the backstory for Alex a little more, so that the main plot of his return to his home could be dwelled upon, with sub plots for the others to fall into place. You have Alex's return and reunion with his parents, with adversary coming from an earlier generation, there's Marty who discovers that he's no longer unique but the same as every other hundredth zebra out there, Glora looking for love with other hippos now that there's no lack of suitors, and Melman fighting his own cowardice to reveal his feelings for Gloria, as well as being appointed the witch doctor for the land.And if you think that the primary voice cast is already A-list, the film piles on to that list with the likes of the late Bernie Mac voicing Zuba the alpha-lion, Alec Baldwin again in a villainous role as his rival Makunga, and Will.i.am of Black Eyed Peas in a hilarious role of hippo-Casanova Moto Moto (the name's so good you have to say it twice!) The songs department falls up a bit short this time round, though thankfully ""Move It!"" wasn't conveniently and lazily played ad-nauseam. Given the army of illustrators working on the project, you can't expect quality to drop from its predecessor, though there's nothing new to be injected into a mature presentation.Despite the plundering of the same old family values / theme / storyline and the importance of establishing strong friendships, this new Madagascar managed to deliver on multiple fronts, joining the ranks of the few whose sequels are superior than the original. The comedy which got piled up here managed to work through the punchlines, leading to a number of characters like the monkeys and even the tough-cookie granny to steal some limelight from the lovable penguins. If you liked the original, then you'e likely to fall in love with this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than the original,"I thought that the first Madagascar had promising characters and a decent premise, but it was very poorly put together. My son, who was 8 or 9 at the time loved the movie, however. We saw the sequel this morning and we both agreed - it was much better than the original. And, since part II begins with a brief summary of part I, there is no need to see the first one to understand what's happening in the new movie. All the main characters are back and there are many new ones as well. Going in, the big question on my mind was ""do the penguins play a bigger role in the sequel?""... answer is ""Yes, but not much bigger"". All in all an enjoyable movie that outshines it's predecessor!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The animation was better, there is a stronger story, there is more heart....but....","The original Madagascar was a break from the typical mold in family animated entertainment; it was fearless, didn't slow down to teach a lesson, and was not afraid of entertaining solely on physical humor. The content was light, but it was so satisfying that it wound up being Dreamwork's second best animated movie of them allbehind Shrek. The zany cast of characters easily exceeds the number of memorable characters in Shrek, and contained more humor and creativity than all of the other Dreamworks animated flicks before and ever since.In the second installment, you see the writers trying to give the franchise a dosage of heart and sentimentality, which is what made Shrek the instant classic it became. A bit of heart can definitely propel an animated movie into masterpiece status (see Toy Story and Finding Nemo) however this is not the franchise to do it. Madagascar is about the cast and how they interact with each other and the conflict that is presented onto them. While the laughs are definitely here, the attempt for emotion constantly makes this film slows down and keeps it from being a superior installment when placed against the original. That being said, it's still a fun, entertaining, and unpredictable movie that continues the zaniness that made the original a personal guilty pleasure of mine.In Escape 2 Africa, we follow the New York zoo animals, the psychotic penguins, the monkeys, and the lemur leaders as they unexpectedly are stranded in the middle of Africa. While at first the main four (Marty, Alex, Melman, Gloria) are rather happy at their new environment, they quickly realize that it's not all that it seems, and that their new temporary home is splitting the four apart. In the meantime, the penguins attempt to repair the plane that they accidentally destroyed. The writers did a good job in presenting all sorts of new gags and yet again refrain from referencing pop culture too much (although the Twilight Zone nod was hilarious). But, they couldn't deliver the emotional impact because of one main reason: this franchise wasn't meant to ever slow down in terms of pacing. Like a roller coaster, this movie moves sometimes extremely fast, and then can grind into a halt in the next scene. Lastly the main four don't interact much with each other, but more with the environment. There literally are at least 8 plots happening at oncesome of them are good, some of them aren't.The voice acting remains decent, but there are fewer lines by the original cast, and more from supporting characters and new characters. Bernie Mac, rest in peace, but his performance was rather bland and could have been done by anyone else. Alec Baldwin didn't have much of a chance to lend his comedic skills either. Yet again, the penguins and Sacha Baron Cohen steal every scene they are in, no matter how mediocre the previous scene was. Cohen (as Julien) has an obvious knack for comedy, and delivers every line perfectly for two movies in a row; not bad at all. Ben Stiller had fewer chances at being funny, as they had to handle all the major slower moments. Chris Rock's role was surprisingly limited, especially for someone who did so well in the original.The one major improvement from the original was the animation, which was crisp, fluid, and flowed better. Surely it's undeniably no Wall-E (Or even 2007's Ratatouille), but it's still respectably an improvement over previous work. The jokes themselves are hit-and-miss like the original; the only difference is this one has more misses. Plus it's the recurring jokes that are missing; the hula girl, feisty tourist, repetitive herd, and lion-dancing bits all didn't elicit much laughter from the audience, nor from me. We just needed much more Julien, and much more penguin-action. Maybe in the future the focus will shift; in the meantime they are just grabbing all the spotlight and attention.Bottom Line: Exactly what Scrat did to Ice Age: The Meltdown years ago, we have minor/supporting characters becoming the main hit and running the show. While the original four characters take a backseat and add emotion to a franchise that's too fast-paced for this sort of stuff, we have the penguins and Julien taking over the movie and keeping it from being another totally disappointing animated sequel like every straight-to-video Disney sequel, the ugly Shrek sequels, or Ice Age 2. The entertainment level is still magnificent the second time around, but it won't age as well as the first Madagascar did. Leave the heart to Pixar, because those folks have nailed it perfectly for years. Dreamworks can serve as the escapist cinema in terms of animation, but if they continue imitating and try to outdo Pixar, it will just dampen the quality of all their movies. Madagascar 2 is the prime example of this: purely fun and entertaining until it tries to distribute family values. Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is also proof that those hilarious penguins need their own movie, pretty much immediately.Yes, right now.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another Madagascar Winner,"Well, so far ""Madagascar"" is two-for-two in the laughs department. This is just as good, if not better, than the first film.It's another good example of the ""new"" (last 10 years) kind of animated feature film that adults can enjoy just as much as the kids. In some cases, perhaps like this one, adults would laugh even more because many of the gags might over the kids' heads. I'm not talking sexual innuendos, just references to things older people could recognize.It isn't just the writing that is excellent; the artwork is spectacular, especially on Blu-Ray. The colors and the detail are just amazing! More than once, my jaw dropped at what I was seeing on the TV screen. Like the first Madagascar, the high-def images are truly spectacular.The combination of humor, drama, family and friendship ties and romance all make this a wonderful animated movie and the 90 minutes zip by.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Madagascar 2:  Return of the Penguins,"As with the comment ahead of mine: it's all about the penguins. They should have their own movie.We were chanting: more penguins, more penguins. At the screening we just saw, people who loved the first Madagascar movie waited excitedly for the magic to begin... I LOVED the first one. Interesting note: I liked the first one better, but my BF thinks this one has a better and deeper plot and pointed out in particular that while in the first one Gloria (the hippo) was the butt of many fat jokes, in this one she is celebrated just for being beautiful.The whole movie is breathtakingly beautiful. We didn't see this on IMAX but I bet the IMAX version will be a treat.Sascha Baron Cohen's King is again the hands-down favorite, I heard a ripple of joy murmur through the theater at everything he said and did, although my personal favorites (after the Penguins) are Maurice and Mort, the King's cohorts.BF was also teasing me mercilessly because (and I'm nearly ashamed to admit it) there's one scene that had me totally teared up! Yes, I cried. Can't spoil it - go see the movie and tell me after if you know what choked me up! The film did not hold the attention of some of the very small children at the screening we saw, because some portions of the film only involve adult storyline concerning the adult star characters (Alec Baldwin, Jada Pinkett Smith, Chris Rock, and so forth) but when the little characters are on screen (the baby lion in particular is DARLING) the children present were absolutely captivated.It's fun. It's not the greatest movie of all time, but it's very fun and children will want to watch it again and again.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
The penguins need their own movie,"I was never really a fan of the first movie, I thought it was a good premise but was poorly put together and the situations they found themselves in the first movie is just way out there. The Penguin quartet stole that show for me and was the only humorous thing that kept the movie from falling apart. I just saw this sequel just for the heck of it and in my opinion, this is a step above from its predecessor but however, not that big of a deal to me. I saw it, I laughed three or four times and maybe tomorrow I'll forget it. Its the same old schtick you saw in the first one, even that annoying old lady returns and your favorite castaways still find themselves in hilarious situations that are way out there.It was a good thing that they added more characters but it almost felt like they were just there for decoration. Maybe throw in a couple of hilarious quips and do something that a normal animal won't do and that's that. And like in the first movie, the Penguins still stole everyone's thunder and still kept the movie from falling apart. Forget the part where a shark hops and skips across the barren wildlife of Africa and the idea of an old lady going Rocky on an adult lion, I just wanted to see these penguins cause trouble but now in a different location. They deserve a spin-off, stat.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A perfect sequel; totally lived up to the first,"I was really excited about seeing the sequel to Madagascar, because I really loved the first and thought it was one of the best animations of the decade, regardless of how underrated it is, and this looked just as good, and in my opinion it almost was. Both of them are excellent films that are nothing but fun and are super energetic from the moment they come on screen, and this just made me appreciate the first even more than I already did, and am even looking forward to a third installment. The quality of this film might seem more fast paced and careless, but it is just as lovable.When it started up, I was immediately sucked in, and I never became uninterested and it never stopped entertaining, because they did an excellent job at keeping your attention just like the first. There were some parts in the movie where I felt as if they tried too hard to please the audience and then others it got a little dumb and boring, but overall I laughed insanely and was very pleased. When it was over I wanted to watch it again. It's a great sequel to a great movie and I enjoyed watching it as much as the first, as I have said. Some hilarious scenes like the plane crash, any scene with Moto Moto and of course Mort are lovable too. It's story is touching and fantastic as well, go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I like to watch it, watch it.","Just saw this at a discount movie theater ($2.50 a seat) and that's about what it's worth. Don't watch it expecting some major innovative work of art - it isn't, nor was it meant to be. It's purely fun fluff.Without a doubt, the penguins steal the show. Their banter and antics are just downright hysterical. Granny on the other hand, needs to be retired. A cameo of her might have been funny, but she is overused to the point of irritation.The ill-fated aircraft ride is a raucous ride, but after that the story splits into four or five (at least) concurrent sub-plots, so enough time isn't really given to each, and the pacing tends to jerk along in spurts. Basically it seems as if the filmmakers just strung together scenes of the funniest supporting characters from the original then tried to wrap it around a Lion King send-up.All that said, I actually liked this one better than the original. Not every movie is intended to be a piece of ground-breaking cinematic artistry and this certainly isn't. But it IS just downright fun to watch.

Cohen and the penguins steal the show again,"The original Madagascar film was one of my favorite animated movies of the decade because it was very original and outright hilarious, in addition to having the most amazing penguins the world has ever seen. In the second installment, however, the screenplay is sacrificed for better animation, and while it looks good, the film doesn't carry itself well, despite having a very short runtime.Our favorite zoo animals have been kicked out of New York and end up in Africa, where they quickly fit in with a pride of lions and other animals. Basically, from here, the film because formulaic, even for a children's animated movie. It's hard to believe they spent almost 3 years making this movie.Of course, most animated films are only as good as the voice actors, and while the big four of Stiller, Rock, Schwimmer, and Pinkett Smith are enjoyable, it's Sacha Baron Cohen who steals the movie once again as King Julien. His performance had me laughing on end for most of the movie, and I lit up like a lamp whenever his little rodent appeared on screen. The late Bernie Mac was also fun to have in the movie.The best thing about the movie are the penguins, bar none. They literally had me crying tears from laughing so hard. The actor playing the lead penguin is some sort of genius. I kept wanting every scene that played out in a straightforward way to end quickly so I could see the penguins again.Madagascar 2 is as beautifully animated as it is horribly written. There is so much attention to detail, making it the second most accomplished animated film this year in terms of picture quality. However, Madagascar 2 falls victim to cheesy lines, a stereotypical villain (a ripoff of a character played by Alec Baldwin, if you ask me), and formulaic plot resolution. I will say, however, that most of the jokes were good ones.Madagascar 2 is a tolerable kids movie that doesn't live up to the first film's glory as one of my favorite animated films of the decade. It's not terrible enough for me to hate it, or for me to not see the 3rd one that's already in production. I just hope that one tries a little harder in the writing department.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Someone's been knotty""","The sequel to ""Madagascar"" (2005) is by no means inferior to the original, and maybe even surpasses it. The reason probably lies in the fact that the same team made both films. Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria, accompanied by the inevitable penguins, cross from Madagascar to Africa and join their species with a lot of vicissitudes and healthy humor. ""Escape 2 Africa"" is full of witty remarks, puns, and references to cult movies and pop culture in general. It relies largely on ""The Lion King,"" but I've also noticed allusions to ""West Side Story,"" ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" ""Planet of the Apes,"" ""Airplane,"" Indiana Jones, ""Twilight Zone"" and many others.

Whattariot!,"Thank God the sequel to 2005's ""Madagascar"" turned out to be thoroughly enjoyable. Part Twos are usually scary territory, but I daresay this one outdid its predecessor in terms of storyline and packing in the laughs.It starts where Madagascar One ended: Central Park Zoo animals Alex the Lion (Ben Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer) and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) find themselves still stranded and eager to leave the island. The penguins have built a plane and successfully take off for NY when they crash land in the African wilderness. The NY Zoo animals try to fit in with their wild counterparts and encounter situations that challenge their friendship.Of course King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen), the surprisingly scene-stealing granny and the rest of the supporting cast provide added hilarity and wit to almost every repartee. Even more welcome was the relevant uplifting theme, which served as an effective sub-plot, an important message delivered in a fun, non-preachy way.

"Fun, yes, but largely unremarkable all the same.","There are movies that, to be fair, never quite do anything remotely significant or innovative; they lack purpose for their existence. When it comes to sequels, this factor comes into play even more so. Madagascar 2 by all means shouldn't have been made for any other reason other than that which gave it life in the first place. To be frank, there was no real reason for it to be made outside the fact that the first movie, although routinely mediocre, at least pulled in the green. Yet much like its predecessor, this second, mostly superfluous entry into the animated movie you never thought would turn into a franchise 2 years ago, at least has some intelligent and heart-felt design to back up its pointless endeavours. Fans of the original movie will love it; all the characters are back, and the humour remains in the same vein as instalment one, but even such customers will leave feeling a little underwhelmed by what is achieved here. Its fluffy entertainment aimed at families for holiday viewing, and in all honesty that is all it amounts to; fun, yes, but largely unremarkable all the same.This time around, the story attempts to fill in gaps from before the first movie, and then continue on from where that one left off. Leaving Madagascar in a dodgy, penguin-manned airplane, the four best friends fly off into the sunset hoping that they reach the U.S.A. once more. Such is the consequence of trusting a penguin however; all aboard soon find themselves in Africa after a very funny crash landing. From here on the movie branches off into numerous plot lines, some being larger than others. The most dominant of these centers around Alex once more as he finds out he has long lost relatives in his native land. Struggling to fit in with his more traditional friends and family, Alex is soon alienated from those around him in a touching and emotive manner.If there is one major fault with Escape 2 Africa's strict however, it's that it relies far too heavily on this type of melodrama to pull its story along. There's a fair amount of humor too, but I often found myself sulking in my seat rather than chuckling. Is this a bad thing? For Madagascar, yes. This imbalance towards drawing out tears means that the writers must invest more in drama and character, which this movie simply does not have enough of. That's not to say that such moments aren't welcome, because they are, but there's just too much here to keep things evenly entertaining.A much greater and well constructed element of Escape 2 Africa is its structure and sense of pacing in each individual plot line. Of course, much of these clash towards the climax of the movie, and the result is satisfying and well choreographed to blend together. Without bogging down the feature with weighty exposition and mundane setup, the writers manage to tie all the elements together in ways that feel natural to the story and characters; there were times where I was genuinely surprised to find minute details from earlier scenes playing larger parts in later ones; not only is it clever, but it serves the direction of the movie well and keeps things moving at a decent pace. I'm rarely one to be caught off guard by such a movie, but Madagascar 2 did it quite a few times.Visually and aurally, Escape 2 Africa is impressive insofar as most animated movies go. In terms of animation quality and design, the movie pulls out all the stops in making this one grander and more visually entertaining than the first. Character animations are crisp and full of life with backdrops and environments being just as, if not even more interesting to gaze upon. The performances from the central cast also bring with them an extra dimension of life; for the most part, this is strictly sequel material, and all actors stick to their roles as closely as they did for the first, but that's not entirely a bad thing. A common misstep with such features is that the voice actors feel distant and uninvolved with their animated selves, but such is not the case here with many often being echoed in the mannerisms of their animals in many humorous ways.So yes, there's no denying that Madagascar 2 is a pretty film, but is it one of substance? To some degree, yes, it is, but only in respect to the average animated fare. With the evolution and ever growing maturity of the genre however, one has to wonder whether Escape 2 Africa is anything new or refreshing. To be fair, there's a good mix of everything here from drawing out the laughs from children and adults to making them both feel a little something too -which is no small task-, so it at least provides it primary functions. Yet despite its pleasing design and well constructed façade, there nevertheless remains the irrevocable fact that much of what takes place here feels perfunctory for the sake of simply making another unnecessary movie. In that vein, Madagascar 2 loses some value, but not much. Fans of the original movie, plus those looking for a bit of family fluff for the holidays could do much worse than what is present here; Escape 2 Africa is fun and has its heart in the right place, even if it is all a little indistinguishable from its brethren at the end of the day.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)",,Anonymous,Animation
"They like to move it, move it... again...","I have seen the first animated ""Madagascar"" movie years ago, but can't really recall it. Nevertheless, I sat down with my 7 year old son to watch the sequel and I must admit that we were both quite entertained and amused with this movie.The story was quite good and you instantly gets swept up and carried away into the storyline.The characters in the movie were likeable and funny, and it really worked to their advantage that they had such a great ensemble of voice actors to perform the various roles and voices throughout the animated movie. Amongst those worthy of mentioning are Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Sacha Baron Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, Bernie Mac and Alec Baldwin.The drawing style and art style was good, and there was a lot of details in every scene throughout the entire movie. There was a good combination of music and singing and ordinary cartoon here, without it turning into a stereotypical animated movie like those seen produced by Disney.""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" is definitely worth taking the time to sit down and watch regardless of your age.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious and much better than the first one!,"This movie was so much better than the previous one! We went to see this one for my 25th birthday because we were in the mood for some light-hearted entertainment and we really hit the jackpot choosing this movie! Madagascar 2 is simply hilarious: the crazy and extremely violent granny, Moto Moto being too macho for words, the crazy king, the hippo lady being in the mood for some love, the love sorrow of the hypochondriac giraffe (whose voice is being done by ever funny David Schwimmer from friends) and the extremely smooth mafia penguins... This is just a great movie for young and old. I'm waiting for this one to come out so I can buy it. The least funny character according to me was the lion, but then again I'm not a huge fan of Ben Stiller's comic talents. If you're in the mood for a hell of ride, I advise you to go and see this one. You won't stop laughing from the beginning till the end.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Hilarious and involving,"I am not a big fan of cartoons but a friend forced me to watch this. I use IMDb as a true barometer to judge films and so was a little disappointed to see a below average rating for Madagascar 2. I will give it a 9/10.It had everything that a cartoon movie could ask for - animals with crazy human-looking faces, hilarious dialogues, simple story and finally some extra ordinary animation. The story is simple enough for every age group to be involved. I was particularly impressed with the reasoning behind the water problem in the jungle.Ben Stiller and David Schwimmer's voices deserve special mention.I haven't seen Madagascar 1 but my friend told me that this is a worthy and better sequel.

"""Not that great"" says 3 kids and dad","I took three kids, a boy aged 8, a girl aged 8, and a girl age 5. I'll spare you the plot. The boy gave it three stars out of four, but then again, he is amazed by the smallest of things and is lucky to get outside. He laughed some, and then left his hat inside the theater. The 8 year old girl gave it one star. She's a little dour, but she was right when she said it was boring. Since when does an 8 year old think any G or PG animated movie is boring? When it is. ""But you laughed at parts"" I said. ""That was during the previews, dad."" The five year old give it two stars. She's the level-headed one. She got really bored in the middle part. She woke me up to go to the bathroom. I haven't fallen asleep at the movies since I brought a date to some Merchant-Ivory film fifteen years ago. As for me, I give it two stars. The movie takes all the funny characters from the first movie, the lemurs, the penguins, and even the grandma, and gives them all bigger parts. Trouble is, they were funny in the first movie because they were used sparingly. Now that you are hit over the head with them, they lose their humor quick, especially the over-used grandma. And the rest of the characters are tired. No memorable songs, no memorable lines. Maybe they were jammed packed in the middle when I was sawing wood. Doubt it though. Sorry, this one's a rainy-day rental.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
the only thing that disturbed me was..,"The fighting scenes with the old lady. I really haven't found this funny and was quite shocked by it. Would definitely cover my daughter eyes not to see it...What message would that leave for kids, even if it's a comedy? This was just too much in my opinion. I like the music and would say a great work was done on animation at the end with captures. There were some sequences which I didn't get as why there were repeated the same words about ""Deja vu""? King Julian must have had something with his ears as well when Melman had to repeat more that he loves Gloria..Penguins were great again and my daughter's favourite is Moto Moto now:-).Despite that scenes of ""harrasing the old lady"" I like this even a little more than the original.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious!!,"Review By Kamal KThis movie really will give you a good laugh. It is about a new adventure of the four friends: Alex the lion, Melman the giraffe, Marty the zebra, Gloria the hippo. On the trip back to New York, they had an air crash and came to Africa instead. There, they found their roots and also came across some difficulties. In this movie, there are many supporting roles. And among them, the four little penguins played an important part and even covered the other main roles for their genius and humor. From the very beginning, the four penguins spoofed the DreamWorks icon. As for their popularity, the DreamWorks even planned to make a film about the Madagascar Penguins. I'm really looking forward to it. In this movie, the film makers pictured us an amazing Africa with wild animals and beautiful landscapes. The visual effects are pretty good and impressing. And I like the theme song ""Move It"", really making me full of energy and feel the desire of dancing with the characters. The last scene when Marty said that ""Love has no boundary"", I can't agree more. And I think that this does not only apply to love between lovers but also apply to love between friends and family. All in all, this is quite a funny movie and worth watching",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
over-hyped,"OK so I decided to watch this movie because many of my friends had seen it and said some good things about it. They said its much better than the 1st Madagascar so I decided to watch it. I've seen the first one, and loved it. Madagascar 2 is boring and lame, it had some decent moments but seriously its not that funny. I like the beginning more than the ending. And many of the jokes in this movie were ""adulted"". The penguins and lumors had most of them. I guess its somewhat interesting and entertaining but I was expecting more. It may be my fault because I watched this on the internet and had lots of distractions, I had many long breaks which caused the movie to overflat...but anyways, I think the movie could have been better and funnier",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Zany antics,This film continues the Madagascar story with a completely new setting that freshens up the franchise. Each character gets their own subplot that expands on their character and backstory. This allows for more antics but it also dilutes the overall story as they don't tie together much until the end.,6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hilarious!!! A thousand times better than the first movie!!,"I generally love animated movies but the first Madagascar did nothing for me. This sequel was absolutely hilarious!! From start to end it will keep you entertained. I feel as though the sequel caters to an older audience as well as the kiddies, which makes it way more enjoyable. The king as well as the penguins just stole the show in my opinion and made the movie a lot more adult friendly. This is definitely one of my favourite movies of '09 so far. The comedy was spot on and story had a lot more heart than the first one. I wont spoil the movie but its definitely a must see and believe me.. the worst part is when the movie ends its that good!!! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

7!? it deserves a 2!,"this movie is awful, its better Madagascar 1 far, very far, 7 is a lot for a comedy with 3 or 4 jokes, if the penguins weren't there this movie deserves Razzies, the Christmas special from the penguin its lots better than this.This movie Tries to be a fable, father gone, mother gone and the little Alex go to the zoo. Imagine all comic possibilities with this story, but the writer seems to be blind, he didn't saw that Madagascar 2 was to follow to a masterpiece, not a bad spoof.Really, IMDb users, reflect do you really think Madagascar 2 Africa deserves a 7, 5 its a lot for this movie, thats why I put it a 2.I hope dream works make a third, for make us forget this crap.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Manic, silly, and better than the original","IS MADAGASCAR 2: ESCAPE TO Africa ANY GOOD?

Loaded with hilarious non-sequiturs and inspired silliness.IS IT OKAY FOR YOUR KIDS? Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa is rated PG.

"A one-step improvement over the original and as a fan, it surprised me","I loved the original film as much as anyone else. It had a flawed story, a shorter time length, and a script that contained some humorous parts, but only some parts that were too predictable; but I loved it for it's charming characters and it's beautiful animation. So, when I saw that Dreamworks made this sequel to that film, I was only expecting this to be as good as the first, but sadly, I missed my only chance to see it in theaters of that year.Almost two years later, however, on my last birthday, I had the chance to get this on a DVD copy, feeling very desperate to watch it to see if it would whether or not be surprise me as much as the original even though that film had it's problems. Later, I became a bit surprised. OK, it's not as excellent as the previous film that came out the same year ""Kung Fu Panda"", but it's not one of Dreamworks' weakest (that goes to Shark Tale, Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas, and Bee Movie). The same characters are as charming as ever, but this time, they're much fleshed out especially King Julian and Maurice.Some of the new characters are great and I think the villain named Makunga voiced by Alec Baldwin isn't that bad of a villain, though he was underused and I liked Alex's parents as well. It's sad to see that Bernie Mac died just before this film was released (may his soul rest in peace), but I'm getting ahead of myself. The soundtrack from Hans Zimmer has improved a little in this film although it does have some generic bits. It does have some clever references which works for the comedy that got a chuckle/laugh out of me as well as it's witty and sharp dialog. There was also a scene that involved a relationship between Gloria and Melman which was so romantic and sweet to watch.The only two problems that I do have with this film is that while the story does have more heart than the original film, it's still predictable and does have it's similarities to the Lion King and Happy Feet and several scenes were dragged a lot throughout the movie. Aside from that, I said to myself, ""This is a great sequel."" I loved the original, but as a fan, this completely surprised and surpasses it as a much better entry of the franchise. Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa isn't an excellent film, but I totally recommend this to those who haven't seen it or the original film yet. It is that good!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very Funny!  (But Obviously Dervative),"To start with, the first ""Madagascar"" was not really an instant favorite of mine. The characters were a tad too shrill and neurotic for me. Over repeated viewings though, it grew tolerable for me. I was not really planning on watching this sequel, but the kids were insistent when we saw it showing in the mall last Sunday, so we watched it.It had the advantage of characters whom viewers have grown familiar with. Somehow they were able to intertwine a rather blatant ""Lion King"" storyline with a romantic side story to create this new movie. The feisty little old lady in the train station in the last movie has more than a mere cameo in this installment.I'm guilty to say I actually liked it. It is very funny. I was laughing out loud at certain parts. For all its derivative-ness, the way they tied around together into another cohesive whole was entertaining. Just go watch this for the laughs. The snappy repartee in the dialogue are hilarious! However, there is nothing really original about this. You have heard all its other messages before.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Poor Attempt To Capitalize On Previous Success,"I went into this movie with my wife and two kids (7 and 9) with an expectation of seeing a movie of the same general quality as the original. None of us enjoyed the movie. There is a long part in the middle that is really boring, and all the kids (and a lot of the adults) in the audience became very restless. There are some very sexually suggestive scenes that both my wife and I thought were inappropriate. After the movie when asked if they liked the movie neither of my children had anything positive to say about it. If you've seen the previews, you've pretty much seen all of the funny parts already.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A sequel that almost surpassed the original.,"Usually, when a film achieves remarkable financial success, the film industry arranges for space for one or two sequels. This is what happened with ""Madagascar"", but the sequel was able to maintain the initial level of quality. In this film, the attempt of the four zoo animals to return to the US fails and, by great coincidence (this only happens in the films), they end up falling in Central Africa, in the animal reserve where Alex was born, which allows him to know his parents and origins. The film is very good and fun, it retains most of the cast and voice actors of the original film and adds or recovers some characters, such as the Elder Lady, who gains some protagonism here, alongside Alex's parents. I also noticed that some characters who, in the initial movie, were secondary, were now approached for a more central space, a measure that was certainly the response to the affection they gained from the public. This is the case, for example, of King Julian. The four central characters do not change much, but the script tried to give them more space and attention to counterbalance the weight of several charismatic secondary characters. The script recaptures an old tradition of animated films and creates moments where it conveys moralistic messages, especially regarding the differences between individuals (the events between Melman and Gloria and Marty's dilemma with the other zebras are just two examples). Personally, I have nothing against this militancy implied in the film. Voice actors continue to perform flawlessly, as well as drawings, animations, and cinematography. Oddly enough, this movie is very poor in music or great songs. There are some, but none deserve particular attention.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Madagascar 2 is an un-needed sequel,"I haven't seen the first Madagascar movie in a long time, so after seeing the sequel, it almost feels the same. In the sequel, the animals are now stuck in Africa, and the plot is similar to the first movie. The animals must learn to survive in an unknown land, and they each ""chill"" with their individual species. This movie feels just as funny as the first movie, but the animation in the first movie seems to be better. Also, I don't really understand the title. ""Escape 2 Africa"" . . . the animals accidentally crash landed to Africa, so it shouldn't called ""Escape 2 Africa."" One part of the movie seemed too similar to The Lion King, such as the one ""bad guy"" lion who just happens to be a darker lion than all the others. The story also seems to focus only on Alex the Lion. The other characters, especially Marty the Zebra, have less of a role this time.Although the two movies feel about the same, I'm slightly leaning towards the first movie as the better one, just because the main characters seem to have equal importance.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Madagascar:  Escape 2 Africa was a pretty enjoyable Dreamworks Animation sequel,"Today, I went with my friend who works at a movie theatre to see this Dreamworks Animation sequel to Madagascar which he had seen twice before. I remember enjoying the first one a few years ago but I waited several weeks after when this one premiered sometime last month. It was pretty uneven in spots but many scenes where Alex (once again voiced by Ben Stiller) either fights or dances were very funny to me. And hearing the zebra pal (Chris Rock) listen other of his species look, talk, and act just like him was also good for a laugh. And how sweet it was to hear Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith) and that giraffe (David Schwimmer) declare their love for each other. Then there's those penguins, that lemur and his sidekick, and that small one being chased by a shark that provided their own amusements. And finally, there's Alex's father which is voiced by the late Bernie Mac (who like myself and the woman who voices his wife, Sherri Shepard, was born in Chicago, Illinois). Mac is simply both humorous and touching in the right places and what a nice dedication they put for him at the end credits. No great shakes here but for all that, I really enjoyed Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa especially when those penguins took over the Dreamworks logo...",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Nothing new, nothing bad, nothing really good","Picking up where the first film left of this one starts as our four heroes are attempting to fly back to New York as they have grown bored of the rich life the jungles had to offer them. As everyone is there to wave them off they take off but as it turns out they don't quite get back to the Big Apple.Instead they end up in a place that could be worse for them - and the party more or less continues. Not much can be said about this film without writing any major spoilers - not that there is that much to say in the first place - this film is an animation film for kids and therefor does not have any hidden trap doors and complex plot lines.For the kids its good fun with lots of laughter, dancing, a small bit of tension and a sense of good and evil. Nothing amazing in a positive or a negative way though - it's more run of the mill animation.

A total load of bad story coupled with silly humor....,"What an utter load of silliness! This is by far the worst most boring and meaningless cartoon I 've seen, for both children and adults in terms of storyline, action, humor, moral teachings, and overall fun... And I love (good) cartoons.... save your time & don't watch it!I hated the fact that the characters are not convincing at all. Also those impossible and silly things than happen all the time (yes, I know its a cartoon). Hey, see all kind of silly things that animals do in a jungle with a crashed plane and you'll know what I mean.I think the people that made that film are completely surreal, but in the bad-taste side of it. They tried to give these animals human characteristics - which is fine - but they completely missed the point.I give it a four cause the story even made me upset while I was watching this with my friends!",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the rare cases where I found the sequel to be better than the original!,"I first watched the original ""Madagascar"" in 2008, not long before the release of this sequel. At the time, I thought that 2005 DreamWorks Animation effort, as successful as it turned out to be, was fairly disappointing and not good enough to make me want to watch ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"". However, early last month, I watched the original again, and this time, it rose up from a six to a seven out of ten for me. After that, I did intend to watch this 2008 sequel. In my experience (and I'm sure many would agree), sequels can usually be expected to be inferior to their predecessors, but for me, that didn't turn out to be the case with this particular one. In fact, this sequel was better for me with one viewing than the original was either time I watched it!Alex the Lion, Gloria the Hippopotamus, Marty the Zebra, and Melman the Giraffe are still in Madagascar, but are about to leave on a repaired crashed airplane with Skipper and his military penguins, along with lemurs King Julien and Maurice, and the chimpanzees, on a flight back to New York. However, during the flight, the plane runs out of fuel and crash-lands on a wildlife reserve in Africa! This happens to be the reserve where Alex lived as a cub, before he was captured by poachers, fell into the water in a crate, floated across the ocean, and was adopted by the Central Park Zoo. So, he is now reunited with his parents. His father is Zuba, who is still the alpha lion of the pride, but another lion named Makunga still wants to take that position, and reminds Zuba that Alex must win the traditional competition in order to stay with the pride, which is not what Alex thinks it is! As the penguins and chimpanzees try to repair the damaged aircraft, Alex, Gloria, Marty, and Melman have each found other members of their species, but this leads to complications for each of the four former zoo friends.At the beginning of this sequel, with a flashback sequence showing Alex (then named Alakay) as a cub, I wasn't sure how much I was going to like the film, but that soon changed. The poacher chase is a good action sequence, and when the film gets to the present day, we see the animals boarding the plane in Madagascar, which is a very humorous part, especially with the King Julien character, once again voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen. The main voice-over cast returned for this sequel, and they once again did a great job, plus the characters are still entertaining, including the four leads and the military penguins. There are also some new characters here, such as Zuba, voiced by Bernie Mac, who sadly died shortly before ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" was released in theatres. There are so many funny parts in the film, with the chaos on the plane as it goes down, and a lot that follows the crash. There's also lots of excitement during the animals' African adventure, and unsurprisingly, the animation is amazing as well, just like it is in the original ""Madagascar"" and so many other CGI movies! The main thing that makes this sequel better than its predecessor is probably that it has a more interesting plot to keep it more consistently entertaining.Maybe not everything about this DreamWorks Animation film is great, but overall, it's another very good animated family movie, and unlike some sequels, this one is not a clone of the original, as it definitely has new things to offer. Many fans of the original ""Madagascar"" might be disappointed by this follow-up for one reason or another, but personally, I still think it's more consistent in quality. It was the first movie I watched after recently seeing the lame 1996 version of ""The Adventures of Pinocchio"" after all these years, and I would say watching ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" after sitting through that mess was a nice relief. It certainly left me in a better mood. If you like the successful 2005 CGI effort from DreamWorks, I think this sequel is well worth watching. Apparently, ""Madagascar 3"" has been confirmed, and obviously, we can't be sure right now how good it will be, but whether it's any good or not, the first two installments in the franchise are still both admirable accomplishments.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The Gang Is Back With Monkeys, Lemurs and Of Course, The Penguins","'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa' is definitely an improvement over the first movie. It's just as colourful but more energetic. The story has more heart and the characters Melman and Gloria are given more importance. This film, however, takes place almost entirely in Africa and there is very very little of Madagascar. But one will find many such inconsistencies and plot holes so the best thing to do, in order to enjoy it, is overlook them and have fun with the positive. The voice actors do a good enough job. The sequences with the lemurs were very amusing. I also liked the love angle between Melman and Gloria (awkward but endearing). The Alex subplot reminds one of Disney's 'The Lion King'. But again, it's the penguins who steal the show. They provide the laugh-out-loud moments with their comic timing and intelligence. Another funny sequence was with the old lady who has much more screen time in this one. Overall, 'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa' is a likable family film that is full of colour, energy and humour.",,Anonymous,Animation
Coming 2 Africa.,"'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa (2008)' is one of the rare sequels that I'd say is better than the first. It's no masterpiece, don't get me wrong, but I feel as though it's a more confident and focused affair overall. The first flick had a hard time deciding who it wanted to be its protagonist: Marty or Alex. In fact, it started out focusing on the former but ended up focusing on the latter. This film doesn't have that issue; its focus is firmly on its show-off of a lion. It's a very classic 'part 2' in the sense that it makes things a bit more personal, bringing in a new location with a connection to its lead character and using it to fill in his backstory. It's kind of like a less intense version of 'The Lion King (1994)', in a way. The other characters aside from Alex are sadly rather sidelined. Gloria and Melman are thrown into a rather uninteresting subplot consisting of romance, mass hypochondria, self-sacrifice and thicc hippos. Marty is, frankly, done dirty. His subplot consists of him coming to realise that he's exactly the same as every other Zebra on the continent, with even his friends struggling to tell him apart from his equally striped equine peers. This is really weird because the Zebras are the only species that all look and sound the same; every other type of animal has an appearance and voice that's distinct from the other members of their group. It's also really weird because the plotline's ultimate message isn't that Marty is actually unique in a meaningful way that he eventually comes to appreciate (as the set-up of the subplot would suggest), but (minor spoilers for this aspect) that he is indeed the same as every other member of his species except for the fact that he has a scar on his backside from when Alex bit him during the events of the first movie. His only defining characteristic ends up being a superficial scar. Huh? Who thought that was a good idea? I mean, it's a bit - dare I say - racist, right? Anyway, the rest of the story isn't exactly Shakespeare, but it's effective enough in propelling you through the picture's plentiful jokes. It's often rather funny and it hits the emotional beats you'd expect it to, albeit rather weakly. The penguins are still the movie's main highlight, but King Julien stands out as its best aspect overall; he's even more endearing than he was in his last outing. Overall, this is a solid animated adventure that makes a couple of missteps but is generally enjoyable and fairly funny. As I mentioned earlier, it's probably better than its predecessor. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Jungle Fever (Screen),"As i saw it the 1st January, it was my first movie of the year. If it gives a trend, well the year will be a happy ride.I was in the company of the kid of my friend, who had the luck to see the first part on TV right before. I never see it actually (just heard my old parents telling it was very funny) but after this sequel, I would like very much to take a look.About this one, I just fell ""in love"" with the lion Alex: there are a lot of animal characters in animation, but this character has a head above all others! He is really the King!First, he is really well drawn at all ages but he has also a kind personality: He isn't dumb nor too smart too, he loves very much his parents and crave for their acknowledgment. Friendship means a lot for him and he is very brave. It's a deeply rich character who has much to say! That's a change! Sometimes real actors haven't all this!!!In addition, he has a good team around him: the penguins, the monkeys and the hippopotamus, which in her way, is sensual! No kidding!The story isn't really the genius idea but rather serves to expand the growth and interactions between the characters. So you got fun, moving moments and that's nice! The kid & I had good times and we moved it, moved it.A special thought for my ex-colleagues because every time I saw the posters with the tag-line ""Always together, Always lost"", I think to them!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Funny and clever,"Until I saw Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, I would have rated Kung Fu Panda as my favourite animated film of the year. I still would rate Kung Fu Panda higher, but this runs it close! The penguins are, as ever, brilliant, and they steal the limelight in every scene they appear in. Marty has some interesting adventures and the scenes between Melman and Gloria are a joy to watch. It's hard to find fault with this film, and I implore anyone who enjoyed the first one to go see this one!The animation is also very slick, better than the first film and very bright. This is a wonderful film to look at, as well as listen to- the music and sound effects are, like the animation, first class.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie is actually funny!,"To be honest, I though that the first ""Madagascar"" movie was often being more irritating than funny. ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" is a big improvement however, as this movie is actually really pleasant to watch.The comedy has been really improved for this movie. While ""Madagascar"" was often more relying on its fast pace and lots of screaming and jumping this movie actually builds up its comical moments, providing the movie with plenty of laughs.There are lots of returning comical characters for this movie, as well as some new ones. The most fun characters from the first movie luckily make their appearance again but it also gives the new characters their room. It makes the movie a bit full perhaps when it comes down to all of its characters. You can even wonder if Marty, Melman and Gloria were truly necessary for within this movie. They often cause the movie to slow down and drag at points, as the movie in essence is mostly about Alex who is getting reunited with his parents after a failed flight back to New York from Madagascar.The story, though also not much special, is more interesting and memorable than was the case with its predecessor. The movie has a villain, a love story and basically everything else in it that is required to make a typical enjoyable animated movie with. The movie is fun entertainment for the entire family.The animations still aren't exactly top-notch looking when comparing it to different genre movies but in this movie this gets actually less distracting since the movie is simply almost constantly so fun to watch. The animations of course also still are an improvement from its 2005 predecessor but it really visually isn't the best the genre has to offer this present day.All of the big voice-actor names are back for this movie as well such as Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, Jada Pinkett Smith, Sacha Baron Cohen and Cedric the Entertainer. The movie its cast list got expanded this time with Bernie Mac, Alec Baldwin and Will i Am. It was one of Bernie Mac's final roles and this movie got also dedicated to his memory.A definite improvement over the first movie!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very mildly entertaining at the most.,"This is a harmless movie w/no real redeeming value & cardboard cutouts of all the characters. Worse than anything is the fact that the terrific voice cast is completely wasted which is a shame. In fact if Ben Stiller & Chris Rock had lent themselves w/some of their creative talent, this could have been a much better film. Hell an episode of ""Everybody hates Chris"" has more heart & laughs than this entire film. I think most kids will enjoy this, but it won't be anything lasting. What reminded me more than anything is the fact that this seemed like a wannabe ""Lion King"" but w/out the re-watchability & the fantastic story. Again this is a extremely mediocre film that wasted the great voice talents & a boring pointless plot too.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
How about going to Africa with cute animals?,"This movie is about 4 animal friends who go to Africa for travel. They arrived in Africa by accident because of penguins. While penguins fix their airplane, the king of New York, lion, finally meets his parents, and other friends realize that there exist animals which alike themselves in the world. In other words, they finally return to their home.A way to enjoy this movie is to look at the cute characters. Although they are animals, they behave like humans, and they are very humorous characters. Especially, I recommend the character, Moto Moto, which is acted by 'will I am.' There are also new characters such as a black hair lion, lots of monkey. Additionally, all the musics in this movie make the movie more funny.You don't need to worry about this movie. I think that Madagascar 2 is better than Madagascar 1. It's because new characters, musics, and the exciting story will make you enjoy this movie. Don't think! Just enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The return of the bad sequel,"After seeing the original Madagascar as few years back with the family, we all rated it as one of our all time favorites.

Unhinged slow predictable plot - c. That awful old lady and d. again that syrupy father-son relations issues that drag on and on.It should leave some of the old minor characters behind, get a quicker pace, some real plot and for crying out loud *a new song*Well, at least the animation was top notch as expected by major releases.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fogettable and unfunny,"This film is about the zoo animals trying to escape from Madagascar back to New York, only to find themselves in Africa.The jokes mainly comprise of the animals doing silly movements, and these are not funny. The plot is weak, and most of the screen time is occupied by animals dancing and singing. I understand the filmmakers are creating a festive atmosphere for Christmas release, but it is tiring and annoying to see hippos dancing, and then penguins dancing, and then zebra dancing, and then giraffes bouncing about.I am also very disturbed by the old lady who keeps hitting the animals. At one point, she incites other people to burn a lion alive. In another scene, a giraffe is talked into jumping into a volcano. This cruel acts to animals are unacceptable. ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" tries to make fun of these inhumane situations, which I find unacceptable. What kind of message are we sending to our children?""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" is a very forgettable film, and I was hugely disappointed by it. I was hoping it to be funny and entertaining, but it was not.",,Anonymous,Animation
Big improvement over the first one,"Honestly This movie is really underrated. It's like an underrated gem and it's a good one too. I like the African adventure, as well as some of the Clever and funny lines in the movie to
Especially the penguins, which had a lot of funny lines all throughout the movie The only bad thing about the movie was the villain is he laxs more screen time and relatability. Overall, this is honestly a very good movie you should watch. It's super clever at times and the music honestly just fits almost every other scene, and obviously, you can't forget about the icon Moto Moto who was a hilarious character.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A okay sequel,"It's basically impossible to make an acclaimed sequel if the first's not acclaimed itself so Madagascar 2 is one of the weaker DreamWorks 2nd chapters but hey this still scales above the first. This overall took the right direction and here are my praises
This was a funny film but the old grandma carries the comedy in this entire film. Without her Madagascar 2 wouldn't be funny because the rest of the comedic jokes and moments wouldn't land. And this also has some emotions with Alex's reunion with his parents and the weird romance between Gloria and Melman. And this also explores how the group doesn't have talents and they all struggle with self-worth which is the main message of this.Criticisms and Cons
Is it me or just Madagascar loves making Marty and Alex not get along . In the first Alex and Marty didn't get along and Alex being angry was annoying but they didn't need to continue their beef again with Marty getting offended. This was also a bit slow paced but overall I enjoyed myself during this

More goofiness and hijinx and less breakthrough animation can still work,"Dreamworks' ""Madagascar"" films have never been about trying to impress with lifelike animation, opting not to even compete with Pixar in that regard. Instead, they create very geometric, blocky characters that while uninspiring do echo the goofy and care-free nature of the films. ""Madagascar 2: Escape 2 Africa"" is an execution of fun. It relies on its clever, memorable creatures in order to compete against other animated films that constantly break animation barriers and tell inspiring stories. It's not state-of-the-art, but it's probably just as effective, at least as far as the profits are concerned.""Madagascar 2"" marks the return of Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman (lion, zebra, hippo and giraffe respectively) right where the first film left off (in Madagascar), although that's hardly important to understanding the movie. Knowing the first film only helps you get more quickly back into believing them. As these former escaped NYC zoo animals leave Madagascar, their inherently flawed plane crashes on an African tourist reserve stocked with animals like themselves, including Alex the lion's (Stiller) mother and father.The wit of these pampered city animals struggling in the wild continues as the characters learn lessons from their fellow animals. Marty (Rock), for example, meets a herd of zebras exactly identical to himself and he struggles with what makes him special. Family values, however, are still second fiddle to devious penguins swindling New Yorkers (who the writers slam on a lot) touring the plains and Nana, the dangerous old woman beats the stuffing out of people. It's all hijinx. Nothing is hysterical, but altogether it's quite amusing. It also never bores at 90 minutes long.The film is better than its predecessor, probably just because so little time is needed to reestablish the characters. The story picks up quickly and thrives off the characters that made the first one work. There's also a bit more to the story with the background characters being more than just lemurs. More of a full world is imagined in this one. It might not be a beautiful world, but it serves its purpose.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
It was totally Fun and Comedy,"The movie was totally Comedy and Fun. Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman are children at the beginning of the movie, that time all the children are very cute. When, all the zoo animals are travelling in a plane, that scene is totally funny. When Skipper announces that, ""I have some good news and some bad news, the good news is that we will be landing immediately and the bad news is we are crash landing,"" that scene is totally funny. After the plane is damaged badly, it has no covering and the seats are broken, that scene is totally funny. When, Alex does some actions to the animals in Africa and after sometime they talk English, that scene is totally funny. When the lions want to test Alex's fighting skills, that time he fights with the lion which has muscles and very strong, that scene is totally funny. Even, Melman has changed into a doctor that is too funny. Makunga looks like a pucca villain. I like Zuba because he is strong and he looks a real lion. When, Alex is fighting with the old lady, that scene is totally funny. When, King Julian tells that someone should sacrifice their life to the Water Gods, that time his voice is very funny. When Alex wants to prove the people of New York that he is Alex, that time he dances to prove, that dance is very beautiful. In the last scene, the plane has helicopter's chopper, it has no covering and it has wings which is not straight, that scene is totally funny. I should really appreciate the creators of ""Madagascar Escape 2 Africa.""",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A good sequel.,"The story I think improved although they sacrificed some humor. It may be less than the first but it still has its moments that make seeing it again worthwhile, especially the penguins, the old woman or characters like Melman or Gloria who were not the main star of the previous one (among other minor characters), and here as they were given more importance. Madagascar 2 is a movie that made me have a good time. I recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Some great Character Development,"The Lion is developed well hear, and his backstory from where he'd come from is deeply explored, it's both profound and deeply mesmerising and it sets Madagascar 2 apart from the first, in terms of quality and how great it is. The rest of the voice acting and the cast are really good. Especially Ben Stiller who does a fantastic job. The rest of the cast were good too. Again however, the film is mostly good, but the middle does drag, and aside from some good character depth, the film as a whole is rather lackluster and isn't very Entertaining in the middle section. However, despite it feeling slightly lengthy, it does a reasonably good job of what it's trying to do.

Builds on the strengths of the first film to be funny and fresh,"The New York zoo animals have decided to conclude their time on the island and return to their home in Central Park. Along with King Julien and a few others they board a retro-fitted plane designed and built by the penguins and set off. Things are going great for a while but it is not long before they run out of fuel and drop like a stone onto a reserve in Africa. To his amazement Alex finds he has returned to his birth home and has been united with his parents while the other animals all learn what it is to be part of a tribe and outside of the confines of the zoo community however it is not long before the friends find themselves being separated.The second Madagascar film didn't get great reviews off the critics, with it generally being met with a collective shrug with nobody having anything specifically bad to say or specifically good and, as a result I figured this would be fine on DVD rather than the cinema. I watched it last night and was pleasantly surprised to find that the film was an improvement on the first one  mainly because of lessons learnt from the first ones. I recall the first film as being significantly stronger in the side characters than in the main story and main characters and the same is true again here. The four New Yorkers are OK and they do drive the narrative which is better this time round even if it is a bit prone to moralising. One thing I did find a bit odd was a thread about how Alex could not tell Marty apart from all the different zebras  OK there was a bit of Rock joking about ""we all look the same"" but having it be an actual thread rather than an aside meant it did clunk around there without being refuted that much  a weird racial thing to have in the film but I digress.The main step up in quality though has come with reducing how much running time this takes up and increasing that given to the ""lesser"" characters. King Julien is a scream throughout and is a welcome return and of course the monkeys and penguins easily deliver good laughs without ever being asked to carry the narrative. The humans in the jungle are a bit of a necessary evil in regards the story but don't deliver much in the way of comedy  to me the elderly women is no more than n one-off visual gag, not a character. Mostly though the film is very funny with lots of good laughs but not too many rooted in pop culture references so that it will date quickly in the way other films have  and what references it makes tend to be more ""timeless"" ones such as the great Twilight Zone gag. The voices are impressive in the amount of names involved. Stiller, Rock, Smith and Schwimmer all do good turns, fitting their characters pretty well but the lion's share of the gags continue to fall to Cohen, Cedric the Entertainer, Miller and a few others. The additions of Mac and Baldwin work well too.Madagascar 2 is not a massively new creation that deserves special mention ahead of anything else good in the genre but it is certainly not a shrug of a film by any means. It builds on the strengths of the first film (the other characters) and makes a stronger and funnier sequel that is still not a brilliant thing but is definitely funny and fast paced enough to satisfy both adults and children.",,Anonymous,Animation

Good continuation,"The movie picks up, directly after the first one ended. Which is a pretty good thing. Story-wise we get character related sub-plots, so that everyone has something to do in the movie. The penguins get to play a bigger role (not a surprise, after their show-stealing performance in the first Madagascar picture) and have most of the funniest lines.For some it might feel a bit too much story/plot and I guess at least the really young kids, might not get everything, but they still will be entertained though. And while the movie is entertaining, compared to almost any Pixar movie, this seems like a fast food (snack). Not bad at all, but really great either.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"After the first false start (or first draft), the story finally takes off...","In ""Madagascar"", a hippo, a zebra, a giraffe and a lion from New York Central Park zoo were lost in an exotic location and the Lion into a big identity crisis. In ""Madagascar 2"" pretty much the same happens, only this time, the writers did their homework and provided enough development so the plot and the dozens of worthy subplots could fill in a one-hour-and-half format.So, the more I watched ""Madagascar 2: Escape to Africa"", the more the first opus looked like a first draft, the thing you write and then realize it doesn't work and improvement is much needed. Madagascar was a fun place but the jungle was so dense it created a feeling of entrapment with an overdose of greens and browns. The lemurs and the fossa were fun and cool but apart from King Julian, Maurice and that little Gizmo-like creature Mort; they could hardly steal the show, not when you had the penguins anyway. The one thing I particularly loved in the film was the endearing friendship between Alex and his zebra friend Marty, so I was expecting the sequel to develop this aspect a little more.Not only it did, but it also fixed all the problems the first film had. If the very setting of ""Madagascar"" couldn't work, the wild territories of the savanna did, which is not surprising since they had already proved to be a great vehicle for stories in a previous Disney movie. And while Gloria the hippo and Melman the giraffe were disposable sidekicks in the first, they were given the full individual development they were overdue by being confronted to their peers and to each other. In the first opus, the animals were straight characters discovering a weird universe, in the second one, they are straight characters meeting other straight ones, and the fun comes from the differences (or resemblances). And the sequel allows us to know more about Alex, who used to be Alakay, son of the local Mufasa: Zuba, voiced by the late Bernie Mac.The film's beginning is familiar material, the cub is taken by hunters while his father tries to rescue him but Alakay ends up in New York City and becomes the main zoo attraction, while his new friends comment his tendency to be a show-off. This move has already proved to work for DreamWorks with ""Shrek 2"", in the sequel, we've got to know the back-story of the main characters as it makes the perfect connection with the first while being emotionally promising. And in a way, this could have been the first film, with the same premise, like a false start that is fixed now, I guess the writers said ""gosh, where can't we put them, now? They've already been in Africa, I mean Madagascar is in Africa"" And someone must have pointed out that it's not the way people visualize Africa. So how about ""Madagascar"" in ""The Lion King"" territories?So let's make a second start and take the best from the film, the original quartet, Alex' nemesis: the old lady, King Julian, Maurice and Mort, and who's gonna fly them to Africa? The penguins (remember the first film ended with the boat out of fuel, good continuity). And the plane sequence is much more hilarious than the boat ship where all the animals were locked in a box, the penguins play the pilots and hostesses' part, King Julian is in the first class talking politics while Alex and Marty discuss some triviality. And the 'landing' was of course more spectacular and it made Melmann confess his love to Gloria, and it doesn't even come as shock, there had to be something between them. So, the plane crashes and the penguins estimate the delay to six to nine weeks, and you better believe they get it right. They'll even use the chimps to repair the plane, because they have opposable thumbs (damn Darwin), but they're not superior mammals for nothing and they'll know how to raise their voice for their workers' rights.So our friends discover Africa and when they admire the landscape, Alex has a feeling of déjà vu, probably remembering his childhood but it doesn't take a genius to know that this is a clever nod to Disney, and yeah, ""Dreamworks"" make a hilarious come-back to Africa with a story that is as entertaining and appealing; it's got love, fights, dancing, tribes' codes, and great character developments through many plots and subplots. Gloria meets the Alpha Hippo Moto-Moto, Melmann becomes the witch doctor and Marty questions his uniqueness after seeing all the zebra quickly learning his tricks. There's a gag involving their resemblance and they also have the same voice so that even Alex can tell his friend from the others. Everything was an improvement from the first and hell, they even improved the 'identity crisis'.After an emotional reunion with his parents, Alex must face the fact that he can't make his tribe proud because he only knows how to dance, disappointing his father and causing him to abdicate because he doesn't have the heart to banish his son, so Makunga (a slicker Scar voiced by Alec Baldwin, but in reality a self-centered loser) becomes the king. But the real troubles start when the waterhole dries up, and maybe this is the time for Alex to prove his value, his own way. It's not the ""remember who you are"" but the ""stay true to yourself"" (I just love the way he keeps the hat of shame all the time) as if there was really a little gay subtext with the references to dance as an opposition to fight.Watching ""Madagascar 2"", I thought of what I said about the first, it's like a long exposition and I can't wait to see the sequel. So, I saw it and I absolutely loved it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
More swearing in kid's movies,"Again, Madagascar goes the extra mile to expose our kids to swear words. Madagascar 1 spelled out the ""S"" word in what they thought was a cutesy way, ""Oh Sugar-honey-Iced-Tea!"", and to make sure your kids understand that swearing is A-OK with them they actually say the ""H"" word out loud in Madagascar2.Granted, most childless homes have these words flying around without any censorship but in most homes with decent parents and children under 14 (which Madagascar 2 is marketed to) you'll see that people frown on this sort of behavior. It's not hard to act like a responsible adult and edit out the swearing in children's films. Why is it Dreamworks can't seem to figure this out? I want my $30.00 back.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun Sequel that's Just as Good as the First,","Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a terrific voice cast.The movie is a very fresh sequel to Madagascar that I think is just as good,in fact probably better,than the first one.Its filled with more interesting characters and each of the four main characters are given their own story,which I really liked.I liked seeing all four of them dealing with a new life in Africa,particularity Marty as we see him hanging around a ton of Zebras who look and sound exactly like him,I thought this was a funny set up and seeing how sensitive Marty was about being unique,it was a good choice.Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is a very enjoyable movie that fans of the first one will definitely enjoy.As they fly back to New York,the animals crash land in Africa,where Alex is reunited with his parents,although he must fight to prove he is worthy to stay.Meanwhile,we see the rest of the gang get use to a new life in Africa.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very mixed film,"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa The Good: Madagascar 2 is a very funny film, and I laughed quite frequently throughout. The penguins are even better this time around, and the comedy is far, FAR improved from the last movie. The animation is terrific, though I still don't understand why they had to make all the characters so blocky. Seeing amazingly detailed fur rippling on a character model that looks like it was made from legos is very disconcerting. Still, the movie overall looks great, and is a definite improvement over the original.The Bad: The comedy is great, but the story was weak and every single attempt at seriousness fell utterly flat. Amidst all the great comedy, the film decided to add unwholesome amounts of painfully bad dramatic scenes, which clash utterly with the hilarious moments in which the movie doesn't take itself seriously. Every time the film tried to tug at my heartstrings or attempt to extract some sort of emotion out of me, I just wanted to throw up. It's almost like experiencing the tonal changes from the two acts of Hancock every five minutes. I think that this is largely because the main characters in Madagascar simply aren't terribly good. While Shrek or most Pixar movies have memorable casts of hilarious yet well-developed characters, Madagascar just seems to have placeholders that try to have personality, but really are overshadowed by the supporting characters (cough penguins cough). Finally, this film borrows so much from other movies that it's almost plagiarism. A main character wants to dance instead of doing what the others do? Gee, where did that come from? A scheming lion uncle attempts to overthrow his kind brother while getting on his son's good side? How original! I usually don't mind films borrowing from others, but it was so blatant in this one that I sometimes wanted to scream.The Consensus: Overall, I don't know whether to recommend this movie or not. If it had just kept it's tone lighthearted throughout (like Shrek 2, Over the Hedge, etc.) of just stayed serious and dramatic (The Lion King, Wall-E), it might have succeeded. As it is, it tries to mix two very contrasting tones and ends up something of a mess. Still, it's better than the first, it's quite funny, and I'm sure children will enjoy it, so I guess on a Saturday night with the kids, you could certainly do worse.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Colorful with a deeper story,"I think the level of this one is about the same as Madagascar (2005), but it has a deeper story, and nicer animation - especially the colors. It was fun to watch, and it lived up to my expectations as a sequel. Recommending!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Madagascar 2 is a film that has a place for everyone, balanced in its plot, hilarious in its clever dialogues and that will, with this, please the general public","When released in 2005, Madagascar did not have many differentiators in the face of the digital animations that constantly arrived and still reach theaters, but it was a huge public success, obtaining almost US $ 500 million in worldwide revenues. As in all the great North American studios the word profit goes hand in hand with the word sequence, in exactly three years we have a new adventure led by the friendly Alex, Melman, Gloria and Marty.The film begins with a prologue that tells how the lion Alex was captured in Africa and taken to New York to be a star at the Municipal Zoo, a hint of what will be the central plot of this second volume. Right after that, we see a retrospective of the events of the first tape showing how Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman ended up in the middle of the jungle in order to refresh the viewers' memory and re-introduce us to a character who will return here. At present, our friends are preparing in the midst of their last rave to leave the island of Madagascar for civilization. The precarious penguin-driven plane, however, does not fly very far and lands in the middle of an African reserve. There, Alex will reunite with his family and the others will get to know for the first time what life is like in packs. Parallel to the plot involving the feline protagonist, Marty feels bad because he discovers that he is exactly like the other zebras and Melman discovers his lifelong passion for Gloria.With little charismatic characters and an unimaginative script, the first film, by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, only really came to life when it focused on hilarious penguins with military discipline or the maddened King Julien - who, unfortunately, had little screen time. However, Madagascar 2, by the same directors and creative team, is full of good intentions. And the game starts before the movie, on the DreamWorks logo, with the penguins led by the ""hallucinated"" Captain, playing a trick on the boy sitting on the moon. To try to bring closer the characters that please children, they have ""a certain charm"" there, but they do not excel with the less childish public, they went back in time with Alex (lion), Marty (zebra), Gloria (hippo) and Melman (giraffe), all young. So, you will know how Alex got to the New York Zoo. And get more involved in this curious story of friendship between fully humanized animals in the way of talking and acting, but wild when the goal is to have fun.After a quick presentation of the group's origins, Madagascar 2 begins to weave its plot, taking everyone to a visually true Africa. And once there, the characters live a tremendous identity crisis. Alex (Ben Stiller) discovers that his successful choreography at the big apple zoo makes him ""dance"" in his homeland. Marty (Chris Rock) almost freaks out when he comes across identical beings because he thought he was ""exclusive"". The hypochondriac Melman (David Schwimmer) decides to reveal his love for Glória (Jada Pinkett), who ends up discovering that beautiful is what we see. Not what others see. It is worth remembering that all this happens with funny moments and creative dialogues. The ""The Lion King"" moment when Alex meets his family is noteworthy. The comparison with the Disney classic is inevitable. It has the scene of the paw of son and father, it has a villain with dark mane and style similar to Scar and it has Simba's own innocence.There is little of Madagascar this time. If the four friendly animals fled the New York Zoo before and ended up falling on the island of Madagascar, this time when they try to return home, they end up in the middle of the African continent, going directly to their origins. We are in the heart of Africa, with savannas, dense forests, hunters and new dangers. And, of course, a lot more humor. The protagonists - the lion Alex, the zebra Marty, the giraffe Melman and the hippopotamus Gloria - remain ahead of the plot, but the hilarious supporting characters have gained a deserved prominence, especially penguins and lemurs. So, you need to be really attentive to not miss any joke, as they are machine-gunned on the screen without mercy.Even though the film itself revolves around Alex, thanks to the skillful script by Etan Cohen, one of the writers of the great Tropical Thunder, all these parallel subplots lose their prefix and live together perfectly, each walking on their own legs, at the same time, with enough strength to converge to the same, without making anything forced. The whole story of Madagascar 2 seems to pass smoothly, making it delicious and, at no time, tiring. The narrative is just an excuse for good jokes involving, again, the supporting actors who, this time, have the company of a bunch of funny rowdy monkeys. However, the writers could have created more interesting antagonists. There is the classic ""evil lion"" that is envious of Alex's father and, until then, there was not much way out. The unusual is the choice of American tourists as villains, among them the lady who beats Alex at the train station of the first film. It doesn't make a lot of sense and it sounds extremely forced, but, after all, Madagascar is not a franchise that aims for great flights in terms of originality. The big problem is the repetition of gags, which ends up tiring the viewer. But despite this, seeing that apparently fragile lady beating lions and ""leading"" the group of lost tourists, yields some of the best scenes in the animation. Although repetitive, it is hilarious.Knowing about the weakness of the plot, the writers then start to work on what worked in the first film and dedicate much of the work time to the penguins and their quasi-military operation to rebuild the plane that brought them there. Thus, the highlights are carried out by King Julien talking about his silliness and the penguins having to deal with the strike of the monkeys. On the side of the four heroes, the only story that really deserves to be highlighted is the case of Gloria with Moto Moto (Will i Am), a hilarious conquering hippo. Obviously, the film only really works thanks to its humor, subtle time, crunchy time, but always very well balanced within what it needs to make everything work. The most important thing, perhaps, is the care with which, apparently, it all balances itself in a fine line between adult entertainment and children's cartoons, managing to amuse all ages.Enriched by the contrast between the stylized design of the characters and the realistic look of the ""scenarios"" in which they are inserted, Madagascar 2 is much more ambitious in its aesthetic approach than the original: in addition to the fluid and ""seductive"" movements of Moto- Moto, the DreamWorks / PDI team of animators does particularly well in bringing Makunga's expressions of cynicism to life, also impressing in the sequences that involve hundreds of animals moving independently. Furthermore, the preciousness of portraying the age spots of old King Zuba is a detail no less fascinating than the anabolic body of the lion facing Alex in the arena, proving that, from the obvious to the subtle, the film is technically impeccable - worth watching, also, good photography, which simulates even the sudden exposure to light when the protagonist leaves the dark cave and is faced with a broadly lit environment.And if DreamWorks / PDI normally exaggerates the funny references to other productions, this time at least the jokes appear much more organic, from the tribute to Lawrence of Arabia (with King Julien in place of Peter O'Toole) to the quote from scene on the plane of Almost Famous, passing through the choreography of the gangs of Amor, Sublime Amor until arriving, of course, at the scene that refers to one of my favorite episodes of the series Beyond Imagination (the one that, directed by Richard Donner, brought William Shatner as a man who, fresh out of the hospice, was terrified by the image of a creature about to sabotage the plane on which he finds himself.Including very shallow moral lessons at its core, such as ""Love transcends all differences!"" And having recurring passages from the worst examples of romantic comedies, in ""It's crazy to think that I crossed half the world to find out that the perfect guy lived next to me!"", The animation is worth a joke, penguins and King Julien , but it deserves discredit for taking away all the charisma and differential from the main characters. Even this time, with their directors taking great care not to let the penguins once again steal the film, but which still work perfectly, and of course, steal the show when they appear, this time, with the help of the pair of chimpanzees, Madagascar 2 is exactly that: a film that has a place for everyone, balanced in its plot, hilarious in its clever dialogues and that will, with this, please the general public, with its simple and pleasant way of being.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A wildly entertaining sequel,"""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,"" directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, continues the adventures of Alex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman as they try to return to New York but end up in Africa. This sequel brings the familiar gang to the wild, leading to new encounters and self-discovery.The animation is vibrant, and the voice acting by Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, and David Schwimmer remains top-notch. The film introduces new characters, like Alex's parents and the charismatic Makunga, voiced by Alec Baldwin, adding depth to the story.While the humor and slapstick comedy are entertaining, they can feel a bit overdone at times. The storyline, though fun, follows a predictable path and lacks the originality of the first film. However, the movie's heartwarming moments and messages about family and identity resonate well.Overall, ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" is an enjoyable, family-friendly movie that delivers laughs and colorful visuals, even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of its predecessor.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Back with Pride,"Despite no air conditioning and several screaming babies in the theater, I thoroughly enjoyed ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"". Even though according to my bud Ron, ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" had 37% more penguins, I was initially unconvinced. Directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath's ""Madagascar 2"" proves far more than the broad children's animated feature. ""Madagascar 2"" has a great story of love and family by Etan Cohenmuch better than the original story in ""Madagascar"". ""Madagascar 2"" is also hysterical. When lion Alex (Ben Stiller) and bud zebra Marty (Chris Rock) attempt to demolish a dam, Alex asks, ""Do you have any dynamite?"" Marty (Rock) wryly exclaims, ""Snap! I just used my last stick"" To their credit Directors Darnell and McGrath expertly balance funny and sentimental. Visually, ""Madagascar 2"" is breathtaking particularly in its sweeping African vistas. Hans Zimmer's musical score is equally spectacular.At the beginning of Cohen's narrative we discover the origins of lion cub Alex, and his fated path to the Central Park Zoo. Following the logical conclusion of ""Madagascar"" our heroes Alex (Stiller), Marty (Rock), hippo Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith), and giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer) are flying back to New York aboard the airplane piloted by head penguin Mort (hysterical Andy Richter) and his crew. Along for the ride are Lemur King Julian (comic genius Sacha Baron Cohen) and Maurice (funny Cedric the Entertainer). Predictably the plane never makes it to New York, instead crash landing in the heart of Africa. But before crashing Melman proclaims his unrequited love, ""Gloria I love you!"" to a snoring Gloria, much to the amazement of Alex and Marty.Alex is soon reunited with his long lost father Zuba (the late Bernie Mac) and his Mom (sweet Sherrie Shepherd). Zuba proudly welcomes Alex to the pride. But not everyone rejoices, particularly rival lion Makunga (the great Alec Baldwin). The slithery and devious Makunga (Baldwin) schemes the demise of Zuba and Alex. The civilized and domesticated Alex finds he is soon out of his element, and Zuba begins to wonder if indeed his son is really destined to become the next Lion King. Here the story evolves unexpectedly into a poignant tale of great expectations and unconditional love. Mac brilliantly captures the spirit of Zuba, and he and Stiller have amazing chemistry. For comic relief while Melman yearns for Gloria's affections, Gloria is attracted to alpha male hippo Moto Moto (Will.I.Am). Mort (Richter) and his penguin crew squelch a chimp labor uprising in their quest to rebuild their airplane. And of course there is tough Grandma kicking some serious butt. Stiller, Rock, Smith, and Schwimmer are all natural and fit comfortably into their roles. Alec Baldwin and Sacha Baron Cohen demonstrate their comic prowess and take no prisoners.""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" works with its surprisingly touching story of family blended with its sense of the hysterical and absurd. Gangster penguins piloting the friendly skies are completely hilarious and ridiculous. Mostly, ""Madagascar 2"" works because we care about their characters, and we have a vested interest in things turning out well. ""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa"" is enjoyable and definitely worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The cast selection was alright enough. It could have been better. They did not exactly fully commit to the storyline nor to their respective characters. The chemistry between the cast members was not strong enough. This second instalment film reveals to viewers the true reality of what family should mean.

"Escaping, crashing, or vacationing, it's still a good time","Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa? After watching the film, something about the title, when you say it, doesn't sound right. Even if you've read the plot, the title doesn't make too much sense. The plot involves Alex the lion (voiced by Ben Stiller), Marty the zebra (Chris Rock), Gloria the hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), and Melmen the giraffe (David Schwimmer) as they wind up fleeing the country of Madagascar in the very beginning of the film in a junkyard plane, flown by the pesky penguins, with hopes of reaching New York City. They crash-land in Africa, with no intentions of escaping to there. I guess they wanted to find a way to employ a title of uniqueness.No bother. It's not a huge distraction. Especially considering that the film is a notable improvement from its predecessor. Sometime during the three year break between Madagascar and its sequel, the brewing franchise found direction, hope, and audacity and created a sequel effectively better than the first - a rare quality indeed.Continuing on with the plot, the film opens with nice backstory showcasing how Alex, whose birth name was apparently ""Alakay,"" was born in Africa to two loving parents. His father was Zuba, the alpha lion of the entire land. He turns his back for a few seconds, and Alex is lured to a group of animal poachers and is crated up and taken away. Zuba chases after him with no luck, and Alex's crate doesn't survive a rocky turn, catapulting him into a river. He floats to New York City, is greeted with open arms, and is quickly put into the Central Park Zoo where he will obtain a loyal following of fans. Despite being very dark and somewhat depressing, the elegance of it all sort of gives the picture a Lion King style quality I was not expecting.Then the whole ordeal with the planned flight, intriguing plane crash, and acceptance of being stranded again takes place, before we finally get something else delightfully unexpected; the characters separating. In the original Madagascar, the four animals stuck like clue. In this picture, they go off on their own for a good chunk of the film and sort of evolve into believable animals. The whole quality of the animals sounding like actors and not like their own individual self? Still present, but hidden behind the depth of the storytelling. Alex catches up with his father and mother, Marty desperately seeks confidence in his originality, Gloria finds a plump man, and Melmen becomes the ""alpha-doctor?"" and frets over confessing his love to Gloria; one of the many sweet love stories the film brings. There is also the obligatory evil character Makunga (Alec Baldwin), Zuba's rival lion, who adds some nicely placed tension to the film whenever he comes on screen. And even King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) returns to provide some nice humor.And did I forget to mention those four troublesome penguins? They get much deserved screen time in the picture, providing levels of insight and wittiness complimented by the film's overall narrative, which is more controlled and well-kept rather than so kinetic, jumbled, and anarchic. Is Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa on the same level as a Pixar film? No, but it works as a welcomed rebellion to the company. It sort of reminds me of how in decades past, animation films were theoretically monopolized by Disney, and few films (I can think of Bebe's Kids and Cats Don't Dance) challenged that assumption and ventured out to create their own world. Madagascar's sequel shows its sentimental side I was asking for during the original film. It's a balancing act of humor, sentimentality, and creativity, and is all captured pleasantly.Voiced by: Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith, David Schwimmer, Sacha Baron Cohen, and Alec Baldwin.

A good sequel to a good original,"The beginning of this movie is great as it shows how Alex the Lion got to becoming a popular attraction at the Central Park Zoo. The transitioning to showing where we last left off with the main characters is also great as we see that they are leaving Madagascar to try and head back to New York. However, the engines fail and Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria, along with Julian and Maurice, end up in Africa. The friends try to adapt to life in Africa while the penguins try to fix the plane by hijacking all of the tour jeeps. Alex runs into his mother and father. His father is voiced brilliantly by the late great Bernie Mac. Marty, Melman, and Gloria run into many of their own kind.This movie is full of fun and some new adventures and schemes from the ever awesome penguins.

Chris Rock is the best!,"I don't know why it took me so long to see this movie or why I'd never heard of it, but I caught ""Madagascar"" on cable one day and decided to check out part 2 this week. Loved it. It's a coin toss whether I'll like an animated film, but this one was great. It had some of my favorite comedians in it (Chris Rock is #1, Bernie Mac is #2 and Cedric the Entertainer is in my top 10). I'm a big fan of Jada Pinkett Smith since her ""A Different World"" days (her behind-the-scenes interview with Willow putting her on blast was funny) and I was absolutely entertained by will.i.am as Moto Moto. That song ""I like 'em big, I like 'em chunky"" killed me. Those two hippos flirting was bananas. But it wasn't just those characters. I liked the entire cast, all the voices, the humor, the scenery and the pace. There are no flaws. I'm slightly scared of the ""bad kitty"" old lady. If I ever need a bodyguard, I'm checking for someone like her first.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Broad slapstick humour and generic life-lessons,"When an animated family film unexpectedly strikes a chord with its young audience and develops into an unexpected hit, as was the case with 2005's Madagascar, the most common problem faced with the inevitable sequel is where to take its collection of rag-tag anthropomorphic heroes next. The original's premise was relocating a bunch of animal characters who had been raised in a New York zoo to be adored by the paying customers to the less-welcoming island of Madagascar. It was a promising idea, but the film fell flat thanks to some blocky animation and a lack of imagination and jokes. With the first sequel, returning directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath have pulled the same trick again, only this time dumping its hapless entourage onto the brutal plains of Africa, with Hollywood again apparently forgetting that Africa is a continent, not a country.After the adventure on Madagascar, zoo animals Alex (Ben Stiller), Marty (Chris Rock), Melman (David Schwimmer), Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith) and a small group of militaristic penguins have fixed the crashed plane and are readying to fly back home. Also joined by unhinged lemur King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen), they crash again in Africa after running out of fuel, and eventually find themselves at a watering hole, where they are overjoyed to discover more of their own species. Alex also reunites with his mother (Sherri Shepherd) and father Zuma (Bernie Mac), with the latter the alpha of his herd. While the others are each given roles in their animal society, Alex must prove himself to be worthy of his position of heir and title of 'King of New York', while fellow lion Makunga (Alec Baldwin) waits eagerly to take control.It's a very similar route taken by Ice Age and their increasingly tedious sequels. When the big idea has been used up, simply introduce a long-lost family member and give the comic relief side- kicks their own meandering side-stories. Melman, due to his hypochondria, becomes the village's witch-doctor; Marty struggles to stand out in a herd that looks and talks in the exact same way as he does; and Gloria is courted by a douchebag while she misses the true love right in front of her eyes. The only relief on offer is when the penguins are on screen, and their extreme competency with any given task and frequent bashing of an annoying old lady never fails to raise a chuckle. When they're not the focus, we are stuck with the incredibly uninteresting Alex and a bunch of generic life lessons for the kids watching. If you were content with the little charm of the first Madagascar, then chances are you'll find something to like her. For the rest of us, this is a slow trudge through familiar ground chocked full with broad slapstick prat- falls.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not a very good movie.,"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa was not the best animation i have seen and it had a very uninformed plot line. In the beginning they had to retell the old story to put in another detail they didn't before. There were a lot of parts that looked as if they were trying to be funny but they weren't at all. There were a lot of pointless parts of the movie and it showed the action of Alex the Lion way to much like a little lion cub. Also it makes no sense that the movie is still called Madagascar even though it's in Africa now (even though Madagascar is in Africa). I thought this movie would be like the first one but it has almost nothing to do with zoo animals in the wild. There were good, funny parts in the movie but not many. There was also WAY to much sexual references, to much for kids under the age of 12. The movie had more interaction with the teens at the theater than the kids did. I heard the kids laugh about 3 maybe 4 times and then were really happy when ""I like to move it move it"" was in the credits. There were also way to fast changes in the movie, It went from one thing to a completely different, along with too unrealistic things. Even though it made me laugh, it was not a well written, acted, animated movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Still together, still lost.","Madagascar is perhaps one of the most successful franchises of the 2000s decade along with Shrek, Ice age (from blue sky) and Kung fu panda. Lots of children and adults fell in love with Alex the lion, Marty the zebra, Melman the giraffe, Gloria the hippo and of course the penguins and King Julien. It's first movie grossed half a billion dollars worldwide, so Dreamworks decided to bring the zoo crew back to the cinemas in 2008 with the sequel called Escape 2 Africa (also previously known as the crate escape). As for my thoughts on their first installment, it's one of my favorite movies ever. No matter how many times I watch it, I never get tired of it. But this review is about their first sequel. Does it live up to it's predecessor? The short answer is yes! But why? Let's find out!On Madagascar, the characters decide to use Julien's old airplane to go back to New York city, everything goes well, until their plane crashed in an African wild reserve. Here, Alex meets his long lost dad Zuba (Late Bernie Mac). When Zuba heard about that his son survived, he wanted to crown him king. But there's also Makunga (Alec Baldwin) who wants to take down Alex and be the ruler instead. As for other characters, Gloria falls in love with Moto Moto (Will. I. Am), which makes Melman envy of. Marty meets lots of lookalikes and joins the herd, while Penguins try to fix the plane with duct tape and a whole bunch of chimpanzees! The humour is mostly the same as last time, by having lots of slapstick and hilarious dialogue. My favorite joke has to be when Julien decided to fly along with the main characters, because it's his plane. Another great moment is when Melman thinks that he's going to die because of his sickness, but Julien tries to motivate him and telling him that he will still be with Gloria no matter what. I also liked the backstory of Alex and how he became the famous king of New York city that everybody adores. It's very emotional, considering the fact that Zuba didn't knew what happened and thought that he died, because he was fighting with Makunga when young Alakay (old name of Alex) was chasing the butterfly and was caught by hunters. Luckily he was freed in The central park zoo and was beloved ever since. The new cast was interesting as well as the old ones. Makunga is pretty similar to Scar from the lion king by being a vengeful character that wants to take Zuba's place. Except he's more comedic and less serious. He always overacts in any situation, but he's also very smart, his plan actually led Alex to being kicked out of the lion pride. Another villain featured here is surprisingly Nana from the first movie. She still likes calling Alex a bad kitty and beating him up with a bag, but this time, he tried to stand up to her in a scene where both were fighting when they met again, it was great, because the fight was cartoonishly funny. My favorite new character is Moto Moto. He is shown as a superior boyfriend for Gloria, by being more confident and tough. The old characters are still the same! Which is great because none of them became hateable. Although Julien was a bit dislikeable around the end, but I won't tell you why due to spoilers. I must say, that the animation became worse. Not because of the rendering or the technology, in fact, the characters still look the same, but the backgrounds became more bland with only pastel and dark orange-yellow shades being shown, compared to the first's color pallet which had vibrant blue-green shades. But at least they still look well done.Overall, it's a great sequel worth watching for those who enjoyed the first story! Also our little buddy Mort has a side story where he tried to follow the gang in Africa. Here he reminded me of Scart from ice age, because he was always running away from danger, in this case it's a shark. These scenes are funny and it will have an impact in the end of the story. It's fun, interesting and enjoyable for all ages.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

I like to . . . MOVE IT!,"I think this is my favourite of the three films. It's less about Alex and more about everybody else. I absolutely love Melman's character and King Julian definitely needed more air time. The penguins are genius, but I'd like to see more of the monkeys.
There's a style of humour in here for everyone, fortunately for me, I like many styles of humour, so I repeatedly win throughout.This time the crew have got as far as Africa and somehow landed right where Alex grew up. Chaos follows as M'Kunga, a rival Lion stirs the pot and King Julian decides to make a sacrifice to the rain Gods. Meanwhile the others are all having their own adventures and I think that's why this film is slightly better, everyone gets the chance to shine and we really get to see their characters in a bit more depth.There's still hope that they will return to New York, perhaps they will in number 3?",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Escape From Dreamworks Mtn,"Not being a fan of part one, watching 'Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa' did little to change that. Sure, some of the scenery and computer graphics were excellent, and some of the heart-felt moments were nice to watch, but overall, it seemed I was not the target audience. I would solely recommend this to families, especially with children 3 on up, though it did touch on more than half a dozen or more subplots that might confuse some kids. Once again, the (unfortunately few and far between scenes involving the) penguins and the monkeys were the highlights and the low point included the familiar 'Friends' Ross character (now computerized.) David Schwimmer, my least favorite on the NBC show, can't seem to, well, escape that role. All 'M:E2A' really did for me was miss the magic and wonder of 'Disney's The Lion King' as there are more than two dozen similarities in this feature. Sad, 14 years have passed, and nothing Dreamworks can come up with can come close to the masterpiece 'Lion King.' I guess they were aiming for the dumbed down, toddler-joke version.

Good sequel that lives up to the first,"The first of the two Madagascar sequels was funny and original, and the second is almost great as the first one, with many new characters.Here Alex, Marty, Melman and Gloria leave from Madagascar with a decrepit plane ''fixed'' by the lemurs and the four penguins, but it suffers a crash-landing and they end in Africa. After a fight encounter between Alex and the old lady, the quartet discovers that they are ended in Africa, and soon: Alex is reunited with his parents, Gloria meets an handsome male hippo, Melman becames the witch doctor of a giraffe group and Marty meets many other zebras identical to him.But then problems begin: there is another lion, Makunga, that uses the excuse of the rite of passage to dethrone Alex's dad and replace him as the king; Marty considers that he is not unique, and only Alex helps Marty to be different because of his qualities; Melman thinks that he is soon to death and Gloria doesn't like Melman anymore. Then Alex, with the help of the wrecked plane destroys the dam and makes the water return in the reserve, and then Gloria returns attracted to Melman, while the old lady with a group of tourists tries to survive in the African wilderness by themselves.The plot of the movie, in Alex's side, is a bit recycled from ''The Lion King'', only that here the villain is alone, and not with three stupid hyenas as his henchmen. And at the beginning the three penguins replace the boy in the Dreamworks logo.The animation is always great and colorful like in the first movie, the soundtrack is also good (and in the end credits there is Will. I. Am's cover of I LIKE TO MOVE IT MOVE IT), and the actors are all good, especially Ben Stiller and Chris Rock as Alex and Marty, Alec Baldwin is deliciously evil as Makunga, and Bernie Mac (in his last movie) gives a great performance as Zuba, Alex's dad,I recommend this movie to all fans of the trilogy.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Same old imagery-and its not working wonders,"Unfortunally just another animated ""family"" movie using African imagery as props. There is the usual self-adoring theme running through the movie that subtley demonizes the Other under the guise of colorful solidarity and happy friendship. Technical aspects or possibly some qualitative scenes that might move the audience does not make up for this overall sinister aspect of what the movie conveys. Sure, there where scenes that where somewhat funny but on another level it is not possible to feel joyful when there is a strong sense of something being off with the intention of the movie and the lack of artistic creativity and qenuine storytelling. Nothing I would feed the mind of future generations with! Children deserve so much more that this and they are so much smarter.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the Best Animated Movies i have ever seen....Maybe the Best,"Me, my friends, my family, everyone loved it. I've watched this movie over 100 times already on my DVD and i still don't get tired of it. Some critics out there are saying stuff like ""there's too much violence, not for the kids, etc."" Next they'll be saying ""i didn't like this movie coz it shows animals talking"". Its an animation movie guys, there's bound to be craziness in it. If violence was not suitable for kids, Cartoon Network would've been a network for adults only.If you have not seen this movie yet, SEE IT. And see the first one as well if u haven't seen that. And since its an animated movie, there's no need to use your brains. Just watch it for fun and you wont be disappointed.BTW The Penguins and King Julien Rule !!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Doesn't get better ... it's full of references to other films.,"This time Madagascar as a place is not present. The characters decide to go to Africa where they assume that with animals similar to them they will be happy. The protagonists, totally identified with their American rhythm of life, offer slight smiles with their gradual adjustment to the wild life. Unfortunately each protagonist becomes more and more unbearable despite once again having minor characters that bring joy to the film. It is with the penguins passing by Moto Moto or the old woman with a bad temper that we can find sparks of humor. References to the Lion King come out strongly as the film begins to tire in every way. Not improving in relation to the first one is a big problem.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Next  sequel for penguins !!!!!!!,"Madagascar 2 i really a fantastic movie compared to the original Madagascar. Here more credits goes to the penguins which steals most of the scenes. The lion and zebra played their role as usual. The role of old lady in the movie is bit fineThere are some unexpected scenes like shark in middle of Africa.It is not needed in the movie..But as usual like first part the movie ends with "" I like to move it"" song for end credits.Animation is superb and over all the movie is worth to watch in theater. i recommend every one to watch the movie if u want some week end fun....I give 8.5/10 for this movie",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
DISGUSTING,"This film is an absolute travesty, the first film was amazing and was a cinematic masterpiece. However I cannot say the same for this one. When I watched it I was disgusted by the awful plot. Such a downgrade from the first, very disappointing.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than the first,"This was one of the funniest films I've ever seen. When I see a Dreamworks film I expect a memorable, fun, crude, but a rather mediocre movie. This film was (very) memorable, fun, (very) crude but a high- quality movie.So, the film starts off with giving you a bit of background on how Alex got to the zoo in New York and then goes to the present where the animals you got to know and love in the first film (Alex, Gloria, Marty, Melman, the penguins, King Julien, Maurice, Mort, and the two monkeys) get ready to go to New York. Well, the end crash-landing in Africa and Alex meets his family and the others (outside of Julien and the penguins) find other animals of their kind.This film is charming like the original Madagascar. Alex meets his family and then he and his dad struggle to keep a good relationship. At the same time he struggles to keep friends with Marty. It's another film about struggling relationships. But, it's done in a rather fun and charming way.This film is a bit more inappropriate (ok, check that, a lot more inappropriate) than the first film. This one the sexual innuendo and a little close to sex scenes dominate the film, some more suggestive language, and a few scenes of animals beating up an elderly woman.Overall, it is definitely better, but more inappropriate than the first. Personally the absolute youngest age I'd allow a child to see it is 8. I give this film 8 stars out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A lot more depressing than I remembered,"My strongest memory of Madagascar 2 had to be the Moto Moto song ""I like them big! I like em chunky!"" It was probably the second most talked about thing on my elementary school playground about the Madagascar series; the first being ""I like to move it move it!"" naturally. I otherwise vaguely remembered enjoying Madagascar 2 when I was younger, remembering it as similar to the first movie only this time the characters are in Sub-Saharan Africa.But wow the movie itself was just a lot more depressing than I remembered! That's in part because the movie wanted to establish an internal conflict for each of the four main characters. In the first movie, there was some brief character conflict in the middle of the film against Alex and Marty, but it was resolved pretty fast so the regular plot could move on. It seems like in Madagascar 2, the main characters have a falling out with each other early on and it lasts a majority of the movie. And on top of that, there are several depressing conflicts including a kid getting separated by his family from hunters, a family being banished from a community (Lion King style), to even one of the characters being suicidal twice in the film (with a pretty dramatic intervention scene).There's just way too much conflict in this movie and only a small amount of payoff at the end. Had the characters been supportive of each other throughout the entire film, the conflicts wouldn't feel as depressing. Definitely not a bad concept for a sequel; I like that the main characters got to interact with more animals in the new setting. But the plot could have been executed better.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
The penguins need their own film!,"After two films and a Christmas Caper special, I am even more convinced that the Madagascar penguins (Skipper, Kowalski, Rico and Private) deserve their own film.These military trained penguins have many memorable quotes under their belt. Kowalski's conversations with Skipper and Private are always funny and witty. Rico is the mute psychotic demolition dude. One scene poked fun at how capitalism is making the working class angry without maternal leave.The old lady is (still) irritating. She should be removed in Madagascar 3.Mao points: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Exactly what I expected,"Madagascar 2 is really a very funny movie. This sequel is a step forward from the first one maybe because the story is more interesting and the plot is better developed. Also it is a non-stop laughing for an hour and a half with some very funny references from other movies. The cast of voices is great. Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith and David Schwimmer repeating their roles as Alex, Marty, Gloria and Melman are again so funny and amusing. Sasha Baron Cohen as king Julien is hilarious and the addition of Alec Baldwin, Bernie Mac and Will I Am as Makunga, Zuba and Moto Moto was excellent. In conclusion, Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is a very entertaining and enjoyable movie the whole family will enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Goofy and wonderful! Hilarious for adults!,"After seeing everything else at our rather slow moving and small multi-plex, I steeled myself for a dreadful 90 minutes in a cutsie-dootsie kiddies movie. Wrong! Despite the presence of two dozen toddlers in the auditorium (with their families, obviously), this was HILARIOUS! It was as adult, and bright, and funny, as any of the Shrek movies. Maybe Chris Rock playing a herd of zebras in this reminded me of Eddie Murphy in the Shreks (?). Truthfully, Madagascar 3 was that good.I suppose one doesn't have to be a genius to write one-liners and story lines that operate on two levels--- the kids' level, and the parents who brought them to the show. But maybe these writers are geniuses, I don't know. They certainly wrote some surprisingly sharp, witty, and adult jokes for the grown up portion of the audience. I have no idea what the toddlers experienced--- but in the time my showing was on, I never heard any crying, squawking, nor running up and down the aisles. Over the course of the 100-odd minutes (with trailers and whatnot) there were 5 or 6 dashes to the loo by a parent carrying or leading some youngster. Otherwise, no disturnbaces at all. The little ones seemed content.All of us in the audience roared with laughter OFTEN. That was both a surprise, as I said, and of course a delight.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better and funnier,"I was looking forward to Madagascar 2 after I heard a sequel was coming out. I thought the first one was great and one of my favorite's animated movies of all-time. When I saw Madagascar 2, I thought it was better and funnier than the first one.After being stranded in the shores of Madagascar, the New Yorkers plan an idea of repairing an old damaged plane on the island. The penguins somewhat repaired the plane thinking it's all perfect and done. Not long after taking off, the penguins notices the plane is having engines problems and tells the passengers (the New Yorkers and King Julian's people) on the air plane is going down. They land in the plains of Africa and Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria find themselves encountering their own kind and realizing this is where it all began.Most of the characters from the original return in the sequel, but the movie do have new ones as well. In the movie, Alex (Ben Stiller) meets his parents. Marty (Chris Rock), Melman (David Schwimmer) and Gloria (Jadan Pinkett Smith) meet new friends also. The Penguins are great once again and we also meet monkeys as well. They were pretty funny to say the least.I thought the movie was hilarious and funnier than Madagascar. In the first film, King Julian stole the show, but in Escape 2 Africa, I thought the old lady with glasses took that spot. I was surprised her character was brought back in the sequel. And like I said before, the penguins are awesome and I would love to see them in Antarctica in the next movie.Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is a great family movie and it didn't disappoint. I thought the movie had a deeper story than the original and was definitely better too. If you enjoy Madagascar, then I think Escape 2 Africa is worth the watch. I am looking forward to Madagascar 3 on 2012.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Same Magnificence,"Similarly to the first movie, this sequel comes armed with a great story and amazing plot, bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Flawless fun in Africa,"What can I say, I'm stunned. It's that good.The creators of Madagascar use computer animation to boldly take slapstick to the next level. How 'bout duking it out with a nice old lady? Hey, let's run her over with a car! Something you'd expect to happen maybe in an ultra-gory mafia movie, but here it's fun for the entire family. But she rebounds Terminator-style, so don't worry, ma, it's only pixels.You could watch this movie scene-by-scene and it'd still be great fun. Those penguins are amazing. Rico ... manual!!! I like Skipper best of all (with Private, Kowalski and Rico a close second), and he's voiced by Tom McGrath, who's actually moonlighting as a sync actor but the movie's director in the real life. No mean feat. There's a cute lost son story for the kids, and lots of slick, crass urban fun for the adults.This is the Blues Brothers for the 21. century. I'll bet this'll go classic!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Pretty enjoyable, just as the first one...","Surprisingly, I enjoyed 'Madagascar' and was looking forward to the sequel. All in all, it's more of the same; about as much as you can expect from animated films, but its still enjoyable nonetheless. The penguins are an absolute riot, and were my favorite characters hands down, along with Julian. Solid 'storylines' with the four main characters but, again, its nothing really different. It was nice touch to see them finally come in touch with their 'roots', as Chris Rock's character hilariously put it. There was also pretty good humor throughout, just as there was in the original. Everything is executed well and makes for another enjoyable adventure. Not sure if a sequel is needed; if there are indeed serious talks about making one...because everything has been pretty much resolved with this one.*** out of **** stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than the first one,"The first one was funny but the is even funnier. The animation is better too. It's much smoother than the first one. Alex(Ben Stiller) reunited with his parents(Bernie Mac) after a lifelong separation but his reunion's cut short by a few cultural misunderstandings and his father's rival(Alec Baldwin) who's determined to take the throne from underneath his feet.If that's not enough, he has to deal with the old lady who pummeled him in the first movie. His friends meanwhile, face their own problems as well. From conflicting emotions about each other to culture shock. Needless to say you're in a for a wild ride.The writing's much better. The gags are more hilarious and can still get a laugh even after they've passed. The interactions between the characters feel more natural. You can really see and feel the camaraderie between them. The old lady also gets some food laughs too. As a cillian, she's not really evil just a survivor who comes into conflict with the main cast(mostly Alex and the Penguin who are also a trip in the movie as always) They did grow up together after all. Their reactions the longer they stay in Africa is pretty funny/interesting. It's interesting to say how they adapt to their new environment often with hilarious results.So yeah, this's a good sequel. It does what few do: Further the plot, characters and setting. It may not be perfect but it's a huge improvement over the first. With that being said, hop on in and take a trip to Africa where you may discover a wild side of your own.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One Amazing Film,I never get tired of watching this film. My favorite part is the zebra part where Marty mixes in with the herd. It is nice to see him in his element.

Fantastic.,"This was a brilliant film to take the kids to watch, my little brother laughed all the way through, this is how i gave this film so many starts in the rating system because the plot line isn't just funny for adults who are writing these kind of reviews, it is also understandable for little kids, you don't have to sit there and explain what is going on ALL the way through the film!! In comparison to Madagascar 1, i think that the first one was a lot better, but don't let you put you off, because the sequel was still enjoyable. I have given it 8/10 because if feel it was very funny, but the plot line was a bit boring ""unblock a dam"" :SI have seen it in the cinema, but if i would have seen it at home i don't think it would be so enjoyable.And with remarks to the other comment......the penguins SO need a new film, they are why i went to see it. ha-haJ",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Better story, better characters, better jokes equals a better movie.","It's a rare thing to see a sequel to an animated comedy that is way better than its predecessor, but that is the case with Madagascar.It starts off where the first movie ended and let's us see these characters end up in Africa where they discover things about themselves that changes their lives in different ways either by learning about their past, the present or where the future will bring them. That added some welcomed depth to them which was scarce in the first movie.But it's not just our main characters who get turned into something interesting in this swequel, because even minor characters from the first movie get their own sub-plot which is mostly meant to be entertainment, but it actually works and does not feel shoe-horned in or takes focus away from the main plot.And I laughed so much more and way harder to the humour in this than in its predecessor, so I dare say that Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa is better than it's predecessor in every way",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Woo Hoo for Mad 2!!!,"I went to see Madagascar 2 over the weekend with my nephew and we both thought it was a riot!! It was such a fun and entertaining movie. I had seen the original and loved it and was totally jazzed to see how good the sequel was. My nephew had never seen the first one but he was totally able to understand and get into this one. I love ALL the characters but my favorites were the hippos, the penguins, the monkeys and that meerkat. The animation is awesome, the plot is fun and comical and it was just a fun movie. I can't wait to either see it again with my other nephew or buy it on DVD and watch it 20 times. It has that kind of appeal...to laugh and dance and enjoy it over and over.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A surprisingly good sequel,"This is the best animated sequel I've seen in ages... Wait, let me re-phrase that. This is not quite the best animated sequel I've seen in ages, but it is so good that it almost is better than the original film for me and usually I prefer the first films to the seconds films. The only reason I prefer the original film to this is because there are no New York City scenes here. In ""Madagasgar"", the New York City scenes were very much a highlight, very realistic to the actual places. In many places I find this sequel funnier than the original, there are some very good one-liners here and a few slapstick jokes which are marginally good as well. In this sequel the personalities of all the main characters in the last film are properly revealed and makes them more likable as characters. They were all very good and entertaining and likable in the first film, but here you get to see their ""inner"" feelings and all that jazz.This film starts with a father lion in the middle of the African savannah teaching his very young and very cute cub the ways of being a leader and he hopes that one day this little cub will take over the pride. However, the cub is all play and dance, something which slightly disappoints the father lion. Just then, an enemy lion comes to challenge the adult lion and they battle - leaving the cub unsupervised... He is captured by humans and eventually arrives in New York City zoo. Yes, the cub is Alex!To see and enjoy this film you must really watch ""Madagasgar"", the first film. If you watch this first, then you are probably going to be incredibly confused and it is not worth seeing this.I recommend this great film to everyone who enjoyed the first film, to everyone who loves Africa in computer animation and to people who enjoyed the humour of the last film. Enjoy ""Madagasgar 2""! :-)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good laughter and adventure,"""Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa delivers another round of laughter and adventure with our favorite quartet of friends. The story takes a new twist as they find themselves stranded in Africa, discovering their roots and facing unexpected challenges along the way.The supporting cast, particularly the scene-stealing penguins, adds layers of humor and charm to the film. Their antics keep the audience entertained from start to finish, leaving us eagerly anticipating their own spin-off.Visually, the film immerses us in the vibrant landscapes of Africa, showcasing impressive visual effects that bring the wild animals and breathtaking scenery to life. The infectious energy of the theme song, 'Move It,' adds to the overall enjoyment, making you want to dance along with the characters.Beyond the laughter, Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa touches on themes of love and belonging, reminding us that these bonds transcend boundaries. While it may not reach the heights of its predecessor, this sequel still delivers plenty of laughs and heartwarming moments, making it a worthwhile watch for audiences of all ages.""",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The First One is Better....The Second is Still Good!,"I enjoyed watching Madagascar. That movie was funny and original. That made me look forward to the second movie. I thought that the sequel would be better, but I was somewhat let down.

The animals join up with a wild herd with hilarious results. Alex even get to see his parents again.The characters in this movie are funny. The penguins are still the best. Alex and Gloria still did great. I was slightly disappointed Marty. I liked him better in the first film.

Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,"""Oh I like Laughing is such a nice experience to laugh"" king Julien said. It sure did after watching Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa. This 89 minutes animated movie was released on November 07, 2008. Etan Cohen wrote the movie full of laughs and joy. Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath directed the movie. The dancing lion ""Alex "" was voiced by Ben Stiller, and his best friend the zebra ""Marty"" was done by Chris Rock. David Schwimmer voiced the giraffe ""Melman"", and Jada Pinkett Smith voiced the hippopotamus ""Gloria"". The film starts showing us a small part of Alex's early life playing with his father ""Zuba"". Then they show us how the hunters captured him. After watching this small part of Alex's childhood life, the story of getting out of Madagascar begins with a plane that would take them to New York City. Soon after taking off, the penguin crew announced a sudden landing or crash landing as they said. They crash landed in Africa, where each of the central characters meets others of the same species; and most importantly Alex is reunited with his parents. Water problems come up and lion thrown issues appeared. This is where the story really starts to get more interesting. In addition to the four main characters, King Julien voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen adds more fun to this movie along with the penguins. These additional characters I believe it boosted the enjoyment of this movie. The smart criminal minded penguins and hilarious king Julien took it to a new level of entertainment. Moreover, I found the idea is very smart move when they brought back the old lady character ""Nana."" This old lady appeared in one shot on the previous Madagascar. She was the one who beat Alex in grand central station. She returns as a member of tourist group on safari. I liked how the writer builds up this character. I liked this strong old lady who doesn't get afraid of everything. Another strong element that enhanced this movie is the music. Hans Zimmer and will.i.am did a great job in composing. At the end, I can't wait to see the next Madagascar. I would be the first person in line to watch it. For those who didn't watch Madagascar, I would say to them you missed a lot. A movie full of laughs is worth seeing!",,Anonymous,Animation
