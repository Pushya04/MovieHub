Let the child in you enjoy this adventure,"Cute movie. Has a couple of great messages -- especially one about prejudices. There are some adult jokes, some childish jokes, lots of laugh out loud moments but most importantly the following messages: Hatred against those we don't know is wrong; Let yourself get to know a person before deciding whether they are good or not; and go along for the ride and let yourself enjoy life.I also love the fact that this is a Dad raising his child situation. There are really few movies that show a Dad can step up and do the right thing for their children if given the chance.While I didn't particularly care for the fart joke or some of the childish parts the kids in the theater laughed and laughed.Well done!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Count me among those who thought the movie was surprisingly good,"After reading reviews that either disliked or were indifferent to Hotel Transylvania and being dubious because Adam Sandler(who has been in a lot of really bad movies recently) was in the lead role, I was unsure of whether to see the film. But my love for animation and the appetising trailer over-rode my doubts and I saw it anyway. And you know what, while The Pirates and ParaNorman were better animated movies from this year in my opinion I found Hotel Transylvania much better than expected. More could have been done with the relationship between Jonathan and Mavis, it is a romantic angle that has been used many times before and as well as feeling somewhat under-baked very little new was done with it. While a vast majority of the film is fast-paced with no real dull spots, some parts of the film did feel rushed. On the other point of view, the animation is excellent, the backgrounds are both beautiful and Gothic and that is the same with the colours. The characters are well-modelled. The soundtrack is catchy and upbeat, though some of the songs could have been more than just snippets. The writing is zany and often witty with a surprising amount of heart also.The story is predictable, but not dull. It has a number of great moments, the genre references are not as inspired as they were in ParaNorman but they are fun to spot, and I loved a lot of the slapstick-in-style gags. Especially the zombie Beethoven, the scream cheese Hors-D'Oeuvres, the shrunken heads do not disturb tags and the digs at Twilight(much more fulfilling than any of the movies combined). But it does have a lot of heart. Is the over-protective father idea clichéd? Of course. But I did find it genuinely touching instead of overly-exaggerated as I have seen described. Dracula's past is also shown in a darkly emotional way. The characters are not the most memorable I have ever seen, but they do have their likability, my favourite here was Dracula. And the voice acting was surprisingly great, to me from a non-fan who has liked him in some movies(Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, Spanglish and Happy Gilmore) and hated him in others(Jack and Jill, Going Overboard, Zookeeper and Mr Deeds) Adam Sandler gives one of his better performances of late in the role of Dracula, he is actually funny as well as emotive in alternative to irritating. Selena Gomez is endearing as daughter Mavis and Adam Samberg brings some heroism to Jonathan. Kevin James, David Spade, Jon Lovitz, Fran Drescher and especially Steve Buscemi give solid support. In conclusion, surprisingly good. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Far exceeded my expectations!,"I went into this movie really with no expectations. I had only seen a few fragments of commercials and got nothing at all interesting from them. So, WOW, was I surprised and impressed when I saw it!! The movie was a creative story, quick moving action, funny, heartwarming, visually interesting and sometimes surprising - this film had a lot of great things going on, and I found myself really engaged and far more interested in the characters than I would have guessed. Sure, there were a few ""as if"" moments, but for the most part I found it to be fun, funny, and a film I heartily recommend! Kudos to the writers, voice actors and animators.... With a youngster in my home, I'm sure we'll be seeing this again soon.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Solid Family Entertainment,"..took my family to see this one today, 6 year old son, 3 year old daughter..Both of them really enjoyed the experience, though to be honest i think my daughter connected with the movie more because of the plight of Dracula's young daughter being the focal point of the story. That really surprised me!Any horror fan with kids will get a real kick out of this one. And even non-horror fans should find the story cute. Sandler and company really pull it together for this one, after their last couple of films were less then stellar.Definitely a pleasant surprise, and good fun for the whole family.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Some jokes are forced, but an overall enjoyable film!","Hotel Transylvania stars: Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kevin James and David Spade. It goes for approximately 90 minutes. It fails to deliver GREAT 3D moments although some could be classified as 'GOOD'.The first half of the movie is what is called 'Jokes Are Failing' Syndrome. Although they do crack in a couple of good laughs in the first half, majority don't live up to expectations that animations nowadays do. Too many slapstick moments and unnecessary forced jokes... NOTE TO FILM-MAKERS: If jokes are forced... Don't even bother with the joke!The movie has heart though, which kind of makes for it's first half. The second half however is fun, cool, funny and surprisingly a bit thrilling! It does have it's fun moments... I will admit. Although some of the 3D doesn't work I still found it to be a good animation... Is it the best animation of the year? NO WAY! But is it great as an animation? No, not really it is what I call 'A good animation if you just let your mind do nothing!' A B from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A very un-unique animation which is still surprisingly good in its own way,"When 'Hotel Transylvania' first came out, I had absolutely no intention of seeing it for two reasons: Adam Sandler and vampires. I thought a comedy about Dracula would be boring. This movie isn't that bad but at the same time isn't that funny In this movie, we have Count Dracula who has organized a building called Hotel Transylvania to keep his fellow monsters safe from the evil humans. Now, doesn't that sound familiar? From a Pixar movie? MONSTERS INC! One day, a human accidentally ventures into the monster world...Hmm...Still familiar and meets Dracula's daughter, Mavis voiced by Selena Gomez and falls in love...Still remind me of the Sully and Boo relationship as well as segments of Twilight.I'll start off by saying that voice acting is brilliant. Adam Sandler really was great as Count Dracula, Adam Samberg was great as Johnny and Kevin James was a great Frankenstein. Selena Gomez also did a great job. The story however isn't anything special by any means. Too much of the story is from Monsters Inc but there are parts of Twilight in this movie which I love as a lot of it is indirectly mocking that god-awful series. The characters are funny but by no means any memorable. The dialogue is actually the movie's greatest strength. It really is hilarious in so many ways. There are so many one liners and Johnny's line ""Wow man! Your Dracula impression is way over the top!"" is simply hilarious as is the woman with the annoying voice saying to the monster in the kitchen ""Your voice is annoying"" If it weren't for the dialogue, this movie could so easily be horrible. The visual animations in the movie are stunning with each scene being carefully visualised and is truly a treat for the eye.The film's main problem is its very close resemblance to Monsters Inc which makes the movie nothing unique. However, the mocking of Twilight is handled very well, the animations are superb, the characters and voice acting are done well and is well directed but a bit rushed at certain points during the film. The film could also have been a good ten minutes shorter and we wouldn't have missed anything funny or special. Overall, a good animation movie which isn't unique but funny",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very enjoyable experience,"I gave this a complete 10 because both the wife and I (as well as the other movie-goers -going by their reactions) thoroughly enjoyed it from the beginning to the very end.Was it predictable? Of course. Its an animation geared towards children (what would you expect?) -but like most of the animation movies of today, there were quite a few 'hidden humor' spots as well which would be completely missed by the younger audience (not unexpected since it is the adults, after all, who are forking over the bread and it doesn't hurt to keep THEM entertained as well). The movie is fairly fast-paced and the animation well done. I'm usually a little apprehensive when I've harbored good expectations from a movie based on clips/previews, but in this case I felt it truly delivered. This one will be added to our library when it (eventually) hits the shelves. Too many people look for a great amount of depth and unpredictability in animation movies -but THAT is a bit unrealistic (no pun intended) -think about it: These things USED to be called CARTOON MOVIES for a reason. They weren't intended to fit that kind of expectation. They ARE intended to be fun -and this movie is just that: FUN.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fresh family fun! - Pretty Good,"I did not know this movie was directed by Tartakovsky, which is probably why I liked it as much as I did. He is one of my favorite animation directors and he does a great job in directing this movie as well. The humor is a bit hit or miss, mostly kid-oriented but there were some creative jokes and I laughed out loud a couple times. The cast does a good job for the most part and the movie has some heart to it. Overall, a pretty pleasant surprise that could have benefited from some better writing.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best (funniest) animations I've seen in years!,I went to see Hotel Transylvania last night in a small group of adults aged 24-30 and I LMAO as did the others. The theater was packed with little children who mostly laughed at not really funny parts and adults who laughed when the children were quite silent. The story is about Count Dracule trying to raise his only child safe and sound away from terrifying humans and invites all the monsters to his hotel to relax and celebrate his very young daughter's 118th birthday which is accompanied by a surprise visitor!This is a really funny movie with a simple predictable story line and tons of characters that you will love. My favorites were the zombies who were the hotel staff and it took them forever to finish a task. I recommend this movie to anyone who like monsters ( so afraid of a little boy licking ice-cream)and want to have a good laugh and take a break from Disney.,9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Adorable Family Film,"The, I think, is a movie that is fun for the whole family. Youngsters will like the characters, the older children will enjoy the jokes and plot, and the adults will likely enjoy the movie as well, being able to catch on to the more ""adult"" funny references and a story about a father-daughter relationship that can be appreciated.The movie is fairly fast paced, but most cartoons are, especially ones that are just 91 minutes long. If you're planning to take your 3 year old to appreciate the plot, connect with the characters, and understand the meaning of family and love... that's not happening... it is a children's movie but it's not Sesame Street.My husband and I took our 2 1/2 year old because it seemed like a cute movie to watch. It was. Our son sat through the entire movie and danced with the music, etc. We enjoyed it as well.Was it EXTRAORDINARY? No. Was it a good, fun family film? Yes.I would recommend it. If you're unsure about paying for a ticket at the theater, you can always wait for the DVD to come out.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Classic characters lovingly re-imagined with rubbery animation.,"The standard themes of familial acceptance, 'leaving the nest' and putting the needs of others above those of your own are told surprisingly well through suitably rubbery animation, ostensibly ham-fisted voice-work and lovably re-crafted classic characters. 'Hotel Transylvania (2012)' is generally generic but consistently pretty fun, and at times actually funny, to the point where I don't mind the fact I've essentially seen it all before. It's clearly Adam Sandler's best work for quite a bit. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Monsters Going Wild,"Hotel Transylvania has a simple concept: classic campy monsters staying in a hotel where humans are not allowed because they think we're evil. It doesn't sound too fresh but it looks fun. Behind this concept is a father-daughter-relationship that seems to follow the footsteps of other great recent animated films. The result is, it's not getting there yet but it's still as delightful as it's suppose to be. It's one of those films that it's so crazy, you'll instantly like it. Most of the gags are clever and ridiculous. Overall, it's an endless fun entertainment.Though, the film sometimes feels like a mediocre animated kids film. Generic family film elements are there but they are used in a different way. There is often slapstick and toilet humor but the gags are best when it's outrageously absurd. Every set pieces are swift, quirky, and exciting. The voices of the characters sound silly at glance but the actors made them pretty likable.When the craziness slows down, there's a sweet bit of Dracula's relationship between Mavis and Jonathan, and some brooding. The drama is a little effective. It's not as strong as most recent animated films. It's more focused at being fun and hilarious. It's great when it stays to the roots of a cartoon like showing peculiar looking characters acting like lunatics. The best laughs are when the monsters are expressing their misanthropy in a ludicrously paranoid way, and when they're just making fun of each other. Mainstream pop culture song numbers kind of tone things down, but the song number at the end didn't affect the breathtaking and emotional climax.Hotel Transylvania is good enough for the whole family even though it's raucous. Fans of the animation genre would enjoy this a lot more. Since it's directed by a cartoon expert, it contains a lot of absurd and exciting scenes that is similar to his shows. Although, some might expect something more since many animated films these days are deeper and powerful, leaving the old habits behind. Hotel Transylvania still has the heart but it's just not as compelling as the others. If you're in for the joys then this will give you a good time. My rating may be too high, but this my thing. I always enjoy this kind of animation.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Obnoxious dude-isms,"I don't know if Sandler helped sink this by mere association or what. The humor is broad. The message against prejudice is as heavyhanded as in Brave, but simply blurted out to us. The computer animation is typical, nothing to see—both horror-themed stop motion films of this year trump it with ease. The horror sketchbook feel is much better captured in Frankenweenie, by a filmmaker who actually loves the stuff. ParaNorman has the fancy characters and dazzle for the kids, but offers us a richer, more visual experience on the same subject.By contrast to those other films that show creators immersed in at least some aspect of their work, this gives the feel of a mass-marketed product—never more obvious than in the songs performed, ranging from punk rock to club music.The logic here is something for everyone.",,Anonymous,Animation
"A Traditional Father/Daughter Story, Only Their Vampires!","Every father of a daughter has wished at some point in his life to keep his little girl well protected from the world and the wrong guys in a remote castle in the middle of nowhere for 118 years. ""Hotel Transylvania"" is an animated feature about a father, who happens to be Dracula, voiced by Adam Sandler, who does exactly that to his daughter Mavis, voiced by Selena Gomez.The story begins in the year 1895 where Dracula is unexpectedly forced to be a single father and raise his baby girl Mavis after a tragedy takes his wife's life. He builds a huge castle for Mavis and turns it into a hotel for monsters. His intentions is to make it a refuge for monsters (insects included) where no humans are allowed. Flash forward to the current year, it is the eve of Mavis 118th birthday. It seems to be the equivalent to a human teenager's 18th birthday. Mavis quickly reminds Dracula that his promise to her on her 118th birthday is that she would get to finally explore the world outside of the castle and even travel to a different country.Not wanting to disappoint his little girl, he allows her to visit a small village just outside of the castle that same night. However, it turns out that the village is not real. It is made of multiple facades with Dracula's zombie workers disguised as humans who scare Mavis away by using fire and threatening to kill her.Her curiosity of humans is put to rest by the experience. But, when she meets a mystery young male drifter named Jonathan who stumbles into the hotel claiming the identity of a party planner for her birthday who is Frankenstein's cousin – John Stein, Mavis feels a certain ""zing"" with him that she just can't shake. At the end, his true identity is revealed in the worst way – under the scrutiny of the hotel's monster guests as well as Mavis who is hurt by her Father's betrayal but is fascinated even more by Jonathan. However, upon Dracula's wishes Jonathan exits the hotel to continue his travels. Dracula says, ""I want to kill him. But it would set monsters back hundreds of years"".""Hotel Transylvania"" is a movie that parents will genuinely enjoy with their children. Though having some plot holes, such as even though Dracula stated early in the movie that he too has kept himself from the outside world away from humans for over 100 years, yet he knows what the word ""nerd"" means and recognizes the movie ""Twilight"" when he sees it. Dracula clears up a few misconceptions about vampires – MORE: http://hllywdjnkt.co/QtQNfLHollywoodJunket.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Quite Funny,"Dracula, who operates a high-end resort away from the human world, goes into overprotective mode when a boy discovers the resort and falls for the count's teen-aged daughter.As far as plots go, this one is pretty simple and not all that deep or clever. The characters are also not that deep. Often, this will take away from a film (or completely ruin it, like it did for ""The Good Dinosaur""). But this was also a very funny movie, and that more than made up for it.I confess that I was hesitant about it being a film coming out of the ""Adam Sandler camp"". It seems Sandler has more misses than hits these days, but this was clearly a hit. Funny for both adults and children, great use of characters to drive the humor home. I wasn't super-crazy about Andy Samberg's character (who sounded like Steve Zahn), but it wasn't a deal-breaker.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I loved this movie!,"Everyone remembers that special movie they saw or that one that was the best for your mind, that one which really stuck. For me that movie was ""Hotel Transylvania"". I think it was one of the best children's movie ever made. It conveys humor, creativity, action and freedom.Set in Transylvania in modern time, Dracula (Adam Sandler) hosts all the legendary monsters at his hotel to celebrate his daughter's one hundred and eighteenth birthday. But he works overtime to keep Mavis (Selena Gomez) from falling for a human boy named Johnny (Andy Samberg), who miraculously stumbles upon the hotel. All Mavis has ever wanted is to leave home and see the real world and see if humans are as bad as her father says they are. The main characters are Selena Gomez as Mavis, Andy Samberg as Johnny and Adam Sandler as Dracula. It is a brilliant cast for this movie.Selena Gomez was perfect for the part of Mavis and did a great job while Andy Samberg was good but wasn't perfect for Johnny. I think he could've done a much better job. Adam Sandler was born to play the part of Dracula. He did a magnificent job and was extremely humorous. The other characters were great and they matched their roles perfectly!I liked that we got to know the characters and what their goal was. For example Mavis wanted freedom and wanted to leave home. What I didn't like is that it was a bit confusing. For example, ""Why was Johnny hiking in Transylvania at night?"" or ""Why didn't Mavis just turn in to a bat and fly away to see the real world?"" These questions make you wonder but I still think it was a wonderful movie even for my age group.I think the moral of the story was trust your children to make the right decisions no matter what you think about them and from the child point of view the moral was to know your parents are always just trying to protect you. And both are true and if you look at them from both sides you will get the full story. I think that this is a movie for age groups above five and below fifteen. Reason being because Dracula does a fang up where his face goes a bit creepy but other wise I'm sure parents will love it and children between the ages of five and fifteen will love it to.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
And I Thought The Monster Squad was Childish,"I'm sure plenty of children and families adore ""Hotel Transylvania,"" but not every animated kiddie movie is without intelligence, so I'm not going to cut it any slack. Another animated monster kids movie, Pixar's ""Monster's, Inc."" (2001), for instance, is kind of clever in its use of doors to multiple universes. And, although not animated, ""The Monster Squad"" (1987) manages to pay homage to classic monster movies and remain charming despite some childish humor. ""Hotel Transylvania"" features many of the same monsters as that film and more, including Dracula and his daughter, Frankenstein and his bride, werewolves, mummies, an invisible man, a gillman and Quasimodo, but they've basically nothing to do with their sources in novels or prior movies. They're more akin to the monster cereals, such as Count Chocula and Frenken Berry--mere caricatures, overly sweet and not very good for you.In ""Hotel Transylvania,"" Dracula has clipped the wings, so to speak, of his bat daughter, but he must learn to allow her to fly the coop. He also runs a hotel for monsters. The Dracula of ""Nocturna"" (1979) did the same thing, the film also had plenty of music like this one (except it was disco), and Dracula's daughter fell in love with a human. The similarities stop there, though, since ""Nocturna"" also had gratuitous nudity and an old Dracula complaining about how his reproductive organs don't work as well anymore (although, here, the Invisible Man defends the size of his in one pool-side gag). ""Hotel Transylvania,"" on the other hand, has Count-less butt jokes, including a fart that's let on fire. I'm not sure which is worse, but I know fire is bad.There's a joke at the expense of the ""Twilight"" series, where Dracula sardonically remarks, ""This is how we're represented."" Right back at you, Count Chocula; ""Hotel Transylvania"" isn't fang-tastic, either. Nor had I ever heard Dracula say ""blah blah blah,"" and I've seen well over 50 Dracula movies since reading Bram Stoker's novel. Perhaps, the worst caricature of all, though, is Quasimodo as the hotel chef. Why is he a chef? Because he's French, I guess. That's racist. Anyways, the movie wraps up like a bad rom-com but replaces the father for the girl or boy chasing down the other for a grand romantic gesture. It's kind of like ""The Wedding Singer"" (1998) and with the same actor.Another quibble I have with this movie is that when they list off Dracula's vulnerabilities--sunlight, garlic, stakes to the heart--they don't mention crosses. I get that they threw out all of the sex and violence from Dracula--even though that was most of Stoker's book--it's a kid's movie, after all. But the religion? I think that was a shrewd commercial move to avoid offending any audience, except for maybe cranky old Dracula buffs like me. But, they've made millions of dollars off this franchise and, as of this writing, about to release the third movie installment, so they know what they're doing. I don't have to like it, though.(Mirror Note: No mirror shots in this Dracula movie, either.)",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's good but nothing too memorable,"Dracula (Adam Sandler) opens a hotel for only monsters serving as an oasis away from the humans. His daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) has grown up in the hotel for 118 years not knowing any humans other than the unreal scary stories told by her father. She is still itching to go out and explore the human world. One day, human backpacker Jonathan (Andy Samberg) stumbles onto the hotel throwing Dracula's world upside down.It's good to see people other than Pixar doing good animation. This one has a good story to serve as a solid base. The monsters have real humanity. The ending is somewhat undramatic. The singalong number at the end flattens any climax it had. It's unlikely they created any breakthrought characters that could lead to a sequel but it's still a good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A funny animation but with little heart,"Rating-6/10Hotel Transylvania is an animated movie that has laughs, a nice style and some good people involved in the voice cast. Now the film is only OK and really isn't good or more nevertheless it is fun and should entertain the majority who view it. There are many good jokes and although a lot are physical jokes, it plays well and some really can get you going with stomach hurting laughter.I felt it was written well and is the basis of the funny business in all fairness, and although not being the tightest of scripts, still the jokes come across thick and fast. As I said before the film has a lot of laughs but the writing does lack depth and although will please in my opinion, it won't be a totally memorable experience, especially for parents maybe watching with kids.Another thing that maybe the script does or that the director does it give the film very little heart, maybe even none at all. It isn't sweet and even at times it can try,but it still falls flat on it's face. The problem they have in that area does hinder it quite a bit and also a massive reason this won't be remembered as much as other animated films, and although still OK on my account, no more than that.The voice cast as I mentioned are good and Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez and others are well cast with humour flowing through there voice pretty well. I have to say after a little while you do start to forget who the cast actually are with people such as Sandler becoming a forgetful after thought which helps in the humour as you actually laugh at him. I also liked the voice of Steve Buscemi who voices Wayne the werewolf and he is very funny and the basis of many funny moments.The animated style is nice, it isn't quite what I would call the top notch kind of animation but it is still really quite nice. I found the movement is well done and although the movie is very very fast and characters kind of hit the wall, literally, it still looks very nice. I also really loved the sets involved and yet again they look very nicely done, I think with the addition of director Genndy Tartakovsky who himself is also an animator, you get a good team to sort out the way it looks.I think with this movie anyone can watch it, not only the kids but also the adults and even though I have seen some people say this strictly for kids, I don't believe they are right and it fine enough for anyone. Don't expect it to be unfunny seriously, I went in thinking maybe this will be very poor but in truth as I have said it is OK, so lets move on to my conclusion.So overall the length of the movie is good at a steady time of 91 minutes, it fits in everything it needs too and doesn't over do it either. I think also overall, as I have mentioned a million times already, it is funny, and funny enough to be OK and well worth a watch from anyone who really wants to see a good animation with a nice style and quite a few good laughs too.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worth spending the night in,"Every once in a while i'm in the mood for some animated fun. You don't have to expect a lot from most animation movies but a lot of 'em are solid fun. So is Hotel Transylvania. Kids like monsters. Especially overactive ones. That's exactly what this movie is. An overactive stay in a hotel for monsters. No humans allowed! The story is simple and predictable. Also the all-star cast isn't necessary. Mostly because the strength isn't the voice acting. It's the animations, the fun and kinda dumb characters and the tempo which makes the movie fun to watch. You won't get bored nor surprised by this movie. But whether you're 51 or 8, you'll definitely have a good laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Hotel Transylvania Review,"When monsters want to go on vacation, they turn to Count Dracula's (Adam Sandler) Hotel Transylvania, a luxurious castle resort where they can simply be themselves without the possibility of being bothered by humans. For one special weekend, Dracula invites some of his creature friends: The Invisible Man (David Spade), The Mummy (CeeLo Green) among others to celebrate the 118th birthday of his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez). Things do not go according to plan when a human named Jonathan (Andy Samberg) manages to crash Dracula's party and then begins to fall in love with Mavis.Since I plan on seeing Hotel Transylvania 2 tomorrow, I thought I would first look at Hotel Transylvania. Adam Sandler has not had too many good movies this millennium. Most of them are just bad, stupid comedies. This one is a little stupid but I wouldn't call it bad. This is an animated kids movie so I wasn't expecting highbow or too deep. I thought it did its job with what it was trying to do. The animation isn't groundbreaking to say the least but I thought it was decent. The monsters all looked the way they were supposed to and their powers and abilities were well done as well. I can't speak too much more about that seeing that the theatrical version was in 3D and had more bells and whistles and I just saw it on Netflix. I also thought that the voice-over work was pretty good all around. Adam Sandler was great as Dracula and had some funny moments and some good one liners while also having great chemistry with the other characters. He was supposed to be Dracula but he was really just another Adam Sandler character but I didn't mind. What was also odd was the french accent Jon Lovitz used as Quasimodo. Being that this is an Adam Sandler film, the other characters are voiced by actors who have previously worked with Sandler in other films. The film did have other funny moments not involving Adam Sandler as most of its comedy comes from its portrayal of all the different monsters and their interactions with Dracula and one another. Most of the jokes were childish but I still found them funny. Underneath all of that is just a story about a father-daughter relationship where the father is just trying to raise his daughter and wanting what is best for her and trying to keep her safe. There's also a good message on stereotypes and prejudice. Sure the story may be a little cliché but it is just so damn cute.Score: 7/10 keithlovesmovies.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

When the party is ready to start, the 21-year-old Jonathan is walking through the forest and stumbles at the hotel. Dracula sees Jonathan and disguises him as a monster to hide Jonathan from his guests. But Mavis also sees Jonathan and Dracula forces him to pose of a monster. Soon Mavis believes that Jonathan is the ""zing"" of her life despite the advices of her father about the humans.""Hotel Transylvania"" is a delightful animation and a wonderful family entertaining for adults and children. The plot has a great message against prejudice and racism and the funny story made me laugh a lot with the gags.

"the story has been done before, but I really liked the animation","The best thing this movie has going for it is the animation. I thought it was really good, not as good as Pixir, but good. The story is a little dated, protective dad wants to keep daughter away from the world and from meeting a guy. Most of the time a princess is involved, but this movie using vampires. Yes, more vampires. So Dracula wants to keep his daughter Mavis from leaving his castle and meeting humans. In order to do this, he builds and fake town and using zombies to act as humans to scare her back. Also, he is throwing a birthday party for her and all his monster friends are at the castle. Then an uninvited guest shows up, Jonathan, a human. So Drac has to do all these funny things to keep the other monsters from noticing that Jonathan is human. All the while, Mavis is enjoying Jonathan's company and hearing about his travels.

A monster of animated fun,"Hotel Transylvania, if anything, is a surprisingly fun family film that works on many different levels. Sure, it's not the greatest thing to ever come out of monster cinema, but if you're a monster fan yourself and if you have kids, it's one heck of a fun ride.What's the story? When monsters want to get away from it all, they go to Count Dracula's Hotel Transylvania, a lavish resort where they can be themselves without humans around to bother them. On one special weekend, Dracula invites creatures like the Invisible Man, the Mummy and others to celebrate the 118th birthday of his daughter, Mavis. However, an unforeseen complication unfolds when an ordinary human unwittingly crashes the party and falls in love with Mavis.First, let's talk about Adam Sandler's performance as Dracula. I think he does a great job at the character, and if you hate Adam Sandler's work, don't worry! Dracula doesn't even SOUND like Sandler in this film! He also suits the Dracula character very well with a more comedic-style vampire voice going with the more cartoonish personality of the character. Sure, it's not Nosferatu or Interview with the Vampire level-good style of Dracula, but at the same time, I don't really think that's the intention. Selena Gomez does okay as Mavis, but I feel like the performance could be a bit better. The animation, while zany and out of control, still looks nice, especially with the effects, the backgrounds, and the designs of the monsters. Maybe the character animation isn't the best, but at least it does fit the cartoonish nature of the film. The story seems like a combination of Tangled and Monsters, Inc., but at least the concept of Dracula running a hotel for monsters does sound quite interesting to say the least. Maybe it would've worked better if it was an animated series (even if the Hotel Transylvania show sucks), but I'm fine with what it has to offer.In conclusion, Hotel Transylvania is hilarious, cute, energetic, and a lot of fun. It has nice animation, good performances, and an interesting concept, even if the quality of the writing is very poor. Ignore the bad stuff and feel good about the good stuff. If you're a Dracula fan- scratch that, if you're a monster fan- you're gonna LOVE Hotel Transylvania. It's an enjoyable film I think the whole family should watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good idea, but not executed very well","My friend and I wanted to go see this for Halloween. We liked the idea of a hotel for monsters. We both hated it. The characters moved in very OTT way and it was distracting. Every shot was a close up on someone's face, I just wanted to push them away from the camera. The jokes weren't funny, it has the typical Adam Sandler toilet jokes that just make me groan. Jonathon was REALLY annoying. He was this films' Jar Jar. But worst of all we have the ""Liar Revealed"" cliché. Dracula pretends this human is a monster, they keep the lie up, at the end everyone finds out, they banish the human but then they realize they liked human so they want him back before he gets home.We've seen this MILLIONS OF TIMES!However, there were a few things I liked about it; the flying tables scene was very creative. It was like a Terry Gilliam scene, Steve Bucemi's wolfman was funny and there were a few good gags. The animation was nice and Mavis was cute in a very goth way.I hated it, but I'll give it a 4 for at least trying.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Warm and funny,"Like all the fathers who love their children, Dracula has tried everything to protect her daughter. This kind of affection doesn't ask for return, but does everything.

A fun animation set in a hotel for monsters who fear humans,"This film opens in 1895 as Dracula is planning to open a luxury hotel where monsters can stay free from the fear that human mobs will burn then, stake them or otherwise harm them... it also means his baby daughter, Mavis, will never have to see a dreaded human. The action then moves forward to the present day and Dracula is about to throw a hundred and eighteenth birthday party for Mavis. She is keen to see more of the world but Dracula has plans to make her change her mind. Then things go wrong... just as the guests arrive a human turns up. He is Jonathan Loughran, a twenty one year old backpacker. Dracula quickly disguises him as a monster so other guests won't think the hotel is unsafe... that is the least of his worries though; Mavis likes him!There were elements of this film I really liked; the central characters; particularly Dracula, Mavis and Johnathan are a lot of fun. Similarly I liked the child-friendly portrayal of classic horror characters; Dracula, Frankenstein (actually the monster not the scientist), the Mummy and the Werewolf... along with their families. There were plenty of laughs to be had; even if some were a little crude for my tastes. The animation was very impressive even when watched on a small television although it is clear that many shots were designed to make use of 3D in the cinema version. The character designs are good and the voice cast do a fine job bringing them to life. Overall I'd say this is a fun film for fans of computer generated animation... it's not up with Disney/Pixar but it passed the time nicely.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Light joyful fun, Hotel Transylvania is a shockingly good time for all","From the outside, Hotel Transylvania may look like a clichéd and typical aim-at-the-kids-mooch-off-the-adults animated film with pop music, celebrities, cute characters, and plenty of childish humor. It may look like a film that doesn't strive for the heights of Pixar and instead aims for the likes of Dreamworks' lesser efforts. And from a film buff's perspective, it may look like an animated movie with known production hell that was tossed at September to just collect some cash and lessen the losses.But, Hotel Transylvania actually delivers. Surprisingly, and in many departments. It did not just succeed in pleasing the kids, but it actually entertains the adults with quick zany Tex Avery humor with very minimal downtime. Similar to the original Madagascar flick that remains DreamWorks' most consistently entertaining franchise, this movie rapidly fires jokes high, low, and direct to catch the kids, teenagers, and adults off-guard. They took the classic father/growing daughter concept and gave it a clever monster twist that allows for plenty of creativity.And if there is a man that can handle potential creativity, it's the incredibly underrated director Genndy Tartakovsky. Tartakovsky was behind such cartoon gems like Dexter's Laboratory, Powerpuff Girls, the original Clone Wars, and of course, Samurai Jack. He knows how to time jokes, how to time emotion, and knows when his product might be overstaying its welcome. This movie clocks in at a mere 91 minutes, so the movie never feels like its dragging. The script went through so many changes, but they hired the right guy to help mold it into a good backdrop to all the visual humor that dominates the source of all the laughter you'll experience.As previously stated, the overbearing father conflict is supported by an original concept so it never feels like previously charted waters. But let's also hand it to the voice cast for not hamming up the script. Adam Sandler isn't exactly the most prolific actor for doing accents, but with his Sandler touch and knowledge of when to cut back on his material makes for a surprisingly good performance. Partnering up once again is Adam Samberg, and those two work off each other quite well in an Abbot and Costello manner. Rounding out the fun cast is Devid Space, Steve Buscemi, Kevin James, Jon Lovitz, Selena Gomez, and the hilarious Luenell in a limited role.Bottom Line: Hotel Transylvania isn't deep and doesn't carry any cinematic weight, but is indeed a very enjoyable film with plenty of surprises, humor, and even a good bit of heart. It's perfect for kids with the fun cast of characters and silly jokes while it's perfect for adults because it is short, clean-cut, and also has some great adult humor to boot. Tartakovsky took a doomed project and injected plenty of life to it with his brand of humor and his ability to pack plenty of rich content into a limited about of time. Don't let the look or reputation of the studio fool you, this movie packs a light delightful punch.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Harmless Halloween fun,"Hotel Transylvania is harmless Halloween fun. It's not as clever as Nightmare Before Christmas and it's not as nostalgic as Mad Monster Party, but my kids liked it and it isn't too scary for their age group.

Great animated movie with all the classic movie monsters...,"""Hotel Transylvania"" really surprised me in a good way. I was a little bit concerned about taking all the classic movie monsters and put them together in an animated movie. But this really turned out to be a great experience.The animation is really great and the characters are so unique and memorable, and they have just the right amount of Tim Burton-touch to them without being too much copies of his usual style of art. There is a lot of great details to the characters and they all really have their own personalities and characteristics. But not only the characters were amazingly detailed, the scenery, settings and surroundings were also nicely fleshed out and brought to life on the screen.As for the story, well then director Genndy Tartakovsky managed to put a great story together and execute it nicely on the screen. You are instantly sucked in and drawn deep into the storyline and bond with many of the characters.The story itself is about Count Dracula who is running a hotel in the middle of a dark, scary and haunted forest; a hotel for monsters only. However, a human appears on the threshold of the monster hotel one day. And as if a human visitor wasn't enough for the count to deal with, then his daughter was also coming of age and was showing an alarming interest in the world outside the hotel; the world of the living.""Hotel Transylvania"" has a pretty impressive list of people on the cast list, and they are doing really good jobs with the voice acting. Personally, I really enjoyed Steve Buscemi (as Wayne), Kevin James (as Frankenstein) and Fran Drescher (as Eunice). But the rest of the cast were also doing great jobs.""Hotel Transylvania"" is a nice animated movie that is enjoyable for both youngsters and us older people as well. I enjoyed it because it had a funny story, was stuffed with great animation and it had that semi-goth feel to it and dealt with all the movie monsters that I grew up with and loved then and love today as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Grand Hotel,"Set in a world in which monsters fear the wrath of human beings, Count Dracula runs a refuge and has to hide the fact that his latest guest is really a lost human backpacker this animated comedy. While never short on imagination, the film begins poorly with lame flatulence and urination gags as well as silly wordplay with terms like ""holy rabies"" and ""scream cheese"". The humour does not really improve as the movie progresses either (fingers stuck up noses), but the main characters become well developed and likable, especially the backpacker - an avid horror fan who enjoys interacting with the monsters with a natural curiosity, sticking his hands into skeletons and so forth. Some of the backdrop gags work well too (the backpacker beaten up by an invisible knight) and there is a great sequence towards the end where the monsters come across a town in which they are celebrated as horror legends rather than feared. The film does, however, also become more sentimental as it progresses, especially as Dracula's daughter predictability falls in love, but the overall product is more enjoyable than one might expect from the barrage of toilet humour and groan-inducing wordplay puns early on.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
It looked like a winner,"It was the recent ad campaign for the sequel that brought ""Hotel Transylvania"" to my attention (much to the delight of my five-year-old), but the movie never really gets above ""eh"". It has the usual stale kids' movie humor of recent years, complete with de rigeur auto-tuned musical numbers. For this level of spastic comedy, I was hoping for more laughs, and it's a fairly blah selection of voice talent for the cast. Mostly, it's short on laughs and feels long at just 90 minutes. On the bright side, there's an upward-surge when they finally venture outside the hotel walls (finally giving Buscemi some much-needed spotlight).My kid liked it, so the movie's got that going for it. But for entertainment that offers multi-generational appeal, I'll have to look elsewhere.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Chix Chat on Film Review: Monstermania.,"Hotel Transylvania comes across in the trailer as a monster good time where Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) hosts all the legendary monsters at his hotel to celebrate his daughter's birthday while he works overtime to keep his daughter from falling for a human, who haphazardly stumbles upon the hotel. The story was interesting in how humans were viewed from the point of view of the monsters, as not just the enemy but as fearsome. I couldn't really figure out why Johnny (Andy Samberg) would be out hiking alone in Transylvania, I couldn't figure out why Mavis (Selena Gomez) wouldn't just bat out and see Haweewee or the world for that matter, and I couldn't figure out why Drac's bat was only slightly sun sensitive. There was some fun to be had watching this film and it was clear how when anyone ages, their idea of fun is totally different from that of young hundred and eighteen year olds. I did notice from the laughter in the theater that children don't really get it with some of the humor it just has to be physical, and I know that the children didn't understand the underlying story of an overprotective father. But, with the very spirited young wolves, the green smoke joke and all the colorful creatures, this was a good film for tweens. There was an interesting moment when Johnny was asked if he believed that humans, all humans were ready to accept monsters, but the reality is even with films like Twilight romanticizing a relationship with a vampire, it doesn't change the fact that if a being came out of the coffin who lives off of human blood, survival instincts on both sides would kick in and someone would have to go! I was fond of Ceelo's mummy and found Steve Buscemi's wolf to be as believable as any father with a massive brood, exhausted! Fran Drescher's Eunice was so Real Housewives of New Jersey and Luenell's Shrunken Head cracked me up. I have to agree with Johnny that Dracula's accent and behavior was over the top. It was kind of creepy when he would fang out, yet this was a charming little story that was entertaining and fun even if Mavis did borrow from Puss in Boots when she wanted her way. It will garner an audience that will appreciate it for what it is, an hour and a half of movie viewing escapism. I give it an amber light.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Creative scenarios and backgrou is what drives this flick,"This is a fun animated comedy that the whole family can enjoy on Halloween. Yeah it lacks substance when it comes to the plot. But the creative animation sequences when it comes to the different monsters and certain scenarios sort of make up for it. The message of this movie at the end also has been done a bunch of times but it's alright. I was starting to have no good expectations for Adam Sandler movies but this one is good. And it would be cool if his movies start to improve, instead of dumb toilet humors that aren't clever or all that funny. It worked in a couple of his other movies but it's starting to deteriorate. Anyways Adam Sandler nailed it as the voice of a grumpy and yet likable vampire Dracula unlike Barnabas Collins(Johnny Depp). And the romance elements isn't developed enough including the relationships but certain scenes and wacky scenarios makes this movie watchable. The story is basically about Dracula who is owner of a hotel where all monsters gather to enjoy there time away from humans who they think of as a huge threat. And on this occasion to also celebrate his daughters 118th birthday, a daughter Dracula swore to protect from humans. And he throws these lame parties but the daughter wants to go out and see the world outside of the hotel. And when a human teen stumbles upon the hotel things go in a different direction from the generic monsters daily routine in the hotel. Although it lacks depth it's a fun animated movie that the whole family can enjoy on Halloween.7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A waste of a dynamic, gorgeous animated film","When I first heard about this project, I was excited. How could I not be? I've been a monster fan since I was able to be a fan of things, and have enjoyed Genndy Tartakovsky since my very first exposure to his vivid, highly-stylised work. Then came the bad news: the voice cast. Upon seeing that not only Adam Sandler, but also David Spade, Kevin James, Fran Drescher and Selena Gomez were attached, my heart sank. What was this? The worst, most pandering cast they could find? So, I decided I could skip this one, Tartakovsky or not. The film showed at our local theatre, and I let the wife and daughter go with friends and without me. They came back pretty pleased, but not excited enough to make me feel like I'd missed anything. So, I waited for it to come out on home video. Having finally gotten to see it, all my expectations have been confirmed: the film was fantastic to look at, with animation more full of animated life (as opposed to 'real' life, a la most computer-animated films) than I've seen in...maybe ever; the voice cast was awful. It's an entertaining premise (though one I feel has been visited before), and one that has the potential to gather together great monsters in a human-free environment to unwind and show us their 'true' personalities. That much was realised, but only as far as the voice talent could take it. Sandler's Dracula was lackluster and as empty as his performances tend to be. Most of the rest of the cast could have been anyone, really. Even their heaviest hitter talent-wise, Steve Buscemi, was so underplayed as to be non-existent. And Samberg's character, the sole human in the story? Oof. Could they have made him sympathetic to anyone but the most obnoxious late-teen douchebags? And I'm not even going to touch the non-Mothersbaugh soundtrack. Though, to paraphrase the young son of an eminent animation man: movies always end with dancing anymore. Okay, I know that cranky geeks in their 40s are not the target audience for this movie. But maybe it should have been. Clearly, they weren't going to get the Twilight crowd, and the movie was a little too light-hearted for the Twilight-lash-back crowd. Outside of that, who was going to see this movie and actually care what was on the screen in front of them? Monster fans and animation freaks! While neither of those are likely to be completely let down by Hotel Transylvania, I doubt this is one of which any audience is going to need repeat viewings. Except, perhaps, with the sound off.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Family Friendly, Festive and Fun!","There are very few movies anymore that are truly kid friendly, but i truly enjoyed this one! The best part is it has nice messages for both kids and parents. My boys loved the whole monster theme. I personally would wait till a child is 8 or 9 before letting them see it only in case they may fear goofy monsters and voices. It was nice as an adult to have some unexpected clean laughs. The many generational perspectives, and even in an odd way, cultural perspectives can make this an easy film for a broad range of ages to enjoy, from 8 to 70 years. I also enjoyed hearing good old stars like Kevin James, Adam Sandler, and Fran Dresher as the voices. As an 80's teenager i have a natural respect for these actors, actresses, and ""90's feel"" films. I did not see it in 3D, but based on the animation i just saw, i am sure it would even be better in 3d. So this would be a fabulous film to add to the October/Halloween festivities.

"Almost on the Edge of Giving It a 7, But WTH!","Hotel Transylvania is the latest Sony Pictures Animation movie. It's about Count Dracula, who builds this hotel for monsters where they can relax and be isolated from humans. But secretly, the main reason he creates it is so that his daughter will be safe from danger. So when a human accidentally enters the hotel, Dracula has to do everything he can to prevent the other guests to find out or even suspect anything about the human being a human. But at the same time, his daughter gets involved, and there's this whole comedy-thing with wacky animation and over-the-top characters and all that.Hotel Transylvania is a movie that I was very unsure if I really liked or just liked. It was kind of in the middle. But after some long thinking, I came to the conclusion that it's a very good movie that I really enjoyed. The main reason this movie is so good is because of the sense of humor. There are references to classic horror movies such as Frankenstein, The Invisible Man and The Fly. There are also just plain LOL-jokes and even a joke that directly criticizes Twilight. I mean, wow! Sony Pictures Animation have always been known for their great sense of humor (most notably in 2009's Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs). But I think this one takes the cake.But the reason I was skeptical whether I really liked it or just liked it was that the story is incredibly uninteresting. Ironically enough, for a movie that has a scene making fun of Twilight, the main plot of the movie is a love story between Dracula's daughter and the human visitor. The love story isn't bad, just cliché and forgettable. The story also doesn't really have any true twists and turns, besides one that's small and pretty insignificant. It's basically just the ""it's been a misunderstanding, we have to get back the person that misunderstood before it's too late""-type of plot points.The story also had potential. There is one scene where we learn about Dracula's past, and it's actually pretty dark and emotional. But they blew it by not doing anything with that plot and just kept on going with the romantic comedy story.With all these gripes aside, I really did enjoy Hotel Transylvania, mainly because it is such a good comedy. And not just for animation, it is right up there with being a great comedy. It's not as funny as The Dictator or Ted, obviously, but it is a very enjoyable movie that's hard not to enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

I enjoyed my stay at 'Hotel Transylvania',"Though it lacks its subtle (and sometimes subversive) sophistication, 'Hotel Transylvania' is definitely in the spirit of the old Rankin/Bass classic 'Mad Monster Party?'. The Adam Sandler players are all here, and they all appear to be having a good time, which seems to be the movie's sole purpose (as it refreshingly lacks the heavy handed messages so often employed in these kinds of films). It's not really all that funny, but it is high energy fun that never slows down, and a perfect Halloween movie for kids and pre-teens that adults can enjoy (or at least tolerate), too.

Now I know this is meant to appeal to children (though there are a few scenes, that are borderline to say the least, if shown to the little ones), but that doesn't mean it has to be stupid. Pixar set a high standard of course, but other studios have followed and there have been quite a few entertaining fun animated movies.While this isn't DOA (or undead to stay with the theme), it clearly lacks heart. This pun was not planned, but it is in tune with the jokes of the movie. Most seem not planned and just ridiculous. Does that mean you won't have fun watching this? No, you might even have more fun with this than I had with ParaNorman (a far superior movie, though not perfect either). As the rating shows on IMDb, many loved the movie and I hope you do too.

Good Monsters,"Hotel Transylvania (2012)*** (out of 4)Nice animated film about Dracula growing protective of his new daughter so he creates Hotel Transylvania in hopes that she will always stay there and never enter the ""real world"" with humans. This location would also be the perfect getaway for other monsters but on her 118th birthday, the daughter decides she wants to experience a new type of life and she gets her chance when a teenage boy sneaks into the hotel. It seems like most people went into this movie not expecting much but it really turned out to be pretty good and especially if you're a fan of monster movies. I think kids are really going to enjoy everything going on but there's also a lot of stuff for adults including some terrific winks to previous monster movies like BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN and THE INVISIBLE MAN. What I liked most about this film were all the monsters because there's so much imagination going on inside the hotel. I thought the big guys like Dracula, Frankenstein's monster, the mummy and the various werewolves were all very fun but even the smaller characters were a blast. Just check out the brain that gets stepped on by the teenager. Another plus is that the vocal work is extremely good with Adam Sandler leading the way as Dracula but we also get nice work from Fran Drescher, Kevin James, Selena Gomex, Andy Samberg, Steve Buscemi and David Spade. The animation is top-notch throughout as the entire look of the sets are very good. HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA has a few flaws along the way but for the most part it's entertaining and well worth watching.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Fast-Paced, Witty and Just Plain Fun","Hotel Transylvania is basically a love letter to the classic horror movies and clichés that surround them. Dracula is the owner of a huge castle in Transylvania where he invites other monsters to come and spend their time without fear of being judged or hunted by humans. Aptly calling it ""Hotel Transylvania."" The plot kicks off the night before his daughter Maven's 118th birthday. She wants nothing more than to go outside and explore the world but Dracula is reluctant about this because he thinks that humans would kill her without a second thought due to her being a vampire. Things are shaken up though when a human named Johnathan unexpectedly arrives in Hotel Transylvania. Now Dracula has to keep Johnathan's humanity a secret from his fellow monsters and try to stop Maven from developing any feelings for him.Hotel Transylvania is a very fast-paced movie. The humor often flies in your face a mile a minute and each joke will last just long enough for it to resonate in your mind before moving on to the next one. And most of the jokes are actually pretty funny. Granted there's a few obvious puns in there but they're handled pretty well. And the film knows when to slow down in order to let the plot tell itself. Like the scenes with Dracula and Maven. You can tell that Dracula has a deep love for his daughter and only wants to protect her, and that she loves him too but also wants a little independence. Their relationship is actually handled a lot differently than the stereotypical relationship a father and daughter have in animated movies. They hardly ever fight, except for a scene near the middle, and obviously have a mutual respect and love for one another. That was a heartwarming touch that's a real refresher when compared to other animated films like The Little Mermaid.The animation itself has a nice blend of CGI and Cartoon physics. The characters move very flexibly and often make faces straight out of a Tex Avery cartoon which is a style not often seen in CGI. Each of the characters stand out, there's a Frankenstein (complete with wife), a Wolfman, a Mummy even the Invisible Man shows up. There's also one shot gags and side characters that manage to leave an impression even if they only show up on screen for a few seconds, like a hydra, a fish-man, or even Bigfoot. No character seems to overstay their welcome.Granted having the movie in such a fast-pace is gonna damage a few things. While the parts that are meant to make you feel for the characters are handled pretty well they often move too fast to really leave that much of an effect on you. Without giving anything away there's a scene in the end which plays with how humans react to actual monsters that felt a little too rushed and too forced.But overall this film has a lot to keep you invested. Funny jokes, good looking animation and a lot of likable and hilarious characters. The voice acting is pretty good too with an all star cast like Adam Sandler, Andy Sandburg, Selena Gomez and more. I'm glad I saw this movie and it just put me in a good mood by the time the credits rolled. I say give it a chance. Kids are definitely gonna enjoy it's cartoon humor while adults can appreciate the relationship Dracula has with his daughter, friends and even Johnathan. All in all there's something everyone can enjoy in it and that's a real rarity nowadays.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
You'd think the talented cast could have done a little more with the material.,"'HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA': Three Stars (Out of Five)Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Kevin James, Steve Buscemi, Fran Drescher, Molly Shanon, David Spade, Jon Lovitz, Chris Parnell and other comedy talents voice this computer-animated kid's monster movie directed by Genndy Tartakovsky (of 'SAMURAI JACK' and 'DEXTER'S LABORATORY' fame). It was written by Peter Baynham (co-writer of movies like 'BORAT' and 'BRUNO') and Robert Smigel (a long time veteran writer of 'SNL' and 'LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN') as well as new writers Todd Durham, Dan Hageman and Kevin Hageman. The film tells the story of Dracula running a hotel for monsters, to get away from humans, and his daughter, who wants to venture out and see the world. The movie was a huge blockbuster around the world grossing $321 million on a budget of just $85 million. Despite it's immense popularity it only received lukewarm reviews from critics. I thought it was good for a kids movie of it's type but nothing spectacular. I'd put it in the same league as the animated kids monster film 'PARANORMAN'.Adam Sandler voices Dracula and Selena Gomez voices his daughter Mavis. Dracula is throwing a 118th birthday party for Mavis at his hotel and has invited monsters from all around. Monsters like Frankenstein (Kevin James) and Wayne the werewolf (Steve Buscemi) bring their families to vacation there away from the evil humans. Dracula and the rest of the monsters are afraid of humans and do their best to hide from them. So when Mavis tells Dracula she wants to travel out and see the world he freaks out and goes into overprotective father mode. Especially when a 21-year-old human (Andy Samberg) stumbles on to the castle and Mavis shows interest in him.The movie is really simplistic and uninspired in it's story structure and character development but the animation is cool and the actors are great. I don't usually enjoy kid's cartoon movies like this at all (for the problems I listed about this one) but it is funny at times thanks to the cast. Sandler and his friends do a good job of adding character and a little more flare to an otherwise pretty generic animated movie. Tartakovsky adds some nice visual style to the material as well but you'd think the talented cast could have done a little more with the material.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6yq7kwUUDQ",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""I vant to suck your blood!!""","What is it with most modern animations, when all the cast have to end the film by embarking on an embarrassing song & dance routine? It was entertaining in Shrek, but more than a decade on the sight of various individuals shaking their stuff and caterwauling into a microphone to 'popular hits' has worn thinner than Kate Moss. Stop it. Now.Aside from that misstep, this is a fun frolic in a world full of the most harmless monsters you're ever likely to encounter. Sure, they're ugly and have weird habits, but they wouldn't hurt a fly (In fact some of them ARE giant flies) and all they want to do is live their lives in peace. They stay away from humans, who they believe are nasty, vicious uncivilised creatures who'll kill you as soon as look at you (Not entirely inaccurate down my neck of the woods).An unrecognisable Adam Sandler plays Dracula, whose cute teenage (118 years old) daughter falls in love with a mortal... much to his disapproval. Much of the rest of the film is about him trying to keep the lovebirds apart, and the usual assortment of gross-out gags and freaky goings-on. Of course, he has a change of heart near the end, and all the stuff about feeling a ZING when you meet the one you want to spend eternity with is just cloying nonsense ( Especially when the girl's objet d'affection is a witless red-haired surfer dude)But there's more than enough fun here for both kids and adults to make it worthwhile, as the writer makes the most out of an inventive premise with more jests about The Invisible Man, Frankenstein, The Mummy etc than you ever though possible. Trust me, this is quite a feat. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
An enjoyable animated monster comedy,"Dracula(Adam Sandler) who runs hotel for monsters in Transylvania, wants to through his teenage daughter Mavis(Selena Gomez)a big birthday bash, but Mavis eagerly wants to see the world, but Dracula is afraid that the humans would want to hurt her.

An enjoyable movie,"When it comes to animated movies, Sony is normally pretty good. Hotel Transylvania is no exception. However, there are a couple of things I didn't like. Three things actually. First, is the Dracula character. I love Adam Sandler, but when it comes to the character, I can not picture Dracula. I only picture Adam Sandler in the studio trying to act like Dracula. The second thing is that for the first third of the film it seemed a little slow, then the rest of the movie seemed like a blur. Too many things happening to fast. There wasn't enough dialog or actions happening for the characters to change their minds or progress. The third thing is the (SPOILERS) song at the end. Other then that, I really enjoyed the movie. The story is entertaining, the animation is top notch for Sony. Watch it with your kids.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fine One and half hour stay at Hotel Transylvania,"The plot is unique that shows Count Dracula as the hero and humans bad. Reminds me of very few movies like Ferngully and Cannibal Holocaust that too shows humans as villains. Movie brought a good message and quite decent for children to view. Great voice by the characters and fine visuals throughout the movie. The Character designs were so good with good animation that could make children scream 'awwo!' at the monsters.The bottom line is that, except from being predictable and it must be for children, I enjoyed watching all other aspects of the movie with my 3 year old niece and it did bring out the child within me.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Meltingpot of celebrity monsters meets human Amurican,"The movie, mostly for kids, is quite lame. But it redeems itself a bit in the second half where roles are somewhat reversed.

Children's flick,"This film doesn't bring anything new to the overstuffed animation scene.The idea itself is somewhat interesting, presenting monsters as good guys and humans as villains (although actually there are no REAL villains here, every character is quite lovable and friendly). Perhaps this idea could have been developed somewhat more seriously, thus making the film emerge from the vast sea of similar flicks, nevertheless it's interesting enough to watch without getting bored.I would say that for grown-ups, this movie won't be too interesting to anyone, except the die-hard animation fans. To children, however, I believe this would be a very interesting film, especially those that fear of monsters under the bed or in the closet - this one might just put those fears to rest.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Adam Sandler movie in years,"Adam Sandler more often than not leaves me absolutely cold. His sense of humour is too simplistic and lowbrow for me to enjoy it. That being said, this is a great movie. It's a simple concept. What if Dracula had established himself as a hotel owner to shield all the monsters in the world from those heinous humans with their pitchforks and torches. And what then, if one day a human found his way in. Nothing extraordinary, but the execution is so good here that it simply works.The characters are the main focus. Dracula (Sandler), his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) and Jonathan, the human (Andy Samberg) are the main actors and all do a good job in selling us both the humour as well as the drama. All are somewhat stereotypical, but in a good, humorous way and they work together extremely well. Especially Dracula and Jonathan.The rest of the characters are familiar monsters, ghouls and aberrations from various mythologies and stories. All are given enough of a twist to make them unique and their various quirks are fun to witness.The animation is also superb. Extremely fluid and smooth as well as fast-paced to the extreme. It also has a good distinctive style that suits the comedic tone. Not the best animated film I've ever seen, but it can easily stand next to anything Pixar or Dreamworks put out.As a whole Hotel Transylvania was a pleasant surprise. Definitely recommended for all ages.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A fun, family-friendly monster mash","""Hotel Transylvania,"" directed by Genndy Tartakovsky, is an animated comedy that offers a delightful twist on classic monster lore. The story revolves around Count Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler), who runs a high-end resort for monsters away from the prying eyes of humans. The plot thickens when a human boy, Jonathan (voiced by Andy Samberg), stumbles upon the hotel and falls for Dracula's daughter, Mavis (voiced by Selena Gomez).The film boasts vibrant animation and an array of entertaining characters, each bringing their unique charm to the story. Adam Sandler's portrayal of the overprotective yet endearing Dracula adds humor and heart to the film. The supporting cast, including Kevin James, Steve Buscemi, and Fran Drescher, contribute to the lively ensemble.While ""Hotel Transylvania"" is packed with fun moments and visual gags, its storyline is fairly predictable and relies heavily on slapstick humor, which may not appeal to everyone. Nonetheless, its lighthearted tone and engaging characters make it an enjoyable watch for families and children.Overall, ""Hotel Transylvania"" is a charming and entertaining film that delivers laughs and a heartfelt message about acceptance and understanding.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Despite his best efforts to prohibit her departure, Dracula eventually decided to let her leave so that she might have her own experiences.

Surprisingly good,"Surprisingly funny movie, basically taking caricatures of many famous movie monsters (the mummy, the invisible man, and, primarily Dracula) and putting them into an animated movie, with a formulaic plot about a father (Dracula) not wanting to let his daughter grow up and have a life of her own, instead wanting to keep her under his overprotective bat wings.The silly pre-title moments made me doubt my idea to watch this one, but the animation looked incredible, and the movie, while not consistently funny, ( it does have some lulls in the action and laughs) still had enough moments when it works that it kept my attention, and kept me amused. And I needed some laughs, because I had just watched the bizarre Beyond The Black Rainbow. Seriously creepy movie, that.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Hotel Transylvania: A Charming and Entertaining Family Film,"Hotel Transylvania, directed by Genndy Tartakovsky, stands as a refreshing departure from the predictable and formulaic animation films that often dominate the genre. With its delightful blend of humor, heart, and engaging characters, Hotel Transylvania delivers a cinematic experience that entertains both children and adults alike.The film follows Count Dracula, an overprotective vampire who runs a lavish hotel exclusively for monsters, shielding them from the dangers of the human world. When his beloved daughter, Mavis, falls in love with a human traveler, Johnny, chaos ensues, testing Dracula's commitment to his protective instincts and challenging his worldview.Hotel Transylvania's charm lies in its ability to balance humor with genuine emotion. The film's humor is often goofy and lighthearted, with plenty of slapstick and exaggerated facial expressions. However, it also manages to touch upon themes of family, acceptance, and the challenges of growing up, creating a relatable and heartwarming narrative.The film's animation style is vibrant and visually appealing, capturing the essence of the monster characters while maintaining a sense of lightheartedness. The character designs are expressive and memorable, with each monster bringing a unique personality to the story.Hotel Transylvania is a fun and enjoyable film that stands out in the animation genre.

Good time killer for adults but bad for daddy image,"Watched it just now and its not quite how i thought it would be after watching trailer.It can somehow be a good time killer for adults but If you have kids and you are the daddy then you probably should avoid it for them because its gonna give them an idea that daddies are stupid dump Villon figures. Storyline is full of interesting characters and thats probably is the most amazing thing about this movie.. Even if they don't seems to have anything do with the real plot you'll enjoy their individual portrayal in the movie. Dialogues are funny most of times and comedy is quite timely. So count it for the best thing in this movie but ""the end"" could have been much better.

So horrible and boring,"Once upon a time, Dracula built a hotel where is isolated and far from human existence.

A day before the party starts, teenage human called Jonathan come to hotel after experience long journey. Dracula who find out him at his hotel, is so panic and tries to get rid of him before the party starts. Unfortunately, Mavis and Jonathan meet and fall in love that forced Dracula to pick right decisions for his daughter.'Hotel Transylvania' starts with an interesting and promising storyline that make people hope these would be so fun and hilarious. The concept is quite attractive and make me curious what would happen next when they introduce hotel for monsters. Unfortunately, the movie left with a disappointment. The storyline is not focus, sometimes really annoying and the plot is flat from start through the end. They tried to make people laugh with it's joke which is not funny at all. Also Jonathan's character is too annoying, they should put him in right role. Overall, 'Hotel Transylvania' is mostly just a joke. The animation perhaps not bad but with that standard storyline, unfunny line and annoying character, this movie become so forgettable.

Her father, based upon his negative experiences, goes to great lengths to keep his daughter from the bad world outside of the Hotel Transylvania walls.

"""Scream Cheese!""","Hotel Transylvania (1) (2012) -Having seen bits of this film series here and there, I didn't enjoy this chapter as much as I'd hoped to.It really wasn't a bad film at all and I could obviously see the appeal for the younger generation, but it was a bit fast and silly to start with.There were some clever and cute horror references, but it was definitely for kids, with it's more simplistic puns, and slapstick styled fun.It could also have done with more jokes for everyone, perhaps a bit more innuendo for the adults akin to those in 'Despicable Me' (2010) and 'Toy Story' (1995) for instance.Because of the cast the tone and comedy had some obvious similarities to 'Grown Ups/2' (2010/13). The story of friends gathering for a holiday added to that feeling as well, even if these characters had fangs or howled at the moon, which they obviously didn't in the other films.David Spade seemed to be perfectly cast as The Invisible Man. His personality and style suited the character and his loser nature really well. I wasn't overly convinced by Adam Sandler as Dracula though and I think that was to do with his voice.Everyone else was just fine, but they didn't really have anything to prove in their smaller roles.Overall it wasn't laugh out loud hilarious, but it was still fun and probably enjoyable to watch with a little one. The colours were bright and the animation well rendered. I'd definitely watch it with my own kids, if a miracle ever lets me have some, even if it was just to help desensitise them to the bogey men and realise that monsters aren't really scary at all.

Wasted Potential,"Released during the fall of 2012, Hotel Translyvania is directed by Genndy Tartakovsky and tells the story of Dracula, an overprotective father who manages a hotel for monsters. On one fateful night before his daughter's birthday, a young human tourist stumbles upon the hotel not realizing that the guests aren't just wearing spooky Halloween costumes. This fish out of water tale was a massive success at the box office and featured the voices of many notable celebrities including Adam Sandler, Selena Gomez, Andy Samberg and Kevin James just to name a few.Hotel Transylvania is a wonderful concept on paper, taking the Universal Monsters (along with other iconic spooky characters) and placing them in a hotel where they all congregate is a great spin. While the film does do a lot of clever things with the idea, I never felt Hotel Translyvania reached its full potential. With the film intended for children, there is a lot of family-friendly material involved, including the tropes of a couple of song/dance numbers, tiresome jokes and gags, but at the heart of the film was the concept, sadly the story doesn't quite do it justice. As I mentioned from the top, there is a main plotline that places a character seemingly out of his element. Jonathan, voiced by Andy Samberg, is a young, free spirit, tourist who finds himself in a hotel of monsters and that creates a big problem for Adam Sandler's Dracula as he has prided the hotel as being human free. This in and of itself would have been good enough, even the way in which Jonathan was kept around was fun, but the whole Daddy-Daughter angle and eventual love subplot between Jonathan and Mavis felt very conventional. There are plenty of films that cover themes of an overbearing parent who just wants the best for their child even if the lengths they go are a bit demanding and topics of young adult romance have all been done as good, if not better. Hotel Transylvania tries nothing new, instead, leaning on the concept of everyone being monsters (outside of Jonathan), although there are clever gags sprinkled throughout, the film is as by the numbers as one can get.A conventional story can be tolerable if there are other factors about a movie that elevates it beyond just being average and one of those elements is Hotel Transylvania's animation. Although it is a 3D animated movie, at its heart Hotel Translyvania consists of many features present in a traditional 2D animated film, with comedic slapstick bits and characters contorting in all different ways. It was a treat to see a new school movie with an old school approach and I must commend the animators for doing such a good job on the movie. Now one thing I can't commend sadly comes from one of the important factors to an animated children's film, the voice acting. Outside of Adam Sandler, I was never completely sold on the voice acting, even Andy Samberg and Selena Gomez had some hit or miss lines that felt like they could have been rerecorded. The biggest offenders of this actually come from Kevin James, Steve Buscemi and David Spade who were particularly bad and came across like they were just there to cash a paycheque. Many of their lines felt forced and lacked the emotion required for their scenes - their character would do something interesting yet their voice sounded uninterested, it was honestly fairly disappointing and really dragged down the film.Hotel Transylvania is one of those films that has a lot going for it but struggled to use those foundations to be great. It is a perfectly fine family film that I'm sure would be a hit for any child and might even get a few chuckles out of the parents. It's still a fun film at the end of the day and is something I can recommend, especially around Halloween as it's a decent film to put on during that time of the year. I just wanted a bit more out of the film than I got and for that reason, I am giving Hotel Transylvania a 6.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Fun but not really funny, enjoyable but not enthralling, merely an appetizer for Frankenweenie.","Today my ten-year-old niece overruled me. Her treat, her call and Hotel Transylvania won the duel over Frankenweenie. Oh well, she'll learn and Burton's latest will earn a review later in the week.Hotel Transylvania is the latest in the current wave of kiddie horrors and certainly better than last month's Paranorman, but let's hope it isn't as good as it gets.Following the death of his wife, Dracula (Adam Sandler) creates his Hotel Transylvania as a resort where monsters can holiday safe from the intrusion of nasty humans and where he can ensure his daughter, Mavis (Selina Gomez), can spend her life under his (over) protection. Fast forward a century and a bit to her one hundred and eighteenth birthday and all of Dad's friends arrive for the 118th time to celebrate. Daddy Drac is trying to organize the same party he's staged for the past century and Mavis is monumentally cheesed off by feeling trapped when the door opens and in stumbles Jonathan (Andy Samberg), the kind of human your father would groan at and your mother would pity if you brought home.There follows 90 odd minutes of Dracula's ineptitude, Jonathan's geekiness, Mavis' frustration and a predictable meeting of minds (of sorts). Oh, and love might be in the air. While Hotel Transylvania flows fairly smoothly and it entertains, it never really hits any great heights and the final act is tied up rather too neatly, obviously and without imagination. Whereas animation was once the domain of Disney, Pixar appears to own it now (and, yes, they are now part of Walt's company) but Sony Pictures Animation is trying hard to catch them. Their highpoints, Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and Aardman's The Pirates! In an Adventure With Scientists!, fall short of the brilliance of Pixar's WALL.E and Monsters Inc. but Hotel Transylvania is a definite step forward.While none of the voices stand out in the way Robin Williams did in Aladdin, all are suited to their characters and nothing jars, though no-one makes the ears tingle. That said, any film is improved by the presence of the put-upon Steve Buscemi, in this instance playing werewolf Wayne, long-suffering father to an anarchic brood too numerous to count.Whilst the belly laughs are non-existent, there is a real joy to be had from watching the disparate crew of monsters dancing and performing water aerobics, the animation is expressive and detailed and, overall, Hotel Transylvania is a very enjoyable, if unremarkable viewing experience, although the biggest smile of the film occurred when, upon the date appearing on the screen in the prologue, my niece whispered, ""Uncle Yed, were you born in 1895?"" Her verdict? 8 out of 10. I'm going to downgrade it to six because it could have been so much more. And it really, really annoys me that writers Peter Baynham and Robert Smigel don't know that Frankenstein was the human and NOT THE $%^*&!!! CREATURE!!!!

I feel like the story is constantly changing pace and tone, but it still manages to deliver a message about not judging before you meet someone and that not everything is as we thought.Children will enjoy it, but the story is not so well managed that sometimes it does not seem like it is about resolving a conflict and this makes the film less enjoyable.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great animated movie for all ages (and I was really surprised!),"I grew up on the great CGI movies by Pixar, Dreamworks and Blue Sky studios just like most of the folks my age. Before last September I had never saw nor tried the HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA franchise and thought I was too old for these (see, I was 23). But since the voice over cast is full of actors I like, I finally saw the first and to my surprise, I loved to the point I was even scoring it a 10 and didn't even expected it! Wanna know why? Then read my following text.Count Drac (voice by Adam Sandler) is the owner of the Hotel Transylvania, where all monsters can go for organizing parties and staying all together. The monsters think that the humans are the enemy and yet they are gentle, funny and likeable. Drac is also an overprotective father and doesn't want that his daughter (voice by Selena Gomez) goes out of the castle because humans might kill her but, weirdly enough, a human arrives casually in the castle when the daughter has a huge birthday party. Drac convinces Jonathan (voice by Andy Samberg) to dress like a monster and blend and this works too well because Drac's daughter falls in love with Jonathan and only after lots of misunderstandings the father will finally accept his daughter's true love.The animation was great and very colorful, on par with that of Dreamworks and Pixar's masterpieces and really loved Drac's facial expressions in many moments. The voice acting was great as well: Adam Sandler is perfect for the role of Drac and Selena Gomez, Andy Samberg, Steve Buscemi, David Spade, Jon Lovitz and Kevin James are all great and entertaining giving all their soul for their characters. The soundtrack too was great, not only by composer Mark Mothersbaugh but also by various singers and their songs that were popular back in 2012 (11 years have passed man!). There were lots of funny moments, too many for mentioning them all here, but it's best if you see the movie for yourselves.In substance, a great animated movie that manages to entertain both children and adults in an equal measure without boring childless adults like me. Worth recommended and to be seen at least once... it's that great and fun!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A welcome change from the masterpieces,"""Hotel Transylvania"" is a 2012 animated feature directed by Genndy Tartakovsky with the voices of Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg. There are only a few animated feature films aside that don't origin from the power conglomerate Disney/Pixar that actually entertain me. Next to a few DreamWorks films, such as ""Shrek"", ""Kung Fu Panda"" or ""Mega Mind"" or the Illumination hit ""Despicable Me"" it is this movie from Sony that I actually like a lot. Even if it isn't the awesome film I considered it to be when I was only twelve years old, I still think it is worth giving a watch and a welcome alternation from all the masterpieces from the other studios, even from a today's point of view. And since it was the birthday of my younger sisters and they got to decide what to watch, I thought I would join them. As I said before, I like to watch it from time to time, even if it has some undeniable massive flaws I cannot close my eyes to. What I think makes this film so cute is how it introduces children to the classic monsters like Dracula, Frankenstein etc. and gives them the chance to get to know them for the very first time in their life. For avid horror fans it probably is also a nice welcome to see their favourites in a child appropriate way and it might even be some sort of fun to try to spot all the Easter eggs and variety of classic creatures used in this flick. I mean, you even get some middle-aged Gremlins that want to relax at the pool. How cool is that? Even when the premise of ""What if monsters are actually scared by humans?"" was famously illuminated in the Pixar classic ""Monsters Inc."" it is still tolerable in this case, as it adds another facet to it: racism. Yes, indeed, this film deals with the problem of stereotypical thinking and the general danger of racism and teaches the younger ones about it in a child friendly manner. On top of that it depicts the monsters as harmless and gives them human characteristics. The Werewolf is an exhausted family father with God knows how many children, Frankenstein's monster looks like a middleclass man with a middleclass job and the Invisible Man is ... well, he is invisible, but the main focus of course lies on Dracula and the close bond with his teenage daughter Mavis. Who would have guessed that the bloodsucking count is actually a caring and worried father, if not control freak? The animation style and narration are far away from being as deep as the titles from its competitors, but still it conveys an easily understandable message for both kids and parents: sometimes you got to let your kids decide on their own and sometimes it is necessary to rethink about specific things. Like, you probably don't want to be responsible for your child missing their Zing, right? This film could have been immensely better if it wasn't for one thing: Sandler. While I am personally able to laugh about most of his films, each has this typical Sandler thing to it. Any film contains at least on moment of sheer stupidity and this film makes no exception. It has this typical pinch of ""I am trying to be funny"" Sandler-esque nonsense in several scenes that made it extremely cringey and disturbed the experience a lot. Oh, and don't get me started about that dance party at the end of the film. I absolutely hate autotune and the music genre attached to it. It makes me break out in spots in the matter of seconds. Urgh. All in all though, this film is a decent flick I like to rewatch from time to time and even when it is far away from reaching the high quality of the other studios, it works for younger children and that's the audience this film has aimed for. It is cute, has a lot of good ideas and most importantly, doesn't lack any heart. It is nothing an adult would probably consider to be the best, but a fun flick to watch in between with your kids. To be honest, I am going to check out the sequels as well. Let's see if they are at least as enjoyable as this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

There is both good and bad in every person. But family is the most valuable thing we have.

"Not extraordinary, not bad.","These are the kind of movies that you can watch over and over again because somehow their characters have become lovable. Although it is difficult to identify with one of them (that is to say, neither of them is especially lovable) the chemistry between them makes the experience of enjoying the film relatable. There are certain funny moments (the reference to Robert Pattison is my favorite) that hide the great fault of this work: the maudlin situations. Despite this, it complies in order to entertain without worrying parents too much about ideas or situations that, disguised in the script, would today be seen more severely.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Screenplay is great and the animation is just tad excellent! I must appreciate the Sony production for a fantastic outline and for using large amounts of sarcasm. I enjoyed all the satirical takes on various elements. And this movie works as parallel universe - an amazing topic!It talks about the Father factor and how he strives to protect her; on the other hand the daughter's take on how he behaves and even though it is set in imaginary parallel universe - the values, virtues and principles are similar to the human psychology. Enjoyed it!I never really got bored while watching this and even though I knew what the Dracula wanted for her daughter, the plot still intrigued me. I wonder why it was not AMPAS nominated.

Fun but also cringy,"This movie was coming on the TV, so I was watching it with my mom. There were many scenes from this movie that were so cringy I felt like my mom would get furious (I will talk about them later). She didn't say anything, but I was feeling so ashamed I was trying to hide my face. Hotel Transylvania is one of those movies that are fun to watch while they last, but the moment they are over you will have nothing to remember them for. It's a generic comedy movie, similar to Minions, except this is not a cultural phenomenon. And that's not a bad thing.The story of this movie is pretty straightforward. Dracula's daughter has her 116th birthday so he has arranged a party for her with all the other monsters. However, a human has also sneaked into the party disguised as a monster and let me tell you, he's really, really disgusting and insensitive. And of course Dracula's daughter and he fall in love with each other because they are teenagers and that's literally what teenagers always do. So now Dracula is very angry because his family has been hiding from humans. So finally when he drives that human away his daughter gets all moody, and he's forced to get him back.There are many good things about this movie. The animation is pretty good. The comedy scenes also made me laugh, even though most of them aren't really clever jokes their references to the monsters and the comic timing make up for it. The storytelling is also not generic at all, but rather it is more focused on showing the good parts over the otherwise usual, boring ""character conflicts"" and plot twists. I really liked Dracula in this movie. The human was also very relatable.The bad things, however, are also pretty overwhelming. First of all, like I said, it's very forgettable. You must have figured out by now that I have already forgotten the names of all the characters other than Dracula because he is a cultural phenomenon (not because of this movie of course). That's why I have been calling the characters ""the human"" and ""Dracula's daughter"" since I don't even remember what their names were. Secondly like I said, there was too much cringe. The parts where Dracula's daughter says that she will give up on her father, someone she has been with for over a hundred years, for a snobby teenage tourist she met a couple of minutes ago even though she can't possibly be with him. And Dracula actually decided to help her, instead of slapping her and getting her on the right path. My mom is strictly for arranged marriages, so seeing those scenes with her made me feel she will say this is propaganda. Thank Satan she didn't say it.For me Hotel Transylvania is in the same leagues as Stuart Little and Jurassic Park. Yes it was fun and I liked it and all, but I don't have the courage to either rewatch it or see the sequels. It's too tiring to watch, so I guess I won't ever talk about it after having written this review.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
We need to talk about boundaries...,"An animated film centered around a large group of monsters featuring the voice talents of the Happy Madison gang wasn't a premise that instantly triggered my interest, however, I'm reporting back with a great sense of relieved certainty. Hotel Transylvania is a fun, spontaneously enjoyable effort that is presented with wit and stylistic touches by the highly acclaimed director, Genndy Tartakovsky (whose credentials include the cherished Dexter's Laboratory and Star Wars: Clone Wars), and a storyline that is well-told and, thankfully, refuses to exploit its father-daughter relationship.This is the second animated film I have seen that was released in the year 2012 and also centers on the complex relationships had by parents and their daughters. The last effort I saw was Pixar's Brave, an unfairly bashed spectacle that beautifully articulated a confident heroine that knew what she wanted to become, refraining from an obligatory subplot about a character lacking in direction, but was met with conflicts from her domineering mother. Hotel Transylvania lacks the moral-heaviness and amplifies the situations and events in a more rambunctious way, yet still not forgetting the elephant in the room. It balances both of these things nicely, and will consistently find ways to delight the little ones and please the older ones.The plot: We are presented with Dracula (voiced by Adam Sandler), the owner and creator of Hotel Transylvania, an enormous castle that has the ability to house hundreds of monsters and keep them safe from the activity of dreaded humans. Dracula is a widow, who is taking precious care of his daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez), who has just turned 118 years old and is young and ready to explore the world. Dracula, as one can expect, is heavy into the suturing aspect of parenting, putting fear and impossibly unrealistic notions of how unsafe and dreadfully scary the human-driven world is, and stages a setup for her to see this when she leaves the castle for the first time.He believes that after showing her ""the horrors"" of the world, Mavis is at Hotel Transylvania for good. That is until Dracula decides to throw a party, inviting fellow monsters like Frankenstein (Kevin James), Murray the Mummy (Cee Lo Green), Wayne and Wanda Werewolf (Steve Buscemi and Molly Shannon), and Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade), just when a naive young human named Jonathan (Andy Samberg) wanders onto the hotel's territory. Dracula makes every attempt possible to hide Jonathan from the monsters and vice-versa, to show that Hotel Transylvania is the human-free paradise it has been and always will be, but Jonathan soon finds himself romantically involved with Mavis, much to Dracula's dismay.There are two things that became more apparent to American audiences in 2012 when watching animated films, and those were the revival of nostalgic little things and relationships between parents and their children. Wreck-It Ralph introduced the younger generation to the beautiful machines that were arcades, inventing several new worlds and detailing them all exquisitely, while Hotel Transylvania attempts to further the ""kiddie horror movie"" genre (which has been one of the most consistent genres in animation this year) by introducing them to the classic Universal monsters. It's nothing but apparent that the cast, which is mainly comprised of Adam Sandler's Happy Madison company, has a love and respect for the iconic horror figures that shaped the genre, and in ninety-two minutes they put a clever PG-rated spin that will delight many children and please genre-purists.Pixar's Brave should be one of the films that serves as a poster-child for parental-child disconnect, where an identity crisis wasn't apparent on the main character and neither was a sense of directionless. The main theme there was compromise between a girl's mother and the girl herself, so that she could pursue the life of freedom she always wanted without contention with her mother. Hotel Transylvania shows a father's protection that goes way past that idea to channel sheltered and anti-social behavior. His daughter just wants to see the world for herself and not be gridlocked to her father's nosy, impulsively petulant nature. What needs to result is something of a compromise, and perhaps parents will see their relationships with their own children in this film and, hopefully, make some fitting adjustments.Hotel Transylvania is beautifully animated (coming from Sony Pictures Animation, a company that still may have a long way to go before its name hits the majority of households), and occupies a fluency and style that Tartakovsky has made a name for over the years. The only thing I can see being bothersome for audiences, including myself, is the somewhat frantic pacing, which hits near-breakneck speeds in the first forty minutes, but comes to a pleasantly controlled nature for the remaining fifty. There seems to be so much detail, homage, and style in the picture that maintaining a frantic pace throughout the entire course of its runtime would've been lethal to its likability.Voiced by: Adam Sandler, Andy Samberg, Selena Gomez, Kevin James, Fran Drescher, Steve Buscemi, Molly Shannon, David Spade, and Cee Lo Green.

Pretty Lame,"In the last couple of decades Pixar has raised the bar so high for animated movies, that even if a perfectly fine animated movie comes along, we end up feeling underwhelmed by it. That's precisely the case with Hotel Transylvania.Hotel Transylvania tells the story of modern day Dracula, voiced by Adam Sandler, who runs a hotel away from human world meant only for monsters. When the whole monster world – including all type of zombies, werewolfs, mummies, and Frankenstein, comes to his hotel to celebrate the birthday of Dracula's daughter's 118th birthday, a human boy discovers the hotel and falls in love with his daughter.Though it was fun to watch the whole monster world assemble under one room, but soon the proceedings get reduced to silly jokes which would make only 12 year olds laugh. I kept thinking about The Cabin in the Woods throughout the movie, where all different kind of monsters are assembled and thought even if some part of that innovation was applied in this movie, this would have been eminently watchable.The only person who could make some kind of an impact through his voice was Adam Sandler, who did a nice impersonation of Dracula's voice. But even that was unfunny after some time. But looking at his standards, I guess this was the best movie Adam Sandler would have done after Punch Drunk Love. Andy Samberg as Jonathan, the boy who discovers the hotel, is irritating, and Selena Gomez as Dracula's daughter is nothing to write about.It's a shame to see that there is already a sequel planned for this lame movie. I just hope that the sequel goes the Madagascar way and not the Ice Age and Shrek way.http://vishwas8317.blogspot.in/2012/12/hotel-transylvania-2012.html",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Hotel Transylvania is worth as an entertainment session, because in addition to being technically remarkable, it has some good moments","Who has never thought of seeing all the classic monsters of the horror universe gathered in a more, say, ""normal"" context? This is exactly what Hotel Transylvania proposes. Commanded by Count Dracula himself (Adam Sandler), the place is a refuge for these creatures against that even more frightening: the human being.The production is signed by Genndy Tartakovsky, considered the magician of Cartoon Network, after all he is responsible for the creation of some of the broadcaster's greatest hits, such as Dexter's Laboratory and Super-Powerful Girls. Both designs won over the public for coming out of the boredom in which the industry found itself. Unfortunately, it seems that Tartakovsky lost his way and surrendered to every cliché imaginable. The director had an interesting argument in hand, bringing together famous monsters and creating a film that appealed to children and adults. But the feature is far from that and far behind other recent animations of the genre. For example: in the criterion of strange creatures, ParaNorman is much superior; and if we think of good villains, Despicable Me wins out.At first the idea looks good, but it doesn't take long before everything becomes frighteningly bad. The premise is interesting, there is no denying it, the story of Count Dracula as an overprotective father, the lies he tells to protect his daughter, Mavis' willingness to know the world, her relationship with what she most wanted to know, a human, without knowing, because it is a monster, the fact that there is a place where these monsters hide, in short, there is a script concerned with details and with these and other great insights the film presents us with a good introduction. Behold, in each scene, in each new situation, the script shows its fragility and how much its good premise is wasted, weak characters and dialogues that insist on a poor mood, with the right to jokes related to burps and the like that they haven't done for years more grace and to make matters worse they sometimes waste time on satires that lack originality, like the scene shown in ""Twilight"", as if no other film had made this same joke.Above all, Hotel Transylvania is a family story. Make no mistake about the horde of references to horror cinema, which goes from the main character, Count Dracula - clearly mirrored in Bela Lugosi's Dracula - to characters openly drawn from macabre or horror sci-fi films, like Frankenstein (1931), The Invisible Man (1933), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939), The Black Lagoon Monster (1954), The Killer Bubble (1958) and Gremlins (1984). The intention of the writers and the director here was to play with these elements without removing their appearance, but adding high doses of cuteness and kindness to their essence. This affected the script and made room for a type of story that achieves little, barely reaching its own proposal.Despite having as protagonist's characters usually linked to scares and dread, in Hotel Transylvania the only objective is to make you laugh. The inversion of the paradigm works well, even if without great news. What draws the most attention, however, is the impressive technical care of the line, full of details and curiosities. The arrival of visitors in the great hall is astonishing. The topic under discussion seems to be universal and familiar to the four corners of the planet - and in fact it is - but the best part is that its approach is modern and convincing, without underestimating the intelligence of the most adult viewer or the child behind a good program.Transylvania ""is, however, frantically guided by Tartakovsky, without pauses or commas, where a huddle of characters and situations are played on the screen, following exactly the same dynamism of a cartoon episode, so its rhythm gets tired, even more when we realize that nothing is actually being told, characters come and go, badly elaborated jokes, where scenarios and locations are little explored, for example, the grand Hotel is just two rooms, Mavis' room and the main hall, very small for the genre, it doesn't work, we have the feeling that something is missing all the time.Despite the exciting start, production is lost and falls into sameness. Almost all the arguments that support the script are fragile and contradict each other at some point. The jokes that save Hotel Transylvania are made by secondary characters, mainly by the monstrous Frankenstein, by far the best figure in the film. At a certain point, Dracula says to the human Jonathan: ""Don't explain the joke"", but that is exactly what the feature insists on doing with the viewer at all times.The director is visibly pruned, the guy even looks for some striking features of his 2D projects and ventures into three-dimensionality in an amateur way, and still stylizes his characters without great vividness, although they are sufficiently expressive. In his favor are adaptations of already known monsters, which allows for obvious jokes and jokes about these, especially Frankenstein shattered, or the werewolf with his untamed pack. There are also recycling ideas, such as a moment when an animal has watery eyes, like the iconic Puss in Boots scene in Shrek (idem, 2001).It should be noted that Hotel Transylvania lacks context, content and action, which rarely presents us with comical or familiar moments. Its dramatic and moral aspect is also not very interesting, not least because it focuses almost exclusively on parental protection that guides the relationship between Count Dracula and Mavis, a relationship that is the target of a boring treatment that culminates in the transmission of classic messages like the importance of trust and love. In addition to this central theme, more secondary ones are added, but none is the subject of a more careful analysis, namely the weak and timid romantic aspect between Mavis and Johnny. All of these themes are mere accessories for the plot, as are the vast majority of monsters that keep appearing in the film and which have no practical function. And the big problem is that these accessories take up a lot of space in the film, which could be replaced by more scenes of humor and action involving the main characters.And that is what irritates in Hotel Transylvania, the laziness of the script in a technically admirable animation, whether in the movement of the characters (the animation, so to speak); the art direction and production design clearly based on furniture and architecture from Romanian cities; or in the duality between the current world, which partially accepts the stranger with a proud skepticism and the fantastic supernatural world. But in spite of the exemplary technique, the good proposal and the exciting beginning, the feature collapses in the buzzword of the romance à la Romeo and Juliet of the Semi-Darknesses and goes on to execute silly and eschatological jokes; to mix cultural concepts disorderly without even worrying about whether or not they combine with history; to blur the progress of the plot, which begins with a father-and-daughter relationship and then becomes a no-one-knows-what, with backpacker Jonathan as the center; and, especially, to abuse the viewer's patience for the Count's terrible run to the airport and the ""indirect"" contact he makes, on fire, with his future son-in-law.But there is a catch to Hotel Transylvania, and this is your cast of voices. Adam Sandler (like Dracula) and all his usual entourage - Andy Samberg, Kevin James, Molly Shannon and David Spade, among others, were brought together as voice actors. Coming from the humorous program Saturday Night Live, they explore the same type of humor in this animated version - not least because the personalities of each character were developed over the very actors who defend them. Thus, this turns out to be much more of a film by Sandler and his gang than by Tartakovsky and the style of animation he has always practiced on the small screen. If you end up playing in favor of the fans of the star, on the other hand you are disappointed for not innovating or proposing something different from what many are already used to. Even so, this is something less in the face of a proposal that does not seek to reinvent the wheel, but at least is content to invest in what it does well: having fun.Spoiled by the lack of courage of the producers, screenwriters and director to dare and really enjoy the enormous framework of possibilities they had, Hotel Transylvania is worth as an entertainment session, because in addition to being technically remarkable, it has some good moments, but in the end, there is no way to be entirely satisfied. It remains for us to know whether the sequence will keep the line of the annoying cliché or take over the reins of terror in the animation and do something that goes beyond our sense of déjà vu. Hotel Transylvania should be an entertainment for all audiences, but it does not achieve that feat. The kids are entertained, but adults and teenagers should be bored in the first half hour of viewing. In a time when technical perfection is no more than an obligation on the part of the studios, the film is just another one that should make a good box office and be forgotten in a few months.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"This has become a staple in my house, not just halloween but all year","This is the movie that has renewed my love of Adam Sandler movies (not all, there are some real stinkers in there). I never thought one of the things of becoming a dad would be an ultimate hatred for most kids movies/shows. Not because they are bad but because you are FORCED to watch them over and over and over again out of love and who can resist the ""again Daddy again!"" from their little one.It is a safe bet that I have seen this movie at least a half a dozen times this year and still found myself seeking it out around Halloween to watch. I find the voice acting is spot on, the jokes can be lame but they are also geared towards kids with the knowledge adults are watching in the background.They take usually scary characters and cram them into a hotel but put a spin on things where the monsters are the ones living in fear of humans. It has got an endearing message and overall well done. The pacing is great there are no real lulls.

Mavis's relationship with Dracula and Johnny is cute and the subversion with the humans celebrating the monsters makes sense with how much we all love Halloween.

Great voice acting and visual effects save this otherwise average animated adventure,"Although I am only 21 I feel I am too old when watching these new children's animated films. What looked like a fun, entertaining movie ended up being disjointed, manic and sentimental. It's like all the kids these days have ADD and can't concentrate on a well-told story so the filmmakers feel the need to have almost no pause in the action and just go from scene to scene with no breather, inserting pop-culture references everywhere. Even my eight year old cousin who I took to see this said the movie felt ""like it went faster than other movies.""The voice cast is excellent, with Adam Sandler, Steve Buscemi, David Spade, Andy Samberg and Kevin James lending their talents. Visually the film is quite stunning, with vibrant colours and hideous monsters sure to scare the kiddies. In terms of the 3D I wasn't really impressed but I haven't been impressed with any 3D movie as I find it adds next to nothing to the experience but hey, the children seem to love it and it brings in more money so I'm sure it's here to stay.So why does this animated kids' film fail to come together? Bursts of manic pacing steamroll over most of the wit in the story, and by the end the whole movie is bogged down by parental mush about trusting one's kid to make her own discoveries.

A Nutshell Review: Hotel Transylvania,"It's without a doubt that the trend of recent animated films have to revolve around the horror genre and/or involving legendary characters reworked to offer a unique selling point. And because the target audience is primarily the kids, the scary bits have all been toned down, becoming comedic event, to tell stories that possess feel good themes around stuff like family, friendship and the likes. So if you've not said hello to ParaNorman, Rise of the Guardians, or Frankenweenie, then why not check in to Hotel Transylvania?As you would have skimmed the story from the trailer, it involves an over-protective father, the count Dracula himself (voiced by funnyman Adam Sandler), who have for the longest time looked after his daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) as a single parent, and convincing the child that the big bad world out there is full of vengeful humans who won't bat an eyelid to get rid of those who are innately different, namely the vampires like themselves. And to fulfill this grand plan, comes his creation of Hotel Transylvania, which doubles up as safe haven for his monsters brethren to check in, and seek vacation and refuge from their human pursuers.But as Mavis becomes a teenager at 118 years old, one would come to expect the usual rebellious and curious streak in wanting to get out, explore and experience the world for herself. Then comes the surprise visit by a human - Jonathan (Andy Samberg), whose identity gets kept secret by Dracula for fear of losing his clientèle who have turned up in droves to celebrate the birthday of Mavis, and try as he might to get rid of Jonathan, one thing turns into another, with Jonathan more than welcome to stay by the hotel's guests while under disguise, and inevitably falling in love with someone who's very much his age.Directed by Genndy Tartakovsky with screenplay written by the team of Peter Baynham and Robert Smigel, Hotel Transylvania is chock full of sight gags, and inside jokes that involve the many monsters in its ensemble. There are enough surprises thrown up as the many pop cultural references get weaved into the classical backgrounds of classic monsters such as Franenstein (Kevin James) and his loud wife Eunice (Fran Drescher), the werewolf (Steve Buscemi) and his pack of kids, and he Invisible Man (David Spade), all making leading appearances, with most of the best scenes in the film involving almost everyone on screen at the same time. The romance bit perhaps came on a little too late to breathe some life into the final act, but it's something of a loose end that had to be tied up.Despite having an ensemble voice cast and a myriad of characters, some that only appear for a few scenes such as the blob, or big foot (used to great comic effect exploiting its size), the best repartee irrevocably belongs to the adversarial Dracula and Jonathan, with one adamant in getting rid of his human gatecrasher, while the other just finds the place radical enough to want to stay a little longer, at the expense of dangerously bringing himself exposed to the truth by some naysayers. Coming a close second are the rip-roaring one liners spouted by the Shrunken Heads, which convey notices outside each hotel room door.There's hardly a scary moment save for Dracula's first instance of fury which the little ones will get used to, before Hotel Transylvania takes the bull by the horns and tackle issues like for parents to let go and have trust that their children will turn out alright as they venture on their own, and for the kids to realize that their parents have nothing but their best of interests at heart. What surprised me a lot more is its square take on discrimination, and reminder on never jumping to conclusions about others, and being all inclusive and accepting of those who are different. How's that for a monster movie?The Hollywood animation formula almost always work with comedy and quality animation, and Hotel Transylvania is no different, except that it made a conscientious effort in putting together a coherent story that showed rather than told, and had good heart (Even though it's about monsters!) to teach the little ones a thing or two while having fun with its material. Recommended, and a surprise package indeed!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

likable animation and funny moments makes Hotel Transylvania more enjoyable,"Hotel Transylvania was fun-loving , feel good entertainment with great voice-over by Adam Sandler and Kevin James which will bring out comic relief.Count Dracula , whose wife was murdered by human beings, tries to protect his daughter by building a hotel just for vampires , were-wolf , mummies to create his own dark world. However, a wanderer enters the hotel premises and changes the rule of hotel and falls in love with Dracula's daughter.Hotel Transylvania is directed by Genndy Tartakovsky and has Adam Sandler and Kevin James playing the key role. The moment you enter the dark, yet fun-loving, world of Hotel Transylvania, you will be in for a rollercoster ride. You will be simply glued into the arena of mummies , Frankestein, werewolves along little cute wolves who are charming and adorable. The concept (orginal screenplay) of Evil vs Good has been shown with moral values that there is no racism when it comes to LOVE. There lots of hilarious scene which will make you laugh a loud until you will get stomach ache. Adam Sandler and Kevin James will make sure that their dialogues delivery will be punching enough to keep engrossed in the film.Overall , a very likable animation and funny moments makes Hotel Transylvania more enjoyable. Excellent 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hotel Transylvania,Pretty good movie I have always loved this movie it's just such a good animated monster movie I recommend it if you haven't watched it al ready the characters are fun too.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Genndy Tartakovsky Original!,"Directed by none other than Genndy Tartakovsky, Hotel Transylvania is one of the best animated movies this year. It basically goes on the lines of Monsters Inc and Paranorman, picturing monsters and ghosts more scared of us, Humans, than vice versa. I am glad I went for this one as I am a true blue Genndy Tartovksy fan. I remember watching countless hours of Samurai Jack & Dexter's Laboratory back in the days. And of course who could forget the Star Wars Clone Wars mini series? Hotel Transylvania stars Adam Sandler as Count Dracula who turns out to be an overprotective father running a Hotel for monsters, completely free of Humans and things go outta control when a human wanders into the castle and falls in love with Dracula's daughter Mavis.Adam Sandler and Andy Samberg got a winning duo going on in this after the horrendous 'Thats my Boy'. The memories of that movie still haunts me than the ghosts from this movie. The most fun had in Hotel Transylvania is seeing their characters together in the screen dishing it off, monster magic against human wit. Other monsters as well were voiced splendidly by Kevin James, David Spades and Jon Lovitz. Among them the very Fantastic-Mr-Fox looking-Werewolf 'Wayne' stood out giving some of the best lines voiced wonderfully by Steve Buscemi. And well, lastly, Selena Gomez as Mavis was just meh.Complemented with some very good music tracks from an assortment of artists the film has a Merry mood throughout. Of course towards the end it gets predictable but still the signature Genndy style was seen all over and being a fan I loved it all. I found the scenes where Drac goes postal kinda weird. I don't know how the kids took itbut have to admit it was a wee bit disturbing amidst all the jovial stuff that was going on around. So was all the floating Drac thing.Its a hardcore kids movie but it never says anywhere that an adult cant enjoy the same. I really found my 9 year old self enjoying it way too much. Had I seen it at least 10 years back I would have loved it even more. Though seems a sequel is in the making and I have crossed my fingers for it nonetheless.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
From the maker of Dexter's Lab,"If you're a Genndy Tartakovsky or Adam Sandler fan, or like me, a fan of both - go see Hotel Transylvania! And if you do not know who Genndy Tartakovsky is - you are stupid, you are stupid, and don't forjet, you are stupid!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Waste of Animators,"Hotel Transylvania has occasionally cute moments and intermittently interesting art design (otherwise, it's mostly K-Mart Hallowe'en décor), but the story is trite, hackneyed, cliché, and any other words you can think of that mean: nobody broke a sweat on the script or on the plot. The voices are mostly uninteresting, except for Steve Buscemi, who attracts interest by demonstrating that he was catastrophically miscast as the Werewolf. The film is also aimed at a very, very young age group, something you might not understand from seeing the trailer, which makes the film seem about 10 times more sophisticated than it actually is. If you've got little kids, take 'em. If you don't, you'll fall asleep about halfway through the opening credits. If you do go, DO NOT spring the extra bucks for the 3D version. There's about as much 3D here as there is on your average Etch-A-Sketch.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Three howls out of 5,"(3D viewing) Frantic, kid-friendly, pleasantly oddball CGI-mishmash supervised by comedian/producer Adam Sandler can't quite be labeled as either steadily charming (the expensive voice cast--with the possible exception of Steve Buscemi portraying a flat-headed, rolling-eyed werewolf--appears to be trying too hard, mostly force-fit together by voice editing and constantly abrupt scene transitions) or profoundly unearthly (the monsters deal more in competitive magic and mesmerism than spoofing outright terror). But as Sandler's ingratiating, widowed, porcelain-skinned Dracula successfully weans his teenage daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) past puberty into her 118th birthday, the cruise-ship-type monster revelry at his Hotel Transylvania resort castle is invaded for the first time by a dreaded, freckle-faced backpacking American mortal, Jonathan (Andy Samberg), who manages to fascinate and charm Mavis into the threat of an actual monster/human romance. Film's middle--as Dracula 'trains' Jonathan into masquerading as a monster to deflect suspicion or anti-human bigotry from Hotel's labyrinth number of creature-guests while hopefully wearing down Mavis' earnest new attraction--isn't narratively smooth but does feature the requisite 'wild' chases, adolescent and familial longings, and character contortions & gesticulations expected of these computer animated films nowadays. Director & former 2D/Cartoon Network animator Genndy Tartakovsky doesn't reinvent the wheel here, and the almost infinitely detailed digital texture mapping on display is second to no one else's. One does have to wonder however if/why either Sandler or Tartakovsky agreed to keep the film's rubbery interpersonal relations, character massings/groupings used solely for punch lines, and juvenile societal identities set rather low even for contemporary animated features (perhaps to avoid the overly melodramatic lecturing some kids' features descend into, if indirectly.) The climax--where a remorseful, fruit-bat-looking Dracula chases down a home-bound, jet-planed Jonathan to bring him back to Mavis and everyone at the resort--provides enough final giggles/smiles to make HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA a genial, occasionally very-well-imaged animated comedy entertainment that--although it may not have gone far enough for real literature-based horror fans or animation critics--will probably be in serious rotation in your minivan DVD player or kid's playroom TV.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Really Good Nostalgic Trip,"This used to be a favorite of mine growing up, and since a 4th film is unfortunately coming out, I decided to give the 1st and 2nd films a rewatch since that is definately where this series peaked.I'll give this film credit where it's due. It's not the best. Some jokes feel like they are forced and don't really sit well. In addition, some of the animation looks weird at times. It's Sony's usual wacky animation so it's pretty good, but doesn't stand up to the animation of the greats such as Disney.However, the amount of lore this film has makes me wish it was explored in later films and not just to be broken (such as the 'zing' lore being broken in the 3rd movie just to create a selling point). The Drac Pack are great together and it makes me wish they did more together. The second half of the movie and the first 15 minutes are great as it shows so much character interaction, and I love how the hotel looks too, really wish we saw more of it.In terms of story... it's mediocre. I don't understand some points to it but it's simply just there for plot. Basically, the story is about Dracula trying to keep his daughter and friends safe by building a hotel. It's a sweet but corny story and it gives me so much nostalgia. It's a shame they really watered down this series to it's bare minimum though, there's so much that could have been done with it!Personally, I do enjoy this film and I'll watch it as a comfort movie for nostalgia! It's message is really sweet and I do recommend checking this one out.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cute little flick,"Starting out rather generic, but soon turning into a rather sweet and goofy little romp- Hotel Transylvania is a pleasant enough little animated flick that may not get everything right, but does just enough to satisfy. Of course I remember enjoying this film as a kid, but I had no idea why. I hardly remembered anything about this one in particular, rather the lazy sequels that are and were far more advertised than this one. But thankfully, only a little bit of that can be seen here, and it's mostly within the films setup- a rather bland and predictable little set of events which eventually lead into our plot and a much better film altogether. Of course the film has some predictable moments, its script is still a bit formulaic, but it's entertaining enough to be enjoyable- not to mention it's often funny nature and fun animation style. I'm even surprised to say that this film tugged at my heartstrings a little, providing some rather sweet and touching moments that had me tearing up a bit- which is a little shameful to say- but true nevertheless. It just feels like a really fun time, from its stacked voice cast and exuberant animation style- and its constant tongue and cheek humor that more often than not really works. Hell, even Sandler actually gave a good performance as Dracula this time around, not to mention Selena Gomez as Mavis, and my personal favorite- Andy Samberg as Johnny. In the end, Hotel Transylvania may not be the best animated flick to come out of Sony Pictures animation but it is a charming and fun little flick that does just enough to stand out among the many monster themed exploits for kids this Halloween season.My Rating: 7.3/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Adorable for families and any who love old monster tales,"I tend to never side with most critics because they tend to always be negative about everything.Hotel Transylvania is a fun watch for anyone who has a family or if they love all the old monster tales. Of course it is full of clichés because that is the entire point! It is the old clichés that made Dracula and all the monsters who they are and if you don't find the enjoyment in that then it is your loss.It is also fun to listen to the usual Adam Sandler crowd doing monster voices, especially Sandler himself who does a great job playing Dracula.There are tons of Christmas cartoons in the world and not enough Halloween cartoons that kids can enjoy as well as adults and I feel this one is perfect for this season.The animation is also beautiful.I recommend this to anyone who loves the clichés and anyone who can let down their annoying tough ""nothing is original"" front and just enjoys a good laugh!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Better Than Expected!,"Hotel Transylvania is actually a decent family film and that is something I never expected to say considering that this is an Adam Sandler film. But yes, it's a decent family film that has colorful animation, a good story to tell and one that will bring out the kids in adults, has some funny moments, has a solid voice cast, and has some good moral themes.This film is the debut for director Genndy Tartakovksy and not a bad debut at all. This film reunites all our favorite monsters such as Dracula, Frankenstein, and the Mummy in a kid-friendly way. Dracula has created a hotel for monsters in order to avoid humans. Dracula's daughter is celebrating her 118th birthday and that is when she will meet a human boy for the very first time....This film boasts a colorful voice cast and they seemed to have a fun time. It's rare for Adam Sandler to foray into animation and children films at the same time, but he actually does a good job here. His usual friends such as Kevin James, David Spade, and Andy Samberg are here as well.Overall, this is a film that surprisingly, both adults and children should both like. It's nothing special, but it's not the disaster people were predicting. It's funny despite several lame jokes(looking at you bleh, bleh, bleh.) It aims to be a good family movie and it certainly achieves that goal. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Genndy Tartakovsky and some ""SNL"" veterans provide much clever humor in Hotel Transylvania","This is the first feature animated movie directed by Genndy Tartakovsky. I knew of him previously from his work on Cartoon Network's ""Samurai Jack"" which I remember being quite amused by. So now he's made this computer-animated one about Dracula and his daughter and his attempts to keep her from encountering some humans since he's very much prejudiced against them which gets a good explanation as the film goes on. I'll stop there and just say how funny and touching the whole thing was which wasn't surprising since not only was Tartakovsky involved but a lot of former ""SNL""ers which not only included co-writer Robert Smigel but also the voices of Adam Sandler, Molly Shannon, Jon Lovitz, Andy Samberg, and Chris Parnell. Oh, and one of my favorite lines concerns how the Dracula character is appalled by how some people think his kind says ""Bla, bla, bla"". How hilarious! Okay, so on that note, I highly recommend Hotel Transylvania.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Simply fantastic,"Sadly, I didn't watch this film in theaters. When I saw the trailer, I became excited -I grew up watching old classic black-and-white horror movies with Dracula, the werewolf, Frankenstein, the invisible man, the mummy etc- but as soon as I saw that Adam Sandler was in the cast, I turned away. I let my dislike of Sandler get in the way of watching this extraordinary film. Luckily, I found it -albeit a few months later- and it's easily among my favorite animated films. It's smart enough for adult audiences and yet, still has that ability to nurture and cultivate one's imagination. Thank you for the laughs and the tears and the wonder, Hotel Transylvania!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A good film that consolidated Sony's place as a great animation studio, but that still has problems to solve.","This film is one of the best that Sony Pictures Animation has made, finally putting it at the level of Disney, Pixar or Dreamworks. These four giants of animated films have been fighting for a long time. Sony has so far been the most discreet and least successful competitor, however, with this film and the ensuing franchise, the studio has finally managed to show its worth.The script is simple: after losing his wife in a confrontation with violent humans, the secular Count Dracula hides, with his daughter Mavis, in an isolated castle, protected from the humans eyes. To make it profitable, it turns it into a large hotel specially designed to welcome other monsters and creatures that want distance from people. But, as the centuries go by, Mavis has grown up and wants to finally see the world beyond the immense dark forest that surrounds the castle. And that is what Dracula is most afraid of, as he regards human beings as highly dangerous.The film was perfectly capable of humanizing and giving a funny touch to the monsters that we get used to seeing in horror films. Dracula, the Mummy, the Werewolf, Quasimodo, the Invisible Man, Frankenstein's monster, Bigfoot... they're all here, and all of them much more human and lovable than they could be in another kind of film. The plot rests on the father-daughter relationship, on the way a father tries to protect his daughter until eventually she feels suffocated and revolts against it. The most comical scenes are reserved for the Count, especially when he plays with Jonathan, the human teenager who, against all odds, finds the castle and decides to explore it. The dialogues are excellent and the humour is everywhere.The direction is ensured by Genndy Tartakovsky, who previously collaborated with Cartoon Network Chanel, where he was responsible for some of their most iconic animated shows. It is, therefore, an interesting bet that worked very well. The voice actors cast is large and very good, with the veteran Adam Sandler and Selena Gomez at the head. Everyone did their job very well and fit the characters perfectly. I found Sandler's effort to make his voice more Romanian especially interesting, although it might not be necessary.Technically, the film is based on computer animation and CGI, whose quality seemed somewhat irregular but generally good. Unlike the films from other studios, music and songs are far from being the strong point here... in fact, it was one of the weakest bets in this film, with forgettable songs that seem to be there only because they have to be there, without being able to add quality and joy to the film. The ending, where music plays a predominant role, ends up a little blurred because of that.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Proof not every animated movie has to strive to be Pixar,"The Hotel Transylvania movies are some of the most fun cartoony animated movies. The animation is very reminicent of cartoon shows like Tom & Jerry, or Looney Tunes. Characters are animated in exaggerated ways and makes the movies really entertaining to watch.I love most Pixar movies, but they never really deal with cartoony action. This movie does it really well and has a pretty weird sense of humor. This sense of humor makes it extremely watchable by adults. It has a few of the ""jokes kids won't get because they're not old enough"", but it doesn't rely on them. It just has really a creative sense of humor that is clever.Sandler is surprisingly amazing in this as I forget it's him doing Dracula. His usual movie pack also does well and really shows you they do have comedy talent when not stuck in Sandler's awful live action movies.What really makes this work besides the sense of humor is the story. It has heart and really keeps you invested in the movie. The characters are really well done and the family aspect of Drac and Mavis gives this movie so much depth.I'm glad there is a creative team making animated movies like this. It's not the same level as Pixar, but it's really funny and creative in it's own way. It's miles above any of the Despicable Me movies and non-Dragon/Panda Dreamworks movies. It's sad that the series plot wise has kind of gone downhill, but it's sense of humor has still stuck strong and make each movie worth a watch just for that and the cartoony animation.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A real pleasure to watch.,"I was very lucky to have had the oppprtunity to watch this movie with a good friend of mine, both of us laughed throughout the film and we are both in our early 30s. The movie may be orientated towards children but honestly anyone can enjoy it. The movie tells the story of Count Dracula and his daughter Mavis. Its a coming of age story that sees Mavis wanting to out into the world for the first time while her farther due bad events of the past goes to extreme lengths to stop her from doing so. The story is set during Mavis' 118 birthday and all kinds of monsters and creatures appear at the hotel for the celebration. They are amazingly animated and full of distinct vibrant personalities, some of the monsters include Frankensteins' monster, The Yeti and Werewolves to name but a few..... During the party a young human named Jonathan arrives who shakes things with Mavis and the Monsters. Its pleasure to watch it all play out even though coming of age stories generally play out the same way. However this one is unique due to its setting.The voice acting amazing. Dracula played by Adam Sandler, I didn't even recognize his voice. When I think of his voice in other movies. Selena Gomez done a great job as Mavis. Voice acting isn't as easy you might think. Dubbing in a lot of foreign films tends to be very bad. So I'm glad such a good animated film chose talented actors and actresses. Much praise has to go to the animators for a viusally beautiful film to look at.So overall 9/10. You'd be hardpressed to find a better animated film.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Probably not good for the 4 and younger crowd,"My husband and I took our kids to see this last night. The girls (5 and 7), my husband and I really enjoyed it and laughed throughout the whole thing. There were plenty of jokes that the kids got and there were some that went over their heads but had my husband and I laughing.My son (3) however, was not amused. He got terrified by a scene in the beginning where it looks like people are on fire and trying to kill a girl. It ruined the whole thing for him and he asked to leave about 25 times after that. As soon as the credits started rolling, he jumped out of his seat and started heading up the aisle out of the theater. And he said ""I didn't like that scary movie"" over and over on the drive home. He isn't a kid that is scared of much. The only thing I can think of would be the ""scary bear"" in Brave (and he wasn't scared of that nearly as much because he LOVED that movie and made us go back to the theater and see it a second time). Otherwise he's seen almost every kids movie (new and old) I can think of and hasn't been scared of any of them.Do with that information what you will. I just felt like it was something other parents might be wondering so I thought I'd share our experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It had a lot of potential...,"I saw this earlier today, and I was a bit underwhelmed. The film certainly has an interesting premise - it's the relatively unused ""monsters are afraid of humans"" bit we saw in Monsters, Inc., though not handled nearly as well.The film tries to be a comedy, and fails in that regard. There are one or two memorable jokes, but most of the humor is relegated firmly to the ""fart joke"" territory. There's also the mandatory awful musical number at the end which serves no purpose but to remind you that the creators were aiming this at children and only children (I actually got up and left the theater at this point).However, my biggest gripe with the film was the total lack of pacing. Not in the story, but in the animation. Visually, everything just moves way too fast on the screen. The animators seem to have absolutely no sense of timing for comic effect - while you're still trying to work out the previous visual gag, the next one has already come and gone. Maybe you'd have to see it to understand my meaning, but the animation just needs to slow the hell down. That alone might have saved this movie.That said, the film *does* have some redeeming qualities. Most have criticized the story as being too cliché or predictable, and while it was to an extent, it didn't bother me. I found Mavis's character and her relationship with Dracula to be one of the more compelling aspects of the film, and I can't help but feel like they would have ended up with a better movie if they'd focused on this more and left the fart jokes at the door (though admittedly, not one that would appeal to little kids).Unless you're really itching for something new to see, I probably wouldn't spend the money, though I suppose it's also not the *worst* vampire movie coming out this year...",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Your children will like it!,"The reason why I say that your children will like it is that my ten year old little friend really loves it.

For this movie, I am sure he loves it as usually he probably has fallen asleep at 22:30. However that day we projected this animation for him, he stayed up to the end which is 23:30. And he was still very excited talking about the plot in the picture.It is undeniable that this is a interesting animation no matter from the way the characters talk or the story. I think each successful animation cannot be there without those good voices of characters. For this one I would vote it a perfect voice play, the voices are all what they exactly are, what their personalities exactly are and they really touch your heart. Lots of conversations are so funny that even adult like me can be moved by them.In addition, it doesn't forget to beg some tears from audiences, of course, it's because of movement rather than sadness. There are some plays can make me burst into teas, it is really overwhelming. At least, if you will cry when you see a athlete flies the flag for your country in Olympic, you will must be moved by this one.Anyway, it to some extent worth you to spend time and money to have a look.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Loved The movie!,"I loved this movie so much that for the first time in my life i am writing a review for a movie. For all the time i watched this movie it was totally worth it for reasons discussed above. First, I really liked it when the movie made me realize that parents matter a lot and they love you very much and try to do whats best for you. Second thing i saw this movie with my small sister and she loved it very much. Third thing the characters of this movie are really dynamic and inspiring they made me laugh most of the time, i really can't forget moments of this movie. This is because I really haven't seen a good movie in almost 2 months as really crappy movies are being made these days but they shouldn't be discussed here. I'd recommend you to watch this movie with subtitles and you will have a lot of fun trust me!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Would only recommend if you have nothing else to watch.,"We watched with my husband ""Hotel Transylvania"" yesterday, thinking it would be a funny and easy movie. I think I laughed at just 1-2 points. We both got kinda bored halfway through the movie but kept watching it nevertheless. The idea and the story was nice but the whole movie is just a fast paced thing that I felt didn't give us a second of peace to breathe and think and enjoy what was going on. It just tired me. Graphics are good, voices so and so (but that is just a personal opinion), music/songs nothing special. So no, I wouldn't watch it again and neither will I recommend it to anyone I know. It's not terrible it's just that I feel there are so many other movies that I would recommend instead of this.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"visualization, graphics become my eye-soother","Count Dracula runs Hotel Transylvania in a dark, ghastly forest far away from the human world to protect his sole daughter from humans. The hotel is also treated as a merry zone for other monsters as they, along with their family, come every year to celebrate the daughter's birthday. The Dexter's Lab-creator, Taratakovsky keeps his splendid direction immune to make my time blithe :p The visualization, graphics become my eye-soother. Voice-sync, pop ostz, other classic horror characters like Frankenstein, Invisible Man, Wayne---all can not stalemate my mirth for a single moment :p The story also fantasizes me with immense fun and slight emotional turn :p Nevertheless, my joy-scale could contrast to other ratings; it still earns from me 9/10___:)))",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Decent film, but not hugely impressive","I had heard a lot about this one being good, so I decided to watch it but was rather underwhelmed. Most of all what kind of bothered me was the constant happy-cheery-jokey kind of stuff going on. I get that the target audience is young children, but I don't think that necessarily means you need to make everything so silly and cheesy. I've seen a lot of really great children's movies that were more serious (though still age-appropriate of course) and only had the occasional funny bit. Especially considering the monster theme, I did not expect this level of silly and cheesy.And while on the topic of the monster theme, that's another thing that kind of bugged me. Maybe I'm just stuck up, I don't know, but it bothers me when creators take too much of a creative liberty with established classical characters or beings/creatures, or in some cases they just got things wrong (like the oh so typical case of calling the monster Frankenstein when that's in fact the name of the man who made him, that's a massive pet peeve of mine, and just generally making his character entirely wrong). I suppose I just prefer more old- fashioned monsters. And... Why is Quasimodo not human, and more importantly, why is he some sort of crazy fiery chef??? Speaking of which, Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame is a pretty good example of how a movie for children can still be pretty dark and serious without CONSTANT comic relief.Overall the movie is not awful or anything, not at all, but much too goofy, over-the-top, predictable to a ridiculous extent, and not very ""authentic"" with its monsters. I'd say it has too much of a modern tone as well, if that makes any sense. This could have been so much better if the creators had the courage to be more unique.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"role choice, not sure","the movie was pretty good, but i will say it right off Adam Sandler sucked as Dracula, it was not the right roll, the personality and voice of the Dracula was not believable at all. he would have made a great addition but not the lead. his voice is to common in relation to his other roles. its a kids movie but its still also very cheesy was OK to watch but as a adult with a child it would be been nice to have some more underline jokes. how quickly Mavis fell for Jonathan was a little silly it went from 0-9 in one scene. kinda enjoyed the side story's more then the main one. the animation was really well done a lot of depth and render in the images.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A very unique animated film about all the famous monsters through history!,"Hotel Transylvania is the story of Dracula(Adam Sandler), who is so overprotective about his daughter, Mavis(Selena Gomez) that he starts the luxury hotel called Hotel Transylvania to protect his daughter from humans. The hotel also works as a luxurious escapade for all famous supernatural creatures like, Frankenstein(Kevin James), The Invisible Man(David Spade) & so on. In comes free spirited human, Jonathan(Andy Samberg) who accidentally barges into the hotel thinking it's just like any other hotel. However, Dracula can't have a human in his hotel, so, he makes Jonathan dress up like the Frankenstein telling all the hotel guests that he is Frankenstein's cousin, Johnny Stein. From here on, hilarity ensues.Hotel Transylvania is one of the funniest movies I've watched in recent times. It's also so unique! How often do you come across a movie which portrays ghosts & monsters as good & humans as bad?! Never! It's been directed by Genndy Tartakovsky, the creator of such awesome cartoons as The Powerpuff Girls, Dexter's Laboratory & Samurai Jack. No wonder it's so good! The voice acting is brilliant. Adam Sandler is mind blowing as Dracula. He's done the weird vampire accent & everything! Selena Gomez is great as Drac's daughter, Mavis. However, the standout for me is, Andy Samberg as Jonathan/Johnny Stein. We owe 99% of the funniness in this movie, to him! Kevin James as Frankenstein, David Spade as Griffin- The Invisible Man, & all the other supporting characters are brilliant as well. So, I would like to conclude by saying, Hotel Transylvania is a must watch for anyone looking to have a great time at the movies!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"I found it dull, but kids may like it","While a few witty jokes made me laugh, the film relied a bit too much on slapstick humor for my taste. Constantly watching characters fall and panic and scream and run around aimlessly started to wear me down. There to many scenes of mindless visual and audio noise that might be riveting for children, but boring for adults. At least the animation is pretty good and full of clever ideas.The story is not very compeling, as it seems the writers focused on packing the movie with visual gags to the detriment of character development. The main characters acted in a nonsensical way that ruined the emotional value of important scenes, quickly making me lose interest in the plot.Overall this is a harmless but highly forgettable kids movie that I would not recommend for adults.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Blah! Blah! Blah!,"To be perfectly honest I have to admit that this put me to sleep and I missed a good chunk of it. We were looking for a family movie to watch with our daughter. I had heard good things about this, our daughter (who's 8) had mentioned wanting to see it, so we rented it. She may have enjoyed it. She laughed a handful of times and, as far as I know, she stayed awake. Frankly, it did nothing for me.It was rather frenetic at the beginning - too much so for my liking. It struck me as being sort of Monsters, Inc. after drinking one too many Red Bulls. The story (of Dracula as an overprotective father wanting to protect his daughter from the outside world) was paper thin. The reversal of roles was a bit cute. In this, the monsters are hidden away from the real world because they're afraid of humans. It was pretty obvious where this was going to go, so there was little to really hold my interest.Altogether, I found this disappointing. I can't completely write it off, because my daughter did laugh that handful of times, but I'd still say that it was much weaker than I was hoping for. (3/10)",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

This was a delight – with music – and even the music was pretty good. Got to say this is probably the only thing I've ever liked Fran Drescher or David Spade in. Seriously.

An interesting re-imagining of Dracula,"After the death of his wife, Count Dracula became an overprotective father, determined to do whatever he could to keep his daughter Mavis safe from the cruel human world. So he built a big castle which he named Hotel Transylvania, a place for every monster who wanted to stay away from humans. Everything goes according to plan until an actual person accidentally enters the hotel, bringing a lot of problems to Dracula who must act fast in order not to compromise his sacred place (and of course the wellbeing of Mavis).It's an interesting story with monsters, full of funny moments and excitement. We see how a human can dramatically change a world which monsters considered safe and the life of Dacula's own daughter. It's very good looking, very well animated and it has some outstanding music. It had some awkward moments scattered along the way which seemed a bit out of place but it's overall a very good movie. Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

The characters effectively blend into the context and the plot, which is simple, but in the end serves as a framework for the comic situations between Dracula and the human.Great movie to watch and have fun with the family.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Family Fun at 'Hotel Transylvania',"""I am so happy to see a Halloween movie that is actually for everyone,"" says KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Morgan Bertsch, age 7 (who also attended the animated film's red carpet event and interviewed Jon Lovitz and other stars whose voices ""appear"" in it). Hotel Transylvania is full of monsters that are unfriendly toward humans, of course – after all, what are monsters for? Even in the childhood classics from Grimm – but our KIDS FIRST! youth film critics find it a fun entertainment for this Halloween season. ""I love the creative designs on how they make all the monsters to be nice and fluffy instead of mean and scary. The voices are brilliant; the special effects are so awesome,"" says Cheyenne Nguyen. And Anthony Aranda puts it succinctly, ""This movie is awesome because it has lots of funny parts and has action, too."" Parents (and kids, too) can relate to Dracula's struggles as a parent, trying to shield his daughter from the unpleasantness and dangers that life may throw at her. She is, after all, only 118 years old!Hotel Transylvania Reviewed by Cheyenne Nguyen Interviews with Talent here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iVm_y3L6dI Video Review here. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIkrr8pkLgw Hotel Transylvania is super hilarious and this movie lets us see how humans are viewed by monsters. The plot in this movie is the overprotective-father-and-his-teenage- daughter relationship and ZING at first sight. Dracula (Adam Sandler) runs Hotel Transylvania, a castle known to be completely cut off from humans. On his daughter Mavis' (Selena Gomez) 118th birthday, he invites his monster friends — such as the Mummy (CeeLo Green), Frankenstein (Kevin James), Griffin the Invisible Man (David Spade) — to come and celebrate. However, his party is very predictable and boring. Mavis is now 118 years old and wants to experience the world and does not want to be in a kiddie's birthday party. Mavis is not having any fun at her own party. However, the party begins when a backpacking human named Jonathan (Andy Samberg) accidentally stumbles into the castle. My favorite part of this movie is when Dracula slashes out at his friends and point out all the annoying things for each monster and they are all offended. The truth is not very pretty sometimes. However, it does have many feel-good moments in his tantrum. The quality of the 3-D in this movie is awesome; you can see all the details of the monsters popping right in front of you! I jumped out of my seat several times. I love the creative designs on how they make all the monsters to be nice and fluffy instead of mean and scary. The voices are brilliant; the special effects are so awesome. The message in this movie is not to judge anyone until you get to know them. The only part I did not like is how the monsters view the humans as fat and mean. My favorite character is Jonathan. He is so fun to be around and always focuses on the good side of people or monsters. I rank this movie four out of five stars (due to some scary parts). I give this age ranged 5 and up.For more reviews on Hotel Transylvania, go to kidsfirst.org",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

A tangled mess of characters in parent-knows-best animation.,"HERE'S another animation about parents doing the thinking for their children. In Brave, a mum and and her teen daughter argue about whom the latter will marry.In Hotel Transylvania, Dracula dad (voiced by Adam Sandler) does his best to keep his teen daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez), from stepping out into the real world or, horrors, falling in love with a human.The main thing that you'll remember after watching this high-quality production but low-quality joke fest is the chaos that permeates it.Director Genndy Tartakovsky hits you with everything he can, including weird and cuddly characters, such as werewolf Wayne (Steve Buscemi in that whiny voice of his), Invisible Man (David Spade), mummy Murray (CeeLo Green) and Frank the Frankenstein (Kevin James). There are also characters voiced by Molly Shannon, Fren Drescher and Jon Lovitz.There's so much going on that viewers will have a hard time focusing on anyone or anything. But, not to worry, you get your usual dose of fart jokes, as per required in a Sandler movie.Sandler's Dracula is so over the top with his unusual European accent that you wished he'd stuck to English.Dracula plans his daughter's 118th birthday party to welcome her into adulthood and invites monsters of all kinds to the party at his hidden castle. He, surprisingly, allows her to visit a nearby village, but what she doesn't know is that he built it and his underlings disguised themselves to look like humans out to torch her.His antipathy towards humans isn't explained initially, but it's later revealed that humans burnt down a castle, which killed his wife but spared their daughter.A bushy haired and gangling backpacking teen, Jonathan (Andy Samberg), chances upon the hotel and makes himself a menace there, but he and Mavis hit it off immediately, forcing the father to execute anti- falling-in-love-with-human measures.Mavis embraces Jonathan's nomadic lifestyle, and is touched by his visit to the Taj Mahal, built by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his third wife.While funny events are rare in Hotel Transylvania, there are some well- crafted scenes that you wished the movie had more of, for example, the table-raising chase scene between Dracula and Jonathan, and a couple of live band performances.The movie's conclusion is that humans and monsters can get over their fear of each other and learn to get along well.www.jeffleemovies.com",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

While it may be about monsters and scariness, it is very colorful, with a wonderful assortment of characters. While it was loads of fun, it did have its dramatic moments, helping it all the more.

Bloodless and toothless kiddie faire,"With its plot lifted shamelessly from ""Finding Nemo"" and its overly familiar standard Halloween-mask characters, the basics of ""Hotel Transylvania"" pose no threat to the younger set and no challenge for anyone older. Dialog and plot development match the toothless motif with a big, friendly daddy Dracula defends his monsters-only hotel a la John Cleese in the old British ""Fawlty Towers"" television show (or ""programme"") and tries to keep his daughter from coming of age. The main plot follows precisely the sequence you expect from this premise with the characters growing and coming to terms right on cue. The big name voice actors (Sandler, Samberg, Gomez, etc.) appropriately phone it in given a lack of interesting dialog or witty one-liners. The animation style brings us a lot of warm colors but no technical virtuosity. In short, a non-offensive essential neutral time killer for the five to ten year old set.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Apparently, I was busy with college courses, but at least I saw it on-demand, and let me tell you, it was better than DESPICABLE ME! This was the MAD MONSTER PARTY of 2012. I mean we got Dracula, the Frankenstein Monster, his bride, the Mummy, the Wolf-man (who has a wife and a litter of kids), the Invisible Man, Quasimodo (a.k.a. The Hunchback of Notre Dame), Mr, Hyde,The Fly and plenty of gill-men, witches, skeletons, zombies, big feet (plural for bigfoot) and a few mythological creatures thrown in here and there such as the Hydra, cyclops and the minotaur. It is great fun (for the family that is). I love the character designs there because it is totally his style. There is a lot of celebrity voice talent going on there. Being someone who watched DEXTER'S LABORATORY religiously, I noticed some certain trademarks that got recycled into it. If you are someone who watched a lot of episodes, then take a look. Genddy is no monster-kid like George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Peter Jackson or Tim Burton. He grew up on cartoons. Now one more thing, I heard that his next project is going to be POPEYE. I am excited to hear that because I grew up on POPYEYE. If Genndy Taratovsky grew up on Popeye, the I am sure he won't mess this up. I can understand that. Because all this Popeye merchandising is popping around here and there. We got clothes, toys, and a comic book reboot, so yeah, I think Popeye DESERVES to have a come-back.

Hotel Transylvania is a fun family film that's creative and heartwarming,"My daughter and I recently rewatched Hotel Transylvania (2012) on Netflix. The storyline follows Dracula and his daughter, who run a hotel far away from humans, who killed his wife. As the daughter grows up, she becomes curious about humans, but Dracula will stop at nothing to keep her sheltered. As she looks to spread her wings and learn about the world, Dracula must decide if it's in their best interest to let her explore or keep her confined to their hotel for monsters.This film is directed by Genndy Tartakovsky (Samurai Jack) and features the voices of Adam Sandler (Happy Gilmore), Kevin James (Paul Blart: Mall Cop), Selena Gomez (Spring Breakers), Fran Drescher (The Nanny), and Steve Buscemi (Fargo).This movie hits on just about every level-excellent animation, a fun depiction of the monster universe, and perfectly selected voices. The dynamics between the father, daughter, and her boyfriend are perfectly illustrated and keep a smile on your face. The comedic content is a nice blend of clever and cheesy. The scream cream always makes me happy. The mother subplot is sad but compelling. The soundtrack is solid, and the conclusion is worthwhile.In conclusion, Hotel Transylvania is a fun family film that's creative and heartwarming.

The characters are horrible (perhaps it is not an exaggeration to say that Jonathan is one of the most embarrassing and irritating characters in the world who was born on the screen by the imagination), the story is the antithesis of drama because it is so infantile that it discredits itself at every moment, and the rap piece of the closing concert with Adam Sandler... just kill me now!

"Unsubstantial Fluff, but Should Please Kids","In a groundbreaking (and diverse) age of animation where Disney is no longer the sole juggernaut, competing houses Pixar, DreamWorks, Aardman, Laika and Studio Ghibli (and to a lesser extent Fox's Blue Sky Studios) continually offer audiences compelling fare that often break any preconceived notions that this overarching genre is simply for children.Struggling to find its foothold in the industry as DreamWorks once did is Sony Pictures Animation, purveyor of fare including Open Season and The Smurfs – an entity which seems decidedly stuck in the past. Offering up slapstick-laden fluff of the lowest common denominator, the products flowing from this studio (even at their most comforting and brisk) are insubstantial and almost always offer nothing but a fleeting diversion.Hotel Transylvania is a chief offender when it comes to all the issues plaguing mainstream animation today and in a number of ways seems like a significant step back from the frisky energy boasted from 2009's Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs. At the very least that well-received film had the audacity to adapt a tricky children's novel, whereas this Adam Sandler-led vehicle seems as archaic as the gloomy manor in which this film is set.However, not to be a complete ogre (a creature which ironically does not make an appearance amongst the mummies, gremlins and more famous monsters and ghouls), Hotel Transylvania does not even seem to be reaching for anything beyond mediocrity and seems simply intent on pleasing a young audience for 90 minutes – a basic merit I cannot entirely dismiss.Hotel Transylvania is not offensively bland and frankly, the easy-going nature of the production is likely to please its target demographic while keeping accompanying parents rooted in their seats (this is no ""Oogieloves,"" or so I can surmise).Sidestepping the inconsequential nature of Hotel Transylvania's execution, a significant failing of the film comes via the misleading trailers which essentially play out as a bait and switch. The promotional material promises a comedy of errors whereby a human stumbles upon a retreat for the fantastical. Hilarity would hopefully ensure as Adam Sandler's Dracula tries to hide the true nature of his abode (and its many odd residents).However, that portion of the film plays out almost immediately and what we're left with is the well-worn overprotective parent story as the hotel's newcomer falls for the famed vamp's daughter, Mavis. Adding a level of creepiness to the whole ordeal (and I don't mean of the horror variety) is that Mavis is 118 years old and is essentially being kept in solitude by her father. Freud, eat your heart out.That central plot thread of Hotel Transylvania is hopelessly clichéd and so overdone it adds yet another layer of dust to this proverbial dinosaur of a movie. One could name a few dozen films in a matter of seconds that utilize that trope as its driving comedic force and alas it's not even the first animated flick of the year to do so. Pixar's Brave also employed the overbearing (at points literally ""over-bearing"") parent shtick and unsurprisingly it turned out to be one of the weakest and most insubstantial entries in the studio's canon. Hotel Transylvania with its simplified animation, less successful humor and weaker voice cast is another step down on that disappointment.With the aforementioned voice cast, an impressive line-up has nevertheless been assembled. Sandler is the classical Transylvanian blood-sucker – velcome! – Selena Gomez his daughter and the guests attending her birthday include Andy Samberg (as the human presence) Kevin James, Steve Buscemi, David Spade, Jon Lovitz, Rob Riggle, Fran Drescher and Cee lo Green. Samberg is among the funnier of the bunch and nobody does Buscemi quite like Buscemi, but regardless of the talent on hand, there is not a memorable performance between them. Nobody is offensively awful but when the material isn't failing themOK the material fails them.Bah, but enough with the hate as this is not in fact a scathing review and as a whole Hotel Transylvania does not make the damning sin of being boring, it certainly proves Sandler is capable of starring in a movie not of the atrocious variety. There are a number of jokes in David I. Stern's screenplay that hit home (even when you can see them coming) and there is something charming about seeing all these creatures share the screen in a cheery monster mash-up. It's like a more comedic The Expendables done via The Brothers Grimm.When all is said and done, Hotel Transylvania is inoffensive fluff that will be better served in a home video capacity than it ever will on the big screen. There is simply no ""must see"" element to this film. A little too noisy and a lot too bland, Sandler and co. should be able to please nearly every child in the audience but will never have the power to pull the child out of an older crowd.5.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Best Adam Sandler movie!,"I'm skeptical to like anything by Adam Sandler, but my hope went up when I found that none other than Genndy Tartakovsky was directing this film. He was a big part of my childhood with cartoons like ""Dexter's Laboratory"" and ""Samurai Jack"". Now, I know it's hard to make the transition to CGI, but he made it just fine. It's a pity that this movie didn't do too well with critics, although it still got a much higher score than most of Adam Sandler's movies. Tartakovsky is what makes this movie. What stands out as the best parts are probably how beautifully animated this film is. The colors are gorgeous and there's so much movement.I keep hearing there's lots of hidden things in this, but I didn't see most of them. I'm normally not a fan of celebrity voices, but it was done well here, especially considering the sheer number of bad movies of any kind these actors have been in. While I praise the film for being wacky, I really did get the emotional bits in it. There's lots of great jokes of course. I admit that some parts of it aren't that good. It's weird how they are so easily accepted into the human world. It's kind of a dues ex machina. I saw the second movie first and I think this one is better, but they're both enjoyable. ***",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing Movie!,"This is a great movie. Cute for both children and parents. I love the story line and the fact it is fromt eh monster's point of view. I love the songs and music in the movie. This is a prefect family friendly movie. This has a great family based storyline.The father (Dracula) is a perfect father. Mavi is such a sweet and amazingly rounded character. It is the perfect snow day or rainy day movie. It captures the attention on everyone watching it, or well it did in my family.Good job tot he actors and actresses that helped make this movie and to the people who brought it all to life. The second movie Hotel Transylvania 2 is also an amazing movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Yawn!,"I made a lot of attempts to get to see this movie; I was so 
 disappointed after 30 minutes in.
 
 I like being surprised by the story a movie delivers, so sometimes 
 instead of reading ahead i just go to the cinema to be surprised. When 
 I found out what the plot was for this movie I felt like shooting 
 myself in the foot for not reading ahead.
 
 Produced by Sony Pictures Animation, Hotel Transylvania has been in 
 development since 2006 with Miley Cyrus penned to play the voice of 
 Mavis (Dracula's daughter), but she later dropped the role and Selena 
 Gomez was given the role instead.
 
 The movie's idea was to paint a scenario typical to that of 
 Pixar/Disney's Monsters Inc, where the monsters were afraid of the 
 humans, although in this twist the humans seems to love the Monsters.
 
 Every movie runs on a typical fuel, Monsters Inc's fuel was they need 
 of screams for their energy, the fuel in this movie is Mavis (Selena 
 Gomez) desire to go to the outside world. This kind of driving force 
 for a movie is too flat based on the fact that the outside world is 
 just outside your door.
 
 The voice casting/acting in this movie is not half as bad as the plot. 
 Adam Sandler voiced Dracula and did a fine job at it too. The movie's 
 plot is about Dracula, who lost his wife to an attack by humans.
 
 Due to that, he built a hotel where the world's monsters can take a 
 rest from human civilization. In his list of invitees we have 1. 
 Frankenstein and his bride 2. Werewolf, his bride and their liter (and 
 may I tell you they have so much) 3. Mummy 4. Skeleton and bride 5. 
 Invisible man 6. And much more.
 
 The movie does try to be funny, with lines like when Dracula told the 
 Invisible man, ""Hello! Great to see you""
 
 The movie director Genndy Tartakovsky is behind the some notable 
 Cartoon Network animated television series, including Dexter's 
 Laboratory, Samurai Jack, Star Wars: Clone Wars, and Sym-Bionic Titan. 
 Genndy will also be directing an animated film based on Popeye.
 
 Hotel Transylvania will have been best as a short movie that was like 
 30 mins long rather than a full length one that has nothing but wasted 
 scenes luring you to an expected end.
 
 But putting it all together if you haven't heard of this movie then be 
 happy, you are not missing a thing.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A funny family halloween movie,"How many times are creatures and monsters ever portrayed in a human like fashion? Not often. As for this movie, it is one of the few who come out of the woodwork and display a sense of creativity, charm and even a life lesson. And to be honest, just from the trailer, it seemed that careful thought was put into making this movie be as good as it is. For his first feature film, director Genndy Tartakovsky's direction in animation and character design have a very unique style. And although this is his first time taking on a movie, he is able to display his talent thoroughly after directing several other animated cartoons like Samurai Jack (2001) & Dexter's Laboratory (1996).The story is about an over protective dad / hotel owner, Count Dracula (Adam Sandler) who only wishes to keep his free spirited daughter Mavis (Selena Gomez) from visiting the outside world. Thankfully, the hotel he has created is what's supposed to keep the outside world from coming in. This allows the Count and his daughter to live safely along with every other monster / creature one could think of that would want to spend time at his hotel. Little does Dracula know that someone from the outside world will come strolling in, a human named Jonathan (Andy Samberg). But when this happens, things turn around for the better.Along with Sandler, Samberg and Gomez are various other popular comedians like Kevin James as Frankenstein, Fran Drescher as Eunice (his wife), Steve Buscemi as Wayne the werewolf, David Spade as the Invisible Man, Ceelo Green as Murray the Mummy and tons more. Together, they make characters so likable that it's hard not to resist them. Again going back to Tartakovsky's direction, the way each character looks, resembles their actors quite proficiently. Compare Dracula and Adam Sandler and you'll understand. Plus, the computer animation is so evenly mixed together that the whole movie will feel like a very smooth ride, which is great.The writing isn't mediocre either. If there's one thing I'll pick at, it's that for a while when Jonathan (Samberg) entered the frame, there seemed to be no break or pause between the dialog which made me feel like the characters were on a sugar rush. It did slow down later on but before that it was moving very quickly, almost to the point where I felt like I wasn't catching everything that was being said. But besides that, I love how the story starts and ends. What's even more interesting is how the story doesn't revolve around Mavis (Gomez) as much I thought it would. Mavis plays an important role but the character development of her father Dracula (Sandler) is what stands out. And to be honest, seeing the character development in Dracula was more gratifying than if he were to take a back seat by the third act.And although the story is cliché in some senses with finding true love and everything is hunky dory at the end, there are two things that must be understood; it's a family movie and that particular part isn't necessary to get upset over for this kind of movie. Along with the actual story, the comedy was also well executed. There are several things people will be able to relate because of how Dracula and his family perceive to handle various situations as us humans would. They even mock at Twilight (2008), talk about breaking the fourth wall huh? The musical score provided by composer Mark Mothersbaugh did a decent job too. I didn't hear a main theme but to be honest, it wasn't needed this time. His music flowed with the movement of the picture and it worked nicely.The animation is smooth, the actors use their voices effectively and the comedy is strong. But what makes it good is its story with an integrated moral lesson.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A First Instalment Animation Film That Could Have Been Better,I completely understand what the crew were thinking and trying to do when they were creating this poor and weak first instalment animation film but it did not work at all. This first instalment animation film is confusing and disappointing and did not make any real sense at all. I feel that this franchise completely changed and ruined the image of some of the characters. The storyline of this first instalment animation film was a bit basic and simple and straightforward and did not have any real direction at all. The cast selection was fairly strong. They did not exactly fully commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters. There was not any sign of real chemistry displayed throughout this first instalment animation film between the cast members.,1.0,Anonymous,Animation

The advertisements were the best part of the movie,I had high expectations for this film but was sadly disappointed. The opportunities for great lines were there but were squandered. It seems that most flicks like this have to have some point to them or a moral or a lesson to learn when no lesson or moral was even necessary. All they had to do was to come up with something funny and run with it but they failed at that.All the best parts of the movie were in the commercial for the movie which left the audience with nothing but popcorn if we happened to buy it. Big disappointment. Since the cast were all cartoon characters you can not blame it on the acting. That means all that's left to blame is in the writing.,3.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Vidiot Reviews,"Hotel TransylvaniaOne of the perks to staying in a hotel for monsters is those tiny bottles of virgin blood they leave in your bathroom.However, owning an inn for inhumans, like the one in this animated feature, holds absolutely no benefit.Built by Dracula (Adam Sandler) as a refuge from civilization, Hotel Transylvania hosts hordes of horrordoms most screamed names, from Wolf Man (Steve Buscemi) and Frankenstein (Kevin James) and their wives (Molly Shannon, Fran Drescher) to the Invisible Man (David Spade) and the Mummy (Cee Lo Green).But when a human (Andy Samberg) shows up, Dracula must not only keep him away from his guests, but also his daughter (Selena Gomez).With more song and dance than these legendary characters should be performing, Hotel Transylvania sucks the scare out of these abominations and replaces it with flatulence.Nonetheless, there's probably fewer murders here than at an actual hotel in Transylvania.(Red Light)vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Terrible,"Let me just say this right up front: I HATE Hotel Transylvania. There are some reasons why.First, Adam Sandler is not a good actor. He does the iconic character of Dracula little to no justice with his unremarkable performance. I'm sorry to say this, but it's true. Second, the puns and jokes are lame and unfunny. Third, the story is not very interesting. The boring storyline of Dracula being overprotective of his daughter, Mavis, has become an irritatingly overused cliche by now. The movie also wastes the talents of Selena Gomez.So..1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Overall good message?,Hotel Transylvania has a good message but contains too many things we have seen in other movies. Particularly when it comes to gender roles and gender stereotypes. We see Mavis wearing lipstick when she is a baby (although maybe this is just a trait of female vampires?) In a film that has a core message that teaches children not to judge others for their actions or for being different. All of the relationships presented in the film are heterosexual relationships. For a movie that was made in 2012 I wish they could have pushed the boundary pertaining to relationships and gender roles within them.,5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Lazy,"I'm sure Adam Sandler is a decent person... so nice his gives his acting friends free paychecks regardless of how bad the projects are. IE Grown Ups... Kevin James, David Spade, Steve Buscemi... I was never the big fan of his work to begin with... I personally thought Spanglish was his best performance.But this Hotel atrocity pushes the envelope to jump the shark in the laziest way possible. I sincerely hope that we're coming to the tail end of his career. I don't know how many people can still tolerate to see the same Adam Sandler project; to the point where studios are convinced that his recycled 40 year old comedy still holds water.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Frighteningly Fun,"This cute fish-out-of-water story centers around Jonathan, a human hiker who stumbles upon Hotel Transylvania, a hotel for monsters, vampires, werewolves, and more run by non other than Count Dracula himself. Trouble ensues when old Dracula's daughter, Mavis meets the human Jonathan, a romance that Dracula will do anything to end.Drawing on the classic set of spooky characters, the writers have a lot of material to work with. What the film becomes is a delightful Halloween romp with a slew of clever characters. The celebrity voice cast do a modest job of bringing these ghouls to life and the writers really play with the notions of these characters that we've all become familiar with. That being said, the film never veers into the hilarity of the animated films at Dreamworks, and, though it attempts at an emotional father/daughter relationship, it doesn't end up with the emotional pull or sheer animation beauty of a Pixar film. However, it is a witty, fun, and ultimately worthwhile trip, especially during the Halloween season, where family films seem to be in the rare.B-",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Hotel Transylvania succumbs to typical modern animation downfalls that sucks the life out of the story.,"Sony's animations are usually hit and miss for me. Infuriatingly they all contain traits that really are destroying the genre. The story centres on Dracula as he creates a hotel for monsters to stay in order to seclude them from the treacherous human world. Preparing for his daughter's birthday party, a human waltzes into the hotel to which Dracula must hide him from the rest of the guests. Hosting an array of famous movie and literary monsters, we are presented with a tsunami of related puns. ""Scream cheese"" springs to mind. A few hearty moments in an attempt to create some touching scenes ultimately fall flat due to the unfunny screenplay. It tries far too hard to make us laugh, that subconsciously I'm ensuring I feel dead as a zombie whilst watching it. Soooo yes, I didn't smile once. It also gambles on dealing with racial stereotypes, yet fails to make the theme stick with the audience. That's not the biggest crime though. Pop music. God. Damn. Pop. Music. Why? In what world do we witness monsters rapping and dancing to multiple LMFAO songs? There is no point to it. I honestly don't even think children want to watch that either!? It's a trend in the early 2010s that really irked me. The animation was fine, nothing outstanding but fluid enough that they can easily replicate it in order to start a franchise (hint hint...). The voice cast was mediocre, Sandler seemed to be having fun though. The story was a montage of ""funny"" scenes tied together at the end to create a young romance. Remember kids, don't be a control freak...because it's not fun. I just...I just feel nothing towards this. It's absolutely suited to its target audience, just the lazy and uninspired approach prevents this from being good.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Poor Exercise In Cash-In Filmmaking,"I'm hardly the target audience, but even allowing for that this isn't a good film.

Is there even a plot, other than girl trying to get guy's attention? Being generous, I laughed twice. Maybe two-and-a-half times.

Average predictable animation,"Hotel Transylvania is quite a standard and average animation film. With a very typical and predictable plot outline which has been done before. Ex: An over protective father is worried about his teenage daughter growing up, she falls for a boy- father doesn't like the boy at first than eventually bonds with him and settles that his daughter is okay being with him. The only difference that separates this typical plot is that they are monsters (Draculas).The animation is decent, some interesting characters but the comedy isn't anything special. A few laughs (more so chuckles) but nothing that really stood out. Somewhat surprised how this film has spawned two more sequels.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

One Of The Most Amusing Comedies Of Its Year,"Brimming with surplus energy, hilarious from start to finish & a rib-tickling homage to horror classics of the past, Hotel Transylvania is an unabashedly funny, immensely enjoyable & thoroughly entertaining feature from Sony Pictures Animation which effortlessly succeeds with its primary goal of satisfying its target audience & is a good enough choice for anyone looking for a light-hearted fun ride.The story of Hotel Transylvania concerns Count Dracula; the owner of the titular hotel which he built to raise his beloved daughter in a safe environment but the place now also serves as a vacation spot for monsters looking for a break from human civilisation. When a human inadvertently checks into the ""no-human"" hotel, Dracula has to keep him hidden from the guests & also protect his daughter from falling in love with the mortal.While the narrative here isn't even close to Pixar-level stuff, Hotel Transylvania makes up for what it lacks in the storytelling department with plethora of fascinating characters who are very much alive n kicking, plus the slapstick humour is brilliantly handled throughout its runtime & offers plenty of laughs for kids n adults alike. And the animation is worthy of appreciation as well for it looks incredibly rich, detailed & gorgeously rendered.On an overall scale, Hotel Transylvania is one of the most amusing comedies of its year that features a very simple plot that never takes itself seriously for the most part, is filled with characters that are colourful & fun to be around, nicely parodies many horror films of past n present, and is an amusing family feature that may leave few slightly disappointed in the storytelling department but purely from the entertainment perspective, it's wild, joyful & hilarious as hell. Delightfully recommended.",,Anonymous,Animation
