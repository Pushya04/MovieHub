Audiences will be very divided.,"Let me start off by saying that I was introduced to the films of Terrence Malick in 1998 when I watched and was blown away by 'The Thin Red Line.' It is one of the best war movies ever made and while I can rant about it at length, that review belongs on a different page. It was with great anticipation that I waited for 'The New World.' I was lucky enough to get tickets to an advance screening and the theatre was full of people like me. Their take on the film was almost as interesting as the film was.'The New World' is a film that will draw out one of two very powerful emotions: Love or Hate. I really don't believe there is a middle ground in this case. I think it is quite possibly the most beautifully photographed film I have ever seen. It is astonishing. The score from James Horner is, in my opinion, his greatest work. He's a wonderful composer but he has exceeded himself on every level. This is a movie that can be watched like art (because it is) and listened to as a symphony (it might as well be one). Very few movies leave me stunned and 'The New World' is so luscious that I think it is worth the journey, even if it is only to look at how beautiful it is and listen to how glorious it is. Is that a superficial way of looking at things? Perhaps, but they are the film's two most brilliant qualities.'The New World' does have problems and I think it falls very much into a 'buyer beware' category. Malick's movie is long -- very long -- and feels every moment of it. I don't mind these things because I found it enchanting; many in the audience with me did not. These are not people who are 'dumb,' or who 'don't get it.' They are people who are used to 99% of the films that you will see. 'The New World' is very self-indulgent at times. No one can reasonably defend the pace of the film. I want to and I can't. This is a movie so full of substance that it is detrimental. It is so rich and textured that it would be hard to say where things could have been improved, but aside from the first forty minutes which deal largely with the question of whether or not the Europeans can survive the first winter or not, the dramatic 'action,' that is, the engine of a script that pushes one scene into the next, is idling at best. 'The New World' has a plodding pace and it took me on a nice quiet stroll that I enjoyed immensely. I can not, in good conscience though recommend to the man on the street that he go to see it. If less than a third of the theatre I was in walked out, I'd be stunned. I lost count because so many people left. Mostly the middle hour and a half of the film is to blame. Scenes drift from one to the next -- they're stunning and textured and personally I enjoyed them -- but they involved a lot of hanging out. Two people hanging out in the woods. I understand that the film has deep meditative and philosophical meanderings about man's relationship with nature and how one impacts the other. I get it. But a lot of the love story is about two people hanging out in the woods. All the time. If one of them had said 'Let us go watch the grass grow for the afternoon,' it would have been the most honest line in the entire film. It is the only thing I will fault Malick for here because it really does kill the film for a lot of people. His intelligence should not be questioned. I wish only he'd tried to focus the script a bit more and been specific rather than general. Can two people from different cultures be together? We get it already. We got it an hour ago. Oh, more grass growing ... must watch ... ha! Forgive my little joke.The argument to be made though is that this film has not been made for everyone (the studio is no doubt surprised to learn this and will be scrambling to recover their money -- they did a good thing in making it but they're going to lose their shirts). It was made by Terrence Malick for Terrence Malick. I'm glad to have seen it but I spoke with twenty people who were not. There will be constant arguments on the user boards here at the IMDb. The film is going to have rabidly fanatical supporters who think everyone else is just too stupid to get it. And it is going to be criticized by many, many others who died a thousand deaths just trying to sift through the movie.Two final thoughts: the first is that I hate myself for having to say anything negative about Malick or his film. He's a special film-maker and his films make it worth going to the theatre. 'The New World' is great but flawed and it is dishonest for anyone to pretend otherwise -- such behaviour is deceitful and pretentious.Thought number two is that although the film is equal parts challenging and rewarding (as great movies should be) it is especially important in the case of 'The New World' to see it in the theatre. It is so majestic in scope that I don't believe the greatest home theatre can do it justice. It is truly epic in its cinematography and score. If it doesn't win Oscars for both we will have witnessed a massive artistic injustice. NOTHING this year, NOTHING has come close to being a threat to 'The New World' for either of those two categories. Appreciate them as they were intended to be seen.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Very lone & very 'artsy'...,"This film was recommended to me and so, on good faith alone, I sat down to watch. I've heard many good things about Terrence Malick over the years and so was looking forward to a bit of a cinematic treat. Sometime things don't turn out the way you expect and this was one of those occasions. I will explain more after this brief summary.It is the early 1600's and the eastern seaboard of America is being discovered and colonised. A group of English explorers find a place on the coast of Virginia and set up a base there. They send a group lead by Captain Smith out to trade with the natives. They capture him and are about to execute him when he is saved by the Chief's daughter, Pocahontas. Thus begins the famous love story. Eventually, after helping the colonists more than once, she is forced to go and live with them. Captain Smith is called back to England by the King and Pocahontas is left alone. Believing he is dead she takes a husband, John Rolfe, but this is not the end of the story. There, I said it was going to be brief.On the positive side this film is beautifully shot with some beautiful scenery and great set pieces. Performance-wise, nobody put a foot wrong, Colin Farrell did a fine job as Captain Smith, although I felt he was totally miscast (more on that later). Q'orianka Kilcher was also great as Pocahontas, as was Christopher Plummer as Captain Newport and Christian Bale as John Rolfe. It just didn't have any energy about it. I felt so depressed by the time I got to the end of the two hours and thirty minutes.On the casting, although I have nothing against Colin Farrell, he's a fine actor who has appeared in some great films. I just felt he was totally wrong for this role, to have an Irish man (with an Irish accent) playing the part of an English man I find totally stupid and slightly offensive. But enough of that, back to the film, I it found quite boring and also very depressing. It's very 'artsy' with the characters inner thoughts being voiced, but it just didn't work for me. I will give it a half decent score for the visuals and the music wasn't too bad either, but unless you've got a spare two hours and thirty minutes of you life you don't want backÂ… Not recommended.My Score: 5.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
What You Would Expect From Malick,"The story of the English exploration of Virginia, and of the changing world and loves of Pocahontas.There are, of course, historical issues with this film. Most scholars agree that there was no romantic relationship between Pocahontas and Smith. She would have been 10 years old in 1608 when they were said to have first met. So the whole premise is flawed. But in other areas, such as the attempt to have a native language spoken, some credit ought to be given.Ultimately, I found the film to be good but somewhat trying. Malick is a strange director. Obviously talented, but he lets his artistic vision go unchecked. And then it starts feeling pretentious. Other directors could be accused of similar issues (David Lynch?), and I suppose it really comes down to artistic preference. My preference does not jibe with Malick, it seems.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Too much Malick's whispering instead of meaningful plot,"EXTENDED CUTI was digging the first part but then the plot kinda slowed down and nothing really happened besides beautiful cinematography. The pacing wasn't that good like in his other movies, maybe I'll like the shorter version more. Criterion edition of this movie looks incredible, one of the best looking films of 2000s. Lubezki really be carrying three directors huh",6.0,Anonymous,History
Staggering.,"This film was everything I had hoped for and infinite volumes more. Writer/Director Terrence Malik simply refuses to see film-making as anything short of an art form and handles his brushes (not to mention every frame) with the tender care and command of an artistic master.The warnings are true... if you're looking for standard Hollywood fare, then run away. However, if you were trying hard to remember what film-making is supposed to be about, then this film is an absolute MUST SEE. While it is not forcefully spiritual in its aural narrative, I found this film to be a deeply religious experience in ways that words fail to express.True to form, Malik affords the world of this film as much character as the humans themselves possess. Long stretches of nothing but ambient, nat sounds. Stunning snapshots of the peripheral influences to each scene (i.e. blowing grass, running streams, towering trees). Even an ending title sequence that lives beyond the narrative... breathing the last breaths of a tale that has managed to regularly transcends words.Sharp. Detailed. Purposeful. Bold. Brilliant.I have not been this happy about a film in a very long time. Well worth the money. Well worth the time. You will leave better for having seen it.I could not recommend it more!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Matoaka's Second Miranda,"Malick's method is to frame films as remembrances. Remembrances of romantic notions, whether freedom, peace, war or love (as his four films trace). This way, he can exploit a languorous floating through remembered reality that never is that gentle or considered in actual reality. He can use his narration as things remembered, floating over the sights. To make this as effective as possible, he plays all sorts of tricks with the sound, having different boundaries of different types between what you see and hear.Added to this is a considered approach to framing. You may have noticed that most filmmakers stage the action as if the world arranged itself to fit nicely in the window the camera sees. It makes for nice pictures and clear, precise drama, but we know it for what it is, a theatrical device. Malick is like Tarkovsky; he likes to discover things and if the way the world frames things so that they are off the window we see, so be it.That's why his battle scenes are unique. With most directors, you'll have smiting and dying nicely so that we can see it. Or alternatively, we'll have point of view shots that are hectic as if we were a participant. These two battle scenes have the camera as a disembodied eye that shifts about as if it were the eye of dreams, or nearly lucid recalling or even retrospective invention. Sometimes hectic as if it were point of view, but never looking at what a combatant would, instead having a poetic avoidance.I first met Malick when he was a lecturer at MIT and I a philosophy student. He spoke of French Objectivism, and was clearly bothered by how the notation and language constrained the ideas. At the time, I was doing my thesis on Thomas Harriot, who is the hidden motivator behind everything in this story Â— the real story. Malick never saw the thesis because by the time it was finished, he was off to explore this business of experiencing from the ""outside"" in cinematic language.But Harriot is likely the inventor of the ""external viewer of self"" notions that Malick liked (as they reappeared in the French '60s) and uses in his philosophy of film. Harriot suggested he got it from the Chesapeake Indians. So the circle closes: a film about a people using their own mystical memory-visions.If you take a little time to tune yourself to Malick's channel, you will find his work to be transcendent. I consider this one of the best films of 2005, despite its apparent commercial gloss and the mistaken notion that most will have that it is a love story. It is about remembering and inventing love in retrospect. A world is always new so long as the imagination of recall is supple.+++++++++The rest of this comment is of an historical nature. The love story is made up of course, but that's apt for a movie that is about invented memory. The Indians are mostly wrong, the body paint, hair and dress; according to the only document we have, the John White paintings, men and women were mostly nude even in winter and prided themselves on tolerance to the cold. There is no mention of the famous local hallucinogen, cypress puccoon which was widely traded and how a stone age people were able to survive in a land a hundred miles from the nearest stone.(My original comment was deleted, presumably because there was a note about the unpeaceful nature of the people. Readers may want to consult good histories for that.)Harriot (a scientist and mage) wintered over with a nearby ""holy"" tribe in 1585, and after he left, Powhatan destroyed the tribe lest they combine their magic with Harriot's and overcome his stranglehold on taxes. He married the wives of the chiefs he murdered. Matoaka (Pocahontas) was almost surely the offspring of this union and it is why he sent her as a naked 10 year old to negotiate with the Jamestown settlers, who Powhatan thought was Harriot returning.Powhatan never exiled Matoaka. When negotiations with the settlers failed, he married her off to a satrap in the north to expand his empire. From there she was kidnapped. When he knew that Rolfe had shamelessly promoted his marriage to an Indian princess and arranged an audience with the King, Powhatan sent the two holy men to accompany and protect her, those you see here. She presented to James, her father's cloak that is also shown in the movie. It was designed by Harriot for the his host, the husband of Matoaka's mother.The scenery is very accurate and was filmed where things actually happened and in a few spots within a few hundred yards of where Harriot wintered over (and I now reside).The Harriot/Matoaka story is a key source for Shakespeare's ""The Tempest,"" and it is likely that Shakespeare actually met Matoaka when she visited Harriot. One of the accompanying Indian priests had an argument over God with a Nixon-like cleric who subsequently published a list of all the demons thus mentioned. You can see that list of demons appearing throughout ""King Lear.""Viewers interested in racial matters may be interested to know that by the time of these events, Spain and Portugal had already imported over a half a million African slaves to South and Central America.Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this.",,Anonymous,History
This Is A Love/Hate Movie,"This is a difficult movie to review. I love the story. I hate how it was filmed. This is one of the slowest movies I have ever seen. I can handle most slow moving films but this one is above all others. It isn't that the film isn't beautifully filmed because it is. It's biggest problem is there really isn't much dialogue and it seemed as if the long, drawn out moments depicting falling in love and being one with nature was more important than anything else.These scenes were shot nicely. Beautiful rays of light, a hand gliding over blades of grass and even moments of being cleansed with smoke all had an almost mesmerizing and dreamy look to them. It was artistic but drawn out to the point of boredom.Another issue for me was the narration. The majority of the narration was meant to serve as the character's internal dialogue. I would've liked to have seen more dialogue between characters rather than just the internal dialogue of one.Lastly this movie was three hours long. It was a long three hours because there wasn't enough going on to keep you tuned in. It just wasn't engaging.I've seen where some folks are of the opinion that if you don't enjoy it then you are not a true connoisseur of cinema but rather you are simply someone watching a movie. To that all I have to say is ""Really?"". What a pretentious thing to say!Here's the bottom line. This film is three hours long. It has very little dialogue. It has beautifully shot but extremely long and numerous scenes meant to express a closeness with nature and falling in love. The story is nice but you have to go through all those long scenes to get it. I give it 6.5 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Poignant and transcendental,"First, let me applaud this film. I have been waiting for Terrence Malick's fourth film ever since I saw The Thin Red Line. Arguably, Malick is one of the most adept and deliberate filmmakers right now. The New World is nearly flawless, and the beauty of Malick's direction adds to the argument that film can still be considered aesthetic. Much has been lost in the last 30 years, but Terrence Malick sticks to what he knows. What some people may complain about this movie are the long silences, the action-less movement, and the poetic voice over. This is what Malick does. He is a modern transcendentalist. What he does with film is comparable to what Emerson did in writing. The color is naturalistic, and the sounds are earthly. It helps that Malick uses natural light for his shots, giving the scenery more life and texture. As for the substance of the film, what isn't pantomimed in subtle gestures and movements is brought to life with flowing poetic voice over. This goes all the way back to Badlands for Malick. But here, we get varying minds contributing. There are some moments in this film when the viewer has to understand the characters by their facial expressions instead of their words. I think that will be hard for a lot of people who are expecting a more vocative and kinetic film. As for the acting, I was very impressed with all involved, particularly Q'Orianka Kilcher. This young woman played the part of innocence beautifully. I also have to give some credit to Colin Farrell, considering I never expect much out of him. Unlike some of his other movies, he was not in it to steal the spotlight. Everyone played their parts without any excessive over-acting. This movie is a historical drama, but I feel like the history aspect is merely a backdrop for the Terrence Malick play. In his production, the flowing waters and the forest canopy are the actors, and the gentle reflections of troubled minds are the words. Truly, this is an incredible film. I have waited a long time for Terrence Malick to wow me again, and he has done exactly that. If you want a movie that tears at your heart strings, then go see something recycled like Brokeback Mountain. If you want a transcendental experience, one that challenges you to go deeper than the surface of the film, then The New World is waiting.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful but deeply flawed,"I had been warned that this film was a snoozefest, but I just thought that's because people nowadays are so used to loud action movies from directors like Michael Bay that they have a problem with any slow paced narrative. But this movie is not slow, because that would require some movement. It is just standing still most of the time, which is a shame because it could have been so good!Don't get me wrong, there are some great aspects to the film, visually it's a stunner! The cinematography is really really good, there are so many beautiful shots and scenes. But when it comes to plot and narrative something is deeply wrong. I think you could have cut out at least an hour without disturbing the plot at all. It is too long! And just because you have nice nature shots with a voice-over that says something like ""mother, you are everywhere"" once every minute doesn't make it deep. It just make the film boring. Also I would have preferred less focus on the relationship between Pocahontas and Smith (which consists of them staring at each other with ""deep"" voice overs), and instead have more focus on the relationship between the settlers and natives.However, I think that the part with Christian Bale is a lot better and far more interesting. Sadly most viewers won't see it because they are probably sleeping by then. I think they could have shown more of Pocahontas in London, the clash of cultures is an interesting subject.Lastly, I saw the extended cut, avoid it like plague. It doesn't add anything interesting, it just make the film even longer.",6.0,Anonymous,History
This film is a sedative.,"This film is a perfect example of a self-indulgent director-writer failing to edit it down to a watchable movie length just so he can get every one of his own visions on celluloid before his film career ends. This is one of the most slow-moving, melodramatic, contrived, over-the-top costume, cinematographic over-kill movies I have ever seen. Thank goodness someone had the sense to cast Christian Bale so that the film at least grabbed your attention for the short time he was on screen. Director Mr. Malik should perhaps take up nature photography instead of wasting studio money and the time that it takes for people to watch it.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Art,"A quite-literally breathtaking 120 minute montage of sights and sounds evoking the first British contact with North America. The narrative is minimal, even inconsequential, as perhaps it should be in a story that is predominantly about the human need to communicate even when language is a barrier rather than a vehicle to understanding. The performances are universally outstanding, the cinematography and editing award worthy, and the use of 'Das Rheingold' the most inspired use of Wagner ever in a movie. 'The New World' is a genuinely poetic, lyrical, visually stunning and heartbreaking movie. About as flawless as cinema gets. For those still unsure of my feelings, I loved this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Scenery stole the show,"The virginian scenery stole the show as the best actor, there were plenty of admirable qualities to the movie, but the actor mostly just existed on the screen while beautiful Virginia continued to present absolute majesty all around them.If there was a profound line spoken In the movie, it was whispered, lost in the overly loud score that meandered around without purpose. Meanwhile, one could lose themselves in the sun glistened waters, the wind swept grasses, the warm rich dirt.Seriously, forget trying to enjoy dialogue or plot, you'll barely see it anyway, just put it on while cooking dinner or something, you'll easily have no idea what's going on, but suddenly want to visit Virginia.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Filmed on site at Historic Jamestown and the Jamestown Settlement, it will be interesting to see some of the same scenery that I saw in the movie.

"History, what makes you think","The film in the Director's version is almost 3 hours. It is measured, does not hurry anywhere, but there is no feeling of tightness. Music helps to immerse yourself in this slow narrative, a kind of evolution of characters, to see the culture of an ancient civilization.The main characters are ambiguous, they are not sure that they are acting correctly, because the world has not known such unions and acquaintances before, and, therefore, no one understands what will be better.The experiences of Pocahontas are perfectly shown.

Gorgeous but empty canvas of primitive art...,"It's incredible to think what a great movie this could have been if as much attention was paid to giving us a literate script as was paid to reconstructing history with villages, Indians, battles, and sets that look like the real thing. The photography is breath-taking throughout, the acting is sincere, but the pace of the film is beyond slow as it recounts a vision of what is said to have happened when the colonists came to form America's Jamestown side by side with some savages who owned the land.The John Smith/Pocahontas theme is nicely handled although all of this kind of story was handled in much more robust fashion by Disney's crew a few years ago when they did their animated version of the tale. And it was a might more entertaining than the way it is recounted here.There is a wistful quality to the whole story and gorgeous landscapes to gape at, authentic sunsets with boats in full sail, and some very convincing looking battle scenes with Indians in full mode as painted savages. Nothing has been spared to give the look of the film authenticity and detailed realism.But as entertainment, it falls far short of the mark. A huge part of the problem is a dull script with Colin Farrell given no opportunity to develop his role as John Smith and Christian Slater reduced to a secondary supporting role as John Rolfe, as is Christopher Plummer.James Horner's music sounds appropriate enough although it is strangely silent at times when some emotional depth could have been aided by his score.Summing up: Deserves credit for being an ambitious project, but ends up being a gorgeous empty canvas of primitive art with limited appeal to students of American history.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A feast for the senses,"I finally saw ""The New World"" yesterday. It was quite an experience.This film is miles away from any other that I've ever seen before. It's a feast for the senses. Senses are the key to this movie. You either let them guide you or you've missed the whole point. I cannot blame anyone who has complained about how slow, boring or even irritating this picture was. This is not the kind of movie that can be appreciated by intelligent reading. Neither does it belong to the category of highbrow artistic films that aim to an intellectual elite of an audience and shut out the rest of us, poor lesser mortals. You don't have to ""understand"" this film, you have to ""feel"" it. Just open up your heart and let the emotions carry you away and elevate you. The plot is simple and far from original. Adam and Eve, paradise lost, human greed and personal ambition coming face to face with the beauty of nature and the joy of pure living. Clash between illusion and reality, dream and fact. The originality of this film lies in the way that these themes are depicted. Muted glances, forbidden touches, light and darkness mingle with the murmur of the river and the rustle of the wind Â– the breath of mother nature. Dialogs are scarce. Mainly voice overs run through the whole picture. I found them neither irritating nor useless. They are uttered in the form of inner thoughts, secret longings, muted prayers and they add to the dreamlike effect of this movie. Acting was actually very good. That was an extra bonus for a film like this, where actors are meant more to help the story and the images unfold, than astound us with their memorable performances. The actors' success in this movie lies in their ability to express their feelings through minor gestures, glances and body language. Q'Orianka Kilcher is a magnificent creature that embodies the essence of nature and beauty. She bends, she submits to the inevitability of assimilation but she never loses her freedom of spirit. Farrell's sad eyes speak volumes of emotion that could never be expressed in spoken words and Bale's kind-hearted demeanor is just perfect. ""The New World"" is like a poem. What I got out of it was a bitter-sweet taste in my mouth, a swirl of images and sounds in my mind and a wealth of emotion in my heart",10.0,Anonymous,History
Yet another stunning masterpiece from Terrence Malick,"The New World (2005) directed by Terrence Malick is a visually stunning film and based on an interesting tale of Pocahontas. Just wow! Malick has done it yet again in his fourth feature film.The story of Pocahontas is well-known. Captain Smith is spared his mutinous hanging sentence after captain Newport's ship arrives in 1607 to found Jamestown, an English colony in Virginia. The initially friendly natives, who have no personal property concept, turn hostile after a 'theft' is 'punished' violently on the spot. During an armed exploration, Smith is captured, but spared when the chief's favorite daughter Pocahontas pleads for the stranger who soon becomes her lover and learns to love their naive 'savage' way of harmonious life. Ultimately he returns to the grim fort, which would starve hadn't she arranged for Indian generosity.Terrence Malick is astounding with a camera, and every single shot of all of his films are works of art. It is highly recommended for its originality and cinematic and artful value. A disclaimer: Terrence Malick tends to attract very ambitious audiences of cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Quite simply, sensational.","This was incredible. I'm living at the moment in the awful urban sprawl of Dublin , Ireland and took myself right into the inner city to see this and, to my surprise, found myself being transported not only to another land but also to another time. When I came out, I was in a trance for the rest of the day, pining for a land and society that is no more and dreaming sweet dreams of angelic Pocahontas, gentle John Rolfe and ruggedly genuine John Smith. All three of course excellently played by Q'uiranka (is that right), Christian and even Colin who, though the accent may have been shaky, captured perfectly what it would have been to be in John Smith's situation. Mallick, of course, is a genius and when his films are this good they're well worth the decade or so of waiting.

Terrible Waste of Time,"My wife and I love movies. It is not unusual for us to see two per week in the theater. In this year of so many disappointing movies, we were anxiously awaiting The New World, which appeared to have much promise from its previews. Unfortunately, The New World proved not only disappointing, but downright terrible!Someone needs to tell director Terrence Malick that beautiful photography alone does not make a movie! People were actually walking out half-way through this empty, insubstantial picture, which was more of a boring slide-show than a feature film! There was so little script that viewers had no way of knowing who any of the characters were, and there were only haphazard indications of the passage of time. Tragically, this effort fails completely as a historical piece, and you will learn more about the story by reading the film's synopsis than by seeing the over-wrought film itself.Worse, to call this disjointed slide-show a ""movie"" borders on false advertising, and New Line Cinema has done a dreadful dis-service to movie-lovers by releasing this tripe. I would not be surprised if some slick lawyer decides to file a class-action lawsuit on the part of the misled audience.This slide-show of a film was tedious, vague, ill-conceived, ill-executed, horribly directed and just boring! I will never again waste money on any film that Terrence Malick directs! Never!Die-hard movie fans to the end, my wife and I stuck it out to the very last frame, and we regretted doing so. As we left the theater, all we heard from the other exiting audience members were criticism after criticism. And many were not as kind as this review!Rarely has a gathering of such talented actors, production designers and photographers been so ill-served by a flimsy script, terrible directing and inane editing. Not to mention a music score that was so inappropriate at times that it elicited laughs from the audience during tragic scenes.The only consolation is that word-of-mouth will surely get this picture out of theaters very quickly.",1.0,Anonymous,History
a deep artistic pleasure,"The New Worldreviewed by Sam Osborn rating: 3.5 out of 4Filing out of The New World, completely speechless and without notes, I could fathom only single adjectives to describe the experience. Looking at these listed words on my memo-pad now, they read ""Thunderous, True, Beautiful, Solemn, Forceful, Gripping, Honest, and Slow."" And for those who watch The New World with a calm countenance, an open mind and a ready cache of patience, Terrence Malick's long-awaited picture will have a similar effect. The film is a masterpiece thirty years in the making.His goal is plain enough: to affectively and honestly portray the love Pocahontas experienced in those first years that Europeans cut their first, fresh swath from the New World. But Malick goes far beyond a simplistic love story. I was at the screening for Casanova a few days earlier, where the film's objective was essentially the same: to portray the love between Casanova and Francesca in the days of Inquisition Venice. But where Casanova approaches love at a bubbly, comedic perspective, The New World throws itself into a headlong narration of love's sorrow. Every frame of The New World reflects this painful, aching emotion, utilizing the sounds and images of environment to incredible, innovative effect. The first shot of the film--an extended shot several minutes in length--finds the camera staring into a river. It's clear and pristine, carefree and surrounded by the blissful sounds of an unperturbed forest. Soon ripples begin forming, and we notice the quiet droplets of rain pit-pattering around us, causing the water to flow a little, bringing about a contented onslaught of lily pedals. The scene continues on, drawing us farther and farther into Malick's deafening reality with only the sounds and images of nature. He creates a calm within us with these images, a kind of serene canvas for him to later paint the vivid brush-strokes of human love later in the film. In this entire first act, little is even said. But these scenes rarely grow tiring. He finds rich beauty with every situation. His forest is lush and his settlements picturesquely Dickensian. Malick shows great and rare confidence with this picture. Few filmmakers would have the cool audacity to create a film so primarily reliant on nothing being said.The first and most important of Pocahontas' (Q'Orianka Kilcher) romances is with the infamous John Smith (Colin Farrell). He's brought to the New World bound in a cage, punished for earlier mutiny. But because he's the only soldier of the expedition, Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) opts to let him free on a strict probation. Their first encounters with the Naturals, as they're called, go coolly enough, with curious interest from the Naturals and tense hesitation from the settlers. And even here Malick plays with flights of romantic whimsy. These scenes of first encounter are shot in windswept, overgrown grassy fields, with Pocahontas dancing and twirling about them with her brother, catching the spry interest of Smith.Soon the settlers hear of a great city of Naturals down the river, and Smith is sent to investigate. Things have been going badly for the settlers and Captain Newport has left back for London and a new store of food and supplies. Smith's expedition is cut short, however, when he runs into a narrow, maze-like complex of swamps and is ambushed by warrior Naturals. He's taken prisoner by the Naturals, but granted life because of Pocahontas' curious interest and her favoritism with Chief Powhatan (August Schellenberg). This catalyzes our entrance into The New World's most prominent territory. The scenes of Smith's time with the Naturals are Malick's best. They're those first strokes of paint on his canvas and the seeds of that palpable, historical romance.But admittedly, even with The New World's supreme sense of confidence and slow-moving progression, it sometimes wanders into the realm of self-indulgence. It especially grows tiresome in the final act, when we're brought from Virginia to London, our beloved Smith left behind to be replaced by John Rolfe (Christian Bale) and his stonewall courting of Pocahontas. I'd even venture to say that Malick could have left 30 minutes of these segments on the editing room floor, re-attaching them later to the Extended Cut DVD release that's sure to come. But movie-going patience is the mantra of the Awards season, and so some bottom-dragging in films is what's to be expected.What was not to be expected, however, was Q'Orianka Kilcher, the debuting actress playing Pocahontas. Few words she says, but dialogue is not always what makes a forceful performance. Her body language and expressions are allowed to do the speaking for her. She's advantaged also by her strong, muscular features that often betray hints of divine femininity. Farrell also does well, particularly in his somber narration. He reads it as though he speaks the words to himself, whispering them almost, for only his imagination to hear. But his physicality is manipulated nicely as well, exuding bubbly chemistry for Kilcher. The two mix ideally. Their sorrow and love and deeply resonated emotions are echoed about with their strong performances and Malick's supreme direction. And although Christian Bale strides into picture in the latter parts of the film, our hearts lie with Smith and Pocahontas, and we find ourselves resentful of Rolfe's advances. But this is just Malick's narrative trickery. We find ourselves raggedly torn between these two equally honorable men, and put almost into the same position as Pocahontas. It's precisely the reason we go to the movies. We've let the director take his grip on us and lead us down the path into characters and identities of his own creation. And with Malick leading our way, and with characters as tastefully dimensional as these, movie-going becomes a deep artistic pleasure.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Has its moments, but...","I loved ""The Thin Red Line"" as well as Terrence Malick's earlier movies, and ""The New World,"" which I saw tonight at a guild screening, is very similar in style to ""The Thin Red Line."" It is intensely visual, with many wordless sequences, and uses interior monologues/voice-over from several characters. Also like ""The Thin Red Line,"" it creates a tapestry of nature and the elements to define its characters. The landscape, rivers, fields and forests are very much prominent characters here. The film is at times utterly mesmerizing and captivating on a visual level. However, it saddens me to say that overall, ""The New World"" just isn't THAT emotionally involving. At 2.5 hours, it's long. And what's worse, it feels it.The cast does a fine job, and Q'orianka Kilcher is especially talented (and lovely), but the script isn't as strong or as focused as it needed to be. Still, I admired several sequences of powerfully visual storytelling, especially those depicting the lives of the native Americans, so in the end I would have to call my opinion mixed.",6.0,Anonymous,History
shocking,"The only reason I can understand people would give this such a high rating is because they think that a slow pace and lack of dialogue means art and deep. It is not. As a film studies teacher i've watched films with slow narrative, in fact many of my favourite films are slowly paced but this is snail like and its all over the place. It jumps from some kind of documentary shot (hand held running through yet more grass) and ambient sound to another beautiful shot of our main female character wearing a Vivien Westwood cut dress (was it fashion for native Americans to wear off the shoulder animal skins or 3/4 crop tops in 1608) Its awful. Go watch crash, Capote, walk the line, sideways even batman begins for modern Hollywood, this is dreadful. Its like watching a 10hr Calvin Klein or Tommy advert, i kept expecting them to whisper ""eternity by Calvin Klein"". There are some great shots but then not as good as many other films that have a fully explored plot depth and content. If you want deep and sexual frustration watch lost in translation. I can't think of another film that tries to be such an epic and fails so bad maybe water world....but even that film is better. For all those that keep saying how this is an art film, maybe try peter Greenaway, if you want to be visually stunned especially prospero's books, or the cook the thief his wife and her lover. This isn't art; its Hollywood trying to do subtle, and it doesn't work. An art film is not just something that looks pretty it is supposed to challenge the audience, the only challenge here is to sit all the way through.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Discovering More of the Globe.,"John Smith (Colin Farrell) lands in the titled location of present-day North America in the late-17th century. Strains come from the natives immediately (led by chieftain August Schellenberg and warrior Wes Studi) as their balance of nature and peaceful surroundings is threatened. Pocahontas (a smashingly amazing starring debut by youngster Q'Orianka Kilcher) ends up being the liaison between her people and the British newcomers. A deep ethereal love blossoms between Farrell and Kilcher, but time and circumstance will not allow it to be. The focus shifts as more newcomers come and a young John Rolfe (dynamite role for Christian Bale) falls for the hypnotic Kilcher and marriage follows. Kilcher does not only win over the British in her land, but in theirs as well as historical fascinations bring her over as both a curiosity and also an early diplomat for connections between old time lands and new ones. Carrying a heavy burden not only historically but also cinematically, Kilcher's role becomes the thing legends are made of. ""The New World"" is simply out of this world all the way. The eclectic and highly enigmatic Terrence Malick (writer/director) appeared lost forever to the cinematic world after his triumphant ""Days of Heaven"" in 1978. He popped up again 20 years later with ""The Thin Red Line"" (the very best film of the 1990s). The rumor mill made it appear that he may not be heard from again. Thankfully he was some seven years later in 2005. Malick's production is everything you would expect from arguably the finest American filmmaker alive (the most interesting and fascinating anyway). Poetic undertones and the deep philosophical questioning of life and our place in this world mix with top-notch cinematography, a hauntingly beautiful score and wonderful set pieces. Farrell, made out to be the top-billed star, disappears about half-way through and the focus shifts to Bale and Kilcher. The three are on cinematic highs rarely reached and the supporting performers (most notably Christopher Plummer, Jonathan Pryce and Alexandra W.B. Malick in basically cameo roles) are well-placed players in Malick's operatic ode to this sometimes unbelievably beautiful and complex part of early North American/world history. Way too smart for most audiences and much too methodical and strategic for shallow cinematic viewers, ""The New World"" proudly sits next to Malick's other three masterpieces as one of the very best pictures ever conceived. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,History
An Epic Romance,"In the beginning of the Seventeenth Century, along the English colonization of North America, Captain John Smith (Collin Farrell) leaves the Jamestown fort to explore another area and trade with the Indians, but he is captured. The princess Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher) asks her father to spare Captain Smith's life and they fall in love for each other. When he returns to the colony, he becomes the president of Jamestown and finds people starving, but Pocahontas brings supplies, saves them and falls in disgrace with her people. When the Indians realize that the English will not leave their country, they attack and after a bloody battle, the English trade Pocahontas and lodge her in the fort to protect their families, and Captain Smith loses his position because he does not agree with the arrangement. With the return of Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer), Captain Smith is promoted and sent back to England, and he asks a friend to tell Pocahontas that he drowned along the trip. Pocahontas is civilized and baptized by the English and John Rolfe (Christian Bale) proposes and marries her. Many years later, she hears that Captain Smith is alive, and she has to decide if she keeps her marriage or follows her heart.""The New World"" is an epic romance with a wonderful cinematography and soundtrack, but the low paced story is too cold in its narrative. Terrence Malick, as usual, builds the complex characters with many existential problems, leaving the passion and flame of love aside. I liked this beautiful adult version of ""Pocahontas"", but I did not feel any emotion in the end of the story.

A beautiful look at the birth of a nation,"Undoubtedly not for everyone, Terrence Malick's slow moving yet quietly powerful and astoundingly beautiful epic The New World is a stunningly realised cinematic experience, that must surely go down as one of the most naturally beautifully and heartfelt pieces of filmmaking ever delivered, as the divisive Texan filmmaker takes us on a ponderous and contemplative trip back to the early America's to tell the true story of Pocahontas and her life filled with love and heartbreak.Here reviewing the Extended Cut of Malick's film, drawn out to near 3 hours from its 2 and a half hour theatrical cut, The New World is never afraid to bask in its own thoughtful and imagery driven nature and for those that found the original cut too much to handle this is a version of the film you'd do best to steer very far away from but for anyone that has ever found themselves transfixed by Malick's unique filmmaking sensibilities, this stoically paced version of Malick's tale will be a joy to be a part of.It's hard to put into words just how beautifully put together and hypnotic The New World is should you let it wash over you and take you away in a manner that only Malick at its best can do, as the filmmaker's collaboration with legendary production designer Jack Fisk and renowned cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki achieves resounding results in this end product.It's not hard to see the similarities to Lubezki's work here to Oscar heavyweight The Revenant on which he was inspired by The New World from and his collaboration with Malick really is a match made in heaven, as if nothing else, this dream-like experience takes us on a visually splendid adventure to a time and place long since forgone.Key to the effectiveness and moving nature of Malick's grand vision here however is how his clear affiliation and respect for the story of Pocahontas allows him to deliver one of his most straight-forward and accessible films of his career.Never officially named in the film as Pocahontas, the Native American princess is luminously brought to life by then first time actress Q'orianka Kilcher, who lights up the film with her verve and energy that combines well with the more solid but grounded work of lead actors Christian Bale and Colin Farrell.Her turn ranks right up the best turns in a Malick film, up there with Sissy Spacek's unforgettable performance in Badlands and Jessica Chastain's glowing turn in The Tree of Life and while the film may not reach the near perfectly pitched highs of Malick's adored Days of Heavens, Badlands, The Thin Red Line and The Tree of Life, The New World is arguably not far away from being just as quintessential as those works, works that assured Malick would go down as one of the all-time great filmmakers, regardless of the naysayers and unaffected by the more forgettable entries that Malick has delivered over the last decade.Watching Pocahontas's story unfold before our very eyes as her love for Farrell's John Smith and then Christian Bales John Rolfe takes us on a spellbinding nature filled journey, examining man's place in this world and quest to better our more bloodthirsty and primitively destructive spirits is a cinematic delight, that whilst not perfect, is more affecting and illuminating that so many other cookie cutter offerings that Malick has managed to avoid over an impressively constructed career, driven by projects that inspire and move him and allow us as an audience to be left memorized by the results.Final Say -Allowing more time to enjoy the beauty on screen, this extended version of The New World is a must-watch for fans of Malick's work, as the once in a lifetime talent showcases a love story for the ages, that just so happens to act as one of the most eye-capturing films ever shot.4 Â½ kettles out of 5",9.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful Marriage of Aural and Visual Meditations on Discovery,"""The New World"" has an opening five minutes where Natives rush to the shore to get a view of the massive British ships that are about to land on what would become Jamestown that are every bit as fantastic as any of the scenes in Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". It's a perfect marriage of sound effects, music and visuals that literally paints itself onto the celluloid as a jaw dropping work of art. The nature of ""discovery"" and the power of film is boldly on display in Terrence Malick's brave ""New World.""Some viewers will undoubtedly get lost in the visual and aural poetry, while others will be annoyed at the lack of a focused narrative and the sometimes sketchy character motives. This is a historical drama, and the amazing sets, costumes, and make-up attest to the wonderful attention to period detail, but there's also a dreamy surreal nature to the pacing that will lull some to sleep who were expecting a more traditional docudrama. This is more about the myth of Pocahantas and channeling ghosts than it is about the actual history behind the story. The dialog is as evasive and minimal as the visuals are overwhelming and painstaking. Plotting is secondary to the mood and meditations on love, discovery, curiosity, innocence, and the clashing of cultures.Malick does a great job at showing the civilized and barbaric sides of both the Natives and the British. It's a wonderful testament to that first realization that there is intelligent life outside of one's own world. Central to this discovery of the ""New World"" is the romance between John Smith (a modest Colin Farrel) and Pocahantas (an amazing Q'Orianka Kilcher) which is displayed with just as much wide eyed-wonder and innocence as Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Christian Bale as John Rolfe and Christopher Plummer as Captain Newport are also very good when they are allowed to act amongst the lush scenery. Composer James Horner, who is probably second only to John Williams in creating unforgettable movie music, outdoes himself as his rousing symphony (coupled with divine music from Wagner) perfectly matches the reverence and awe with which Malick uses his visuals to paint the myth on screen.Some judicious editing may have benefited the middle portion of the film, which amounts to scene after beautiful scene of two people falling in love while worshiping nature, but there are two more series of scenes (one in the middle and one at the end) that are every bit as uplifting as the opening one and serve as a perfect synergy of visual and aural delights that completely transported this patient viewer to another realm. I'm not so sure that this is what it was really like to live in 1607, but I have no doubt this is what the people of that time dreamed about.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Malick Stumbles,"It gives me no pleasure to report that the fourth film in nearly eight times as many years from that most roguish of Hollywood's rogue directors, Terrence Malick, is mostly a failure. Give the guy a break, though. When the first three movies you make are unequivocal masterpieces, you're allowed to stumble.All of the devices Malick has employed in previous films to turn what would be sweeping epics in the hands of any other director into feverish internal character studies are present here. But in ""The New World,"" they curiously have the reverse effect. Instead of drawing us into the minds of his characters, Malick keeps us at a distance, and his film remains too enigmatic for us to fully appreciate.The biggest problem with this movie is its non-committal tone. According to history (though granted, there are many different accounts of the Pocahontas story), John Smith was pretty much an ass, who left Pocahontas behind because he didn't really want her---in another account, he's forced to leave America because of a severe injury. Malick turns the Smith/Pocahontas story into a star-crossed lover's tale, with Smith the smoldering hero who turns away because he wants to protect Pocahontas from a world that won't accept her. Except that once she is taken in by the colonists, she's treated just fine, which makes one wonder what the big problem was to begin with. Malick uses his usual ruminating voice overs to draw us into the minds of Smith and Pocahontas, but this time around their thoughts don't communicate anything of much importance.Malick's version of the tale feels tidied up and sanitized, lacking in any dramatic conflict. When Smith meets Pocahontas again in England after a long absence, something about their exchange brings closure for her, and she is able to forget Smith and commit herself to her husband and child---but what that something is remains a mystery, for neither the screenplay nor the performances convey it. And Pocahontas's death feels rushed through; surely Malick could have trimmed one or two meandering scenes of tree and sky earlier in the film to give it a better sense of symmetry.The performances really disappoint too, but I'm not so sure that's the fault of the actors as much as it is the writing. They're not really given robust characters to play, so no one registers all that much, not even Q'orianka Kilcher, who's supposed to be a lifeforce to which everyone is drawn.""The New World"" probably warrants a second look, and I suspect I may come away admiring it more after I see it again. Malick's films aren't easy, and that's what I like about them. It's just that he's been on such firmer ground before that this movie fell way below my expectations. Immediately after leaving the theatre after seeing ""The Thin Red Line,"" I knew that I had just witnessed a masterpiece in real time. Leaving the theatre after ""The New World,"" I knew that I was just leaving.Grade: C",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Pretentious , dull, directorially self-indulgent rubbish","Make no mistake about it, this movie is appalling.Yes, it has some haunting music, some beautiful scenery and one cannot fault the authenticity of recreating the period of history. The problem comes when you start looking around for a dialogue, a story, any excitement or any involvement in the proceedings.There is an awful lot of people wistfully staring at each other, a lot of trees blowing in the wind, rivers, birds, spiders and, well, wildlife. It seems as if the director is waiting for a story to come to him, and in the mean-time, look at that flock of birds.Another thing that strikes you, is the lack of a script. I think in the 2 1/2 excruciatingly boring hours of film, there must have been about 100 words said. Ethereal musings like ""Who is he?"" and ""Where did he come from?"" and pretensions like ""What is life, Mother?"" come drifting down from the screen. Meanwhile, from around the theatre I could hear moviegoers asking each other ""What the hells going on?"", ""What are those birds doing?"" and ""shall we go?"".I am sorry to the other reviewers who have rated this film so highly, as I can see what they are saying to some extent. The problem I have is that to make the points that this film is ramming down our throats - about the destruction of innocence and good-nature vs. evil-""civilisation"" - it does not need such a deadly passive storyline to do it.I cannot help feeling that the director was doing everything he possibly could to stop the film being labelled as an ""action"" movie. He dampens every potentially good action scene so that it doesn't get too exciting. Even the few battles there are, are short-lived 'hand-bag' affairs where no one seems to get hurt - It's like watching ""Pocahontas and the A-Team"".Unfortunately, in striking the balance between poignancy, style and story, he got it completely wrong. Movies like ""Last of the Mohicans"" have beautiful scenery, a love story, excellent action sequences, script and makes all the points this movie tries to in much less time.I fell asleep in this movie. Granted I was quite tired, but this movie pushed me over the edge. I fell asleep at the bit where the girl meets King James until she is walking in the garden having been reunited with Cap'n Smith.

Review for The New World,"I am watching this film for my history through film class. I have to write a review on it.The film is about Pocahontas and how she came to a new world. She meets a man named John Smith in the beginning and they later part. She moves to Jamestown where she learns English. She meets another man named john rolfe and marries him. I noticed they dressed different due to the different time period. The natives focused a lot on connection with nature. The age difference with the male and females did not matter due to it being in the older times. There was also cannibalism at some point throughout the movie due to no food. There was nothing really that made me question the accuracy of the film. I dont know much about Pocahontas. The ages were off thats all i really know. Some connections I can make from other movies Ive seen of Pocahontas is the disney version. She meets john smith. Three things I liked were the actors. I also liked the scenery they did for the natives. Another thing I liked was the costumes they used. One thing I didnt like were the camera angles. Overall I thought the movie was interesting.

"""The New World"" enamors with beauty","*Watched the 172-minute extended edition*It feels unfair to assign a numerical rating to a Terrence Malick film. He is the prime example of film being a purely subjective art form.I can't explain why ""The Tree of Life"" is one of the best films ever made and ""Song to Song"" is pretentious trash, despite both of them being nearly the exact same in style and story.The title, ""The New World"", has multiple meanings as the film tells the story of John Smith and Pocahontas's reaction to the unknown lands and customs they experience.But like all Malick films, the plot description you read is only just a snippet of the entire product. It's more contemplative than literal, inviting you into a poetic world filled with more beauty than the eye can comprehend.Malick supplies you with all the pieces you have come to expect. Absolutely gorgeous cinematography, whisper narration, a wonderful score, and great ""acting"" (what is acting in a Malick film?). It is up to you to find meaning and worth in what he is giving you.For me, I found the first half to be some of the best work Malick has ever done. His exploration of the ""savage life"", one filled with holistic community, makes you want to leave your reality behind and leap into the screen. Kevin Costner may have done this in ""Dances with Wolves"", but Malick outshines him with his rolling camera as it takes a much more observational tone.What has become a trademark of Malick is that the second half rapidly loses momentum as it mainly rehashes the same points. The film is saved by the final ten minutes, but the 100-160-minute span feels rough.""The New World"" makes you cry tears of beauty and tears of boredom.

"Something Old, Something New","A breathtaking landscape populated by looks of discovery. Very few words, just the sensation that something is changing. Terrence Malick is one of my heroes but I had the feeling that, this time, he was expecting too much from me. Within the lushness of the surroundings there is something static, unapproachable, inaccessible. Q'Orianks Kilcher as Pocahontas is, quite simply, sublime but her emotions, and therefore mine, were kept so far removed that it was hard for me to get involved.

Visually beautiful--if you can stay awake,"This film tells the familiar story of Pocahontas, Powhatan, John Smith, and John Rolfe in a manner appears to be intended to be more historically accurate than most of the fantasized versions of the story that have been depicted over the years. For the most part, it succeeds, with some glaring exceptions. Malick's most daring venture was to cast a 14 year old actress in the role of Pocahantas, which puts her not far from the age--traditionally 12--that the real Pocahontas was at the time she intervened to save Smith's life. The young actress is half Indian and half Caucasian; I guess they couldn't find a full-blooded Indian for the part. The first disconcerting note, at least for this viewer, occurs fairly early in the film when Pocahontas raises her arms and we see that her armpits are shaved. An Indian girl, in 1607? Not likely! This inattention to detail threw me out of the film's frame of reference, reminding me that I was watching a film and that this is an actress who, even at this tender age, can't allow her image to be besmirched by being filmed with hairy underarms.The film is visually beautiful, as Malick's films usually are. The camera glides over some of the pastoral scenes, and we get a sense--as we are clearly meant to--of how pristine and unspoiled the North America was before the white man came. The actors in the three principal parts all perform competently and are successful at conveying their thoughts and feelings nonverbally. They don't have much choice, because there is very little dialogue. And, thankfully, the Indians are not portrayed as saintly or noble, but quite accurately as people going about their business who are alternately fascinated by and fearful of these intruders. They rightfully foresee that the settlers might not want much now, but they might want much more later.So, the film has much to recommend it. But it has a fatal flaw: it is excruciatingly slooooooooooooooooooow and boooooooooooooooooooring. It could easily have been pared by a third and edited to an hour and a half length. Instead it plods on for two and a quarter hours, long long after I had come to appreciate the visual poetry and had gotten its obvious points (in case you don't know what they are, this film will be a delight for tree huggers and cultural relativists).In the final analysis, I suppose the film is worth seeing, but have a few strong cups of coffee before you do.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Colin Farrell & Christian Bale's love sick expressions were warm and sensitive but after the 400th time it was annoying.There are good things about this film: Christopher Plummer always adds authenticity to films......Q'orianka Kitcher was perfectly cast as Pocahontas. She looked very Native American and was really lovely! Good to see Wes Studi again, star of ""Geronimo: An American Legend"". Background and scenery was entertaining as was the story of early America.Worth seeing if you can just get by the slow parts. Probably worth a 5 or 6 out of 10.",,Anonymous,History
Beauty of Spirit and Nature,"This film, if taken on the level(s) of what it sets out to portray, is gorgeous and simply without equal. It has its flaws, but it's a film that ought to be judged by the vision which drives it. On the aesthetic level, one can hardly find flaw with it. Malick is brilliant in that he incorporates elements which mainstream Hollywood has trained itself and its unthinking audiences to avoid and/or have no taste for : long, drawn-out scenes of nature, many times of simple stillness or limited ""action""; actors using their bodies and faces rather than the spoken word ; soundtrack-musicless scenes which transport the viewer into that place and time... There are countless other examples to be sure. This was the first film by Terrence Malick that I've seen, and I loved this style. There will be some who will not enjoy it, so be warned. I, however, was prepared for it, having read about the film and Malick's style beforehand. I had moderate expectations of this film, going in, and they were completely surpassed.Malick is also walking an interesting line between myth and reality in this film. It's a unique combination which I've not seen before. Although the film has elements which are more realistic than in other portrayals of the Pocahontas story, the film's story, in the end, recounts the known 'legend' version. So people will potentially find 'holes' in that aspect of the film. I am not altogether familiar with the most historically accurate chain of events, but I found the reverential treatment of Pocahontas by the white settlers a bit extreme. Especially since she was the only female for quite some time in the colony, and was surrounded by a bunch of desperate, half-starved men.However, it's important to note the themes which really drive this film, which I am assuming, are Malick's vision : the almost spiritual beauty of the untouched wilderness of Virginia ; the similar purity of the Native tribes, so fittingly referred a few times as ""naturals,"" and the vile intrusion on all this by the white colonization. I believe the portrayal of the English colonists and the elements they brought with them is as close to reality as I've ever seen in a film. They were shown as not necessarily intending evil (well, at least not all the time!), just doing things as they thought fit, without regard to anything else. Malick still doesn't excuse the evil outcome of all this, and is simply contrasting the two societies. And what a stark contrast! I'm not Native American, but to me, the film portrayed the tribes with a post-modern perspective of admiration, almost envy, and the fascination of an outsider. And clearly from a point of sympathy. In the end, one can never escape the fact that people lived on this land, and strangers from afar came with expectations of usurping it. Simple as that. If one reverses the roles, ie, whites in their native land contending with strangers from afar, one can get an idea of that sympathy. At least, that's how I always imagine it, and I never understand people who feel defensive and try to justify colonialism. There is justification for respect for another in their land, and mutual trade and co-existence. There is no justification for hostility, stealing land and genocide.All of the actors in this film were outstanding. I think all the Native American actors deserve recognition for their amazing transformations. The way they moved, looked, stood, crouched, etc. It was phenomenal to watch. In all the scenes involving the tribe, I was just riveted, in awe. In all honesty, I felt the amazement, curiosity, fascination, and trepidation which those early colonists probably felt. This is probably a result of the whole style, but the Native actors deserve praise for this.The three main actors, Q'orianka Kilcher, Colin Farrell and Christian Bale, were excellent. Kilcher was completely believable in her portrayal of the instinctual teenaged Pocahontas. She was natural in the role, though she is so young. Between Farrell and Bale, I had much higher expectations of the latter, and he didn't disappoint. He was just amazing. Bale's John Rolfe has much less screen time, and less dialogue but he was able to capture and convey the conflict and past of the character effectively. I have to admit that I am a prior fan of Bale, but Colin Farrell is the one whom I'd vote 'most improved.' His portrayal of John Smith is surprisingly nuanced, complex and rather subdued, the latter in keeping with the whole theme of the film. I think it's quite a feat for Colin Farrell, who really should be proud of his performance. I was going to make a comment about his Irish accent, which he makes no effort to disguise, but since Malick didn't have a problem with it, who am I? :) But truly, I think this has to be one of Christian Bale's best performances, though I haven't seen all his films (just three others). Part of the reason why I enjoyed his performance, and the others, is that I had read that Malick was asking the actors to ad-lib a lot. So I watched for this, and actually noted such a naturalness in many scenes, that I thought they HAD to be ad-libbed! My own favorite is when Pocahontas falls down, and she and John Rolfe dissolve into laughter. That seemed completely genuine / unscripted. It was a very sweet moment to leave in an otherwise awe-inspiring film.If there is one complaint that I have, it's that I find the love story/triangle rather trite, but then again it has its roots in history, and that's not really a criticism of the cast or director or the others who performed their jobs beautifully on this film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Story of Pocohontas,"I finally got around to seeing this movie and for me it was interesting in many ways but disappointing in many ways as well. Still, this movie gives both an interesting, quiet glimpse of a New World ... and uses this to deliver a deeply appealing Story of Pocahontas ... and this is the Story that really drives the movie, IMHO.I like the cinematography ... especially the very moving, very convincing initial glimpses of the New World; and almost all of the visual scenes in England.Acting is generally OK. With one important exception: Q'Orianka Kilcher as Pocohontas/Rebecca. This young lady is simply superb in my opinion. She has a wonderfully winsome quality about her, a lovely smile, and as it transpired ... to my surprise ... that this movie becomes above all *her* story ... she carries off this really very complex role with an appealingly convincing authority from start to finish. What a wonderful characterization. Many thanks, Ms. Kilcher! The depiction of the Native Americans ... innovatively styled the ""Naturals"" in the movie ... is to me very appealing and interesting but also (alas) too steeped in the Noble Savage tradition for my own taste. The early Bad Europeans vs Good Natives depiction is simply unconvincing.The music at the beginning and toward the end seems to me to support the developments and mood very well indeed. However, narrative and inner voicings sometimes sound simply too loud. Some of the things said I couldn't make out; I don't know if that's just me or not ... but that happened so much that I wondered if either sound was defective, or direction perhaps erred in permitting slovenly enunciation.The script, unfortunately, seems to me very poor and very unconvincing ... there are simply an enormous number of ""holes"" that kept challenging my attempt to surrender to the movie's imaginative depiction of history. The sort of Romeo & Juliet depiction of Pocohontas & John Smith is fine by me, but adding in a full scale love triangle to me needlessly complicates what is already a very full plot.The polyvocalization and the ""stream of consciousness"" scene sequences in the middle do not really work very well for me at all. The slow, steady pace seems to me to drag at times. And I don't know when last I've seen a ""mainstream"" movie that seemed so laconic. Plain vocal communication was amazingly sparse; too sparse.The overall contrast between the New World in America and the New World in England to me does make for a wonderful taste of one view of the history of the period. The clash of cultures and the historical setting make a truly wonderful context for this wonderful story of Kilcher/Pocohontas. Themes of individual and history, and choice and destiny, of truth and dream, are all woven into both the historical/cultural contest and the personal Story of Pocohontas in a very appealing way despite the drawbacks mentioned above.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Beautiful But Slow Story,"""The New World,"" directed by Terence Malick, tells the classic story of Pocahontas and Captain John Smith. Here, Colin Farrell plays Captain Smith, while Pocahontas is portrayed by newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher. The story follows these characters, as well as the Indians and English settlers at Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607. It's not clear exactly how historically accurate the story is. Kilcher makes good in her debut, playing the timeless Indian princess as kindly and compassionate. As for the movie, the imagery is lush with shots of beautiful forests. Some of the dialogue is well-written, such as the poetic voice-overs. But the story is slow in its pace. Either the movie had to be shorter, or there had to be more elements to hold the attention of the viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A whole New World of film-making!,"Terrence Malick's film, The New World,is a cinematic experience like no other. Set in Virginia during the Discovery Age, The New World sends the viewer back in time for a retelling of the story of Native American princess, Pocahontas, and gives a detailed perspective on life for the English Settlers of Jamestown and the Native Americans that encounter them. Colin Farrell, Christian bale, and new-to-the-screen actress Q'Orianka Kilcher lead an outstanding cast as John Smith (Farrell) John Rowlfe (Bale) and Pocahontas (Kilcher). The films cinematography is outstanding, having a subtle, artsy style that truly captures the essence of the story and time period. The costumes are extremely well done and fit the period. Unlike past Pocahontas tales such as Disney's version, Pocahontas, the story is historically accurate and the Native Americans don't speak English, and certainly not through magic as in Disney's story. Overall, The New World is a dramatic, yet fast-paced and compelling tale that is put on the silver screen perfectly.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The New World is a flop!,"Hi Everyone,I must first tell you that I am in no way a movie critic. I just felt an obligation to inform everyone about the truth about this movie. I went to see this movie last night with my fiancÃ©. The movie started out with promise. You were introduced to beautiful scenes of what is supposed to be 17th century Virginia. The only flaw I found here was that the music was irritating. It was a very loud group of strings which were pulsating for minutes on the same two tones.I was very excited when the cast appeared and the story began. The first 20 minutes had plenty of conversations between the characters. But after that the movie went down hill. When we are introduced to Pocahontas the story was believable. The only problem is that she never really talks. You hear a narrator in her voice (as if you were hearing her thoughts) but her entire lines to the other cast, John Smith included, could have been placed on one page of the script. The story has no real fight scenes or action of any sort. My fiancÃ© wanted to leave one hour in but I made her stay in hopes that this movie was just waiting for some climax.First I must say I do not mind chick flicks. If there is humor, love, action or sports I am all for it, but this move lacked all of the above. All Pocahuntas kept asking herself is, ""Who am I......Who am I."" She falls in love, but never talks to him...he leaves...she falls in love again, never talks to him (maybe has a kid, I couldn't really tell), maybe wants to leave him.....and so on.I am not lying when I tell you that the FEMALES IN THE THEATRE WERE SLEEPIN! All their dates were waking them up. When the movie was over you could hear one man say, ""think God"" from the back of the theater and a lady in front of me say, ""That was the worst movie of history!"" Just please save your money and go see Harry Potter again or something. Maybe rent this movie but I wouldn't even do that.You can go and see this if you want but all I can figure by the rating is that people went and say this movie and were so bored that they decided to come home and vote that the movie was good. Now they are laughing at me because I wasted my money on it. It was the only way that they could find humor in wasting 2.5 hours of there life.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"In This Case, It Pays To Know In Advance","Be prepared.That's the best advice I could tell anyone who is thinking of watching this film. If you know what you are going to see, in this case, you'll be better off because if you are expecting an action-packed historical adventure story, you will be bitterly disappointed.This is s-l-o-w moving, very slow, and fairly long at two hours and 15 minutes. If you realize that and don't care you might really enjoy this movie. If you enjoyed ""The Girl With The Pearl Earring,"" you'll like this. Those two films are similar in beauty and pace.If you love good visuals, which I do, then this is a DVD you want to view. Terrence Malick has directed only four movies in 33 years and all four are beautifully filmed, the best being the second: ""Days Of Heaven."" I would rank this second to that film in terms of beauty.Cinematography-wise, there is a lot to like in The New World, especially the scenes on the water, which are magnificent. I wish there more of them. What we see is Jamestown, Va., in the year 1607, so this film is about as rural as you're ever going to see America.It's the story of Pocahontas (although she's never called that in the movie) and her relationship to two men: John Smith (Colin Farrell) and John Rolfe (Christian Bale). Newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher plays the Indian girl who is given the Christian name ""Rebecca"" later in the film and this woman is mesmerizing throughout. What an innocently-interesting face!Of the three leads, the shocker is Farrell, who is very low-key, rarely says much and is almost strange in his behavior. If you've seen him as the obnoxious and profane public-relations sleaze in ""Phone Booth,"" then picture the opposite, and that's him in this. Unfortunately, I had just watched ""Phone Booth"" last week so seeing Farrell in this role was bad timing for me. He just didn't fit! However, Kilcher and Bale are fantastic and people you really root for to wind up happy.Without giving it away, the ending haunted me for a few days afterward. In the end, it is a powerful story, not just scene after scene of gorgeous photography (which it also is). There is more to this movie than the camera-work, but there is no doubt the cinematography is sitll the main attraction.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Film as Poetry,"The New World is the closest thing to film as poetry that I have seen in a long time. While some may find the length and lack of traditional dialogue off putting I feel that is what has turned this stunningly photographed motion picture into a visual poem. Malick has fashioned one visual feast after another using the wilds of Virginia and the civilization of England. We see the world through Nothing/Rebecca's eyes, all wondrous and expansive and the greatest gift she gives to Smith is the ability to appreciate the new world in which he has landed. While in the battle between the Native Americans and the English more colonist die than were actually in residence at the time, Malick can be forgiven for this one foray into Hollywood land type film-making. I do think that some judicious cutting might have made the film stronger but with visuals like this the choice of what to cut and what to leave in must have been excruciating. A beautiful gift, it will be a classic much like Lawrence of Arabia and its like.",7.0,Anonymous,History

The storyline was unique, actors-realistic and scenery/cinematography was pleasing. It is however one of those movies that you either like it or hate it. It's not recommended for those who need strong story lines or plots to be captivated by a movie. Great break-through role for Q'Orkianka Kilcher who for being only 15 does very well as Powhatan's prized daughter Pocahontas. I also enjoyed watching the way some Tribes lived in the 17th century, free from many of the disturbing traits common in the Americas. There were (I felt) a few loose ends but nothing serious.

"Fine aesthetics and artistry, slow story","This movie is a faithful retelling of the Pocahontas biography, boasting some beautiful scenery, sincere acting, well executed point of view camera shots, and sympathetic characterizations. Its only notable weakness is a story that moves slowly in places.Q'Oriana Kilcher is a genuine and appealing Pocahontas, personifying a sense of wonder with life and appreciation of nature that is immediately endearing. Colin Farell, as Captain Smith also does well, and they enact a gently understated yet passionate ""first love"" romance which is believable and sweet. The story poignantly outlines how the legendary couple were caught in the middle of racial tension and victimized by events beyond their control. Most photography is done with at eye level, from a character's point of view. This is done in most of the movie, and works particularly well in a battle scene; you see a combatant's view from the middle of the bloody skirmish. I also like the narration by characters telling their own feelings of the events transpiring, sounding much like the recollections of a person reliving the experience as they make a diary entry.However, the movie endeavors too hard to tell the whole story, sometimes burdening itself with an abundance of superfluous details. Even minor characters are developed well, sometimes more than necessary to plot development. The result is that the action tends to lag occasionally.Overall, however, a visually pleasing movie, which makes a well intentioned effort to portray Pocahontas and Smith as very real and human.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Lovely Reflection on Human Nature,"It broke my heart to see how a few patrons walked out of this film without giving themselves a chance to experience one of the most intense and transcendental experiences of a lifetime. This film reaches beyond what words can say and truly forces one to look inwards and connect back with worlds that don't exist anymore.There is a purity to the beauty and intensity of the feelings Mallick has managed to convey in his storytelling. There is no much dialogue, and at times the film appears to move very slowly; this is what appears to be problematic for a few members of the audience. It is as if action has to be symbolized by outburst of special effects and inane dialogue where a simple look or a gorgeous depiction of how we are one with nature suffices. The film uses plenty of symbols to show how we are one with this world; whether it is new or old. How mother nature must feel neglected by our decisions to embrace modern technology, or the latest novelty of whatever type it must be.It would be incorrect to call the film simple because it is a very complex and meditative look at how our world and our lives change. Through the eyes of a very intelligent and perceptive man, we are exposed to places our souls rarely encounter. There is direct power to the images in the movie: the flow of the water, the clouds in the sky, the dance of the smoke, the visceral moves of the various human beings. In ""The New World"" an embrace, a look, a slight touch carry endless and powerful meanings to the people in and off the screen. The audience is carried along and should be able to tremble with the passion and tenderness the movie's protagonists experience. Without reservations, all the film's principals do an outstanding jobs in their respective roles: Christopher Plummer, as the wise captain who truly understands what it means to see a new civilization. His choice of words says much about what he has encountered in Virginia, as he calls the local people, ""naturals"". John Smith is played quietly and with much insight by Colin Farrell, an actor who can do marvelous work in quality films. His tortured adventurer is man who doesn't belong in his century, as he able to see beyond what lies before him, but he is also unable to comprehend the power of what surrounds him. In a second masterful turn this year, Christian Bale proves himself a very competent actor, as the introspective soul who doesn't want to change destiny but goes along with fate, whether this could mean more sadness or his desired happiness. He is superb this time out.Yet, the film belongs to a newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher, giving a performance as lovely, complex, and as magnificent as anything some of our greatest actresses have done. Her expressive eyes are the link between the soul of man and the essence of nature. Her physical gestures reflect on how her world is adapting to the new forces that are now intruding upon it. Her love scenes are some of the most beautiful and romantic ever put on screen, intense because of their purity. There is no wasted dialogue, no overblown musical score pushing the inability of a less capable director, nothing else is needed but a close up of a young woman who tells us how amazing humanity can be.Throughout the film, there are several moments where the audience can't help but gasping at how far we have departed from what we truly are. Nothing rings false in here, as we see how far our feelings can carry us. There is such a range from the generosity of several of the characters in the film, to the fear and despair some of the first arrivals had to go through.Much is to be praised about its technical aspects as well, in particular about the gorgeous score by James Horner and the unbelievably beautiful cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezky. Jack Fisk's and Jacqueline West's art direction and costume design were truly inspired, and the great screenplay by Mr. Malick should be studied by those who want to explore, discover, and understand how a true master of cinema works to produce a lovely canvas.I could go and on, praising this superb film; however it is not fair for me to tell you what it is. It is for you to go and discover its pleasures as your senses are enveloped by the experience.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"THE NEW WORLD {General Release Version} (Terrence Malick, 2005) ***","Few directors can film nature the way Terrence Malick can which, coupled with James Horner's mysterious yet evocative score, make this epic feel closer to Werner Herzog's AGUIRRE, THE WRATH OF GOD (1973) than THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS (1992) - to make it has been compared. Besides, the weird ritual scenes when Colin Farrell is first captured by the natives, seem to have strayed in from APOCALYPSE NOW (1979)!! However, impressive visuals - including the appropriately savage battle scenes - aren't enough to offset the general pretentiousness - which also affected Malick's previous effort, THE THIN RED LINE (1998) - that results from the relentless voice-over (which becomes alienating after a while, and is usually muffled to boot!) and especially its disorientating fragmentary style (which does no favors to individual characterization or the sweeping narrative, and is filled with inexplicable jump-cuts!).Q'Orianka Kilcher comes off best from the large cast, since she appears throughout the entire film - whereas Farrell more or less vanishes during the last third to make way for Christian Bale. Christopher Plummer is commanding in his brief but pivotal role, but David Thewlis is wasted as a sneering villain - while John Savage's role as a demented priest and that of Jonathan Pryce as King James I barely register!THE NEW WORLD originally premiered in a 150-minute cut (the General Release Version loses some 15 minutes), which only played for one week in selected theatres in the U.S. Ironically, this happened when I was in Hollywood at the end of last year and, had I known it would have been re-edited, I'd have made my utmost to catch this alternate edit of the film before it disappeared, perhaps forever!",7.0,Anonymous,History
So many people miss the point of this movie,"I have finally seen the movie my soul has hungered for all my life. A film that is at once beautiful and resonant, with a spiritual depth, conveying the essence of our connection with God, the interaction between the Divine and Man. The film that is wholly satisfying on every level, with no mis-steps.I can now say ""The New World"" is the best movie I've ever seen. Exceeding Tarkovsky, Kurosawaâ€¦.better than any one of them.This is not a ""Love Story"". Not in the traditional sense. It is about the Love of God as it flows through us.It is a film about Innocence. The power of innocence, the necessity of it as the thread that binds you to the experience of God. I mean the Innocence that is wisdom, without guile, full of compassion, imbued with joy that is in the moment, neither in the past or future.What the film shows so well is that this eternal resonance within us all is not bound to another person, not bound to a place, a time, or the transient things that you see around you. The journey conveyed in the film is the cutting of our artificial ties, breaking the conditionings that say I am defined by this person, by this place, by these times; by my reaction to the external. What is so exquisitely communicated in this film is the growth of this realization within Pochahontas. Joy is eternal, our connection with God is always there, it never goes away. It is our innermost choice is whether to let the external play affect our direct connection with God, which manifests as the bliss of Joy, utter peace, compassion, dignity, and the magnetism of a beautiful soul.Pochahontas had this connection; she was loved and respected by all. As the film progresses she begins to falter, letting her innermost essence be clouded by ""events"", by the things that happen on the outside. By the end she has regained what once she expressed so effortlessly, growing deeper, being in Joy and connected. She made that choice, the choice we all must make, the choice we make each moment.Smith has farther to go in this movie. But in the end he realizes the Truth that he had glimpsed, knew that was the direction he was headed, knew that he always had more to let go of, more of the Past clinging to him bringing him out of the present moment, away from the Love of God.""The New World"" is primarily about these eternal spiritual truths. All of the themes in the movie revolve and spiral around them. There are so many wonderful layers to sink into when watching it, it really cheapens them to get into details.It is really too bad that so many people miss the depth of this film, looking so closely at the details (love story, plot, historical accuracy, etc.), especially as this movie is so clearly about things below the surface. (This point is so beautifully communicated in about 5 seconds towards the beginning, as we ""look up"" from the depths of the water at these ""naturals"".)I would recommend this to anyone who longs to see what film can aspire to as an art form. Go into the film with those expectations and you'll be wholly satisfied.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Nutshell Review: The New World,"Yet another victim of incorrect marketing, for those unfamiliar with Terrence Malick's style, the trailers would have mislead you to think that The New World is one heck of a suspense filled action packed movie. It is not. What is evident is Mallick's style imprinted throughout, with characters expressing innermost thoughts through voice-over narratives, plenty of nothingness, and beautiful postcard visuals.For the new generation bred on Disney's Pocahontas, The New World is a more adult take on the tale. There is no song and dance, there is no ""magicalness"" in this new world, and there are no characters perpetually on Prozac. Think along this line: the Louis Cha martial arts classic series The Condor Heroes, and Wong Kar Wai's Ashes of Time. The former being Disney's Pocahontas in ease of understanding, the latter being Mallick's movie. Same characters, similar stories, in a grittier adult environment.The New World begins with the merry men of England's colonials seeking new grounds to set up camp, and slowly develop their new found lands. Wait, make that a bunch of hungry desperadoes on the verge of insanity when their food supplies are threatened. And they come with prejudices as well - the native Americans are categorized as savages, but as we witness ourselves, it isn't difficult to understand who the actual savages are. Discovery and exploration cut both ways. The English, through John Smith, discovers the way of the natives (ala The Last Samurai, but without much dialogue here, but plenty visuals), and the natives, being introduced to the English way of life, through the Pocahontas character. But as with clash of the cultures, the native Americans know of what the colonists have in their plans. First to establish a beach head, then to expand inwards with the possibility of threatening their own existence. What to you do in times like these? You counter-plan for a pre-emptive strike. Beginning with kindness, and if it doesn't work, then it calls for more drastic violent measures.While the big picture's that of politicking, the more focused aspect will be going behind the thoughts of the main characters - John Smith (Colin Farrell), Pocahontas (newbie Q'Orianka Kilcher) and John Rolfe (Christian Bale). While they do not dialogue much throughout the movie, they rely on sheer acting skills to bring their characters to life. Which somehow is a joy to watch. The innocence of Pocahontas shone through brilliantly, as did a very complex and layered John Smith. John Rolfe perhaps was the more straightforward, generous character that is the easiest to understand.Weaved into the complex narrative style is that of longing. Smith longing for the life out of the new found land, Pocahontas to eventually much spend legitimate time with Smith, and Rolfe, perhaps the shortest screen time amongst all three, added into the fray in a triangle relationship (Seriously, I'm don't qualify as a Bale groupie, but it was a really long wait before he appeared and had something to do. So fans, please take note). Besides love and longing, I was actually laughing inside at the sheer corruption of the colonists - strongest man of the moment rules, and another else can challenge the authority of those in power just with the strength of a powerful gun. Quite civilized.You have been warned. Not everyone will appreciate Mallick's works. It'll take a while to get used to during the course of the movie. You'll find many scenes with a familiar feel (didn't I see something similar a while back), especially the wheat fields, so sexy.",7.0,Anonymous,History
the strange & wonderful art of Terrance Malick,"Great, sweeping, lyrical shots of the natural world. A passionate but respectful infatuation between the camera's eye and the lovely face of a young beauty we've never seen before. Ever-climbing, harmonious waves of symphonic delicacy. And a powerful, labyrinthine mood built of images that court the eye rather than assail it. These are just a few of the pleasures offered by ""The New World."" Something to realize, right from the start, about Terrance Malick's new film is that he's telling his story on an abstracted plane and by way of the mythological mode. If just hearing that gives you a headache, then maybe this isn't the movie for you. Otherwise, you're in for a real treat.Okay, okay... So maybe Pocahontas was a mere ten years old when she saw her first white people and only twelve when John Smith left her and the Jamestown settlement in 1609. Maybe there was no enigmatic, and potentially romantic, relationship between the two. But this is all beside the point. Malick is not interested--and we can be ever so thankful for this--in telling a polemically-oriented story. He's not interested in giving us a dry, by-the-numbers, cinematic regurgitation of fact, or in constructing some historical-revisionist fantasy.It should be obvious, for anyone paying attention to Malick's unusual filming style here, that this Pocahontas (played by the 14-year-old Q'Orianka Kilcher) is the archetype that has grown out of her legend. Here she is woman-as-land, a rather obvious but effective metaphor. Malick builds onto the metaphor two love stories, each taking as its object this blend of woman and land. The first romance (with explorer John Smith--Colin Farrell) is one of innocence, at least on the part of Pocahontas. The second (with farmer John Rolfe--Christian Bale), by far the more difficult relationship, is a romance of experience. These romances, of course, are what make great myth and great cinema. And like all great legends, this one presents a larger-than-life story yet leaves us to draw our own conclusions from it. But that's art for you--something with which most movies shouldn't be confused.And how refreshing it is to see a film built from elliptical, intuitive patterns of imagery and soliloquy rather than from a dogged plot or ideologically-motivated pandering. The New World--like Martin Scorsese's ""Kundun"" or Peter Weir's ""Picnic at Hanging Rock""--is that rare thing, a dream you can sink into, a place to momentarily lose yourself in visual and aural poetry.",10.0,Anonymous,History
a film that haunts you.,"Terrence Malick returns after what seems like forever since 'the Thin red line' with 'The New World'. Based on the story of john smith (that's Pocahontas Disney fans). It tells the story about when the explorers of old travelled to America for the first time and clashed with the natives. Progress turns people ugly and soon the uncharted and unaffected locals become trampled in mans pursuit of greed. Following on from the concepts that Malick started to explore in red line this isn't so much a film but more a visual poem. What I at first thought was a pointless voice-over soon soothes the soul as it floats over the stunning visuals of the wilds of the untouched land. As the star-crossed lovers fight to keep the love between them a secret but alive the story ebbs and flows along at a pace that works like wind blowing through long grass. Everything here from the soundtrack to the poetic words layered over the colours of the world and its inhabitants creates a kind of dreamlike feel. With elements of the work of Andy Goldsworthy in the streams and logs, plants and rocks this film is just amazing to look at. Malick has a way of directing that seems to contain pauses and fill the film with space. Clocking in at two and a half hours you don't feel it at all as you sit in the cinema and let it wash over you. Another great film from a subtle but very talented director.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Meh..,"Very vivid scenes and great costumes. Other than that.. the story was very long and drawn out. A lot of the time people didn't talk, they just thought. Either that or just some long drawn out scenes with a long music score. The music was nice but went on too long when people could be acting. Sometimes I didn't know whether people were thinking or talking to each other. Good thing I was streaming it, because I had to rewind a lot to figure out what was being said. You have this 5 minute scene of people just standing, looking, or doing something else with no talking/thinking and then all of a sudden things are said and I have to rewind. I used closed caption which was perfect for this one, because otherwise I'd probably be lost. It could've been a great movie. I can understand why I've never heard of this one before. Several well known actors in it too. A lot less silence and people staring at each other and I would've really enjoyed it.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Better editing needed, but beautiful film","There's a lot of gratuitous visual footage in this film, and better editing would have made it more bearable through the first and middle parts. Quite frankly it got boring. There's time when such cinematic styles work and times when they do not, and i felt they did not with this film. The acting is OK, there's no great performances here. This is a bit puzzling as the cast is pretty good, i would have expected more but i feel the acting was hampered a bit by the tone the film set. After it picks up its entertaining... but if you are looking for historical representation you may just want to read the real accounts. Once i got over the standard Hollywood stereotypes it got better. Take it for a fun, fictional ride and not a historical drama and you should be fine.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Quite wonderful... as a Silent Movie,"It's surprising to read that so many viewers were bored with A New World. Being both highly interesting and educational, the movie held our interest throughout. At our age, we often fall asleep during movies, but neither I nor my wife lost interest in this well acted story, in spite of its 2Â¼ hour length.The problem for us was the inaudible dialogue, comprised of much whispering and low muttering by the actors as well as an unnecessary and unwanted narrator. The soundtrack (other than a deafening, indefinable roar during the opening and closing of the movie) was beautiful, although it too managed to drown out much of the dialogue. By the end, I was reminded of the silent movie era, when the only sound was that of a theater organ.This movie's shining accomplishment is the rich cinematography, in my opinion highly deserving of the Oscar it was nominated for but strangely, did not win.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A slow and contemplative meditation,"For my second Terrence Malick film (and there aren't too many), I have chosen THE NEW WORLD. It's basically the story of Pocahontas, starting from the settlement of Jamestown when she met John Smith to her later life when she married John Rolfe and moved to England. Of course, being that this is Terrence Malick, the minutiae of historical details aren't really adhered to and the story is told in rather broad strokes, making sure to hit all of the important historical moments but generally being a slower and more contemplative meditation on the themes that its director is interested in. While I was perfectly fine with the abstract story in THE TREE OF LIFE, I felt that it didn't quite work as well here. Still, Malick has crafted a stunningly beautiful film that explores themes of discovery, conflict, the search for happiness, and making the most out of difficult situations. What I thought worked very well was a restrained use of voice-over that served as internal monologues. Absent a lot of dialogue, this provided an essential window into the various characters. I also loved the numerous shots of natural beauty which were expertly captured by Malick's frequent cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezski. As far as acting is concerned, everyone gave a really good performance, although the cast was subordinate to the imagery. The score was also excellent, and in particular I liked the simple piano theme that played when John Smith and Pocahontas were on screen together. However, despite all of this really positive stuff I do think that the film dragged a bit in places and I found my mind wandering somewhat. I suppose it would have helped if this wasn't a story based in historical fact. That way I wouldn't have had expectations about how it should have been presented. Honestly, I would have a preferred a more straightforward telling, but what I got wasn't bad by any stretch of the imagination. Overall, this is a technically superb film that has some interesting observations on life, but it did subvert my expectations a little bit.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A poetic expression, an original perspective, but..","I don't really enjoy watching stupid love stories, but this movie has something else to say. Those who are expecting a fast action movie should not get their hopes up because the movie progresses quite slowly but with a poetic narrative. It may bore some people as it is quite long and has almost no dialogue. Those who want to look at the historical stories of the natives and the whites from a different perspective may like this production. The part that impressed me the most was the visual depiction of nature from an artistic perspective. In general, the movie is not great because it has a very slow pace, but watching the harmony between humans and nature accompanied by visuals can be said to be impressive. The movie does not live up to expectations, but it leaves an impact.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Like Watching War Paint Dry,"Let me first say that I am a big fan of historical epics. As a matter of fact I joyfully sat through all 6+ hours of Bertolucci's ""1900"" in one sitting at a revival house; in short, I am not some dolt who wandered in because ""Underworld 2"" was sold out.That said and trying to avoid hyperbole, this is among the most pretentious, self-flaggelating, ponderous pieces of bullshit ever forced upon an unsuspecting public. I was so bored I actually felt nauseated.Mr. Malick does not know the first thing about dramatic writing-that is why 60% of the words heard in the film are voiceovers by John Smith, Pocohontas and The Tobacco Farmer That Looks Like a Movie Star-who even though they are respectively a military man, a Native American princess and a One Dimensional Plot Device all narrate with essentially the same voice. This gets old rather quickly. If all three of these characters have the ability to narrate, then from whose perspective is the story unfolding? The answer to that question is the obsessive camera that luxuriates on floral shots that look like they are outtakes from Walt Disney's True Life Adventure Series, while the real action is relegated offstage.It is surely a case of The Emperor Has No Clothes here, people are afraid to call the movie painfully dull due to the pretensions of artsy-fartsy that are present; worried they will be accused of ""not getting it."" This is the reason that the reviews amongst professional critics are evenly split 50/50 between raves and pans, very few are middle ground. This alone should warn the moviegoer that one should tread forward with great caution if planning to see this snoozefest.One last thought: He cut seventeen minutes from this? If it had gone on for seventeen minutes longer I would have woven Ju-Ju Bees into a rope and hung myself.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A unique story telling expirience,"Hello and welcome to my review on The New World. I watched this movie for a U.S History through film class and here are my thoughts on it.The filmmaker (Terrance Malick) tells the story of exploratory captain John Smith, and how he comes to meet the other main character Pocahontas, a native american girl living in America. John Smith runs into her when he gets lost on a trading exhibition to reestablish his position as captain. The natives want to kill him, but right before he's about to be killed, Pocahontas throws herself on him to save his life. He then spends time living among the natives (or naturals as they are called. This is something very important to know that will help you understand the film better). He learns their ways and culture and in return, he teaches her his ways and language. I won't spoil the rest, you have to watch and find out.For the most part, this film is pretty well executed. The framing is clean, the colors are distinct, and the camera quality is great (for 2005).There are some things that I raised an eyebrow to concerning this films historical accuracy. Number one, by the end of the film, Pocahontas is completely are nearly fluent in English. This is odd considering the fact that near the end of the film, John Rolfe uses some very sophisticated English when talking to Pocahontas. She somehow understands all of it, and the emotion behind the language.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The score needs improvement,"In The New World, Malick has created a film which poetically communicates this historic story. In my opinion, the cinematography, script and acting are great. I was impressed with the visual components which harmonically work in lieu of duologue during pivotal scenes. The edit at times seemed a bit choppy, but once I adjusted to it, that also added to the rustic naturalistic quality of the film content and period.The only improvement could have been with the music which I found not only did not support the movie, but was distracting. With the right score, I would have been able to connect all my senses. It is the first film I have seen that the music bothered me as much as this did.",7.0,Anonymous,History
I was bored to death,"This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time and I was bored stiff. I came REALLY close to walking out. While I admit that the photography was, at times, quite beautiful, that was the only redeeming feature of this movie. The story was not told, it was shown. That is fine if it's done right, but more often than not, the movie jumped from scene to scene with HUGE gaps of time and story left out in between. I was constantly wondering what had just happened. Then there was the fact that nearly every other scene was of Pocohotas and/or John Smith in a field of tall grass, either walking slowly, running backwards laughing, caressing the other person, or running their hands across the grass. I lost track of how many ""tall grass"" scenes there were.There was very little dialog, which made the story even harder to follow. The narration by John Smith and Pocohontas was always mystical and dreamy and poetic. It added absolutely nothing to the story and was actually pretty annoying. Instead of words, this movie consisted mostly of exchanged looks between characters. But you can't tell a story with just glances/glares/smiles/frowns/etc. between characters. In fact, we should BE so lucky to have seen any sort of emotion exhibited by these characters, except the one scene of Pocohotas sobbing and rolling around in the mud.Maybe I'm one of those people who just don't ""get"" this movie. It seems to be getting mostly good reviews, but when I read why people like this movie, I find myself disagreeing. I much prefer movies like Cold Mountain or Last of the Mohicans, which are also beautifully filmed but have a wonderful story to tell in WORDS along with the beautiful photography.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Good movie, but could have been much better.","I saw this movie at an advanced showing at the U.N. building as part of their monthly program of choosing a U.N. member film to show to students.The movie, overall, was much more historically accurate than the Disney production of the Pocahontas animated film, was less flowing. The flashbacks and scene changes are choppy. The silent pauses, though meaningful, get very tiresome when they have been used between Pocahontas, Captain Smith, and John Rolfe for about, literally, the twentieth or thirtieth time. I'm not sure if it's a reflection that the Native Americans weren't disposed to verbal conversation, or verbal conversation was not common between Native Americans and whites, but it weighed down the movie and slowed its pace, making for a bored audience.Unless there are closed captions, those who are not used to British accents may find it hard to catch lines when they are spoken quickly and/or sound distorted. Subtitles are lacking, although it may have been intentional to show how clueless the white settlers were in dealing with the Native American language.Q'Orianka Kilcher, who along with another actor who played the part of one of the Native American warriors, was available for a Q&A session after the movie, did a superb acting job for her age and relative experience. The casting was pretty well done, as far as I could tell, but the script didn't do the movie justice.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A Painful Reminder of the Trouble With Imperialism,"This picture is quite simply a gem in the aspect of cinematography. The way in which Malick crafts his shots throughout the film, making wonderful use of light and color, brings this epic story to life before our eyes. The powerful performances from Colin Farrel, Christian Bale, and the angelic Q'orianka Kilcher bring out strong emotional responses from the viewer. It is indeed a well written and well crafted piece of work.The most impressive angle on this film that I can see is the way in which the rich and beautiful culture of the Native Americans are depicted. Imagine a society without greed or fear. No struggles for power or acts of useless violence. A place where people have no concept of personal property because there is real equality, freedom and opportunity for all. An existence in which people share, love, and live in mutual respect for each other and nature. A truly classless civilization.We in the West, have no perception of what a society like this is. We are so busy with our addictions to wealth, power, and personal gain. It has been proved time and time again throughout history, that when a society such as the Native American's exists, it is not long before an imperialistic power will seize it and plunder it in the name of reform, betterment, or religion.This film is a painful reminder of the trouble with imperialism and the death and destruction that it brings. It shows us that the only truth is in love and understanding, and that despite an Establishment's attempt to replace freedom with false hope, natural freedom can never be changed or broken.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Brave and Powerful Film,"Something happened in the 80's. There was a defining moment that systematically changed how people look at the world. I didn't know it then but when my teachers told me of the first Thanksgiving and the story of Indians and Pilgrims living together in a peace in harmony little did I discover that it was all a lie. By the time I got out of Elementary school I heard the heartbreaking story of how the white man killed every last Native American with extreme malice. So what was the truth, who was at fault? It was only after years of figuring out just how history works that I came to the conclusion that (for the most part) History is rarely black and white and the monsters and heroes that have become part of the story are rarely as monstrous or heroic as they seem.That's what makes Terence Malick's THE NEW WORLD so bold. It doesn't try to tell a story about America, but he tells a story of two people trapped between themselves and the world that continues to change around them. You will find little here about how horrible Europeans are or how savage the Native Americans are, instead you get a lyrical poem about the simple curiosity that must have come over the Native Americans and European Settlers at the birth of America.THE NEW WORLD begins just as America does at the dawn of the Jamestown Colony. Its 1607 and two ship has dropped off the men who will successfully settle the land. Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell) is sent to the local Native Tribe to make friends and alliances for their very survival. He meets and falls for Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher) who asks her father the king to spare Smith's life. On Pocahontas' instance the King helps the men of the Jamestown settlement survive their first winter, but disowns his daughter after he realizes these men are not leaving.Terrence Malick has crafted a beautiful film. The score is lush, the photography beautiful, and the performances are just golden. At the heart of this film is a simple (and yet dramatically complicated) love story. I could have been set anywhere, in fact hundreds of films have dealt with the theme. But Malick gives us characters worth rooting for and embracing and a story that is told simply and beautiful.Q'Orianka Kilcher embodies Pocahantas with such a sweet demeanor and striking curiosity. She is strong, and joyful, and seems unfazed by the world around her. I loved the scenes when she goes to England. Somehow her performance, which was so raw and passionate, made me believe she had never seen Western Civilization before. She is the lynch pin to this film and somehow carries it with an amount of courage and yet a simple aloofness. She makes acting look easy.Malick also wisely doesn't pull the story down by cluttering it with dread, or political correctness. Some will probably argue that the film turns a blind eye to the suffering cause by 17th Century Colonialism. But that's not what this film is about. THE NEW WORLD is about a girl, who becomes a women at a time when the world was changing.The film is also about groups of people exploring each other for the first time. The Settlers and the Native people don't have histories baggage to hold them back. They are simple men and women trying to figure out who these strange people are that have moved into their neighborhood. It's amazing to watch, the outcome of this history can and will be discussed for years and years. But THE NEW WORLD is not that forum.I have my qualms with the end of the film. The story could have been a little stronger, but because the characters have so much heart and the film is so beautiful I didn't mind. At the end of the day plot developments are pointless, when you have Characters with heart and power. THE NEW WORLD is a film worth watching, and embracing. It's a strong character driven tale that is both bold and daring simply because it chooses heart over politics",9.0,Anonymous,History
an hypnotic and mesmerizing work of art,"When you see Terrence Malick's ""The New World,"" you feel as if you are watching an exquisite poem coming to life on the big screen. This achingly beautiful work is only the fourth film in over thirty years by Malick, one of the least prolific and most talented directors in American movies. As with his previous films, ""Badlands,"" Days of Heaven"" and ""The Thin Red Line,"" Malick eschews storyline and action for artistry and mood.""The New World"" is a haunting evocation of that moment when two alien cultures met for the first time face to face. The year is 1607 and a fleet of ships dispatched by King James of England arrives on the shores of North America to establish a new settlement called (what else?) Jamestown. There to greet them is a beautiful young Indian princess known to us as Pocahontas who winds up captivating and falling in love with John Smith, the future leader of the settlement. Along with the expected clash of cultures, Malick showcases the heartbreaking story of two people who fall in love but are ultimately kept apart by their differences.Nobody captures the sheer exquisiteness of the natural landscape better than Malick, and every shot here is a masterpiece of composition, form and lighting. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki has wrought endless miracles with his camera in terms of both movement and the framing of his subjects. Although the film is extremely studied and slow-moving, it is never static or boring, so enthralled are we by what it is showing us. Malick reminds us here that for all the advancements made in the art of special effects, it is good old-fashioned photography that can really make the jaw drop and the eye pop when it is done this well. Moreover, Malick has used natural sound beautifully, weaving it into the fabric of his love story, much as he has done with the exquisite and haunting musical score composed by James Horner (""Titanic"").Even though the characters say little to one another - much of the dialogue comes in the form of voice-over recitations of journal entries or interior monologues - the filmmaker is able to convey romantic yearning with extraordinary force, primarily through facial expressions, bodily movements and lyrical camera-work. As Smith, Collin Farrell provides just the right combination of brooding introspection and wistful tender-heartedness to make the romance work. 15-year-old newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher turns Pocahontas into an almost ethereal presence, perfectly matching the dreamlike nature of the film.It would appear that the Motion Picture Academy has chosen to snub this film in most of the major categories (with the exception of cinematography). What a shame, for even though some people might dismiss ""The New World"" as just Art with a capital ""A,"" this is actually one of the most enthralling and cinematically beautiful films of recent times. It has the rare ability to transport you to a different world and leave you aching for more.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Beautifully filmed torpor,"I kept quiet throughout the movie, as I thought my wife - who likes films with period pieces,Indians and romance - was enjoying it. She told me afterwards that all the ladies in the loo hated the movie because it was sooo slow, and she agreed with them. The movie is terribly self indulgent and languid, oh did I forget to mention it is quite beautifully filmed (I think everyone who wants desperately to find something good will say that.) More is said by John Smith and Pocahontas (whose name is never mentioned)in commentary than in actual dialogue, and I found both difficult to understand. He, because of a guttural English accent, and she because of her softness. I was happy when Bale came on the scene, if only because he spoke clearly.This movie reminded me of ""Days of Heaven"" with it's endless scenes of scenery and scant dialogue, and lo and behold, I did not even know, until just now, after googling it, that it's the same director. That's worrisome, I think, to have a style that is so recognizable, yet only known by cognoscente. It speaks of the smug joy of esoteria.

It Stinks!,"The trailer didn't impress me much, so I was expecting the movie to be mediocre, but I must say I was quite surprised; The New World is the worst movie I've seen on the big screen in a long time. And most of the other terrible movies I've seen were at least bad enough to be funny. This one is just awful. The running time is 150 minutes, not really long by today's standards, yet it feels infinitely longer. If you asked me to describe the movie in one word, I would probably have to use ""boring,"" but that really only begins to describe it. If you don't write too large, you could fit all the dialogue (including the intensely dull internal monologues) from the whole movie onto one 4x6"" note card, and the vast amount of parts when nobody speaks are also strangely devoid of music or sound effects. Last night was the first time ever that I could actually hear the film projector running. The movie is also full of so many jump-cuts that they have to have been put there deliberately, yet they have no purpose at all and are only jarring, and only further remind you that you're watching a crappy movie. The cast has a lot of really great actors, talent that is completely wasted on this movie. Jonathan Pryce, for example, is an exceptional actor, yet his role in The New World comprised sitting still, standing up, and clapping like an excited six-year-old. Sadly, this is not an isolated case in The New World. The worst part is that it is completely pointless. Throughout the entire move almost nothing happens. I really can't stress enough how lousy this movie is. Ironically, the popcorn I got was really good, but I didn't finish it.

What Types Of People Hate This Film?,"I haven't seen this film so I'm not going to rate it, being as humble as I am (meaning I could've just as well, or should have, put a 10/10 just to celebrate the sheer inexpressible genius of Malick's movie-making artistry).Anyway... I just wanted to point out that about 80% of all the negative reviews about this film complain about the length of the movie. This says just about everything about the validity or reliability of the review and the nature of the reviewers. Malick's films are operas, or better yet - symphonies, and can never be long enough. But I guess they want a fast-paced action movie, with cool dialogs and Arnold Schwartzenegger in the lead or such BS, that finishes quickly so they can get out and go on stressing through their fast-paced hectic lives. There's no time for contemplation, they probably have a deadline to reach or a bus to catch.That's just the thing that Malick defeats in his films (or tries to), his films talk to us about our connection to nature as where we physically and spiritually come from, and not to the synthetic simple-minded robots we've become in this accelerating modern-day society. His films are more harmonious philosophical and emotional meditations than mere entertainment, which I guess -since they're so used to that- is all they want, and can comprehend...Then there are others, who probably aren't so superficial, and might even be regarded as intellectuals, complain that he's pretentious and stuff, and I can see why they would think that, but how can you be anything BUT sentimental and pretentious -or rather how can you SEEM to be anything but that- when trying to express such overwhelmingly immense and profound notions/senses?Even I might dislike this film, I don't know, but I just wanted to point out that I don't trust most of the negative reviewers, because I know what types of people they are, and what they have to say about the film is completely IRRELEVANT. They explain more about themselves in their reviews than about the film. What they really put on display are their simple and shallow states of mind and incomprehension for the art.There actually are a few negative reviews about this film that are serious, and I've taken them in consideration (but of course I will still go see the film as soon as I get the chance).Thank you and good night!""What difference you think you can make, one single man in all this madness?...""",,Anonymous,History
Only love is real,"Q'Orianka Kilcher in the role of the young Indian Princess Pocahontas ""is"" the movie. From the first to the last image she captivates us with her presence, her smile, her pure and sweet look, her words and last but not least her deep inner thoughts that we hear through her off voice. All the other characters are mere counterpoints of her acting which deeply fulfills our sight and our hearts and minds. I don't care if the movie respects truly the biography of Pocahontas which is itself full of less clear aspects as far as you know nowadays. Artistic freedom allows some creative liberties in that field providing they don't adulterate the essential truth which this movie doesn't. Besides the main theme which is the princess herself and her love story with a British captain, we are allowed to watch enough of the clash between the world of the British soldiers and settlers and the Indians living and owning that part of the New World of which they finished by being dispossessed violently as we all know. One final note that is also a key to understand this movie better: Captain Smith in the end admits that after all the true reality was made up by the love hours he had spent with Pocahontas in the forest in the beginning of the movie and nothing else. Love scenes shown here in very chaste images (we hardly see a lips to lips kiss) sparing us the sight of breasts and other anatomic delicacies which sometimes don't add anything to the meaning of the scenes and are totally gratuitous.",7.0,Anonymous,History

She has a natural talent for expressing powerful emotions without a lot of elocution. Her interactions with Farrell and Rolfe are as powerful as they are economical.

The actors fit into their roles very well, but I still think of Mel Gibson when I think of John Smith.

I am not sorry I watched it, but if I had to sit through all of it without my fast forward button, I would grown tired of it, fast.It is not a date movie, an educational movie, a girl night movie or a rainy day cry fest movie.

Probably the Greatest Film Ever Made in the U.S.A.,"This is art at its highest level of achievement. Viewing such excellence makes me proud to be an American.As evocative and yearning as the greatest poems, as sane as the most profound meditation, and as deep as the most sumptuous dream, ""The New World"" is an achingly beautiful film. It is the most sensual ""no-nudity"" film you will ever see. The eroticism here reveres life and reaches out lyrically and sacredly to all creation.Christian Bale and Colin Farrell are powerfully present on-screen and give two of the best understated performances I've ever seen.God has blessed Q'Orianka Kilcher with great beauty and talent; her smile could warm ice to melt in Antarctica, and she is freshly sensual in an unspoiled way as only a young woman can be. Kilcher is excellent at quietly portraying the nearly impossible journey Pocahontas traveled socially, emotionally and spiritually. That she navigated through the great joys and sorrows of her short life is a testament to her strength and humanity.The cinematography is beautiful - with its natural setting, vivid colors and diffused lighting making objects and people almost palpable.When I say this movie is probably the finest ever made in the U.S.A., I do not mean to imply in any way that it resembles the glut of sausage mill product being extruded out of Hollywood. There are no silly car chases, no phony battles between purely good and purely evil characters, and no bankrupt moralizing which panders to a fawning, lazy audience. Thank God!A supreme achievement, ""The New World"" is the cinematic equivalent of swans drifting slowly on a lake as the fairest summer day of the year closes.As soon as it became available on blu-ray, I purchased it, because I wanted something this transcendent to have a place in my home.Thank you, Mr. Malick, for this peerless work of art!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Definitely worth watching.,"The New World is one of those ""got it all"" movies. Action, adventure, romance and drama. It contains a lot of questions about how people treat each other, and how we treat the environment surrounding us. The story being told is about the colonization of north America, and how this clash between the two cultures comes about. On one side we have the nature loving natives who are portrayed as being without any of the materialistic and possessional values that engulf the conquistadors, and vice-versa. Maintaining a constant feeling of suspense and interest, are almost completed if you're not defacto bored about scenes without dialog or killing. This isn't the kind of movie you absolutely have to watch a the cinema, as is doesn't have an overweight of great and spectacular scenes. The acting is great and the scenes are well proportioned regarding the storyline. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
This embarrassing film is only for 1st year film-school fanboys.,"Film-snobs of the worst kind, desperately grasping at straws in this ""style over substance"" piece of turd. That may seem harsh, but considering the ridiculous praise Terence Malick has gotten for his supposedly 'outstanding cinematography' on The New World, I don't feel like holding back any criticism. I hate this almost as much as I hate Crash (2004) and that's saying something.The New World is unbearably slow, and I am not some movie-goer with the maximum attention span for a 90 minutes action feature. It was so slow you stopped being involved with the story. Talk about a director who had NO IDEA what he was doing, so he just stationed the camera, shot a few trees blowing in the wind, put it in his movie to compensate for the poor writing and called it 'art' - and immediately, geek fan-boys creamed their pants. I would have loved to see Malick explore the myth-laden new continent with adventures and culture contrasts, and instead got some pseudo-introspective nature special.This film is simply not very good on any level. It is perhaps decent when it comes to acting, since even Colin Farrell managed to pull off a performance that wasn't all that bad. However, I am tired of Malick-fanboys claiming that he is some sort of ""visual poet"" and that The New World was full of deeper meaning that normal people ""just cannot grasp"". Malick is in fact highly amateurish in his visual approach and there is nothing original about the shots. He should do nature documentaries instead - because that is what the images look like, there's no 'oomph'. I appreciate visual directors with an edge and some originality to their style (Burton, Herzog, Green etc.) and I know one when I see one - and Malick isn't one. He either borrows or misuses styles.What he does wrong is - he lets his story facilitate the pointless nature visuals, instead of letting the visuals facilitate his story (like David Gordon Green). He went with leaves blowing in the wind because it's a very safe thing to do and easily labelled 'art'. Is it any good? No, not really. It's a chicken-sh!t cop-out. There is nothing captivating about the film. Just molded and ready for film-geek worship. Lastly, I worry about anyone who can sit and listen to those horribly cheesy voice-overs for two hours and not laugh their ass off.2/10",2.0,Anonymous,History
Massively pretentious impressionist film.,"You know that a film is going to be massively pretentious when it is all water and river shots from the first note of Wagner's Ring to the time you would expect the Jamesmaidens to burst into song. However, I was warned by my daughter, who had seen it a few years ago, and did not expect any rousing action. It was a dream, rather, told with the jumpiness, incoherence, and lack of explication you get in one. Most of the dialog was buried by music, except for the voice overs.The show bragged about authenticity, but the Powhatan tribe historically mostly went about nude, according to the contemporary drawings of them. Even a Pre-Raphaelite-appearing painting of Pocahontas saving John Smith has a breast exposed by an off the shoulder outfit.But, for authenticity, I was at the Jamestown archaeological site just last week. The movie had it nailed.Malick did what he did exceedingly well, communicating with light, facial expressions, motion, requiring the viewer to give himself over to the atmosphere he wrought. The actors carried out his design beautifully. I let him work his will on me. Somewhat. I should like to also see a good drama of the history, perhaps the equivalent of the first season of the ""Rome"" series.He who needs a plot and dialog will be bored out of his skull. This show ain't nothing' like what he was expecting, and he will have wasted the rental fee. He would be like an Academy judge dealing with the Impressionist painters' submissions in Paris a century ago.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Although the slow pace and restraint take away something they compliment and support a sense and sight of beauty,"It is the 17th Century and the English are expanding their Empire into new and undiscovered lands. Captain John Smith is in one such expedition and he is holed up in a hasty fort along with his superiors and men, defending themselves from the ""savages"". Smith ventures out with a party to try and trade with the natives but is overwhelmed and captured by them. Only the intervention of the king's daughter, Pocahontas, saves his life and sees him spared to teach her about his world. The pair develop a unspoken bond, with Smith taken by her beauty and innocence. However when he is returned to the fort he knows that the conflict will restart as they have no intention of leaving this land.Another reviewer states that it helps to know what you're getting into before you watch this so that you're not expecting some battle-filled epic. Those comments are valid if a little short-sighted because the truth is the name Terrence Malick should tell you what you need to know in regards this being quite a slow-paced but beautiful film and not one to come to for action-packed plotting and big battle sequences. In terms of narrative we are given the story with a very slight touch, almost like Malick is confident that this is something we should feel rather than just be shown. The ""rules"" of shooting that I read after seeing this confirmed what I suspected Â– that a lot of effort was put into the filming of the visuals and capturing the world that Smith et al stumbled into. Now this sounds like I'm talking about the ""aren't the native people beautiful"" film-making of A Man Called Horse, Dances with Wolves etc but this is not what this is. Instead the film just takes its time and allows everything to seep through with striking imagery and shots.Of course for many people the lack of strong narrative flow will be a problem and to be honest at times it was so for me. Long sections occasionally drag where very little happens or is spoken and although mostly the pace works, at times it really does not and I would have liked to have seen some cuts in some small sections Â– not that it is my place to suggest such! Malick draws out worthy and restrained performances from his cast that match the tone and feel of the film. Farrell and Bale really hold back and it is strange to see them being so restrained and quiet Â– but it works. Kilcher steals the film with a natural and peaceful performance that is the core of the film and key to convincing the audience as to why people were captivated by her. Studi, Thewlis, Chaplin and others all do solid support while the sharp-eyed Oz fan will spot Alvarez himself in a tiny role.The New World is not a film to come to in a rush or if you are a bit tense and looking for a film to quickly engage and hold you. Instead it is a film that is best suited just flowing over you. Does this make it perfect? Well of course not and those that have issues with the quiet and slow plot and pace are not wrong but actually right. They are however missing the point because these qualities are necessary to match the beautiful visuals and ""feel"" of the film, which are what made it worth seeing for me.",,Anonymous,History
"A beautiful movie giving form to the story of Pocahontas, John Smith and John Rolfe","First of all, this is not a movie based entirely on fact and truth. There are many inventions and many events that are not entirely chronological correct. I grew up adoring Pocahontas, and when I was almost six years old I watched the Disney version of the movie. Three years later, I watched the movie ""Pocahontas: The Legend"" which was disappointing but yet didn't stop my fascination for the story of Pocahontas. In 2000, when I was going to be eleven years old, I saw the famous painting of the engagement between Pocahontas and John Rolfe in the Capitol Hill, Washington D.C.This movie shouldn't be seen solely for historical truth; but rather solely for entertainment and its beauty. It's a fascinating and great story, yes, but the legend of Pocahontas varies depending on where the source came from. Also, most of the stories of Pocahontas has been invented, or romanticized to make it more interesting. Yet, the only facts that I can determine are true is that Pocahontas was a real person as well as John Smith and John Rolfe. But whether they actually were in love with her, and if she actually loved them we never can know. But what's true is that Pocahontas eventually married John Rolfe.Other than that, this movie can almost be called an art. The photography is so beautiful, and tends to stay at a point of scene a bit longer than most movies usually do, which give the movie a real, calm and thoughtful feeling. Unfortunately, it also leaves a lot of empty gaps in the movie, which makes the 2 hours and 15 minutes story feel a bit too long. Anyways, you feel as if you could identify with what the characters of the movie felt. This movie is so totally different the earlier versions, including the Disney movie.Like all the legends of Pocahontas, this movie starts with the Englishmen shipping ashore to the Virginia coast in 1607, and meets the naturals who first act very friendly and curiously. But what happens thereafter is too uncertain, and too loose based on too many theories and speculations. So, let's say the rest of movie is based on a lot of theories, a lot of mythological stories we've learned about Pocahontas and a lot of fiction, too, to make it more interesting.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Just another love story,"Though the movie is not bad by any means, it could have been easily set in fifty other historical situations and came out with the same effect. The love story leaves the viewer bored and the seeming emotionlessness of the characters creates a sense that the two main actors didn't take their roles seriously (Pocahontas certainly seemed emotional until a certain point, while Smith seemed to feel as if she could have been any harlot he could have had on the streets of London). Bale does seem compassionate but also seems to be a little apathetic. The lack of dialogue and explanation leaves the viewer wondering both why the characters acted how they did and at times what even happened. The soundtrack is generic, bland, unmemorable and sometimes out of place, which would not be such an offense if the movie had not had such a focus on emotion and surrealism.Historical inaccuracies are not excessive, but the portrayal of the natives is downright offensive - jumping around and using war cries at inappropriate times as if to portray them as monkeys. Again, the lack of explanation makes it appear as if the natives did not actually help the settlers through the winter or help them with their crops. The shift from downright militancy between the groups to a leader allowing himself to be taken across the sea with only one of his tribesmen is unexplained, as well.The movie is not without positive aspects, however. The scenery is beautiful and historically accurate, though some of the settings are unexplained in the context of the plot (i.e. it is unexplained why certain people went / lived here or there). The directing is dynamic and generally flows nicely together, and John Smith's communal attitude toward his direction of the colony is accurately portrayed.I gave the movie a '6' because it was regularly confusing, sometimes drawn out with unnecessary scenes, the soundtrack was pedestrian, the movie didn't make you care as much for the characters as you should have been able to and the portrayal of the natives was surprisingly condescending.I would suggest seeing this movie if you want to see a love story and are fairly interested in Jamestown and Pocahontas, but be warned that the historical content basically stops halfway through where the characters' dull emotions start to take the stage.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Stunning, an achievement only Malick is now capable of.","I thought THE THIN RED LINE was a great film; to rate THE NEW WORLD is to wonder whether it's actually better than THE THIN RED LINE or just as good as it. Either way, this film is an utter achievement on the highest level. When other film-makers are giving us two-dimensional cartoon characters parading as deep psychological insights, Malick gives us pure poetry and majesty - a trip into the past and way beyond. Apart from being a unique experience, this film is beautifully shot, beautifully written, extremely intelligent, sensitively scored, powerful with performances beyond anything we have seen this year in cinema. It is, quite simply, mesmerising.Malick has admirably steered clear of a torrent of pointless, immature dialogue in favour of a harshly realistic and yet poetically transcendent film created virtually entirely from image, sound, music, gesture. What is said is only what needs to be said. Again, a refreshing change from the dribbling verbal diarrhoea exhibited in so many other films.Q'Orianka Kilcher in the lead role is an absolute revelation. What a magical, deeply-felt performance from a talented young lady who surely promises to be one of the great actresses of her generation. An emotional, utterly beguiling characterisation in a film so admirably conceived and so intelligently executed.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Very historically accurate,"Many of the artifacts found in the Jamestown dig were represented. The fort was very accurate, and the well - to placement and location.I liked the scene where it showed some of the colonists looking for gold - that was the general mindset that a lot of them had on the voyage over.Notice the brief shot of the glass firing bowl and furnace. The venetian beads, the hatchets.Great costumes, but at least 20 minutes too long.One thing I did like was the educational resources on the website. They are nice for homeschoolers.It seemed like kinda a chick flick - but as a chick flick could have stood a few more cute little native baby shots. Those were adorable, and helped the boredom factor some.The cinematography was great all around. The focus on the trees when Captain John Smith was in the water before he was captured showed the same trees that a core sample was taken from that proved the colonists settled during the worst drought in hundreds of years in Virginia. It was just....boring.......but only because it was too long.",7.0,Anonymous,History
historical?,"From Wikipedia:""Historical records do not suggest that Smith and Pocahontas were lovers, or even that she was a suitable age for such a relationship. The romance is featured only (but repeatedly) in fictional versions of their relationship (such as the 1995 animated film by Walt Disney and the 2005 film, The New World). The first romance was written about them in the early 19th century, suggesting the story's mythic appeal. Accounts of such a romance have been repeated in films made in the United States as late as 2009.""Of course, who can trust wikipedia?

Film as Art,"Terrence Malick produces art. It is important to understand this when considering watching one of his movies. If you're looking for a night out eating popcorn, slugging down a coke and giving your brain a break give his films a skip. If you want to challenge the way you perceive reality, open your heart and gain appreciation for the beauty of life, don't look anywhere else.The New World is not a love story, any more than it is a historical epic. Rather the film is a slow, profound meditation on innocence, the balance of nature and that odd disturbance of equilibrium that is so characteristic of Western civilization. The acting in Malick's films is absolutely superb, and he brings out evocative and sincere performances from all his actors. I have heard comments that this film is merely a complaint, but I think this reveals a basic ignorance of the fact that Malick allows viewers to reach their own understanding and insights from his images, and his scripts are free of polemic or propaganda of any sort.Another common complaint against Malick is the length of his films. This once again betrays a fundamental lack of insight into his work. Malick's films play out slowly precisely so one can tune into the deep current of emotion and beauty in his work. The length of the films appears to me to be a subtle indictment of the haste, superficiality and mindless stimulation of modernity. People who think otherwise are welcome to challenge themselves with a 50 Cent music video on MTV.There is no point in comparing this film to other releases this year. It stands alone, an expression of integrity, passion and the peaks of cinematic endeavour. If you like it, check out the Thin Red Line and Days of Heaven.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Great artistic film, bad for entertainment","""The New World"" is one of those films that you either ""get"" or don't.Despite a serious lack of direction or character development (i. e. if you don't know the Pocahontas story through to her death, you'll probably be confused through at least 1/3 of the movie), not withstanding a TERRIBLE job in editing (many scenes seem literally thrown together), this movie does have its good points.The best quality, for sure, is the cinematography, which is absolutely STUNNING. If you are a fan of seeing pretty images of the moving picture, you'll be very happy with this film. The nature shots are utterly engrossing and are beautifully crafted as the backdrop of 1607 Virginia.Some events are slightly exaggerated in regards to the historical value of the film (i. e. the relationship between Smith and Pocahontas), but these inaccuracies are irrelevant to many of the other historical continuities including (but not limit to) native rituals and life.Another fair quality of this film are the actors involved. With contributions from big names as Wes Studi, David Thewlis, Christopher Plummer, Christian Bale and Colin Farrell, the movie-goer should at least appreciate that there must have been -something- regarding the directors vision that was highly appealing to prompt their association with this film. Qorianka Kilcher is delightful in the role of Pocahontas--there are moments in the film when one can almost feel for themselves her inner struggles as the movie progresses. This is a good introductory role for her, and I'm eager to see how her career will develop.Overall, I give this movie 6/10 stars. It isn't wholly terrible--as a film for film's sake. If you walk into this movie with the expectation of being entertained, save your money and either wait for the discount theater or DVD release. If you walk into this movie in the mindset that you are about to witness a quintessential art-flick and maintain an open mind about the directors vision, you just might enjoy it.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Beautifully boring,"The image is astounding, the audience suddenly feels like discovering Virginia in the 17th century, or feels like what it has been for Pocahontas to see London. So that is great, and if I had to judge only the atmosphere and the cinematography, I would give the movie a 10/10. But a movie is also a story. Here, the story is a true story (I don't know - and don't care - how much it is accurate to the original story), and the script tells it to us in a quite ""arty"" way : while being told about the fort's discipline, John Smith thinks about Pocahontas (so we here about the fort and watch the girl running in the bushes). Lots of ""off voice"", with a quite tired tone, it is poetic, poetic and boring like hell. I had to end watching the DVD using the fast-forward button : I couldn't stand any more.

In the slowness, there is story. Packed with story. Not always very much dialogue, but there is story, nonetheless. After the first half hour, I wanted to experience the film and allowed myself the pleasure, not just watch it. I can also see where this film may not get much attention.

The New World sucks!,"I heard that Terence Malick directed a film after the hyped up but only semi-good THin Red Line. However The New World is not much better, actually it falls short of capturing the feeling of the era which The Thin Red Line at least did, though it was boring too, just like this film. The New World tells the story of JOhn Smith and pocahontas, and the struggle between the early settlers of Jamestown and local native Americans.

Beautiful and crushing,"For about the last thirty minutes of Terrence Malick's The New World, I'm a mess. The emotional connection that Malick creates between me, the audience, and his characters is so complete that the final emotional motions that the princess Pocahontas goes through as she finishes out her story affect me at levels I find very rare in film. On top of that, the production is so intricate, the editing so evocative, and the performances so restrained but emotional that I find the mass audience resistance to The New World both completely flabbergasting and entirely understandable. This is an art film, for sure, but it works just so very well.This movie is about the story of Pocahontas and John Smith much the same way that The Thin Red Line is about the Battle of Guadalcanal. In other words, not really. Yes, Pocahontas is the main character, John Smith and John Rolfe play large supporting roles, and we witness the early clash of civilizations around the founding and formative years of Jamestown, but they're window dressing to the actual story Terrence Malick was trying to tell which is about the loss of innocence, or, to put it in an idiom that more closely aligns with his overall thematic obsessions, it's about the expulsion from paradise, from Eden.I've read critiques, intelligent critiques, mind you, of The New World that talk about how Malick over-idealizes the natives, or the naturals as the English call them in the film, of 1607 Virginia, but I feel like that's missing the point. There's a larger thematic point about the effervescent nature of utopia on Earth, but there's also a character point. When John Smith is allowed to live by his native captors, he's put in the hands of Pocahontas, a fourteen year old girl who sees nothing around her but nature, which she calls Mother, in all its glory. She's almost a sprite in a certain way where she moves with the wind and the water around her. She acts as Smith's translator and view into the world of the natives, and because his lens is built a certain way he fails to see the more realistic side of the naturals.There's a moment as Smith is brought into the longhouse, ready for judgment and death, when, in the corner of the frame, a warrior handles a human hand cut from its arm. We also see other examples of the natives desiring possessions like a copper kettle that conflicts with his voiceover statements while he was in his own personal Eden when he said that they had no sense of possession. His sense of utopia is built on perception, but like the treehouse in Badlands or the village in The Thin Red Line, this utopia is of the world and contains the seeds of its own destruction.So, the English arrive in Virginia and set up a colony, and we can see the normal progression of plot familiar to the Pocahontas story. Smith gets captured and saved. The English nearly starve in the winter. Pocahontas brings them food to keep them from starving. Smith goes away, Rolfe shows up, Rolfe and Pocahontas marry, and they go to England where Pocahontas dies. The movie isn't that terribly interested in the details of the stories on their own. Every event is used as a vehicle for Malick's thematic ideas as carried through by his characters. We don't need films to act as our history textbooks, so Malick using the Pocahontas story to explore his own ideas is a wonderful fit.One of the interesting things about the film's structure is that up until a little over the halfway point, John Smith is by far the most central of characters. We mostly see Pocahontas through his eyes, getting smaller moments away from him for her here and there, but it makes sense when you see what Malick is trying to do. Smith is the one who discovers and experiences that new innocence and paradise on Earth when he arrives in America. He loses it before Pocahontas does, and when he's called away by the king to look for a north passage to the Indies, it's her turn to feel like everything is lost.Not only has Pocahontas been cast out from her tribe, but now she's left along among strangers with strange ways in a place that had been her home but now no longer looks like it. Instead of the forest, she lives in a house. When she receives the false information that Smith has died, she has literally nothing left. Her entire world has been taken from her. What does she end up doing? She ends up moving forward. She gets a servant woman, Mary, who helps her learn how to read and write. John Rolfe appears and courts her to the point of marriage. She rebuilds as a new woman in a new world. The first time she smiles and chases after some flying insects on her tobacco farm with Rolfe, it's a marvelous moment. She feels like she's finally becoming alive again.The final section of the film deals with Pocahontas going to England with Rolfe and their son. It's here that the movie fully embraces the idea of the new world, especially in how we also follow Opechancanough who goes to count the white men and find this God that the English are always talking about. The wilds of America were beautiful and untamed, but the gardens and cathedrals of England contain their own awe inspiring beauty for the newly arrived man. It's also here that Pocahontas, now called Rebecca, meets John Smith again, and this heartbreaking scene is the core of the film.Smith still clings to the paradise he knew with her years before, but she finds that she's become detached from the same place. Smith has nothing else, feeling like he's talking to her for the first time, but Pocahontas is able to see beyond it, beyond the dream. She has a loving husband and a small son, both of whom are very real and very present, and that's what she can cling to. She has something real, but all Smith has is a dream. And even then, Malick gives us her final spiritual moments as she dances around a rich English country estate in her full gown as though she were just the same sprite from the beginning. She's still the same woman, but fuller now that she's found something real to cling onto.When I first started writing about movies on the Internet, I formalized my thinking on how all stories are built. They consist of four major elements: character, plot, style, and theme. Every story has all four in different amounts, and every audience member has a preference, though they may not be able to vocalize it this way. Malick's films are heavily stylized, for sure, but they have very firm foundations in character and theme. Plot is incidental to his moviemaking, but for many, I think most, filmgoers, plot is the single most important element of storytelling to them. When they encounter a film that has no plot, they think there's no story or that nothing's happening, and they disengage. I find this unfortunate because someone like Malick is telling stories, just in a different way than many people expect. Opening up to someone like Malick can lead to rapturous experiences like every time I watch The New World. Malick may have a process that almost no one else can get their minds around (stories of Malick pissing off actors, directors of photography, and even composers are kind of the stuff of legend), but his end products show an artist in full command of his art, even if his methods are far from traditional.The New World is a work of art. It's one of my favorite films. It hits me emotionally like very few films can. It is the work of a visionary and a genius. I adore this film.",10.0,Anonymous,History
It was a new way of making movies!!!,The New World was not your average movie. The filming was amazing it gave you a sense of freedom. The acting seemed as if you were really watching these two lovers for real. Oh and the music was beyond belief.This Movie is about the growth of Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher). When you first meet her she has no cares. Then she falls in love with Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell). Then is taken away from Smith for a while sending her into depression. By the end of the movie she resolves all her problems and becomes a peaceful person.The filming breaks all filming laws and takes the most extreme and strange shots that you might hate or might love. If you hate it look past that and follow the story.,7.0,Anonymous,History

nuances  of  old  story,"at first sigh - new film about Pocahontas. in fact a film by Terence Malick. a huge fruit basket. extraordinary images. superb music. the story. and something else, out of words. it may be emotion, faith, desire, search. but it is heart of this wonderful movie. a film about an old story. but with different nuances because it presents nuances of desire and answer to basic questions. it can be a Romeo and Juliet version or Jane Eyre adaptation. but it is little more. a delicate map. a fragile web spider. a song. and a dialog with a goddess. nothing else. only a veil in wind. and force of a story in new colors. nothing new. nothing special. only a state of soul.",,Anonymous,History
Thoughtful and Beautiful,"Along with my brother and my nephew, I watched ""The New World"" late into the night. It was visually stunning in so many ways. For me a big part of the beauty of the film was the screen presence and artful performance of Q'Orianka Kilcher (How do you pronounce her first name anyway?)Many here say the movie is slow. Perhaps it is. But this film is very subtle, it may not be possible to speed this up and still tell the story the same way. The movie held my attention all through. Other movies considered slow have almost bored me to insanity. In the case of this film, the performances held my interest, and the pacing was right for the story being told.Was it accurate? We only have the European's letters and notes to go by. There is no documentation from the natives who were there, obviously. History will never know Matoaka's (aka Pocahontas) real thoughts about her life. I think that would make a hell of a movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Poetry!,"Terrence Malick delivers Poetry with 'The New World'. A riveting, heart-melting film, with a historical touch. It may not cater to everyone's taste, but for Mailck's fans, like me, there is almost everything here.'The New World' Synopsis: The story of the English exploration of Virginia, and of the changing world and loves of Pocahontas.'The New World' has strong characters, that lead the narratively firmly. Malick's Screenplay isn't just a Pocahontas legend, its also about mother nature, its about love, its about war & violence. The film flows beautifully & Emmanuel Lubezki's Mesmerising Cinematography makes the film a visual delight!Malick's Direction is poetic. He's a master at his craft, who combines nature in his storytelling. And he does it so effortlessly. 'The New World' is amongst his most sensitive works to date. Art & Costume Design are fabulous. Editing is perfect (I have watched the 135-minute version). A Special Mention for the legendary James Horner, who's score is simply enchanting.Performance-Wise: Colin Farrell gives his all. The supremely talented actor is subtle & throughly believable. Christian Bale has a small role, but he enacts it remarkably. Christopher Plummer adds weight to his part. But its Q'orianka Kilcher who steals the show. As Pocahontas, the performer brings life to a difficult, tender part & shines from start to end.On the whole, 'The New World' is truly a memorable piece in filmmaking.

Sadly inadequate,"I had high hopes for this film, and unfortunately I was very disappointed.While the visuals are stunning and the actors are well cast for the most part, this film is at least 45 minutes too long (too many shots of trees and grass) and is excruciatingly inaccurate historically. While a 'relationship' between Pocahontas and John Smith makes for an touching myth, for a big budget film to perpetuate this fairy tale is unfortunate to say the least. One would have hoped that Terrace Malick would have done a little bit of research before writing the script.Colin Farrell and Christian Bale make for yummy eye-candy, but it's not worth $8.00.

"""The New World"" captures ineffable truths through sight, sound, and very few words...","From the breathtaking opening minutes of the filmÂ—an extended montage sequence of sensory crescendo (to the music of Wagner's Das Rheingold prologue)Â—we know that The New World is not a conventional film. We do suspect it is a Terrence Malick film, however, and during the next two hours+ of 65mm nature photography, hushed voice-overs, elliptical editing, jump-cut storytelling, hyper-attentive sound, and scarcely little dialogue, we become convinced of this fact. Like Malick's previous films (especially The Thin Red Line), World is about the raw and unique experience of cinemaÂ—in all its sight, sound, and splendorÂ—rather than simply ""storytelling on a screen."" Indeed, plot is far from the focus for Malick, who is much more interested in philosophy, metaphysics, and the art of film-making. Even so, ""artistic"" does little justice to describe Malick's creation, which isÂ—beyond being a wrenching, evocative story of discovery and lossÂ—beautiful and true in ways that most ""artsy"" efforts can only reach for.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I'd Rather Watch Rocks Grow,"What a horrible abomination of a movie. This was so boring, I wish I'd watched the entire thing on fast forward. I must have missed the point entirely, if there was one. I suppose it was something about love, but that point was butchered before it was displayed. I daresay I could scribe every word of dialogue contained in this movie on a single scrap of paper. The actors all moved slower than a zombie in a low-budget horror film made by stoners. The only description of the movie I can offer is that it's a type of high-end, college indie-film art project on steroids. This film could easily be substituted for your sleepy-time nature sounds CD. There was plenty of nature to be seen, tranquilizing and beautiful, and you're better off focusing on that than the story. If you watch this movie for a good plot, you'll find yourself choking an employee at your local video rental store, demanding your money back, and screaming, ""Why, dear God, why?"" The only emotion I could convey in relation to any of the characters was flat-out aggravation. I did not feel sorry for anyone in the movie, because any time any misfortune occurred, I found myself thinking, ""Well, that probably would have gone better if the stupid bloke had just said something instead of staring at the camera with complete apathy.""

With moments of greatness...,"The new World is the 4th Malick film I have seen, and just like always, it is visually-great, but yet not as much as The Thin Red Line and Days of Heaven especially. Malick does know how to show romance, as the romance between Pocahontas and both of her guys is very well constructed and edited. Scenes like this give the film a real power. Also, it is not as incoherent or as overwhelming as The Thin Red Line (but then again I saw the shortest version, the 135 minute version).Like always, there is some ambition beneath the surface, but at this point nothing here feels that original. Yes, the romance is well-made, perhaps the most affecting romance in a Malick film. Also, Q'orianka Kilcher manages to be the stand-out among big stars like Christian Bale and Colin Farrell. She barely speaks a word, but her effect is there. The film is highly flawed though, and in a way it is not better than The Thin Red Line. It is more consistent, but none of it hit me as hard as the big war scenes in The Thin Red Line or the flashbacks to the wife.Ultimately, I do recommend it, but it stands together with The Thin Red Line (whose rating dropped to a 7 by now) as good films, ambitious and visually great, but neither have a real lasting power that his earlier films Days of Heaven and Badlands have.",,Anonymous,History

Christian Bale delivers here as well. Surprisingly, the only person who disappointed me here was Wes Dudi. Is he like the default Indian for every Native American movie?

THE NEW WORLD ( 2005 ),"I love the beginning of the film that slowly drifts into tranquillity in beautiful film imagery and music: The three ships arriving in view from greenery land where the sun captures the light in shadow from the sky: The unusual dance movements and playfulness of the Native Americans' -'inquisitive and gentle like deer' -it all intrigued and captured my attention:""They are gentle, loving, faithful, lacking in guile and trickery. ""The words denoting, 'lying, envy, slander and forgiveness' -have never been heard: ""They have no sense of possession. "" 'Real' -is what I thought was a dream.""And yet, in a dreamlike quality and tale, this is how the story unfolds -but how very different this film would have been in mood without the haunting and lovely musical score: from a long journey to form a new settlement into a colony among Native Americans'?The words are often spoken in quietly voiced, and imagined thoughts -in confrontation, in harmonisation to communicate in division of languages between two very different cultures from ancestral nations:There are no horrors to witness to unsettle the viewer in alarming terror: but there are hardships, hunger, fighting and poor discipline, and a constant threat in fear from the natives to be conquered, to be colonized in control of their freedom?I like the eventual pageant meeting at the Royal Court with King James and the daughter of Chief Powhatan: 'Pocahontas!' -the girl, hypnotic to mesmerising beauty to Captain John Smith -and to the camera lens itself!The beautiful filming and music drifts and lingers along in 172 mins of viewing time -and a piano concerto by Mozart ( no.23 ) is prominent throughout to enhance a sadness of a love story that I had not mentioned -but in a longing desire that the film seems intent to convey!Directed by Terrence Malick

"Excellent film-making, but boring topic...","This movie was really well made. There is the beautiful nature, beautiful the look of the movie is in its whole way. The camera is awesome too. The acting by the way is acceptable too, ...for all Farell-haters ; ) The director describes step-by-step the all known Pocahontas-story. And thats the point, I don't like. The story is very limited. From the first minute, you know what will happen. Thats the same problem, on my opinion, that King Kong had. Great film-making, but a boring, all known story. Nevertheless the director brings the plot very sensitive in little steps to the audience and the characters are developed in details. There Tallick uses an explaining voice in the background, which tells us what the main-characters think and how they feel. Especially in that point - and in many more ways - the ""New World"" reminds me so much to ""The thin red line"", which is also so beautifully shot, but the better movie because of its content.After all, I would say, you cant say that Tallick did something wrong. But the story itself lacks of content.I would give it a 6-7.I hope, I made not too many mistakes in writing this...i'm German ; )",7.0,Anonymous,History
Film as Art,"Although this film is a masterpiece, I can at least understand why some do not like it. If you're conditioned for a short attention span, and constantly need explosions and dialogue to keep you interested, you probably will not like this movie.Most of Malick's movies are an acquired taste, and this one is no different. He just goes about film-making in a very unique and different way from what today's movie-watchers are used to. He tells a story through pictures, not words. His inspirations come from old, silent films as much as they do from more modern artistic masterpieces, like Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon. In fact, Barry Lyndon is a very, very good comparable to this movie, and this movie's final scenes in London, in my opinion, are a not so subtle homage to it. Both Barry Lyndon and The New World have simple, classical plots (Lyndon being the classic tragedy, and TNW being the a classic romantic drama), and there are few if any unexpected plot twists or surprises. Christopher Nolan films these are not. Both films, however, make their mark by telling their stories perfectly--impeccable cinematography, art design, and costume design, a meticulously-crafted score, and perfect acting. In order to put yourself in the proper mindset to view a Malick movie, you need to sit down with the expectation that you are reading a picturebook, not a novel. To Malick, the entire point of cinema is to tell you a story visually. Instead of looking for dialogue, let yourself get immersed in the imagery and let your own imagination fill in the gaps.With that said, this is the most beautiful film I have ever seen. Malick's films have always been visual masterpieces, but this is his first pairing with Emmanuel Lubezki--who I think is the greatest cinematographer in the history of film. The way he captures the beauty of nature, and the way he makes the actors' souls come alive with his camerawork is unparalleled. The classical music score fits perfectly with the production. While some people may think the plot is slow due to minimal dialogue, the narrative arc of the story is driven by eliciting viewer's reactions to its philosophical undertones. What is love? Is it romantic excitement, or is it dependability? What is the destiny of these two cultures coming together for the first time? Will the guilt that John Smith feels as he contemplates that destiny become a wedge between him and Pocahontas? Will this make him feel not good enough for her? Is he being selfish or selfless in leaving to go back to England? Brave or a coward? Is there any salvation in a world such as this? Any power organizing this level of beauty? Anything certain or meaningful to latch on to?During the slower parts of the film, these are some of the questions that are meant to occupy a viewer's mind, while being lulled into a trance by the film's elemental beauty. The plot, in this sense, is the most emotionally authentic one I can recall seeing since maybe Field of Dreams, as Malick guides the viewer to thoughtful answers to each of the above. When you couple this philosophical plot perfection with the film's visuals, you get that ""I have to cry it's so beautiful"" feeling at at least three or four different points along the way. (I also have to add here that I'm a guy that likes his share of Schwarzenegger explosion/shoot 'em up/action films as well).Malick's films require a bit of effort by the viewer, and require a bit of a trained eye and mind to be accessible, much like appreciation for classical music, jazz, or progressive rock can require a trained ear. I believe that is why the beauty of this film goes over the head of a non-negligible number of viewers. If some folks wish to characterize that as high-minded and/or self-indulgent, they can, but if you can overcome that cynicism, you will be handsomely rewarded by a majestic work of art with unparalleled beauty.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Why did they make this movie?,"I expected this movie to be a cross between Braveheart and Last of the Mohicans. Unfortunately it proved to be a cross between a boring storyline mixed with weak fighting scenes.As a drama it's weak. As an action story it's weaker. As a historical tale it's even worse. The only saving grace is an A-list cast...Colin Farrell and Christian Bale. Sadly, none of their characters are explored in any great depth. Coupled with constant Shakespearian a-la-""how do I love the"" monologues, this has to be the worst movie I've seen in recent years...and I've seen Gigli! Stay away from this movie. Don't rent it.

A beautiful viewing experience,"It takes little knowledge to understand the future impact a film like this will leave behind. While many people feel the movie is rather pointless in it's scope, the juxtaposition of images, voices and music will create a visual experience that will be hard to equal any time soon. While film school students strive to be the next big thing in cinema, people like Terrence Malick make films that turn the industry on its head and makes them take a hard look at the product they create.The New World by all accounts is an amazing film. The depth of space and detail made the extra cost of using 65mm film all the more worthwhile. Subtle details and colors that seem devoid in most 35mm films indicate the artistry and scope the filmmakers put into this film, making us forget about the complexities of the modern world. The film grabs you right out of the gate, from the first moments of John Smith's Christ-like imprisonment to the last beautiful shots, it leaves one to guess why Malick isn't more prolific in his films.This film also leaves a deep impression of good and evil, once again falling quite nicely into Malick's need to juxtapose the frailties of good with the savagery of evil. While ad campaigns try to pass this off as some cheap Titanic knock-off just to sell a few tickets, don't believe it.This is a one of a kind film, comparable only to The Thin Red Line, and years from now, the lucky few who watched the film in theaters will carry fond memories.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Flowing tone poem with choppy editing.,"First of all, I like long historical movies. If they are well done, as ""The New World"" was meant to be, I feel that I am actually living in the Indian village up river or in colonial Jamestown. It is a long movie, as many have noted already, and it not for everyone's taste. However, what made it uncomfortably long for me and what ultimately irritated me was the horrible hack job done by the editor to get it ready for prime time. The editor could and should have cut some of the repetitive love scenes -- we get the idea. But there was so much jumping around between incidents with no explanation about how and why things were happening that I had to turn to my history book to make the connections that should have been in the film, and probably were before it was released. Such a great deal of painstaking effort went into the making of ""The New World"" that I wish the pieces could be put back together so that it could flow as the river.",7.0,Anonymous,History

I'm sure that certain liberties were taken in the story, but that is to be expected since very little was documented about this initial contact in Virginia.The music plus the cinematography is so soothing and beautiful. Imagine yourself in 1607 coming upon a new land. Or imagine yourself being one of the ""naturals"" seeing these floating houses arrive in your area.It's fascinating to see the culture clash here. Although it's sad that European disease and greed wiped out the happy, thriving indigenous culture that was already established here, it is still a fascinating story.",,Anonymous,History
Genesis of genocide,"This is a tough movie to get through, mainly because it tries to be as historically accurate as it can. You can easily get annoyed by the narrated thoughts which tend to drag a little. Having said that this is the pilgrim story of the American excuse - or English excuse for transporting the desperation and greed of the old world to the new.Pocahontas is a classic legend based on true history, this film is a beautiful interpretation (although you should always consider the propaganda aspect). If you are into history you have to respect the efforts made here. It shows the old world as the corrupt but hopeful thing it was and also reflects on the corruption of the new world by that invasion.There is definitely something tragic about the whole thing 'Don't trust me' says Captain Smith and if you study history you say yeah right! On the whole it is an extremely well made film dealing with the American (Americ - guy from Wales) thanksgiving bullshit but adding the true indigestion that follows.A must see for historians and those that can suffer such bitter lessons of history.

Beautiful scenery mixed with bad sound,"In order to say something good about this movie, I will first say the location was great, the scenery was beautiful, and the soundtrack was one of the few things I could hear clearly. Not to take anything away from Colin, he needs to learn to deliver his lines without mumbling and in the general direction of the mic. The leading lady was a real gem and once she learns to speak up will hopefully replace some of the plastic leading ladies that are out in Hollywood today.

A Visual Poem,"I have seen all Malick's film and it is still too early to say whether it is his best movie, it is certainly a contender.The film worked its magic on me. I sat back and fell into Malick's milieu. The imagery was stunning. But it was far more than a pretty film. The courtship scene was protracted, but all the more effective because of it. His elliptical narrative and his preoccupation with touch coupled with the characters short flashbacks worked wonderfully. The subtext of the film (and most of his films to be honest) about civilised man's destructive approach to the world around him, was there but he didn't hit the viewer over the head with it - a la Oliver Stone.After seeing the movie I felt a mixture emotions. Firstly I felt invigorated by having seen an artist working at the peak of his powers bring a vision to life. He appeared to have complete control over the film and New Line seem to have given him a carte blanche. with it. However I was aware that this kind of film - with Hollywood's dwindling profits will be the first to go. The studios have new problems to encounter - see Soderbergh's 'Bubble' - and films that have artistic value but don't maximise profits and demographics won't, I feel, get made. The New World is not a popcorn movie. Yet the amount of criticism levelled against it because it doesn't conform to today's dominant idiom within film-making (the quick-cut, rock soundtrack, no-brainer), seems quite pathetic. It seems mediocrity is the king, deified to such a degree that anything that doesn't fall within its parameters must be ridiculed. Yes the film's NARRATIVE is slow, because it isn't a narrative-based film. It is a cinematic poem. And like a poem it employs, at times, repetition and mood rather than story.If you think Armageddon was great, there is nothing for you here. Leave it (and me) alone. For the rest of us The New World is art of the highest order. Watch. Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"New World, Old Story","I imagine that Terrence Malick, like his characters in ""The New World,"" takes pleasure in running frenetically about in new, beautiful places; he gropes and pets and feels all that is around him, taking it all in with one fresh, innocent gasp. His new film is photographed in his trademark sumptuousness, and when Europeans accustomed to castles see straw huts in meadows and Native Americans accustomed to straw huts see castles in metropoli, you inhale that same rich breath. The anthropological fascination that Malick channels into the first brushes between the two peoples is astounding. One sequence in particular Â– John Smith's taste of life among the ""savages"" and his first encounter with Pocahontas Â– is, perhaps, the movie's emotional high point. Anyone who can remember summers at the lake or simply has a penchant to frolic about in fields is enticed, and the courtship between the two lovers Â– demonstrated through touch more than talk Â– is lovely to the point of being affecting; it is like flowers ripening in the springtime. Unfortunately, the blossoms only open so much.The movie remains a pretty thing to look at Â– a pictorial representation of the past the way that ""2001"" was of the future Â– but from there on the dramatics become wobbly. For two more hours, the plot revolves around the couple trying to regain that initial high, and when their relationship doesn't deliver, neither does the film. The majestic Wagner overture, which sets off the tone of wonderment with such promise, seems like a cheat. Smith (Colin Farrell) returns to the Jamestown settlement, the only ugly setting in the entire movie. His fellow colonists are all whiney, belligerent cockneys who Â– until the later, spontaneous appearance of Christian Bale Â– are almost entirely indistinguishable from one another. They do, however, provide a needed break from the monotonous, poetic soliloquies that Smith and his Indian princess (Q'Orianka Kilcher) deliver on the voice over track. Some of their gentle, archaic monologues are helpful in establishing the romantic souls of their sayers; they necessarily explicate the differing points of view had by the two peoples. But when Pocahontas is exiled to the white men Â– whose outpost is now, thanks to the natives, just as pretty as the rest of the production design Â– and when she seeks out Smith beforehand, we are dismayed to discover that these muffled trifles are all that is exchanged between the lovers in person as well. That is the extent of the central relationship of the entire movie: whispered sweet nothings.To match the banality of their old-fashioned dialogue, the principals play as stiff, wide-eyed romantics who have a lust for beauty, but are otherwise hollow. Newcomer Kilcher is able to convey interior pathos rather well, but she is about the only person in this film who the director allows to emote; Colin Farrell, who actually can act, is stiff as a board for the supposedly rebellious professional soldier. His eyes are puffy, and his mouth, behind unkempt facial hair, perpetually droops. When the focus shifts from him to his girl, his comatose nature is somewhat excused: he's a warrior-poet but also a wanderer; he should've never let her love him. The storyline is nothing more than the soap opera of a man who cannot commit and his weepy paramour who'll nevertheless keep her darling's place set at the dinner table.After Smith embarks to find the Northwest Passage, he has his broken-hearted girl notified that he has drowned. The grieving Pocahontas is Anglicized, baptized and rechristened as Rebecca (her birth name is, as I recall, never given during the film Â– probably so that people don't think this is just a rehash of the Walt Disney cartoon). John Rolfe's (Christian Bale) subsequent courtship with her has some of the sweetness that came with her early days with her previous John, but the latter affair pans out to be as formal as a business luncheon. Bale's role at least proves that the movie's premise is not to show that every Englishman/Westerner is just some ill-mannered invader unworthy of the Native Americans' enlightened lifestyle. For better or for worse, he's but a good, bland man.Malick never asks the question of whether white man should have ever stepped foot in this country. The closest he comes to addressing this is the contrast between the early, floundering colony Â– which consists basically of forlorn hay huts lopped on goopy, barren mud Â– and the paradisiacal native enclave. But Jamestown gets a make-over half-way through when new settlers prosper and beautify the place. And Malick makes Jacobean England Â– the invaders' home turf Â– in its own way as attractive as virginal Virginia. The only sources of sorrow are unrequited love and failed crops; the specter of imperialism is barely hinted at. Even Rebecca nÃ©e Pocahontas doesn't seem upset about her forced expatriation from the world she was reared in; any possible commentary that her unique situation should offer is bizarrely omitted.It only seems right that Malick doesn't Â– and perhaps can't Â– make any species of political statement. He's much too busy gallivanting through the scenery and noticing again, for the first time, how lovely it all looks.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Terence Malick Fails Once Again.,"Although NEW WORLD is a refreshing change from the low grade trash Hollywood has dished-out the past two years, other people's failures don't make this a good picture. There's is, nonetheless, a lot of good things in this movie; which at least tries to give an accurate picture of early American history. We also have an Academy Award level portrayal by the girl playing Pocahontas. Absurdly sparse dialog is sometimes sharply effective. For example, Pocahontas' last few words with Captain John Smith. But there's no way of getting around the sheer lack of realistic emotion by most players: When food arrives at a time when the colony is starving, nobody raises their voice or shows any other excitement. Same in the battle scenes. Nobody shouts, let alone talks. Nobody says, Here come the Indians, or Watch Out, or anything.",6.0,Anonymous,History

The dialog is silly, attempting to paint John Smith as an emo kid in a man's body who doesn't have a clue what is going on most of the time.Not even Christian Bale can save this, and to make sure, he's kept out of the 2 hour, 15 min film until the last 20 minutes. Then he shows up with no introduction, stands around looking gorgeous but doing nothing much, and delivering the same wheezing voice-over that Colin Farrell did through the first two hours.There are long stretches where you have no idea what is going on. There are long stretches where you don't care what is going on. The whole thing would have made a beautifully photographed short. A full-length feature should have never happened.",1.0,Anonymous,History
To those who don't buy the Malick-as-reclusive-genius patter...,"See The New World anyway. To establish my low place on the Malick-worshipping spectrum, I thought Badlands was serviceable, that Days of Heaven went for Old Testament and settled for coffee-table book, and that The Thin Red Line was feebly improvised on set by someone who didn't seem to have the character, style, depth or experience to shoot good footage on the fly and so constantly resorted to uninspiring nature shots to cover up for the fact that the actors had no clue what they were doing ( although I did appreciate the magic trick of making Adrien Brody disappear. ) So as you can see, I wasn't exactly about to hoist Malick up to the Rivette-Kubrick-Cassavetes level.As it turns out, there are more cutaway nature shots than in Days of Heaven and Thin Red Line combined, Malick is still riding his Paradise Lost hobbyhorse, the classical music samples are as cheesily tasteful as ever, and all around, this is just like his other movies, or the difference is so small as to be infinitesimal -- AND it stars Colin ""Will Arch His Eyebrows For Food"" Farrell, maybe the only actor on earth more annoying and vain than Adrien Brody, a man who seems to destroy historical epics the way the locusts in Days of Heaven destroyed Malick's exasperating wheat.... Yet despite this morass of handicaps no movie should be able to recover from, The New World left me in a state of absolute rapture ( like so many other movies in this fiscally but not artistically cursed year, including the Brody-starring King Kong. ) Why? I can't quite figure it out. Malick's brand of National Geographic tone poem should be more pallid and generic than ever considering so many amazing latter-day examples of cinematic impressionism like Hou Hsiao-Hsien's Flowers of Shanghai, Michael Winterbottom's Code 46, Arnaud Desplechin's Esther Kahn, Xu Wei's Purple Butterfly or Claire Denis's Beau Travail -- the last of which this film actually resembles quite a bit in the way it refuses to privilege, in fact glosses over, the usual dramatic highlights.But there are subtle changes to the formula, the kind of tweaks performed by a skilled mechanic on a recalcitrant Jaguar to make it good as new. The detested voiceovers, for example, mostly stay far from the cornpone ""My heart was heavy like a thundercloud"" Carson McCullersisms that Malick usually favors, and that his amanuensis David Gordon Green has, over a regrettable series of films, rendered unuseable for at least the next two hundred years. Here they are fragmentary, shadows of thoughts more than coherent statements, and instead of stopping the action dead they're superimposed over the dialogue, which they interrupt, contradict, obscure and deepen. Fascinating stuff. For instance, there's a motif of Pocahontas saying ""Mother"" in voice-over whenever she's in a prayerful mood, and this happens not only when she's staring out at the ( mother ) ocean but also when she's nibbling on Colin Farrell's ear. For her, everything is illuminated. Colin Farrell's voiceovers, in contrast, are self-doubting and waffling, to show how the shock of his experience with Pocahontas has betrayed his linear macho ambition. Malick is thinking symphonically to place us in the heads and hearts of personages long dead; he is using words paradoxically against themselves to destroy the equivocal and deceptive power that they have to betray the soul.Malick, like Michael Haneke with Cache, also seems to be advancing beyond that goofy liberal habit of ""implicating the audience."" Those who say that this movie is about nature's superiority to civilization -- and in their favor, there is a voice-over monologue by Colin Farrell as he rows upstream towards a native encampment that is very pagan-communist, ""Any man who labors honestly will be free from the stranglehold of landlords,"" etc. -- may not have noticed that, later on, Pocahontas is sold out by her own people for a copper pot, or that Malick is anything but condescending towards her first exposure to Catholicism, that it in fact frames her experience and brings meaning to her private suffering in a way that epileptic tribal dances can't.",,Anonymous,History
A Post-Modern Alternative,"A contemplative cinema experience that is more like a visual poem. Softly spoken words and a soft, naturally lit landscape of beautiful images and whispering tones. This movie is not for everyone. In the hyper-kinetic modern movie world of extreme editing, shaky cameras, and bombastic action this one is an antithesis.This is a mood piece, of the earliest of Americana, at least from the perspective of the new invaders to the New World. The Naturals have been here for a while and it shows. As does the lack of humility and humanity for most of the guest Imperialists.The movie has enough authenticity shown through some attractive and painful experiences to keep ones attention from wandering into the fields of grass, but impatient viewers and attention span deficits may want to avoid this experiment in what one could call a post-modern alternative to the status-quo state of Hollywood.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Malick brings his own ingenuity to a story we all know but it cannot save the film from being what it is.,"A lot can be said for The New World, Terrence Malick's take on the true story of British settlers at Jamestown and the consequential love between two people of warring sides, those people being John Smith and Pocahontas. I think the story works or at least people take to it because it reminds us of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, itself a fable about two people interacting under the radar of two opposing sides. Granted, the British settlers and the Native Americans are not obviously hostile from the beginning but by the time the fight scenes have arrived, it's enough of a wait for the two to have spent time with one another and fallen in love. In this sense The New World works because Smith is allowed to spend time within the boundaries of the 'enemy', something both Romeo and Juliet could never do with the Montagues and the Capulets hating each other from the off.I think the trouble with The New World as an overall film is the clash of priorities it most definitely has. The film is artistic and creative in its shot choice and more often than not puts you in a status of dreamlike consciousness; it does this through its frequent use of cutaways to foliage and other such natural pieces of iconography like rivers, flowing water and trees swaying in the breeze; all of these shots are usually accompanied with dizzying music and rendered quite obvious in the film's demand for an artistic labelling.But this is half of the clash. The New World is essentially a genre picture, with the romance of Smith (Farrell) and Pocahontas (Kilcher) placing the film into that specific type. Later on, Pocahontas will strike up a relationship of some description with another John, this time it's Rolfe, played by Christian Bale. Bale's casting, by the time the film was made, meant the film was almost guaranteed to appeal to the teenage girl audience. Indeed, Farrell's inclusion ensured they would keep watching up to the first half and Bale's inclusion meant they'd keep going. Although the fact of the matter is that these two roles could well have been played by mostly any body since they demand the actor stand around, act neutral for most of the time and deliver whatever short bursts of dialogue when required.People say of Terrance Malick that he fits the auteur labelling; The New World is good ammunition for that argument. Most of us are familiar with the tale of the British settlers landing in America and encountering the Native Americans thanks largely through Disney's 1995 animated effort, itself rather underrated I thought, and it's because of this film I am familiar with said fable. But Malick takes this old, old story that has an essence of Romeo and Juliet within it and stamps it with his own creative, artistic touch. The cutaways to the rural backdrops of trees and water are included but they feel as if they are better things lurking below the surface, every so often having a peek over top, trying to get out. The good use of the jungle locations may remind us of Aguirre: The Wrath of God and the sparse use of dialogue feels at home given the approach to the material.So although there isn't anything wrong with the direction, The New World feels like the wrong film from the right director. It's really just a take on an event the mainstream will probably have heard of from a man the mainstream probably won't have heard of. The inclusion of Farrell, Bale and a good cast in general will attract those cast hungry people; predominantly teenagers and the artistic approach the film carries will make them go away thinking they've just seen something really smart. I didn't take to it as much as I thought I would. The fact John Smith is played by an Irishman is a little distracting, following on from the casting of Australian born Mel Gibson who came complete with an American accent of course, who played Smith in Disney's 1995 version. It seems the Americans, bless them, cannot bring themselves to cast an Englishman or indeed a Brit. for the role of John Smith.Then there are the other things like having Q'orianka Kilcher dressed up really fancy-like for the role of Pocahontas. As a character, she seems to be the only Native American female between the ages of 16-25 located on the entire continent. The fact that when she swaggers around she looks like a budding lap dancer, exchanging glances with Farrell in a dialogue sparse film remember, is distracting enough but the modern makeup and eerie sense she is supposed to be the object of the audience's gaze just feels out of place and somewhat disturbing. Pocahontas is young, attractive and doesn't say an awful lot thanks largely to the language barrier that exists between her and Smith. It's this level of anonymity that exists within her character on screen that will garner most attention from the teenage female audience as they associate themselves with her and watch (themselves) fall in love with Farrell all over again. I watch most films for their direction and the approach Malick brings to this fable is enough to warrant The New World a watch but all the other stuff going on between characters is slow and weak when it isn't plain uninteresting in the first place, how frustrating.",6.0,Anonymous,History
The piece of a true artist,"I remember the vivid discussion that took place back in 1998, when Spielberg came out with the shocking ""Saving Private Ryan"" and Malick showed up again on the film-making surface after an odd 20 years by making ""The Thin Red Line"". What you have to understand is that, exclaiming the heated conversations eight years ago, there is a fundamental difference in the philosophy of making movies for the two.Whereas Spielberg is all about excitement and action, Malick is filmed poetry. Dialogue is limited to a certain extent. All that counts is the visual impression and the feelings it leaves you with. Malick is a director who makes you think, he virtually forces you to it. The way he portrays nature and its relationship towards us humans (and vice versa) is unbelievably stunning. The theatre was all quiet as if a hidden force had taken all their breath away. Awesome.Just like the way the old painting masters stunned the artistic world with their craft hundreds of years ago, Malick steers the art of movie-making in his very own direction.One can only admire his will to release films that go against the commercial stream of Hollywood. It is indeed fascinating that there are still moviegoers out there that appreciate quality and don't mind sitting in the theatre for 2 1/2 hours. I usually am under the impression that we're too much conditioned to the 100 minutes-movie nowadays and that effects and flat dialogue are destroying the art completely. We're sold for dumb. Luckily enough, the theatre I was in was almost sold out, but the average age as well as the intellectual standard was probably slightly higher than among the masses who went to see the sequel to ""Underworld"" the same evening.As for ""The New World"", Malick continues where he left us with James Caviezel's character in ""The Thin Red Line"". The connection is undoubtedly there. Colin Farrell, for once in a very quiet role, plays the troubled observer, the twisted conqueror of a new, unknown world and soon finds himself torn between the demands of his previous life and the chances of creating a new one and starting from scratch on the American continent. Yes, I'm usually not the biggest Farrell fan, but it's all in his sad eyes and tormented facial expressions. I think his talent just got wasted in the past years and I congratulate him for being able to break out of his stereotypical and flat tough guy image.Q'Orianka Kilcher is just plain astonishing. You could never tell that she was only 15 when the movie was shot. Her innocence and easiness is beautifully captured on screen and she fits the part perfectly. But the same goes for the entire cast, very good choice overall.I can't tell whether the historical background is depicted precisely enough. 400 years have passed and its certainly impossible to get it all straight. Therefore, I won't get into the discussion about the Native's looks or the English slur of that time. What I liked, however, is the last fourth of the movie and the juxtaposition of the New World vs. the Old World. What a weird scene that must've been, having Natives running around in English gardens. Priceless.Hopefully, Malick will let us see more of the story with a longer Director's cut or some bonus features on DVD (which I'll certainly buy). There were a couple of bits in the movie, especially towards the end, where time jumped way too fast and you really had to be attentive enough to grasp the story. And sometimes during the middle part, where Farrell and Kilcher are coming closer, there are a few repetitious scenes of them two out in the fields which could've been cut.Of course, this is not a perfect movie, but it comes very close to it. Maybe in a couple of decades, people will talk about it like they used to talk about a Van Gogh in an art gallery and say, ""See, that's a true Malick. Isn't it beautiful?"". He always lets you wait, but it's absolutely worth it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Otherworldly,"A new world indeed and a new Terence Malick picture (at least his most recent complete one). It is a very spiritual movie and it is moving at a really slow pace. Even a turtle and/or a snail would be offended by the pacing. Seriously though, you have to let yourself relax and breathe ... like the movie does.The newcomer Q'orianka who plays the main role here is great! She came to Berlin with the rest of the cast, to celebrate the movie at the Berline International Film Festival ... while she also had her birthday (she got 16 in 2006) and you never would've guessed it ... Women always seem more mature ... in fact they are ;o)Anyway her performance elevates the movie, although it is awfully difficult to feel empathy for any other character portrayed in the movie (it's obvious that it's the intention of Malick to give them flaws), that's why I didn't like this movie as much as I have previous Malick films (not that there are many mind you! ;o)If you can cope with the pace and the more than human characters, than you should watch this drama ...",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Native American Tribe and the Europeans come together in this story and show the epic history of the first colonial settlement.,"I had the special privilege of viewing this movie at its Premiere in The United Nations. I also had the honor of meeting the actress who played Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher)and one of the Native American Warriors (Brian F. O'Byrne) after the film was shown. They answered a few of the audiences questions and were very nice.The film itself was enjoyable, especially to those who love a good plot. There are some nice battle scenes that were brilliantly choreographed. Ms. Kilcher's performance was outstanding and for her first film seemed to make it all the more impressive.The New World focuses on Pocohantas' life and the creation of the first colony erected in the early 1600's and how Pocohantas' aided the Europeans. The film also includes the romance between John Smith (Colin Farrel) and John Rolfe (Christian Bale)which really helps to adapt the movie and her performance.I have never seen the Disney movie of Pocohantas but I could easily imagine this movie having a much more in-depth plot and is a very must see. There is no gore at all in the movie and Pocohantas' romance is also kept very clean which makes the film viewable by all audiences.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Typical Academy Tripe,"I give this a four because it was pretty to look at. Other than that, it was complete garbage. I almost hate to say that as I enjoyed the acting, the pacing, and the photography. In fact, I was really looking forward to this film.Upon watching it (the day it came out in theaters), I found it to be completely historically inaccurate. As a descendant of John Rolfe and Pocahontas, I have always hated the romance myth concerning John Smith. This simply never happened. In reality she was only about 11.The worst is that there is a truly beautiful love story between Rolfe and Pocahontas that was never really explored. I counted on Malick to have enough respect for his subject(s) to portray it truthfully, instead of making a hackneyed attempt at rewriting history. He let me down. If a filmmaker can't respect his subject, then I can't respect his work. I will never watch this film again.If you want the truth, read a book. Try starting with ""Love and Hate in Jamestown"" by David A. Price, or ""The Jamestown Adventure: Accounts of the Virginia Colony, 1605-1614 (Real Voices, Real History)"" by Ed Southern. Avoid this dreck like an Indian raid. Or a worthless hack.",1.0,Anonymous,History
slow dreamy beauty,"It's 1607. John Smith (Colin Farrell) arrives in the new world in chains. Captain Christopher Newport establishes the Jamestown, Virginia settlement. He pardons John Smith and puts him in charge of an expedition. With rising tension, John is taken prisoner by the natives. Pocahontas is the favorite of Chief Powhatan. She saves John's life and he becomes a part of the community. He is released back to the settlement to find starvation and death stalking the remaining settlers. They are saved by Pocahontas. Powhatan banishes her and orders an attack when the English won't leave.Terrence Malick has mastered the slow dreamy beautiful visual style. He makes the native world an idyllic paradise. The English world is the one with a foreboding menace. The dreamy mood works well for the native civilization. The action also works well with surprisingly scary quick native warriors. The English world feels disjointed. The story is told in snippets. Malick is much more interested in the dreamlike mood. It doesn't have the intensity and urgency of the story which leads me to wonder if a fictional story would be better. In that way, accuracy and specificity would not matter quite as much. Pocahontas in the English world is not as compelling as John Smith in the native world. Q'orianka Kilcher is an intriguing new actress. She's able to maintain interest throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful sweeping movie,"Like watching a poem, it's poetic, artful and as stunning as a moving painting. Terrance Malick's films are an acquired taste. There is very little dialogue but the film doesn't need it, it's story is told through expressions, music and cinematography. Each word is meant to be meaningful and not wasted.The settings are authentic and real, you feel as if you are transported to the 17th century. It makes you appreciate the trials the early settlers had to go through. The New World is not my favorite movie of all time, but I have an appreciation for the way Malick brings this movie to life.

Extraordinary picture!!,"Quite possibly, the most beautiful film I've ever seen. Certainly, there's never been anything like it. I would suggest familiarizing oneself with the story of Jamestown, Capt. John Smith, and Pocahontas to appreciate the film all the more. Terrence Malick (Harvard Rhodes Scholar, Professor of Philosophy at MIT, etc.) naturally assumes the story is already well known. Anyone who might have missed that day in school will probably miss a lot in the movie and assume it's somehow incomplete in it's exposition. Assuming the audience already knows the true story allows the director to go in a different direction with the film. An incredible experience!

Some of the worst story-telling in history.,"Movies like this are one reason why I object to one man both writing AND directing a movie. There's insufficient cross-checking of ideas and story-telling clarity and what you wind up with is often the product of one man's idiosyncrasies and shortcomings.Such is the case with Terrence Malick's ""The New World."" There are so many holes in this screenplay and it's such lousy story-telling that I quit watching halfway through even though I was extremely interested in the history. I'm not sure whether I was more infuriated at the poor story-telling wasting my time or I was put off by the cinematic technique of divorcing audio from video, which is nothing more than Malick's cinematic attempt at waxing poetic, or I was more irked by having my intelligence insulted by the whole thing.There are so many holes in the screenplay I don't know where to begin. The viewer is constantly saying, ""What happened to this character or that character; what season is it, what's happening with this or that subplot,"" and on and on and on. There are jumps in time, there are missing establishing shots, etc. There are totally unrelated shots interspersed in the flow of semi-related scenes that make me wonder whether Malick and the editors are schizophrenic.And I'll tell you this . . . if I were hired to edit this movie, I would have walked out after seeing what footage I had available for use. I would not want my name associated with this movie in any way, shape or form. The editors should hang their heads in shame.And can we talk about the dialog????? It was so grossly insufficient for plot flow it was ridiculous. During fully 50% of the scenes I was thinking, ""SAY something. SAY what you're thinking. ADVANCE the plot you mute moron!"" There's so much plot left on the table from the lack of meaningful dialog that it's just criminal. Malick should prohibited BY LAW from ever writing or publishing another screenplay -- it's that bad.I'm not even a film school grad and I know that cinematic techniques should never draw attention to themselves. The viewer should never be so conspicuously aware of any cinematic techniques that he feels manipulated by the director. Well, that's all one feels when watching this endless parade of disjointed scenes and manipulative schemes. One gets the feeling that director Malick is sitting next to you and staring at you saying, ""Watch what happens next. See this cinematic trick? See that stunt? What do you think of THIS? And TAKE THAT! Now here's more of THIS!"" (I got a similar feeling (but not as bad) during ""Armageddon"" because of the excessive and tiring slow-mo that the director over-used.) What people have been saying about special effects for 30 years is also true of artsy techniques: they can be nice, but they are NEVER a substitute for plot, dialogue and coherent, compelling story-telling.This movie was absolutely insulting to watch. To TRY to watch. I'd like to sit down and watch this movie with Malick so that I could stop it whenever I wanted and explain to him exactly what doesn't work and why. The only problem with that is I'd have to endure watching the rest of it.Malick's sentence for inflicting this abusive disaster on the public should be one year of incarceration with nothing to eat but bread and water and nothing to do but watch great (and coherent) movies, like ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" and ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" and ""The Verdict"" and ""Dead Poet's Society"" and ""One Hour Photo"" everyday, all day.The actors and crew and music man James Horner are hereby exonerated and found blameless.

"The intensity is there, but the focus isn't","At first glance, one could say Terrence Malick, one of the most respected directors in Hollywood, is now trading his personal take on movies and taking a shot at one of the most famous American stories. Well - when one hears the plot to The New World, the latest film by Malick, we can clearly see he chose to focus on the myth of John Smith and Pocahontas rather than the actual story. But, even though this story has been told before, it is told through the eyes of an incredible man.The history and trivia following The New World, I must admit, is better than the film itself. The story for the film was written in the early seventies, but due to financial setbacks it wasn't until 2005 would it see the light of day. This is Terrence Malick's fourth film in over thirty years, cementing the fact that he takes time and effort to perfect his stories.He tells the story of Captain John Smith, played by Collin Farrell, an English explorer who makes the famed ""Jamestown Expedition"" with his crew and stumbles upon a village in Virginia in 1607. Smith, Captain Christopher Newport (Plummer), and the other crew-mates are met with a Native American tribe. Though she is never referred to by name, Pocahontas (Kilcher), is the main character from the tribe and the film begins to tell the fictionalized romance between Smith and Pocahontas, while including the incredible fear of being around an unsettling group of people from both points of view.While this story is going on, we get amazing shots of grass, water, rivers, birds, the sun, the skyline, and the wildlife depicted in such an exquisite nature it is almost breathtaking. The highest point of the film is the beautiful, enriching cinematography. Malick is known for bringing the setting and the beauty of the land to the foreground of the picture rather than leaving it as many film-makers do; a scenic backdrop only occasionally brought into full focus. The enticing images make up for a film that lacks in greater fields.Because this is Malick, the story is non-linear and very jumpy. This worked for his latest picture, The Tree of Life, because it was a simpler story and one from his own mind. With The New World, the story of Jamestown is a little harder to follow for many people, and it doesn't help matters that the film can hardly stay focused on its characters. The story is still told with clarity, but because of the quiet dialog (which sometimes can literally be incomprehensible), the sluggish pace, and the awkward narrations, it feels like the film is making itself harder to watch and harder to focus on.Sometimes, I'd be lost for several minutes staring aimlessly into the backdrop of the scenery. Since it's the prime focus of the film, I don't think Malick would be ashamed to hear that. But the lack of clarity in the story, and the constant drifts from scenery to storyline do make the film a chore to follow at some points. Not to mention, the film runs already lengthy at a one-hundred and thirty five minute runtime. Because of the story and the artsy feel, it feels every bit as long as that and sometimes longer. The original cut is nearing three hours which I honestly can't believe. I had a hard time sitting still the final half-hour of the shorter cut.The acting is one of the strongest points in the film, however. Collin Farrell's role as Captain Smith feels not acted but every-bit as natural as it was meant to be. Christopher Plummer, whose narrations in My Dog Tulip were fantastic, gives a great performance here as well. And you can't leave out the extraordinary work of Q'orianka Kilcher as the teenage Pocahontas.Because of the time of release, the story itself, and the eclectic man at the camera, New Line Cinema will clearly be struggling to make their money back from The New World. While I'm still getting used to Malick, and the fact that stories from past the 1800's don't quite pull me in so fast, I can't be considered the normal reaction for a film like this. I recommend this to strict Malick fans, but also see fans of history and the Jamestown Expedition enjoying the film quite a bit too. For me - this was a fairly lengthy journey, but it wasn't a lost cause.Starring: Collin Farrell, Q'orianka Kilcher, Christopher Plummer, and Christian Bale.

"Gitchee, but not Gumee","There is a lot of good and bad to be said about this 20th century reality view of 'the Indian Princess', Pocahontas. First off, it seems to be another in a long line of 'east meets west' culture clash movies. (In this case, the Europeans are the 'east') The cinematography itself is beautiful, and the style manor and detail of costume and set will give you a 'glimpse' of the people of the time of King James.There are some notable performances too, not award winning, but notable. ""Q"" Kilcher is, indeed gorgeous, and gives a fine portrait of 'prancing' Pocahantas. It is to her misfortune, however, that director Malick might of been a little too focused on her, and the end result is that it looks like a three hour screen test of Kilcher.Colin Farrell proves he has talent indeed! Throughout the entire film, he wears an unflinching expression of a man who has forgotten something important, and just can't remember what it is.Wes Studi adds another native American performance to a long list in his Hollywood career. Mr. Studi should be given an award for his portrayal of Native Americans throughout the years, because no one person has done more than Mr. Studi to dispel the 'typical' Hollywood 'cowboy and Indian' portrayal of Native Americans. Even when he has played the 'heavy', the portrait is strong and dignified.Overall, it's pleasing entertainment, that could have been a 'lot shorter', and will entertain the history buff, but seems to be headed for the shelf in the wake of more exciting summer entertainment",6.0,Anonymous,History

Malick wrote the script back in the 70's and finally puts it on film here in 2005(6).Pocahontas is played by newcomer Q'orianka Kilcher, in a wonderful turn as Pochahontas. Colin Farrell, plays John Smith, doing probably his strong work. And of no big surprise, Christian Bale also does some of his best work here playing the future husband of Pocahontas (or Rebbecca as the English rename her). None of the actors here really have a lot of dialog to work with, so Malick has them express and convey their emotions through body language. It works to magnificently. Some people clearly were bored with the movie due to this reason, but this isn't your average film. It reaches out and wants to make you feel like you are really there. And the fact that there is little dialog, outside of Malick's trademark voice overs, makes this possible. You don't have overly talky situations in real life, and often the most meaningful gestures are expressed without words. Nothing is said here for the purpose of filler.Just like every other Malick film, 'The New World' is chalk full of symbolism. Just as every word spoken on screen is full of meaning, every image Malick inserts in his film means something. Most movies take the easy way out and explain these things for you in the end. Not Malick. He relies on his imagery to tell his hidden philosophical points. Emmanuel Lubezki takes the reins on the camera and does a beautiful job. With each film Malick has used a different cinematographer, but his visual style is always evident. Crew members have often spoke of Malick's almost preternatural understanding of cinematography. The look of his films are his own. He establishes dogmas of cinematography: for The New World, only steadicam or hand-held shots were to be used, and the cameraman was encouraged to move on his own to find the rhythm of the shot, among other things.This movie is not for everyone. Malick's movies, all four of them, move very slowly. But they do so with all deliberate speed. Malick has a way of lulling you into almost a hypnosis with his flowing camera movements and editing style. It makes you feel closer to the real story, and it does make his movies feel longer than they actually are, in that rarely positive way. They draw you in so that you are there, in that world. If you have it in you to allow yourself to be taken in, the payoff to be found is deeply rewarding.The plot to 'The New World' is easy enough. Everyone will get the basic pattern here. Understanding the big picture, however, is a whole other story. Malick, more-so than many other directors, has a way of getting under your feet and over your head. This is very frustrating for many people who are expecting a classic narrative style.For those with the willingness to allow Malick to take you in and let the film run over you, then 'The New World' will be unforgettable.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Look at the scenery, because that's all there is!","This is probably the most boring movie I have ever seen since A Space Odyssey. I almost fell asleep during the film. The story wasn't carried by the actors; it was shown by pretty images of water and landscapes. I felt like I was looking at a screen full of pretty pictures of nature with the stereo turned up. I do have to admit that many of the shots of nature and the work of cinematography were quite amazing, but that doesn't make a film.A film requires film-making talent, acting, and plot. There is no plot or acting. Yes, there are some famous actors in it like Colin Farrel, Christian Bale, and Christopher Plummer, but they were lucky to say a hundred words. Whenever they got a moment to talk, there voices would trail off and the music would overflow the dialog, making it nearly impossible to hear what they're saying.By the time the movie actually develops story, which is pretty much the love relationship between Pocahontas and John Rolfe, I was already in apathy. The one battle sequence, which is maybe ten minutes long didn't even get me interested. In fact, I found it rather dull compared to the intense action in that Terrence Malick marvelously directed in his The Thin Red Line.This was an art film, fully focused on the scenery and the director of photography's talent. I don't like bashing movies unless it is really horrible. Some people I know like this movie, others don't. I certainly do not like it, but it isn't the worst thing I have seen. because of the cinematography and images, I give it a generous 3/10.-Look at the scenery, because that's all there is!",3.0,Anonymous,History
I want to see the LONG version,"I actually haven't seen the film yet, but have been anxiously waiting to see it for 6 months as its release got pushed. Unfortunately it made its original New York run while I was out of town for the holidays and was GONE much to my dismay the day I got back. I am very upset that I have to wait for the DVD to see the LONG version. I happen to like films with well developed expositions, even if the current fast food culture has no patience for them. I wish there was a choice...maybe one long version showing at specific theaters for those who want that option. Do you hear me out there producer/distributors...some of us want the whole portion! not the short shrift.",,Anonymous,History

Christian bale was classic as usuall. By the way, this is my first review ever, so i might be a bit off on some points.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Malicks shame.,"Now, just to get one thing totally clear before you read the rest. I love Terrence Malick, he's one of my favorite directors who sadly only have made 4 films. OK, perhaps I had high expectations to it seeing how both The Thin Red Line and Badlands are in my top 50 but this film where just a major mistake. My main problem with it where partly, ""It where boring"", and coming from me most average movie goers probably died. I prefer it to move slow, I even prefer anti-climaxes over climaxes, but I was almost bored to tears with this one. I where so surprised that Malick where unable to create beauty or excitement into this. The frames where basically dead and the cinematography what you would expect from your average nobody for not to mention the poor editing. Now this is mostly not Malicks fault but he should at least have worked with talented people. The acting where very wooden to and Jesus Christ that screenplay lacked any sense of true dept. I'm sad to say this fellow Malick fans but I think the man failed delivering what he could have made and although it wasn't much to start with he could have made it into a great film, sadly he didn't. I'm looking forward to his next film though, seeing how soon after this it actually comes I hope its a sign on that he knows what crappy job he did and that he's now trying to make it OK again. I just have to say this: The New World bored me and I'm the guy who's at the end of his seat watching Stalker and 2001, two movies generally bashed for being slow. This film where lacking all qualities of Malicks previous work and I'm extremely sad to say I can't go higher that a 6/10, and thats being extremely nice.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Being high on peyote must give a similar feeling,"I made the incredible mistake of thinking this movie would be like '' Tristan & Isolde. That it'd be the kind of epic war tale that Hollywoodstudios tend to make once in a while; action-packed romance while being light-hearted and funny at the same time. It wasn't...Completely ignorant of the complexity of this movie I watched it with a group of friends. None of them highly educated on ''the better movie'', probably not knowing that Fellini isn't an Italian sports car, thinking that a good movie has to be full of action, tits and gore and that drama is for women or gay people. So, to summarize my thoughts, the usual mainstream crowd. They thought that this movie sucked, and I can't blame them. So to be honest, maybe my judgment is colored by their negative response during the movie.I myself am very fond of the first ten minutes of '' Once upon a time in the west ''. Building up the tension by just showing some strong visual imagery, like the turning wheel of the windmill, a fly bothering a man and people waiting for things to come. '' The new world '' is like this; rather than having dialog or action in it, it tries to tell a story by showing images of nature and people staring to each other. But unlike '' Once upon...'' this isn't just a phase of the movie, this is everything, this is THE movie. It makes this picture very inaccessible and boring. It also doesn't help that the few lines of dialog in it are just some random thoughts about love, like: Pocahontas: He is like a tree. He shelters me. I lie in his shade, or, Pocahontas: Mother, why can I not feel as I should... must? Once false, I must not be again. Take out the thorn.It's like all the main characters are high on peyote and in their highness try to say something worthy about life and love. It felt like complete randomness to me.Okay, so far all of the bad things about this movie, I must also say that at times I felt like it was film-making in its purest form. I really adored the scenes in which John Smith learned English to Pocahontas, or, when Pocahontas is seeing the cold and dirty England for the first time in her life. These sporadic moments levitate the movie to a higher level, but they don't make up for the boring feeling the movie as a whole gives.",6.0,Anonymous,History
No match for The Thin Red Line,"Once I heard that Terry is making this movie I was jumping around. That's because The Thin Red Line is one of my all time favorite movies. One just can see how Malick evolves from Badlands to Days of Heaven to The Thin Red Line. Unfortunately I must say that The New World was not what I expected. Its not because of the actors - to my opinion one needs to respect the directors choice for the role, because just he knows how the movie will feel like. Probably, if I had not seen the Thin Red Line, I would of liked The New World. Here also you get the dreamy atmosphere, the lead role voice over and, of course, the beautiful photography. But somehow this movie just doesn't go so far as did The Thin Red Line. Maybe the emotions weren't so strong, maybe the war was the advantage for the Red Line. Maybe. But still, this movie is better than most of the pictures you see in cinemas. Watch it and tell me, maybe I am wrong.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Simply excellent.,"I'll admit that I am a lurker here on the boards and in commenting; I read other peoples' posts without ever adding in my own comments. However, after seeing ""The New World"" last night, I am compelled to share my thoughts on the film.I went into the theater not knowing what to expect. I knew nothing about Terrence Malick's work and so came in with no preconceived ideas about what his work would be like. I will admit that Colin Farrell is not my favorite actor and I was slightly suspect of what his acting might be like.I am not a professional film critic, and so will not analyze the film at such a level; there are plenty of people on this board who have already done so, and well. I will simply say that I left the theater stunned. The cinematography was beautiful, Q'Orianka Kilcher was astounding, Colin Farrell was great.It's true, the film is slow, but those who are willing to sit patiently and let the movie come to them instead of seeking out their own expectations, will be richly rewarded",9.0,Anonymous,History

Drink at least four cups of coffee before watching this snoozer,"Many other ""I hate it"" reviewers have already hit the nail on the head: This movie has beautiful scenery, lots of birds, insect sounds, meaningless and annoying narration, and so on.But I have to disagree on a one point. One reviewer praised it for being historically accurate. It is not. There is no real historical evidence that Pocahontas (her real name was ""Matoaka"") and John Smith were anything more than friends. Oopsie! The entire basis for the movie is garbage.I could go on, but this movie has already eaten more than two hours of my life, and I need to put a stop to it.",,Anonymous,History
Musical Take on 'First Year in Jamestown',"Can the story of Captain Smith, Pocahontas, et.al. be presented in the fashion of ""Last Year in Marienbad""? Terrence Malick (of ""Days of Heaven,"" yup) seems to channel Resnais in ""The New World"" he wrote and directed.It's a bizarre, puzzling, beautiful, and maddening film, sure to end up on both the year's best and worst lists. And, one of the strangest things about this strange movie is its soundtrack.After James Horner's name appears on the screen as the composer, there follows 2 1/2 hours (doesn't anyone make 90-minute movies anymore?) of Mozart and Wagner.Now, Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 floating over the muck of the settlement and the broad vistas of the Naturals (as Christopher Plummer refers to the Indians) may be anachronistic, but we are well used to KV 488 from a dozen movies, including - alas - ""Way of the Gun,"" ""Good Riddance,"" and ""Misunderstood.""No, what's interesting about the soundtrack of ""The New World"" is how the Prelude to ""Das Rheingold"" is used - at length and significantly. Just as the film itself is good/bad, there is a contrast here in the appropriateness of the soundtrack. Wagner's unstoppable ascending modulation makes no sense at all in the middle of the movie, but the very beginning is something else.As the settlers' ships approach the coast of this new and strange world, water is everywhere... and there swells that grand ""Creation music"" so well, so right. Underwater glimpses of young native women swimming just reinforce the connection, needlessly.Studio notes, by the way, identify soundtrack portions not written by Horner as ""non-original music."" That be Mozart and Wagner...:)Janos",7.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful tale of two cultures meeting,"The place is Virginia, the year is 1607.Three ships of the Jamestown Expedition,led by Captain Newport,arrive and the Native Americans are witnessing this.When two cultures meet it means bloody battles.The English men build a fort there.John Smith leaves the fort to explore another area and trade with the Indians, but he gets captured.But it is princess Pocahontas that saves John Smith's life.Captain Smith and Pocahontas find romance with each other.Once he is released he becomes the leader in the fort.People live in terrible conditions there, they don't have much to eat, there are diseases, people are dying...The whole situation seems pretty hopeless.And there is another battle to be expected with the Indians, who see that the English will not leave their country.Also Smith loses the trust of their men, when he disagrees with them trading Pocahontas and lodging her in the fort to protect their families.Then Captain Newport returns from England and informs Smith that the king has offered him the opportunity to lead a new expedition of his own to find a new passage to the West Indies.Smith returns to England instead and asks his friend to tell Pocahontas that he has died in the crossing.All the beauty of Pocahontas' life is now gone.Then John Rolfe, a tobacco planter arrives and wants Pocahontas.He marries her, after she's baptised, but she still has a place in her heart that belongs to John Smith.Terrence Malick is the writer and director of The New World (2005).This is a very poetic movie.Malick has portrayed beautifully the story of these people.Especially those moments between Smith and Pocahontas, but you can find some beauty in the battle scenes, also.And he has done an excellent job capturing the era on screen.There's nothing to remind of our times there.It's almost like watching a documentary on how these people lived.There are some outstanding performances in the movie.Colin Farrell does a role of the lifetime as John Smith.Q'orianka Kilcher is very sensuous in her part as Pocahontas.I think we'll be hearing from her in the future.Christopher Plummer gives another fine performance as Captain Newport.Christopher Bale is great as John Rolfe.Wes Studi does a good job playing Openhancanough.Ben Chaplin plays Robinson and John Savage is Savage.The love story portrayed in this movie is beautiful.Watch this piece of art and step back to the 17th century.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"One of the best  Malick films, on a par with Badlands.","Malick at his best, avoids excesses and turns out a brilliant film. This genre, new world discovery, was made for his style. His visual development of the storyline is exhilarating. 15-year old steals movie. Malick holds both Ferrel and Plummer back. Action, drama, love story are all terrific. He puts you in the wilderness. I loved it most for the constantly innovative techniques and perspectives. England in the 17th century seems very authentic. Malick handles the sweeping themes of culture clashes and interracial love magnificently well. You'll feel like invading a foreign country when your done. He dignifies native Americans without getting preachy or sappy. How will IMDb know when I've written enough for submission. Do they have psychic powers. Or it that I haven't put in 10 periods yet.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Strolling Through Nuance Rather Than In-Your-Face Action,"The New World has many detractors. Most comment on the slow pace of the film, and this is undeniably so. ""It's like watching grass grow"" is the commonly heard clichÃ©. I'm not here to defend the speed at which this story unfolds; it IS slow. But it's also beautifully put together.Try this: You're in a raft on a placidly flowing river. Trees wash by, animals nibble grasses on the shores, the sky illuminates a beautiful blue above and below while the sun warms your legs. The rapids are few and easily navigated, allowing you time to view everything around you. Sound boring? Or comfortable? If this sounds like death, stay away from The New World. If it sounds pleasant and enjoyable, give the film a try.What I enjoyed was the how the story dribbled into the viewer's lap. It roiled around you like a cool mountain stream and allowed time for everything to come into focus. This isn't Disney's Pocahontas; this is how the Jamestown Settlement came to be, in all its boringness and beauty.Colin Farrell stars as Captain John Smith, one of the founders of the original colonies. He and his shipmates arrive in the Americas and are soon building a fort while the leader of the group, Captain Christopher Newport (Christopher Plummer), heads back to Europe to resupply and bring more colonists.Meanwhile, Jamestown is nearly overrun by disease, power struggles, and the native Indians. Amidst all this, Captain Smith meets up with Pocahontas, the pretty and inquisitive daughter of a local chieftain. It is her generosity that allows these first colonists to survive, and it is mainly because of her love for Smith.After Captain Smith leaves the colony in search of better lands up north, it is wrongly reported to Pocahontas that her love perished in a shipping accident. Thus she despairs and eventually falls for John Rolfe (Christian Bale), a tobacco farmer.Pocahontas is later requested by the King and Queen of England to come to Court and meet them Â…and she does. Thus, we have TWO new worlds being discovered: one for the Europeans (America), and one for the Native Americans (England and Europe).Pocahontas later learns that Captain Smith is still alive. It is a bitter realization and she has to decide whom to stay with, Smith or Rolfe.It is the beautiful cinematography of The New World that really pulls the viewer in. Some have complained that it should have won Best Cinematography at the Oscars and not Memoirs of a Geisha. I disagree. The New World is extremely beautiful to watch, no doubt, but I feel Memoirs of a Geisha was a bit better on the eyes.The wondrous musical score was another boon for the film. Surrounding the viewer/listener in an emulsion of color and sound, the music made for some powerful moments. Terrence Malick, Director, knows how to engage an audience. But it's not going to capture all those who watch it.In a society where action sells better than art, this film will be lost to many. Don't get me wrong, I love action films just as much as anyone. But it's not a necessary ingredient for a movie such as this. The authenticity (as seen on the DVD's extra features) will astound many; I know it blew me away. The re-creation of the settlement, the Native American huts, the battle gear, etc, are all pulled from archaeological records and sources. Impressive.It's also noteworthy to mention how little dialogue there is in the film. Terrence Malick prefers to let the scenes speak for themselves rather than have actors and actresses voices spoil the moment.I guess what it boils down to is this: If you don't like art films that focus on nuance rather than specifics, stay away from The New World. But if you don't mind letting your mind meander through a burbling set of scenes, you'll probably delight in this film.",6.0,Anonymous,History
I was expecting much more,"""The thin red line"" is most certainly one of the best war movies ever : Terrence Malick has built a masterpiece by avoiding all the usual ""clichÃ©s"" you find in any war movie. Sadly, he hasn't been able to do the same here : his Indians are man children, Pocahantas spends most of her time chasing butterflies and praying, and the movie suffers from a simplistic approach of the matter. In the end, Terrence Malick does not deliver the same smart, unusual, emotional work of art as he did with ""The thin red line"". We are left with beautiful pictures and landscapes, great music and undeniable poetry (some scenes are very close to ""The thin red line""), and a powerful end (I must admit). However, I was expecting so much more from this talented man.",5.0,Anonymous,History
A fine and devastating work of art,"How does one come to want to live with the likes of modern man, modern times? Who would not only help out, but come along for the journey, even when they didn't have to? That is the question of this film. When you see a bird in the sky, without a flock, you can ask how did the bird with its flock wish to fly off on it's own.I'm always somewhat shocked after seeing a Malick film. When something is truly what people tend to call original, it has this ability to destroy your foundations. Every part of this film is fundamentally new for cinema. From the disciplined beauty of the photography, the pacing of the film's story, and just the nimbleness with which Malick creates depth and character, space and devastating emotions, will make you rethink everything about how you thought they should come about.Malick is hard to talk about. Better to just watch his films, look through the eyes of his mysterious characters, and try to wonder about the world like they all wonder, think like they all think, and care like they care.The New World is a fine and devastating work of art.",10.0,Anonymous,History
So awful it was painful to watch,"This movie was so boring it was an ordeal to get through it. The cover's claim ""The Best Historical Epic Romance Since Titanic"" is completely misleading. It makes one think this is a good movie, comparable to Titanic. It may be based on a true story, so it may be historical, but there is absolutely NOTHING romantic about it, and the word ""epic"" applied to this movie is a complete joke. It's too bad that the final product is so bad, because they certainly did spend a lot of money on the production - the set, costumes, etc. Those are okay. The cinematography is quite beautiful at times. The music is pretty annoying, but the real problem is the action, or should I say the lack of it. There is next to nothing happening for most of the movie and the little that is happening makes almost no sense, there is very little continuity. Even the little there is in terms of a plot is pretty unbelievable, like Pocahontas learning a new language fluently seemingly overnight. The actors can't be blamed for this disaster, they had very little chance to ""act"". Overall, I thought this is one of the worst movies I've ever sat through and my most sincere recommendation is for viewers to avoid it. If you are curious, rent it, but for heaven's sake don't buy it. You'll be lucky if you can sit through this movie even once.",1.0,Anonymous,History
The New World,"The New World is set in 1607 and is about the Europeans who come across a settlement with several Native Americans and the one captain named John Smith falls in love with one of the Native American girls named Pocahontas. The film shows their relationship and also the conflicts and differences between the Europeans and the Native Americans. The film also shows Pocahontas's relationship with an aristocrat named John Rolfe as well. The entire film is shown in her point of view. Winner of The NBR Award for Best Breakthrough Performance By An Actress (Q'Orianka Kilcher, who plays Pocahontas) at The National Board Of Review. The New World is a very well made film. It's direction is good a long with performances, original music, cinematography, art direction, set decoration, costumes and makeup. But unfortunately the film itself is very slow moving and it gets to the point where it almost becomes boring. The film's director Terrence Malick is known for having gorgeous looking movies and this movie does look gorgeous and is very well made by the cast and crew. The film's script and pacing needed work however. Other than being a visual treat for the mind there was little else to enjoy about the film. The characters needed to have more going on and there needed to be a little more action or conflict in the film. I don't mind films with a slower pace that have a good story to it, but there is relatively no real concrete story here. Another problem I had with the film was I had a lot of trouble understanding what the actors were saying a lot of the time and that didn't help with the film either. I will give The New World a mild recommendation for it's look and the way it was so masterfully done, but as a film meant to entertain and provoke interest this film fails on that level. I do hope however that Terrence Malick begins work on another film soon because he is a gifted director with a great eye who just needs a better script the next time around.",6.0,Anonymous,History
It's about time someone got it right,"This was an amazing movie. I'm so pleasantly surprised. I really had no expectation...or rather, very low expectations on account of Colin Farrell's ""Alexander"". I figured this would be just another historical drama that disappoints, or a wildly unrealistic romance. My main curiosity was to see how well they portrayed the Algonquin natives. They seemed very authentic in the previews. To my astonishment, this was the least of the breath-taking aspects of the movie. I agree with another reviewer that many people are not going to be able to appreciate this film. It's a shame. I'm sure many are flocking to see it with the same expectation of seeing the standard historical action/drama/romance and they'll miss the subtlety and poetic beauty of the narrative and photography. Malick used similar technique in ""Thin Red Line"" but it didn't seem to enhance that story. Perhaps because that was a ""war"" movie, I didn't think his style worked. In this case, the ethereal, otherworldliness, and metaphysical perspective fit in perfectly with the mutual discovery taking place. Despite my knowledge of this particular time in history, I felt I was given a fresh look at this event and the people who lived it. Definitely for a more mature audience, not action movie fans.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Stylish piece of work, but lacked punch and passion.","I didn't realize before watching this film that Terence Mallick had directed the Thin Red Line and The New World but it didn't take time to spot the style straight off. I like his approach generally, nature shots conveying meaning, depth and beauty, reminding us of a virgin world that is somewhat gone forever. At times however it felt a bit like a nature lesson. Although beautifully shot, the movie I felt lacked real depth of emotion and tension.I feel that the script, scene sequence and score could have got a lot more out of this film, especially given the locations chosen, it practically sold itself. For instance, in Lawrence of Arabia you have spectacular vistas but also an amazing script, great character development, the scenic shots support the project they are not the project, which was how I felt a little watching this movie.I don't think it is sufficient to rely on 'dreamy' scenes of the principal characters rolling around in the grass, almost touching, lingering looks, shots of sunsets and the wind blowing the grass. I can see what the Director is trying to achieve but I think it would be more effective to carve the relationship of the two principal characters out of a strong script, tension scenes and fraught film score, all of which focuses our attention just a bit more on the tension surrounding the characters, the clash of civilizations, the potential problems they will encounter when they connect and so on.There is no doubt that Terrence Malick is a talented individual, however, the New World felt like a string of beautiful shots that just didn't gel together effectively, a lot of jumping around from scene to scene but didn't quite convey what was taking place between the two principal characters, their love for each other set against the backdrop of one of the most important moments in human history. There was too much of Pochaontas prancing around fields, shots of high green grass blowing in the wind, and Indians to stepping out only to disappear (Thin Red Line-esquire).What was needed alongside the beauty was real punch, drama, tension, passion. I thought generally speaking the actors delivered but I found it hard to understand some of the dialogue, especially the children (Irish I believe) in the settlement, and I am Irish.In saying that the final few minutes of the New World moved me greatly. The music, the cutting of scenes, and the final moment when the music stopped, were inspiring. Incidentally, I found the conclusion of the Thin Red Line moving in a similar way. Unfortunately what preceded seemed a bit light on its feet, I never got a sense of the depth of emotion involved and I couldn't help feeling it was a opportunity lost.",7.0,Anonymous,History
More like watching a poem than a movie,"If you're looking for your typical Colin Farrell action movie, you'll definitely want to pass on this. If you like movies to be spoon-fed to you in bite-size plot points, you'll want to pass. Malicks New World is more like watching a poem than a movie.The New World traces the virgin paths of emotion and contemplation traveled by these characters inwardly as they encounter cultures and peoples of which they could not have conceived until now. I found a bittersweet melancholy in the way the inner journeys of Pocohantas (Q'Orianka Kilcher), Smith (Colin Farrell), and Rolfe (Christian Bale) reflect the outward struggle between the Europeans and this new world they have encountered.The movie was filmed to capture emotion and spirit, thus leaving the audience dizzy with the amour and confusion the characters experience together. The chemistry between the characters was gripping, and the romance elegantly and tastefully captured both visually and audibly in the ballet of prayers they whisper.I highly recommend The New World to anyone who enjoys artistic films. I only hope that we don't have to wait another eight years for another film from Malick.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Well crafted but simply misses the mark IMHO.,"I loved Thin Red Line....But I gotta say this movie just did not hit the mark. The cinematography is wonderful, the acting great as well. And although I love Malick, and Thin Red Line is far and away my favorite war move, I would wish there were more arcs in this. That is to say I wish the arc itself was more prominent. Malick tends to emphasize beauty and atmosphere it seems over plot or even melodrama, which is great, but this might be pushing it. Thin Red Line, I suppose, had the benefit of being a remake, and although one could call this a remake of course, it really isn't if you look at it objectively.I, respectfully, have to give this one a thumbs down for anyone but hardcore movie/history/Christian Bale/ or Colin Farrel fans.acexec",6.0,Anonymous,History
This is no Hollywood Blockbuster.....it's Art.,"This film is a painting come to life. Malick is a really special film maker and this is a real jewel. His long shots give the actors time to actually convey emotion and there are some incredibly powerful moments in this film. Being of Native ancestry and a student of Native history the attention to detail as far as costuming and sets.......amazing. The actually story line? Somewhat skewed from the real story.....but the real story would take a 4 day film to truly convey and it's hard enough to keep people's attention for more than 90 minutes in a theater. The important points are all there. The standout here is Kilcher, a real stunning debut....so graceful and emotionally complex. Body language is abundant and rightly so, the meetings of the English and the ""Naturals"" was as odd as an alien invasion. Most communication is through the eyes......and is brilliantly displayed here. I must say that this a great cinematic experience. The only thing that bummed me out about the film, wasn't the film at all, it was a few in the audience that exclaimed at the closing credits....""thank god!! that was so long!!!""......""so boring!"" , which is typical of your average meat head, movie goer just looking for explosions and fart jokes. Which leads me to believe that's why in the film they keep Pocahontas(Kilcher) chest covered. In reality, during warmer months, Native men and women were almost completely naked and painted in some way or another. I'm sure Malick wanted to go for authenticity, but it's the repressed society that we live in would have had a field day with a 15 year old girl going topless AND running around with Colin Farrell. Running time is around 3 hours with not a frame wasted. Anyway, All the performances were outstanding, with special kudos going to Raoul Trujillo who plays Tomoco AND choreographed all the Native dancing as well as Christian Bale giving John Rolfe a face. Bravo. A must see in the theater.......and see it in a good theater with a good sound system. Well worth the price of admission.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"there might be a great film in here somewhere, but I just didn't see it as much as others have","Terence Malick's The New World is something that I really did want to find to be the brilliant, breathtaking, mesmerizing visual masterpiece that some have been calling it (apparently though it is one of the most audience divided films of 2005 for those who have seen it). In a couple of ways it is unique- Malick takes on the history of this time and puts his visual look onto the era, and wants to say to the audience through his form of poetry/philosophy 'come, look at all this, the lands, the rivers, the Native people soon to be tainted by the West'.In a way he tries to treat the period piece much like Kubrick did with some of his films. But the problem then comes, how do you really draw a viewer into the story? Kubrick could do this because there was something intriguing and involving about the characters, with the pace corresponding with the emotional pull. Malick, however, loses sight of the narrative at times, at least to me. If the film is more about the journey than the destination, too often the film finds itself looking for a narrative pull, and as the story does move along, it's done so in a muddled way through narration that either works OK for some parts, and in others is totally unnecessary. It's like the filmmaker has a definite passion for the period, and for these near icon characters of American history, and yet is too wrapped up in visuals to correspond with the dialog.Colin Farrell's performance in the New World, Terence Malick's fourth film, is one of the better parts of the picture, as well as the performances from Christian Bale and first-timer Q'Orianka Kilcher. At the same time there is a kind of strange quality to their performances, they're also observant, subdued, and trying to get their own grasp of the material, and for the most part it works. Kilcher in particular gives off something here that is both touching and maybe, in a way, off-putting.I liked a lot how she would not be too over-emotional in scenes that could go terribly wrong with first-time actors, though at the same time she could also be quite aloof in certain scenes, and maybe a little one-tone. But maybe that is what Malick was looking for, more of the 'presence' of these actors in these roles than the actual full-on strengths. It becomes one of the interesting points in this film that acting out such textbook/museum people like John Smith, John Rolfe, and Pocahontas, becomes as much of a challenge to take in as the rest of the picture.This review, I suppose, may be rather subjective, though in a way that is almost a compliment to Malick. This is a work of a true auteur, who does side-step the possible pit-falls of a mainstream Hollywood director, and makes the film he wants to on his terms. If it was just a silent film, for example, I might be even more fascinated in what occurs. But unlike my favorite work of his, Badlands, there is a distance put between the audience and characters that isn't achieved so well. Maybe I'll respond to it more on a repeat viewing, as some films often need. But one time in the theater was enough for me.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Slow, inaudible, and unwatchable","I really had a lot of patience for this movie to get going. I sat there for over 20 minutes, in between the bad and displaced classical music, to see the plot between the characters. And nothing. The sound quality was just awful throughout and that was only the first of the major annoyances.Sure, the fort of Jamestown was accurate, but I hardly think those peoples spoke in parables and poems the entire time. The dialogue was about as misplaced as the latest Australian version of ""MacBeth"", with Shakespearan language and modern scenery and weapons. Getting to the point, the dialogue was unreal in a bad way.I don't remember ever reading about Captain Smith having such a fancy sword for such an average man at the time. I wish it was more straight forward with real dialogue so the audience could get into it. The director did a much better job in Saving Private Ryan. But this was a waste of time. Thin Red Line wasn't too much better than this, but at least it was better.Overall, its unfortunate that this is the only movie with historical Jamestown shown in it. ""F""",1.0,Anonymous,History
Absolutely beautiful,"I love Terrence Malick's style and if I was to become a director,he would be a director I would look to for influence.I'd actually put this on a par with Badlands but superior to The Thin Red Line.Everything is so lush and otherworldly in this film, from the unblemished America to the stately English gardens. Although this is Malick's show there is a fantastic performance from Q'rianka Kilcher, and Farrell seems as graceful as he will ever be.The New World is so beautiful that many films will seem brash after you see it.Transcendental cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,History

I went to see the historical action/romance movie and what I saw was an artsy/fartsy waste of time. I actually laughed out loud for most of this movie because it was so terrible. Stay away from this movie at all costs unless you want a good laugh or a snooze...or if you enjoy pretending to be sophisticated by watching artsy/fartsy movies. If you went to see Brokeback Mountain, this may be a movie for you. To the average Joe/Jane out there, I would recommend staying away from this disaster.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"It's an acquired taste, or in Malicks case, style.","I think with Malicks' films, you either connect with it or you don't. I did just that with 'The Thin Red Line' and was curious to see if I would with 'New World'. I guess I did in a different way, although maybe after more viewings(DVD), I may be able to break it down better.Quite honestly movie studios just don't make movies like this anymore, and if they do it's not with the budget that Malick had. His primary use of letting the images speak for themselves sans dialog is huge here. And with that, his musical scores, this one by James Horner(Braveheart/Titantic), play a integral part with the lack of dialog.No special effects, no artificial lighting, and I believe shot 80% with a 'steadycam' for full 360's(no track) gives you breathtaking scenery in the most natural sense. A hard edge, realism.I thought the acting was first rate, again since most was non-speaking. The ability to convey emotion without speaking has got to be the epitome of real 'acting'. Farrell, Kilcher, and Bale played the parts respectively.I'm not sure what creative license was taken in terms of the story. My wife is a teacher and recognized many things that she believed to be true, but I'm sure certain events were altered. All in all it's a powerful film. But one that requires the viewer to 'let go', and not be swayed by the current Hollywood style of pace and flow that movies today are filmed by.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"chaotic, incomprehensible dialog, too long, no discernible plot","Biggest waste of time ever, Anyone who would edit a film with black dissolves instead of editing material to flow from one scene to another should be producing stills for 3-D viewers. Most of dialog completely inaudible, leaving one to guess as to names of characters, relationships etc. Development of affection between John Smith and Pocahontas (never called by name)consists of ""meaningful glances"" which could be confused with indigestion. At one time colony seems to be down to about 10 people and then during the battle scene there seems to be dozens, if not hundreds. Background music bears no relation to flow of film, too loud during dialog exchanges and non existing during tedious shrubbery and grass pampas scenes. All in all a completely unsatisfactory rendering of a historical dramatic period with many fascinating characters.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Stunning work,"We are familiar with the tale of the founding of the first English Colony at Jamestown, Virginia in the year 1607. Most likely we do not give it much thought. It's story resides in musty text books and High School history class memories. Whereas the names of Pocahontas, John Smith and the Indian Chief Powhatan live on in legend, little else than the recollection that the princess saved the life of the John Smith from her father can be brought to mind. This pinpoint in history has permeated our consciousness through popular media, Songs like, ""Fever"" tell of the love of Pocahontas, and movies such as the recent Disney animated tale, repeat the telling.Director Terrence Malick, in his movie, ""The New World"" uses his unique vision, and presents us not so much an historical chronology, nor a torrid love story, but rather an acutely observed, yet impressionistic vision of the events that transpired from the first contacts of the colonists with the Indians, to the establishment of a viable settlement.The early scenes depicting interactions between Smith's men, and the curious yet unpredictable, ""naturals"" are striking. The directors style allows the viewer to share in the wonders and discoveries of the new world and it's people, we see how it must have looked. Fear and wonder are intertwined as we view the clash of the cultures.Director Malick is a visual poet. This is a movie of moods; lights and shadows painted by nature are overlaid with the historical events that transpired. Details are keenly observed as well as historically accurate. The look of the film is authentic and well researched, Yet Malick is after more than just a historical narrative. It is telling, that the name Pocahontas is never spoken, rather we see the young girl, playing in the fields, a beautiful sight, and one that captivates us, as well as John Smith. Nor is the narration linear, we first experience events through the eyes of John Smith as played by Colin Farrell, we hear his thoughts in voice-over. The narrative switches later on, to Pocahontas, played by the young Q'Orianka Kilcher. She says very little at first, but is eloquent with her movements and expressions. Her character grows from playful and curious, to sober and pensive, as she assimilates into the Colonists life style. Late in the film, the narrative switches once more, to another character, John Rolfe, Pocahontas's suitor played wistfully by Christian Bale.Although set in the sixteen hundreds, Malicks tale stylistically reminds me of Stanley Kubric's classic, ""2001 A Space Odyssey"" in it's presentation and telling. Most particularly with it's use of music and sound. Composer James Horner has created a score subtle sometimes, even minimalist, yet when combined with the cinematography, undeniably powerful.The film runs a long and leisurely 135 minutes. The tempo of the movie is deliberate, and I did not mind as the director lingered on a sunset or the play of water to help establish a mood. The pristine shots of Virginia's natural beauty, and the sound design capturing the sounds of a meadow, alive with birds and animals calls, creates with bold strokes a natural yet unfamiliar tableau.The film covers an undetermined passage of time, and what we see, advances time in jumps and spurts, The film lingers on the early contacts of settlers and Indians. We experience the beginnings of the settlement, through the first bitter cold winter, then the film jumps ahead to a later point where the settlers have to defend themselves against harrowing attacks as the Indians realize that these visitors intend to stay. We see the fledgling colony grow, and trade established with several tribes. There is even a visit to England, and the court of King James the first, by Pocahontas and John Rolfe, that provides contrast from the rustic life in the Colony.If you are short of attention, and the thought of a movie without special effects worries you, it would be best to let this film pass, but if you are open to Malick's vision, the film experience is indeed akin to discovering a new world.

There's a longer version coming out on DVD,"I love Terrence Malick's three previous films, and I liked much of ""The New World"" but it felt jumbled somehow to me. As if the editing had been rushed and the film had not quite gelled. Since my faith in the director's talent and integrity is immense, I decided to see it again to try to 'get' whatever I was missing from a first viewing. So I attended a screening today at which producer Sarah Green spoke, and the audience was informed that the version that was released in December for Academy Award consideration, has since been replaced by a version 15 minutes shorter (which was not shown). She assured us we ""wouldn't notice"" the changes. Then we were informed that Malick has already produced a three hour cut he intends to release on DVD. It's a sad state of affairs when one of the world's greatest directors can't release his presumably preferred version of a film to theaters - it has to be relegated to the home video market. In the trailer now being shown on the movie's website there seemed to be scenes and dialog which are not in the version I saw.UPDATE: October 18, 2008 The 172 minute version has been released.

First, if your researched the history books, you would know that Pocahontas and Captain John Smith did not have romantic feelings for each other, in fact, when she saw him in England years later, she referred to John Smith as ""father"".

One of the most hauntingly beautiful movies I've seen in years.,"I just got back from the New World. It moved to a discount theater where I live and I didn't want to miss it. Even with the small the children running around and the old couple behind me who kept talking, I was completely sucked into the movie.The scene opens with ships arriving in Virginia, 1607. You see the sailors stare out at the wilderness, fascinated by its untamed beauty. You see ""The Naturals"" or Native Americans watch the ships with fear and curiosity. No words are spoken, but the pictures tell more that anyone could ever describe.The use of images and the cinematography are breathtaking. Mixed in with a haunting score by James Howard and you get one of the most beautiful, thought provoking films this year.People in the theater grew restless or left because some would find this movie slow. The problem is that people aren't used to just images and music in a movie. They want action thrown into their face throughout the whole film. If you come to ""The New World"" expecting constant action and dialogue, then you might as well not go at all.It's not a story of action and the violent clash between the English and the Native Americans. It's a story of exploration, love, and the birth of a new world.For being one of the most beautiful movies I've seen all year, I give ""The New World"" a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
You'll either love it or hate it,"I didn't know much about The New World when I went to see it in the movies. I had few hours to pass and some critics gave the movie rave reviews. I'm glad I like all kinds of movies and not just adventure and action movies because The New World is more a historical romantic drama. The movie shows the beauty of unspoiled nature of America, the Indians living there and how the settlers affect Pocahontas and her life. Pocahontas is an innocent child of the nature and beautiful in mind, soul and body. The first American John Smith falls for her for obvious reasons. The love between Pocahontas and Smith isn't shown through words but thoughts. To me that gave much depth to the affair and the characters. The movies soundtrack is also wonderful really setting the mood. Besides about the beauty of the untouched America, clash of the cultures and the romance between John Smith and Pocahontas the movie is about the insanity of man. The settlers were lead with someone having a medal in his neck and so being the leader seemed like children playing to me. Most actors do a great job including Christian Bale one of my favorite actors at the last half of the movie. I didn't know how the story of Pocahontas and John Smith went before the movie so it was exciting to see how it developed. In the end when I left the theater the movie left me moved. With so many things pulled off in such a good way how could it not. The movie is very artistic so you will either love it or hate it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Footnote to Days of Heaven -- but what a footnote.,"I saw ""Days of Heaven"" exactly 27 years ago today. I remember thinking as I was driving home, this man (Terrence Malick) will never be able to top himself. As a artist he had gone as far as he possibly could go. He would never get out of those wheat fields. In other words, I was in religious awe of what he had accomplished.Perhaps Terry agreed, because he was not to make another movie for 20 years.Malick is, I believe, obsessed with myth. Days of Heaven is a retelling of the biblical myth of Abraham and Sarah, transformed and reset in turn of the century America. But the story Pocahantas has no biblical counterpart. This is pure American, and the telling of the story is as fresh as it can be. That it is an American myth speaks well for this country and its history. True, Malick pulls his punches on both sides, but the movie has a look and feel of astonishing historical reality. The Indians are as frightening as they are fascinating, the settlers are as desperate as they are determined. Tragedy under such circumstances was inevitable, but what linger is a tale of such beauty and poignancy, it may not be possible to do the story again -- though I am certain at some future time, someone will try.Technically, the film is a marvel. This is Kilcher's movie and she carries it wonderfully. 2005 was a great year for young girl actresses (Dakota Fanning, Georgia Henley), but Kilcher surpasses them all. The male leads offer great support to her performance: tough and taciturn (perhaps a bit too taciturn in the case of Colin Ferrell). I especially liked that all the characters were treated with respect. I kept waiting for the obligatory evil white guy to say something like; ""Don't want no injun in our town . .. ."" Didn't happen. These are real people on all sides trying to cope with a situation well beyond their control or understanding. But they rise to the doomed occasion wonderfully.There is truth here even if (parts of it) didn't happen (or at least we are highly unsure if the particular events happened.)See the movie. Yes, there are plenty of echoes of Days of Heaven (yes, Malick will never get out of those wheat fields), but it doesn't hold the movie back. Unreservedly recommended as the best film of 2005 (which was, in retrospect, a good year.)",10.0,Anonymous,History
"""Obsession"" by Terrence Malick","I, like many others, have read the astounding reviews laid upon Terrence Malick's new film ""The New World."" US Weekly calls it""Oscar-worthy""; even more trusted critics such as Richard Roeper have called it ""One of the best movies of the year . . . a work of great passion and visual poetry"" while Richard Corliss of Time Magazine has declared ""Anyone who has keen eyes will surely go soaring and crashing with the lovers lost in Malick's exotic, erotic new world."" We are independent-thinking movie-goers, yet when we do our research and see reviews such as these, we are right to assume that the film is at least worthy of a theater viewing. Surely, with reviews like this, we can safely assume that it, at the very least, won't be a waste of our time.However, while the numerous glowing reviews of Terrence Malick's latest foray onto the big screen mainly tell us why we must go see this film, they also indirectly tell us something far more important and useful: that critics are sometimes so misaligned with the tastes of the general public that they unwittingly guide them to a film that breaks their pocketbooks as well as their patience.Let me explain.I was one of the people that read the reviews of those I trusted, and decided to go to see the film based on their tastes and expertise. After all, the film starred Colin Farrell (whose career hasn't taken a right turn since Minority Report) and was directed by Terence Malick (who had directed the similarly overrated The Thin Red Line); I needed a little extra assurance that I wasn't walking into another Malick-induced coma. I got the assurance, and went to Grauman's Chinese on Saturday night to give both artists a fair shot at my good graces. . . .At its bare bones, The New World recounts the English arrival in Virginia circa 1607 and how Captain John Smith (played by Colin Farrell) is capured by the ""naturals,"" only to be saved from death by the young, beautiful Pocahontas (played by Q'orianka Kilcher). They fall in love, through a series of events she is taken in by the English, and she is eventually taken back to England.Even though the film pushes the three-hour mark, this is all you need to know; many will go into this film already knowing the general story, which is definitely to their advantage, for you won't be able to decipher much more than this basic outline over the course of the film anyways.Terrence Malick's The New World is a long, hapharzardly edited, disjointed, syrupy, narratively-vacant, nature-laden snoozefest that fails to broaden the mind or rouse the emotions on any level. Our director simply can't seem to get enough of filming our principals frollicking through the forest through their barely audible whispery interior monologues, which seems to take up about a third of the film. Smith and Pocahontas look at each other lovingly by a river as her breathy voice-over beginsÂ—cut to a tree swaying in the windÂ—cut to the riverÂ—cut to a birdÂ—cut to her neck. These voice-overs and woodsy love montages occur so often that the film frequently plays like an obscenely long Calvin Klein Obsession commercial. This might have been negligible had there been some redeeming qualities to the other parts of the film.For example, when we get a reprieve from the empty love story and get back to camp, we can barely understand the English adventurers through their thick English accents. Were they in danger? Were they starving? Why was that guy just shot? Had I understood what exactly they were saying, it might have added some much-needed depth and direction to the storyline, but since it doesn't we're left to guess for ourselves (which we shouldn't have to do, by the way). Somehow, I think that even people watching this movie in England were asking each other, ""What the bloody hell did that guy just say?"" The film also has a habit of jumping from event to event without telling how or why we got there. Once again, the fact that I could barely hear what people were saying I'm sure played an integral part in this, but it eventually seemed as if Malick had no idea what story he was telling. How can we find our way through a film if it doesn't look like even the director could? This is all very unfortuante for the actors, because Malick has managed to amass a very talented cast. Newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher, in her feature debut, emodies the innocence, playfulness, and beauty of Pocahontas, and is thoroughly watchable. Christian Bale is a fully capable young actor, and yet even his character must resort to those insufferable, stale voiceovers. Colin Farrell has the expressions and non-verbal acting elements down, yet for reasons still unknown to this movie-goer, he decides to keep his Irish accent for his portrayal of an undoubtedly English John Smith, which was just downright annoying. The soul of the film is Kilcher, whose performance most escapes the mutlitude of flaws that pervade this film. If there is a ""saving grace"" for this film, it is her.Bottom line: There is an audience for this film. I would say that if you were able to follow and enjoy The Thin Red Line, then go ahead and give it a shot. Some people love Terrence Malick, and those people should in turn love this movie. However, if you're one of those strange people who needs to understand what's going on and some pretty nature shots just isn't going to cut it, for the love of God, stay away from this movie. This film is just not in the same league as Match Point, Brokeback Mountain, or Good Night, and Good Luck.If you don't trust me, trust the three couples that trickled out of the theater over the course of the first 1.5 hours.",3.0,Anonymous,History

"Boring? No, just slow paced","Cinema is an art, also it is an entertainment yes, but it makes me really sad that ""such kind of"" movies are seen as dull pieces by a lot of people especially by youths. Because it doesn't serve crowds to please them. In that way, The New World is not an entertainment movie may be, there are no humorous lines, no lots of action, no typical romance, but this does not mean that it is not enjoyable. ""Nothing happens in the movie!"" is the most typical statement probably used for such kind of movies or sometimes you probably come across titles like ""boooooooringgggg"". I want to confess that I am a person who does not easily get bored, in fact, I rarely get bored by a movie, but of course there are movies which I found extremely dull, but because those movies were lack of any emotion, any effect and even spirit, because I found nothing impressive, but The New World is not such a movie absolutely. I did not get bored at all, I did not get bored even a minute! Honestly, I don't always agree with people, when they call a movie poetic, probably because it sounds like pseudo intellectualism to me, but The New World is really poetic. One more confess, I am not a Terrence Malick fan, so I haven't found all of his movies great or excellent, but The New World was great and my favorite one with The Thin Red Line. The direction is great except the fact that at times the movie is a bit disconnected, between the transitions, but if we think that this is a visual poem, then it is not a flaw. This is a flowing like a river and relieving like a poem movie. No need to say that visually the movie is very beautiful, the cinematography is mesmerizing. Personally, Colin Farrell and Christian Bale are two of my favorite actors (of course this is one of the reasons that I liked the movie), but other than that, they are great actors, especially Bale and their characters are interesting. And when Bale takes on the stage, the movie becomes greater. May be, as one of the sub stories in the movie, a foreign man is captured by a tribe, at first they decide to kill him, but then something changes their mind or the foreigner falls in love with a girl in the tribe is a pretty clichÃ© or dated idea, but it dissolves in this unusual film thanks to Malick. As a male, I had been seriously afraid of watching a dull romance, but definitely it was not! and unexpectedly, it was also free from clichÃ©s and realistic. The elegant final part that recalls costume dramas is a separate beauty, even if a twist at the end is pretty far fetched. Finally, alienation (from society, culture and by modernization) is reflected well. An adventure, a tale, The New World.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Pretty But Very Very Empty,"Terrence Malick is the director who became more and more revered the longer he refrained from making films. What this meant was that when he finally started making films again critics had invested so much in his legend that whatever he turned out would be acclaimed a masterpiece by some. So it turned out as people fell over themselves to praise the not very good ""Thin Red Line"". Some of that effect still lingers with ""The New World"", but noticeably more muted. It's as if people are finally waking up to the truth that Malick's film-making gifts have actually atrophied in his long lay off. ""The New World"" is a not very accurate retelling of the Pocohontas story. It has the usual Malick traits of flat acting, voice-overs and stunning cinematography. Unfortunately the weakness of the film merely shows how limited pretty pictures are in their own right. Some have described this as poetic (always a dodgy term in cinema). If it is it's poetry on the level of a Patience Strong not a Tennysson (let alone a 20th century poet). Malick refuses to challenge his audience as a true artist would (unless you count the challenge of staying awake). If you want to see a masterly updating of Native American stories see Michael Mann's brilliant ""Last Of The Mohicans"".

Every school in the nation should be required to show this to history students.

A masterful achievement from a technical and artistic standpoint,"Writer-director Terrence Malick's depiction of 17th century British expedition to found new colony in Jamestown, Virginia is a masterful achievement from a technical and artistic standpoint...yet, it is so low-keyed that it rarely comes to life. This is the work of a great cinematic auteur, but one exits ""The New World"" (particularly in its mammoth, 172-minute ""extended version"") feeling unmoved. As depicted, the expedition isn't heightened in excitement with bold characterizations or rousing action; the filmmaker keeps the scenario in check, preferring to let the narrative unfold carefully (some may argue too cautiously). This is an intellectual's version of a history lesson, and some viewers may be put off by the slow pace. Colin Ferrell (heavily bearded--and with alert but haunted eyes) portrays Captain John Smith, who becomes a doomed prisoner of the Natives before having his life spared by the chief's doe-eyed daughter, Pocahontas. Their love affair verges dangerously close to Blue Lagoon territory (lots of chaste, bare shoulder-rubbing and half-kisses in montage), though Malick shows a surprising vulnerability in these instances (he displays the dawning of new and tremulous emotions with a kind of naked purity). The mutiny which ensues between the British and the ""savages"" is brutal and hard-hitting; however, the human drama at the heart of the picture seems stretched out too long. Malick doesn't tiptoe through the tangled relationships, but his focus does tend to stray. Christian Bale's role as smitten new settler John Rolfe is flattened as a result; he never takes on any dimension. Rolfe is an unenviable romantic substitute for an absentee Smith, and when he and Pocahontas go through the whole courting thing all over again, it just feels like a repeat. As an artistic and visceral achievement, ""The New World"" is vivid, brooding and intense. As an entertainment, per se, it lacks an inner fire that is necessary to envelop a wide audience. Malick isn't indifferent to the people on-screen, but one gets the impression he's far more interested in the erotic, swirling waters, the crackling lightning in the cloudy skies, and the forms and figures of the muscular Native Americans as seen in silhouette or by firelight. Do the central characters become important and real to us? Not very. ** from ****",4.0,Anonymous,History
The Should-Be Front Runner for Best Picture,"""The New World"" is a perfect fit for Terrence Malick's film-making style. He is the film equivalent of Ansel Adams with his astounding ability to capture beautiful, natural landscapes.Malick begins the film with a lot of landscapes and shots of the English settlers surveying this new land that gives the viewer the feeling that they are seeing a foreign land for the first time. The pacing at the beginning of the movie is admittedly slow, and and remains at that pace for most of the movie. This pacing works on every level since the film covers three developing relationships; that of the settlers and the land, Pocahantas and John Smith, and Pocahantas and John Rolfe.The film's relationships are also beautifully written. John Smith is truly infatuated with Pocahantas and the native culture. When they interact Pocahantas is often seen running freely through the grasses and they are often alone acting outside of the constraints of their colliding cultures.John Smith is also dealing with the inherent beauty in not only Pocahantas' character, but the culture that the natives inhabit. Although they are primitive and the British are clearly more advanced, Smith acknowledges that what they have is unique and he is ambivalent towards the British intention to colonize their land and although he truly loves Pocahantas and the Indian culture, his eventual decision to leave her is made with her interests in mind and an unwillingness to end a freedom that only exists in the environment she has grown up in.The romance between John Rolfe and Pocahantas is a stark contrast to that of Pocahantas and John Smith. Rolfe is the consummate British colonial force, a tobacconist in the New World to further his fortune and status. He has no consideration for what his love for Pocahantas could mean for her and consequently she is taught English, begins to wear dresses and high heels, and converts to Christianity before their eventual marriage. Although this can be seen as advancement, and undoubtedly is, the vibrant, inexplicable, raw quality that she previously possessed nearly disappears, clearly stifled by British colonialism.The settlers colonial efforts and battles with the native tribes mirror these events, and although a sidebar to the film's relationships, also help to establish the film's themes. Malick's choice to shoot the film on the rare 65mm film stock not only makes this a unique and beautiful viewing experience, but significantly aids in establishing the native culture's inherent beauty.Colin Farrell and Christian Bale both do very good jobs with their respective characters, but the shining star is Q'Orianka Kilcher. The film really settles on her shoulders and both her and Malick deserve credit for this performance that is almost silent, yet perfectly embodies the qualities unique to her people. Watching the changes in her mannerisms from her interaction with Smith to her relationship with Rolfe creates pathos both for her and for her tribe.This film is immensely rich and the film's ending beautifully captures Malick's observations on the end of this culture. Yet, as the credits began to roll the cinema - goer's around quickly began laughing and/or complaining. For a passive observer this film is a complete bore, but to one open to a journey that is established visually this film is easily the best release of the past year.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The slowest moving movie I've ever seen!,"I have to admit, I was extremely excited to watch this movie. I thought it was going to be romantic, touching and spell binding movie. However, I did not go and see it in the theaters, I rented it shortly after it came out and I am glad that I did not waste my money at the theater.I thought it was an extremely slow movie. The plot seemed to drag on and on with no point whatsoever. They could have cut half the scenes in the movie, it would still make sense and i would still have 2 hours of my life left.Don't get me wrong, all you Colin Farrell fans out there. I am a huge fan of Colin, however in a movie like this, there is only so much that a good looking leading man can do.So overall, The New World is a waste of time to watch. If it was chopped in half and had quicker moving scenes then it would be an OK movie. If you have the chance to read this comment before you watch this movie i beg you to not watch it and save 3 hours of your life for something more important!",3.0,Anonymous,History
very good movie,"This movie was different than what I thought. There was a lot more romance than what I expected. I expected for it to be mainly about the struggles and politics between the settlers and Indians with the romance between John Smith and Pocahontas as a supporting plot. It started out that way but then the romance part basically took over.It seemed slow moving, but it was a wonderfully acted movie which is the reason why I gave it an eight out of ten score. The ending was rather abrupt and really needs to be redone, but I enjoyed it. The acting that really locked me in and grabbed my attention was the acting on the part of the indians - especially Pocohantis. She and the other indians really captured the essence of the native American Indians. Their emotions, form of humor, entertainment, politics, and temperament was very well portrayed by the cast - especially Pocohantis. The biography on her shows she is only fifteen. If this is accurate then she has a very bright future ahead of her. I will be disappointed if she doesn't win an award. Best acting performance I have seen since Denzel Washington in Training Day. I know they are two completely different roles, but Washington did a great job of portraying a corrupt cop just the same was as Kilcher portrayed Pocohantis.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Prepare yourself for something spiritual,"OK, I'm a massive admirer of Terrence Malick. I think he is the greatest living filmmaker. His films touch part of my psyche that are left unmoved by any other filmmaker. But... Nothing, repeat NOTHING prepared me for the sensory explosion that is The New World. I had been following the production for over 18 months, watching the trailer online... counting the days... But I was worried. Some suggestions that Malick have over-reached himself, was self-indulgent... And Malick's style of cinema is so fragile, it could fall apart. So with optimism, but trepidation I took the plunge... and - oh joy, oh bliss, this is truly heaven.Why is it so wonderful? The only word I can give is that it, unlike any film that I have seen since the death of Bresson (except, maybe, Flowers of Shanghai), is deeply, deeply spiritual. We have familiar Malick motifs - the wind on the grass, the shots of the sky reflected in water from The Thin Red Line - but here that take on a completely new and more satisfying meaning, for Malick's concern is with man in his purest communion with nature. The 'naturals' are precisely that - at one with nature. Malick uses his poetic imagery to set our senses aglow with the sheer wonder and of purity of the indigenous lifestyle. This is cinema at the level of what I can only term 'super-expression' - imagery communicates complex interaction between things and the way our senses perceive them, but it does so at an incredibly elevated level. The most remarkable thing for the casual viewer is how much Malick manages to express complex and wonderful things completely without dialogue. John Smith (Colin Farrell) barely speaks to his own people, let alone his indigenous captors. Yet we sense what he is thinking through Malick's absolutely magnificent use of imagery and sound.There are other motifs. People hold hands. They express themselves through their breathing. And, yet again, Malick has found a wonderful vehicle for his vision in the form of Q'Orianka Kilcher. Her screen presence and the range of emotions that she suggests with so little dialogue is little short of miraculous.For people who love the cinema not just on the basis of the quality of the stories that it tells, but the manner in which it tells them, this must be one of the films of the decade. Many people have said that the cinema is like a language, but that is to belittle it. It is not like A language, it is simply like language itself. And just as there are many languages, there are many cinemas - that is forms of cinema. And in each language there are masters of the language who excel in expressing themselves in poetry and in prose. In English we had Shakespeare and Oscar Wilde. Now, in 'poetic cinema' at a higher level even than Stan Brakhage, we have Terrence Malick. Yes, The New World is THAT good. See it. See it. See it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
how could they make one of our great stories so boring?,"I have to say, as a history major I went into this moving with hope that it would do justice to the fact that history is interesting and that people should appreciate their past. I walked out thinking I should reconsider my major. This movie turned what could have been an epic into 10 minutes of dialog and 2 hours of watching people walk, just walk. The acting was superb, when they were actually given the chance to act and not just walk. With this cast and story I was hoping for so much, and it in no way delivered. While the cast, costumes, and scenery were all superb it meant nothing. There was no script to give it a backbone. I'm sorry to say that this movie was a 2 out of 10, it wasted my time on this earth that I will never get back.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Malick's finest,"Including even Pocket Money, Malick's films are all about how much nicer it is to live out of town, beyond the mundane cotton mill of everyday life, while noting some of the potential challenges and costs of doing so, in regard to love, place in society, and life expectancy. This film, no different, is vast and incredible, riveting despite an appearance of slowness. Subtle storytelling that furthers innocence and sweetness. Honest as to the ways in which people get involved with one another and begin acting on each others' behalves. Heart breaking, familiar, important. Perfectly cast. Colin Farrell's puckish public persona adds a layer of perceived (or real?) emotional immaturity to John Smith's character that explains, utterly, his priorities. The script is spare and perfect, delivering efficient dialogue and voice-overs that explain those things that always go undiscussed. Q'Orianka Kilcher is like the sun.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"A huge masterpiece riddled with flaws? Yes, compelling by the end for sure.","The New World (2005)This is surely some kind of masterpiece of a movie, though also plagued slightly by its length, by a tendency to sentiment, and by moments of wonder (by the characters) that get repetitive. Director Terrence Malick has left his mark here as with, say, ""Days of Heaven,"" creating something large but not quite larger than life. His intention is to make life as large as it really is.By some miracle I saw the whole thing and didn't know it was the Pocahontas story, which was terrific (though I jokingly said in the middle of it that she's like Pocahontas, having never seen the Disney version). This helped me keep a neutral stance on it all, thinking it was just a typical view of two cultures--European and Native American--coming into extensive, complicated interaction. The way you come to see the main young woman's view of the world, both the new world she live in and her own new world when she goes to England, is stirring. Stirring.That's what finally made the movie after having at times to be patient with the director's tendency to indulge in the beauty created by his crew, especially the cinematographers. This is an exquisitely luscious film in many ways--some might say excessively, the sunset always sublime and the verdant world green. But it makes for good watching. It's an immersive experience. It puts you there.The sets and the setting are superbly thought out and legitimate copies of what the first successful English settlers in Virginia would have seen and made. (There were lengthy documentary segments with my rented version of the movie.) The costumes, the thatch and wood structures, the general smoky rainy glimmery twilight moods, all of this was gorgeous.Most (nearly all) of the shooting was done with a hand held camera, what used to be called a steadicam. Even conventional dialog scenes where the camera shows someone talking reveals a little (gently buffered) camera movement. Other scenes have a constantly moving camera, fluid and jerky both. All of this gives the film from start to finish a living, breathing feeling. It's quite nice as a work for the eyes, no question about that.The editing is equally remarkable. Malick has lots of footage shot, and one thing this gives him is lots of options for editing, and indeed the mix of points of view is part of the visual energy of the whole. There are many moments where the edit is unexpected, or very sudden, or counterintuitive, which is elegantly sustained from start to finish.What is weak at times is some of the acting, or some of the choreographed movements, which seem a hair affected, or made to be cinematic rather than true. I suppose that's Malick's choice and a matter of taste. More annoying is the director's tendency to have characters stop and admire the bark on a tree or the light coming from overhead as they crane and look up. Yes, that's what you might do, all of us, but not over and over. And over. In the same way there are sometimes repeating moments that are not quite flashbacks that reprise an earlier mood and in fact it seems (to the slightly bedazzled viewer) that times have changed, that this is not quite where the characters are at any more.In all of Malick's movies he has a style with actors that often makes them restrained and even lifeless. It strikes me as terrible movie-making on some level (Brad Pitt in ""Tree of Life"" is hard to swallow), but I try to see it as style. That might be generous. You'll find Colin Farrell restrained, often, and mumbling, too, and what makes clear his lack of usual energy is the documentary videos of the same scenes where he's more himself. It's subtle, I think, but it's cumulative with all the actors over all the film. The one exception might be Pocahontas herself, played by American/Swiss/Quechua Peruvian actress (born in Germany) Q'orianka Kilcher. She's allowed to be utterly lively and a necessary spark amidst all these burly men.One thing Malick has going for him here is the story is epic and moving. The material is automatically interesting. He takes credit (as he always does) as the writer, but of course the story is not his, it's history. And it's a history brought to life. It's not for everyone, but it will survive even doubters on many levels, including for its ambition. This is a sprawling, unique movie and you should give it a try.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A short while for history,"The New World is my favourite film of Terrence Malick's. I liked the Thin Red Line alot, because it depicted war as war should be depicted and was, to the best of my knowledge, first depicted by Ernst JÃ¼nger in In Stahlgewittern (1920). But here we have a film that isn't just depicting a moment in time, but the eventual joining of two lines of human evolution after a seperation of more than 10000 years.While watching The New World cannot be accepted as an equivalent substitute for having actually been around all over this planet for the last 10000 years, it does open the mental pathways that allow a man to ponder the question what man has been doing all of this time.Very few films do that. Very few films give you a chance to reflect and compare. Not everything in The New World is quite believable, but there is enough texture, enough undeniable detail, that a realistic appraisal of the value of civilization is triggered.And although the film does take a side, it doesn't do so in a way that would prevent you from contemplating the virtue of the other side.While watching the Making Of I was amazed about how much more engaging Christian Bale is in real life than on film. I think he's muting himself too much. You can also do it too little (e.g. Tom Selleck), but I think he's doing it too much.Plummer plays adequately. Farrell looks sad as always, makes me wonder why anybody wanted him to play Alexander or Crockett. Here it fits better, but he still got on my nerves.Aynway, all the actors could do is to sink this film and they didn't. It is not a film that hinges on stellar performances like Le DÃ®ner de cons, for instance. No, the achievement here lies in the appearance of actuality, in doing away with the idea that you live in the 21st century and looking at a set or some plot of land set aside for scenic beauty next to a motorway. The achievement also lies in the sense of curiosity the film instills and that comes from not knowing why the director is showing you what he's showing you, i.e. that the plot of the film is not some transparent construct to make some specific point, but rather like a list of highlights on a sightseeing tour, which includes the necessary stops.",10.0,Anonymous,History
don't waste your money,"I also got a free ticket for an advanced screening of this film. From all the previews, the cinematography looked beautiful, and, as I'm somewhat of a history buff, I knew the background story was interesting... all in all, I was excited to see the movie.An hour into the movie, I was literally sitting there with my eyes closed thinking ""hmm...this is nice nap music."" The only reason I rated this movie a 2 instead of a 1 is because the cinematography did hold up...it was beautifully done. And the costuming and location were very authentic. Other than that, the movie left a LOT to be desired. The script was TERRIBLE. Most of the dialogue (if you can call it that) wasn't spoken aloud, but rather were thoughts of the two main characters. It would be one thing if they were having profound and interesting thoughts...but they weren't. Collin Farrell constantly thinking, ""I love her. I made her love me. I want to love her in the wilderness."" And then Pocahontas', ""Come back to me. Mother guide me."" Blah, blah, blah, blah, BLAH! The lines that were ""thought"" and the things that were coming out of their mouths were just completely ridiculous. Even the battle scenes were lacking.After about an hour and a half, my friend and I actually got up and left. I don't think the movie was even half way done - Christian Bale hadn't even made an appearance yet. On our way back, we joked that the movie wasn't even worth the subway ride it took us to get to the theatre...and that if we were Christian Bale or Collin Farrell, we would be completely embarrassed to be a part of it. Honestly, sitting in the theatre I felt embarrassed for them. That uncomfortable, squirm in your seat, ""Aww, why are you doing this? You're better than this!"" feeling. Do you think that while people are filming a movie there is ever a point when they look at each other and just say, ""Wow...this is complete and total crap?"" I have a feeling The New World may have had one of these moments.If you REALLY want to see this movie, go ahead and pay to see it in the theatre... but for those who are just mildly interested, wait until they show it on TV.

Two And A Half Hours of My Life I'd Rather Have Back,"Unfortunately today I had the misfortune to see the supposedly 'epic' New World. I must admit that at first I was glad of the opportunity to witness what promised to be an exciting treatment of a largely unexplored cinematic and historiographical topic, but I must confess my severe disappointment. Malick's direction at first seems enticing, different and refreshing. However, after two hours of consistent repetition of the same directing techniques it begins to become a little wearisome. The film doesn't really seem to know what it is. To me it appears as a standard love story, but it keeps trying to be something more, which naturally results in a confusing and disjointed picture. Hence, it becomes across a film which is devoid of substance and movement. It struck me at the end that nothing really happens. Like 'Alexander', this film just seemed to serve as another excuse for Colin Farrell to appear moody and dejected on camera; a thoroughly dissatisfying experience.",2.0,Anonymous,History

The most tedious old dross I have ever sat through...,"since The Thin Red Line.If I was a Hollywood Exec and Terrence Malik came into my office to pitch a film to me I would have two reactions:1). Have him thrown out by security and given a kicking in the car park (I sat through the tedious dross that is The Thin Red Line.... )2). Agree to his ideas and fund it and then, once I had the completed final prints in my hand, put them on a shelf in the vaults, never to see the light of day again. $100M well spent - a public service you might say! When The Thin Red Line came out, I was really looking forward to seeing it. I thought it would be great to see a war film with George Clooney and John Cusack in. George Clooney (listed 4th on the poster) does casual violence really well and I am yet to see a film with John Cusack in that I didn't like.However, what did I get? A film where John Travolta appeared for about 2 minutes at the beginning, John Cusack was good - but suddenly and without explanation vanished, George Clooney (listed 4th on the bloody poster) for 2 minutes at the end, and a tedious narration all the way through by Sean Penn (can't we make him shut up...).Oh, and (lest we forget) countless hours of sunlight. The sun in the sky. Sunlight through trees. And sunlight on water...If you enjoyed The Thin Red Line, you'll probably like this, because Terence Malik has done it again. Yes, he's taken something interesting and made it as dull as ditch water. The New World is the story of Europeans going to America and treating the indigenous people like crap. And there are countless hours of sunlight. The sun in the sky. Sunlight through trees. And sunlight on water...Because of all the shots of sunlight, this film is about 27 hours long. Well, that's how long it feels. If you were to ask how more boring it could be, the answer would be none, none more boring.If you really want to watch this film, get Disney's Pocahontas instead. It might be as historically accurate as anything a politician ever tells you about ""under the previous government..."" but it won't be nearly so tedious. And you won't have a numb bottom. Or DVT.Damn, I hated that film. Boring, boring, boring.Do yourself a favour. Gouge your eyes out with spoons so you can never watch this rubbish by mistake.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Really Enjoyed,"I'm watching The New World because I'm taking a history through film class in school. This was one of the movies we watched together as a class. The New World is a story about Pocahontas and the settlers in Jamestown. It focuses a lot on John Smith's and John Rolfe's relationship with Pocahontas. The film follows them through when they first met and all the trials and conflicts they had to face. We watch the settlers land on the American soil and their very first interactions with the Natives, or in this film, the ""Naturals"". It shows us John Smith's journey as he lives with the Naturals and learns their ways, then it shows us all his trials once he returns and is elected the new president of Jamestown. The film displays both the settlers views and the Naturals views to the new changes of America, it helps us get a perspective of both sides, the differences and similarities and their opinions of each other. 
The filming in this movie was really high quality. The filmmaker added different angles than what we are used to but it all flowed together very well. There was a lot of great editing and very good definition and it was obvious the film was made fairly recently. There was also a quite recognizable actor, Christian Bale, who we know to be quite famous in this era. 
Most people are educated on the story of Pocahontas and we know that some of the events in this story didn't quite line up with things we've heard before. For example we know that Pocahontas never sees John Smith again once he leaves. We also know that Pocahontas is a lot younger than she is portrayed in most of the films about her. Aside from the Disney version of Pocahontas, I've never seen a film about her or about Jamestown. However, I did get to visit Virginia this last summer and on our way to Williamsburg we got to see the exact spot the settlers landed and we were able to drive through the area Pocahontas and her tribe once lived. 
A few things I really liked about this film is that John Smith wasn't portrayed by the typical blonde guy, giving him darker hair made him seem tougher and gave him an image as if he's been through a lot. The filming used while displaying the Naturals normal ways was so serene and peaceful, I really enjoyed those certain shots, especially the ones shot of Pocahontas in the fields from time to time. There wasn't a whole lot of dialog in this film I noticed, but it is still fairly easy to follow the storyline and that was something I particularly enjoyed. One thing I didn't like, however, was the way they made it seem as if Pocahontas didn't really love John Rolfe and had no desire to marry him. It seemed as if she was just marrying him to please him, this may actually be the case but I would rather have her love the man she is marrying and sharing a child with.
This film was one I really enjoyed. I love history and watching it portrayed in a way such as this film makes it even more interesting because it shows us the perspective that other people have of the story. Although I liked it, I probably would not watch it again. It was quite long and not something that would be entertaining more than once. However, I would like to watch more films made by this director, he seems to have a good taste in what people like and there was a lot of aesthetic appeal to it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
This is a terrible movie,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen since Alexander. Now I can exclude movies like Cry Wolf and Boogyman because they are not intended for an audience that The New World brings in. With that said the editing was terrible. The story was almost impossible to follow, mainly because of that. The length was unjustified. If this is the true story of Pocahontas than I have to ask myself why is she so important to history? I am not one to watch the time to see when a movie will end but I was every five minuets. Somewhere near an hour left in the movie I was saying JUST END! I can only warn people to stay away from this movie. There is always a reason why a film gets postponed for as long as this one did.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"My review on the extended cut of The New World, a philosophical and realistic take on the story","The New World is written and directed by Terrence Malick, who is a magnificent filmmaker and he captured the story perfectly. Whilst the extended cut is 3 hours long and possibly unneeded, I appreciate and really like the director's preferred version. There's a whole hour of extra material for the film and it adds a lot of character development and beautiful shots. Also giving us a more fleshed out story, plus a better character study on the characters of Pocahontas and the two love interests.The film depicts the founding of Jamestown, Virginia. It also tells the life story of Pocahontas of the Powhatan tribe and the historical figures Captain John Smith and Englishman John Rolfe who played a big part of her life when they arrived by ship to Virginia. The film and story moves in a very slow pace, showing the inner thoughts and state of mind of the three characters. The philosophical dialogues and voice overs can be too much for certain people but I liked it, Terrence's dialogue and attention to detail in making everything authentic and realistic was a nice touch.Q'orianka Kilcher's performance is the best, she's truly terrific as Pocahontas. Colin Farrell plays John Smith whilst Christian Bale plays John Rolfe. The supporting cast includes well known actors, the casting was done so well.Beautifully filmed and the imagery flows so well with the voice over of Pocahontas, Smith and Rolfe's thoughts, being philosophical and poetic, the cinematography is some of the best I've seen and I have to say that the director's vision are perfect and I'm glad he got to release his version as it is one of the best films I have seen. Emmanuel Lubezki is a brilliant cinematographer that won 3 Oscars after this film, he should have won it for this one too. It's on the same level as The Revenant, or close to it. The use of natural lightning is his strong point, it's groundbreaking. James Horner musical soundtrack is amazing that fits the times perfectly, it among of other things make The New World into a very immersive film.From what I have read about these events and historical figures, I would say that this adaption is realistic and written with authenticity in mind. It's truly an incredible movie, but the entertainment value isn't very high. The extreme slow pacing can be tiresome, I get that. Your opinion can be different and that's alright, but my opinion is that The New World is a masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,History

There were absolutely no humorous scenes, no romantic scenes, no cute scenes and no scenes with a purpose to contribute to the non-existent story-line.

A rare gem.,"This film is visually stunning, it has amazing cinematography and its portrayal of nature is very well done.

For the most part, the film is extremely beautiful, a great mixture of scenery, music, lighting and romance makes it a gorgeous soul-touching experience.It has very unusual storytelling, it's very straightforward, yet unfamiliar. It doesn't show many things and tells them instead, but at the same time, it likes to skip huge chunks of the timeline.Sadly, its greatness doesn't last forever since it takes some very weird turns.

To clarify that, in this movie - we have 2 civilization that is Britons and Native Indians. While britons so little , the native Indian speak in their own language (Only 5% of it were translated). Its rude for me to put it this way, but it seems that I felt like I was really observing a zoo.I don't understand why there is so little verbal communication in this movie, while as we can see - even ScobbyDoo can talk.There is no real set of problem defined in this movie. The conflict and confrontation of European Colony and Native Indian is poorly unfold. In one scene the European fight with Indian, while in few next scenes - they seems to be friend again. While the war contribute to little part of the movie, much of the movie is spent on observing scenery, human activities, lake, mountain, sun or inaudible conversation which further deviate and deter the movie quality.This movie is my first and biggest disappointment on movie.

I couldn't understand a single word he mumbled, fortunately Pocahontas, for whom English was a second language had no trouble understand every word he said. This is a story rich with any number of angles but this is how Hollywood contemplates it's navel. Terrence Malick is credited with writing the movie script. I wonder what it must have looked like because the story in this movie could be told in a few sentences! And guess what! This movie was also directed by Terrence Malick and since he reduced a great story to a few mumbled lines he filled in all the time with long gazes at sun rises, sunsets, reflections on the water, the landscape, boats sitting in the water, Q'Orianka Kilcher in her native leather and Q'Orianka Kilcher in old English costume. Oh, and Q'Orianka Kilcher just has one expression as well - it's ""I'm concerned, sincere and pretty. And then there are lots of Native Americans who look as though the Hollywood makeup artist had way too much fun with the body paint!",3.0,Anonymous,History
Gripping and Awesome Visual Poetry,"I've been a big fan of Malick going back to the 70s, so I expect certain things from his work. A strong story line with all dots connected is not one of the them. I enjoy the open-ended nature of the story. It goes against the grain of Hollywood films where every little twist of the plot gets smacked against your head. So, freed from the ""constraints"" of a narrative (and, in this case, excessive dialog) the film's strength is a visceral, emotional impact; pure visual wonder, fantastic scenes of things that have never before happened. Has any filmmaker better captured the fear, confusion, apprehension & excitement of the clash of civilizations? It felt unscripted, like anything could happen with the slightest misconstrued gesture or expression. The indians not only looked right, but we get inside of their culture in a way that's more immediate than has been previously depicted. (one part Coppola/Apocalypse + one part Herzog/Aguire + one part National Geographic) Theirs was indeed a paradise ... soon to be lost. One has to have a thick hide not to feel a pang of regret, knowing what was about to happen to them - no matter whether they chose fight or flight. I also loved the use of the two themes from Mozart and Wagner? Brilliant. Too often music gets in the way of the experience.",10.0,Anonymous,History

As Good As Film-making Gets,"Under the current regime of Hollywood film-making, where extreme closeups, staccato editing and short attention spans represent the norm, director Terrence Malick is a throwback to a more sublime era.With ""The New World"" - just his fourth feature release in a career spanning more than 40 years - Malick puts his finely-honed craft on full display, offering a deliberate pacing not seen in many years. For those unaccustomed to such cinematic devices, the small investment of attention required here is richly rewarded.Although the film's time frame spans the historic first 10 years of England's first successful North American colony - the Jamestown settlement, located on what is today's Yorktown peninsula in Virginia - the film is more about the sudden clash of cultures and people thrown together by fate and ambition than it is a mere history lesson.This is not to say, however, that Malick plays fast-and-loose with the actual history of the subject, as is another common custom among epic historical filmmakers. In fact, much of what we know of the Jamestown story as it is recorded in surviving original documentation is represented here, with only a few minor details having been changed or compressed for the purpose of brevity, clarity or plot cohesiveness. Also, the period detail represented here is immaculate, including everything from a full-scale recreation of the original Jamestown fort (or as best it could be, given the limited documentation of the original settlement), to the authentically recreated 17th Century clothing and language.Another impressive feature of ""The New World"" is its depiction of the native Powhatan peoples whom the English first encounter. Great pains were obviously taken to bring this extinct culture back to vibrant life in its dwellings, dress - and language, with the native actors speaking only Algonquin, a form of which the original Powhatans would likely have spoken.And for those looking for the now familiar tale of Pocahontas and John Smith as it relates to Jamestown, this is probably the most accurate portrayal of that story ever depicted in a feature film - but the film as a whole offers so much more than just that well-worn storyline.Those familiar with Malick's earlier films such as ""Days of Heaven"" and ""The Thin Red Line"" will instantly recognize his brilliant, visceral style in ""The New World,"" complete with flowing water, ripples of windswept natural grasses and the ambient sounds of nature included within.Both figuratively and literally, Malick takes the viewer back in time with ""The New World,"" offering an example of classic film-making in its most artistic form, as well as a visual postcard from a long-lost era.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A film of true depth and emotion,"""The New World"" marks the triumphant return of director Terrence Malick, who after a seven year absence, has delivered one of the most impressive films of the past year. Though perhaps too long for his fans, Malick's hiatus was shorter than the 20 years that passed between 1978's ""Days of Heaven"" and 1998's ""The Thin Red Line"". Stylistically, his newest work is more of a continuation of the latter than of his seminal debut, ""Badlands"", and will likely arouse debate among followers of Malick's career. Although it is not very accessible to the average movie-goer, ""The New World"" carries tremendous rewards for viewers in the mood for something artistic.In terms of plot, ""The New World"" is a retelling of the tale of Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher) and John Smith (Colin Farrell). The film begins with the founding of Jamestown and continues through the Smith-Pocahontas relationship, the conflict between the settlers and the Powhatans, and Pocahontas' eventual marriage to John Rolfe (Christian Bale). However, this only scratches the surface of the film's focus.A deeper connection with nature is the unmistakable, driving force of the work. When John Smith first travels to the natives' camp, Malick depicts the Powhatans as a race that exists in harmony with their surroundings. After spending an extensive amount of time with the natives, Smith's return to the English settlement is visually jarring as the palette moves from lush greens to shades of brown. The English outpost is a fort sinking into the mud, confined by looming log walls. Its settlers are contrasted as a group that seeks to shut itself off from nature rather than embrace it. As such, they are unable to thrive in the new world.Pocahontas' eventual journey to England enhances this disparity. One of the film's most effective moments has a Powhatan, Opechancanough (Wes Studi), wandering through London's royal gardens. For him, the topiary designs are an artificial and alien ""forest"", illustrating how man has endeavored to recreate nature despite denying us an authentic experience.However, the film is not just a meditation on the natural world. Malick uses the love story of Pocahontas and Smith to explore the meeting of two very different civilizations. The fact that the title is ""The New World"" is but one indication that Malick has structured his film assuming viewers will automatically begin by identifying with the English. Nevertheless, Malick invests effort to convey the experiences of native life. The sequences he films are effective enough that viewers should find the experiences of the settlers to ultimately be the more foreign of the two.The meetings between the cultures evoke a range of emotions from wonder to fear. Also clear is the immense range of possible outcomes that existed during these first meetings. As the relations between the groups continue to break down, the results are tragic. The relationship between the characters of Smith and Pocahontas represent the idyllic middle ground between the civilizations. Their relationship is a demonstration of understanding that, unfortunately, seems lost on those around them.The film is also successful in its more tangible qualities. The editing is economical, skipping from moment to moment without a traditional set-up and conclusion for each scene. This is not jarring in the MTV sense, but thoughtful, and it allows Malick to include an impressive number of images and emotional moments into the running time. The film's music, scored by James Horner with contributions from Wagner, Mozart, and others, is evocative and complements the on-screen action. It is gratifying in particular that Horner clearly understands Malick's intentions and his serene touches are welcomed.The acting, cinematography, and production design is strong all around. However, newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher deserves special mention in her impressive performance as Pocahontas. Kilcher communicates a maturity well beyond her age (14 at the time of filming) with a youthful energy that brings her character alive. Kilcher eventually becomes the heart of the film and holds the screen well on her own. It is hard to say at this point what future Kilcher may have in other roles, but her performance in this film certainly is notable for its merits.The film has two minor flaws. First, Colin Farrell, in spite of delivering a strong performance, falls victim to ""Last Samurai-itis"" in that he is too recognizable a personality to truly disappear into the character of Smith. Secondly, the voice-overs used throughout the film are at times more pedestrian than insightful and may strike some viewers as pretentious. The strength of the voice-overs is that despite their weakness in content, they fit extremely well into the mood of the film. Combined with the lyrical pacing and editing, the voice overs prove that Malick is a director who can successfully realize poetry in a visual medium. As a result, these flaws do not diminish the emotional impact one feels by the time the end credits roll and to make too much of them would be a disservice to the recommendation that this film carries.Even among the handful of strong releases currently in theaters, ""The New World"" is a must-see. At its core, it is what cinema should be, a visual work of art that succeeds in arousing a strong emotional reaction. Viewers can rejoice over the fact that this film is seeing wide-release and one won't have to search far and wide for an obscure theater in order to experience Malick's vision.

This film is about love,"People who are not interested in the subject of love should not spend their time watching this movie. If you have felt the pain of unreturned love. If you have felt the sorrow of loss. If you found you can love two people, each in a different way. If you went through love as an illness. If you find the path to ourselves can be found in nature. If you are interested in all these topics, and you actually have a ""heart"", then you will not be annoyed by the > two hours of this movie. If not, I think this movie was not shot for you.

For film aficionados only,"I sat through ""Thin Red Line"" and couldn't wait to get out of the theater and get on with my day. In fact, it is one of the few films I've seen in which I had a nearly irresistible urge to walk out on. I saw ""New World"" at Family Video in the 2 for $1 section, and being a lover of historical drama, wanted to give it a shot. I failed to notice, however, that it was directed by Terrence Malick, which is unfortunate since it would have remained on the shelf had I realized.The film is, like Thin Red Line, high art and light substance. It is dreamy, trippy, and filled to overflowing with the internal monologue of the main character. Now that's not in itself a bad situation. However, when the character has almost nothing poignant or interesting to comment on and his delivery is a droning monotone, then the film rapidly becomes a bore.But that, in my opinion is not even the biggest flaw in the movie. The thing that baffles me is why Malick would choose as a backdrop such moments in history as World War II and the English colonization of North America. I suppose that's the point - taking existentialism quite deliberately in contrasting the internal solitude of one man with the terrifying realism of his external environment in very trying times. Still, it seems the same point could have been made in his own home with no name actors instead of in a different time period with A list actors and all the costumes, props, and other challenges involved.I always try to look for some good even in movies I dislike. I can say that the scenery was very beautiful and the time period otherwise seemed well represented with seemingly authentic costumes for both natives and colonists alike. And it did make me think a bit to compile this review. I've read many of the glowing reviews and can appreciate some of the points made.But in the end, I was so bored and otherwise unstimulated that I couldn't finish the movie. I cannot recommend it, and will never see another Malick film again.",3.0,Anonymous,History
a masterpiece,"This film was, in all honesty, not what I expected. I went into the movie theater thinking I would see battles and bravery and adventure, and instead what I found was a sincere and honest portrayal of forbidden love. My heart went out to Pocahontas and her struggle to choose between two men: John Smith, the man she saves from death and thus has an extreme bond to him, and John Rolfe, a kind man who befriends her after Smith is gone. Q'Orianka Kilcher is wonderful in her portrayal of Pocahontas; she can convey a whole rush of emotions without ever speaking. Her face is fresh and curious, and this role could not have been done better. She absolutely steals the show from Colin Farrell (Smith), the supposed star of the film. He does a brilliant job also; his character has immense presence, even though he did not speak very much. I would have liked to see more of Christian Bale,though. His character was kind and generous, but not what you remember from this film. The last scenes in England were the most dramatic- the fog, the grayness, the dull weariness compared to Virginia. Malick is a marvel with his shot selection and the score was very moving.I recommend this to anyone who is tired of seeing the same old Hollywood movie. This is in a class all its own.",9.0,Anonymous,History
1 star for nature tree shots; 0 for no plot montage film that insults Native Americans,"There exists photo of real of Pocahontas & John Smith in North America @ time both lived.

Smith also raped her before she became his property/ guide in new world.Here, This film is pure fiction, the actress is near 17, & def never given title as ""lady"", nor returned to Europe & lived like a ""princess"" , birthing a royal child.I Watched out of curiosity bc of lead casting.

Astonishing,"The lushness of early Virginia, the beauty of an English garden were the two highlights of this film. Smith could have talked some more, that would have livened up this movie. Nevermind. Just the sense of being in Elizabethan (everybody European grew up under her) first colony was impressive. I don't know why some reviewer thought Pocahantas was anti-Christian or anti-European just because she prayed a little bit out the mansion window. She said that the garden was where her deceased mother was and that's deeper.The Indians seemed too over-painted, but I don't know the history of that myself. They looked too much like NFL designs. The surprise of the Indians when the ships arrived was also very well done. It dragged a bit during the middle. Kilcher is a superb actress.

Like a nineteenth century novel, it takes a bit of work to get through it, but the pay-off is worth it.All I can say is that if you liked Badlands or if you liked The Thin Red Line, you'll probably like The New World.

tiresome,"These seems to be a lot of fawning going on in the reviews of The New World. Malick is no sacred cow, and I speak as one who worships his greatness in ""Badlands"", which I saw on it's initial release. I've been a Malick aficionado since then. The reviews here can also seem unpleasantly 'superior' .. as in ""if you don't get this you are cinematically illiterate"" ... This is nasty stuff and points to a similar weakness in the film too - it is overly self-satisfied. My pleasure in watching this was sharing it with my fifteen year old daughter, who has a good eye for subtlety and image. This is a strong point of Malicks too, so I wanted to pair her up with his work. We enjoyed the 'experience' as some reviewers insist on calling it, but the film also tires, and often infuriates with repetitive non-verbal cues. Yes, Terry, we get it, the first time. My impression was the structure was too long on 'art' and too short on narrative. Does this make me a cinematic illiterate?

Opportunities seized and missed,"I knew right away from the trailer that I wanted to see this movie. And the photography and soundtrack (other than the spoken dialog) did not disappoint - they are truly superb. The visuals/aurals of nature are particularly good. The overall effect is stunning. But... I have quite a few quibbles. The dialog, when there is any, is often maddeningly incoherent. The characters seem to be sharing their secrets with just the people in the front row. The continuity is at times strangely non-sequitous. Whether this is intentional or just poor editing I cannot tell. Horner's music is good though there is insufficient original material to get truly excited by it. The inclusion of the Adagio from Mozart's 23rd Piano Concerto is sublime. Even there, though, the timing relative to the action is sometimes a little odd (and entry of the piano a trifle abrupt). Leaving aside any comment on the historical aspects (I'm not qualified to comment), it's hard to know if there is a message we are supposed to take away. The acting is excellent, with the exception of the diction (as mentioned above), particularly if you like to see your heroes looking more goofy than usual. As historical fiction, I was somewhat disappointed. But as a spectacle it is very good. If you're interested at all, I urge you to see it in the movie theater - your DVD player won't do it justice when the time comes. The one opportunity that was grasped firmly and successfully was for the director to be self-indulgent. If you can live with that, then you should definitely go and see it.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"Some thoughts on Malick's ""Indian Princess""","Some may find irony in Terrence Malick's films, but never cynicism. In the New World he hasn't fashioned his version of the events in Virginia 1607 to comply with any prescriptions derived from our zeitgeist for how such historically and ethnically sensitive material should be treated by a non-""Indian"" (the term of self-reference by tribal people, according to Scott Momaday). And, is that even possible? In practice history can never be recovered, ""correctly"" or otherwise, only remade afresh each time for present intent, in which every genuine artist indeed answers a different muse, outside consensus.The New World's storyline is so well-covered by others, that I ask the kind indulgence of readers to allow me a few points of discussion, and mostly notes at that. (Also, there may be SPOILERS.)[ Innocence ] The Indian maiden (her name unspoken) pleads for Captain Smith's life after he's captured and presented by her tribe to her father. He is freed, and despite her father's warning counsel, she is drawn into an arising bond of deep love with Smith through some causal transformation, which has occurred in him as well. They become as two children: there is smiling delight, innocent oblivion, courtesy and respect, silence. There is physical touch, yet no sexual overtones, just tenderness and a becoming shyness, as in a true(r) courtship. She is very young after all. Of this propriety Malick leaves no room for doubt.[ The Other: Singular ] Also evident and striking about their encounter is that its inherent purity is quite something which one would expect to find in such a meeting with the ""Other"" (with what is usually perceived to be completely unlike, foreign, often unwelcome or threatening); that is, when the transforming ability of that encounter is indeed enabled by openness, willingness to accept, and by inborn natural curiosity (when not typically repressed), allowing one to move forward towards that Other. In our world, ""Other"" represents difficult challenges psychologically and emotionally for many people, in coming to terms with accepting much which is foreign, culturally or otherwise. The radical liberation of this central meeting in the film might well shift perspectives for many, at the very least subconsciously.[ The Other: Plural ] Much has been made of the ""betrayal"" by Pocahontas of her people (historically), and being cast out by her father. While that occurs here, Malick's insistence on honoring the importance of individual over collective experience allows him to provide insight: not only are the Indian ""princess"" and Captain Smith able to effect their love for the Other in the singular; it will allow them to further embrace the Other in the plural, as when he intimately bonds with her kin, and when she later enlists those very kinsfolk to bring food and provisions to the English settlers, starving in midwinter. If the underlying dynamic of embracing the Other is clear, it becomes difficult to establish a convincing claim for a pure betrayal on her part. Indeed, she is shown in her continual loyalty as she returns to her father every time she has stepped out of favor while following the inner urgings of her heart, until he sends her away. Could she really choose between her community and Smith? His judgment reestablishes her humility, but it's also importantly on view when she supplicates the spirit of her dead mother who, as becomes apparent, is her true life guide, the only one we see her turning to, before and after this abandonment.[ The Individual ] For Malick there is again an opportunity to show clearly, within the individual/collective context, what is important about the maiden's position. The love for one's parents and community must be deep, yet it comes naturally, without question. However, when love for the Other arises, who can say it may not prove to be the greater, more powerful one? The one that opens, transforms, removes limitations, and matures someone ineffably, and is greater than those involved. Tragically, an opportunity for even a minimal encounter with the Other, between natives and settlers, would be impossible for a long time. However, Malick preempts any manipulation to make us register either ""poor unfortunate naturals"" or ""disgusting new colonials."" Instead he encourages empathy: to see both sides with compassion, to honor every person's suffering. The film appears primarily the story of one individual, the Indian maiden, yet while upholding the singular importance of her experience, Malick enables a deeper insight: that nations, tribes, races, people do not suffer. Only individuals suffer. ""The People,"" (that blind ideological version) never existed, only individuals exist -- sometimes unbearable to see because it is precisely at the level of the individual that one most uncompromisingly confronts the Other.[ Transcendence ] The New World is a transcendent experience, not because of its soul- glimpses (in voice-overs) or nature's endless majesty on view (although its scope, colors and sounds do manifest a different overwhelming sense of Otherness). The movement forward of Rebecca (newly named) through further abandonment by Smith, further surrender as captive Other, further encounter, courtship and marriage to Rolfe, into the blossoming of motherhood: all allow her to know new life at every stage, including her own suffering, from innocent purity and deepening spiritual reliance to the maturity of clear discernment. A last meeting with Smith, a farewell, her final certain embrace of Rolfe... what more is there to know -- for her, or for us?The new world for Smith was not Virginia, nor England for her. It is never the outer, external one. Malick offers this knowledge most intimately, his very invitation to transcendence. His art is genuine in this knowing.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Meandering nature sucks life out of movie,"I have great appreciation for writer/director Terrence Malick's personal philosophy when it comes to film making, having a hard time rating such a sensual director as merely average. The artist's approach at capturing a moment rather then commanding it often times has paid off with sincerely improvised performances and camera-work. However with The New World, this film-making philosophy has unwittingly reared it's pretentious, over-bloated head and seemingly bludgeoned it's powerful themes to death. It is truly a lack of substance in the script that further renders the too many ""busy shots"" shallow in context with a film that failed to keep me interested in the characters with it's meandering, self righteous narration and over zealous score. Malick's direction works best at first, before his thoughtful tone poems turn into gimmick. At the heart of the truth from this movie, there are many lush moments of photographic grandeur to behold of the purity of our earth, and those that strive to live in harmony with it, in part articulated by Kilcher's spiritual performance. As this New World is initially being explored by Farrel and viewer, the obvious reverence for the land Malick tries to induce does shine through, although once this theme is established this exercise feels routine. It is in the developing plot, or lack thereof that the film fails to accentuate it's beautifully shot, stream-of-consciousness homage to the source material. For some reason, Malick's work somehow seems a little too self important for it's own good.",5.0,Anonymous,History

I was distraught emotionally by the story and the powerful, moving narrative. This film is one full of silence, fleeting images, partial sequences, and gorgeously simple moments in time. This is one of the most interestingly edited films because of the juxtaposition of images and the way that the images and earth are allowed to speak for themselves.This film is truly about nature and the voice that it has.Yes, there were moments when I felt that this was a long movie. Yes, there were moments when I was so discouraged by the emotional and physical hardships the characters had to endure that I almost didn't want to continue. But this movie blew me away. It is indescribable in beauty and innocence, and the loss of that innocence is heart wrenching.See it. Feel it. Love it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Ethereal meditation on the birth of a nation and the nature of love.,"Ethereal meditation on the birth of a nation and the nature of love. Beautifully scripted, acted, and shot. Terence Malick is a genius and, selfishly, I wish he'd make more movies. This movie won't make much money and I ask people who like it to support it--tell your friends--and the seemingly endless line of talented people who are eager to work with Malick.World-class actors, producers and other money people, cinematographers and sound people realize his unique talent. Why can't a broader audience? Oh well, if you like this movie and haven't seen THE THIN RED LINE, DAYS OF HEAVEN, or BADLANDS, get the DVDs. Better yet, check for them/request them at your local college, film society, museum or whatever and try to see them on a big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Dances with sheep,"Terrence Malick has made a handful of loose, impressionist films over four decades; 'The New World' is perhaps his most impressionistic yet, but also his most unsatisfactory. It tells the story of Pocohantas, the native American who married an early settler; as in some other tellings of the same tale, he imagines an earlier, competing relationship with the first settler who met and described her. The film attempts to give a flavour of the difficult, confused times faced by settlers and natives which provided the political, social and military backdrop to Pocahantas ultimately being offered to the white man as hostage for the indigenous people's safety. It certainly succeeds in conveying the confusion, because Mallick seems to wilfully disregard every convention of movie storytelling, preferring to give us disjointed scenes from his characters' lives instead of trying to fuse them into a coherent narrative. While one appreciates his desire not to make life appear more linear than it is, the desire for narrative is a natural human one, not just in film audiences but also in people living their own lives; we find stories amid the chaos to make sense of ourselves, and Mallick's failure to do so on behalf of his characters is frustrating. As a love triangle, it doesn't work either, because the two men she falls for are (compared with everyone else in the story) uninterestingly similar; and I never really felt I learnt much about the inner lives of any of the protagonists (Pocohantas, for example, is throughout a picture of serene inscrutability). Ultimately, I didn't understand what Malick was trying to do with this movie; and it's great length left me indifferent and perplexed long before the end.",4.0,Anonymous,History
A slow build up.,"This film is slow in many ways.It is more of a meditation on love and loss.Like his previous powerful epic Thin Red Line,Malick likes to slowly build up his story.The slow pace will distract audience but this is a piece of art that is to be enjoyed and Malick deserves to be praised for what he has achieved.Everyone is familiar with the Pocahontas tale,so I won't go into details.Instead I would like to focus on the direction.Unlike Munich this films length becomes pretentious.It doesn't grow on you but frustrates you.But you have to look beyond that to experience the real treasure hidden underneath.Malick has always focused more on the situation and the settings rather than the characters or the actors.It's more like exploring the world than telling a story about it.Slowly and painfully but beautifully.I enjoyed the film even if it was long and boring because I understood what Malick was trying to do.He wants us to feel for the new world that has been discovered and feel for it when it gets destroyed.I cannot say this is his best work but regardless of that it still is a gorgeous film,a wonderful achievement.An artistic drama that slowly builds up to the end.Farrell is not used as an actor but just as a figure who witnesses the sudden ,devastating changes that happen into this new world.The real actor however is the newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher.She excels in the role,she delivers a heartfelt performance and the director has more focus on this famous character rather than the lead hero.Bale also surprises ,who falls for Pocahontas forming a love triangle.The rest of the cast also have its moment.However the praise should entirely go to the Director.He handles every scene like a king.He presents us this new world with aching beauty and gorgeous sets.He makes the love story between the two leads even more emotional.His slowly building up of story is where audience will lose the film.They will rather find it irritating but if you look closer there's a lot going for it.On the whole THE NEW WORLD is gorgeous epic,a sort of a mess,a heartwarming emotional love story,and a heart stopping epic with not so many noteworthy performances or moments.But a meditated attempt.A film that tries to connect with the audience the hard and painful way ,in which,the reward is priceless.****/5",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Masterpiece!,"I am on my knees thanking the almighty and the film makers for such a wonderful piece of work. It is such a welcome break from the regular, loud, in your face, over the top tag line, poorly acted product that is coming off the Hollywood assembly line these days as regularly as lies out of the white house.This movie is astonishing, it moves with a tranquility and an innocence that I have not seen in long time. It takes it's time, makes you lose yourself in the moment, in the swaying of trees, in the laughter and eyes of lead actress Q'Oriaka Kilcher. Even Collin Farrel, the loud mouthed over the top Alexander that has 'graced' us with his overbearing presence many, too many times, is a revelation in this movie. He is, dare i say it, sympathetic! soft spoken, gentle. Here one can sense what this guy is capable of doing, given the proper DIRECTION. But Q'Orianka Kilcher is simply breathtaking. The freedom with which this 16 year old moves and LIVES in front of the camera will bring you to tears and laughter, all at the same time.I know, how this all sounds, and I know also, that I did not go to the theater to see this movie, but rented the DVD (this is in my opinion due to the poor marketing, or shall I say lack there of which can be attributed to the absence of faith by the studio, that quality is worth a big campaign), but my thirst for a beautiful, not just entertaining, or funny, but a truly BEAUTIFUL movie was finally quenched!

A true piece of art,"""The New World"" is a movie like no other. You cannot look upon it or compare it to just a regular film. It is so much more than that. It is a true piece of art!! Terrence Malick is a genius in film-making an delivers us a truly unique movie-experience in this uncommonly well made movie. He gives us a rare sense of humanity and love and displays naked feelings vividly and honestly to us, letting us feel them ourselves, without the use of worn-out clichÃ©'s. With amazing footage, powerful music and very sharp editing, he manages to say so very many things with the use of so very few words. Outstanding and utterly beautiful! This movie may though not suit everyone. It is extremely special and you need to have a mature viewing-eye and patience, in addition to the ability to give yourself to the story and the experience of it. You have to appreciate movies not just as mere entertainment, but also as the works of arts - sometimes abstractly tilted - they can be. If you open your eyes, sit back, relax and take in the power and majesty, this movie will astound you, letting you leave the room having grown on the rich experience it gives, if you let it.""The New World"" is a wonderful film, that carries with it the segregation of the public, ultimately showing us the true movie-lovers!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Poetic and Impressionistic,"The New WorldCritics were split on the merits of this movie. As of this posting, the movie managed to garner a 54 on Rotten Tomatoes.com. Few people however, seemed to appreciate the poetic essence and impressionistic nature of this film and instead considered it dull and uninteresting.If your a fan of epic historical tales with sweeping sequences of action and intrigue, then this film may disappoint. It is much more an exercise in somber reflection and tacit emotion. Nature and the beauty of an unspoiled land are placed in the forefront, whereas the colonist invaders are held at somewhat of a distance. Pocahantas is decidedly the only character with color and life. If you are a fan of Colin Farrell or Christian Bale, this movie is also for you-they both were beautiful.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Bad poetry,"If you eschew drama for poetry, it had better be good poetry -- and Mallick fails again, despite the beautiful sets and costumes, amounting to lipstick on a pig.I am not adverse to slow-paced, ""poetic"" films -- Kurosawa's Dreams, and The Fast Runner (Atarnajut), for instance, are glacially paced, but beautiful, intriguing films.I turned on the subtitles (in the extended cut DVD) to read some of the barely audible voice-over whisperings of the characters' internal thoughts -- godawful trite dreck, like a 6th-grader's musings.Mallilck needs to hire a real writer/poet to make this novelistic technique work. And cut back on the repetitious scenes of Pocahontas worshipfully twirling around in the grass like a stoned hippy chick, while the overbearing music score manages to be both annoying and monotonous.I feel sorry for viewers seduced into thinking this unstructured, meandering, undramatic film is profoundly avant-garde and bohemian while they struggle to keep from snoring.",2.0,Anonymous,History
A Different Kind of Love Story,"I saw this and Tristan and Isolde in the same sitting and was delighted to find that both told very different love stories than what I, at least, am used to seeing in theaters these days, nor were they same story as one another. It's a love story that challenges you instead of just leaving you warm and snug.Be prepared to dig in and buy in to an immersing experience. The film is long and even slow at times. It is intentional in its pacing, not haphazard. There were themes of being in a place, of experiencing a place and of waiting that some people may find frustrating. But I'd say the experience is one worth having. It is also the kind of movie, like Master and Commander, that you may not find to have a neat, satisfying ending. This is not a neatly gift-wrapped package, it is, at least in part, a true story with the complications that brings; it feels like a segment of the time-line cut out and rolled out for you to explore rather than a story constructed to fit neatly into a one paragraph synopsis.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Pearl Harbor in Jamestown,"I usually don't write reviews on here but I felt compelled to in this case. I know this movie came out ages ago but this was my first watch.The good: being fair, this movie is not entirely awful. Some truly great shots Are shown here of the American wilderness. I mean truly enchanting stuff. Phenomenal cinematography throughout the movie, it truly is art. The score is great as well. The filmmaker deserves all the credit for this.The bad: the pace is unfathomably slow. Like 100% not defendable. First 20 minutes or so are interesting. Then an hour of Collin firth and Pocahontas giggling like schoolgirls, jumping off logs in the woods and stuff. Like we get it dude they're in love... we all know the story. Then a pretty cool fight scene, another 30 minutes or so of wilderness puppy love frolicking, then Christian bale shows up when the movies essentially over. I don't think any of the actors gave a bad performance but they literally had nothing to do. The most apt comparison I can give for this movie is Pearl Harbor, but set in the founding of Jamestown. Just kinda focuses on their quasi-love triangle, instead of the founding of Jamestown. The move has interesting parts, the settlers struggle against wilderness is interesting, but every time the movie starts to garner steam it's quickly doused by more frolicking in the woods with Pocahontas whispering. I know people are gonna say ""you don't get it."" I totally got it, it's pretentious, not as deep as it wants you to think it is.Seriously though some stunning shots of the American wilderness and countryside between the bad, truly enthralling stuff at times. Overall a lame movie honestly. Could easily cut an entire hour out and lose nothing plot wise, time that could've been spent livening things up a little.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"Beautiful, Powerful, Unexpected","I saw it last Tuesday night, after a hectic, long and stressful day where all I hoped for was some mindless entertainment. It was not a movie I would have chosen, but a couple of friends suggested it. What it turned out to be was totally unexpected.It has Colin Farrell, Christian Bale, and a girl named Q'Orianka Kilcher who was only 14 when this movie is made and totally blows me away with her depth and grace. The story is another telling of Pocahontas and John Smith, with a new character (historically accurate, I think), John Rolfe (Christian Bale). What is so surprising about this movie - over 2 hours long - is that there is more dialog in a half-hour sitcom than in this movie. But I came away from it more moved and touched - not in a darling, maternal way but in a truly changed, effected way - than I have from any movie that I can think of. Farrell, Bale, and this incredible girl were so utterly convincing in their facial expressions, gestures, and other silent communications - in addition to some dialog and voice-overs, of course, it's not a silent film :o) - that I was deeply drawn in and find that it still is affecting me today. I'd want you to know going into it that it is far from a conventional film so if you're like me you might squirm through the first while as your expectations get shifted.

"A rewarding and humbling experience that the audience has to work for, rather than just sit back and watch.","If you are going to see The New World, be prepared to have to pay close attention and keep an open mind. For the fist half an hour I was immensely frustrated, both with the rambling editing and seemingly out-of-place music, but once I realised that what I was seeing was not a standard dialogue and scene-driven drama, but an exploration of love, colonisation and nature at its best. Once you surrender yourself to the jagged style and that every second of a scene might be the last and that many of them don't last more than two shots, you appreciate every little detail and cherish every word. This is not a film, this is a private video of a part of history, and you are invited to follow these characters around, privy to their most intimate moments. Seeing such touchingly realistic acting, I was amazed at how staged and stylised scripts have become, and how this director seemed to say so much with so little words. I was so refreshed after seeing this movie that I felt like running off into the wilderness and escaping the constraints of society forever. So much is crammed in to every minute that it seemed a bit hap-hazard; sort of a two and a half hour long trailer. It is not so much a slow pace that bores many viewers (the man in front of me left halfway through) but the need for them to expect nothing more than what they are shown. In other words, do not expect to be handed character motives and themes on a plate. My only grievance is that on its second night in West Australian cinemas, it was only given three sessions a day, as opposed to Mission Impossible 3's twelve.

A Different Look,"It is hard to go anywhere in this country without seeing the effects of western civilization on the landscape of the world. Cities are reaching higher and higher into the sky. Areas once populated with trees and streams are now occupied by housing complexes and mini-malls. The land once known as the ""new world"" is fading.Terrence Malick's (The Thin Red Line, Badlands) The New World focuses on the first encounter between the white man and the Native Americans. Captain Christopher Newport (Christopher Plummer, The Insider) leads a group of men with the help of the sometimes troublesome Captain John Smith (Clin Farrell, Phone Booth) and a host of other Englishmen as they try and establish a colony in this ""new world"".The natives, upon seeing these massive ships pouring out strange men in funny costumes, are started and intrigued. Chief Powhatan has many wives and many daughters. Pocahontas is, by far, his favorite daughter. Newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher is dazzling as the energetic, free spirited native.After setting up a fort like encampment, Smith and others go out in search of the native's camp. Smith finds himself surrounded by a large group of natives and they overpower him. He is taken back to their Chief who has the final say in what will be done to Smith. In a very ceremonious motion, Pocahontas persuades her father to spare his life and let her find out the ways of his people.For a long time, Smith and Pocahontas teach each other who their people really are by learning the others language. The first session between the two is one of the many intimate and tasteful scenes in the movie.The movie itself is a historical retelling of the events that occurred in Jamestown in the 17the century. The movie is practically void of dialogue and tends to focus more on the emotions of its characters. Malick does, however, incorporate character narration, which gives us an interesting look into what they are feeling. The movie is, in some ways, a collection of journal entries by Smith, Pocahontas, and John Rolfe (Christian Bale, Batman Begins) come-to-life.Kilcher was about 14 years old when the movie was made. Some of the intimate scenes are very passionate, but tame for today's moviegoers. She shows a lot of potential for the future. Along with Kilcher is a very different Farrell. He gives his best performance since Tigerland (2000).Malick's work with the camera is impressive. Nature seems to co-exists with the characters and interacts with them. It is incredibly surreal at times. James Horner's (A Beautiful Mind, Titanic) beautiful score enhances this effect.Nominated for an Academy Award in Best Cinematography, The New World is not your typical film. The battle scenes are tastefully done as so every member of the audience can refrain from covering their eyes. Overall, the movie is well made, well-acted, and is an interesting look at an important historical event.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Malick or no-Malick?,"Are you the type of person who would be interested in a Terrance Malick film? That is the foremost question you should ask yourself before going to the theater and spending box office prices. Do NOT think about the fact that Colin Farrell or Christian Bale are in this film before you spend your hard earned money. I would suggest you rent one of Malick's previous films. If you can sit through one of his movies, then you may have a taste for what he puts upon the screen. If you cannot sit through his films, then you have saved yourself a lot of money. Malick is for those who want to sit at a art exhibit and stare at a red dot like the dot was an original piece of art. Malick's work is for those who patrol art exhibitions by artists who make things out of garbage so they can ""fit in"" with high society. Malick is popular with the Hollywood liberals--that should explain enough right there. It is him personality that makes him popular over his talent. Malick is NOT a good film maker. His audiences are small because his talent is limited. Malick spends more time trying to convey messages with LONG shots of grass, trees, birds, bushes, etc because his dialog cannot bring out the essence of the film itself. Malick cannot bring the better performances out of his actors that would create the same atmosphere (but better) that he tries to create with his terrific direction. Malick is not in the same league with the great directors of our time: William Wyler, Steven Spielburg, Clint Eastwood, etc. Men who can focus on an actor's eyes for the perfect emotion, men who can tell a story without focusing on a blade of grass, and men who can make three hour movies and maintain a proper flow of visuals and dialog. Rent The Thin Red Line, Heaven's Gate, or Badlands (all in the worse 100 movies of all time) and if you can sit through any of them; you are ready for Malick.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Awe: The Quiet Curiosity and Fear When Worlds First Meet,"Terrence Malick is a master of understatement and it is that quality of his writing and directing that makes THE NEW WORLD so luminous an experience for the viewer. Though the historical material in this film has been told and written and filmed to exhaustion, Malick finds that awe and wonder as the Old World of the King James' England puts ashore on the pure and unsoiled land of Virginia of 1607 to an audience of naively innocent 'naturals' who are as fascinated with the arrivals of the visitors as the English are curious yet fearful of the 'savages' they may face in this new place. This is an interior film that just happens to be filmed in the wonders of the meadows and rivers and seaside of nature resplendent.Malick has wisely elected to have the meeting between the naturals and the English remain in their own languages: the Indians speak a beautiful language that is not translated for the audience, a fact that adds to the feeling of 'the other' on both sides. And it is this separateness that makes the story credible. Upon landing Captain Newport (Christopher Plummer) cancels the scheduled hanging of Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell) and sets rules for the newly formed Jamestown, which he soon leaves to return to England, leaving Captain Smith in charge. It is Smith's duty to meet with the naturals in an attempt to gain needed food supplies. The magic that occurs with this meeting of 'the stranger' with the naturals is the epitome of discovery. Smith is saved from execution by the Chief Powhatan's (August Schellenberg) favored daughter Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher) and lives with the naturals, learning their innocence of spirit and falling in love with Pocahontas.But Smith is returned to his fort, suffers misadventures among his own men, sustains attacks by the disenchanted naturals, and eventually returns to England, telling his friend to inform Pocahontas that he has drowned. Pocahontas is outcast from her community because of her kindness to the English and is placed in Jamestown where she is 'assimilated' by the new arrival of English. Among the new arrivals is John Rolfe (Christian Bale) who falls in love with Pocahontas and though she does not love Rolfe she consents to the arranged marriage because Rolfe is kind and because she believes her beloved Smith to be dead. The two have a child and Rolfe takes his little family to England where Pocahontas is presented at court for her invaluable aid to the English. She discovers Smith is still alive, dies, and Rolfe and son return to Jamestown. No spoilers, these: this is historically accurate reporting of stories we have all known from grade school.All of this majestic story is told primarily in silence with the stream of conscious dialogue from each character spoken in voice over. The sounds of nature accompany the action in an eerily perfect manner. Many have praised James Horner's musical score for this film and it is a score that contributes to the beauty of the film: the fact is there is little original music here, the use of Wagner's 'Das Rheingold' accompanies the extended opening and recurs for the big moments while Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 23 is used extensively for the quiet moments. Yes, it works, but there is not much other original music to praise.But that is the only quibble with those who have raved about this film. It does weave its spell under Malick's understanding eye and is beautifully cast with first-rate actors who are asked to render their characters physically and with their eyes rather than words. Farrell, Kilcher, Bale, Thewlis, Plummer and the large supporting cast are exemplary. What, then, Malick has given us in this majestic film is that sense of wonder of the unknown, the thin thread between curiosity and threat that spins the coming together of cultures. And that sense of awe is still propelling the forces of the world today. If only all such interactions would hold the respect of this initial encounter. Highly recommended.

You flow through me like a river.""The New World at its heart is the tale of an exceptional young woman and a legend in American mythology. The curious pondering of her existence in harmony with earth, sea and sky is profound and spiritual. ""You are our Mother. We rise out of the soul of you."" Oddly, her name (Pocahontas) is never spoken. The film reveals her idyllic world at the point of European discovery and she becomes a metaphor for paradise corrupted. The use of first person narrative with breathtaking visual montage is extraordinary: The river below mirrors an endless swath of migratory birds in flight, then, in the throws of new love she stands at the waters edge as a bolt of lightning pierces the twilight. Tension builds between rival factions as a sliver of moon appears long enough to reveal what is actually an eclipse, followed by an empty canoe, adrift, a fire burning at its center, preceding her despair and the carnage of battle. . A rough spot or two in the editing simply reveals the filmmakers endless tinkering. Once again Terrance Malick has created an operatic work of nearly unbearable beauty.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Malick and Meditation,"How Terrance Malik began life as a director of a movie like Dirty Harry and developed into the director of The New World must be a fascinating story. Some directors don't grow (thinking Spielberg) so to me they cannot be artists. Malik is an artist, a genius in the art of film, totally underrated and ignored by Hollywooden, as are all the true greats. This movie is a meditation on love, war, and conquest. It could be Buddhist, it could be Hindu, it could even be Scientology; but its essence is that of the meditation. It floats though the eyes into the mind and into the spirit. I too love this movie - when I watched ""The Thin Red Line"", I couldn't believe I was watching a war movie. That ""war"" movie attuned me to the environmental devastation that was is - in 60's language, ""it raised my consciousness"". I had already hated war, but Malik helped me analyse why. Now Malik attunes me to the conquest of this mystic land. I like far in the north, with many, many trees.

A 'must see' for anyone who appreciates filmmaker Terrence Malick's work - a cinematic feast and celebration of humanity through the legend of Pocahontas,"""The New World"" is an epic tale, of a young girl's wide-eyed experience of first love, of a family tribe's struggles vs. explorers' conquering fares, of a woman growing up through learning to cope with difficulties/loss, helpless violence/war, loneliness/solitude, tenaciously keeping kindness in her heart in spite of it all. Malick's vision is essentially realized by an extraordinary debut performance from Q'Orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas. It's an indisputably 'Tour De Force' Kilcher, carrying the whole film from beginning to end (135 minutes of it), beyond Colin Farrell's role of Captain John Smith, to acting along side with the ever subtle strength of (""Batman Begins"") Christian Bale as Englishman John Rolfe, who became Pocahontas' dear husband and father to her child.The film is not a family movie even though 'Pocahontas' sounded Disney. This is about the historical legend of Pocahontas, how the Princess of the New World came to be. Malick uses his unique style: there are quiet deliveries of thoughts spoken (though at times, we the audience can't hear too clearly as the words were so 'silently' uttered) - we are observers to the characters, events, scenes presented on screen - poetic in its own way. Mind you there is substance, the story told is full of details and information for the taking (even though narrative seems minimal). It is a rewarding 'filmic' experience not to be rushed but gently absorbed. In spite of the harsh scenes and seeming violence, it is very much a story about humanity, of one amazing woman's contribution to mankind.Having passed through Cape Horn and scenes of Ushuaia, I especially appreciate the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki of the natural beauty of the sky, land and waters - the light and hues do seem 'out of this world'. James Horner provided the complementary score. There are approaches reminiscent of Malick's previous film, ""Days of Heaven"" 1978, with Richard Gere, Brook Adams and Sam Shepard. Cinematographers Nestor Almendros and Haskell Wexler delivered remarkable natural light scenes with Ennio Morricone's integral score to perfection.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An extraordinary filmic experience.,"We know enough about British adventurer-explorer John Smith (who later named the region where I now live, New England) one of central figures in the Jamestown Colony of Virginia to understand how Terrence ""Sparky"" Malick was inspired to write and direct this movie. It follows the story of how Captain John Smith, then 26 (in 1606) was captured by the aboriginal people of Virginia and whose life was saved by the chieftain's preteen daughter. Pocahontas.Malick is not a light-weight filmmaker (DAYS OF HEAVEN, THE THIN RED LINE) but he is an indulgent one. THE NEW WORLD is a meditative Tone Poem (yes, I know, this nomenclature belongs to music) the only appropriate term that comes to mind. It has polarized critics and audiences as well.The film really belongs to an earlier period perhaps before the invention of television. It has been called ""elegiac"" by some critics who have swooned over it. I tend to agree. It is all at once, the aforementioned symphonic poem, a composition in one movement and a tender, crushingly moving love story that touches its audience deeply but does not leave marks. The nature of true love and life is both observed and reflected upon. The background tableau is essentially the natural world preexisting the European intrusion into the Western Hemisphere. In this environment Malick has been able to simplify the phenomenon of love and examine it in a wonderful light.If I were a critic I would say that the film can use some cutting. We revisit Malick's pastoral visions more than once too many times. All that said, this is a very unusual experience in film. Its photography is magnificent and the music score exquisite. Perhaps it's one that we badly need in this our day of overwhelmingly chaotic, rapid-fire, synthetic life. Highly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Forget a second look...not worth a first.,"This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. Maybe that's because I was expecting a historical action movie (like The Patriot or Braveheart). This turned out to be more like one of those bizarre Estee Lauder commercials.Over 60% of the movie is in voice overs. A typical scene from the movie has the couple (Ferrell/Kilcher or Bale/Kilcher) running/working in an open field asking questions like ""Where are you my love?"" or ""How will I know if you love me?"" Even for an romantic film it was crappy. The remainder of the movie that is not voiced over is whispered, spoken with thick accents, or in Native American dialects (with no subtitles) that make it nearly impossible to hear. One of the few American films that actually should have had subtitles.The film was so weird that when it ended no one in the theater said a word. Usually there is some chatter/discussion while exiting. Not here. Everyone just got up and left quietly. It was like leaving a funeral home.Bottom line -- don't waste your money or time unless you're punishing yourself for something.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Q'Orianka Kelcher is a phenomenon,"Hers was the most powerful performance I've seen in a good, good long time. She can more clearly state what her character is thinking using her eyes and face than if she had actually spoken. I am dumbstruck that this was a 14 year old girl in her first major production; My only regret is that it is unlikely to see her execute such a mature, and subtle role. Instead of Christian Bale (who also made a believer out of me with this film), to see her opposite a lesser leading man in a blockbuster with explosions and car chases would offend me deeply. This movie fulfilled the contract with the viewer that says if you just willfully suspend your disbelief for a bit, I will take you somewhere or somewhen you've never been. Q'Orianka was largely responsible for that. This movie blew me away, and I hope to see this amazing actress again soon in a worthy role. Perhaps the next Fast and Furious?",9.0,Anonymous,History
Rafel Film Center Preview 142 minutes of bliss!,"I didn't see the version that opened on Christmas in LA + NYC. The print I saw on Sunday Jan 8, 2006 ran 142 minutes by my watch. A lot of people had to get up and use the restroom but all of them came back. I found the movie ravishing in it's deep and mysterious beauty. This is not just pictorial attractiveness (like MEMOIRS OF A GEISHA) but a splendid meditation which gives grown up people a chance to reflect on their own loves, lives, choices and gives them room to have their own feelings if they are so inclined. It's a novel experience these days when most films badger, cajole and manipulate shamelessly to less effect. This is a surprising and delicious movie FOR GROWN UPS. Of course, I wish I could see it at only private screenings and an intermission would be nice in any movie over 2 hours. These are minor considerations. I will be seeing this film several times in the theatre. I hope the audiences will be quiet! There is no bass hum to let you know when things are getting exciting and the film itself is rather quiet. p.s.As with the AWFUL ""Titanic""- Any young man smart enough to take his romantically inclined sweetheart to this film will be very lucky indeed!

Wow.......this will put you to sleep.,"Terrible. The movie was so slow. The whole time there is an almost annoying sound in the music. It's like a trumpet that is to loud and only has one pitch. It plays over and over again. Also there are to many scenes were the actors are just running around in the grass looking at each other. It will drive you insane because they will stare and stare at each other but no one will talk. They just stare. I must say that with the talent of his actors Malick failed as a director. This movie is to flat. The trailer made it look like an action adventure when it is more like a documentary on the nature channel. Please save you money and the two and half hours of your life. Anyone who finds this movie entertaining has very low standards for a good movie. This is not a good movie, almost like ""Alexander"" without the action. Do not see it.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"""The New World"" is a marvelous film built on reflective images through both its cinematography and narration.","The story of Pocahontas and her relationship with John Smith has long been renowned in early American history. The common misconception is that she and Smith were lovers. This notion has been played upon in literature and even popular family entertainment such as Disney's 1995 movie, ""Pocahontas."" Terrence Malick's new film, ""The New World"" takes that road, as well. However,it never becomes a sexual relationship; at least not that we ever see.The characters at most share a kiss from time and time and admit they love one another. The film's producer, Sarah Green, defends this by implying that the filmmakers wanted to maintain an element where the film combines the actual history with the mythology of Pocahontas' life. The implied love between Smith and Pocahontas is highly effective in telling the story. The love story is what drives her to help the colonials and to persuade her future choices to marry Rolfe and go to England. In the end, we see a woman who is more than a lover and a diplomat, but a truly courageous and open minded individual who bridged the cultural gap between nations.The basic facts are known about PocahontasÂ—she and Smith were friends and she helped the Jamestown colony by providing food during the harsh winter. But ""The New World"" goes beyond the fundamentals and delivers her entire life. Smith eventually is sent back to England on an expedition to the Northern American lands for the King. Pocahontas is eventually captured by the colonials as leverage between the then warring English and as the films refers to, Naturals (Natives). During that time, Pocahontas assimilates into the English culture through style of dress and the like, while never forgetting her past. She eventually meets John Rolfe, marries him and has a son. They go to England where she is received by the King and Queen and are treated as royalty. She eventually dies of disease.What separates this film from being a documentary is how it is crafted. ""The New World"" is a film built on reflective images through both its cinematography and narration. The cinematography often focuses on the wind in the trees, the flowing of water, the changing of the seasons, sunrises and sunsets. Not at any time does this film succumb to being a common entertainmentÂ—it is not built on useless action scenes or unnecessary violence. Nor does it pursue any sexual element between either love stories involving Pocahontas with Smith or Rolfe. After all, when she met Smith, Pocahontas was no more than 14 years old.Still the film is glorious to observe. Its narration, perhaps the poetry of a journal or the ramblings of characters in their elder years, brings an evocative feel to the picture. It is as if director Malick wants the audience to feel the passage of time as the characters did. Moreover, the film asks us to slow down and appreciate elements of nature before a time when development would take over these lands. We are immersed in shots of the forests, the rivers that lead to the ocean and of the sandy beaches of the Virginia coastline. Combined with the musical score of composer James Horner, this being the finest score he has produced since ""A Beautiful Mind,"" the film takes on a form of escapism like no other film of 2005.Pocahontas is played by newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher in a very fine performance. She plays the young princess with subtlety showing the free-spirited antics of a young woman combined with a maturity beyond her years.Colin Farrell plays Smith with finesse. He represents the famed British soldier with a warrior's drive combined with the mind of appreciation for the new world he is discovering. In other scenes, he portrays the care he feels for Pocahontas through expressionism. In one particular scene, he comes to the realization that any pursuit of a future with Pocahontas is out of the question. We see his eyes well up and his somber countenance evoking a deeper, inner sorrow.Even more credit needs to be given to Christopher Plummer's short performance of the leader of the English crew at the film's beginning. Plummer has a presence of authority that few actors command. His constant dignified look and manners or speech represent not only those of a refined character, but of a refined actor. Also, Christian Bale is terrific as Rolfe. His love for the native princess is disheartened by her grief over loosing Smith and leaving her people. But the character never becomes enraged or jealous of SmithÂ—he is a gentleman and will not be reduced to that level. He loves her and understands that her relationship with Smith was something that he could not be. Bale portrays this performance with the class of veteran actors like Michael Caine. Incidentally, Bale played a voice in Disney's 1995 ""Pocahontas"" as one of the English settlers.The very title signifies more than the new world that the English found. It represents the new world that the native princess would find herself in, and every new world that she would encounter on the road of her short, yet amazing life.I have always noted that film is an expression of life. ""The New World"" is a film that expresses a different kind of life, in a different time amongst diverse individuals. Regardless of whether or not an intimate relationship existed between Smith and Pocahontas is a myth that is disputed by countless historians. But in this case, I do not care. This film is so effective through the subtlety of its storytelling, cinematography, performance, musical score and direction that it transcends the simplicity of the term 'history' to become 'legend.' What a marvelous film!",10.0,Anonymous,History
pure torture,"As I was driving home I was trying to remember the last time I had sat through a movie as boring and annoying as the one I had just seen. And The Thin Red Line came to mind. I got home and looked it up and sure enough same director. I remembered sitting in the theater looking at my watch every 10 minutes wondering when will this torture end. If you liked The Thin Red Line you will love this movie. Plenty of sun shining through trees, plenty of mindless walking around. Natives walking through the fields, colonists walking through the fields, natives walking through the forest, then colonists walking through the forest, voice overs here and there, natives running around , colonists walking again, natives walking again, a battle where many colonists die and yet their numbers don't diminish, more walking, more voice overs, a boat ride, more walking, a conversation, more walking, more sunlight, oh beautiful nature, more walking...get the idea. Towards the end I was laughing at the sheer ridiculousness of sitting in a theater being tortured to death. Every time Christian Bale came on I was hoping he would say "" I am Batman "". Then I would have known for certain that I was watching a comedy.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Meaningful tale beautifully told,"John Smith was a real soldier, adventurer and colonist. Pocahontas was a favoured daughter of a local important Powhatan chieftain. She was a young teenager when they met and it is reliably recorded that her interventions aided the colonists as they tried to survive an early tough winter. Much else about the story has been embellished in comic books and the Disney cartoon. Terence Mallick takes the elements of the story that are believed to be true to give substance his excellent exploration of the contact between two contrasting societies with very different needs and interests. Yet this compelling film is not primarily a history. It is a meditation presented through beautiful imagery offset by savagery and stupidity. Colin Farrell manages to capture the enigmatic Smith with his genuine wonder about this new world. In one scene he proceeds up a river on his own looking like something escaped from the Tower of London, for he wears a metal helm and body armor as he wades through a river. He is of course completely vulnerable and either very foolhardy or extremely brave. He is easily captured and shortly after we see the well known, but possibly fictitious, life-saving intervention of Pocahontas. Q'orianka Kilcher is a most convincing Pocahontas, deftly combining child-like awe at the beauties of the world around her and great spirit when it comes to dealing with Smith and the somewhat gross colonists. The film has a dreamlike quality in parts that is reminiscent of Tarkovsky, who delighted in slow explorations of water and the beauties of the natural world. For each society, the 'Naturals' as they are described, and the Colonists, the others are so beyond understanding that they might as well be from a dream. It is this dreamlike quality that pervades the whole film. Perhaps the abrupt editing and the way the story is presented in chunks with very spare dialogue may be too stylised for some. It worked for me, as did the musical score which is a counterpoint to the imagery. This is a film to watch when you have time to become really absorbed. It is not a film to miss.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Spectacular Poetic film,"I can not understand and other rating but a 10 for this film. Why? Because it didn't contain a lot of unnecessary drivel, extraneous blabber and gratuitous violence and sex? This film made me weep from the poetic and graceful depiction of the worst and best of human nature. The visual narration evokes deep emotion. Few film makers and actors can achieve such a sensory blast with music, visual, poetry and acting with little dialogue. I commend Sir Malik and the great actors who were able to transform themselves so eloquently to tell a story so moving and profound in a world where a story like this is usually told in everything this film was not. It was sensitive and touching and artistic. Something we seem to be losing.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Small Voice for Historical Context,"Any film is ultimately laced with the subjective desires of the director. And there has already been several reviews of The New World as a triumph of Malick's view of primitive America--and that the viewer should simply accept it as that. Being a big fan of Malick's Days of Heaven as one of the really great visual movies, I for one revel when somebody dips into history as movie subject matter and gives it the visual treatment it deserves to pull the viewer into the story. There is great visual worth to NW. But I also want to see the context upheld. If Malick was true to his subjectivity, he should have had enough objectivity to do the film either with veiled fictitious names--a typical Hollywood technique--or been more honest with the historical characters to protect the innocent--in this case both Captain John Smith and Pocahontas.He is wrong-headed about Smith--and it is probably to fit the scripted character to bad boy Colin Farrell that he commits this mortal sin of historical context! Smith was a seasoned military man--that little-boy-lost look of Farrell's doesn't make it! Smith had sustained many a close call, including ship wreck and many battles; he was severely wounded and subsequently sold into slavery; he beat to death his brutal Turkish owner and escaped far northeastern Turkey to return to Europe. He was contracted as a responsible military leader of the Jamestown colony, and he was extremely single-minded in this--though saddled with a wimpy, selfish colonial leadership that caused him to go over the line when called for. Smith was much more black and white than the colorful rebel Malick wishes to paint him as with Farrell as his brush. It is the old Hollywood story of infusing modern character to historical figures, and it will continue to be that way to sell tickets. But climbing inside a 16th-17th century mind reveals people often very alien to modern living--and that is a story too. Smith was unusual even for his time. His drive in life was adventure and quick action and the advancement he could collect. In and out of close calls so often, he probably had no time for sex!--indeed he seems to have been rather indifferent--a monk of war--rather asexual even----he never even married--and that is strange indeed for those times.On the other hand, there is Pocahontas--one of the truly unique people of American history--not only thoroughly engrossed with the invading European culture but with an adult's pathos to aid the inept Jamestown colonists. It should be made very plain that she was only ten years old at the time she met Smith in 1607--he was and always was known to her and in her own words as ""Father"". And as a little girl of incredible ability she had much more to do in trying to help and warn Jamestown than as she is depicted--a fifteen year old high school girl in primeval languor succumbing to hot and heavy Colin Farrell. If that isn't a slice of today's internet and e-mail soft porn pandering to the fantasies of middle-aged men (but, of course, back in the old days girls were married off as per-teens--so its alright?)! Hollywood has always beaten history into its own image with the one dictum always ever most--fill the seats--sex, violence, controversy drive the movie industry--the audience isn't interested in accuracy. Very true--but another epic love story of lust that was not?--come on!--how about a true story of unselfish love--too bad the idea that history can be more than fiction isn't tried more often!",5.0,Anonymous,History

Save yourself the money,"The movie starts with the possibility of going somewhere, but dies soon after. Terrible dialog, too long, and Colin just can't carry the writing which is bad in itself. The voice over narratives are annoying and you just want to hit the stop button, but all else is silent except for the cheesy porn sounding music that pipes in periodically when Pochahanta and Jon Smith are in touching scenes together. This film tries to be poignant and artsy, but falls way short. Christian Bale is the only believable character in the film and unfortunately he is only in it for the last 20 minutes. I suppose the lack of dialog could be defended by saying that they spoke 2 different languages, but Pochahantas sure learned fast.

excellent movie,"history,love,passion,nature,culture,drama,all in one package. This movie was truly emotionally moving for those who would understand it. People who don't understand the true meaning of this movie its because they haven't lived it yet, but once they do they will appreciate it. Well, even thought it has different topics, the main one its love, its a historical love story that never dies. Everyone interprets this movie in different ways, the way I perceived it was that pocahontas had two man in her life, the one she loved and the one she appreciated. The one who awaken her innocence with passion and the one who made her a submissive common woman(wife,mother). Both men loved her and somehow she loved them too, but in different ways. Pocahontas never let go of her first love which it was captain smith, she may have gone insane for losing her true love at some point in time, but she faced reality by facing john smith at the end of the movie, she knew things weren't going to work out but she kept loving him until the end, the beautiful thing is that she was honest of how she felt about love with her husband john rolfe and he understood, because he loved her. Some people complain of how little wording was used in this movie, well the thing is that wording was not necessary, expressions says it all.

New World,"Historically this movie is a farce. The inaccuracies are so many and blatant that I find myself stunned in disbelief. No one in this movie thought of reading a history book on the settlement of Jamestown. Pocahontas and Smith never had a love affair. She was a 12 or 13 year old beautiful girl fascinated and infatuated with the John Smith and English settlers. It is a myth that Smith had a relationship with Pocahontas. Even the last scene of Rolfe, who Pocahontas did marry, carrying his child on board to head for the New World was wrong. Rolfe abandon the child in England never seeing him again. Now it not bad enough the movie is historically inaccurate but after 15 minutes of beautiful cinematography the show turns into a BORE.

Cinematic Poetry,"Terrence Malick, the director of The New World, is known for not rushing his projects and concentrating on the quality and the details. As a result he has directed only four motion pictures over his 30-year career but each one of them has with time gathered a loyal and strong following.Starring Colin Farrell (Phone Booth, Alexander), Christian Bale (Equilibrium) and the young actress Q'Orianka Kilcher, The New World tells the well-known story of Pocahontas. British settlers arrive in Virginia to establish a colony called Jamestown. Relatively soon they run into troubles with their food supplies and the natives and decide to send Captain Smith to a nearby village to try to negotiate a trade agreement. While in the village Smith and the youngest daughter of the chief, Pocahontas, fall in love despite the chief's caveat. Soon after Smith's return to Jamestown, he is sent on a faraway mission, leaving Pocahontas alone. After a while John Rolfe arrives and also falls in love with her. In the end Q'Orianka, as well as the viewer, is torn between the loves of these two equally respectable men.Everything about The New World is extraordinary. One can see that it was filmed with great passion, dedication and pure artistic interest. The direction of the movie is not completely clear and unambiguous. Some short parts of the otherwise continuous script are skipped and replaced with genuinely alluring shots of nature. The actors' first-rate performances reinforced with the aesthetic direction, careful editing and the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki (Children of Men, Y Tu MamÃ¡ TambiÃ©n) truly bring the characters to life and you feel their emotions as well as your own. Parts of the film are narrated by the three leads. The narration differs from conventional in such that it does not work as a plot device but rather comprises deep and profound dictums describing the characters' emotional state. One of the greatest technical achievements of this film is that contrary to other films, in which the music is edited to fit the scenes, the music was mixed first and then the scenes were cut to fit the score. The soundtrack is mostly classical music including the ingenious ""Das Rheingold"" by Richard Wagner. The scenery is mostly pure untouched nature but they also built a copy of Jamestown, canoes, natives' shacks and a lot of other props; all real and out of authentic material. This goes to show just how much affection and love was put into The New World.Audiences and critics are much divided by this film. This is most likely because The New World requires a lot of attention and if you are not used to sitting in a chair staring intensely at the screen for more than two hours you will not get much out of it. The New World may have not received the Academy Award it deserved nor was it a big hit at the box office but everyone involved in making of this film should be proud for they have proved that motion pictures can be art too.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Amazing way of expressing the creation of the so called 'New World' and 'new World Order',"Those who expected to watch a typical American movie may have been disappointed. This was not a film of showing history from only a war point of view such as pure fighting and war scenes.The film has a very smooth flow and expressed the views in a rather intellectual way. people must take a close look at the personalities of the two main characters in the film.i would have to say that its one of the most impressive love movies made as well. The acting is breathtaking, especially of the indigenous girl. They managed to reflect the feelings and the way of living at the time very well. Also the main character of the 'New World' in comparison to the Red Indian also tries in an indirect way to show the differences between the systems, way of thinking and societies. There is no doubt that Red Indians must have liked the film more than the new owners of the USA as well as people who were expecting a typical American movie. I suppose this was the only non-typical American movie having the word' America' in its name.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Hubris on a Monumental Scale,"Here we have self confidence run riot.Malick has produced good, even great films in the past.And it has gone to his head.Here we see a director whose previous work has garnered almost total praise, and he believes he can do no wrong.What has resulted then, is the most pretentious and self indulgent film of the last decade.The dialogue is banal (quite an achievement given its paucity) The acting perfunctory, particularly Farrell's almost unintelligible performance (again, quite an achievement allowing how little he is given to say) The symbolism is obvious, leaden, repetitive, and ultimately tedious. The music, possibly Horner's worst is inappropriate and resembles little more than the orchestra tuning up to prepare to play.But does this matter.No thinks Malick... I am a genius... and so all is subsumed beneath his desire to SHOW us his masterpiece.It is quite clear that if he could have got away with showing us a series of paintings he would have been much happier. this is fine if we are in a gallery, but this is not a painting, this is a film, and a film of such total self regard that it makes Barry Lyndon seem positively insecure.Mr Malick, your movies have offered us declining returns on each occasion since Badlands.

A New World Meditation,"Amazing film. In order to fully comprehend the prison we call ""America"" and ""civilization"" I suggest to you that you go see this film in this manner. When you enter the theater instead of sitting silently or chatting with your friends take a look around at your fellow movie goers, try and make eye contact, smile...if this seems strange or uncomfortable meditate on the alienation of sitting separately and uncommunicative with your fellow human in a public place. Once you have had your look about then sit silently with you eyes close and relax . When the previews start keep your eyes closed and as you listen think about how the words devoid of the associative imagery are easily identified as mental programming instructions for the maintenance of our ""so-called-reality."" Do not open your eyes until you hear prayer to the sun spoken by Pocahontas at the beginning of the film. I assure you that if you approach the film in this way you will never think the same about the world you find outside the multiplex and will achingly mourn the loss of the land as it was and the people who once lived upon it. Terence Malik, the director tells a story with imagery rather than narrative and there is more to it than Jamestown, John Smith or Pocahontas. At the conclusion you realize that this film is a meditation upon Love as our natural state of being and how this Love is thwarted by a person seeking ambition, by a civilization that has long ago forgotten Love and seeks material wealth as a poor substitute and by the antagonism that exists in patriarchal cultures, whether ""natural"" or ""civilized.""",10.0,Anonymous,History

The New World wows with wonder and beauty,"I'll cut right to the end of the journey that is this review. I wanted to give it a 10 but didn't because of the ending. The ending should have followed the path the rest of the movie took. It is only because they got to the end and seemingly just decided to succumb to destiny that I did not give it a 10. The movie started out so beautifully, I almost began to wonder if National Geographic had actually found a time machine and went back to the time of Pochahontas. And while the scenery was beautiful, I am not referring only to the scenery being beautiful. I truly felt the movie's intent was to make the viewer believe he/she was being born into this time in history - acknowledging the presence of wondrous scenery and the mystery of humanity.I found it hard to compare it with any other movie I have ever seen. Try to remember the days of your innocence and you may find the same feelings while watching The New World.No performer performed so beautifully as Q'Orianka Kilcher. I will be disappointed if she doesn't at least get nominated for teen awards next year. Neither Colin Farrell nor Christian Bale impressed me but I do believe it was intentional to make their characters less attractive than Pochahontas.Just remember when you see this movie, if you want to enjoy and understand it, view it as you are just being introduced to a new world for the first time. Q'Orianka Kilcher will take you along with her gladly.BTW, the violence is nearly nothing more than gratuitous so don't expect violence to provide satisfaction.Beautiful job, Terrence Malick!!",9.0,Anonymous,History
"A pretentious, bloated travesty","Already this film is beginning to generate advance buzz that suggests that it's a poetic masterpiece.The fact is, anyone peddling that point of view has either not seen it or is blinded by the fact that it is directed by a man who made a very good film a very long time ago.What the film has in its favour is the kind of cinematography that automatically gives any film a professional sheen that can dazzle the most intelligent reviewers. However, that's the full extent of the positives.The script is so thin, so hackneyed and yet so portentous that it is difficult to believe it is the work of a man regularly venerated as a genius. In all its characteristics it most resembles the witterings of an angst-ridden teenager. Yawn as all three major characters spend more time speaking in voice-over than dialogue! Look confused as you attempt to keep up with Farrell's ever changing accent! Try not to laugh as Pocohontas impersonates a deer in a field as Farrell looks on with adoring eyes! Try not to get annoyed as you realise that Malick has cast the ugliest actors he could find to play the baddies! Boggle as you realise how trite the voice-overs are! Fall asleep as you give up expecting the film to become meaningful after two hours and just sit there waiting for it to end.The clumsiness of its visual and linguistic imagery has never been exceeded in any film I have seen in thirty years. It is patronising, stupid and vacuous at every turn. After one character compares human beings to trees, Malick cuts for thirty seconds to... a tree! When Pocohontas is presented to King James she is presented along with... caged animals from America (can you see what he's aiming at?)! When Pocohontas is unhappily reunited with Farrell it takes place in a perfectly clipped and bordered English garden (do you think he's trying to compare the American wilderness with the Old World's control over nature?).I do not expect to see a worse film in a long time, and if, as seems likely, it goes on to win any kind of award or plaudits from reviewers, it will be the worst case of The Emperor's New Clothes ever to be inflicted on the film industry.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A Perfect Betrayal,"I am sure others have explained why this film is great. Terrence Malick has a definite style and it is one that I find brilliant. The mood he creates is absolutely mesmerizing. He explores issues of subjectivity in a very interesting way and of course this film is incredibly beautiful. Do not expect an action or war movie. Most of the film is silent, lyrical, complex, and often heartbreaking. I could watch it 100 more times and probably will. The entire film is like a whisper. This movie is very much like The Thin Red Line but he reduces the number of story-lines to three. I thought the multiple and choppy story lines, often difficult to follow, in the thin red line was actually quite appropriate to embodying the nature of the Vietnam War. I think in the New World the focus on three stories and really ultimately one (that of Pocahantas) is very effective. It also gives a real 360 degree meaning to the title of the film. I think Malick is a master at synthesizing the medium of film and the narrative/subject. I can also see that this film would not satisfy the majority of audiences who are looking for something that is really the opposite of what The New World actually delivers.(A saw a few people walk out of the theater) However, this ""betrayal"" only makes the meaning of the film all the more powerful.",10.0,Anonymous,History
NO more movies with Colin Ferrell,"I gave Colin Ferrell some credit going into this movie. I saw Alexander, Swat, and phone booth. This movie is by far his worst. I took my wife to this movie last night and we almost walked out. She likes chick flicks and I like action movies. When we heard about this movie we both thought that it would satisfy both our needs. We were WRONG!!! The movie is SO boring I lost interest less then half way threw. Their is only one fighting scene (that was mediocre) and the 'love story' is terrible.The only thing that I did like was the location. Instead of watching the 'plot' I thought to myself how I would like to go fishing and hunting where they were.SO PLEASE DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE!!!

How can history be soooo boring?,"My guess is that most people have not heard of Terrence Malick. Outside of film enthusiasts and those people on the Ken Jennings side of the Trivial Pursuit knowledge belt, Malick is a name that isn't as well known as say a Scorsese or an M. Night. Hell, I would even venture that Michael Bay's name would illicit more recognition on the street than Mr. Malick. But hell, when you release only five films in thirty five years, what can we expect.That's right. I'll write it again just in case the numbers got lost on you the first time. Five Films. Thirty-five years. Look it up. I'll wait.Lanton Mills, Badlands, Days of Heaven, The Thin Red Line and now, The New World. It's a simple resume, yet Malick is considered one of the more revered directors on the film circuit. Personally, I could never understand why and with the The New World now out in theatres, I am bewildered even further.The New World is the story of Pocahontas - the version that isn't a Disney animated feature that had Mel Gibson prancing around in full Technicolor. Pocahontas is played by fairly newbee Q'Onraka Kilcher and follows her from when her tribe first meets the English settlers who land in Virginia in hopes of setting up a new colony. Pocahontas is particularly interested in John Smith (Colin Farrell) after she pleads for his life from her father Â– the leader of the tribe. Spared, John begins to teach her English and the two soon form a bond and a relationship that teases us for nearly 90 minutes before ending in an even more disappointing fashion.In the hands of Michael Bay, we may have put up with the lack of chemistry between the two leads as he would have had it sandwiched in-between overblown violent confrontations between the tribe and the settlers. But in the hands of Malick we get Pocahontas running in the fields, John Smith staring off into nowhere and the occasional holding of hands that is less sensual than when I pet my neighbors cat.The story does take an interesting turn in the final chapters when we are introduced to John Rolfe (Christian Bale who, interestingly enough, was the voice of a character in the 1995 Disney version). When Rolfe comes on the scene, Smith is long gone having faked his own death becauseÂ…well, who the hell really knows why. During her grieving, Pocahontas has become Westernized. She is no longer wearing native clothes, but rather corsets and shoes with heels. She has become fluent in the English language and accepts Rolfe as a husband even as she pines for the 'thought-as-dead' John Smith.Their relationship blossoms as the two actually touch, kiss and even have a child together before Pocahontas learns that Smith is still alive and accepts a trip to England in an effort to confront her feelings.We are probably past the two hour mark of the film now when the first thing that we actually give a damn about occurs, that being a meeting between Pocahontas and the long forgotten Smith where it will be revealed to the audience which one she will choose to fulfill her all too short life.Well, the result is not surprising due to how we got there in the first place, and even though you won't leave the theatre whistling a happy tune, at least we got an ending true to the story rather that a Hollywood re-work.But that in no way makes up for the meandering and lazing about we have to go through for 150 minutes before we get to the ending (which went on to an annoying musical score longer than the final chapter of Lord of the Rings: Return of the King last act). Too many of the audience's precious minutes are spent with camera shots of trees from the ground capturing the sunlight beaming down that I began to think that lying down in a forest all alone would be more rewarding than having to sit in an uncomfortably theatre chair and watch the same thing over and over and over again.So my lack of understanding as to the genius of Terrence Malick continues. I will agree that the guy knows his cinematography Â– maybe to a fault. But if this guy only produces a film on the same frequency as Haley's Comet, he at least doesn't have to subject us to view of the sky looking for the damn thing.www.robertsreviews.com",4.0,Anonymous,History
Loved this wondering lyrical film,"It's a long time since I went to a mainstream commercial cinema and was so taken by a film. In the style that Malick is known for, he seems to keep the camera, and therefore the viewer, in a mode that you feel is moving in and around and through real events unfolding. Yet the events also seem to be like memories recalled or dreams remembered.And the music... awe, jist great.I suspected I was onto a winner when several members of the audience dribbled out dazed and disappointed as they realised they were not watching the usual good ol' pap-and-violent-slush that the USA film industry pushes out.",10.0,Anonymous,History
pure poetry,"T. Malick's movies aren't for your run of the mill movie-goer. His transcendental influences are across every movie he has made, and the secret to his movies are that he is not simply telling the story of soldiers in WW2, or of Pocohontas and her people, but he is telling the story of God and Nature, and our fight within. I love the fact that he is willing to make the movies that need to be made. It's the stories that he creates and the poetry he places in front of us that reminds us why we go to the movies. He certainly is not your mainstream director, but when you see the list of actors flock to be in his movies you understand the amount of respect fellow artists have for his work, and that certainly may be the greatest compliment of all. His work is as legitimate as it was in the 70's as it will be as long as we appreciate the arts.",10.0,Anonymous,History

He fall in love whit Pocahontas but he can't forget why is there.His job is not to fall in love but to explore.That's why he remain cold,loyal to his job because he knew that his place was not there with Pocahontas...Pocahontas didn't care about anything,she just let go because she didn't know much. She learns in time that letting go is dangerous and with John Rofle she is more careful.There are many things in this movie i can give at an example of how knowledge makes everything different.Is like the things you know like an adult in comparison with how things seem to be when you were a child!Pocahontas feels the change in her life because of the knowledge and she become happier.I really love this movie from the beginning till the end.What a wonderful soundtrack !

This movie is a total time waste.,"This movie is one the most boredom films i've ever saw.. in fact, when I went to see it I left the cinema after about 30mins because I fell asleep out of boredom. Unless you're a person who gets all this touchy and emotional plus you have iron nerves and patience of steal, take my word on it, don't waste your money and time on this boredom. When I first saw the movie trailers and the kind of hype around it, I went to see it, but never thought it would be that bad.

A beautiful film.,"As with other Terrence Malick films, this broody lingering drama improves as time passes after you watch it. On initial thoughts i wasn't too impressed with the movie because i thought it too slow. After a few hours when the film had finished i found myself reveling in how beautiful and how understated this film really is. The long establishing shots are meaningful and used to great affect for this epic love tale.Don't expect a formulaic heart wrenching romance at the center of this movie as it will disappoint. It is replaced by a truly heartfelt deeper than words relationship established through gestures and actions, it is truly wondrous.Colin Farrell is subtly commanding as John Smith, showing that his performances have aged beyond blockbusters. All the actors do an extremely good job considering the amount of dialogue in this film as it is used sparely. This film is just short of completely breath taking. It is not quite a masterpiece, but a film very much to be proud of.",8.0,Anonymous,History

It just shows how surreal the whole experience must have been for everyone. Imagine how natives must have felt to be brought to England-mind exploder, dude.

Promising but does not deliver,"The New World has the promise of being an important movie, but falters.Perhaps all the details were wrong only to make the viewer realize that this is a story about 'love', and not a portrayal of actual events.However, the setting and story-line are too important to my frame of reference into the fantasy of time travel to be 'just' another exploration of what 'love' is. It would have been better had this movie been set in the Midwest with amateur actors! Perhaps Indiana! Then, the question by the beautiful natural of ""Did you find your Indies?"" could have been answered, ""Yes, it's south of Indianapolis.""However, the movie is set in Jamestown, and the girl seems to float bewitchingly between two cultures, one of which is 'natural' and one of which is attempting to destroy and have domain over all that is natural.I was left with wondering ""How did she escape being despoiled?"", or worse, to feel like ""Well, genocide is not as bad as I thought it might be.""

Wow!,"This would have been a totally awesome movie if the year was 1913, and they showed it in full color - it would have stood as the movie to beat for decades! But it's not. I saw this movie and i thought it was alright at the start, but it was hard to understand the dialogue and there was a lot of voice overs too, which didn't help too much. I don't know the real story of Pocahontas, and i guess if i did the movie would have made more sense. Anyway after watching about 1h 30m of this movie i got really bored and i started skipping a little bit ahead, and as it went on i started skipping a bit more ahead with increasing intervals until the movie was over. I compressed the last hour into about 20 minutes, and got most of the idea. But i tell you if this was a movie i went to see in the theater, i would have walked out for sure.This is like the first movie i've ever watched that i actually didn't want to watch anymore. I'm glad downloaded it instead and didn't pay to watch this movie. Hollywood films have been sucking a lot lately, which is why so many people are downloading flicks instead - they're tired of being ripped off! People want to have a good time in the theater, not pay 10 bucks to nap in an uncomfortable char, or get utterly bored to death. I'll give this movie another chance if they show it on cable or if I find the DVD out on the street. Hopefully it might be a better with the subtitles, and the ability to play 2x 3x speed.Bottom line: wait for cable/DVD.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Beyond beautiful,"With the newest Terrence Malick film, The New World, one looks for words that express a quality beyond beautiful, but there is no language. It is a work of stunning cinematic poetry whose appreciation, I believe, will grow with the passage of time, though it may never appeal to a wide audience. I came away from watching The New World with a feeling of having traveled back in time to a land of pristine beauty where the vigorous dream of establishing a sane civilization was still alive, if only for a brief moment. Malick attempts a retelling of that dream, specifically the vision of Pocahontas, the Indian princess, daughter of Algonquian Chief Powhatan, who imagined a country where both Europeans and Natives could live together without bloodshed.While actual events may have been somewhat different, Malick takes the story at face value, enhancing it only with voice overs that allow us to enter the minds of the characters and feel what they are feeling. The film opens with the arrival of three English ships docking on the James River in Virginia in 1607 to the music of Wagner's Das Rheingold. It then describes the early days of the settlers, their near starvation, the clashes with the Indians, and the relationship between Pocahontas and Captain John Smith (Colin Farrell), a rebellious English explorer awaiting execution for insubordination. When the Indians capture Smith during an expedition to seek trading partners, he is threatened with death until Pocahontas saves him from execution by cradling his head in her lap and laying her head on his shoulders.The Captain and Pocahontas become friends but the true nature of their relationship is clouded in myth and allegory. In the film, however, the Captain and his Indian princess express a love so intense that it suggests a state of grace. As Smith is drawn under her spell, he thinks about abandoning his life, to ""start over.... exchange this false life for a true one.... give up the name of Smith."" But the thought is fleeting. After Pocahontas warns the Captain of an impending raid by her villagers, her father sends her into exile. The settlers take her hostage, however, convert her to Christianity (not shown in the film), and dress her in frumpy English attire, but she is content just being close to the man she loves.Smith leaves Pocahontas, however, to explore the Canadian North for a trade route to the Indies, instructing a friend to tell her after two months that he died at sea. His betrayal and their doomed love affair serve as a metaphor for the failure of the Natives and the Europeans to live together in harmony. The spark in Pocahontas' life flickers but when a new settler, tobacco farmer John Rolfe (Christian Bale), arrives, he falls in love with her and asks her to marry him. She must now decide whether to follow her head and marry Rolfe or her heart, holding out for the return of Captain Smith. Her resolution of this dilemma takes her to England where the process of discovery takes on a new meaning.The role of Pocahontas is played by fourteen-year old Q'orianka Kilcher in a powerful and brilliant performance that never strikes a false note. While the director has excised most of the dialogue, little is required to convey the depth of feeling written on her soulful face or on the faces of Smith and Rolfe. Whoever Pocahontas really was, Malick depicts her as a spiritual force and the film achieves transcendence through her vision. The New World is a meditation on love and loss, innocence and betrayal, and the limitations of a society based on material progress.It is also a lament for the civilization that might have been: a multi-ethnic society rich in spirituality and closeness to nature, inhabited by people with a sense of community, devoid of fear. For the English explorers, the landing at Jamestown and the colonizing of Virginia was a triumph. For Native Americans, it was the beginning of a tragedy that lasted for centuries and continues to the present day. Though The New World is a masterful film and thoroughly enchanting, our knowledge of what is to come leaves a lingering sadness.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Often beautiful, very slow and obtuse","This film really should be caused ""Pocahontas"" but Disney took that name. While the film is beautifully photographed, with what seems like hours of flowing water and sun through the tree shots, the story and the editing almost completely hides what is going on in the story. In fact some of the editing makes the film look like a rough cut with black slugs filling in for missing scenes.What little dialog there is presented like an interior monologue (so ""boomy"" it is hard to hear what is being said); much is in Indian (they are called ""naturals"" to be P.C.)language with perhaps 8 subtitles during the TWO AND ONE HALF HOURS; when you can hear the dialog many of the actors speak so quickly and in such strong dialects it might as well be in Greek.When they are not yelling and slobbering at the camera the actors wander around with no expression so you can apply any feeling you care to their characters.The film also seems to have been a mystery to Colin Farrell who joins Tom Cruise in the area of remaining firmly in the 21st century while slogging through the 17th century like some out of place hippie in feathers and leather clothes and a lot of dirt.",2.0,Anonymous,History

It is a captivating, beautiful experience that you wish you could bring home to put on your wall so that you could look at it briefly whenever you liked, but it is not an entertaining film.

A Glimpse of Hell,"I have looked into the face of hell, and yawned. Hell is being locked into a theater and forced to watch Terrence Malick's ponderous 'The New World' for all of eternity. No thank you. I would rather find a rusty, sharpened piece of metal and gouge my eyes out.'The New World' is basically an exercise in patience. If you can watch a David Lynch film without falling asleep, than this might be the movie for you. It's visually stunning with the constant rippling of water and trees waving seductively in the wind, but a movie is more than its visuals. There are certain fundamental aspects that a movie cannot survive without. A coherent plot (are you reading this Lynch), intriguing dialog, and of course, convincing acting.There is no real plot to speak of. I can summarize it in short abrupt sentences that a caveman might use. Man loves girl. Man leaves. New man loves girl. Fin. There is no real dialog to speak of. The movie is mainly composed of whispered voice over that are as forgettable as the characters who say them. The characters are mainly forgettable due to the actors playing them, which is surprising, considering the obvious talent that Christian Bale and Colin Farrell (not including Alexander) have shown in previous films. Bale and Farrell maintain the same expression throughout the movie. Calling them wooden would be a disservice to ventriloquist dummies.Congratulations Malick, you are on my list, right between Uwe Boll and David Lynch. You are the Dr. Frankenstein of the 21st century. In your quest to create life, an abomination has been created. Who gave you the right to play god!

Yes I'm so sure Q'Orianka Kilcher will be nominated for something... but it will be one of those many nominations given out for the seriousness of the movie and not by the merit of the acting or power of the character. Collin Farrell once again lets you down with another poor job selling his character. Even ""BATMAN"" in his brief appearance doesn't do a good job of making his character stand out and become anything more than a flash on the screen.The music was wonderful... john Williams better watch out, because this score.I say save your money and do not go.

Malick's welcome return,"From the opening shot of Q'Orianka Kilcher's Pocahontas standing in the tall grass, her arms stretched out to heaven in adoration, we know we are in Malick territory. The opening sequence of the film, almost dialog free, is trade mark Malick. We see images of an idyllic paradise on earth, native children swimming in the sea and the adults peacefully co-existing with nature. As the European ships make their appearance,Malick shows the bewilderment of the natives at the sight of such alien crafts. James Horner's minimalist score superbly builds up the sense of awe. The New World marks Terrence Malick return after 1998's The Thin Red Line. Set in Virginia in 1607, It tells the story of Sir Walter Raleigh(Christopher Plummer)'s expedition to colonize America. On the ship is rebellious soldier of fortune Jonh Smith(an impressively under-played Colin Farrel).On the first hour of the film, Smith is captured by the natives and encounters Pocahontas, the young daughter of a chieftain.They instantly make a connection which will affect the fate of both natives and settlers. Performances are generally excellent, most notoriously newcomer Kilcher's, which perfectly conveys her character's innocence and sense of wonder, and Christian Bale's in a supporting role as the kindly tobacco farmer Jonh Rolfe. The Oscar Nominated photography is breathtaking and Malick's script and direction as poetic as ever. The pace of the film-as in all of Malick's films- is very slow, but it isn't really a defect as it is an element of Malick's style. This film didn't make a dent in the box-office but is surely destined for cult status. A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great film.,"I rented this film this past weekend without any real expectations. I was amazed to enjoy this movie as much as I did, it's probably one of my ten favorites now. However, I will advise anyone who reads this, this movie is not for everyone. The cinematography in this movie was amazing, and I was even more surprised that it was filmed in my backyard, Virginia. I felt the acting was great, especially on the part of those who played the native Americans. A good word to describe this film would be artistic, much of the voice-over dialogue was incredibly poetic. Much of the movie seemed to be an extended montage, which is something I enjoy.

Pocahontas was eleven years old when she met Smith and although they became friends there was no romance between them.The actors in the film were excellent and romantic scenes between Colin Farrell, Christain Bale and Q'Orianka Kilcher where filmed tastefully as they had to be since Q'Orianka was 14 when she made this film.

The use of the musical passages from Wagner and Mozart were inspired.One would never have guessed it was from the USA. I would love to see it again. The nearest I could compare it to was grand opera in terms of its impact. Surely the best thing Farrell has done. The use of freely mobile camera shots gave the impression of a documentary, as if you were with the first explorers of the continent.You had to use a lot of intuitive reasoning which got you deeply involved with the themes of the film.

"A big hype, then a big let down","For the hype that was about this movie, it really took me a long time to see it. I turned off the movie being left as eh? is that it? My husband couldn't even make it through the whole movie. When I finally saw it, the shots were amazing, but the dialogue was horrible. The emotions from the characters was great, but some of the acting between them was awful. It really is a 5/10 because this is a movie you are either going to hate or love.

The New World - A MUST SEE!,"The New World was fantastic! The reviews did not give it it's due credit. The genuineness of the scenes, characters and gestures from the Algonquin language, sign language to Pocahontas herself exceeded expectations. It's an epic that should be put in the same prestigious categories as Titanic and Troy.All the speculation that Q'rianka Kilcher's performance was exploitation since she was still a teenager at the time of her performance, without such an actress the movie would not have had the same haunting effect. None of the scenes exhibited exploitation, or anything of that sort. It is a love story, true and simple.The eight months it took to find her were definitely worth it. Colin Farrell also deserves credit for his successful and romantic portrayal of John Smith.A MUST SEE!",10.0,Anonymous,History
No Action and No Dialog,"Call this film what you want, but I call it boring. There's extremely little dialog. There's very little action. It's a very long film. Add those things up and you get boring. I really couldn't tell what was going on for the first half of the movie, then in the second half I realized that nothing was going on so there was nothing to understand. In place of dialog between characters you get bits of narration from different characters as the viewpoint changes from one person to another. You also get long silent scenes of people thinking or holding each other. Don't wait for some strong story line to emerge that pulls you into the movies or attaches you to the characters because that never happens. The morsels of action are a mystery since there's no clear motivation behind them.On the positive side, I will admit that the sets and costumes were well done. The film does pull together some acting talent, though it seems wasted.",4.0,Anonymous,History

She's destined to be a huge star in my opinion.I saw the earlier version and this one is much more concise. I think cutting some of then length really made a big difference. The audience in this latest version seemed much more enthralled and less anxious to go once the film grew long. Smart choice.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Once again, Hollywood messes up a great story.","This could have been a great film, that is, if the fascinating true story were used instead of this boring deception. There was, in fact, no romance between Captain John Smith and Pocahontas. Sorry! Smith was 27 in 1607 and Pocahontas was 10 or 11.I agree with a friend of mine who said that Smith comes across as a ""love sick puppy."" That was not the Smith of the historical record, not at all! Smith was a braggart and boastful, yet he was also a perceptive leader. Saving the failing colony was the great concern occupying Smith's thoughts, not a romantic fixation on a little Indian girl.Smith was only in Virginia from the spring of 1607 until the fall of 1609...two and a half years. There was a real (and unexpected and wonderful) romance in Pocahontas' life, but years later in 1613 and 1614 with John Rolfe...when she was an adult, at an age when Powhatan girls (and English girls) typically married. Smith was out of the picture and long back in England when Pocahontas had her real adult romance resulting in a marriage to John Rolfe and a son Thomas.This film was overly long, got the facts all mixed up, overlooked the most important elements of a fascinating story, had a poor soundtrack, and...well...it had some nice photography. (That's why I didn't rate it a 1.)If you have an interest, read the amazing true story from the historical record written by Smith, Rolfe, Hamor, Strachey, Percy, Archer, Dale and others. It's all there. This is just another example of where ""the book"" is far more interesting than the movie. And, heck, much of the book was written by Smith and Rolfe themselves!Too bad the creative types in Hollywood have to create fluff like this simply to showcase their high-priced celebrities. See it if you're willing to sit still for a very long time and you enjoy being bored almost to tears. At least the Disney deception back in 1995 had some pretty music.",2.0,Anonymous,History

"For better or worse, Malick does it his way.","If nothing else, at least The Hound can now say he's seen a film with Colin Farrell in it. And for the record, he isn't bad. His John Smith pretty much stands around and gives the camera a forlorn look or chases Pocahontas around in the tall grass. There are worse ways to spend your time, I guess.Love him or leave him, Terrence Malick makes pictures on his own terms and for that reason alone he must be respected. Never mind the fact that his films are never commercially successful. Those expecting an exciting epic along the lines of Last of the Mohicans will be disappointed. There is a battle scene or two, but the action is neither graphic, nor terribly compelling. The real story here is the discovery of different cultures by both Native Americans and English settlers. We see what happens when the English land at Virginia in 1607 and encounter the local natives. You'd have to think that scene where the two sides first meet in that field would have been pretty accurate. It's hard to imagine how odd each group would have seemed to the other. Anyway, before too long, the ""Naturals"" are out to rid themselves of the white settlers, but the romance between the chief's daughter (Pocahontas) and Captain John Smith (Farrell) muddies the waters considerably.For the record, I liked the film. It is like other Malick films in terms of structure. The narrative takes a back seat to the scenery and mood of the film. The scenery, as one usually gets with Malick, is exceptional. Nearly every shot is at eye-level and has a large object or expanse of nature in the background. James Horner's score is subtle in some places, then overwhelming in others. Farrell isn't asked to do all that much as Smith, but he won't disappoint you. Christian Bale who comes on the scene later on is a much more developed character, and you will be glad he's there. Newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher is a site to behold. She is such a beautiful young woman that sometimes she even outshines the scenery around her. She was a perfect casting choice, and actually shows she can act, too! The verdict: A good film, but the 150 minute version is just too long. Some of the shots of the actors wandering around in nature just get redundant, but not necessarily unpleasant. If the film had been edited down to around 90 minutes like Days of Heaven, then it might have worked better. The New World is still a considerable cut above The Thin Red Line, however. The existentialism and voice overs just didn't work with the war setting.I would recommend this film, but be warned: Do not forget to pack your attention spans! The casual viewer will probably be bored stiff.8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Exquisite slice of dramatic geography, Farrell suits himself nicely along side Malick","*** Colin Farrell, Christopher Plummer, Christian Bale, O'Orianka Kilcher, Wes Studi, Jamie Harris. Directed by Terrence Malick Normally a redundant story line involving a feud and then settlement between settlers and a Native Tribe. This time focusing on John Smith (Farrell), who upon capture is brought back to the tribes leader. But instead of death, leads him to a chemistry between a young girl Pocahontas (Kilcher). Sound familiar? If it does, it probably reminds you of 2003's ""Last Samuri"" where upon capture is taught the ways and language of the local's. Malick does a fine job making an exquisite slice of 17th century dramatic geography. And Bale although not receiving as much screen time as he should, going double for Plummer still do a fine job. Despite some of Farrell's recent projects which left me bored, ""New World"" is beautiful in cinematography and acting.

A masterpiece,"This film is a masterpiece, pure and simple, on every level.... acting, cinematography, costume design, makeup, screenplay, music, directing, etc, etc. It's one of those rare films which transports you to a different time and place, and makes you believe, really believe that it's real (or could have been real). Unlike most one-dimensional movies, which either portray European settlers as good guys against savage barbarians, or Europeans as brutal conquerors and native people as noble saints; this film acknowledges the reality: there was savagery and nobility on both sides, but most of the time, it was real people on both sides who were each facing a ""new world"".The scenery is beautiful, almost mystical. The acting is right-on, from the young actress who plays a native princess with passion, emotion, and joy; to the men who come to love her (each very different and brilliantly portrayed), to the reliable Christopher Plummer and August Schellenberg as tough but fair leaders of their people, to the array of actors in supporting roles.Some reviewers have criticized the film for a lack of ""plot"" or ""storyline"". Sure, if you're looking for the next ""Usual Suspects"" or ""Sixth Sense"" with a surprise around every corner, then you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for car crashes and chainsaws and dismembered body parts in every other frame, then you'll be disappointed. If you're looking for gratuitous nudity and sex, you'll be disappointed. BUT, if you're seeking an epic story with gorgeous cinematography which delves into the thoughts, emotions, and actions of people who are interesting and who you REALLY care about over the course of years, then this is for you. The film reminded me of the best and most beloved of the epic romance/adventures of the past: Gone With The Wind, Doctor Zhivago, Out Of Africa, etc. This film will rank with, and possibly surpass, those classics.This is a must-see.

Overall poor - don't waste the money,"I had the choice of seeing End of the Spear or this and chose wrongly! Colin Farrel does not a good movie make. It needs a great script, great cinematography, a decent editor and a great supporting cast. This film had none of those. The Pocahontas actress was decent enough for an amateur I suppose (she learned English quite quickly). There was a period in the film where she is separated from John Smith, and told he is dead. There is no explanation for telling her that. Then he shows up later and continues their relationship. She was as confused as I was! The overall story was disjointed in the filming of it. Also, the point of view of the camera was very confusing. Shooting very close on battle scenes and never giving the viewer the bigger perspective.

Timeless beauty surrounds the most violent change.,"This film proceeds at a pace many viewers would find slow, but I believe the intent behind that pace conveys the AmerIndian mindset of living fully in the present, of small regard for the passage of time. Our present culture, in contrast, focuses heavily upon the immediate future and what is new. We need to adjust our expectations accordingly in order to better appreciate the amazing accomplishment of ""The New World.""This screenplay is more evocative than narrative, which works well in illustrating barriers in language, while the motives, experience and relationships we all hold dear - no matter what our circumstance or culture - shine through.Although the screenplay streamlines the story of Pocahontas, it nevertheless presents a tribute to this remarkable woman. Her life bore tremendous significance at an age in life when many of us haven't yet learned to drive.When I consider Miss Kilcher was only 14 during the filming, her achievement in this role is nothing less than astonishing.Take the time to savor and ponder this film.

The New World of Cinematic Tedium,"Acclaimed Director Terrence Malick comes out of hibernation to concoct this moribund outlook on the legend of Pocahontas. The year is 1607, and King James envoys set foot on the rustic shores of Virginia, intent on building the first European Colony in America. They encounter the Powhatan Indians, but no epic battle ensues. Terrence Malick focuses his energy on the romantic bond between authority challenged sailor John Smith ( Colin Farrell ), and the Powhatan princess Pocahontas ( Q'Orianka Kilcher ). I haven't watched a movie this slow paced since Moby Dick was Tuna. Scenes of affection between Smith and Pocahontas are repetitious, and indeed the order of the day. The accompanying monologues in voice-overs complete the moviegoer's zombification process in an ""EYES WIDE SHUT"" sort of way. I did manage to refrain from exploding in an outcry of "" WHAT'S NEXT ? "". What's next is more of the same, with settler John Rolfe ( Christian Bale ) vying for Pocahontas' heart, following Smith's departure from the settlement. A reprieve from the doldrums is granted in the form of sporadic attacks by the indians, but this is not sustained. You see, war is not an angle of this historical saga Malick wishes to contemplate, and that's really a shame. Wes Studi, known for his compelling Indian Warrior performances in ""Dances with Wolves"", and ""The Last of the Mohicans"" is only here to adorn the Virginia wilderness. He might as well have been building sand castles at nearby Chesapeake Bay. I hope his star rating doesn't drop like a cliff-diver in Acapulco. Malick compensates for an obvious lack of variety in his material by prolonging scenes of Pocahontas' playful disposition to kingdom come, slowing the pace of the movie to a nightmarish crawl. The Cinematography is eye catching, and the symphonic score is somewhat enjoyable. The acting by the main actors is commendable ( Kudos to Kilcher for a respectable debut ), but this is a rather boring flick destined for the DVD shelves in double quick time. The storyline is painfully mono-directional, and I just couldn't keep myself interested for 2.5 hours. I could be standing on the buffet line for crow two months from now, but I don't anticipate huge Box Office receipts for this tortoise of a movie.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Hypnotic beauty that draws you in and leads to an emotionally powerful  finale,"As much as I view all of Terrence Malick's films as masterpieces, this, the 170+ minute version of this film is my favourite. The story, of the arrival of the first British explorers in what is now Jamestown, Virginia , United States is less a history lesson, more another of study of 3 characters' life journeys within a lavishly realised natural environment. These are explorer John Smith, played very effectively in an understated, restrained and compassionate way by Colin Farrell; Settler John Rolfe, played in a similar fashion by a surprisingly gentle and compassionate Christian Bale; and a stunning performance by first time 15 year old actress Q'orianka Kilcher as Pocohontas. The film is closer in style to Badlands and Days of Heaven, in that it follows a specific story focusing on these characters, with Pocahontas forming the crux of the plot. The first part of the film is the development of a relationship between Smith and Pocohontas, evolving to a more complicated, but ultimately stronger relationship between Rolfe and Pocohontas.Malick again is very flexible with individual scenes, and it is clear that improvisation is still a key aspect of the actors' performances. Malick also was known to mould scenes further in post production and the abstract and minimalist narration seen in Badlands and Days of Heaven is seen again, albeit we hear more characters narrations rather than just the one. The film is closer in structure to first two films than compared to Thin Red Line, which was more a series of vignettes, rather than a story heading towards a clear denouement, as the New World is. However, unlike Badlands or Heaven, this film is more optimistic, and its ending is has a real emotional impact on the viewer. It certainly made me want to see it again, with the ending staying in my head long after the film ended. Like Kubrick, Malick requires the viewer to be patient, and if so they are rewarded with an emotionally involving story between the characters, and a hypnotic creation of atmosphere and environment that draws you in. On Blu-Ray it looks absolutely magnificent.The film is further assisted with excellent supporting performances, notably from veteran Christopher Plummer as Captain Newport, August Schellenberg as Powhatan and Wes Studi (who always seems to crop up in these sort of films â€“ e.g. Dances with Wolves and Last of the Mohicans) as Opechancanough. The chemistry between Farrell and Kilcher in particular is a real strength of the film. How Malick got such a fantastic performance out of her is a real testament to his skill as a director, but kudos has to also go to Farrell's support for the young actress, as well as a clear talent being brought to the surface from Kilcher herself. While her's and Farrell's scenes are intimate, Malick keeps it seemingly innocent but tactfully and tantalisingly leaves some ambiguity as to whether the relationship is more intimate that what you see on the screen. Malick is too much a class act offer anything gratuitous or obvious, and the film is so much better for it.The action sequences, while few and far between (it is not what the film is about), when they happen, like The Thin Red Line they are shot with real style and panache, albeit they do feel slightly sanitised in this film. The film further benefits from some real trenchant technical contributions. The most significant is veteran Mexican photographer Emmanuel Lubeski, who makes the film look absolutely magnificent, no doubt assisted by Malick himself and clever use of Steadicam (by veteran operator Jim McConkey). James Horner, like Zimmer in The Thin Red Line, had to write most of the score before the film had finished being edited. As a result the music plays more like a series of suites. However, this approach seems to work well and the music also adds to the mood and emotions in the film very effectively. Some Wagner (Das Rheingold) added to the score also works very well and creates a very effective mood and feel. The editing, led by Hollywood veteran Richard Chew is clearly in the Malick style (lingering shots of characters, and shots of the environment playing a prominent role in setting up a scene, sudden story time-line jumps) and works very well. Kudos to the production design crew led by (Malick veteran) Jack Fisk, which totally convinces you what time period you are in.Overall this film is a magnificent achievement. A compassionate and emotional involving story beautifully told. Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Perhaps my least favourite Malick, but still very good","I can understand again why those mayn't like Terrence Malick and his films, and this film too. I am not one of those people though, I highly appreciate Malick and his films too.The New World is probably my least favourite of his work, but that doesn't mean bad, just that I enjoyed his other films more. The slow pace didn't bother me, I think it was deliberate and also a characteristic of Malick, however I do think some scenes do drag and the story while often poetic and poignant is not always as involving as I would've liked.However, Malick's direction once again is spot on, the music is beautiful and haunting and the photography and images/scenery are astounding. The dialogue is fine and effort is gone into making the audience care for the characters particularly with Pocahontas. The acting I have no problem with either, the lady who plays Pocahontas is very compelling and moving and holds her own against Colin Farell and Christian Bale, both excellent.All in all, very good but perhaps my least favourite of Malick's work. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,History
Expensive Documentary,"The set, wardrobe and makeup departments should win an award. However, an extreme use of voice overs, the endless use of beauty shots of Smith and Pocahantus walking and caressing in the forest, in the fields, by the river make this film about 45 min. too long. If you're a history buff, its a great view into what life must have been like at this particular time and place...no Hollywood glamor or stylized sets. It's gritty, dirty and raw. But in the end, it seemed like a very expensive documentary. With a degree in history and a love for Native American culture, I had really looked forward to the release.

Exquisite if taxing Tone Poem,"Those heading into Terrence Malick's THE NEW WORLD expecting a ""story"" will probably soon become bored, if not outright bewildered by his visionary tone poem about the early settling by westerners of Virginia focusing on Pocahontus, John Smith and (to a lesser extent) John Rolfe.Malick's THIN RED LINE similarly used the approach of having several characters' inner thoughts heard as a sort of ghostly voice-over to the events we see. Indeed, without the voice-overs, large sections of the film almost play as they would if they were a Silent Movie. Long dialogue-less sequences with overlapping edits cover large sections of the film. Even critical ""plot points"" are cover with simple fades and cuts. It certainly taxes one's patience, especially over the 149 minutes the original version ran/runs (At this writing, a shorter cut was being planned for wide release; a futile effort for it can't be edited to make it a mass appeal film).The film rewards one's patience once the symbolic and poetic structure of the piece comes clear. Indeed, the film's major flaws are precisely WHEN it tries to present a plot or a story. It's as if a non-verbal spell has been broken. Rarely would a screenwriter allow so much of his work be in the hands of his technicians as does Malick (doubtless under his strict control). The Cinematography (Emmanuel Lubezki), Production Design (Jack Fisk), Music (James Horner, his best in a long while) etc. are vital to the telling and they all come up aces here. All of these elements come together in an absolutely masterful closing sequence (dialogue-less, naturally).One final note on the Sound for the film (not unexpectedly, brilliant): Malick truly understands the importance of silence and/or sparse precise natural sounds in Cinema. Too often people (even in the business) judge Film Sound on the basis of how MUCH and how LOUD it is, not how it's used creatively.",,Anonymous,History
I owe Malick $8,"I thought of Malick as an visual director from the 1970s, who was away from film-making too long and disappointed with his 1998 ""Thin Red Line."" Typical Malick film: gorgeous, but weak story. Thus, I didn't see ""The New World"" when it came out in 2005. But I did see ""Tree of Life"" in theatrical release, and judged it the best film of last year. So when ""New World"" was available On Demand, I caught it, and felt guilty that I hadn't forked over my 8 bucks 7 years ago. Malick has transcended story. Beauty for its own sake works here as it did with ""Tree."" There are scenes, impressions, but no coherent script, and it doesn't matter.

Well, you wouldn't know by watching this movie that's for sure! No, while the movie was mytho-historically, culturally and in all other ways mundanely accurate, it was to my way of thinking a near total waste of celluloid and low, low expectations. Did I say totally meaningful and overly creative at the expense of cohesion and story content? If you are looking to see some amazing actors and wasted talent, beautiful imagery and beat-you-over-the-head artistic form for the already pretentious - please go see this movie. I don't hate this movie. Really. How could I? I gave it a three.",1.0,Anonymous,History
I love this movie.,"The musical score, and the pacing of the story, constantly, and the actors repeatedly, capture for me the feeling that the British must have had for ""the new world"" between 1607 and 1616. After watching it three times, the ending of the movie still seems too ambiguous, but this is a tiny negative. And after almost all of the movie demonstrated its director's artistic rendering of British feeling for the new world IN the new world, the last scenes in England demonstrated an equally artistic rendering of British feeling for the new world in London. Pocohantas in the Court of James among the exotic animals and birds brought back from her America was absolutely perfect. And all this is not to even mention the plot, with its bright and loving, innocent princess fallen and degraded only to endure, and prevail, and finally accept all for what it is, like she had at the beginning, but finally with a knowledge of two worlds.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Same level of sensitivity as a Jean-Claude Van Damme,"This film was not my worst ever, but nearly. Historical dramas are I could say my favorite genre. I grew up in a very small town right next to a ""native reserve"" from which I counted a couple of my best friends. I've always had empathy for the Americas original inhabitants and am always interested in how they are portrayed in movies (which is usually disappointing, but I keep trying) so this was my frame of mind when I paid for this movie at Regal Cinemas. Within approximately 45 minutes, my disappointment had already started.I think most nature lovers agree, when the sun's rays shine through leaves, it is a beautiful sight, and running through tall grasses can certainly have an appeal, but in this movie, these 2 images fill nearly a third of screen time. Followed closely by images of the 2 non-lovers staring into each others eyes or His hands groping at Her (she's a child!!!) By the middle of the movie, the endless slow motion clips of the sun's rays and swaying grasses were reminding me of a Jean-Claude Van Damme movie. That's exactly his gimmick: take a severely lacking script and dress it up with endless slow motion shots of sunsets and nature. Don't get me wrong I am a sucker for cinematographic portrayals of nature, but one can't repeat the same shot over and over and over again. Take March of the Penguins, nature shooting at it's finest.An hour and a half into this film, I can't even use the word movie anymore, I'm thinking, when is the story going to begin! I have learned absolutely nothing about this period in history, people's thoughts. All we know is the ""naturals"" are flip-flopping between bringing gifts or warring with the colonialists, and Pocahontas's narration can probably fit into one page with large print. She repeats the same things over and over again, which only served to make the Indians seem really lacking in intelligence. Actually, that is also a sentiment that came over me, this movie completely lacks respect for Native American culture. It unfortunately made them seem like simple minded grunting beasts. Outrageous.I never walk out of a movie. Movies are my favorite pass-time and I will sit through most anything. However I do sometimes fall asleep (maybe 8 times in total, out of 4 shows a week for a quarter century) and I didn't in this one, but many other patrons did fall asleep.And then oh surprise, Christian Bale came on screen (I didn't know he was in this), and I thought ""finally, maybe we'll get some resolution"" but no, nothing new (nor in the story nor in the acting) came of his presence. In my opinion, Christian and Collin both have strong acting skills, but they absolutely require strong direction because otherwise they both come off as very wooden.By the end, I was so disappointed. Mind you, my expectations were not that high, as I've only ever liked 2 each of Collin's and Christian's movies (The recruit, At home at the end of the world, The mechanic, Batman begins). But when I have low expectations, usually a movie will leave me not completely dissatisfied. Not the case here, this movie will not go down in history as anything. It will be forgotten and the story of Pocahontas remains untold.",1.0,Anonymous,History
What a majorly fictitious snore,"I had such high hopes for this flick. It was dragged out and overly idealized and gaggingly romantic (and I say that as a woman who likes romantic films). Dull parts protracted to the point of near pain. My husband fell asleep. People were leaving, and they paid good money to see it. Very beautiful, but dumb. Some parts were true, although symbolic, some of it twisted. Not a movie for a history buff who cares. Does anyone who makes movies nowadays care about the truth? In the case of Pocahantas, the truth was more interesting than the sappy stuff they foisted on us. The scenery is lovely, though. Lots of scenes of people walking through fields, lots of water flowing over rocks. Just don't expect to be entertained. Bring your blankey and your binky. It's naptime.",,Anonymous,History
A Beautiful Film,"I loved watching this movie. The scenery was amazing! I'm a little bias since some of the movie was shot in and near my home town of Virginia Beach. It's breathtaking, but certainly isn't for people who like movies that have a lot of talking and action. This is a movie for people who like to sit down and enjoy beauty. It's really more of an emotionally driven movie, with the dialogue as an accessory to the story, not the driving force. I loved the way Virginia was shown. It really is a beautiful state. And, of course, everyone knows the story, but to see it again was lovely. I heard a lot of negative things about this movie, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. The only criticism I have is that it did drag in some parts. It's a slow paced movie, but it's not too bad. Because of the dragging, I'm only giving it 9 out of 10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Truly awful,"Whilst i can appreciate that a lot of people somehow enjoyed this film, i feel that the reviews don't really give enough of a warning to people looking for a good movie to watch.I picked up this film with little knowledge of the director or the film itself. Had i known beforehand that the director was also responsible for The Thin Red Line, i would have put it back on the shelf straight away.Needless to say, this film had no entertainment value in it whatsoever, indeed there is little in the way of dialogue, just lots of shots of scenery that i'm sure some people found breathtaking, but if you want to see scenery, what on earth are you doing indoors watching a DVD...? I had hoped to maybe learn a little about Pocohontas in this film.

My favorite film,"I have watched this movie well over a dozen times since I saw it in the theater in 2005. I was mesmerized then and am still mesmerized every time I watch it. This movie is simply art. Watching it is like watching a painting, a beautiful painting.Terrance Malick directed this film brilliantly. I still find it hard to believe that he was able to film in such a pristine and perfect location to film. There is not much dialogue in the movie but it doesn't need any. You can clearly tell what the movie is about without having to listen to a script.What can I say? I just love this movie. The beauty and purity of it always brings me to tears.

New World-same old rubbish,"As a person that doesn't usually sign up to online forums, comment rooms and such, it took a lot to infuriate me enough to write this report. I paid good money to watch this film, which had the potential to be excellent. Unfortunately, it was reminiscent more of a seventies B movie, than a classy piece of film making. Take an Indian squaw, who spent the whole film wandering around and sighing ""Who am I"", and musing the deep thoughts one only reads in arty books, rather than worrying about where her next meal was coming from and a film hero who was next to useless, so bad, I wanted to kill him myself, an absolutely awful set of lines for the cast..........need I say more.We left the cinema an hour before the end, and were by far the first to do so. About half the audience had left before us and the only two left on our row were asleep.I had heard all the critics ranting and raving about this film, well, I have utterly lost faith in them and can only assume they were paid to praise the film, perhaps it would have been better had they been paid for their honesty.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Well worth seeing for these 2 facets alone. Superb captivating opening sequence. Definitely deserved a nationwide release at the cinemas but wouldn't be considered these days as mainstream cinema. This is a classic love story and is a labour of love from start to finish. Flawless acting all round by a very strong cast. This film touches the emotions and lingers in the mind long after the end credits. Well worth seeing purely as a piece of superbly made modern cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,History

This is it; this is what film making is, this is why I watch movie after movie hoping to come across one that can make me feel something, happy or sad, I don't know really know which I'm at the minute.Please if you are spending a quiet evening on a weekend, give it chance.

I have waited since the first release date of The New World had been canceled to see the movie because from the trailer it looks way beautiful and sound pretty interesting ( I liked Pocahontas from Walt Disney a lot, I saw both parts of it.) Today, Jan 20th, I saw the movie and i was really upset. I love long movie (like King Kong, i love that one.) but The New World... i don't know, it just a pretty long and boring show of the story.

I still encourage our friends to go and see the way the producer makes this movie (make up was OK IF there are some interesting actions were in the movie...). And, i know the soundtrack didn't work that good, it was really annoying at some parts of the movie. It was playing for too long and too loud, it just didn't fit well in the movie.

What does this world do to us?,"If we take the time to look at it, really see it. The wind blows ever so, the river runs ever onward, ever the waves ride on the ocean. Snakes slither in the sea, baby turtles run up our bodies. If we let them.Does this not have the power to change us?The land is a way of life, the people just come and go. There once was a time, where people lived. They lived so. What did they talk about? What did they dream of? That time is gone, those people are gone. What they talked of is not important. The land is. It's eternal.Malick understands this. Often, his camera will break away from a conversation to look at the grass sighing in the wind. Most of his shots of people are of them walking in the grass, touching them, feeling them, feeling other people, talking by touch.People love each other, they sit together in the grass, stare at each other, smile a lot, touch each other's bodies. They hardly ever talk. Love is an exploration, of the other's body, of the other's mind. Silence is the best language to communicate.""What else is life but being near you? Do they suspect?

The New Boredom,"If your expecting this film to be anything like ""Last of the Mohicans"" you will be very disappointed.The film itself is 2 and a half hours long in which nothing what so ever happens, the only fight scene if you can call it that lasts about 3 minutes. The rest of the film is like a very boring montage of over the top orchestral music and pointless imagery. I think the director was trying to create a visual masterpiece but none of the scenery was interesting or breath taking, e.g. some hedges in England were shown for about ten minutes interlinked with Pocahontas splashing her face in a puddle, while the same orchestra music that had been playing continuously through the whole film was just played even louder.The main character Captain John Smith is actually from my home town of Alford in Lincolnshire, England, so i cant understand why Colin Farrel was cast to play him, the distinctive Irish accent completely destroyed the credibility of the whole film. Nearly half of all the dialogue in the film was narrated by the various characters telling you nonsense that had nothing to do with anything, instead of them just speaking with each other. The first half of the movie is the love story between the Native Indian Princess Pocahontas and John Smith set in ""The New World"", the second half is the same story again but set in England with a different love interest in the form of Christian Bale.I don't know what the director was trying to achieve but he failed, there was no change in pace throughout and i was left feeling like it never really got started, there was nothing educational in it, there was no real character motivation or interaction due to the constant narration which was incredibly annoying, Colin Farrel just cant sound inspirational!I am now going to recreate the film by playing 30 seconds of Beethovens 9th on a loop for two and a half hours while staring at a bush in my garden!",1.0,Anonymous,History
Frustrating but Ultimately Rewarding,"It's a shame that Terrence Malick has never found the balance between what we see and what we know in his films. At this late stage I'm beginning to think it's too late for the old dog to learn new tricks. As with ""The Thin Red Line"", you'll be hard-pressed to find a better looking film in the genre, but this is both the movie's gift and its curse. The New World is like getting a stack of postcards, sixty years late, addressed to your grandmother from her then boyfriend who soon after died in the war. It's words are few, careful and secret. It's pictures lush and exotic. It speaks of a feeling that somehow lasted through the ages. If you were to film the ""story"" you discerned from those post cards -from the feelings buried in the margins- you would have ""The New World"". A film so transcendental it transcends the audience, and leaves us behind as it continues to run unhindered by our needs anymore. Half Discovery Channel documentary, half Pocahontas home video collection, the movie tells a historically accurate version of the events that lead to Pocahontas travelling to England to meet the Queen. It's lucky that the girl they found to play her embodies her inquisitive, energy so well because the movie rests almost entirely upon her shoulders. Ferrel playing John Smith, like a sad sack washed out baseball player, does admirably in their minimalist scenes together. Creating a sense that we're watching what can never be put into the words of history, because history isn't interested in love, only sin.There's not much exploding, and very little action for those thinking ""big historical epic"", but you will find painstaking detail, and one of the harshest looking portrayals of the hard winter suffered by the British that first year after making landfall. Overall, a frustrating but ultimately rewarding experience that might play better in a museum than in a theater.",,Anonymous,History
Gorgeous,"The New World is undoubtedly the most gorgeous film I have ever seen! Stunning scenery, a brilliant score by James Horner, incredible performances by all involved, not least of all Q'Orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas. She has extremely expressive features, which never fail to draw out the emotions of her audience. Every frame of this movie is absolutely breathtaking and I doubt that I'll ever tire of any moment of this film. I love how eloquently Terrence Malick tells the story of John Smith, Pocahontas, and John Rolfe. When our characters are happy and free, we are happy and free, when they are tortured, we are tortured, and we have enough perspective on each character to avoid being judgmental. I can't get the scene out of my mind with John and Pocahontas standing on opposite sides of the fire outside of the fort as Pocahontas pleads with John to ""come away.""

I thought it was rotten eggs - but no - it was this movie!,"3 starsDuring the film, Pochontas says: ""We are grass."" Whatever the heck that means. I think it meant whoever authored this mess smoked way too much grass while writing it.The film is filled with this kind of babbling, pseudo-poetic nonsense by all the characters - that is - what time they bother to speak to each other at all. Frequently questions are asked by one character to another, but never answered.Pochontas is especially mute. Even after she learns English, Pochontas rarely says more than the occasional word or two, preferring apparently to spend most of her time looking expressionlessly at the ground.By the way, the young actress playing Pochontas had such a fat upper lip I could only conclude she'd had a collagen injection for it. I don't know why she didn't have the bottom lip done, perhaps she ran out of money. Now that she's made this film, maybe she'll have the funds to finish distorting both of her lips.The handsome Irish actor, Colin Farrell plays Capt. John Smith. What time he isn't rambling like a degenerate in need of a brain transplant, he just looks nervous, worried, or scared. Come to think of it - that's the only three expressions I've ever seen Colin portray in any film I've ever seen him in. Fortunately, in ""Phone Booth"" these 3 expressions did him well. In ""The New World"", he could have done with a bit more diversity.Throughout the film, John Smith remains looking as if his hair is greasy and like he needs a thorough scrubbing, even when he isn't in the wilderness, but in England.Now my history books always led me to believe there was never any romance between Pochontas and Capt. John Smith, but bear in mind folks, this is Hollywood, and Hollywood films invariably write history to suit themselves. So, of course, we have to have a romance between John Smith and Pochontas, even though, as we all know, she marries a man named Rolfe.I can't imagine who would find any interest in this draggy film beyond either fans of the actors/actresses in it, or an avid history buff.I had looked forward to seeing this film.

The Antidote for No Doze,"In 1607 Virginia, handsome Captain Colin Farrell (as John Smith) arrives in ""The New World"" of America and discovers nubile Native American beauty Q'orianka Kilcher (as Pocahontas aka Rebecca). The clearly aroused duo fall in love, despite great culture and age differences. Filmmakers do portray ""Pocahontas"" as underage; and, sexual relations are ""tastefully"" implied rather than explicitly shown. Though, love blooms for the legendary duo, fate plans otherwise; and, handsome Christian Bale takes over.This is a very beautiful film, with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki lushly realizing director Terrence Malick's vision. The Native Americans were most interesting. The English call them ""Naturals"" instead of ""Indians"", and they receive a more flattering portrayal than in decades past. The scenery is gorgeous, but the story is too dreamy - it all has an hypnotic, sleep-inducing effect. Don't watch ""The New World"" after dinner without having a very strong cup of coffee.

A True Masterpiece,"After seeing The New World it is one of the most outstanding films ever made in the history of cinema director Terrence Malick has created a wonderful story with great scenery and a dedicated group of actors.Newcomer Q'Orianka Kilcher played the role of Pocahontas beautifully and delivered an Oscar worthy performance, Colin Farrell & Christian Bale were fantastic as John Smith & John Rolfe the two men who captured her heart. I've only seen one other film that was directed by Terrence Malick and it was 1973's Badlands since then this is the second film of his that has captured my attention.The year is 1607 Captain Christopher Newport(Plummer) is leading a group of 103 men aboard three ships on a journey across the sea to a small native village to reach an agreement with the local tribe for a piece of land.Among them is John Smith (Farrell) a 27 year old troublemaker about to be hanged for some petty crimes, Newport stops the hanging on the condition that Smith continue to lead the men on that mission. However when he is captured by the tribe and about to die Pocahontas (Kilcher)the young daughter of chief Powhatan (Schellenberg) saves his life and the chief allows this stranger to teach his child about the world across the ocean and the English language.Pretty soon a powerful bond forms between the couple that is stronger than love and friendship but after an attack on the Indians Powhatan sends his youngest child away to another village forever so she won't be killed. Smith returns home , however not too soon after his departure Pocahontas receives the tragic news that he passed away before reaching England her heart is broken but she moves on with her life. A few years later while adjusting to a new life she meets John Rolfe, (Bale) a plantation owner who allows her to work on his farm and teaches her to read. Meanwhile she gets baptized and her name changed to Rebecca when this man asks for her hand in marriage she accepts and they live happily in his home and a son Thomas is born.During a visit in England She discovers that John Smith has been alive all these years and they see each other again for the last time before returning home she gets pneumonia and dies at the age of 22.

precise in its facts yet imaginative with its story,"As far-fetched as it sounds, The New World isn't too far off from another version of the same story: the Disney musical Pocohantas of exactly 10 years ago. It tells the story of John Smith and Pocohantas without the corny music numbers and of course it isn't animated but the romance is still there. John Smith and Pocohauntas were historical figures but they're also myths and some parts of their history are left to our imagination. Terrence Malick takes on the story with that sense of imagination while he grounds the visual look with a meticulous attention to historic detail.While it has some good action scenes, it's not an adventure epic in the mold of, say Indiana Jones, but one steeped in authenticity, more so, and actual real life probably went a little slower than you're used to seeing in movies, so be patient with it cause it is a very worthwhile and moving story.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I can look at grass puddles and English country manor gardens at home! I went to Queen Elizabeths Grammar school in Alford, Lincolnshire, the same one as Captain John Smith went to, so i know a lot about his life.

"A masterpiece (with reservations) and amazingly, a true story","I have been a fan of Malicks esoteric films since seeing Badlands over 30 years ago. I was greatly looking forward to this although I thought I knew pretty much what to expect for better and worse (particularly after the Thin Red Line) and so it proved to be. Stunning photography, good acting, a decent story told at a (very) leisurely pace and long shots of flora and fauna with birds squawking. These comments may seem a little cynical but this is what you get. Good points: Fabulous photography. The arrival of the English settlers to this New World is very well portrayed and the reaction of the locals to these aliens and visa versa convincing and plausible. The appearance and customs of the Indians Â– opps! - Native Americans is convincing (to me at least) and wonderfully strange. The experiences and adventures undertaken by the central character of Pocahontas is sensitively and movingly portrayed Â– the acting of Q'Orianka Kilcher was very impressive. Her turn to experience a 'New World' also comes in due course, when she travels to England and meets the King and Queen. Again, her wonder of the strangeness of this environment is convincing and moving. The recreation of 17th century Merrie Olde England is well done although oddly brief, particularly given the pace of the story up to this point. Bad points: Well, I like beautiful pictures as much as the next man and make no mistake, this is a beautiful film to watch but I did get restless seeing shots of a bird flying over a river for the umpteenth time. The voices-over as the characters wrestle with their inner demons I found a little tedious also. Yes, I know Malick teaches philosophy but I'm not convinced that this technique adds much to our knowledge of the motivation of the characters and often sounds pretentious. The fact is that the first two-thirds or thereabouts of the movie is too long and would have benefited from having 30 minutes snipped off. As previously stated, the trip to England and the consequent climatic events move at almost too brisk a pace (maybe relating to budget Â– I assume very expensive to create crowd scenes in a convincing 17th century environment?). The movie then ends rather suddenly. One aspect which is fascinating and I suspect may not be appreciated by all viewers is that the story is true. The essentials concerning the story of Pocahontas, Captain Smith and John Rolfe are largely accurate as best as can be judged from the detailed documented accounts from the period, including the presentation of the 'Indian Princess' to King James and Queen Anne. I greatly admire Malicks work Â– he paints a large and ambitious canvas. The artistic and cinematic quality of The New World is beyond dispute and it is in literally a different league from most of the trash that passes for cinema currently. Terrence just needs some decent scissors and an editor that can argue the case for steady and consistent pacing and plot development. And maybe a few less squawking birds next timeÂ…Â…Â…..",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Bad Film,"Listen, I am going to tell you a story. Oh, look, a flock of birds. Oh, a sunset. Now where was I. Oh, yes, a story. One about missed expectations, incredible durations, chopped and incoherent editing, stone-cold acting. Oh, look, Jonathan Pryce. Oh, look, tall grass. Oh, look, the back of someone's neck. Now where was I. Oh, yes, I was just saying that this film doesn't go anywhere, while trying and failing to attain too many goals. It loses itself into the worst editing job I have ever seen, and goes on for hours... Hey, did you just see this spider. Look, some mossy bark. Hey, a close-up on a flower. Where was I again. Oh yes, Colin Farrell still is undoubtedly one of the worst actors ever, not providing us with a single glimpse of what ""emotion"" means in such a long film. There's probably but two different facial expressions displayed during over two hours of film. Hey, look, another sunset. Did you just see that tree? Where was I. Historical inaccuracies and anachronisms galore, the filmmakers, although they proudly announce at the beginning of the film that it is set in 1607, do not take account of this a single minute. Hey look, tall grass. Oh, look, a woman's face in close-up. Hey, look at the clouds while we try to make you confused a little bit more. One example: Mozart (lifetime 1756-1791). Okay, his music is heard several times throughout the film, a music that has been written for emotions and feelings felt more than 150 years later. Colin Farrell's body is covered with tattoos, which make absolutely no sense since he was a colonist, and it is yet another element that breaks one viewer's good intentions of focusing on the film, and on believing in the filmmakers' good will. Did I say that James Horner's soundtrack is nothing else than a few blokes making the same three notes and the same loud sounds with horns for two hours? Hey, look, yet again some tall grass. Hey, look, Colin Farrell has an earring, cause he's such a cool 1607 colonist. Hey, look, all of them have ultra-brite teeth, and we swear to god, it IS 1607! They just had toothpaste back then, didn't you know? But hey, look at some grass while they're still looking for a decent screenplay. Ah, too bad, they didn't find one. They're just going to do some pretentious voice-overs to make it look like a Jean-Luc Godard or a Marguerite Duras film, whoa, all they had to do is tell the story of Pocahontas, maybe it wasn't as easy as it sounds (yeah right), but why did they think Godard-style voice-overs would have brought the film any interest? Oh, wow, look at that spider. Are you still thinking it's a bad film? Now just take another look at that sunset then. It's the title of the film for Pete's sake, ""The New World"", that's what you came here to see, so it has to have sunsets right? You didn't come here to see ""The Good Film"" or ""The Intense Acting"" or ""The Screenplay with Words in it"" or ""The Director Who Actually Directs and Doesn't Think He's Hot S#!&"". Now did you just see this amazingly tall grass? TALL GRASS! I REPEAT: TALL GRASS FOR ANYONE TO SEE, AT THE CINEMAS AROUND THE WORLD, FOR JUST A FEW DOLLARS. Wow. ""Mother, who am I?"" say the voice-overs. ""Mother, what is love"". ""Mother, what time is it?"" ""Mother, why the hell did I accept to be part of that pretentious and empty film?"" Hey look, a pink flamingo. The special effects are also amazing: the special effects guys successfully erased the National Geographic watermark from each frame of the film. I'm sure Colin Farrell's x-rated video was better-acted than this. Oh, here comes Christian Batman, here to save Pocahontas from Cap'n Crunch with his long hair. Hey, look, natives depicted as if they used to look and behave like animals. Absurd and insulting. Hey, look, absolutely no respect whatsoever for anyone in the cinema. Or for anyone whose life-story is being narrated on screen. Hey, look, a flock of birds, but not the same birds, new birds! ""Mother, why did I pay 5 euros to go see that film?"", oh no, that wasn't one of the voice-overs, that was me, sorry. At a crucial moment of the film, Pocahontas says ""I'm sorry"". Look at that. Amazingly blank dialogs all throughout, totally dull and pointless. ""Mother, what is this film about? -Aflock of birds my dear"". Oh, look, the 1607 man that's so evolved and cool is chewing on grass, so cool. Oh, Batman and Pocahontas have a baby now. Hey look, it rains again, marvelous, stupefying, the people who made this film so respect their audience. Oh, look, a music piece by Wagner (lifetime 1813-1883), grand isn't it, how music travels back in time. Maybe Mallick's next film will be about cavemen and prehistorical romance between a tattooed Colin Farrell with bright teeth and a flock of birds. Music by Eminem cause it's so cool and accurate ya know. But I wouldn't say Colin Farrell has that much of an acting range to play a caveman. I tried to write this review in the same way T. Mallick directed his film. Hope it helped anyone realize how confuse it is, how remotely cinematographic it is... there's better to do than watch this. Go see ""Mission"" again. Or ""The Last of the Mohicans"". Beautiful films. Forget Mallick.",2.0,Anonymous,History
The best at what he does,"Terrence Malick is one of those directors that has created a genre of film-making, and he is best at it. Many indie filmmakers today attempt to imitate his style, but are unsuccessful (I am thinking in particular of David Gordon Green and ""Undertow"", a film produced by Malick). He is a master of visual poetry. Nearly every person that liked this film mentions the astonishing visuals, and they are perfectly justified. This film is lovely. I don't think that each scene is as tightly constructed as in a Hitchcock film. For Malick the Gestalt is more important that the individual scene. This film is very impressionistic. I cannot note any specific scene that stood out to me. The compilation of scenes is what gives the film substance. Malick is a very naturalistic filmmaker. He is more interested in how his characters interact with nature and how nature interacts with the characters. The narrative is not the main objective, that is why the narrative is highly corrugated. One of the aspects of the film I liked the best was the voice over narration. That is something that has stuck me about all of his films. It is not tightly connected to the narrative. It is on another level, and yet it has everything to do with the narrative. Sometimes it seems superfluous and pretentious, but most of the time it is very provocative. You have to think about it since it is perpendicular to the narrative. This is not Malick's best film. That honor goes to ""Badlands"", his first. But this film is very good.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Bad dialog, music, acting (at times). Good costumes.","Horrible music. The annoying opening ""discovery"" music which is played anytime there is a new ""discovery"" really grates on one's nerves. It's one harmony crescendoed, that's it, and the so called composer for this movie didn't even write it! And then there is the theme from one of Mozart's piano concertos, a 40 second clip only, which was heard 5-6 times throughout the movie in the most predictable places. Most people who watch this movie and complement the composer do not realize did not write most of the music used in this movie.The dialog, as is in almost all so called blockbusters these days is clichÃ©d. The director used too many shots of the young actress giving us her wonderful smile, used to show her innocence and purity and gaiety. This got old very quickly. We get the point, move on.The people who say it was beautifully shot do not get out enough into nature or watch any nature documentaries on TV. There is really nothing new here that the director gives that you can't get elsewhere in real life or not. If you want to see breathtaking beautifully shot movies then you need to check out Werner Herzog's stuff w/Kinski or Akira Kurosawa to see how it's really done.There is rampant clichÃ©d symbolism such as the bird flying into the sky at the end. I was unaware of the story of Pocahontas, but nevertheless, this story was quite predictable and the emotions of the main characters obvious at all times and predictable. I could go on and on like this movie did, but alas. See it if you want to pat yourself on the back when you're done and curse the philistines who ""don't get it"" or feed whatever superiority complex you may have.Costumes were pretty good, however, it was obvious the studio was going for a PG-13 rating to maximize their profits (although we got a nice glance at Pocahontas' right butt cheek at one point). The battle scenes were a letdown as well due to the studio's desired rating. This could have been a much better film if the director was allowed more realism.",1.0,Anonymous,History
What a great tribute to the early settlers.,"This was a wonderful film with plenty of emotions. The art work and scenery was fantastic. The introduction of the early settlers made me awaken to the hardships and sacrifices made by both the natives and Englishmen. I adore the actress who played Pocohantas starring ""Q'orianka Kilcher"". This actress is a one of a kind. She can move your heart and bring you to tears without saying a word. How refreshing to find a young actress who is worthy of an Oscar at her young age of 15. I will say this movie is excellent I watched it over and over and still I would love to watch it again. Please take the time to watch the making of the film provided on the DVD. It was very interesting how the finding of the characters were done.

Dissenter,"First off, I know I'm going to get lambasted for this rating. Let me start by saying that the acting, cinematography and production values were all top notch. But frankly, the movie flowed like one of my high school history papers. 15 pages of flowery garbage that could have been done succinctly in about one paragraph to half a page. The wind blowing, the scenery, they were both beautifully done. But seriously, do we need to watch still water and rain drops falling on a pond for an hour? Just how interesting is tree bark? How much thought have you given to the enthralling qualities of grass growing? The silence may have been revolutionary and ""artsy,"" but frankly it just added to the complete and utter boredom that was apparent in everyone, save the elderly who were already asleep, in the theater. And better yet, when the characters DID speak, they mumbled inaudible noises disguised as the English language.It literally pained me to watch this movie. I reached a point where I questioned my existence and why I was still in the theater, when clearly I could have been studying, working out, cleaning, doing ANYTHING productive. There were 3 separate occasions where I believed (and was truly grateful) that the movie was over...unfortunately, I was wrong. Dead wrong. the sole reason for keeping me in that seat was the fact that I had already invested $8. It was the principle of it.Once again, I'm sure that this movie will win a large number of awards, and it deserves to win some of them. There are two things I look for in a movie: 1. Entertainment value, 2. Epiphanies. As far as entertainment value, this movie gets a large THUMB DOWN. This was undoubtedly one of the most boring pieces of ""art"" that I have ever witnessed. As for epiphanies, no. This movie has not changed my life, or philosophy in life at all. Nor has it given me any new perspectives on concepts I already thought about. All this movie did for me was waste my $8.Even though it's only about 2.5 hours, my mind felt like it was 10. I feel as though I lost more brain cells watching this movie than I would have had I sat about 1 in from a nuclear reactor going critical. This movie may be appealing to some who have a vastly different set of priorities than I (and the vast majority of the viewing public), but overall, I wouldn't even use this movie to hold up an uneven coffee table.

Historical revisionism and Indian paganism = A New World Flop,"This movie was a field of [...]! What do I mean? ....It is a mixture of historical revisionism, New Age Indian paganism, Jungian psycho-analysis, and the Hollywood idol of naturalistic romanticism woven together into a twisted attempt to portray the life of Pocahantas. This was definitely not The New World and the founding of Jamestown! This was a New Age pagan view of the life of Pocahantas. The script was completely ludicrous and unhistorical, almost a dream world of stupid and silly comments about a supposed love relationship between John Smith and the Indian Princess Pocahantas. I think only illiterate queebs and brainless crack heads could have been at all pleased by the lack of serious conversation, dialogue and character development in this movie. Anyway, this twisted and romanticized version of John Smith and Pocahantas has now become a common lie and fabrication repeated by the historical idiots and ignoramuses in Hollywood. It is actually turning into some kind of Hollywood cult folklore! I suppose the Disney version was probably more entertaining, even though it was just as stupid and perverse! There is not a single factually true or even historically plausible conversation throughout this entire movie, or the Disney version for that matter. Why don't these Hollywood directors and producers ever read history??? I suppose it is their hostile New Age paganism and hatred of real American history. The movie moreover portrays the English settlers as being a bunch of dirty, filthy, confused, and violent hooligans who come to invade the Paradise of the innocent Indians. What a load of [...]! The movie therefore tries to gloss over the barbaric and savage perversities of the Indians and even tries to make them seem virtuous and innocent. More Hollywood paganism! Even the music though was ridiculously out of place. A slow movement from a well known Mozart piano concerto written in the 1780's and a piece from the German Romantic Richard Wagner's Das Rheingold written in the 1860's was a stupid and brainless idea. What was James Horner thinking here? Mozart, 19th century German Romanticism, oh yes, then glazed over with a touch of 20th century American minimalism all scored to supposedly portray the New World Discovery and the founding of Jamestowne???? I have no idea what makes these Hollywood producers such brainless [...]! In the early 17th century, Thomas Tallis, William Byrd, and John Dowland were the famous English composers!!! Don't they know that??? It would have been much better and honorable and historically accurate if Horner had included such music into the score. And what about the cinematography? So what? I can watch the travel channel! All in all, this movie is a terrible flop, a cinematic load of [...] - very similar to the pile of [...] that John Rolfe and Pocahantas are portrayed (late in the movie) as having to trudge through on their way back to the house. This is exactly what I was feeling as I was watching this movie, that I was trudging through a field of [...]! Now I have to go and clean off my shoes.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Different and breathtaking.,"It was a so exciting film for me. First of all, it was so different from the other films which were in the cinema at the same time. It was based on images and sounds, not words. However it could tell me what it wants to tell. I felt it under my skin through my veins. The story was familiar but i have never felt it like this before. In addition, it was not only a girl's story, but it was also a nation's, a ""new world""'s story. The people who came to see a war or some action were bored and most of audiences left the cinema before ending because film was quite slow and long. Acting was interesting, you will see that many people you do not expect very much will surprise you.

Terrence Malik the magic man.,"Terrence Malik can pull so much from every frame, nuance after nuance. So much can be told in an instant. I think that is a beautiful thing. Most raw in it's portrayal of the fight for survival of the first Jamestown settlers against themselves, disease and indigenous people, but able to find it's simple truth, with the use of a simple, but stunningly beautiful Indian girl and the two men she loved. If you can get past the American idea that cinema should be about wall to wall talk about some over drenched plot, this film may teach you something.

"Pretentious, boring, entirely pointless rehash of the Pocahontas story","The New World is a movie about the first settlers in North America, their interactions with natives, and the girl who became famous as Pocahontas.It is a movie about all of these things - but is it a story? Dreamy, slow, and artistic, it often does not present a coherent story to the viewer. Lengthy sequences of dream like silent shots with a bit of music dominate much of the film. If you have seen Thin Red Line, this film will feel very familiar. Only where Thin Red Line used its device to alienate the audience from war, this film tries to alienate us from the process of colonisation. Or rather, it tries to depict the arrival of the British in North America as a giant rape of something pure, pristine, natural and virginal. Idealized descriptions of natives as utopian, idyllic people are completely out of touch with their depiction as tribe. For instance, we are told how deception, jealousy and ownership are alien concepts to these natural people, except of course they are fiercely territorial, spy on the British and aren't nearly as noble as John Smith perceives them.The constant narration of characters' thoughts is irritating and out of synch with the plot. Yes, it is exactly like Thin Red Line in that regard, but to be honest, it barely worked in that film, and using the same device here results in overkill: One pseudo-poetic artsy pretentious film using this trick is more than enough.Just as Thin Red Line heavily plugged the brief appearance of George Clooney in its trailers and promotional materials, The New World resorts to a very eye catching, dramatic, action-packed DVD cover here in Britain. It tries to sell itself as dramatic, beautiful action film, which is clearly misleading. This is not an action film. What little action there is, is not original, inventive or beautifully dramatic, but bland and boring and confusing.In terms of its acting performances, Christian Bale, Colin Farrell and Christopher Plummer all do reasonably well, without ever needing to be outstanding. The entire film rests on the shoulders of Q'Orianka Kilcher. She does her job very well. That said, the film is incredibly obsessed with her, and especially obsessed with trying to depict her as a playful, lively child of nature at first (and depressed and abandoned broken child later on). The audience is clearly supposed to fall in love with her. If there had been less voice-over of her (and everyone else's) thoughts, it might just have succeeded. But sadly, the film ends up feeling like a very shallow, teenage romance - like Romeo and Juliet on a new continent.The New World is really only for a small niche audience. If you like your films pretentious and wannabe poetic, slightly abstract and dreamy, without much empathy for the characters and with a very shallow obsession with a pretty teenage girl, you will probably like The New World. Otherwise, you might want to give it a miss.",,Anonymous,History

I'm not an expert on the clothing and culture of North America at the time, but I seriously doubt that the women would have been too concerned to cover their breasts. But of course American audiences are concerned to cover those breasts, regardless of how this subverts everything else that has been done by the film-makers to create a superior sense of period authenticity. I realize that some of you are going to accuse me of simply being a perv who wants to ogle womens' breasts (perv? that's a different discussion) or a nit picker who will allow a seemingly minor point to detract from his enjoyment of an otherwise excellent film by a great director.

His Finest,"Easily the most artful film of 2005, and the crowning jewel of Malick's career. I though he had permanently outdone himself with The Thin Red Line, but this is a more focused, affecting film than its predecessor. This is the closest I've ever felt to *watching* fine literature or poetry on film. If you have an open, patient mind, you will be richly rewarded.Others have commented on the sluggishness of the film, or on Malick's over-reliance on natural footage to fill in for storytelling and characterization. I think there is a fine line of ambiguity in symbolism. Malick walks this line like a world class trapeze artist. Every time I watch this film, I come away with new layers of interpretation.

The rest is Colin Farrell and Pocahontas hugging each other in the grass smiling narrating rhetorical questions in their minds that get pretty annoying. Now I bet there are some art students out there reading this who are just dying to reply to this by saying, ""YOU Don't UNDERSTAND ART!"" - well, if more than half the people watching this garbage left the theatre I was in, that's got to mean something.

Kilcher excelled,"Definitely an experience, I was reluctant to watch this film because of all of the backlash even knowing that I have a soft spot for Malick's pieces, however I loved its pacing, the daring decisions he usually takes storywise, the bold camera work. And in that, The New World proved to be no different than his other works.For me, the first part of the story was shot in the best way posible, allowing us as audience to feel immerse in every shot, the camera work manages to let us feel included in the characters' points of view. Lubezki showed us the level of craftsmanship he has in himself. Q'orianka Kilcher achieved an engaging and powerful portrayal, now I cannot imagine this film without her. Lastly, the use of music was exquisite as well.Basically, the only issue I have is not with the film itself, but with the source material, I cannot trust the conquistadores' point of view to be accurate and as tender in real life, but we'll never know, but for me is just common sense, colonialism was never respectful, nor gentle, nor even thoughtful in its approach.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Without Compromise,"I am sincerely befuddled that any serious devotee of cinema can find a significant blemish in the construction of this film. Obviously, his sense of movement and characterization require a certain tolerance for abstraction, but I have rarely seen art in any medium come so close to perfection. All of Malick's cinematic work has been masterful, yet without any doubt his prowess and technique have only blossomed further with each additional effort. Thoroughly, I respect the impatience of many viewers and the subsequent lack of interest regarding the film's exposition and mechanics. However, it is important to differentiate and qualify the criticism of those who are unable to maintain focus from those who actively commit to the experience. Malick will never be as traditionally engaging as more entertainment-oriented directors, but this notion holds no sway over the quality present in his work; the supreme control with which he commands his faculties is astounding and permeates every aspect of ""The New World"". In fact, when considering the level of detail inherent in the film's production it is impressive how naturalistic the film appears. Generally artists lose important aspects of expression in the cultivation of execution, which thereby results in a lack of warmth and soul; thankfully, Malick is seemingly immune to this affliction and created his most intimate and gentle film yet. Other great directors like Kubrick and Lynch have wrestled with the same inverse proportionality in their films. However, both of these men opted to utilize this human detachment for a more disassociated perspective, whereas Malick maintains balance through subtly incisive introspection. It is this delicate thread of understated reflection that binds all elements of his craft into a tapestry of unmatched beauty. The screenplay is simply poetic. I recommend the use of subtitles to those with the inability to hear, or perhaps listen. Attentiveness is paramount. The film is ultimately a soft-spoken essay in perception, revolving around the juxtaposition of culture: co-existence, conquest, and the journey between natural and human order. Deceptively enough, all this is packaged in the context of a historical romance revolving around Pocahontas and her pair of European suitors. Nevertheless, it still succeeds in being one of the better statements concerning love, regret, and the embrace of life ever artificially produced. The design elements and performances committed to film are astounding and the cinematography and editing are unmatched in the pantheon of contemporary American cinema. Ostensibly, this film is a barrage of intricately tempered sight and sound. For admirers of Malick these traits are to be expected, but many casual movie-watchers may understandably find the more overtly poetic elements of the production to be detrimental and irreconcilably distracting. The film is undeniably nebulous with an abstract narrative structure and a disorienting pace, but given careful attention and most likely repeat viewings ""The New World"" will reveal itself in its true form: a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,History
abysmal in almost all respects,"I give this movie a 2 instead of a 1 only because I found it somewhat visually appealing. Costumes, ships, the river, the sunsets all very nice to look at.Beyond this, I found the storyline completely lacking. Colin Farrell spent most of the movie looking like a wounded puppy, although sometimes he looked bewildered just to spice it up some. Q'Orianka Kilcher might have been amazing, but mostly the writers had her dancing in the grass and looking good without saying or doing much. What the writers seemed to think was character development amounted to little other than inane banalities. No one else, including Pocahontas' husband had any development whatsoever.I spent the last hour of the movie praying that each scene would be the last.

Incoherent Art,"While I applaud the historical authenticity of the film - the situations, sets, costumes, language & cultural characterizations were excellent - I found it to be an incoherent mess which started out chaotically and by mid-film, had become very slow, completely boring & pointless.After a brief promising start (and excellent work by Christopher Plummer), the film starts jumping all over the place with no sense of time or space. If this was an attempt at conveying the chaos & uncertainty of a strange situation in a strange land, it succeeded, but it was, in my opinion, lousy storytelling. Looked like the editor was on PCP. Or something.While it was interesting to hear the native dialog in the proper tongue, after Smith learns the language and could presumably understand them, it would have been nice if we've been treated the same. Subtitling, while appropriately absent at first, should have been used more often later. Often, it was just too difficult to tell what was going on. And it's not very interesting to hear long exchanges of dialog when the actions give you no clue as to what's happening.Colin Farrell was wasted. He spent 90% of the film with one expression on his face - looking very worried. One gets the impression that director Terrence Malick said, ""look very worried, Colin"", and left it at that. In the first 30 minutes of the film, he had perhaps 8 lines of dialog. In fact, in the rest of the film, he didn't say much more.Q'Orianka Kilcher was a joy to behold, and conveyed innocence, vulnerability & childish playfulness beautifully, but how many times can you watch her gesticulating at the sun & walking through fields? Malick apparently couldn't get enough of it.The portrayal of the military actions was laughable. As a 17th century historical re-enactor, I was cheered when I saw them form up with pike & musket (if somewhat shambolically) to face the ""naturals"" outside the fort. But after presenting a wall of pikes, and sending one line of musketeers forwards to fire (with none in reserve for the second volley - which is basic stuff in this era), instead of getting the musketeers to retire & reload whilst the pikes covered the front, for some reason everyone suddenly ran forward in all directions, and got done over as they deserved to do for being so stupid. For Pete's sake! If you're going to run all over the place, it defeats the purpose of having a formation in the first place. Duh.I guess I'm not a fan of Malick's films. I thought The Thin Red Line one of the worst war (or war-setting) films I have ever seen. In that one, we had similar military nonsense - the Japanese, deadly crack shots who never miss at a distance of 2 miles, apparently cannot hit a single one of dozens of Americans running at them from 30 yards away. Maybe they weren't trained that way. When there was no shooting, everyone just whined.But back to The New World.

Love and Hate,"I really liked this movie a lot. First off, this is an ""art-house movie"". Most movies done like this are rarely given a blockbuster size budget to make, but this one did. All the performances are excellent, the cinematography is astounding, and although it may seem a bit slow at times, its perfect. Yes, there probably was some historical inaccuracies. But with all the mystery surrounding the relationship between Capt. Smith and ole' Poky, its a perfect opportunity for an interpreted story. I've seen this movie on two separate occasions, sober...and high. When I was high this movie made me cry...it did.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Get Lost There,"I love this dreamy, romanticized story of John Smith (Colin Farrell) and Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher). It is amazing how they built the fort and Indian village by hand, in the manner in which they were originally built, just 10 miles away from the original location of Jamestown, in Virginia. If you like history and romance, you will probably dig it. If you fell asleep in school, you may find it boring. If you are interested in America's original inhabitants, you may find it intellectually stimulating. If you think Colin Farrell looks absolutely cool when he smiles shyly, instead of being the tough guy all of the time, you will enjoy watching him. If you enjoy the lyrical cinematography of Terrence Mallick, you will be all over it. That is what I think.Ta, Sheshetta",10.0,Anonymous,History
pretty scenery,"The New World is about Captain Smith and Pocahontas, how they came to meet and fall in love. The hard times the first settlers of Virginia had and how they eventually rile dup the Indians. How Pocahontas married Rolfe and then discovered Smith was still alive. If you're looking for fast pace and action, go somewhere else. If you're looking for a dramatization of certain aspects of historical events, then this is for you. There was a great deal of narration rather than dialog. I guess you could say it was a touching film, but the females in my family didn't particularly like it.

Somehow I just love this movie,"Reading the reviews, I can tell this movie wasn't popular with the average movie-goer, and I can't really blame them or expect them to agree with me. So, maybe this is a very personal review, but I found this movie very pleasing to my taste. I enjoy movies that are soft and calm. It's very calming and stress-reducing. And I love the way it was edited to show her transition from innocent child-likeness to womanhood. I thought the editing was brilliant because it moved along at a slow but continual pace, like the river so often shown in the movie. But most of all, I loved the interaction between the actors, especially Q'Orianka. She's so hauntingly beautiful and mesmerizing. I wish this movie could have gotten more love because I feel so alone in my love for it. But for now, I'll continue to enjoy it on my own and treasure it as one of my favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,History
How on Earth is this a good movie?,"I'll start off with good comments. This movie had an amazing feel to it. It looked absolutely beautiful and had some of the best cinematography that I have seen.But here's the true problem with the story. It had no real continuity and reminded me too much of the cheap independent films I've seen at film festivals. I could never identify with any of the characters and never felt much sympathy for any of them accept Pocahontas. This movie seemed more like a stage play than an actual movie. The actors didn't really seem convincing in their roles. The natives seemed more like Puerto Ricans than natives. It's like the makers of this movie have no idea of the concept of plot structure.My girlfriend passed out from boredom while watching this movie, and I almost joined her. I actually like movies that start out slow and build their plot and characters (like you're supposed to). But this movie never got going. I never saw a point to it. Maybe I'm just too shallow, but I thought this movie was dreadful.",3.0,Anonymous,History
The New World setting New Bars for Movie Making,"The New World is an epic, historical and biographical drama of Pocahontas' (Q'Orianka Kilcher) life, her two worlds, and the people in it. The film is set in 17th Century Virginia, spanning the first meeting between the Algonquin people and the English settlers, till the end of Pocahontas' life. In Terence Malick (The Thin Red Line) style, the film doesn't conform to the pace of conventional Hollywood plots. So if you can't handle deviation from Hollywood, you might want to avoid this film.However, those who persist will be rewarded. Gliding slowly across the surface of the river, Malick takes his time to draw you into his world of wild, natural and palpable beauty, with his visually meditative style, as you slowly lose your sense of being in a cinema. The authenticity of sight and sound (the set built only a distance from the actual site, the minute details of nature's sounds in the background, and the use of natural lighting only) gives a sense of reality unlike any other film I have seen.We experience the genuine connection and heartache of Pocahontas and John Smith's forbidden relationship, the loss of a kindred way of life, the displacement of her people, and her uneasy assimilation into, a less carefree, Western society. Here, she adopts a Christian name, learns to see the world through different eyes, and understands a different kind of love, with the stable and abiding John Rolfe (Christian Bale). Through all, she never forgets her roots, and displays the resilience of the character we have all come to know as Pocahontas.The casting of 14-year-old Q'Orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas was particularly refreshing. The combination of her unconventional beauty, childlike sincerity, and ""old-soul"" maturity is most unique, and apt to embody the emotional journeys of the young heroine. Colin Farrell, in my opinion, lacked a degree of sincerity in his acting and delivered a passable performance. Christian Bale, in his relatively smaller role as John Rolfe, gives a convincing performance that was understated and natural.As the character, John Rolfe, describes Pocahontas, ""Â…she weaves all things togetherÂ…"", so this film weaves the themes of harmony with nature, displacement, commitment, love, loss, hope and life. It leaves audiences feeling expanded with the vastness of all the feelings we are capable of feeling as human beings. I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A new different world....,"A consistent theme adopted by movie makers over decades has been showing the differences that exist amongst people, places, cultures, religions, or families and tug at the heart strings based on that emotion that all of us realize sadly exists, even in extreme forms, in the world we live in.The New World takes this up a notch. The discovery of an entirely new world has been depicted both in the mildness and violence that humanity shows to itself.John Smith (Farrel) is an English captain who arrives on the coast Virginia in 1607 to lay the frontier of the new world. The interaction with the 'Naturals' (or savages as they are sometimes referred to) and eventual fall of grace from their view has been well pictured. Smith falls in love with the daughter of the powerful local king - Pocahontas (Q'Orianka Kilcher in a breakthrough role) who risks her life to beg to save Smith's. But, the dream of love and the time spent in 'captivity' of the Naturals soon ends when Smith is returned to his post. His sense of duty and honor (which is all so subtly depicted - kudos to director Malick on that count!)calls over his understanding of Natives and his love for Pocahontas. Bloodshed follows.The Conquest of America, as one may call it, had a very humble beginning. The following generation would ensure that greater tracts of land were conquered along with the near destruction of an astounding culture, who had learned to be one with the senses of nature, was complete.Giving into the greater calling of duty Smith leaves Pocahontas and spurned by her people she is taken captive by the English. She rediscovers love, and eventually understands life seen through a different prism, with John Rolfe (Bale in a very sedated role).The movie managed to achieve a rare mix of (the John Smith-Pocahontas) legend and reality. Amazing concept. Real performances. It must make it one of the best movies of the year, but sadly it just doesn't. Where it falters is where director Malick has been said to have taken the most time on - editing and continuity.Most of the story and screenplay are thrown in as background (as in commentary or observations by the characters) while adopting the technique of actors show reality of the minute they are engaged in, rather than carry the story forward with their actions. While this is a very novel way of moving the story forward - one does not become attached to any of the characters because they have not 'done' anything on screen to contribute to the story. All their decisions, actions and thoughts leading to major points in the plot are kept out of the view. And this brings in a sense of slowness to the movie, despite the fact that there is a lot of story that has been told (and personally, I felt the length was right considering the volume of story told).I am an adherent admirer of filmmakers trying different ways of telling stories to the audience, but as is the case with most things in life, some forms work better than the other. Christopher Nolan (Memento) achieved it in breathtaking style, but Spielberg (War of the Worlds)- not so much. While Malick's attempt is worth applauding, it quite simply didn't make the cut for this story.6 stars/ 10.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"Cinematography certainly is good, but story handled poorly","The characters were not well developed and there was entirely too much walking around, looking at the ground and not enough dialogue to maintain audience interest. Over fifty people walked out of the theater before the movie was half over. The music in spots was out of place and became irritating. The acting was mediocre, at best. There was much Indian conversation and so few subtitles, one had a hard time understanding what was going on. So little historical information was given, one had to work way too hard to figure out the plot. A great concept for a story, but not handled as well as it might have been. Not a movie I would recommend to anyone. The reviews I read left me confused as to whether or not the reviewers actually saw the movie. The one complement I can offer is that there was no profanity or explicit sex and that was refreshing.",2.0,Anonymous,History
A FEAST FOR YOU EYES AND EARS,"A visually gorgeous film telling a story of love, conquest and fear. ""The New World"" has a pace all it's own and is a tad longer than the average film fare. This simple historically based story is like a leaf floating on a stream. Sometimes the leaf travels fast in swirling eddies and sometimes it moves gently, almost coming to a temporary pause. The music holds you throughout the film, the acting, costumes and make-up are exceptionally authentic and the direction gives the audience a Zen-like experience that provides a journey that has no map and is not concerned with how it gets to the end. Americans are so trained to watch 2 hour movies with a beginning, middle and end and one hour TV dramas that must conclude the mystery before the last 60 second commercial. If Hollywood audience training failed on you, you will find yourself immersed in the beauty of the natural world while experiencing a film about life, love and loss.

I Could Not Get into This,"Sorry, I just did not get into this movie. Not a movie, a poem, as another reviewer wrote, maybe more of a documentary. Something is not right with this movie---it is like watching a filmstrip in elementary school. I found it long winded, rather dull, boring. It is difficult to understand the mumblings of the characters. The Hollywood makeup of the ""naturals"" was evident. The casting was all right, I guess, but I just found myself waiting for it to be all over already. The scene where Pocahontas (and funny, she is never called Pocahontas in the movie---who would know if they were not familiar with her story?) is dressed in English finery is very realistic. Not so are the tattoos on Farrell's arms. Again, it is a visual masterpiece, but I just could not get into it, and readily see why it failed miserably. Not a go here.

Natureza,"This is another Malick film in which the nature of man and nature of God are confronted. The suffering and ambition of men who destroy the purity and sincerity of a free people. This is not a war movie. It's a movie of God and men. Terrence Malick is a master at deciphering the deepest human anxieties and questions. The philosophy of life, especially life connected to nature is his context, and God is his quest. His films are always for me a reason for great reflection about my life and my motivations. This is not a movie to mediocre audiences, which, unfortunately, are the majority.

A beautiful clash of civilizations,"The saga of European colonization of the Americas is epic and dramatic in and of itself. The New World, by acclaimed auteur Terrence Malick tells the story of the English arrival at Virginia and the conflict between John Smith and his men and the native people led by Powhatan.There is definitely a spiritual air to the work as with most of Malick's films, and the point of view seems to be from the position of the natives, as the cinematography is very awe-inspiring and dazzling giving the experience of seeing something new to the viewer.The fierce violence and seriousness of the interactions between the English and natives is interspersed with touching romance between John Smith and the princess Pocahontas. Malick's romantic side shines brightly and the lovers story takes off swiftly.The identity of the characters is a key theme in the film, and with John Smith's capture by the natives and Pocahontas' conversion to Christianity, identities fluctuate to and fro with the underlying humanity of the characters providing a solid groundwork.The film is excellent, and beautiful artistic interpretation of the events of the colonization of Early America. Fans of Malick will recognize his wide-angle shots and off-screen narration. Those not familiar with Malick will still enjoy this film as a solid work.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Gotta Love Terrence Malick!,"When you watch enough movies like I have, you will have the ability to tell who directed a movie just based off cinematography and visuals. I could tell right away this is a Terrence Malick film thanks to his wonderful, stunning visuals portrayed in The New World. This movie can be a little long and the script doesn't seem to be that sharp, but Malick's direction and above-average acting makes this a wonderful history lesson to behold.This film is the true story of the Pocahontas legend. This story tells the story of how the early colonists landed in Jamestown and one them, John Smith forges a relationship with one of the natives that will change their lives.This film is acted very well. Colin Farrell doesn't get the recognition he deserves especially when he stars in films like this. We don't see Christian Bale until the later part of the movie but he has a nice, toned-down performance unlike his Batman film which came out the same year.Overall, this is a film just worth seeing for it's majestic beauty. It's almost a crime that it underperformed at the box office. This could have been a perfect movie thanks to the source material, but it is held down slightly by a weaker script than I expected and some choppy editing but all-in-all I was very pleased. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
started slow and boring turned good at the end,"I watched this movie like 4 months ago with a group of 4 which were: my Husband, friend , 11 year old daughter and me. It is true what people has said there are two options: you will love or hate it , no in between. I think it has to do with taste and what kind of person you are. After 40 minutes seeing it my husband says: This is a really boring and bad movie.And inside of me I said please don't let it be like the movie Tree of Life. My husband hated this last one because he hates slow paced movies, but even worse when there is almost no talking between characters.The problem is it does not have much talking, the movie is slow, and the speaking you hear in the movie are the mind of Collin Farell saying who am I, why am I here, does she love me , Do I love her, is this real love and things like that.But do not get discouraged for what I am saying it starts a little boring but near the middle end it gets good. It leaves a message and I liked it. And better then that is that it happened in real life with the real pocahontas .I give it 8 points because of the good ending and I mean because of the guy Pocahontas picks.I recommend seeing a movie called the 5 people you meet in heaven, this one has a very deep spiritual message and I am sure if you likes The New World you will also like the one I am recommending.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Historically realistic and intimately poetic at the same time,"Sorry but the prelude of 'Das Rheingold', this is Werner Herzog's Nosferatu forever to me. But Malick has the right, he is just as sublime here. The subject is fascinating in itself. The story is historically realistic and intimately poetic at the same time, which is a remarkable achievement. It's great to see the interactions between the natives and the settlers rendered in a natural, intimate and non-caricatural way.When I first saw the film in theatre, I was a bit annoyed with its precious pantheism: ""Come, spirit. Help us sing the story of our land. You are our mother; we, your field of corn. We rise from out of the soul of you,"" says Pocahontas in the first scene. After two hours, Malick had convinced me.

Even bored (and sometimes shocked) a historian.,"As a grad student specializing in colonial America, I was quite a bit surprised catching myself just about to fast forward through this movie (I bought it on Blu Ray even before having ever watched it). The extended version has 30 extra minutes, and yet the movie is at least an hour too long. Let's cut to the chase on what I loved:The architecture of Jamestown was amazing and the director's use of 360 degree shots is wonderful; these, coupled with breathtaking shots of nature that rivals those of top documentaries, I couldn't help wanting to keep watching the movie for more. You could really feel as if you were there.The problem is, that is ALL I had to keep me going. I won't dwell on the editing and storytelling, considering other reviewers covered this problem perfectly. However I might add I had to raise the volume a lot or even put on subtitles to understand what the characters were saying half the time. I have never seen a movie so obsessed with whispering. It's always psss pss pss here and mumble mumble there. Also, the fading in and out of the conversations for no reason was truly annoying. I never knew whether I was supposed to pay attention to what so or so was saying or not. Throughout the movie there is no clear indication on how the audience is supposed to participate or what they should concentrate on. It's a hopeless mess of random cuts, fades, and other ""artsy"" styles that are overused and kill any purpose they might have had being used sparingly.I'm not against nudity, but I do believe in purpose. What's with the random nude swimming women with no context whatsoever besides showing an underwater ass shot? And this shot is randomly flung throughout the movie as if the director is shouting, ""bored? Here's some ass to wake you up!""Back to the history aspect of the movie. (and I caution the reader I specialize rather in French colonialism, and so I can't talk about the events of Jamestown. Though I admit the movie does make me want to read up on it). Though I applaud the job made on Jamestown, the anthropology of the movie is questionable. The initial reaction of the natives upon seeing the ships for the first time angered me. The actors were told to jump around using a certain choreography which, frankly to put it bluntly, made them look like a bunch of angry monkeys looking at a far off banana. I found this view of sloping natives like a half-assed attempt to make them look primitive to the point of being cartoon cavemen. I question Pocahontas's costume which looks more like rags than actual native garment (I'd be curious to see what contemporary image they got that from). They boast in the behind the scenes documentary that they bothered planting primitive corn as it was grown back then (for people who don't know, 400 years ago corn looked more like wheat than what it is today after generations of selective gardening), and yet the main shot of the corn is Pocahontas picking modern corn... Despite the movie makers' claims of the opposite, these natives are indeed portrayed as the noble savage stereotype, in tune with nature. The reality of the matter is that natives never lived in harmony in nature. They survived in nature. There is a big difference. Other stereotypes are also present: I agree that one has to admit to the atrocities committed against natives, but showing Europeans as all being dumb brutes is still being caught up in stereotypes. And might I add captain Newport's comment (I'm paraphrasing) on not ruining America's first day sounds slightly anachronistic? And one final rant of annoyance: why does no one ever talk? I mean, sure you hear a few main characters talk, a few war whoops, but you can't ignore the fact that in the whole Jamestown settlement or the native village, background extra's walk around like a hoard of mutes told to walk straight with no purpose other than to remind us ""Oh, right, there's people living here"". This sticks out like a sore thumb.Final verdict: this movie was wasted potential.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"The Way Things Were: If You Have The Patience, Malick Has The Goods","I'd rather spend a few hours ambling in some isolated woods than the same time on a crowded city street; which might be the reason I admired the leisurely authenticity of much of this film, the immersion in a world lost the minute Europeans set out to add a new civilization.Yes, the conflict is over-simplified, and the pace of the film is often glacial, but so many of the images are lucidly brilliant, the character of the Indian princess quietly compelling and the detailing of the invasive community persuasive. The story is familiar, but the ecological sidebars attached by director Malick are not, and, even though this is a long look at more than two hours, the look at the natural world and the contrasting methods with which man utilizes it can be fascinating. Malick makes his own mark and the motive does not appear to be commercial. And good for him.",8.0,Anonymous,History
It's an art film so not much of a film to begin with anyway.,"It's all there: hazy dreamy cinematography, poetic monologues, entrancing music, random footage compilations, interpretive dance, performance art, improvisation acting ... this film neatly ticks of all the boxes on the checklist of 'Art Film Musts'. And that's great if you're into that. But predictably and unfortunately most of the general audience, including me, isn't.There's few conventional scenes in the film. Scenes where actual characters have meaningful conversations to drive the plot forward. Instead most of the film consists of endless successions of brief shots of nature, native Americans dancing and rituals, bizarre no-name characters doing what can only be described as interpretive dance or performance art, scenes that clearly look like the director just let the camera roll and told his actors ""to express their feeling and explore the space"". Everything drowned in a thick sauce of repetitive music and perpetual inner monologues.And oh boy, the monologues. Dear God the monologues. It's just endless drivel interjected in between every single sentence of every conversation that any number of characters are having. Sometimes it makes some vague sense most often it's a random bunch of sentences jumbled together. Especially Pocahontas' inner monologues are grating. Both in content and execution. One of my pet peeves in cinema is what I call whisper actors. There's whisper actors who think leaning forward, squinting their eyes and saying everything as an intense dramatic whisper accounts for ""good acting"". There a lot of those around in the industry. Q'oriana Kilcher (Pocahontas) however is an even worse kind of whisper actor. One who just lets the air fly from her lungs while barely moving an oral muscle. It's the sort of acting actors employ when they're trying to convey their character being completely lost in inner thoughts and feelings. At one point it even seemed like Pocahontas' inner monologue was interrupting her own inner monologue as she was mixing two different conversations in her head. Like a whisper being cut of by another random whisper. Allow me to paraphrase one of her inner monologues verbatim from the film:""l find joy in all I see. Where am I going? Mother. Fast. So fast. To go to him. The river. Living water. To meet him. Where does it come from? Where is it going?"" - The sort of musings you'll be listening to all film long. Seems like a bunch of gibberish you say? Trust me, when you see the monologue in the context of the scene ... you'll still think it's gibberish.The haziness, the music and the monologues combine into something that sedates your mind. You're not really immersed in the film but rather feel like you're catching distant glimpses of something through a thick fog.Then there's the excessive PDA. The first hour of the film consists of our two main characters laying in each other arms caressing each others' faces softly whispering pure cringe things like ""Are you real?"" and ""There is no other life then to be near you"". Their relationship is depicted as a sort of larger than life romance. A love for the ages. Two people who are so unfathomably in love us mere plebs couldn't come close to imagining how much they love each other. Problem is the film never shows us why. They just sort of become smitten all of a sudden.Any positives? Sure, the scenery, the vistas, the costumes and make-up are all exceptional. The films' core concept obviously speaks to the imagination: The clash of cultures that were so different they might as well have come from different planets. The mind starts to wonder once you see native Americans set foot in 17th century England and look around in bewilderment as every square meter consists of something they've never seen before in their lives: Wheels, carriages, horses, paved roads, Clean-cut stone bricks, glassware, cut grass, floor tiles ... The film definitely becomes more enjoyable and entertaining from the second half onward and nearer towards the end, or at least less annoying. There's some conflict on screen and the lovey-dovey cringe gets toned down. Christian Bale's character enters the picture and he was always the much better actor than Colin Farrel.The later and better part of the film unfortunately also reminds the viewer of what could have been. A fun adventure saga, a glorious historic epic, a 'Last of the Mohicans' for a new generation. If only the highly interesting subject matter had gotten the conventional execution it deserved instead of Terrence Malick's ""Art"". As it stands now, Disney's Pocahontas, mediocre as it may be, is actually the better film.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Still Needs A Trim,"Terrence Malick never ceases to impress. In stride with his classic films, BADLANDS and DAYS OF HEAVEN, the director's ode to the Captain John Smith-Pocohantas saga is a staggering work of beauty. The performances by Farrel & Co are solid. And the work of newcomer (There's No Way I Can Spell Her Name) leads the way into a stunningly accurate portrayal of love, virtue, and the human spirit. Unfortunately, Malick's cinematic indulgences tend to grow tiresome towards the end of the film; and, it soon becomes obvious that Malick needed a 5th editor (I guess 4 won't cut it for this guy).

Beautiful film who's score suffers due to a few innaccuracies,"I'll start by saying that I am not really a fan of Terrence Malick's body of work. I often find his films to be pretentious or just simply dull. I've watched this film prior and, for all I can think of, I was not in the right headspace for it at the time - I had initially rated it a 2/10. Then, for some reason, I had a strange motivation to watch it again (I think due to not realizing Bale was in it).I do think you really need to change gears when you sit down to watch this. You need to allow yourself to be taken on a ride. I think a lot of people were, or will, be turned off by the lack of dialog driving the plot: instead in this the dialog are windows into the thoughts of the characters and the plot is driven by the action in front of the camera - only assisted, at times, by dialog. For me, my interest in what life would have been like in Jamestown is what allowed me to settle in and just take it in.The acting is superb. Colin Farrell as John Smith is great and in this story he really conveys the inner conflict within him without any required help from overtly declaring so via dialog. Q'orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas as well is great and she brings the mystique one would have witnessed at time. And, of course, Bale as John Rolfe is excellent - and again, he is able to convey the characters nature very well. There is also lots of other great actors contributing throughout: Christopher Plummer, David Thewlis, Wes Studi, Ben Mendelsohn (another favorite of mine) - along with everyone else. I'm so glad I gave this another shot. Who could ask for a better cast?This story is both beautiful and tragic... And, unfortunately here, flawed. Sadly, from spending a few hours researching the reality of Jamestown, it's founding and growth, and the colonists relationship with the Powhatan, several critical facts were withheld from this story - thus, instead of a 9/10 I'm giving it an 8/10. When it comes to John Smith it appears that there was never any romantic relationship between himself and Pocahontas - at most he did know her and later, after his initial writings, he changed his story while writing Queen Anne to write that she had saved his life. But again, zero romance. It is actually believed that she was possibly married to a native man named Kocoum whom was slain during conflict with colonists - but again, this is not only a possibility as historians rely on sources of which there likely isn't much (it's not like the Jamestown colonists would go about trying to identify native casualties of conflict). Pocahontas was also not a ""princess"" - she was presented to the crown as one by the London Company. The film also elicits that the cause of violent conflict was the Powhatan, when in reality, it was the colonists: having been ordered to dominate the Powhatan (the aim of the London Company was, at minimum, to turn the Powhatan into a tributary and at maximum to integrate them into Jamestown) the colonist militia would go on raids where they would demand provisions, etc., from the Powhatan, and when refused they would burn their settlements. There was also aims to convert the Powhatan to Christianity. It was these provocations that lead to war between colonists and the Powhatan.The tragedy of John Rolfe and his relationship with Pocahontas is something that should have been included, I think, in the film (maybe it's in the extended cut - I'll have to watch that later). When they decided to leave England and return to Virginia, as stated int he film, Pocahontas fell ill - so they diverted to Kent - where Pocahontas did die. What's more, their son, Thomas, was also ill: due to his responsibility within the London Company John Rolfe continued to Virginia and left Thomas in England (first with an appointed guardian and later with his brother): the final tragedy in this story is John Rolfe never saw their son Thomas again.Anyways, while it could have been improved and the fictitious elements could have been better left out of it, this is a beautiful film. I highly recommend it to anyone with the one caveat that you have to be in the mood for it - you have to slow down.",8.0,Anonymous,History
I was not that impressed!,"I guess this film did not impress me very much because I saw so many film connected wit Pochohontas and events surrounding her.Yes scenery is great and acting is not bad, but how many of this did we see? Cartoon and everything.When I actually went to the Jamestown and saw all that is connected with her, tour guide explained us in not very happy voice, that events portrayed in the cartoon and in this film is not entirely accurate.So if you are into historic films of discovery of America, this is a film for you.Otherwise, you can live without loosing sleep even if you do not see it.",5.0,Anonymous,History
heart breaking,"I was worried that The New World would be a Disnified tale. It was not. It was something quite unlike anything I had seen before. It tells its story mostly visually, with some natural sounds and with a soaring soundtrack in the classical style.It does not explain. It leaves everything you see just as mysterious as it was for the colonists.Though there are terrible battles, it is not one of those stupid shoot-em-ups where you are supposed to presume all virtue lies with one side and all wickedness the other.The ghastliness of living in a fledgling colony is nightmarish. Not only do you deal with contaminated food, starvation, freezing, lack of water, you deal with religious and superstitious lunatics, racists, despotic power crazed loons, torture and people with gold fever who can't think of anything else.Q'orianka Kilcher who plays Pocahontas looks much like Olivia Hussey who played Juliet in Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet. She has captivating body language, but does not look like a ""natural"", what the English colonists call the aboriginal people.There is not that much humour. The one scene that made me laugh was a native exploring an English formal garden and being utterly baffled by the symmetrical shapes of the topiary.There is a lot of heartache in this movie, balanced by the joy of an untrammelled natural world. It was a bit too intense for me.",9.0,Anonymous,History
emotional poetic feast,"Wow! This is a really beautiful film. Half way through it I contemplated turning it off in fear of it falling into clichÃ© of mindless violence, and this way holding on to the grace it portrayed. But to my surprise it carries it's beauty right to the end. This is a masterpiece of love and adventure; in it's content no piece of it is out of place or lacking necessity. I am just so grateful to have seen this!",10.0,Anonymous,History
did the job for me,"i know it's cool to hate a film that colin farrell stars in, but i had to like the new world. for one, it's malick, and you can hate all you want, but he makes his owns movies and, if you don't like them, then you're just not patient enough. the bottom line is that movies need to do a couple of things for an audience. they need to entertain--i thought the storyline was fine here. they need to take you to another place--it did. never did it talk down to me, never did it look pitiful, never did it insult my intelligence. history buffs, puh-leeze, it's a movie with some peruvian fifteen-year-old playing pocahontas. deal with it. i hope my four-year old son will appreciate the storytelling of malick, who, despite people on the message boards, peaked with days of heaven, but still has some tricks up his sleeve. this movie did poorly at the box office, but i think it deserves a chance.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Not quite the Masterpiece,"My wife and I got ready for this smart, artistic and romantic film that if you kept an open mind and allowed your senses to take in the movie, it would be a memorable experience. From the start of the movie I was blown away by the stunning visuals. Nature, in it's purest form. Where the movie began to lose me was the lack of an epic feel. America seemed to be confined to a river, the fenced in village of Jamestown and an Indian camp that could have been just a mile away. The visual expertise that started wore off quickly... the landscape never changed besides a brief stint of winter.The most important aspect to a movie set in this genre and that appeals to the senses is the musical score. The mood setting music in The New World... is terrible. It truly is. I cringed constantly because the sounds of nature are overwritten with an orchestra that sounds like it's playing for a 1980's B movie. I am neither kidding or exaggerating. And this lost most of my appreciation for what the movie was attempting to accomplish. And, aside from a believable performance by Christian Bale and actress Q'Orianka Kilcher, the rest of the acting was not very good. Colin Farrell had only one look. A confused expression of sadness and loss.If you want to see an entertaining movie about Pocahontas and John Smith, see Disneys animated version. If you want to see stunning, beautiful footage of nature, watch the first 5 minutes of New World, rewind, and repeat. The rest of the movie is not worth sitting through to get to Christian Bale and his above average performance.",3.0,Anonymous,History
"""Did you find your Indies, John? You shall"". ""I may have sailed past them"".","Once again, Malick experiments with storytelling methods and this film is no exception; in order to convey to the viewer the experience of the pioneer John Smith, who is trying to find a common language with the Indian tribes and Princess Pocahontas, it was very important to demonstrate the process of non-verbal communication between the characters.Cinematographer Emanuel Lubezki, composer James Horner and the cast of Q'orianka Kilcher, Colin Farrell and Christian Bale create harmony on screen. Insanely beautiful landscapes of the virgin lands of America, a pleasant, sometimes barely noticeable soundtrack and, of course, convincing and lively acting.Every scene of this film is measured and silence is paramount here, even the heroes here prefer to communicate in a whisper, and, if possible, even switch to body language.As a result, the work turned out to be very touching and exciting. An emotional ending, a sentimental story of the relationship between two people who are not destined to be together and a gorgeous musical accompaniment - all this creates its own special confessional atmosphere.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Stuuuuuuuuuuuuuupid!,"Worst Movie I've ever seen. If I wanted to see a nature film I would stay home and watch PBS!Honestly, what were they thinking. I laughed all the way through because it was so inaccurate and portrayed the Indians as ballerinas and dancing monkeys. If you've seen the commercial you've seen it all- there really is nothing else to the movie.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!!!!! No dialog, no story, no point at all except to watch geese and water run over rocks. Everyone in the theater left astounded at the lack of substance. That is all those that stayed. Over half the theater left because it was so boring and had no point at all.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Loved It!,"i was kinda expecting a snooze fest from what i heard on IMDb even thought i was waiting to see it for a while now , I LOVED IT, Terence Mailk did a great Job i think , the cinematography was amazing , Collin was as usual not that good , although he looked great , same can be said for Christian pale only he acted better than Colline still not his best work, the story and the way Terrence shot it you can feel that there is something special and different in the way he works with the camera and uses the music in the amazing scenery shots , amazing , worth watching but not for everybody ""if you like comedies skip this one , this is for true drama lovers , not a lot of dialog though , hard to explain Terrence Malik movies Rating : 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Waste of time!!,Do not go see this movie!! It is a waste of time and money. It is agonizing slow with no plots and will put you to sleep the first 15 minutes. I sat there for 2 1/2 hours expecting SOMETHING will happen but nothing!! even the fighting seen is boring. The movie jump from one random scene to the next and leave you wonder: what is going on!! Most of the people sitting near me in the theater fell asleep and some of them left after 30-40 minutes. Collin Farrell is the only good thing in this movie although it seemed like he only spoke 4-5 times. Stick to Disney's Pocahontus animated version!!Do not waste your time on this movie!,1.0,Anonymous,History
