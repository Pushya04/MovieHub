"When You're DEAD, It's ALL OVER; but When You're LOVED, It's FOREVER !","The imaginative but well-conceived idea of dishing up a romance upon lovers communicating spiritually owing to one of them is dead, was first filmed by Steven Spielberg 8 months before the Ghost's silver screen release. Spielberg's movie Always(1989) had classy use of visuals fulfilling the needs of viewers with mystery-based expectations. Yet, Always lacked the sense of essential romance concept, despite having the same plot and even the same storyline in Ghost. Originally the idea has been created by Chandler Sprague and David Boehm.However, Ghost accomplished of what ""Always"" tried and failed to accomplish. Thanks to the great acting trio of Patrick Swayze + Demi Moore + Whoopi Goldberg, for together they registered indelible moments into Ghost. It is scraped in our memory how in time Molly and Sam happen to keep their thoughts off each others' feelings, and that taught us: ""Love begins with emotions, ends with thoughts"". On this account they never called off their faith on believing that they will keep an enduring love affair. These indelible scenes in Ghost are conceptually cut where the editing was so impressive that instead of trying to make the story more plausible, it empowered the devotion of lovers onto their relation. The scene which Sam's ghost drew upon Oda Mae's body to break the longing with Molly by kissing her is an imperishable cinematic instant.I was in love with someone, and it was February,2005; we were both watching the Ghost on TV, both talking on the phone. Then that scene came upon(Sam's ghost kissing Molly in Oda Mae's body), I felt lost deep in my heart seeking the girl I'm talking on the phone. I heard she was crying and sobbing, and keep saying to me: ""I will never forget the first time you kissed me and I don't need to be alive to recall this"" Ghost is one timeless romantic masterpiece that had its moments. For me the kissing scene was the best kiss in movies of all time. MTV had honoured this kiss as well, several years after the release of the movie, as the best kiss in '90s. Superimposing that, the scenes where Oda Mae Brown convinces Molly that Sam's ghost is around her and then Molly reasons with police that Oda Mae knows what nobody is able to know but Sam and herself only, are the scenes that deliver the magic beyond eyes and beyond ears.To watch Ghost is in the to do list of what to do when you're on a date.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Godspeed Your Love To Me""","If nothing else the popularity of the film Ghost guaranteed a revival of that great love song Unchained Melody. It's always a pleasure when good music is heard on the airways and we have Ghost to thank for this little treasure making a comeback.Ghost also provided Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore with a couple of career roles as a typical yuppie couple settling in Tribeca when tragedy strikes one of them. But as it turns out, that's only the beginning of the story.If you were to describe Ghost I guess the best way you could describe it would be a drama/fantasy with some humorous moments, mostly as a result of the casting of Whoopi Goldberg as a fake psychic. But she comes into the story in the middle of the film. Patrick and Demi, those brat pack alumni are now eager young urban professionals, Demi makes and sells her own pottery and Patrick works in a bank, in the high end area of one, he's not just a teller. When we meet them they are starting to fix up their Tribeca loft with one of Swayze's co-workers, Tony Goldwyn.But one fateful night after seeing a performance of MacBeth, Swayze is killed as a result of a street mugging. But was it just that, a simple robbery? Not by a longshot and Swayze who was killed before his time is angry enough to stay on Earth and find out what really happened.Of course he needs an ally and that's where Whoopi comes in. Turns out that there might be a little truth in her advertising as a spiritualist and consultant to the dead. Good enough for Whoopi to win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, the other Oscar Ghost won was for original screenplay.But you won't forget Patrick and Demi as a pair of literal starcrossed lovers. You also know that the universal fates will reunite them because people who care for each other as much as they did aren't destined to stay apart.I do so love Unchained Melody. Introduced originally by blues singer Al Hibbler in the Fifties it got a revival a decade later by the Righteous Brothers. Tony Bennett also recorded a fine version and after his death a previously unreleased version of it was put out by Bing Crosby's estate. It's a perfect song for the theme for Swayze and Moore.One of the best love stories of the last decade of the last century, despite the tragedy that takes place, Ghost is one feel good motion picture.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Agreeable and fascinating love story,"The motion picture concerns upon the starring's killing (Patrick Swayze) who returns from beyond to save his lover (Demi Moore) harassed by a devious killer . He's helped by a likable psychic (Woopy Goldberg) .In the film there are a wonderful love story , humor , tearjerker , suspense , action and a little bit of horror.Runtime film is appropriate , isn't slow-moving but adjusted and the movie is very entertaining.Woopy Goldberg's interpretation is fantastic and humorous , she was Oscar winner to the category for supporting cast , a very well deserved prize .The lover couple , Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze , are riveting but overblown sweets.Maurice Jarre musical score is fascinating but principal song is copied from Alex North's theme.Direction by Jerry Zucker is first class , better than his previous films like ¨Airplane¨ , ¨Top secret¨ or ¨Ruthless people¨.The movie will appeal to fantasy buffs and love stories fans.Rating: 6,5/10 . Good and well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ghost...........Classic!,"After so many years, every time when I see this movie again, it always makes my eyes water! This is basically a simple story. However, the script writer by Bruce Joel Rubin and the director by Jerry Zucker are intelligent. They made the simple story a touching, interesting one. I think most people cried at the end of the movie. This reminded me another commercial successful movie ""Titanic"" in the year 1997. The music (composed by Maurice Jarre) was so moving. Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore played well, not to mention Whoopi Goldberg. Her performance was amazing!(she also had excellent acting in Spielberg's early masterpiece ""The Color Purple"") The visual effects by ILM was extraordinary in that time. By and large, this touching movie is not only a huge commercial success, but also a classic!",,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautiful, touching and moving... a tale of a love so strong it defies death itself","I must say this film surprised me. Coming in, I knew nothing about it but the famous clay-forming scene... I didn't know I was in for such a strong experience. This film had me from the first few moments of it. I never lost interest. The plot is so interesting and intriguing, you can't help but watch, often at the very edge of your seat. I will say that I found one twist somewhat predictable, but maybe I've just seen too many later movies before watching this. There is a lot of suspense in this film. When I found that it was directed by a Zucker(yup... Airplane and so forth), I was somewhat doubtful as to any other quality in the film than the humor of it... if you're reading this and you're thinking the same, trust me; he pulls it off. Excellently. There are few, if any, flaws in directing. The writing is solid. At times, there seemed to be a little too much humor and some scenes were maybe a tad long, but apart from that, there was not really anything with this film that was flawed. The score is great. The pacing is incredibly good. The acting is really good all-round. Goldberg provides a lot of comic relief, without being obnoxious. Moore and Swayze have magnificent chemistry, you truly believe them as a couple. The special effects are grand, yet they don't take over the movie. This is driven by the emotions, by how the plot affects these characters. I was completely into this movie all the way. The humor is very good and surprisingly tasteful for the theme. Much of it is derived from the situation of Swayze's character and his interaction with environment and other characters. All in all, just a very impressive film. I recommend this to any fan of drama, romance, comedy, thriller or fantasy, as well as anyone interested in seeing a non-parody Zucker film and fans of the actors. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I have grown to love Ghost,"Ghost is the latest of a dozen or so films that I have come to appreciate much more over time. I had seen it a few times in the '90s and liked it, but not on the level of yesterday's viewing. Every film is a world unto itself, and generally speaking, the more interesting the world, the better the film. I like the world of Ghost. I like the treatment of the supernatural. The denial thereof and other character annoyances can be rationalized away quite satisfactorily. I would, however, prefer a more restrained Whoopi Goldberg, who is a little out of control for the sake of humor. It is something of a comedy after all.The special effects hold up very well. Maurice Jarre's score hits the mark (no surprise there). Jerry Zucker directs very competently. Bruce Joel Rubin won the Oscar for his marvelous original screenplay. Demi Moore is a must for Molly. Likewise for Patrick Swayze as Sam. His regrettable and untimely death adds to the mystique.Only a 6.9 on this site, but nothing talks like money with over a half-billion dollars worldwide. If you last saw Ghost many years ago and thought it good, not great, I suggest you rewatch it. It quite touched me, and may do you as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It shows surprising grace in its mix of romantic drama, fantasy and revenge thriller...","Murdered businessman in New York City sets out in ghostly form to bring his killers to justice--and to watch out over his live-in girlfriend, who may now be in similar danger. Whoopi Goldberg won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar as a not-so-fake medium who becomes Patrick Swayze's conduit to reaching lady-love Demi Moore. Whoopi is, indeed, a treasure, though Swayze is just serviceable here and Moore has to contend with a non-believing character who takes too long to come around. It might be easy for some to write this fantasy-love story off as a bloated, faded hit with a heart of F/X, but there's surprising grace and finesse in Jerry Zucker's direction. Bruce Joel Rubin also won an Oscar for his original screenplay, which has some nice twists and turns. In these hands, ""Ghost"" is nearly an unqualified success, neatly avoiding treacle and sap simply by combining a sly sense of humor with its romantic spirit--underscored by Maurice Jarre's music and the oldie ""Unchained Melody"" by The Righteous Brothers.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hard not to like it.,"""Ghost"" isn't very subtle, and similar themes have been done elsewhere with more depth, but I say just relax and enjoy.  The best reason is of course, Whoopi Goldberg, who is hilarious and as always, very good. As for the story and the characters' reactions  not being plausible, you really need to have a little imagination when you watch movies!  I give any movie credit for not being bad, since there are so many dreary movies out there, and Ghost is not bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
a lot of great scenes sign of a great movie,"This may not be a classic, but it comes close. It has one big attribute of most great movies, a lot of great scenes. The story is about Sam, who has a great life, and this movie is the opposite of CLICK. Unlike that stupid movie, this guy doesn't want to fast forward his life with a beautiful loving wife and great career. But it is taken away from him when he is killed. He becomes a ghost. And that might be one of only two flaws in the story. Why he can project his needs when billions of other dead souls can't. But a great movie like this endears us to the characters and plot enough so that this is a very trivial flaw. He finds he can communicate with a fake spiritualist (Whoopi, in a role few could do as well), which is the second flaw, since we have a feeling we've seen this character in this instance all too often. Hoever, again, if the movie is good enough we can overlook this. Without making spoilers, I can only add that the movie satisfies the viewer. There is romance, humor, logic, adventure, suspense, and great scenes. Among the great scenes that make the movie (I'll only mention some) are the scene where Sam follows his friend to the killer's apartment (actually just about every scene with his friend is classic), the scene where Whoopi goes to the bank, the scene where she leaves the bank, the scene where Sam is a ghost in the office with his friend, the scene where the friend hits on Sam's woman, the first scene with the little dark men, the second scene with the little dark men...I could go on and on. What is lost in all of this is one of the greatest emotional bits of capturing character ever, when Sam realizes what is going to happen to an evil man when the little dark men appear the second time, and he expresses true sorrow and compassion for a man who stole so much from him. This is one of the most poignant and heroic scenes ever in any movie I would find it very hard to believe anyone could not enjoy this movie. Truly a winner. Know what? This is a classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Your spirit will believe! One of the best of the 90's.,"When seeing ""Ghost"" 16 years ago with friends, and family I knew that this film would go down as a classic and it did it's one of the 90's best films. The movie in my opinion is so successful because of the many themes it's associated with it's not only a love story, but also this film has plenty of comedic moments while at the same time the main characters face a web of betrayal. The plot is well written with many turns as Patrick Swayze gives a strong performance as a New York City banker, who is gunned down and killed right in front of his sweetheart(Demi Moore)and all of this is over a dirty investment scandal. ""Ghost"" then gets very interesting when the Swayze character finds out that the after life does indeed occur! He can see people, but they can't see him! Never fear the only hope is to team with a psychic(Whoopi Goldberg who rightfully wins an Academy-Award for best supporting actress) to uncover the truth behind his murder and to rescue his love(Demi Moore). Overall this movie is a great romance that touches your heart, and makes you appreciate your loved ones especially after their gone. The laughs are also good with Whoopi and it's nice to see the now late Vincent Schiavelli have a small part as a subway ghost, who helps Patrick believe in his supernatural powers. Overall again one of the best movies of the 90's that taught us love, hope, and made us a believer that our past loved ones could be ghost. Also this picture helped make Demi Moore a superstar in the 90's, as she would earn 12 to 15 million a picture during this decade.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
We Liked This?,"This huge hit that came out of nowhere in 1990 looks pretty silly in retrospect.Because ""Dirty Dancing"" was such a big hit, people made the mistake of thinking that Patrick Swayze could actually act and began casting him in roles that required it. His eager attempts at emoting coupled with his ridiculous coif haircut are good for a chuckle or two. Speaking of haircuts, who thought it was a good idea to make Demi Moore look like a little boy? The love scene between Swayze and Moore is both embarrassing and icky, embarrassing because they rub clay all over each other and icky because Moore looks like Pinocchio.The only person who salvages the movie is Whoopi Goldberg, playing a fake medium who ends up being a real medium after all. Goldberg's crowd-pleasing performance won her an Oscar, and if anything about the film deserved an Oscar, God knows it was her.And I never want to hear ""Unchained Melody"" again....Grade: C",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Forever a classic,"Certain movies will just always be hard to write a review for. You can give your opinion and say what you enjoyed or didn't enjoy but I find myself hesitating in certain aspects just because a classic must be left some space to be a classic. Ghost as far as I'm concerned will forever be a romantic classic. It's sheer brilliance is it's twists, it is incredibly, deeply, romantic and at the same time terrifying, and has an underlying story that is never fully explored. It's got action, mystery, horror, and at the heart is the pure, simplistic romance of it all.The story is about an investment banker played by Patrick Swayze and his girlfriend, played by Demi Moore. Sam and Molly are deeply in love, planning for the future and happier in their lives than ever before. Until Sam discovers laundered money in investment accounts. He is robbed and subsequently murdered for his password to the computer in order to empty the laundered money from the accounts. But Sam doesn't go the other side. He is kept on earth in spirit form because of his unfinished business both with Molly and to discover his murderer. He must learn the ropes of being a ghost and nobody else can hear him until he runs into a so called psychic who scams people into believing she can contact their dearly departed. However it turns out, Oda Mae Brown played in her academy award winning role by Whoopie Goldberg can actually hear Sam. Together the unlikely team must help each other uncover the horrible murder plot and save Molly.Swayze and Moore make an incredible couple..hot on screen. Their careers have perhaps slipped since then one might say but this was them at their best. Swayze was indeed at the top of his game coming out of Dirty Dancing and Roadhouse and Moore was young and a new hot commodity which made them undeniably perfect together. Their roles fit them perfectly. Whoopie Goldberg was hilarious and believable as Oda Mae and her character was such an integral part of the film. Tony Goldwyn plays a great villain as the betrayer of the film. In a short time director Jerry Zucker establishes a best friendship between Goldwyn and Swayze, a deeply loving relationship between Swayze and Moore, and a plot line that goes far beneath the movie. Obviously Goldwyn's character is being used by a much higher up criminal to launder money although we never see him. Is he being blackmailed? Paid off? Something held over his head? Maybe he's not the bad guy but rather forced to commit these acts? It's a big job because we also know Willie Lopez played by Rick Aviles is involved in this as well. And deeper than that we have the theology in the film. The light brings good people to the afterlife and the dark shadowy beings torture the evil.This film is one of a few that is endlessly watchable meaning you can sit down any time and watch it through over and over and over again which is exactly what makes it a classic. It has it's holes, it has to with a plot like that. And it has it's disturbing moments, a gratituous death scene, a make out scene which although features Swayze and Moore is actually Demi and Whoopi...you have to see it to understand it. Also if Sam Wheat must learn how to physically touch things in his ghost form...how does he sit, walk, etc before he learns that? And his first experience with walking through a door happens days after his death. I'm sure sometime between then and that point he would have had to have walked through something. Perhaps those are minor points but they are things that will come up especially if you have seen it as many times as I have.The film is a must see and if you haven't seen it, go watch it right now!! Because it's one of those staples of films that everyone must know about. Ghost is amazing!! 9/10Happy Anniversary to my beautiful Sam...we watched Ghost together last night.",,Anonymous,Romance
Movie Entertainment at it's Finest,"I went into Ghost a little apprehensive. I had heard so much about it, and it was supposedly the crowning moment of one of my favorite actresses: Whoopi Goldberg. However, my apprehensions were instantly wiped away. This movie lived up to all of it's praise! It's the story of two young lovers Sam (Patrick Swayze) and Molly (Demi Moore). They have just moved in together. After a night out on the town, Sam is brutally killed by a seemingly random mugger and Molly holds Sam's bloody corpse in her arms- all while Sam's spirit watches. He has been left to wander Earth and desperately try to protect Molly. He gets help from Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg) a psychic fraud who has more power than she realized. Together, Sam and Oda Mae begin to piece together the puzzle of Sam's death, and uncover something much more sinister than they ever imagined.The whole cast does an excellent job here. Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore play the roles of grieving lovers perfectly. Ms. Moore is especially affecting. But it's Whoopi Golberg's fantastic performance as Oda Mae Brown that truly steals the show. Her performance is hilarious and endearing throughout, and she takes the film to an entirely new level. She's really is half of what makes it so good.This, in my opinion, is a great film. It entertains, it thrills you, and it even moves you. The writing is also excellent. The only place the film suffers is the special effects. Even they are fine- accept for the demons. The demons of the film are laughable. That is one major downfall. However, it's not bad enough to ruin a film that is one to be treasured. Good fun all around! 8/10 stars!Jay Addison",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
This is one of the most touching love stories ever made.,"Ghost is one of my favorite films.  It is romantic and touching. Ghost shows the love that transcends even death. The chemistry between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze is incredible.  The way they look at one another is sexier than any of those very graphic ""love scenes"".  They make a real romantic connection just through their eyes.  Ghost not only has wonderful, likeable characters in Sam Wheat, Molly Jensen, and Oda Mae Brown, but it has an engrossing plot that moves right along.  Entwined in all this is a beautiful score.  The theme song ""Ghost"", written by Maurice Jarre specifically for the movie, is enchanting, and, of course, an oldie, ""Unchained Melody"", adds another magical touch to a magical film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Zucker for Love Sories,"In 1970 we had ""Love Story"" remember? Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw crying and loving all the way to the bank? 1990 gave us ""Ghost"" love beyond death and corporate shenanigans. I saw it last night for the first time and surprise, surprise, 15 years later I do understand why people all over the world flocked to see, to devour this soufflé, again and again. Bruce Joel Rubin won an Academy Award for the screenplay, I remember Jodie Foster handing him the statuette with a smile worthy of a British diplomat. But in fact, the screenplay should have propelled the Academy to create a separate category alongside Best Original Screenplay and Best Adapted Screenplay. Yes, Smart Ass Screenplay of the year or Most Commercial Screenplay. Jerry Zucker does a masterful job allowing Rubin's stroke of genius to unfold without major interference. Demi Moore is scrumptious and what Maurice Jarre does with her tears deserves an award of its own. Patrick Swayze suffers with a certain amount of dignity, his anger is very virile but his expressions of longing are pure Lana Turner. What makes the whole calculated enterprise worth every bit of its hype is Whoopi Goldberg. She brings the tale where it really belongs. A comedy. A ghostly comedy about enduring love.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent romance about true love that lasts eternally,"GHOST, in my opinion, is an excellent romance about true love that lasts eternally. When Sam (Patrick Swayze) got mugged, I got really scared. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. If you ask me, Maurice Jarre's score is absolutely beautiful. To me, Carl (Tony Goldwyn) was a very creepy guy. Also, Willie (Rick Aviles) was just as scary as he was. I was amazed at the way Sam could step through anything in his ghostly state. All in all, everyone involved in this film did an outstanding job. In conclusion, if you like Patrick Swayze or Demi Moore, this is definitely a movie to see. You will really be touched by it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Liked It!,"I waited a LONG time to finally see this. I was expecting a schmaltzy love story - and got it BUT got a good deal more too. Just about everyone knows the story of Sam and Molly. I also knew I would have to sit through the pottery scene - fortunately it was early on. I also knew Whoopi Goldberg was in it and won her Oscar. Let's start with her. She deserved it. She was very funny, energetic, and breathed comedic life into some pretty pedestrian material at times. She is gorgeous too! The film is definitely a love story, a story of love conquering all, and love transcending death. It is also a story of redemption, good and evil, a murder mystery of sorts, and a comedy of situation at times as well. Add in some not-so-great special effects and we get spirits being asked to rise. Dark spirits whisking people to Hell. A variety of ghosts who seem content to sit around and be funny. At the core of the film, however; is a triangle of acting chemistry. No doubt at all that Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore have it. Their love looks real. Whoopi and Demi have some chemistry as well, but I think the chemistry between Whoopi and Patrick is what really carries the film. They have great timing together. They are funny together. The best parts of the film for me are the scenes where they are together. Swayze has this innocent naivete about him that really is convincing. The writing is wonderful and the direction crisp. The final scene is a tear-jerker that even I could not fail to succumb to in the end. I recommend Ghost heartily.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Charming and touching,"Ahh, Ghost. What an authentic romance classic, a film that puts a big old grin on your face whether you want it to or not, a sloppy, smile that's just wide enough to catch the tears that fall as a result of the sadness which accompanies the sweet, two essential ingredients in any love story that hopes to affect us in either direction. Balance is key, and Ghost employs both the giddy, heart-skipping joy of romance and the looming possibility of threat and tragedy in equal measures, never getting too dark or to soppy, at least for me. Demi has never been more adorable, in one of her career highlights. Her and Patrick 'Roadhouse' Swayze play star-crossed young lovers, in the beginning stages of building their lives together, a time that should be unconditionally happy for both, and is, until one fateful event rips them apart and plunges the narrative into effect. They encounter a thief in an alley one night, and Swayze is killed. Only, his spirit remains behind, for more reasons than he at first realizes. He keeps a protective, loving eye on Moore, and is driven to the notion that his death was no accident, his lingering presence meant for the purpose of both truth, love and retribution. He is aided and assisted by a sassy psychic (Whoopi Goldberg) who acts as his conduit between both realms. There's supernatural intrigue and conspiracy afoot, but as exciting as that stuff is, it's the love story between Patrick and Demi that has kept generations rooted to the story. A romance film is nothing without two leads who share both chemistry and a great script, which this one supplies generously. They are a show stopping pair in their scenes together, and if their predicament doesn't draw forth both smiles and cries from you as a viewer, well, you're wading through the wrong genre, my friend. The two of them make this one an honest to goodness winner with their performances, supported by narrative elements that only raise the stakes of their relationship. A film which will never not be a classic, and everyone should have in their collection. Ditto.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Well, I just watched Ghost again, for the first time since then. History repeated itself, and left me sobbing into my pillow. Ghost is a wonderfully touching love story, and the chemistry between Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore makes the story believable and much sadder.

What we do for love.,"Wonderful. Very exceptional romance flick with a flare of comedy. A man (Patrick Swayze)is accidentally shot and killed during a mugging. His spirit does not go to the 'here after', but remains on earth in the form of a ghost to protect his girlfriend(Demi Moore). The eye contact  between these two speak the language of love. The atmosphere is enhanced with bits and pieces of the song ""Unchained Melody"". And when it comes time and you first hear the sounds of the Righteous Brothers singing one of their trademark hits...there is not a dry eye in the house. To this day, every time I here this beautiful classic I think of GHOST and the power of love.I am not a fan of Whoopi Goldberg, but have to say she was great as the spiritualist Oda Mae Brown. Also in the cast are Tony Goldwyn and Susan Breslau. Highly recommended as a first date movie. Bring plenty of hankies. Be prepared to fall back in love with love.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A very poorly aged ""Ghost""","What we have here is another ""modern classic"" which looked much better when it came out, but failed to stand the test of time. Or probably it depends on the age of the audience, who knows...Anyway, ""Ghost"" is a rather long and predictable story about supernatural love and vengeance from the grave. However the best part of the movie is what was probably meant as comedy relief, to build up the tension for the romantic moments.It's not a good sign when the secondary plot takes the cake, relegating the core of the story to a role of pretty-but-shallow dressing.Furthermore, the ""mysterious killer"" story was so predictable it ruined whatever interest it might have had.And the love story, sorry, but I just couldn't find a good reason to care about Sam & Molly... Who are they? Why were they in love to the point of getting involved in a threesome with a potter-wheel?""Ghost"", as a love story, falls short in terms of characters' development. As a murder story is too predictable. So it's at its best as a comedy. Not totally intentional I suppose.Whoopi Goldberg as the charlatan-medium is really funny, and she manages to give some depth to an otherwise stereotypical ""fat black woman"". And Oda Mae is the best character of the movie, by a mile, just to underline how poor the effort in character creation was.The production is fine, and the script paved the way to a plethora of ""romantic dramas"" and ""romantic comedies"" in the following decades.To this day, ""Ghost"" enjoys a vast popularity, despite its obvious shortcomings. A tribute to the smart people behind the movie, or to the gullibility of the public, always ready to reach for a Kleenex at the first hint of a troubled. yet formulaic, love story?Either way, ""Ghost"" looks good but tastes worse at every further screening.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

This is a good film,"My wife loves this film, and I found it more then a romance movie.  A intriguing story, of deception, death, the after life, and greed.  This is a great film, with character you care about, suspense, romance, and a fresh script.  This film made Patricks carrier, and after this film  he chose a few films that killed his chances of acting in higher budget films.  I believe if he picked a couple more scripts like this one he would be on the same level as Tom Cruse.  I think the politically correct 90's found him too macho for their tastes, and it drove him to do that film about India which helped kill his carrier.  In the end this film is a little about what Patrick could have been, a true international star.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
In this our afterlife,"So it was a cold and wet Sunday afternoon, prematurely dark outside. My wife and I had just got in from walking our dog just before the rain really started and there was no question we weren't venturing out again. I asked her what film she thinks we should watch and she says ""a nice one"". I flick through various selections and she stops me at ""Ghost"". She saw it years ago in original release but I've never seen it, so ""Ghost"" it was.Turned out to be a good choice. I've always been a sucker for fantasy movies dealing with visitations from the afterlife and whatnot, going back to ""Topper"", ""The Bishop's Wife"" and of course the daddy of them all ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and ""Ghost"" unquestionably taps into all of that, with good ghosts hanging around their loved ones until they find release through redemption, ascending to the light while bad ghosts don't get to stay long, getting immediately dragged down to the nether regions by irresistible black forces. This latter turns out to be very convenient for Patrick Swayze's nice-guy Sam Wheat character when two of his enemies later die on him in hot pursuit.Sam doesn't get to last too long in his physical form, being slain in front of his loving girlfriend, Demi Moore's Molly by what seems to be a random mugger. When Moore is later consoled by Sam's best friend and banking work-colleague Carl, the bigger picture quickly became clearer, leading to a reasonably exciting if slightly over-the-top conclusion as Sam races to save Molly from joining him in the hereafter as the bad guys come after her.Of course, to communicate with Molly, Sam has to find a suitable conduit so enter Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae fake medium character and an entertaining sub-plot caper where she and Sam conspire to thwart Carl's embezzlement plans in person at the bank as well as the inevitable scenes where Goldberg first becomes aware of his at first unwelcome presence and later when she's trying to convince Moore of Sam's ""existence"".Sure there are slushy bits too, like the oft-parodied (and very suggestive!) pottery scene to the backdrop of The Righteous Brothers' ""Unchained Melody"", making the film a woman's favourite ever since, but that may be as much to do with big old handsome Patrick as anything else. Undoubtedly though he and Moore are two of the beautiful people, living the life in downtown New York, but they combine well and have you rooting for them all the way through. Goldberg gets to do her goofy, sometimes histrionic comedy thing but she's kept just about in check by the direction. The special effects, for the time, are fine, particularly all the out-of-body stuff.Such was the success of the movie on original release that ""Unchained Melody"" was re- released as a single in the UK due to the popularity of this film and raced to number 1 in the charts (which it never did on original issue) but I can see why. It's a warming, life- affirming entertaining movie and good clean family entertainment, an old-fashioned Hoolywood movie in the best tradition - and what's wrong with that, as someone once said?",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hasn't aged well,"It sure has that feeling of an American 90's movie and it's a bit fun seeing Swayze, Moore and Goldberg, but the movie isn't very good.The best thing about ""Ghost"" is the pleasant and enjoyable score by Maurice Jarre.Today, it is hard to believe the success of this movie. It grossed over $505.7 million at the box office on a budget of $22 million and it was the highest-grossing film of 1990. Adjusted for inflation, as of 2015, ""Ghost"" was the 93rd-highest-grossing film of all time domestically in the US. Furthermore, the film was nominated for five Academy Awards and won the awards for Best Supporting Actress for Goldberg and Best Original Screenplay. Swayze and Moore both received Golden Globe Award nominations for their performances, while Goldberg won the BAFTA, Golden Globe, and Saturn Awards in addition to the Oscar.While the acting certainly isn't bad, it's not impressive either. What's really strange is the Academy Award for the screenplay, because it really isn't a strong one. I think it's safe to say this movie has aged quite badly.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

You can't spell forever without love,"Leave it up to Unchained Melody, Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze to make pottery making into a cinematic statement screaming beauty, love and suggestive undertones. If there has ever been a more romantic scene in either film or real life, than I certainly haven't seen it! Ghost is giant melting pot of romance, thriller, suspense, comedy and a hint of the supernatural and with the loudmouth medium Whoopi Goldberg added to the roller coaster ride, you know it also has the vibrant and colourful cast to match.A young couple move into their first apartment together; she's an artist and he's the corporate type. But once again love sees no class because these young kids are deeply in love, aww how sweet, I think I might need a tissue. However soon tragedy strikes as Patrick's character Sam Wheat is murdered but what seems at first at the hands of a low life street mugger. But this is Ghost and love is so powerful and eternal that not even the afterlife can keep these two apart as Patrick spirit returns. How unfortunately the only person who can see or hear him is medium Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), so the pair must work together in a race against time to save Demi's character Molly Jensen's life when it to comes under threat.When I say the power of love, you say; Pretty Women, Dirty Dancing, an Office and a gentleman and the Notebook, but for me the true heavyweight in the world of romance is Ghost, the very epitome of love conquering all.

I neeeeeeeeed your loooooooove,"I well remember the moment I realised that Ghost was a good film.  It was several years since 1990, and I had written it off as a pointless chick flick.  Then two female friends decided to watch it and, having nothing better to do, I cynically sat down to watch it with them.  When I started to borrow tissues, I knew I'd been wrong.  It may star two of the biggest has-beens in Hollywood today, but you can't deny the emotional power of this love story from beyond the grave, somehow keeping its punch even when competing against a comedy sub-plot about a `sassy' psychic.  And remember the ugly guy on the train, too.  A cheesy classic, but a classic nonetheless.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of those romance movies that can appeal to both sexes.,"At its core this movie is in fact a chick flick, kind of in the same way the film ""Titanic"" is a chick flick. Basically, it is a film more geared to the fairer sex, but there is enough plot points and laughs and in the case of ""Titanic"" enough of a disaster to keep a guy's interest. You would think the ""Twilight"" series could do a better job at holding a guys interest, but for whatever reasons they apparently are completely hated by males, me included...sorry. This one though had an interesting enough plot after we see Swayze and Demi making pottery, as Swayze gets killed and leaves behind the love of his life. However, he sticks around as a ghost (hence the title) to try and keep his love out of harms way and to solve his own murder. Kind of hard to do when no one can see or hear you, that is until he meets a woman who claims to be able to speak to the dead. Well she is actually a fake, that is until Swayze shows up and her powers come to life. The film has some really good elements to it, a nice scene by Vincent Schiavelli in the subway. There is a nice dose of humor too mainly consisting of the scenes between Whoopie and Swayze. The film is not without its faults though as when you think about it the part where Swayze takes control of Whoopie's body is a tad creepy when you think about what is actually going on. This would be by far though Swayze's biggest movie and I think Demi's as well. Made of a very modest 22 million and grossing over 200 is quite impressive especially when you consider this movie did not exactly fly out of the gate opening only with a modest for the day 12 million. At its core a romantic movie geared to females, but with enough stuff added to keep all entertained.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I never risked seeing it again, because I was scared to cry in the presence of my family. It is so touching when Sam dies and his ghost leaves his body. Whoopi Goldberg is at her absolute best ( same goes for Patrick Swayze ) and Demi Moore is believable but not outstanding. Gosh, this was indeed a great movie. Unforgettable. The soundtrack adds that little piece of magic and romance. Every time I listen to ""Unchained Melody"", I remember ""Ghost"". The end is the most beautiful part of the movie.

Good romantic film,"The story is classic: Sam (Patrick Swayze) is a successful accountant earning the big bucks in the big city. He's got it all: A great job, a great apartment, a great girlfriend to share it with, and an overall great life. Curled up in bed with his girl, Molly (Demi Moore), he watches a news program stating that an airplane crashed and everyone aboard the aircraft died. ""Just imagine,"" he says. ""In an instant--just like that. Bam."" He is, of course, referring to the instantaneity of death.The irony in the situation is that we all know the same thing is about to happen to him, and indeed it does, when Sam is shot dead in front of Molly by a mysterious stranger who runs off into the night. Sam dies immediately, and it takes us a few moments to realize this--since we continue to see him run after the killer. It's then that it dawns on us: it's his ghost.Unable to make contact with the living, Sam follows Molly for weeks preceding his death. (This is where that ""SNL"" skit came in--""Oh, Molly, don't do that, it's disgusting! There's a tissue right across the room!"" I've got a bit more info on that later on.) However, Sam soon realizes that his old friend and fellow accountant (Tony Goldwyn) had hired a man to shoot Sam because he had seen evidence of money laundering in one of the accounts.Now, in order to warn Molly of possible danger, Sam enlists the help of a psychic hoax (Whoopi Goldberg) to pay a visit to Molly and tell her the truth about everything. ""Go away!"" she yells as Sam taunts her with obnoxious songs until she agrees to tag along and go visit his old girlfriend.It's useless to delve any deeper into the plot, since it's all pretty predictable. But in all honesty, it's a fun ride getting to the end. This is a film that uses a tried-and-true formula of good vs. Evil to achieve its goals. It's as old as the days and as true as nothing. I'm reminded of that speech about principals by Donald Kaufman in ""Adaptation"": ""This works, and it has through all recorded time."" No doubt he had ""Ghost"" in mind when he said that. (I'm just joking.)",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good,"The setup: After being killed during a botched mugging, a man's love for his partner enables him to remain on earth as a ghost.The verdict: Strong cast pulls the most out of mediocre material. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. The kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one. If you can find it on DVD or Bluray for under $8, buy it, but it won't be worth much more than that to you because it's a bit outdated.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Corporate Movie-Making At Its Most Predictable,"GHOST hearkens back to films of the 1940s and 1950s which mixed screwball comedy, romance, and suspense with a ghost story. And GHOST reads exactly like a cross between TOPPER RETURNS and A GUY NAMED JOE: Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is murdered--but his spirit remains earthbound, seeking to uncover his own killer and re-establish contact with his beloved and grieving Molly (Demi Moore.) Eventually Sam manages to establish contact with a fraudulent medium named Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg)--and in exchange for helping her out in the spiritualist business he convinces her to act as his agent on the earthly plane.All of this sounds fine in theory, but GHOST plays like something created by corporate marketing men, and instead of a fantasy confection the film serves up something more akin to a three month old poundcake awash in slobbering sentimentality. The cast makes absolutely no attempt to create characters--but given the zero-quality script level you can hardly blame them; the story itself is extremely predictable, and if you don't know who killed Sam halfway through the film you need to run out for quick brain-scan; and everything from cinematography to editing to design is just as ho-hum as it can be.The only reason to watch this film is for Whoopi Goldberg, who is absolutely hilarious as Oda Mae Brown--but frankly even Goldberg's comic turn can't make this turkey fly, and if you want to see her at her comic best I'd recommend you catch some of her stand-up work. My recommendation? Hunt down a copy of TOPPER RETURNS and A GUY NAMED JOE and watch the originals instead.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Spectral,"Sometimes a movie just grabs you.This one is formulaic. I have not a shred of respect for the artists involved, not a one, not a shred. And yet it works for me.And it works even though I am deeply engaged in all sorts of self-referential and ""ironic"" structures. This story takes itself serious. There is humor of a sort: Whoopie Goldberg is convinced she needs to be funny, so does her jackanapes thing, but that's IN the story, not of it.It may take a special sort of talent for people to seem like they really are taking things at face value. Demi does this particularly well  something her former husband just couldn't do.What happens for some is that the foundation story is so strong, the yearning so overwhelming that we join in. All the business about money laundering and threats is basically background noise to make things move while we can steep in this notion of love and loss, sustained desire.I admit I cried. It may be because I watch tons of clever movies and simply need a place to pour out.I'm not sure about the development of popular songs in film. ""American Graffiti"" was more than 15 years before. The excuse for songs there was that kids listened to the radio. Still here, we couldn't accept a song as simply part of the score. We had to be introduced to it as a record being played in the story, during that erection scene. Afterward, it could be recalled, but only after that literal insertion into the world of the story.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Romance
How to send this movie to heaven ? (dvd),"This movie looks like the thoughts I had the day we buried my grandmother one year ago. I nearly shouted to her with my heart and soul but nothing happens in front of me. If she was there, how can explain we can't communicate. The best conclusion I had was that as she can't move things, she was really in an other plane, explaining we can't speak to each other.Thus it was great that a movie tries to answer the same existential question and meeting the same paradox: how does Sam the ghost can pass thought everything but can sit on a real chair: well, it's about experience and mind. Beyond this, the movie offers really great scenes about being a ghost and it's strange nobody does it like this since Shakespeare. It's more about sharing your lover sorrow, being her shadow than doing poltergeist.Another good thing is that it's not only paranormal and romance, it's also a thriller and a comedy. Swayze (who sadly turns into a real one now) and Demi was really a fine couple but this movie hasn't changed my opinion about Goldberg: she was irritating me before and she is after.Another weak point is the dark spirits: if they are here to punish bad people, they are rather good spirits. But talking about the devil would be a new discussion in another movie. So i conclude for those who like the ""Unchained Melody"", urging them to listen to U2's cover because it's simply surreal!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Both romantic and glamorous,"I love Ghost. It is a film that manages to be both romantic and glamorous, sometimes even at the same time. And it also manages to mix the sentimental and the supernatural wonderfully. The production values are great, the special effects are a treat and the costumes, lighting, sets and cinematography are top drawer.The soundtrack also fits accordingly. Unchained Melody is a touching song and used to great effect here. The script is of good quality, and the story has a great premise with a poignant love-beyond-the-grave theme and a ending that proves that pure schmaltz actually does work. Jerry Zucker's direction is very good.I love the performances too. Patrick Swayze gives one of his best performances as the murdered banker who tries to warn his girlfriend that she is in danger. Demi Moore isn't as good, in fact she is just okay to start with but gets better through the course of the movie. It is Whoopi Goldberg who steals the show in a performance that is outstanding, her presence doesn't jar at all and livens up what could have been a maudlin atmosphere.All in all, a great film with a great premise and worth seeing for Swayze and Goldberg. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Whoopi Goldberg Had Me Laughing So Hard!,"Ghost is an underrated blockbuster. It had a healthy box office fun, in fact was the highest grossing film of 1990. Yet no one seems to talk about these days. Every once in awhile, that pottery scene would be spoofed but that seems to be it. When I first saw the movie, I was emotionally wrecked. I believed in the romantic chemistry between Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore. Moore's character has a tendency to make idiotic choices but if you were put in her position, wouldn't there be a chance you could so the same. Grief can do fickle things, so I am more forgiving. There are great romantic scenes, but the film has all what is needed for a fun, memorable blockbuster. There is action, comedy relief (due to Whoopi Goldberg's magnificent performance), romance, and horror. All this situated around the main ghost story. Do you know what horrified me? The idea of being a ghost in the NYC subway system. It is bad enough as it for the living. Those scenes...and Vincent Schiavelli truly frightened me. There are some flaws, especially in the script, but only those looking for something mighty deep will care. I have seen people ask questions about heaven and why Swayze's character is still looking back in his human life instead of moving forward. I suppose that's love. You want to make sure your loved ones are okay before moving on. Maybe it is the use of Maurice Jarre's perfect placement of ""Unchained Melody,"" but the ending wrecks me each time I see the movie. I also tend to place myself in the story. What if it was I who tragically died leaving my loved ones behind? So, there is a relatable element to the story.If you had to make a guess who directed the movie, I can guarantee that Jerry Zucker would not be one of those guesses. The man behind spoofs like Airplane! Would make a semi-serious movie like Ghost? Yep, and he did very well! He was not just looking to branch out or find his own identity, he just wanted to make a good movie. Does it count that this movie was nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars? So, I would say his mission was a success. I did like how the script explored the world of the supernatural. Is this how Bruce Joel Rubin believed life after death would be like? We could be in the world between life and heaven if there is something that needed to be fulfilled? I liked how the script insinuated many things about the post-death world, but it isn't as deep as it could have been. Again, not an issue for me. The special effects hold up very well. The images of Schiavelli's ghastly ghost are forever embedded in my brain.The film is about a man named Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze). He is a bank executive and recently moved in with his girlfriend, Molly (Demi Moore). While they were out on a date, Wheat is mugged. He is about to hand over his wallet when he is shot to death. As a ghost, he learns that his death was not accidental as he was about to learn about a money laundering scam. Instead of going directly to heaven, he stays behind to keep an eye on Molly, unbeknownst to her. He was able to stop the perp who killed him from going after Molly, but he has no one to tell what happened. He meets a clearly-fake psychic Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg). She is clearly shocked to be hearing from an actual ghost, but she may be Sam's only hope to let Molly know what exactly is happening. She has a hard time believing Oda and may instead lean towards her and Sam's good friend, Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn) who may not seem like the person he pretends to be.This movie came out when Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore were on top of the world. Swayze was riding high on Dirty Dancing and Road House. Moore was projected to become the next big thing in Hollywood. One could say their careers diminished after this movie, but you wouldn't know watching them together. They had such superb romantic chemistry, which makes the ending even more exceptionally tearjerking. The pottery scene is fantastic. It shows their chemistry and how good the special effects were. Goldberg was originally not going to be in the film, but she got the part thanks to Swayze's insistence and belief in her abilities. She was rewarded with an Oscar and her most memorable performance. She plays her character over-the-top, but that is the entire point. It is who her character is. I got some fantastic belly laughs whether she is making out with Demi Moore (although her body is inhibited by Swayze) or bantering with her sisters. She was hilarious! I do need to mention Vincent Schiavelli. His phantom is terrifying!Overall, Ghost is a movie that can make you laugh, make you cry, and deliver awe with its special effects. It seems to fly under the radar despite making half a billion dollars at the global box office and earning awards recognition. It is one of those great blockbusters that have something for everyone. There are some flawed moments, but they do not ruin the story by any means. I have now seen the film several times and I teared up each time. If you want a gleeful combination of chills up your arms, an aching (in heartbreak and joyfulness) heart, and belly laughs, I recommend Ghost.My Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
FunnyBerg,"Ghost Is a chick flick but does offer dudes a little more than most from this genre.This I think, is largely due to Goldberg who steals the show for anyone not undressing Swayze with their eyes.

A fair movie but nothing special.,"Ghost made serious money in theatres. It was the highest grossing film of 1990. It had incredibly broad appeal with it's slick combination of action, romance and comedy. Does that make it a great film? No, but Ghost is still worth a watch. The originality of the film's premise made my first viewing of Ghost quite enjoyable. I mean in how many movies is the main character a Ghost for most of the film? This is the only such movie I have even heard of. However, it is when you look beyond the novelty of the Ghost premise, that you see the film for what it really is; a very routine, predictable piece of Hollwood film making. This is not a bad film. It's just not interesting enough to be worth more than one or two viewings,especially for fairly experienced movie buffs like me. That said, I still recommend that you see Ghost some time or another. The fun performances of Whoopi Goldberg and especially Patrick Swayze and the entertaining ghost effects make the movie worth viewing, but just don't expect a timeless classic.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Love Demi,"The imaginative idea of writing a romance upon lovers communicating spiritually for one of them is dead, was first filmed by Steven Spielberg 8 months before the Ghost's silver screen release. His movie Always(1989) had its visuals fulfilling the needs of viewers with action-based expectations. Yet, Always was lack of the sense of romance, despite having the same plot and even the same storyline of the Ghost. Originally the idea has been created by Chandler Sprague and David Boehm.However, Ghost accomplished of what ""Always"" tried and failed. There were indelible moments in Ghost, which were lessons to whom wants to be loved. It is scraped in our memory how Molly and Sam kept their thoughts off each others' feelings, that taught us: ""Love begins with emotions, ends with thoughts"". On this account, they never called off their faith on believing to last endlessly together. There were also indelible scenes in Ghost, where the editing was so impressive that instead of trying to make the story more plausible, it empowered the devotion of lovers onto their relation. The scene which Sam's ghost drew upon Oda Mae's body to break the longing with Molly by kissing her is eternal.I was in love with someone, and it was February,2005; we were both watching the Ghost on TV, both talking on the phone. Then that scene came upon(Sam's ghost kissing Molly in Oda Mae's body), I felt lost deep in my heart seeking the girl I'm talking on the phone. I heard she was crying and sobbing, and keep saying to me: ""I will never forget the first time you kissed me, the next would be the end of my life"" Ghost is one timeless romantic masterpiece that had its moments. For me the kissing scene was the best kiss of all time. MTV had honored this kiss as well, several years after the release of the movie, as the best kiss in a movie of the last decade of the 20th century. Superimposing that, the scenes that Oda Mae Brown convinces Molly that Sam is around her and then Molly reasons with police that Oda Mae knows nobody is able to know but Sam and herself only; are the scenes that deliver the magic beyond eyes and beyond ears.To watch Ghost is in the to do list of what to do when you're on a date.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A film stands as a testament to the power of love that transcends the boundaries of life and death,"Ghost, directed by Jerry Zucker, is a timeless romantic fantasy that seamlessly blends elements of drama, suspense, and the supernatural. Released in 1990, this film not only captivates audiences with its compelling storyline but also leaves an indelible mark due to its unforgettable performances and iconic moments.At the heart of the narrative is the poignant love story between Sam Wheat, portrayed by Patrick Swayze, and Molly Jensen, played by Demi Moore. Their on-screen chemistry is palpable, drawing viewers into the depth of their relationship. The film takes an unexpected turn when Sam is tragically murdered, and his spirit remains on Earth to uncover the truth behind his death and protect Molly from impending danger.One of the film's standout elements is its exploration of the afterlife and the theme of unresolved emotions. Sam's journey as a ghost navigating the mortal realm creates a unique and emotional perspective on love and loss. The iconic pottery scene, set to the haunting melody of ""Unchained Melody"" by The Righteous Brothers, has become synonymous with romance in cinema, showcasing the film's ability to balance sensuality with emotional depth.The character Oda Mae Brown, portrayed by Whoopi Goldberg, injects a perfect blend of humor and heart into the narrative. Her Oscar-winning performance as a reluctant medium adds a layer of complexity to the film, providing both comic relief and a conduit for Sam's messages from the afterlife.Jerry Zucker's direction ensures a seamless blend of genres, creating a film that resonates with a broad audience. The suspenseful moments, coupled with the tender exploration of love enduring beyond the physical realm, contribute to the film's enduring appeal. The cinematography, notably capturing the ghostly realm and the bustling streets of New York, enhances the visual experience, immersing the audience in the film's world.Furthermore, the soundtrack, featuring not only ""Unchained Melody"" but also Maurice Jarre's emotive score, elevates the emotional impact of key scenes. It complements the narrative, underscoring the passion and poignancy of the characters' journeys.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ghost is a highly romanticized love story that happens to feature elements of crime and suspense. A worthy rental for those interested in the afterlife.,"Ghost is a highly romanticized love story that happens to feature elements of crime and suspense. It's a movie that begs the question ""What happens after you die"" and offers a spin not often thought about in regards to the afterlife. The film, starring Demi Moore, Patrick Swayze, and Whoopi Goldberg has been praised by some and criticized by others. It got nominated for Best Picture when it was released in 1990 and received a variety of other nominations. I tend to walk with those who praise the film, regarding it as a authentic love story that, although super cheesy, really does provide a sense of wonder as to what one may be able to do after they die.Ghost starts out like a very traditional love story. We're introduced to Sam and Molly (Swayze and Moore), a young and in love couple that just moved in together in an old New York loft. After a few romantic interactions, one being one of the most arguable romantic ever caught on film (the pottery scene set to the tune of Unchained Melody), we realize that this couple couldn't exist without one another. Their love is such that it could quite possibly only exist in movies. Regardless, we believe in it, we appreciate it, and we remember it throughout the rest of the film.What happens next shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone familiar with the story. Sam is killed in the streets while walking home with Molly. He sees the light, but decides he isn't quite ready to go just yet. Instead, he stays on Earth, to be with Molly, only to come to the realization that no one can hear him, see him, feel him, or talk to him. He's simply a fly on the wall, someone who's able to look over the ones he loves, but provide no assistance in how things play out. That is, until he meets Oda Mae Brown, a local psychic, who's able to hear his voice and play a crucial role in saving Molly from the men who Sam believes murdered him for money.Ghost is more successful at being a love story than a crime drama, but it does make sense as a background to the story. Sam is not only able to track his killers (without them knowing), but he's also able to warn his wife of the incoming danger and give her the clues necessary to solve the crime. The most interesting part of the film is seeing Sam and Molly interact through Oda Mae Brown. At first, Molly doesn't want to accept the fact that her dead boyfriend is literally standing right next to her. It takes a number of personal insights (the color of her underwear, the location of their first date, and a reference to ""ditto"") to make her a believer, but once she accepts that Sam is present in the afterlife, the story starts to transform into a romantic thriller that hits all the right notes in both of its respective genres.If there's one thing that doesn't really work in Ghost, it's the final twenty to thirty minutes when Sam learns how to move things, punch people, type on keyboards, etc. To me, it feels a little fake, and loses out on the premise that made the film so promising in the beginning. He can essentially do things that a ghost shouldn't be able to do, and to me, it takes things a little too far in terms of believability. Some people would argue that the whole film is too far of a stretch, no one can hear dead people. I for one, accept that piece of the puzzle, but as far as an actual physical presence that can interact with psychical surroundings, I don't feel like going that far.Regardless, Ghost offers a romantic love story that will make your heart melt. Whether or not you appreciate the crime backdrop will depend vastly on the person, but the love story should be quite universal. See this movie, realize the hype, download Unchain Melody, and think about those you love. Could you live without them? Would you stick around to see them through? Ghost asks a lot of questions, but provides clarity on one: Does true love exist? Yes. Just let Sam show you.Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A first-rate crowd pleaser,"Once in a blue moon, a movie ascends to become a touchstone, a pop culture reference, a classic to a generation. This is that. An old fashioned yarn, assembled with so much stand-and-cheer enthusiasm, you can't help but be swept away in this tale of betrayal and true love. It all begins with banker Sam Wheat and his partner Carl Bruner. When Wheat discovers some financial misdeeds he is gunned down in front of the love of his life, Molly Jensen. Now wandering as a powerless spirit, he is forced to watch Carl move in on his true love. With the help of psychic medium Oda Mae Brown, in a career defining performance from Whoopi Goldberg, will he be able to get a message to his love, and set everything right? Scenes from this movie are cultural touchstones, and it's charming (but revolutionary at the time) dated special effects do nothing to hamper this evergreen.

It was definitely fun to revisit this movie for the first time in decades and it will always be one of the definitive 90s romances.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Still a wonderful movie,"Just finished watching this - it's been at least 20 years since I last saw it. Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg were so amazing with each other. The chemistry between them was just excellent. The scene towards the end when Sam steps onto Oda Mae's body was beautifully done. To have handled it any other would have ruined the scene because the audience would have been focused on two women together, which at the time would have been controversial. I still think it's a beautiful scene and handled just right. This movie has aged very well. It's also interesting to see the three leads at this point in their careers and to see New York neighborhoods at the time. AAlso, I still don't like Tony Goldwyn because of this role ...

A Great Film,"This is one film that works on so many different levels.  First and foremost it is a great love story that shows how even though someone dies, love for a person never dies.  It manages to do this without becoming sappy.  It also is a great thriller as you see Sam as he tries to save Molly from Willie and Carl while he is in his ghostly state.  Many of those scenes scenes kept me on the edge of my seat.  But most of all the comic moments with Whoopi Goldberg were what helped make this film an all around entertainment.  She provided some much needed humor into what is pretty much a serious film and won a well deserved Academy Award for her performance.  This film is definitely an all time classic.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Decent, the 6.6 is about right","I wish my own experience with a ghost had turned out as clear and happy as the one in this movie. Patrick Swayze is not a great actor, and neither is Demi Moore, but they can pull it off when they need to, and here they do as fine a job as they do in any other of their films. Whoopi Goldberg has always chose these kind of roles--independent women with lots of talent (remember Eddie?). The film has no cohesive photographic style, though, and the art direction is similarly disjointed. Still, if you need a feel good ghost story, you can go in for this one. I am still dealing with my most unpleasant ghostly experience (I lived in a haunted house, and I recognise how unbelievable that sounds).",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Eternal Love and Spectral Thrills: The Timeless Magic of Ghost,"Ghost, directed by Jerry Zucker and released in 1990, stands as a timeless classic that masterfully blends romance, suspense, and supernatural elements into a compelling narrative that continues to captivate audiences decades after its release. This film is not just a story of love transcending death, but a rich, emotionally engaging journey that touches on themes of loss, justice, and the enduring power of the human spirit.At its heart, Ghost is the love story of Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) and Molly Jensen (Demi Moore). Swayze and Moore's on-screen chemistry is palpable, making their relationship feel authentic and deeply moving. Their portrayal of a couple whose love is so profound that it defies even the boundaries of death is both heart-breaking and uplifting. Swayze's performance, in particular, is a standout. He brings a nuanced mix of charm, vulnerability, and determination to Sam, making the character's journey from life to afterlife and his quest to protect Molly both believable and compelling.Whoopi Goldberg's portrayal of Oda Mae Brown, a fake psychic who discovers she can actually communicate with the dead, is nothing short of brilliant. Goldberg infuses the character with a perfect blend of humour, sass, and unexpected depth. Her performance earned her a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Oda Mae's transformation from a con artist to a crucial ally for Sam is one of the film's most delightful arcs, providing much-needed comic relief while also delivering some of the movie's most heartfelt moments.The film's screenplay, written by Bruce Joel Rubin, is a masterclass in balancing multiple genres. Rubin's script seamlessly integrates romance, thriller, and supernatural elements, creating a narrative that is as thrilling as it is touching. The dialogue is sharp and memorable, and the pacing keeps the audience engaged from start to finish. The iconic scene where Sam, as a ghost, helps Molly shape a clay pot while the Righteous Brothers' Unchained Melody plays in the background, remains one of the most romantic and iconic moments in cinematic history.Ghost also excels in its technical aspects. The special effects, especially for its time, are impressive and effectively convey the ethereal presence of spirits. The depiction of Sam's ghostly abilities, including his interactions with physical objects and other ghosts, is handled with creativity and precision. The visual effects enhance the story without overshadowing the emotional core of the film.Maurice Jarre's musical score deserves special mention as well. The hauntingly beautiful melodies perfectly complement the film's emotional tone, enhancing both the suspenseful and romantic elements of the story. The music, combined with the film's superb sound design, helps to create an immersive atmosphere that draws the audience into the world of Sam and Molly.One of the most powerful aspects of Ghost is its exploration of themes related to life, death, and the afterlife. The film offers a comforting perspective on death, suggesting that love and justice can extend beyond our mortal existence. Sam's journey to uncover the truth behind his murder and to protect Molly serves as a poignant reminder of the enduring power of love and the importance of seeking justice.Ghost is not just a film but an emotional experience. It skilfully weaves together elements of romance, comedy, and thriller to create a story that is both entertaining and deeply moving. The performances by Swayze, Moore, and Goldberg are unforgettable, and the film's exploration of love and loss continues to resonate with audiences. Whether you are watching it for the first time or the twentieth, Ghost remains a powerful and poignant cinematic achievement that stands the test of time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best and saddest movie!!!,"I love this movie to pieces. I can't get enough of it like Dirty Dancing. Two of my oldy all time favorites! This is movie was fun with the comedy (Applause to Whoopie) and the dramatic change the movie comes to. The love scene between Sam and Molly was the best. So sweet and sensual, really declaring their love for each other. Poor Molly though, her heart is ripped from her chest when Sam dies. She had no idea it was a setup, but that's when Whoopie comes in and talks to Molly through Sam. It is really a wonderful cast and such great characters. I thought at the end of the movie that heaven was going to allow Sam to come back to life, but I guess not. With them thinking Sam had no idea that he was going to die. But the ending was really a tear jerker and when he got shot at the beginning. I give this movie a FULL 10! I'm also a huge fan of Tony Goldwyn. Amazing actor!

When he starts to find out things, he has to tell Demi Moore's character and that is where Whoopi's character comes in - she is a medium and she hears Patrick. There is a sensual chemistry between the two main characters, and there loss of one another is very heart wrenching.

Incredibly inconsistent but Goldberg is wonderful and it's utterly life-affirming.,"Ghost is a strange one. Certainly something special for the novelty. It's perhaps the most inconsistent film I've ever seen. Some parts brilliant, some parts ludicrous. Poor execution or poor idea? I can't tell. According to Bruce Joel Robin, back in 1990, he was told Ghost was the best screenplay ever written in Hollywood. It was even awarded the Oscar. It doesn't receive that much acclaim nowadays, Pulp Fiction must've blown it out of the water and Hollywood begged for forgiveness from Casablanca. It now stands quite oddly, part dated (though I can forgive misguided special effects) and part beyond its time. It's like Michael Jackson's Thriller. A deliberately mixed bag with something for everyone. In Ghost, every character is perceived in tone and style through a different genre. There's romance, comedy, crime thriller, murder mystery and even a touch of horror. Unfortunately, this makes it wildly erratic.In fact, while its first few punchy moments showed promise, it's first half hour is an utter lame bore. There's a few setups that are intelligent in hindsight, but Patrick Swayze's poor acting betrays the material. Unconvincing isn't even the word. He's absolutely laughable, his reactions to things are pure parody. Its iconic moments feel ridiculous in context. The film doesn't start to get bearable until Whoopi Goldberg's appearance. She's surprisingly delightful, I always kinda doubted whether she deserves her acclaim, but she certainly does. Her addition gives the film an incredibly fascinating and entertaining dynamic. Makes it a much richer and immersive film. She always earned belly laughs with every joke. And the twists and turns keep coming at a Shakespearean rate with the amount of betrayal. Despite Swayze's acting, the emotion of the film works and its metaphysical ideas of life after death are easy to connect to and it ends wonderfully life-affirming.However, while its admirably ambitious to try and display different characters through different genres and weave between them, it does mean we get immersed in one side of the story story and have that dissatisfying feeling of being disconnected from others in the film. Then leave that character we were immersed in and that's dissatisfying. I'm not sure why it doesn't work emotionally as it's a pretty great idea from Rubin and Zucker. I can't help but wonder what this story would be like as a play. There were many times when I really wanted to break away from the camera's limited perspective and look at a different character. The stage would allow that freedom and it would be a richer experience. Though they'd have to figure out how to do the passing-through-objects convincingly. I know there's a musical but it's sentimental enough already. Regardless, this film was a huge success. Maybe we can call Ghost the most commercial script ever written instead.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

A MASTERCLASS FROM THE PATRICK SWAYZE SCHOOL OF OVER-ACTING,"""Ghost"" isn't a bad movie by any means, even 30 odd years after it was made.
I saw it first all those years ago and I liked it much more at the time.But, if you REALLY want to see how an actor should NOT act, just watch Swayze's performance for a Masterclass. In this movie, he has just two facial expressions in his repertoire. The soppy loving one and the WTF one. Most of his movie was spent with the WTF one cemented on his dial and that really does detract from what would otherwise be a better movie. The other main character in this movie, Carl, played by Tony Goldwyn, obviously drew heavily on Swayze's performance with his own very similar line in soppy and WTF expressions.The one real saving grace in Ghost is the positively delicious Demi Moore as Molly. She was worth the price of admission in 1990 and these days she justifies this month's Netflix subscription all on her own.I still kind of like Ghost despite Swayze and his clone.JMV",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the hits of 1990,"""It's amazing, Molly. The love inside, you take it with you.""Only one film beat Jerry Zucker's Ghost at the U.S. Box Office in 1990 and that was Home Alone, but Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore's romantic fantasy managed to take everyone by surprise as it topped other films like Pretty Woman, Dances With Wolves, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Total Recall, Goodfellas, and even the sequels for Die Hard, The Godfather, Robocop, and Back to the Future. What is surprising is that this ghost tale still remains such a beloved classic to this date, thanks in most part to the amazing chemistry between Swayze and Moore and to the fantastic soundtrack performed by The Righteous Brothers. I don't know however, if this film would've worked without Whoopi Goldberg's hilarious supporting performance (which won her her only Oscar) considering the story doesn't really pick off until she enters the picture. Of course that overly emotional touching scene at the end is what everyone probably remembers (and the reason why this film won an Oscar for Original Screenplay), but I don't think it has aged too well. The film is entertaining, although it is cheesy at times and the visual effects don't live up to today's standards. What surprised me the most when I saw this is how well it balances those melodramatic moments with the comedy, because I always believed this film was a romantic tale from beginning to end, but it really is more of an action comedy with several twists along the way (albeit predictable ones). There is no doubt that the universal premise of wanting to believe that our loved ones are still with us when they pass away to protect and guard us is what really sold this film and Ghost easily manages to tell that story with two likable actors sharing a strong chemistry together.The film opens by introducing us to a lovely couple, Sam (Patrick Swayze) and Molly (Demi Moore), who've just bought a property and are ready to make their dreams a reality. Carl (Tony Goldwyn) is Sam's good friend and work partner at the bank who is always there supporting him and Molly. However, their dreams are shattered when Sam is murdered after a thug tries to steal his wallet one night. Sam's spirit remains on Earth and he discovers that this wasn't simply a robbery and that Molly's life is also in danger. He must warn her before it's too late, but no one seems to see or hear him. That is until Sam meets a psychic named Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg) who will try to convince Molly that she can speak to her dead lover's spirit before it is too late.Up to this point Jerry Zucker was known mainly for co-directing satires like the classic Airplane!, Top Secret!, and Ruthless People. Prior to his solo directorial feature debut in Ghost, he had helped write the screenplay for Naked Gun as well, so he was mainly known for his work in satires. Many probably believed this ghost story was just another satire and so the romantic story took everyone by surprise. I'm sure Bruce Willis was regretting not having accepted to co-star along with his wife at the time, and that may be the reason why he accepted to star in The Sixth Sense years later. It's a different film but it does seem to borrow certain ghostly elements from this romantic tale. I did find it kind of ironic that in the 90's you had these actors standing next to each other being forced to act as if they couldn't see one another, while now you actually have actors forced to talk to characters who aren't there but thanks to the magic of movies and CGI are easily placed later.estebueno10.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Whoopie Goldberg was the best thing in this film,"Whoopie Goldberg was the best thing in this film, overrated beyond belief when it came out, and overall fairly shallow although it has its moments. Demi Moore (she of the ""beautiful hair"" - see ""Friends"" where Phoebe cuts Monica's hair) seems to be trying an Audrey Hepburn impression taken from Breakfast at Tiffany's, which only serves to remind us of who is the better actress (Hepburn can act her socks off while still being cute and elfin, Demi Moore just looks cute and elfin). As for Swayze, it's the only thing I've ever seen him in, and likely to remain so, judging by this performance. The guy may be cute, if you like that sort of thing, but I found his acting so bad that at times I laughed out loud. To be honest, I thought he could give William Shatner a run for his money. It was left to Whoopie Goldberg to show us what real acting is like, and although her character did not have much variety or development to work with, she managed to steal the show. The film had some comic moments and was not a total waste of time, but touching it was not. Only bother if it's raining and you really have nothing else to do.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

The problem with most of them is that their unwillingness to respect any established boundaries of moral theology ungrounds the entire universe and leaves a product that is unhuman.""Ghost"" does not make that mistake. Although the metaphysics are clearly fantastical, we can suspend disbelief, because it is quite clear throughout that love and good works are the path to salvation, while hatred and evil deeds are the path to damnation. While there is no overt religious iconography, there are still a few satisfying if amorphous suggestive elements that a discerning eye can easily connect to formal religious doctrine.Whoopi Goldberg's Oda Mae is often written off as just another ""Magical Negro"" trope. It is true that hers is a black supporting character whose role in the primary plot is to expedite, through (highly) extraordinary means, the resolution of the white protagonists' conflict. However, Oda Mae is a far more interesting character than either Sam or Molly, both in personality and in backstory, and is also, unlike Sam and Molly, dynamic: along the way to getting them out of their glut, she is forced to confront her rotten past as a charlatan and turn her life around. There is a partial inversion of the trope here, for it is the undeveloped, static and almost supernaturally angelic Sam who ends up leading the formerly banally criminal Oda Mae to salvation, and she repays him by helping to save Molly, the woman he loves.Although, it's not entirely clear that Sam was actually meant to be so bland, and indeed, if you're watching the movie looking for personal inspiration, he and Molly might not be the best in terms of making an emotional connection. It's clear that they love each other very deeply, and for many people that may well be enough to make an emotional connection. I would have liked a little something more, but then, I've never tried to watch this as a date movie. At the least, your girlfriend won't suspect you only wanted to watch it for the incredible special effects, which do not exist. Have fun!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Whoopi's baby,"I like this movie but only because of Whoopi Goldberg. Without her this flick is intolerable, mostly because of Patrick Swayze being a fake movie star. He was a good dancer but an off-putting actor; ditto Demi Moore re being another off-putting actor. Whoopi is the comedy relief, and almost the only levity. The special effects are actually delightful, especially for the 20th century. The look of this movie is beautiful and the soundtrack is catchy.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Entertaining but silly,"I find ""Ghost"" to be a highly entertaining bit of silliness.  The believability factor here is absolute zero, so leave your brain at the door -- but the film is funny, entertaining and moving at parts.  The (much discussed) ending IS in fact sickeningly sweet and sentimental (as well as straining credibility to the point of embarrassment), but it can't put the film into the ""new age drivel"" category since the movie never does take itself very seriously.Overall, a very entertaining and engaging film with some over the top moments, and an ending almost as ""bad"" as Fatal Attraction.  You don't have to enjoy love stories to like this film (although it will help) -- if you can suspend disbelief (or just ignore it) and don't have too many preconceived notions of ""after death,"" you will be entertained.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ghost of a chance,"Interesting drama/mystery/love story only spoiled by hocus-pocus and ridiculous ideas of heaven and hell, and, funnily enough, ghosts.""Ghost"" may have been more effective, if less popular, filmed straight down the line as a mystery-drama. Imagine: Pleasant love story takes a dark twist when Swayze is killed accidentally, or was he........You might say that would have been dull, but it would have saved the movie going off on a foolish tangent.Nevertheless, ""Ghost"" works well enough as a tear jerker, with a very funny performance by Whoopi Goldberg.

excellent movie of there time,This is such a great movie of the nineties. It's about the love between too people so strong. Then all of a sudden Sam gets shot for money and his spirit is set free to the mortal world. So basically he's trying to stop Carl from killing Molly and Oda Mae. Oda Mae (Whoopi Goldberg) made this movie happen with her witty humor and talent. She defiantly deserved that Oscar for her role. I hate Carl for betraying Sam the way he did. That was messed up. I love the chemistry between Oda Mae and Sam and how she had to help him to warn Molly. That was terrific. I love this movie so much. Best romantic comedy of the early nineties.

Good but not great,"I liked this movie but did not love it. The problem was 2 things. One rather major and one minor. The major thing is Whoopi Goldberg. Besides not liking her name and generally not liking her in general, she was funny at times but most of the time she overacted. The other thing was Demi Moore. Besides not liking her name (Ha ha ), I did not like her boy haircut. And there is something I don't really like about her that I cannot put my finger on. I think that haircut made it a little hard to believe that Patrick Swayze would be so enamored with her. Butch is the word.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ghost,"""Sam"" (Patrick Swayze) and his girlfriend ""Molly"" (Demi Moore) aren't the best at pottery, but they do know how to make a mess! A trip to the theatre to see the Scottish play doesn't end well though, as he is randomly attacked in the street. She's desolate but fortunately his work colleague ""Carl"" (Tony Goldwyn) is on hand to try to help her through the aftermath. What she doesn't know, though, is that ""Sam"" is stuck in limbo. He can't move on and so must watch her every day life unfold. Quickly, he realises that his old pal is keen on ""Molly"" and then, even worse, begins to suspect that his death wasn't quite as random as it might have seemed. How can he talk to her; warn her? Well that's where the star of the show comes in. ""Oda Mae"" (Whoopi Goldberg) is a medium who spends her time telling old widows that their long dead husbands still love them. She is ill-prepared to star in her own version of ""Blithe Spirit"", though, and that doesn't get any easier when she tries to convince ""Molly"" she is really in touch with ""Sam"" and that he is terrified that she may also be a target of a nefarious plot. The Righteous Brothers also have to take a share of the plaudits here as their ""Unchained Melody"" refrain helps set the scene for a romantic mystery that's peppered with some tea-time menace and a Goldberg who is at the top of her game. The plot itself isn't maybe the strongest and I'm glad I didn't have an account with his bank, but it's two hours that flies by keeping sentimentality and slapstick to a minimum and allowing the spirit of ""Madame Arcati"" to enter the 1990s enjoyably.

"Has its moments, but aged quickly and was undeserving of Oscar nominations","I first remember watching this in the early 2000s. I was in my young teens. I really enjoyed it and I had remembered most of its lines. And interestingly, even back then, it was rather campy and aged. But hey, I didn't mind. It is still one of those movies that age really fast. As time went by, I started to notice its flaws.Before getting to its quality, let's start with the music. It was, alongside the special effects, just campy and very 80's. The music was by Maurice Jarre, an artistic composer that was behind the epic films like Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago. The score of this film sounded like it was composed by some 80s synthpop band. Really superficial and synthetic suspense music that did NOT complement the beautiful orchestral theme music. I honestly expected the Terminator to pop up with that cheesy synthesized score during the chase scenes. I wonder, why would Jarre compose such music during the suspenseful sequences when he created a beautiful theme for this film? The two genres of music did NOT MESH well.Maybe they filmed it in the more retrograded locations in NYC, because it looked like it was made in 1985 or something. The costumes, the hair, etc. Very awkwardly dated. Only Demi Moore looked normal and modern. Speaking of dated, the special effects were horrendous. The screaming sounds of the ""demons"" were amateur at best. Like watching a low budget 1980s horror movie.Now Whoopi Goldberg was hilarious and amazing as Oda Mae. But was she really deserving of on Oscar? I would've given her a Golden Globe for Best Actress in Musical/Comedy. Definitely not an Oscar. Her character was a comic relief in nature, not much different than Chris Tucker in Rush Hour. I thought Demi Moore was more worthy. Those emotions and that sorrowful face really deserved an Oscar (IF you had to give this movie an Oscar though). I cried when she shed a tear. She was that contagious.As far as its multi-genres go, I wasn't a big fan of its genre mishmash. It should've either been a romantic drama, a mystery thriller or just a plain comedy. These genres just didn't mesh that well. Maybe the writer could've done it better. Because Titanic, another 1990s romance film, perfectly blended romance, drama, suspense and action.In conclusion, an alright movie with some nice, tearjerker moments towards the end backed up by the beautiful score (erm, not including the music behind the chase scenes). But totally undeserving of Oscar noms, especially Best Picture, considering its quality is just as good as an average 1980s/1990s TV movie. The critics were right to give it mixed reviews - And I rarely agree with critics.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good ghostly love.,"Not being a fan of love stories, and running away from anything schmaltzy, I knew what to expect when I watched this. In what is probably all of the main actor's defining roles, they produce a film that is quite good. It's the best love story film that I have seen, but admittedly, I haven't seen many. Its strong point is its central theme of Patrick Swayze as a ghost, trying to save his lover from danger, involving murder, theft and betrayal. Being a ghost, he has to try and help out without being able to touch anything, and be invisible except to other ghosts. As plots go, this isn't bad. However, as a spirit, he can conveniently interact with things in the real world. He can walk on floors and sit in chairs, and initially has a problem in going 'through' doors. Then he learns how to knock things over, and finds out that he can be heard through a medium. I expect that when this was initially being written, they probably reluctantly had to make him do these things in order for the story to work. I'm still not sure about the door thing though. The effects are pretty mediocre. Even at the time it was made, I'm sure they could have been better, especially when a 'baddie' dies. Cartoony wraiths come out of the ground and drag them away. It's all very unconvincing. It's not just a straight love story. There are elements of other genres as well, and they work. All in all, a rather good film.",,Anonymous,Romance
"textbook crowd-pleaser, for better or worse","Young Wall Street whiz kid Patrick Swayze is murdered but his spirit lingers on, earthbound until it can find the man who killed him and who still threatens bereaved girlfriend Demi Moore. You would think a dead man could afford to be fatalistic about such things, but Swayze wants revenge, and after a slow start (to both the film and his vendetta) he gets it, with reluctant help from a bogus medium (Whoopi Goldberg) able to hear his disembodied voice. The clever (and often eerie) effects help salvage the story from some predictable clichés and tired comic relief, and by the time Swayze joins that big Industrial Light and Magic show in the sky the film has carved itself a sizable chunk of territory once claimed exclusively by Steven Spielberg, who no doubt is kicking himself for making the similar but saccharine 'Always' instead. With a pair of more than simply photogenic stars the movie might have been a bubblegum classic; as it is, 'Ghost' succeeds in putting a warm afterglow around the afterlife.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's touching, thrilling, and other-worldly. Even if you're not a religious man, this film makes you believe in the afterlife, but only if you go to see a film, and suspend your disbelief.I know this is a relatively short review, but I hope it inspires people to check out the wonderful performances of Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and of course, Whoopi Goldberg.Having re-read my little review, it comes across as a political speech.

Is this only a romantic film?,"I watched this movie twenty years ago. It was too long ago. However, thinking of the movie 'Ghost' made by Jerry Zucker, first of all, I hit upon the clay- forming scene with a sweet melody. I can't help thinking of this as the most impressive and romantic scene among a lot of scenes. But is this only a romantic film?Sam (Patrick Swayze ) and his girlfriend, Molly (Demi Moore) move in an apartment together in New York. They really love each other. However, on the way home after watching the movie, Sam is robbed and murdered by a mugger. He doesn't go to the other side, with him becoming a ghost. He is kept on this world in the form of a ghost because of his love with Molly and the murderer who killed him. Soon he recognizes that a ghost can't communicate with people in this world. But he comes across a psychic, Oda Mae (Whoopi Goldberg) who can hear ghost's voice, contrary to ordinary people. With the help of her, Sam uncovers the truth behind the murder and saves Molly from danger. He finally leaves this world, assuring her that he loves her forever.I'd like to say this movie is a diverse genre. It shows a mixture of various elements that are difficult to categorize it into only one genre. First of all, it looks like a horror movie. The first scene starts at the dusty and foggy house with faint atmosphere. However, I changed my thought about that. Two lovers' fantastic and romantic clay-forming scene makes me sure that it is rather a romantic movie than a horror one. While most love stories are usually based on their conflicts and problems of their life in this world, it is a unique romantic movie that deals with a love story between a ghost of a dead person and his girl friend who lives in this world. Meanwhile, the murder that Sam was killed breaks out. Complicated plot is developed like a mystery in order to find a murderer and to save his lover. So, again I can think of it as a thriller and a mystery. Last, to solve the murder case, a psychic who plays a critical role in it is so comic and ridiculous that she can help me free my tension and fear. I can conclude it is a mystery and thriller and comedy.I'm also surprised to see the director, Jerry Zucker create his ghost who feels sorrowful and mournful, even though other directors have used a ghost as a horrible existence, a non-emotional or revengeful one. Exercising his imagination, he makes his movie fantastic and warm-hearted like a variety of gift sets. He also makes use of sweet music and arouses empathy between me and the ghost.The acting of Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore is very attractive to me. I can't forget their fantastic facial expressions with delicate emotion. They look like a real couple. Whoopi Goldberg won a Supporting Oscar as a psychic. I totally agree that her acting is excellent enough to get it. She shows a lot of comic acting and looks like a real cheesy fraud. She is too talkative but cute and sometimes childlike. She looks strong in personality but in fact, she is tender.The song, 'Unchained Melody' perfectly looks good on the clay-forming scene. The song is emotional and touching in itself. And then it stirs romantic emotion twice more than any other scenes do.The plot of it is too predictable, and at the last part it is rather too corny because there is a obvious structure of conflict between the good and the evil. Nevertheless, it gives tension to me until the criminal is found.Last, this shows too common a message about where the ghost of human beings go after death. The message is that good people go to heaven in the afterlife with mysterious and brilliant lights from the heaven and that on the contrary, bad people go to hell with dark shadowy lights. In spite of too clumsy a message, it still draws my attention.I watched it again last week. Even though too much time has gone by after my first watching, I still have a same opinion that it is touching and emotive. If you fall in love with someone or you want to love in the future, I strongly recommend you should watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Invisible man.,"'Ghost (1990)' is much more than its reputation would have you believe. That is to say, it's not just 'that movie where Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore get stuck into some clay'. It's a mystery-thriller with romantic aspects, much more concerned with its spooky situation than it is with its 'ooey gooey' stuff. Of course, the romance is still integral to the plot. It's also integral to your investment, as it ensures that you care about the central characters and the tragic events that they become involved with. It's interesting to see a ghost movie entirely from the perspective of the ghost. There's a unique sense of longing and frustration that comes with such an existential premise. It makes for some satisfying moments later on, once Swayze's leading man has learnt how to communicate with the land of the living. It also allows for some inventively delivered narrative twists. The special effects are still pretty great, especially when it comes to the 'going through things' stuff. Of course, its seams are starting to show but it's all still convincing enough to work. As are the performances, which are sometimes a little broad but are typically incredibly emotionally charged. The highlight for me is Tony Goldwyn, whose increasingly desperate decline is actually agitating to watch. All in all, the picture is surprisingly enjoyable. It has its problems, of course. Primarily, these occur whenever the comedy becomes too over-the-top for the established tone. The typically saccharine affair does sometimes teeter into straight-up sappiness, too. Despite this, the experience just works. It's emotional, exciting and unique. It's undeniably effective and downright entertaining, to boot. To be honest, it's really, really good. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An unchained melody of a film.,"After so many movies have made ghosts look evil, it probably was about time for a good ghost. In ""Ghost"", Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is murdered, only to discover that he is now a ghost - and hubby Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) can't see or hear him. Feeling bummed, he comes across medium Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), who can hear him. Through these connections, Sam is able to protect Molly after he realizes that her life is in danger.""Ghost"" is the sort of movie that one would expect to be little more than a sappy mess. But they did a good job with it. Whoopi Goldberg seems to be having an especially good time with her role, for which she won a well deserved Oscar. And that pottery scene? Not only does it make one truly appreciate the existence of ""Unchained Melody"", but ""Naked Gun 2 1/2: The Smell of Fear"" spoofed it.One more thing. I saw ""Ghost"" right after I had just seen ""The Sixth Sense"". There are some interesting similarities between the two. The obvious one is that they're both about ghosts (maybe also that one stars Demi Moore and the other stars Bruce Willis). But dig this: one was released at the beginning of the '90s, the other at the end of the '90s, and they were both the second highest-grossing movies of their years. Oh well.

Ghost is our story,"It is a story of good vs. Evil, a story of redemption and a story of what can bring about the damnation of the soul. The story focuses on two attractive young adults (Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore), so obviously in love, that even sudden tragedy can't end. Moore, at her softest and loveliest, is an aspiring sculptor, and Swayze is her Wall Street broker fiancée. Their closest friend (Tony Goldwyn) is supposedly their biggest supporter, but the fates prove otherwise. When Swayze is shot and killed in a botched robbery, he is immediately separated from the physical but remains on earth as part of a mission to protect Moore from on-going evils. Swayze locates a fake spiritualist (Whoopie Goldberg) whom he quickly realizes can hear everything he says and haunts her until she promises to help him warn the woman he loves.""You in danger, girl"", the Oscar Winning Goldberg tells her, and the skeptical Moore must fight reality and her need for communication from Swayze in order to go on with her life. The truth comes out quickly for the eternally awake Swayze who learns quickly the facts about being a ghost, first from a kindly old man whose spirit roams a hospital, and then from the angry ghost who fell off a train. The trains here are as much a character as Swayze, Moore and Goldberg are, tooting their horns as if a warning of evil premonitions. The J train/Myrtle Avenue stop is the location for where Swayze locates both his killer and Goldberg, and you can see him at various other New York City stops, learning the powers of being among the walking dead and jumping from moving train to moving train in order to locate the seemingly sinister ghost who initially screamed at him to ""Get off my train!"".Then, there's Tony Goldwyn, playing one of the great villains of movie history, showing that a lifetime of loyalty only can go so far in surviving the Wall Street game. Rick Aviles is his sinister partner in crime, a character so vile that you can't wait for him to get his come- uppance. That comes so suddenly and horrifically that the sensitive spiritual best be warned. It opens a lot of room for talk about what is beyond our control outside of the world we see around us and what makes for righteous and what makes for ruthlessness and selfishly motivated ambition. Aviles was a versatile actor who could play more than just a New York street thug, showing great sensitivity as a homeless man who shows kindness to Danny Glover and Matt Dillon in the underrated ""The Saint of Fort Washington"".",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Patrick Swayze does a great job as a ghost who not only seeks justice for his own murder but looks out for his true love and protects her from danger. The supernatural element of his character makes for an interesting and sometimes humorous film. His interactions with Whoopi Goldberg, the only person who can see him, are magical and hilarious. One might say he shares the most chemistry with her throughout the film.Throughout the film viewers are treated to an interesting conspiracy, the supernatural and good performances. Ghost also includes the immortal Unchained melody song in what is now a memorable film scene where Demi and Patrick bond in the pottery scene. It is a simple and well told story that does not seek to over complicate Swayze's supernatural presence and viewers can go along with his journey because his story is far from over.

"Dramatically powerful, but marred by excessive comic relief","The film blends some divergent genre styles, and mostly succeeds. Where the film goes wrong is in too much ambition to be all things to all people, and in so doing, diminishes its own viability. The entire Oda Mae charlatan/psychic side line is distracting; Whoopi Goldberg plays her comic relief part way over the top, and draws far too much attention to herself. Somebody must have thought ""Believers in the paranormal will like this, but let's pander to the skeptics by letting them laugh at it, and then they'll like it too."" However, the self-jabbing sequence is executed awkwardly. This leaves the film with a confused identity, lost somewhere in a void between 6th Sense and Ghostbusters.Patrick Swayze plays his part well, except in scenes with Whoopi, where he gets oddly comedic. This makes her the focus, even though the tragic circumstances of his murder parting him forever from his love should be the cornerstone of the story. Demi Moore's acting is better than it usually is, but what's up with that hair of hers? She looks like she's going trick-or-treating as Ringo Starr. Most of the remaining cast are pretty decent, except for the dead souls that haunt Whoopi. They were just annoying.The plot develops well, and the memorably haunting ""Unchained Melody"" theme was the perfect choice. The eerie black shadow creatures, with their shrill howling and blindly malevolent behavior, were suitably demonic in their design.

Decent film,"Decent film. Swayze shows that a Wall Street broker doesn't have to be a ruthless cheat or a non-feeling corporate S. O. B., yet he isn't perfect either, as evidenced in the somewhat sick scene with Goldwyn on the elevator where they play a prank on the stone- faced passengers that is delicious payback for those of us who have dealt with corporate coldness and the evils of office politics. Moore is a total winner here, absolutely gorgeous, and the epitome of what a true lady is. Her sadness over loosing the love of her life never makes you feel sorry for her, but you empathize with her. Jerry Zucker, the man behind ""Airplane!"" and ""The Naked Gun"" movies, proves to be a brilliant dramatic storyteller, even if he comically spoofed the famous ""Unchained Melody"" sequence in the first ""Naked Gun"".6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie is already a classic.,"This ultra-romantic film addresses two main themes: the power of love and the afterlife. The title may deceive, make us think that is another horror film about hauntings. Well ... it's about ghosts but does not scare anyone. The script is based on the sudden death of Sam and in his attempts to contact his wife, now widow, and warn her about a deadly danger lurking around her. Simple but effective, the script works well, plays with a universal belief, shared by millions of people, places deep questions and earned for its author, Bruce Joel Rubin, an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay.The main roles are played by Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore, two experienced actors who don't have disappointed the public, providing us with very good performances. They have created a good visual chemistry, which helps to enhance the romantic mood of the film. Compelling is the performance of Whoopi Goldberg, one of the most striking of her career. She gave life to a funny medium that starts to be a fraud. The film also features several innovative special effects, for the time, and look good on the screen.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
very tear jerking,Ghost is one of the most sad and beautiful romance movie of all time.This was a real tear jerker. The performance were excellent. The music was beautiful. This was a powerful movie that teaches us a good lesson. Love is forever. How many movies out there deal with a love so great that it goes on even after your dead. I mean Sam loved Molly so much that even when he was dead his love never changed. I believe this movie is one of a kind.I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a very touching and beautiful romance movie.,,Anonymous,Romance

"""You're dead, Willy.""","I don't know why but this is my favourite movie of all time... Wait, I do know why I like it so much. It just came to me. The actors were really good and correctly cast, I think. The plot made sense and the characters were believable. It's a little known fact that lots of comediennes's favourite movies are actually thrillers. My favourite movie is this and it's also a thriller too. How bizarre... Sam Wheat (Swayzee) is in love and has moved in with his girlfriend, Molly. (Moore) What he doesn't know is that his friend Carl is about to betray him. Whoopi Goldberg puts humour into this black storyline to create a lighter feel to the movie which I think is good to have. This movie kept me hooked the whole time. Dead on great film. I give it 10 stars. I also urge anyone out there to see 'Point Break' another one of Swayzee's films.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Clever, charming, totally in command of some weird material...","Whether or not we believe that in the afterlife we're all very much concerned with unfinished business and can simply contact a medium when we want to get in touch with the physical world, GHOST is a complete charmer from beginning to end.It all starts when a couple of yuppies (PATRICK SWAYZE and DEMI MOORE) are strolling back to their luxurious apartment one night. He's an investment counselor and his digs are something to kill for. However, that's not the reason he's murdered by thugs in an alley. Seems he's been on to a laundering scheme by some black market investors and it's a contract killing.Well, you can't keep a good man down and soon Swayze is interacting, at first in minor ways, with the living but is frustrated enough in trying to reach his wife so that he contacts WHOOPI GOLDBERG, a fake medium who has no idea that she is indeed able to hear words from Swayze until he starts prompting her and giving her information about him that only he and his wife know in order to convince Moore to pay attention to him. As one of the bad men involved in the investment scheme, TOM GOLDWYN gives a funny, terrific performance in a key supporting role. Much of the humor comes from his work and, of course, Whoopi, who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her insolent supporting role, as well as a Golden Globe.Whatever, it all works even though it seems highly preposterous when you stop to think about it. But the lines are so clever, the interaction between ghosts and real people so inventive, and the climax so satisfying that you can't help admiring how the screenwriters were able to take a very difficult subject and turn it into one of the smartest comedy/drama achievements of the year.Summing up: Highly recommended for some good chills and lots of laughs.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"This Is NOT A Horror, More Of A Romantic One","I decided to watch this one again after so many years. It is indeed one of my favourite Whoopi Goldberg movies. She's WONDERFUL in this. I loved her work since 'Colour Purple' and 'Jumpin' Jack Flash'. In 'Ghost', she plays a medium named Oda Mae Brown who may not have people's best interests in heart and she gets entangled in a sheme that gets people killed. I hope you will watch this film, since it does have Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore in this. The story follows a banker by the name of Sam Wheat who is in love with Molly, played by Moore. I really appreciated how she was able to immerse herself in her character, with the late Swayze's becoming more and more emotionally tied to her, but Sam's friend Carl, played excellently by Tony Goldwyn, eventually shows his true colours and they discover that he was not to be trusted.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ghost Review,"Ghost follows Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) after his murder as he uncovers the truth. He seeks help from the psychic Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg) as he tries to save his girlfriend (Demi Moore) from the same fate.A romantic fantasy suspense movie, it blends love, loss, and supernatural suspense in a well-crafted movie. There are some primitive special effects, which work flawless for this 1990 film. The cinematography and acting are great and the chemistry of the different personalities works quite well. Compared to 2024 beauty standards, Patrick Swayze is slim and trim compared to today's big and bulky. This is a cable classic for a reason.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
...So what can a ghost do afterall?,"It is one of the few times i rate a rather light movie less than the overall rating. This movie has many flaws, according to me. I mean...the movie turns around from the things a ghost can or cannot do. So, from the movie we see that a ghost cannot touch people or make them feel its presence. They cannot hear it. Additional, a ghost cannot touch material things, such as doors, unless it concetrates hard. Yet, we can see the ghost walking on the road, walking on the floor of its house, taking the stairs (!!!!) to go to the next floor. We can see it jump...so does GRAVITY affect ghosts? What are they made of then? Don't get me wrong, im not the kind of guy that would search a movie for flaws to judge it, and i have enjoyed many films about ghosts and other supernatural things. But, in this movie, i could not understand what the ghost could do. It couldn't touch a door to open, it could walk right through it. OK. Yet, he couldn't walk through the walls? Or worse, through the floors? Or he could sit on a couch???? Could he feel the material things, yes or no??? There is a difference between claiming the ghost can move things with the power of its mind, soul or whatever, and claiming a ghost can naturally walk, jump, feel the wall but not the door, pass through the wall of the train and land on the floor of it??? (pardon my English). Those mistakes, can naturally be made since we are dealing with supernatural things, but if they ruin the whole point of the movie, then yes it affects the way im gonna rate it.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good film,"I did find a some clever or satisfying bits in the film, like the floating penny, some of Swayze's learning curve of what he can do as a ghost, and the idea of the demons dragging evil-doers to their ultimate punishment (although the special effects fail here).It's sounds like I despised this film, but I still gave it a 6 because despite its many flaws, it still entertains and the flaws aren't as glaring on the first viewing.

Sam tries to save Molly from dire circumstance with the help of the hesitant Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), a gifted psychic.The majority of the film's great success is owed to the magnificent and electric on-screen chemistry created between Swayze and Moore as the two torn lovers.

Good but not the best film of all time,"'Ghost' is a good film, but it is not the greatest film of all time. In its day, it was a huge success to the point where it was much over-rated.In short, the film is about a woman (Demi Moore) who comes to terms with her lover's death, and he returns as a ghost while she still clings on and lives a pretty sad existence for a while while her deceased lover is determined to save her from a similar doom. (It's highly emotional in places. One of the best and most quoted scenes is the scene where Demi's character is creating and molding a clay pot.) Coupled with excellent cinematography and pacing and actors/actresses, this film is worth a watch because it succeeds in conveying its emotion from the screen to our hearts.

Brilliant and Perfect.,"It's an awesome movie about the love between Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore's characters. Whoopi Goldberg is Whoopi.This movie is comparable to Casablanca. The directing and editing is wonderful. Great plot. Not usually a big fan of supernatural but this is a big exception.Besides being a romantic comedy, and supernatural movie, it has aspects of drama and adventure.The movie completely captures the viewer's interest and attention throughout. There's really only four main characters and it's easy to follow the plot. Sometimes I find movies have too many characters and subplots, and I end up having to look things up in Wikipedia to see what I've missed.In closing, I would say that, like Casablanca, if they do a remake, it will not be anywhere as good as this 1990's original.Full disclosure-I am a baby boomer.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I like it!,"""Ghost,"" marked a departure for director Jerry Zucker, known for comedic fare, showcasing a more serious side. It also propelled Demi Moore into leading lady status and solidified Patrick Swayze's heartthrob reputation. Whoopi Goldberg's performance even earned her an Academy Award. The film briefly made pottery alluring and revitalized the popularity of the Righteous Brothers.For those unfamiliar, ""Ghost"" follows the story of an investment banker living with his artist girlfriend in a spacious New York City loft. After he is fatally shot in a robbery, he remains tethered to the earthly realm, desperate to protect his love and uncover the truth behind his demise, aided by a fraudulent psychic (Goldberg).While ""Ghost"" may be regarded as sentimental and melodramatic, its enduring appeal lies partly in Demi Moore's compelling portrayal. She infuses the film with raw emotion, anchoring it in themes of grief and acceptance. Despite its occasional cheesiness and dated effects, the narrative unfolds deliberately, allowing time for character development and exploration of the supernatural elements.The chemistry between Swayze and Moore adds depth to the central romance, making their separation genuinely poignant. Goldberg injects humor into the mix. Nevertheless, the film's blend of mystery, romance, and supernatural intrigue still resonates.In essence, ""Ghost"" remains surprisingly engaging, transcending its origins as a fast-food giveaway to stand as a testament to its enduring storytelling and performances.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Patrick Swayze was romantically emotional and heroic in this movie.This movie brings many emotions to the viewer. It's nice to think of those who have passed away being right there with us still. A tear jerker for sure.
If you've ever lost a loved one and want to believe there's still life after death remember the love we share with one another lives on. This movie proves that. Love is everything , Love is beyond all. This movie in fact upheld the victory of love and hope.
It does make you think about your personal relationships as they stand now, and to value them.So many genres in this film blend together so perfectly to create this.

This film is not a crock....,"I must start this review with two words, Sam Wheat. Unbelievable that this film was released way back in 1990. Starring Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg. At the time the late Patrick Swayze was at a career zenith after successful films such as Dirty Dancing and Roadhouse.The best casting in this film however in my opinion has to be Whoopi Goldberg as Spiritualist Oda Mae Brown. The story is basically about a banker, Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) who is brutally murdered for his computer password to allow a supposed friend Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn) to steal $4m. Wheat leaves behind a loving partner Molly Jensen (Demi Moore). Swayze finds himself a ghost working out the treachery that lead to his murder. His only way of communicating is by interesting Brooklyn Spiritualist Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg).The film follows Sams ghostly story as he thwarts Carl's dastardly scheme and attempts to heal the greiving Molly. Director Jerry Zucker brings an interesting story to the screen. The film has aged slightly with some questionnable special effects and computers.

A classic for the family,"Banker Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is murdered. He returns as a ghost and ask for help to Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), a medium who can hear him, to avenge his killer and save his wife, Molly Jensen (Demi Moore).Ghost was one of the most popular films of the 1990s. Even today, over 30 years after its release, it is frequently rerun on cable channels. Much is due to the excellent pace. That mixes drama, comedy, fantasy and suspense in just 127 minutes. It's an enjoyable experience to watch with the family.Whoopi Goldberg is fantastic as Oda Mae Brown, a role that won her the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1991. She is the real star of the movie. The soundtrack is excellent. The old hit ""Unchained Melody"" (1965) fit perfectly into the sculpture sequence, which is the legacy that Ghost left in popular culture.The biggest flaw of the film is the little development of the couple. Swayze and Moore loved each other and that's all. Their motivation is somewhat superficial and the protagonists have little personality. Ghost would greatly benefit from less one-dimensional protagonists. The action scenes also needed better choreography. Some chases and fights look a bit amateurish by modern standards.A must see for those who like the genre and a pleasant experience for the general public. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

We all have relatives we've known who are now dead and we can relate to the pain of loosing a loved one.  But this movie shows something beyond that death.  Love beyond the grave, and it just impacts you.

OK, good. Once Swayze's character is killed, the story picks up. Swayze performs well as Wheat, his grief and his anger bubble on Swayze's face. When Whoopi Goldberg pops into the story as Oda Mae Brown, she provides a bit of entertainment but I know she's capable of more. Moore is great at the emotional side of Molly, but doesn't do much more than that. Vincent Schiavelli pops up as a poltergeist haunting the subways in New York, probably the most interesting character. A little bit of imagination gives Schiavelli's character incredible depth. The way Swayze interacts (or rather doesn't) with the other characters is very well executed, and requires good acting chops from all involved. The pacing is good but writing a bit sloppy.There is a reason the only thing anyone ever thinks of from this film is the clay scene.

Very Touching and Romantic!,"Ghost is one of the best romance stories ever made and it is not hard to see why this film became an instant classic. I liked the spin to the eons-old romance tale by introducing the afterlife aspect. This film works very well as a romance story as well as a mystery thriller and it has one of the most happy-sad endings I have ever seen in a Hollywood film. The film also work its magic through the use of music thanks to Maurice Jarre's wonderful score and the use of the Righteous Brothers.Jerry Zucker's film is about a couple named Sam and Molly who are happily in love. During a botched mugging, Sam is shot to death. Sam comes back as a ghost and he realizes that he was murdered and that Molly is in danger. With the help of a reluctant psychic, Sam must communicate with his wife if he wants to protect her.Each actor added some dimension to their roles. Firstly, the chemistry between Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore is very believable and realistic. They both do a great job in their roles. I was particularly fond of Swayze and his attempts to communicate with the real world. Whoopi Goldberg does a wonderful job as the psychic not wanting to do with the events. Tony Goldwyn made a good villain, even if he was a little bit of a scaredy-cat.Overall, Ghost is a 90's classic and I really hope this film won't be a victim of the remakes craze that has been infesting upon Hollywood these days. The film is a mixture of mystery and romance and it delivers a touching story without being overly saccharine. I find this film the second most touching romance of the 90's after Titanic.

Getting the Red Carpet Treatment.,"""Ghost"" is a good film, but did it deserve a Best Picture nomination in 1990? Well, I would lean towards the answer no. The Oscar-winning original screenplay deals with a man (Patrick Swayze) who has been brutally murdered and is now an earthly spirit trying to protect his lover (Demi Moore) from those who ended his life. Along for the ride is a wise-cracking would-be psychic (Oscar-winner Whoopi Goldberg) who acts as the medium between Swayze and Moore. The film was a box office smash and was a slight triumph with the critics. ""Ghost"" just never really quite did it for me though. Harsh issues throughout are then overshadowed by scenes of humor and romance. The tone is somewhat uneven and the supernatural aspect is overplayed. Still a good picture, but somewhat over-rated. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Romance
Lacks substance,"It would have made a good half-hour ""Twilight Zone"" episode. Unfortunately, there just isn't enough story to last a full two hours; as a result the movie looks, and is, padded-out. Mediocre performances from Swayze and Moore overwhelm Goldberg's considerable contribution.If you want a good ""life-after-death"" movie see Spielberg's Always (1989) which is far, FAR more restrained in it's handling of similar material.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful story of fantasy and love mixed with comedy,"Ghost was a movie that nobody wanted, the studio wanted two big names for the lead but no stars like the script, they picked two slightly unknown actors (Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze), the script was rewritten, the studio did not like the finished movie and put it on the shelf to collect dust, the studio brought in a different head of production and he discovered Ghost, as did we all. Ghost is lighting in a bottle, perfect acting jobs by three people in Hollywood that get no respect, (Moore, Swayze, and Whoopi Goldberg. A wonderful story of fantasy and love mixed with comedy. The music was wonderful and fit the movie perfect. Ghost would not have been as good without the ending, it will make you cry and think about the afterlife. 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very touching,"Congratulations to the director of this fine movie because he/she did a real fine job. In times when movies are all action and violence, Ghost tells us that there is hope for mankind...somewhere...somehow...it's not a religious thing and the movie doesn't try to push that either. There is more than one touching scene and the actors and actresses played their roles perfectly. Demi Moore fits in very well and you can see her liking the part all the way thru. Schwayze is fantastic too and is able to turn from the more 'violent' scenes to the mellow ones without any problems at all. The scenery of the movie is well-chosen too.

I just couldn't see what the hype was all about,"Okay, so we had the late Patrick Swayze here in his prime and Demi Moore in the beginning of hers. And not to mention the incredibly unfunny Whoopi Goldberg thrown in as a token element in the mix.Now I'm not saying I am being heartless in a review of a film countless number of people loved and adored, it's just I can't understand what the hype was or the romantic meaning of the storyline was. My ex-wife loved it, but I saw nothing remotely interesting that would catch my attention.My reasoning behind the 4 out of 10 star rating is for the soundtrack and not-too-shabby acting, although Demi Moore looks like she was so attention-starved it was almost too funny.

I watch it over and over!,"This is one of those movies I watch over and over--no matter at what point I find it, I settle down and watch it. As another viewer said, this movie has it all--love, humor, violence-- and best of all, the good guys win! I think it's the best thing Demi and Patrick have done (I admit I haven't seen all their work), and I think Demi should wear her hair that way all the time--to me, it's much more becoming than her later long styles. I was so happy to learn that Whoopi won an Oscar for her performance--she was funny and scared and puzzled and all the things Oda Mae would have been. I've just reviewed the list of awards this film won, and believe it deserved every one of them. As the loathsome Carl, Tony Goldwyn should probably have won one of the awards too, because he did a great portrayal of the classic coward, the type who tries cozying up to someone to get what he wants the easy way, but has no way of coping with problems except to go kill someone or hire it done for him. I'm glad the dark spirits got him too! In all, a very satisfying movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
So many genres blend together so seamlessly. Perfection.,"Probably one of the most romantic and emotionally charged films I've seen. Interestingly enough, it is also hilariously funny (mostly thanks to Whoopi Goldberg) and suspenseful. When the film was first released, the industry was skeptical about the film due to the many elements mixed together: comedy, romance, action, fantasy, suspense....

A Lot More Going On Here Than Some Will Give It Credit For,"Ghost (1990)*** (out of 4)After being murdered, a man's spirit (Patrick Swayze) remains on Earth to look after his fiancé (Demi Moore) as well as try and find out why he was killed. The only one who can see him is a fake future teller (Whoopi Goldberg) who reluctantly agrees to help his cause. It's easy to see why GHOST made so much money when it was originally released and why it remains so popular to this day. No, it's not a CITIZEN KANE and it's not a film that's ground-breaking but in regards to pure entertainment it pretty much delivers on all levels. Yes the story is fairly simple but it allows for some great performances, good direction and several very memorable scenes, which is more than enough for a film like this. There's no doubt that the film wouldn't have been as strong had it not been for the terrific cast with all of them fitting their roles perfectly. Swayze offers up one of his best performances as he has to hit several emotional levels throughout the picture and he does it with ease. It's very easy to connect with him and this allows you to care about what's going on and want to see him get his revenge as well as protect the one he loves. I think Moore gets the least flashy character in the film but she still makes a very good love target and there's no question that she's got a rich chemistry with Swayze. The same is true for Goldberg who shines in her Oscar-winning performance. She certainly brings this serious film a lot of needed comic relief and there's really no one else that could have done this part so well. Tony Goldwyn is perfect as the sleazy villain and there's no doubt that he deserved a lot more attention and credit for making the film as good as it is. Everyone remembers the Unchained Melody love sequence and it's certainly a very memorable but there are other great scenes scattered throughout the picture. GHOST isn't a masterpiece but it's about as good as you could hope in a film like it. Director Jerry Zucker deserves a lot of credit for being able to mix up the drama, romance and comedy as well as he did.",,Anonymous,Romance
One of those movies that ages poorly,"Well, i just got done watching this movie for the first time. in 2 years this movie will be 20 years old. that's scary.first of all, i have to say i did want to see this movie because of hearing how popular it was in its day... that was then. this is now.i'll be honest - i thought this movie was OK, on the better side of average - however there are two noticeable problems: the ""special"" effects, and Patrick swayze.first of all - i haven't seen to many movies featuring swayze, but i guess luckily so. i thought his performance had one or two good moments - basically whenever he shared screen time with whoopi. overall, however, i was literally cringing. his reaction to his dead body, passing through a doctor's head, etc. all made me just frown in uncomfortableness. i think any actor could have given this character more life and reality behind it.the special effects... well... i know you'll say - ""you're being contradictory! you SAID this was made 20 years ago! don't be so judgmental!"" OK - whatever... Jurassic Park came out like two years later - and those visual effects are still as amazing as ever! i think this movie gave very little time and effort in regards to the effects, therefore... they suck... why do we need to know or see that when you're a ghost and you pass through someone's head, you can somehow see all the tiny blood cells and veins inside?! unnecessary... pointless...i think the only redeeming part of this movie was whoopi Goldberg - who is a genius! i thought her performance 100% deserved her Oscar and am so proud that she won. the humor she instills in her character just breathes life into an otherwise dreadfully dull movie. i actually laughed out loud at one or two of whoopi's lines! ha ha!basically - GHOST was OK, definitely not Oscar-worthy at all (except whoopi!), not even deserving of all 5 of its nominations! overrated, dated, cliché, white noise in terms of movies in general.******/********** (6/10) i don't recommend this title, unless you're a fan of whoopi and you're ready to sit through bland movie to see her...",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not better the second time around,"There are some films you enjoy seeing a second time - or even more. This flick is not one of them for me.I remember reading a reviewer's comment about Patrick Swayze (I believe Leonard Maltin, either regarding this movie or ""Dirty Dancing"") describing Swayze's acting range ""from A to B.""That, plus the fact that upon seeing this movie again, after a long passage of time, I realized how summarily unappealing the characters and performances were in this picture. You can't have a more fictional premise than the lead character and others walking around while dead - but, nevertheless, there should have been some evidence of just what the hell Swayze did in his supposed high-finance job. Tony Goldwyn seemed to know more than Swayze, but his efforts seemed solely centered on money laundering, the crux of the story.Whoopi Goldberg provided nothing funny, or even the least bit believable - especially in the scene where her bizarre character bumbled her way through drawing a bank check for multi-millions, from the manager, with less effort detailed than you'd have cashing a small check in your home bank, where you know everyone and appear twice a week.Despite the steamy scene with both leads drenching themselves with the soft, wet clay which Demi Moore was sculpting, there was zero chemistry between the two lovebirds. And the enjoyment of this scene was simply demonstrating two very attractive persons in a rather unusual, spontaneous romantic interlude. Beyond that, even this scene lacked any ""chemistry,"" or even a trace of emotion on Swayze's part.The nature of this story is worth perhaps a 7* rating for viewing it the first time - but 4* is generous for a subsequent one.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

I love to the actors in this movie and I thought every one of them really nailed their performance. Whoopi Goldberg won her academy award for her supporting performance in this movie, she's funny and delightful as the medium who really isn't aware of her abilities until Patrick Swayze comes into her life. And let me just say that I absolutely adored Demi Moore's performance here, she is one of the best on cue criers I've seen in movies, when she cries in that touching scene where she finally gets to come into contact with her dead boyfriend, it's just the most romantic thing ever and it's her acting that makes it work so well. The actors have great chemistry with one another, Swayze and Goldberg work well on screen and are funny and Demi and Patrick have incredible romantic connection. The visual effects are stunning, especially for back in 1990, that's one of the things this film was praised for back then.

Great!!!,"This is one of my top 50 favorite movies. Everybody is great in it from Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore to Whoppi Goldberg.

For some reason Wheat is still walking the Earth, now in ghost form. He follows Mollie and finds that the killer was really after a password that he had to authorize funds transfers through the bank. Now Mollie is also in danger from the killers and Sam feels helpless.Sam then happens upon Goldberg, who is running a scam as a medium who can communicate with the dead. Apparently, Goldberg can hear Sam talk so Sam uses Goldberg to try to communicate with Mollie and warn her of danger.Sam then realizes that the only way to protect Mollie is to be able to use some sort of physical force. The only problem is as a ghost he has no physical substance so he cannot touch anything. Or can he? Sam learns that maybe he can touch objects when he encounters another ghost who is able to do just that. The other ghost turns out to be one of the most entertaining characters of the film.The movie has it all from a love story, to excellent comedy, fairly decent special effects and a great story.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Life after death? Hmmm...,"I first saw this movie when I was about 12 years old. It's one of the few movies that I've evr watched that I continue to watch faithfully to this day.It really makes you think about the question, ""is there really life after death?""Whether it's a belief that one goes to Heaven or Hell, or whether the spirit if reincarnated on earth, or is death simply, the end?Who knows. This movie will make you think about it.So think about the next time you're alone and that door closes by itself, or that light clanks on and off, are you really alone?However this movie was not meant to be scary at all, which is what I thought when I first heard the title.  It's actually the touching story of a murdered man named Sam who refuses to leave his fiance's side, even in death.Molly is of course, oblivious to his prescence.He enlists in the help of psychic Oda Mae Brown (played by Whoopi Goldberg, and her performance alone is reason enough to catch this flick), to his surprise he finds out really can hear him (after she's been ripping off all her customers who want to contact departed loved ones.His fiance (Demi Moore) is of course a bit reluctant to believe some stranger who shows up at her door telling her that she's talking to her dead boyfriend.Even after Brown reveals things to Molly that only her and Sam knew and many of their most private moments, she's still somewhat unconvinced.Finally she does become convinced and agrres to let Brown in.Sam wants to warn Molly that his best friend had him murdered and that she could be next.Probably the most touching part of the film is when Oda Mae lets Sam ""use her body"" so that he and Molly can hold each other one last time.It all comes to a head when Sam's best friend confronts Molly and Brown and Sam is there to protect them from beyond the grave. Carl, (Sam's friend [with pals like that who needs enemies?]) is impaled on glass during the melee and he dies. And after seeing his own body he's taken away by the shadow ghosts (probably the only half-way scary part of the whole film).And in closing, Molly somehow can finally hear Sam as he tells her goodbye and goes into the light.I love this film.I think I'll go watch it now.",,Anonymous,Romance

Worth Watching Just to Watch Whoopie!,"With an opportunity to see the Broadway production of the musical, I thought it would be good to revisit the original with my family. I saw this in a movie theater on its first run and came away with some mixed feelings. I guess if you accept the premise that one can be caught in a kind of purgatory, stuck between heaven and hell, then you can also accept that there are demons that come up from hell and pull the bad guys down. I thought that a less clichéd view of the spiritual cosmos and not a hackneyed Dante-esque one would have been more effective, but then I have no belief in fire pits and angels playing harps. The story itself is quite fun with Patrick Swayze killed so that his trusted colleague can embezzle money, using accounts Swayze has access to. Swayze lives with Demi Moore (who is a knockout) and they have had trouble committing. Once dead, he is able to move about and observe all that is happening. He also becomes part of a fraternity of dead people stuck in the same place (apparently, they haven't settled their scores). As he watches he realizes that his lover is in danger from his murderer and his ""friend."" Swayze engages a medium, played by Whoopie Goldberg in an Academy Award performance, to try to connect with Demi. She can hear him, but can't see him. It takes time for him to break down the barriers of distrust and apprehension (what would we do?). He learns from one of the other dead guys how to make things move through mental effort, and he uses this to his advantage. Of course, one has to mention the famous scene with the sculpting of the gigantic phallic symbol while the Righteous Brothers sing ""Unchained Melody."" The other memorable scene is the one where Whoopie is in the bank and Swayze is telling her what to say as she withdraws four million dollars from an account. It's certainly worth a look if you've not seen it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty good,"Ghost is one of the rare films that can appeal to both men and women...there are fights, blood, gore, comedy, drama, romance, mystery, music, and intrigue.

All the actors here, including Vincent Schavelli (who I recognized right away as Mr. Vargas from Fast Times at Ridgemont High) as the subway ghost are great.My favorite scene would be the vase-making then love-making scene set to Unchained Melody, which in my opinion is one of the greatest love songs ever. I really didn't agree with the spiritual, life after death issues displayed in the movie, and I did think the ending could have been better. Other than that, the film wasn't bad.

"A film beyond words, although I'll supply many","Although often marginalized by my contemporaries, colleagues, and the world of academia at large, the character of Ode May Brown is one of the most riveting, pivotal, and important literary characters of the past two centuries and quite possibly ever.

The 1980's, similar to 1923, was a time of prosperity, indulgence, and limitless thinking.

"Million buck movie, don't miss it.","This. Is. The Best. Movie ever!!! I don't have a favorite movie (so many, how to choose) but this would probably be it. It has sci-fi, suspense, horror, action, drama, romance, sex, comedy, every thing. You're cringing, then crying, then laughing your butt off. Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore play two lovers torn apart by death, seriously making you cry. While Patrick and Whoopi banter and argue to make the funniest scenes. You have your bad guys, the slimy and the scary, but yauaugh, the ending is a bit gross- be warned. But still, you cannot miss this movie, it is sooo gooood. The ending is a big tear bringer, with the saddest song and the even sadder goodbye... I've watched parts of the movie so many times. It's a winner.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great tear-jerker,"Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore are perfectly cast as lovers in this film. Whoopi Goldberg as the Psychic is absolutely fantastic. The remainder of the cast also put in great performances. The film is about the ghost of a murdered man (Swayze) who is trying to protect his love (Moore) from the villian. He contacts the psychic (Goldberg) and uses her for various parts of his plan. Demi Moore's work in this film is about the best I have ever seen from her. The story moves along at a fairly decent clip, although there are a couple of short periods where I thought it dragged just a bit. The musical score is very good, with a stroke of brilliance in using the old Righteous Brothers Unchained Melody. Overall, a very well done flick and definitely worth a watch. I have read several other people's comments and I will join them in saying that I found that my eyes were leaking some sort of strange moisture after seeing this film. Well done!",,Anonymous,Romance
"""Ghost"" - Do you believe?","The best thing that can be said about ""Ghost"" is that it's starkly earnest in the portrayal of two people whose love for one another is boundless, not even by death. So when Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) coos to her yuppie boyfriend Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) that she loves him, to which he dimly replies ""Ditto,"" it's genuine romance - it's the real McCoy.""Ghost"" was the romantic hit of 1990 and was directed amiably by Jerry Zucker (of ""Airplane!"" infamy) and written by Bruce Joel Rubin, who also scripted ""Jacob's Ladder"" that same year, which was another film that questioned the paranormal activity that is life after death. ""Ghost"" contains many of the comedic elements on display in Zucker's earlier ""Airplane!"" hit but remains pretty loyal to the seriousness of its subject matter.Sam has led a pretty charmed life: he has a beautiful girlfriend, a trustworthy friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn), a well-paying job as a Wall Street banker, and a brand-spanking new apartment with the woman he loves. But Sam's charmed life comes to an abrupt end one night when he's gunned down during an attempted robbery by Willie Lopez (Rick Aviles) - ""he's Puerto Rican.""But the movie's not over, as Sam is left to roam the streets of New York City alone and without any way to communicate with the living. He can't be seen or heard by living people, so he spends his days walking the streets and watching carefully over the grieving Molly as she attempts to piece together her life without him. Between doing this and that, Sam eventually learns the identity of his assailant and where he lives but cannot do anything about it.But when all hope seems lost, Sam wanders into a shop run by a storefront psychic named Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress), who likes to swindle grieving people out of their money by convincing them that she can talk with the dead. It's from their dynamic interactions that much of the film's comedic elements are derived.Oda Mae is shocked when she finds that she really can hear Sam (but can't see him) and he uses her as a medium so that he can communicate with Molly and inform her that she's in danger. (He's able to convince Oda Mae to help him by singing ""Henry the Eight I Am."") Sam, with Oda Mae's help, gradually learns that his death was no random street mugging, and that he was murdered: Willie had been instructed by a mysterious third party to kill Sam and then retrieve his wallet, as he was on the verge of uncovering a money laundering scheme involving drug dealers.""Ghost"" does boast one of the most compelling and moving love stories ever told. The story is effective and is certainly a revealing and engaging look at the afterlife. The acting is powerful and profound, as each of the performers fill out their roles with perfect glee and believable emotions. The special effects are dated, but are also quite effective as well in showing us the processes in the afterlife, as it turns out that spirits can interact with the living and doesn't even attempt to spare us the darker sides of death.Since Sam lacks a physical human body, he cannot move objects. But with the help of the tragic ghost (Vincent Schiavelli) that haunts the New York subway, Sam is able to physically interact with the living. He learns that by controlling one's emotions and then letting them erupt like a reactor, he can physically move an animate or inanimate object.Do you believe in ghosts? I believe in karma, and I do believe in life after death. These are all elements in the story that are fleshed out well in Rubin's imaginative script, brought to life by the actors and the guidance of Zucker's direction. I do believe that the ladies might need tissues to wipe away the tears too, as the film's ending would prove.""Ghost,"" I believe, is one of the best love stories I've ever seen. It's funny, it's heartwarming, and it's all done in a believable fashion. Love is grand, and it's forever; ""Ghost"" will make you believe.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

This movie is the first time that Zucker try a more serious story to direct. Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg make excellence performances in this picture.

Good entertainment... never mind about the rest!,"I love this movie, and no matter how many times I see it (and no matter how many more flaws I see each time), I will continue to think of it as a good, kind of sad/poignant, and very interesting thing to watch.   It's one of those well-known movies that can easily be referred to as a ""classic,"" when maybe the acting and directing weren't perfect, or the storyline was flawed, or whatever.. I've heard this referred to as a ""chick flick,"" which I don't necessarily agree with, as those kinds of movies typically sicken me, but if it is one, it's one of the best I've seen!  (I didn't care for some of the make-out scenes though... especially the one where it was really him in Whoopi Goldberg's body... I mean, could you really ignore that if you were in that situation?)  And Unchained Melody is so beautiful.... You won't see me get this mushy over much else!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
This was a very good film,"This story had it all - comedy, heartbreak, love and very good elements besides such as the murder plot which was very well done, but there could've been a few more suspects to choose from and since we're already down to two to begin with - Willy and Carl, there's no real surprise when it transpires that Carl is in league with Willy and they murdered Sam, or at least conspired to. But it's never really made clear whether Sam was accidentally killed.Excellent performances all round - not just Whoopi - though the bank scene where she realizes she's going to get $4 million is just one of the highlights of the film. Of course, with any film, there's going to be some dull points. However, they are kept to a minimum and as this film, like many others, is almost unbelievable some of the time, it still doesn't bore and makes for entertaining filming for two hours. Sometimes the acting is weak but most of the time its good.The film contains some rather strong violence in places so I wouldn't recommend this film to people with a nervous disposition. However, if you want a good film that's not at all bad, then Ghost is my choice. Perhaps the ending was not quite believable enough - though I won't give it away here. See the film and judge for yourself. Perhaps some of the film also is too quickly executed - such as Whoopi's rather quick appearance -- though later we do miss Whoopi because the film does drag quite a bit between scenes without Whoopi. Goldwyn makes a good villain as does the actor who plays Willy. It's still a good film, definitely 8 out of 10 from me.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Beyond words, but I'll attempt it","Although often marginalized by my contemporaries, colleagues, and the world of academia at large, the character of Ode May Brown is one of the most riveting, pivotal, and important literary characters of the past two centuries and quite possibly ever.

I would just like to mention that the Spirit World is never that easy to interact with. Yes, there are a few blessed people who seem to be able to connect very well but rarely for a long period of time consistently, but some spirit-people can be just as annoying as Sam became to get help!The music is perfect and helps create the feeling of loss and grief we all experience after a loved one has passed over.Sam is correct in saying the 'the love goes with you'.

A Film That Has Stuck With Me,"Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) and Molly Jenson (Demi Moore) are a young couple living in a studio apartment in the city.  But when Sam is accidentally shot while defending Molly from some thug, his desire to stay with her is so strong that his ghost remains on Earth.  He tracks down the man who killed him, but can do nothing to manipulate the world around him.  That is, until he meets Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), a con-artist/seer who can hear him speak.  Sam now must enlist the help of a reluctant Oda Mae to warn Molly that the killer may come back for her as a potential witness against him.This isn't one of the greatest films of all time, but every aspect of the film is somewhat above average.  For 1990, the effects are very good, especially the shadow monsters.  Bruce Joel Rubin writes an excellent and original script that manages to capture female audiences early one with the two people in love and male audiences with the murder mystery/thriller aspect.  Oda Mae is also thrown in for some good comic relief.And I like seeing Demi Moore before she became all plastic and lost that innocence she seemed to have.  The cast is uniformly good, and the cameo from Vincent Schiavelli as the 'Subway Lord' is one of the best parts of the movie.  It may not be for everybody, but you must give it a chance if you've never seen it.",,Anonymous,Romance
Whoopi is the real star!,"This is a fun movie. It's part love story, part tragedy and a whole chunk of comedy to keep it moving at a good pace. I would say this is probably one of Whoopi's finest acting performances - OK it might be lightweight and comedic, but hey, there's nothing wrong with that!!! And it takes a great actress to pull off comedy the way that she does! Plenty of sentimental moments. It's simplistic in its message, but that's not a flaw, it's an accolade.

"In between the fantasy and romance, there's a grim horror film hidden...","""Ghost"" isn't the usual type of movie for me to review, since it's a mainstream classic, and primarily a romantic drama. Yours truly almost exclusively reviews horror, thriller and cult movies; - the more obscure, bloody and shocking, the better! And yet, ever since I saw this film for the first time - I was barely 10 or 11 years old - the one thing that intrigued me the most was how dark, unsettling and violent several crucial parts were! The thin line between fantasy and horror shouldn't come too much as a surprise, since writer Bruce Joel Ruben (who righteously won an Oscar for this great film) previously wrote a couple of solid genre movies already, like ""Brainstorm"", ""Deadly Friend"" and ""Jacob's Ladder"".The story, the performances, the soundtrack and the beauty of ""Ghost"" have been applauded more than enough already, so please allow me to only focus on the dazzling horror highlights for a change. Three notable aspects in this department are: #1 - the pure hatred and violence in Sam Wheat's eyes when he pushes around his foes and basically hunts them into death. #2 - the nifty detail that the spirits of ""bad people"" are taken away by grim and pitch-black shadows when they die. #3 - the great (late) Vincent Schiavelli, as the nameless subway ghost, depicts one of the most petrifying and enigmatic supportive characters of 90s cinema. His naturally menacing looks and charisma, his rage, his unrevealed background story... The subway ghost should have received his very own (horror) film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love that is stronger than death,"I remember the movie ""Ghost"" from my childhood. A bright unusual story that both pleased with an interesting plot and made you laugh heartily thanks to a very successful humor. I remember thinking at that time how it turns out to be possible to competently combine drama and comedy in one project. Oh, there were times.The film tells the story of Sam and Molly, whose ideal relationship tragically ends when Sam becomes the victim of a brutal murder. However, his spirit remains on Earth, and now he is forced to find a way to protect his beloved from impending danger. With the help of the extraordinary medium Ode Mae Brown, whose participation brings a lot of humor to the film, Sam tries to convey the truth to Molly and cope with injustice even from outside this world.At the center of ""Ghosts"" is the story of a genuine feeling - love that knows no boundaries, neither physical nor temporal. The film surprisingly sincerely shows how the eternal feelings that unite people can overcome even death. The story makes us think about what connects us with our loved ones, how important it is to keep what is significant, even if it seems that everything is lost. In addition to the theme of love, it also raises questions about honesty, trust, and even vindictiveness, which play an important role in the story. All this makes ""Ghost"" not just a mystical drama, but a timeless novel about the struggle for justice and real feelings.Whoopi Goldberg's amazing performance as the medium Ode Mae Brown deserves special mention. Her image became not only the heart of the humorous part of the film, but also emotionally enhanced the dramatic moments where her character helps Sam in his mission. Goldberg filled her character with bright charisma and unique energy, for which she deservedly received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Whoopi's acting brought a significant dose of comedy to the film, but it never broke the tragic and romantic atmosphere of the film.""The Ghost"" was not only warmly welcomed by the audience, but also received recognition from film critics. The film was awarded two Academy Awards - I have already mentioned one, and the second statuette went to the picture for the best original screenplay, which emphasizes the skill of directing and the quality of the script. The inclusion of mystical and romantic elements gave the film a unique look that was appreciated. The film was also nominated for an Oscar in the categories ""Best Film"", ""Best Original Soundtrack"" and ""Best Editing"", which once again emphasizes its importance in the film industry and contribution to the genre of romantic drama.""Ghost"" is a powerful and poignant film about love and loss that does not leave anyone indifferent. The magnificent performance of Whoopi Goldberg and the touching story of Sam and Molly performed by Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore make it a real classic, in which there was room for both humor and deep philosophical reflections.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Now do you believe in ghosts?,"Sam Wheat is killed during a botched mugging but his spirit is stuck in spirit world limbo. Watching over his left behind lover, Molly, it becomes clear that there is far more to his killing than it at first seemed. Enlisting the help of kooky psychic Oda Mae Brown, Sam must protect the now in danger Molly whilst simultaneously getting to the bottom of his murder.Ghost is a multi genre offering, not just purely a romantic weepy that its detractors would have you believe. Romance, fantasy, mystery, thriller, comedy and no little bit of spooky shenanigans all fuse together to form Jerry Zucker's monster box office smash of 1990. Made for $22 million, it has gone on to make a staggering $517 million worldwide, proof positive that the public by and large will buy into a simple story as long as it's put together well with the afore mentioned elements. The central theme of true love reaching from beyond the grave to prove itself eternal is something that most folk find endearing in a non sickly kind of way, with it naturally helped by having a cast list firing on all cylinders.Tho Jerry Zucker's (Airplane/Top Secret) direction is uneven, it's to be expected when this is after all his first solo feature, he is however well served by his stars. Patrick Swayze wasn't wanted for the part of Sam Wheat, but he fought tooth and nail for the project and nailed the role with gusto and emotionally driven force. Demi Moore as Molly was never lovelier, trimmed short hair to reveal a gorgeous young face, her feeding off of Swayze's energy provides the film with its credible impetus. Whoopi Goldberg as Oda Mae turns in an Oscar winning performance, wonderfully funny, yet also at times sympathetic without over stretching the essence of the piece, while Tony Goldwyn and Vincent Schiavelli also provide two memorable (for the right reasons) performances. The effects work of course looks amazing for its time, none more so when the dark side of death is fully realised via shadows in the films most creepy moments, whilst the editing (Walter Murch) and screenplay (Oscar winning by Bruce Rubin) is from the top draw.So yes it's safe to say that me, a butch middle aged bloke, is personally a fan of Ghost, there's a little bit of corn in there, especially in one particular dance sequence, but mainly the film is a pure delight. Helped by Maurice Jarre's hauntingly sweet score and boosted by the use of the magnificent Unchained Melody by The Righteous Brothers, Ghost is a film to revel in if you are prepared to let it get deep inside of you. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

So what was it about this lighter weight film, which could so easily have veered into corny territory, which remains, for me, a contemporary classic love story? - I'm not sure - it could be the sincere performances, it could be the sound track but I think it is probably the way it explores that area of love that goes beyond the boundaries of mortal souls, beyond the realms of this world, a bond which transcends that fragile hold we have on life to an unknown world of everlasting love.",,Anonymous,Romance
Ghost,"Here's a good review for the 1990 movie Ghost:""Ghost is a timeless romantic thriller that has aged remarkably well. Patrick Sweeney's (Patrick Swayze) murder sparks a chilling and emotional journey that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.Demí Moore shines as Molly, conveying a convincing portrayal of grief and determination. Whoopi Goldberg adds a touch of warmth and humor as psychic medium Oda Mae Brown, in a role that earned her an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.The film's blend of romance, drama, and suspense, combined with its memorable performances and iconic scenes (who can forget the pottery wheel?), makes Ghost a must-watch for anyone who loves a good love story.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

It was surprisingly great!,"I'm pretty sure most people throughout history asked themselves about the afterlife. Some believe in concepts of heaven and hell, others believe in reincarnation (a person being reborn as someone else), and some believe in ghosts. The movie tries to explore the idea of what will happen if someone dies by an unfortunate event like murder. And this is what happens with Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze). Two citizens of Manhattan Sam and Molly Jensen (Demi Moore) decide to go the theatre to see a musical on stage. Unfortunately, going back from it, a criminal named Willy Lopez (Rick Aviles) kills Sam, because he gave no money. When he first discovered the fact that he's a ghost, Sam was very confused, but now he has a goal to warn his girlfriend about the killer's and one of colleague's plans to taking her life away. Luckilly, Wheat meets Oda Mae (Whoopi Goldberg), a charlatan that pretends to communicate with ghosts, soon after realising that she can actually do that after seeing Sam, she has to do everything he says, by pretending to be someone else and convincing Molly that she's in danger. Even though it reminds me of a russian movie with a similar name starting Fedor Bondarchuk, it still has lot's of good ideas about afterlife. It has it's own hell and heaven (although not actually shown in the movie, depending on the person's personality, different fates await them) and how some just prefer to stay on Earth like the subway ghost (Vincent Schiavelli), who teaches Sam to control objects using telekinesis, since ghosts are invisible.The cast is great in my opinion. Starting with Sam Wheat, in the beginning he treats Molly like a friend by always calling her Ditto and not taking her seriously. But after his death, he needs to warn her about Willy Lopez to save her. I saw him as some kind of a guardian angel, who is worried about his girlfriend. I could actually feel for him, because he didn't want Molly to suffer the same fate, thus making him sensitive and likeable. Molly isn't exactly the main character, but still an important one. Demi's performance was good in my opinion. Her character at first denied Oda Mae's words about her friend, but as time progresses, she understands that some impossible at first things can actually be real. Oda Mae Brown is a fraud that just wants to receive money for herself and her siblings. Although she's not the most honest character in this film, she tries to help Sam Wheat, even though she's doing that against her will and just wants him to go away. Her performance by Goldberg was great, because she could express emotions like shock, anger and convincing extremely well. The rest are great too, like Carl, Willy Lopez and the subway ghost. Each having their own motive and a huge impact on the story. Despite it's great plot, it's not perfect. There were 2 similar scenes around the end where 2 characters were getting sent to a not so good place, instead of showing typical flames covering them, we see some black human like spirits taking both antagonists away. When I saw these scenes, I was actually scared, because they were pretty creepy, but it does give a great moral that if you don't be a good person in life, something bad may happen to you during and after it.I honestly didn't expect much from this film, but I ended up loving it and it became my new favorite movie along with Limitless, Butterfly effect (that actually starts Moore's ex husband Ashton Kutcher) and Interstate 60. If your a fan of stories about ghosts and mystical events, then this is a must watch for you. Definitely a great experience that I would go through again, but only as a movie and not in real life.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""Who ya gonna call? . . .""","Ghost (1990) -I don't tend to watch this film that regularly because you only need to watch it once to remember what happens. However that might have been one of the good things about it, because it really was accessible and in many ways a pleasure to watch. That doesn't mean that there weren't some serious bits that tugged at the heartstrings or angered, but there were also plenty of jokes and humour to lighten the load of what could have been a heavy storyline without them otherwise.Patrick Swayze, as the title character of the ""Ghost"" Sam, did his usually great job as a romantic interest and played brilliantly opposite Whoopi Goldberg's fantastic comedic relief. Not as the other romantic lead, but in the form of the spirit world connecting, although usually fraudulent, séance conducter Oda Mae Brown, in possibly one of her best roles.I did think that it might also have been the best role of Demi Moore too. I could really see her beauty as Molly in this one and the sadness of her loss and of Sam's losing her too. She managed to stay sweet and appealing and I couldn't help but feel for her as she was hounded by the various characters for good or for bad.I'd probably be pretty gutted too if I had a guy like that and he went and died on me. It would be just my luck to finally find one and for that to happen.I did find it hard not to fancy Carl (Tony Goldwyn) when I saw his fantastic abs right at the beginning of the film and Patrick Swayze looked pretty nice with his glorious chest on display too, although
I didn't like the burgundy blouse that his character, Sam, got stuck in for the rest of the film however.Also, because of this film, I will always be scared of the tube/subway, mostly because of the scary train riding ghost in it played by Vincent Schiavelli.I did feel that the production might have been something of a jinx as I looked through the actors on IMDB and it seemed that so many of them had passed on before their time, especially dear Patrick. Someone should probably make sure that Demi and Whoopi are still okay.Overall, I've always forgotten how much I've liked and enjoyed this story when I did watch it, despite the fact that it was one that didn't have a complicated story or any bits that's I might have missed, because it was just a well made film.I wasn't so keen on the stage musical, but I would find it hard to deny how good the actual concept and delivery of this version was, it's just a clever story and although it was bittersweet, there was so much that was good about it.Nothing stood out as particularly odd to me watching in 2023, so I would say that it was fairly timeless too and it certainly had a magic about it.868.91/1000.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

A bit of everything,Maybe Ghost's enduring appeal is down to the fact that there are elements in it for everyone. There is enough romance in it for women and just about enough humour and storyline for the guys to enjoy as well. On some levels this film also works well as a murder mystery as well.It looks a little dated in places and I have no doubt that in a few years time some bright spark producer will try to do a remake of it.The leads are all good in their roles and the film is enjoyable enough if you look past a few of the plot holes.I think this film will continue to make people laugh and cry for many years to come and the newly opened musical will only help this.,4.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Matter of Love and Death ...,"No matter how prepared we get for corniness, we rapidly find ourselves absorbed by the romance between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze and much more by the depiction of death strangely plausible and, no pun intended, quite haunting.Indeed, the main premise of ""Ghost"", which won the Best Original Screenplay Oscar, is to feature death from the dead's perspective. Not a revolutionary plot device but the only one that occupies the whole story with the ghost trying to reach the living. Why wouldn't Sam try to talk to his parents, his friends, why would Molly, all of sudden, become the center of his afterlife? The script tactfully escapes from this criticism when it's clearly established that Sam's death is not accidental, and the cause of his murder incidentally puts Molly in a dangerous situation.I also want to answer one criticism expressed by Roger Ebert, why would a ghost still care about Earthly matters, why wouldn't follow the white light and go have a chat with either ""Elvis of Aristotles""? I think that the most important feeling channeled by Swayze's performance is disbelief. He can't get the idea of not belonging to this world anymore, and this is why I felt that the portrayal of death, as a separation between the soul and the body, and the atrocious witnessing of one's death, was 'plausible', I could imagine myself dying this way. It's even ironic how Sam goes through the stages of grief for his own death, from denial to resignation.And it's extraordinary how Swayze perfectly captures the desperateness of a man who had so much to do, so many dreams and projects and finally saw his life abruptly cut. His penetrating expressions are astonishingly convincing, whether it's for sadness, empathy, compassion, his eyes are more eloquent than any of his lines. And his performance is crucial since he's portraying an isolated character. As soon as he becomes a ghost, he only interacts with a few other ghosts, even Whoopi Goldberg who plays the medium Oda Mae, can only hear him. Swayze's believability relies on his ability to touch the viewers instead of the characters, definitely the most defining performance of an actor who sadly left us too soon.And Sam's exhaustive journey, starts with his necessity to deal with his new condition, in order to stop the scheme that lead to his death. And the learning part renovates all the good old archetypes of the ghost crossing doors and touching objects. Ghosts can feel sensations and only touch or move things if they're able to think themselves as ghosts, it's an exciting part of the film to see a man learning his powers to be able to use them as weapons. In conclusion, Sam stays because he can't believe he dies and he tries to reach Molly because she's in danger. We're far from the whole 'unfinished job' and 'transcending love' clichés, the film delivers something original out of familiar material.The film also innovates with the scary portrayal of the bad guys' deaths. The atrocious sight of moaning evil shadows converging to take someone away justifies the belief in a sort of immanent justice, and the exhilarating idea that we all die twice, the good people going to heaven, and the others in some place, we don't want to know. The villains' demises is very unsettling, it can even traumatize some sensitive minds, and you see in Swayze's eyes that he feels sorry for them, for even death don't make people even. But ""Ghost""'s thrilling metaphysical value also originates the magnificent ending which is probably the closest depiction to heaven ever gracing the screen.And there's another cliché that the film tactfully reinvents, the 'Old Magic Negro', and it succeeds for two reasons. First, Oda Mae is a crook, she's not a real medium, which is funny and she discovers that she really has the power, which is even funnier. Secondly, it's Whoopi Goldberg and it's one of her greatest roles, earning her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, and beyond the comic relief aspect, this is exactly what a supporting performance is supposed to be: secondary, yet so scene-stealing that we can't imagine the film without it. Goldberg provides all the laughs, capable of the most acid irony with Swayze, and being comprehensive and diplomatic, in her streetwise way, with Molly.This is a credit to Jerry Zucker, who didn't forget his comedic roots and made a few hilarious moments of the film. My only regret and this time, I share Ebert's view, I wish he had the guts to portray the second kissing scene with Whoopi Goldberg. No matter how weird it would have looked, it would have touched a very sensitive nerve and be even sadder because we would still get the idea that the sweet and tender Molly can't see Sam since he entered Oda Mae's body and it would have made the final scene even more rewarding. And I can't go on without mentioning the sweet and sensitive performance of Demi Moore as the fragile Molly, unbelievably cute with that short haircut, that became one of the film's trademarks along with Swayze's red shirt and Oda Mae's exaggerated dress.Even though Jerry Zucker, the co-director of so many spoof classics, can seem as unlikely choice to direct a drama like ""Ghost"" but with all the material he had, the script, the casting, the visual effects, a magnificent score from Maurice Jarre, all he had to do is to assemble all these elements of greatness in a straight-forward way, without overdoing anything. And the film had the cinematic quality of successful movies; this capability to be memorable in a genuine and creative way, the unavoidable iconic pottery scene with ""Unchained Melody"" probably earned the film its ticket for immortality.Not to mention the powerful ending, which, after the death of Patrick Swayze, had the bittersweet feeling of a sad premonition.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The perfect supernatural love story.,"Jerry Zucker, who together with his brother David are known for their spoof movies, directs one of the most popular and highly-acclaimed love stories ever: Ghost. Here, yuppie couple Sam (Patrick Swayze) and Molly (Demi Moore) are in love and happy together. On their way back to their apartment after a night at the theater, they encounter a thief and, during the botched robbery, Sam is murdered. While Molly is left grieving for Sam's death, their undying love keeps Sam's spirit on earth and he is determined to get to the bottom of his murder, which he finds out was no accident. With the help of psychic Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), Sam must warn Molly of the impending danger.This is one of those movies I would watch over and over again and it is still fresh every time I watch it. It's full of suspense from start to finish as Sam tries desperately to communicate with Molly from the dead, and as he tries to prevent the bad guys from harming her. Sam and Molly's love for each other give this film a dose of romance and features one of the most memorable scenes in cinema history: their love scene while the Righteous Brothers' ""Unchained Melody"" is played in the background. Oda Mae Brown delivered this movie's much-needed comic relief, giving us a dose of her acid wit humor. And, add in the drama of Sam's mission, this is a multi-genre film that will endear an audience for years to come.Swayze, Moore and Goldberg all did a great job in their performances, with an exciting story and plot by writer Bruce Joel Rubin and solid direction by Jerry Zucker.

Some thoughts for an actual review,"Amazing film!Best description for it would be: a blend between Sixth Sense and Heaven Can Wait.You can tell that the comedy is uniquely Jerry Zucker. Really added to the film and made it even more enjoyable.I expected romance but I felt it was a little overboard in this movieI could spend all day thinking about the logistics of being a ghost in the real world, such as, how can the main character sit down (or even stand up) when he can't touch or kick anything and can walk thru walls? However, if you put that aside, this is a really fun and exciting flick, and all things considered, does a really good job explaining how a ghost would exist if they did really exist.This is a mess of a review cause it's just notes for a future review but thanks for reading anyways!P.

Truly a classic from the 1990s that stands the test of time,"I have seen this movie for the first time at 14 and I liked it very much then. Now, 7 years later, I catched this movie on TV one evening during last summer and I still liked it like the very first time. And it truly deserves its cult status. Now I can go to the review.Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is a bank clerk working in New York City that begins to share a loft with his girlfriend Molly Jensen (Demi Moore). After one evening at the theater Sam and Molly are harassed by a mugger who stabs Wheat on the chest and he suddenly returns on Earth in the form of a ghost. Now as a ghost he has a mission: to take care of his girlfriend and find out who killed him. He suddenly meets a sensitive named Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg) that is the only one who can talk to him and reluctantly accepts to help him. Sam soon discovers the truth: his best friend and business partner Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn) made secret deals with Willy Lopez (the mugger) and secretly ordered him to kill Sam for stealing the notebook with all the passwords of the bank accounts. So now it's up to Sam and Oda Mae to stop Carl and Willy and save Molly. I won't spoil the rest since many reviewed this movie already.So, why this movie holds up well? Most obviously the acting: it's great by everyone. Patrick Swayze is very credible as the lead and you will always root for him. Demi Moore gives a very heartfelt performance and it's probably one of her best, Tony Goldwyn is very good as the villain who of course ends the way he deserves and Whoopi Goldberg shines as the sensitive. She is probably my favourite character in the movie, and mostly because her lines were at times hysterical. And this movie gives also a nice message: don't kill people for money or fame, because it will end very badly for you if you do it.However, a true classic from the 1990s that even if you watch it after some years like I did, you will still like it, like the very first time.

Heavily overrated but deserves a watch!,"""Ghost"" is a beautiful romance story from beyond the grave. The main problem with this movie is that it's highly overrated and it has every possible clichè from Hollywood. First; it's lead characters are Hollywood superstars with a bad reputation although they deliver a great performance. Then, the movie had a HUGE promotional campaign. Everybody knew about ""Ghost"" when it came out and to these days, it's one of the most spoofed and parodied movies ever made (the sex scene is always spoofed!).Anyways, ""Ghost"" is a really well done movie. It has romance, suspense, comedy drama, and even little horror elements such as minimal gore. The acting is really good. Whoopi Goldberg steals the show mixing drama and comedy. The woman is amazing. Demi Moore is extremely cute and delivers a tender, sexy performance. Patrick S. also impressed me with his solid dramatic and comical performance.The direction is also top class, and the score is perfect! There you go.

You will believe (that it's a timeless classic),"I first watched 'Ghost' back when it was released in 1990. I was a typical teen in those days, only really interested in films involving Austrian musclemen beating villains to a pulp. Yet there was something about a supernatural, romantic comedy that just shouldn't have appealed to me - but it did. And I'm as pleased to say that 'Ghost' is still as perfect today as it ever was.I'm pretty sure most people know the plot by now, but, on the off-chance you've never seen it (or figured out the basic premise via the title!), it involves one of the central characters dying before their time and therefore carrying on existing in spectral form in order to take care of business before they can cross over to the other side.The main stars all perform some iconic roles here - don't think that it's just Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore all the way (who are both brilliant), but - as the Oscars showed - it's Whoopie Goldberg who steals every scene she's in as the larger-than-life psychic/con-woman who finds she has a sudden knack at speaking to those on 'the other side.'Don't go thinking that this is just a 'rom-com.' Yes, the 'love aspect' is an integral part of the story, but it has an appeal that's far broader than your average Jennifer Anniston flick. Hopefully, anyone of any age and gender should appreciate this. It even gets a little creepy towards the end with two instances that have brought a shiver down my spine every time I watch it.I can't really stress just how perfect 'Ghost' is. There's so little to say that's negative about it (unless you count my Mum's comment about how Demi Moore just spends the whole movie crying!). Perhaps there are some 'green screen' effects that are more noticeable today than when they were first released, but that's about the only vaguely-negative thing I can think of saying. You really should have watched 'Ghost' at least once in your life. It really is a timeless tale that hasn't aged a bit in its thirty year lifespan. Should I say it will probably live forever?",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Hilarity ensues when he recruits the worst actress ever, Whoopi Goldberg, to act as a medium between ghost and human world.One evening in January 2006, I had nothing better to do than watch ""Ghost"" on the ABC Family network with my sister. And I freely admit it sucked me in. This was my first time seeing the film since being considerably younger, though I recalled most of the plot. I re-watched the film yet again in October 2007 and August 2010.The real fun of the film begins when Swayze learns to touch the human world thanks to Vincent Schiavelli (a character actor who coincidentally died a week before my January 2006 viewing). Not unlike ""Ghost Dad"", the challenge is to make things happen in the world of the living while you remain dead. And unlike ""Beetlejuice"", you cannot come back by having someone say your name three times.The special effects in this film I always thought were pretty good by 1990 standards. The walking through walls looks fine, and the ""hell spirits"" (for lack of a better term) really scared me when I was younger (and even now are somewhat creepy). Sure, the microscope vision when he walks through doors and such is cheesy and was completely unnecessary, but it answers a question some viewers may have had about what ghosts see.I've heard physics people complain that Sam can go through walls and doors and other objects, yet is able to stand on the floor just fine, or even go up stairs. That is a really valid point... but let's just admit it: the plot would be less interesting if they had to deal with such limitations, or brought Sam back as a mere spirit with no shape.Quicker than you can say ""turn me on, dead man"" this film will work its way into your heart with a simple, romantic (yet somewhat action-packed) plot and classic song (""Unchained Melody""). You've probably already seen this movie a dozen times, but if not (if you're like my sister) you should see it soon.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ditto,"Perhaps it is worth a mention prior to anything more serious that unfolds with Ghost, however the very opening sequence is both eerie and initially hard to define.The quick movement to a sort of pedestrian interplay removes the stark and if you will undefinable aspect of the very opening with the braking down some old wall and as viewers we are then provided with the story that as suggested as pedestrian.If I recall even the music attached to the scene however short its appearance equaled a position that was more interesting than its duration allowed for,however it did not seem to have been meant to provide much more than that.Ghost,like so many movies,provides the viewer with what appears but does not allow for what is.The question when any pretense requires our cooperation is if in fact what we are being asked is either worthy or in fact believable?Is what we are being asked by our watching this picture worthy of a more serious consideration?The story is not so easy to unravel as the supra natural plays a part in the drama and even allows for our lead male to provide an unflinching dare as to the eternity that awaits.It is without question a brave and desirable emotion that makes for the truth and that is what is believed in.The lead is worthy but some of the other aspects are not.Sam Wheat is a genuine good guy and though we do not perceive this initially he is very intelligent and even accomplished as his position with the bank symbolizes.The counter to Sam Wheat is not so easy to pigeon hole as both Molly Jensen and Carl Bruner are very much on the same side as both seek to deny the existence of perhaps a soul but just as important to deny Sam Wheat a life.This though is not customary in the consideration of Molly but there is nothing in her characterization that would suggest to me that they not only knew each other but truly loved each other as well.I felt we were not looking at the real thing but the mere suggestion which is as it is a mere suggestion.It is a critical perception to understand that there is cause as to why nothing that can be suggested is believed in either.The Law as to these events is so uncaring and unbelieving that they sought out the truth to kill more so than to be convinced otherwise that there is a truth of any sort to be gained.The only truth the law recognizes is the law and the law needs to get its way.What does that mean?It means that there are many weaknesses to this pictures underpinning and the presence or for that matter the place that law enforcement should represent is terribly lacking and without a face,it is without a heart.There is such compelling evidence that any real detective work would of uncovered Carl Bruner and Willy Lopez and perhaps required both Federal as well as International Law concerns with the revealing of the person on the other end of the phone.But this picture seems to have drawn a conclusion about something else and it is something else that it wants to showcase.Molly like Carl does much to deny the existence of the heart and soul of the picture by not allowing for some far fetched idea about the supra natural but it seems is won over by perhaps the pictures lead Female in Oda Mae Brown.The character of Oda Mae Brown has the ability to communicate with the dead and it is the place that Sam Wheat finds a kindred soul and a receiver if you will for his cries from the world beyond that allow this picture some leeway.Indeed both Sam Wheat and Oda Mae Brown are critical to love and justice even unto the end of time.Both of these performances are very good and should provide real entertainment.Molly is not as suggested a full bodied presence though indeed the appearances suggest otherwise but that is neither here nor there as Molly does not believe and as such has a more difficult time determining just how that kind of information became the property of some foreign body in this character Oda Mae Brown.She eventually seems to have been won over but not before the very soul of the picture rises having been provided with the truth so that the heart and life being required now leaves this world behind and is allowed to rest in peace.The end of the picture is very good,it is if you will a truly emotional parting and an ascension that is believed in.A degree of success is achieved through this if you will miracle however it is very lovely and very charming and well worth the viewing pleasure of the audience.The darkness that awaits all who heed not to repent will befall them as they did to the Willy Lopez and Carl Bruner character.There deaths in the picture occur with a chilling fearful acknowledgment of the designs of the darkness and the results that it provides for.It is a true admission when Carl gets it in the end and like a moment in time does not believe that the end of time has come for this particular criminal.This is where the picture does provide some interest and it is in its attempt to a moral underpinning that allow for the furtherance of the supra natural conceit showcased through out the picture.Why conceit?Because that is where the answers are not here in this world but in the supra natural and though it is the supra natural,the underpinning is of a world that we do not possess the natural ability to know which only through some sort of miracle we will ever have just that kind of ability.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best love movies,"Very good love comedy/drama with mainstream formula but very effective performances and production which tells a good story quite well.The special effects are also top notch and the attention to detail was taken at heart.May not be appreciated by non-spiritualists though for it's uncompromising theoloogical depictions and statements.This movie is so spiritually moving,it will bring tears to most BELIEVERS just as effectively as the closing moments did in the masterpiece ""It's A Wonderfull Life"".What keeps this movie from being a masterpiece like the above mentioned movie is the average cinematography,editing and script.Also,the lack of premium acting from Moore which is only adequate.Great performance from Swayze and Goldberg!For love story fans who are spiritualists and for big fans of the lead actors......",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Now do ya believe in Ghosts?,"I first saw this film when I was about 11 and loved every single aspect of it. To me, it was just what a film should be - heartbreaking, funny, spooky and thought provoking. Patrick Swayzee lead a great cast into what was about the best film of 1990, with the oh-so-memorable 'clay scene' it couldn't fail to be a very, very good film. Swayzee play Sam Wheat a very much in love man, who's life is tragically cut short by his nasty friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn). Too scared to 'step into the light' Sam stays on earth and soon befriends crooked Oda Mae (Whoopie Goldburg) who suddenly finds out her talents for talking to the dead are actually for real. Sam spends much of the film trying to contact distraught girlfriend Molly, who he's left behind and believe me, the ending calls for a very big box of Kleenex!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Well-Researched!,"The writers for this film obviously thoroughly researched what is known about ghosts.  I understand that they checked with Tibetan Buddhist monks on what someone is likely to encounter in the ""bardo state,"" after death.  Over many centuries, Tibetan Buddhism has compiled countless data about this.A more recent film which shows similar depth of research is ""The Sixth Sense"" (1990).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The rules of the game..,"The film really plays up the sappiness of lovers but for romantic die-hards like myself, this is THE movie to rejoice in.

It may not be for everyone's taste.. but mainly for lovelorns who appreciate a wonderful tale of love lost and found.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A love story with a lot of heart and Whoopi Goldberg.,"The problem with romance movies is trying to make the love between the two main characters look believable to the point where you really think that their love would transcend death. Ghost's problem? Making Swyaze's Sam believable as a ghost who would risk his afterlife to protect Demi Moore's Molly. And I was somewhat sold primarily because of Swayze's performance. As Sam, Swayze looks like a man who has literally lost everything except for this love he has for Molly. Moore's performance was kind of lackluster to me, there were times where I was just kind of put off by her.However, when Sam and Molly are together and are just looking into each other eyes, I completely believe them. The chemistry between them is sexy. The dance scene when Sam possesses Oda Mae Brown's (Whoopi Goldberg) body is just electric. Or the scene where they're fooling around with the pottery wheel is incredibly sexy.Overall, the acting is believably good. It's really not that shocking to learn that Whoopi Goldberg won an Oscar for Best Actress in a Supporting Role as Oda Mae. (Ghost also won for Best Writing, Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Music Original Song, and Best Film Editing.) Unlike other romantic movies, the plot doesn't disappear behind the love story. The twist with Sam's death, the story with his best friend Carl (Tony Goldwyn) made the movie even more enjoyable to watch. When movies are bogged down with the love story, it takes me out of the movie, and Ghost did not suffer that problem.Ghost has an interesting plot with a variety of characters, strong acting with cheesy 90s special effects makes it one of my romantic movie favorites.I love movies that can make me cry simply because of the love story and this one definitely hit the mark. For all those girls who watch those Nicholas Sparks movies need to watch a real 'romance' movie that's good. Ghost is one of the best.Highly recommended. 8 out of 10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Things to do in movies, when you're dead","Yes I used a title of a different movie (different genre even) as a summary line here. While I like that movie, I'm not even sure if it is that well known to be understood. But that is besides the point - thinking too much in general would be besides the point. Yes this is heavily flawed if you think about it (with the usual cliches and tropes, how can ghosts ""walk"" and more cliches like that) - so just don't. Either don't watch the movie if you think it's too cliche, too romantic (which it sort of is) or don't overthink it! Just enjoy the ride.Having said that, Patrick Swayze has to be so patient - of course his character is not able to accept ""reality"", but he as an actor not being actually able to interact with others for most of the movie ... tough, very tough. But also Kudos to Whoopi who made the movie what it is with her humor and what she brought to the character. Overall a very straightforward story, I'd argue no surprises (even if there are ""twists""), but more than decently told.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Emotional And Brilliantly Acted,","Ghost is a fantastic movie with a brilliant story line,a fantastic cast and great characters.The movie is very emotional from the moment Sam dies and I will admit,I usually don't cry watching a movie,but the end of this left me in tears,I wont tell you what happened,but if you have any heart,you will be upset.Whoopi Goldbergs performance in this movie is amazing and she definitely deserved her Academy Award for Best Actress In A Supporting Role,I believed her performance all the way through,she did seem genuinely creeped out that she could hear ghosts.Sam Wheat (Patrick Swayze) is killed by a man who is now looking to kill his girlfriend Molly (Demi Moore).Its up to Sam to protect Molly,but he is only a ghost,so he gets help from Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg),a woman who can hear ghosts.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Honest Review,"Tony Goldwyn should have been a more popular actor. He was actually pretty exceptional in almost everything he has done but never actually made it to superstar status.Instead he kind of lingered in supporting actor limbo through the 90s and then kind of disappeared.It's a shame.And he's not the only unsung hero in Ghost, Vincent Schiavelli is in it too.It has a great cast that brings their all to the film.The script isn't that imaginative, you've seen a few movies like this before, but that never really matters when it's done well.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Still enjoyable after 30 years!!,"Thought I will give myself a treat and watch ""Ghost"" since I have not seen it for ages. It is still such a watchable film due to the main characters and tight story line. Whoopi is outstanding in this role. Wished that she will play another role like this again soon! Miss her in films -boring watching her do talk shows. Patrick Swayze - such a talented actor that lived a short life. Demi was absolutely angelic in this movie - her natural beauty shines through and through. And the music - I loved the old record player with the display of records and decking one record on the player and then it goes back into the slot and come down the next record. Where can I get this vintage record player?:-)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A touching and entertaining movie on all levels,"Having lost a lot of friends and relatives, I don't typically enjoy a movie with death as a major theme but this one is really different. It's an interesting and entertaining story from the start to the finish with believable and enjoyable characters. Demi Moore plays one of her best roles and Whoopi Goldberg steals the show as a seance who didn't realize her own ability. She won an Oscar for this role. Patrick Swayze plays Sam - who discovers that things are not all over at death.The bad guys in this one are some real nasty and believable villains too.This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy. It's a wonderful love story, it has twists and turns, some humor and a good share of pathos. If you have somehow missed this one, add it to your 'must see' list.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazingly Underrated Classic,"The movie ""Ghost"", when it came out, was extremely popular, and for good reason. The story was far from what could have been a very cliché plot. I like to think of it as ""A Christmas Carol"" meets John Grisham novel. The romance in the movie was well played and very touching. Even though this movie may have some spiritual content that Christian's may not agree with, it does express the relationship between good and evil in and out of this world and touches upon spiritual warfare with demons and angels. Heaven and hell are both shown in detail, but it makes it look like if you do good things you go to heaven, and vice versa. I believe that this is not the case in my faith, that all you have to do is accept Jesus into your heart; but even so people of all religions should enjoy this movie. The suspense and action did not disappoint. The real star of this movie was Whoopi Goldberg, who stole every one of her scenes with her bold and loud presence, personality, and humor; she well deserved her Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress as Oda Mae Brown. She wasn't the only actor who did exceptionally well though; Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Tony Goldwyn made a fantastic ensemble. Swayze and Moore had beautiful chemistry together with the memorable pottery scene. The whole movie works as a whole and it great entertainment, one of my favorites. **8/10**",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
My paranormal love,"I love this movie,the late Patrick Swayze made a very sexy ghost.It is very hard to watch this movie with out crying. Now that he has passed away it is even harder to watch.This is one of the best love stories I have seen.Demi Moore was very good in this movie. The two of them worked very well together,they made me think that;they were really in love.Woopi was very funny in this movie,she made me believe that she could hear ghosts.Tony,did a good job playing both sides of the coin. That is my mom's take on this classic romantic movie. I too love this movie, it made me laugh , cry and feel angry. All true signs of a really good movie! It was sad before but now I can't watch without breaking into tears. From beginning to end, but beside the tragedy .

Possibly the Best Supernatural Love Story Ever Filmed,"What makes this film work is as much about the premise as it is about the acting and the music. The leads, Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg turn what could have been a B-grade forgotten film into a very touching experience. ""Ghost"" is one of a few handful of films which is actually a hybrid of other genres, in this case the love story and the supernatural ghost story, successfully combined. Few hybrid-genre films have been as successful while most fall flat probably because of the difficulty of one genre overshadowing the other. One successful example which comes to mind is the original Ghost Busters, which combined comedy a la Saturday Night Live and supernatural horror.Patrick Swayze, in possibly his best performance, plays Sam Wheat, a bank executive who has as his lover Molly Jensen, a kind and completely loyal woman who creates pottery. One of the most famous scenes prior to Wheat leaving the world of the living is when they both forge pottery together. Unbeknownst to either of them, some bank executives at Wheat's firm are embezzling funds, which they hide into an account held by a fictitious person. Wheat finds out about the discrepancies but becomes the target of a hit, successfully carried out, which kills Sam Wheat the living person and turns him into a ghost. Before leaving for the afterlife, Wheat decides to investigate further into the circumstances which killed him, and solicits the help of a crack-pot con artist-turned psychic, Oda Mae Brown, in an academy-award winning performance by Whoopi Goldberg. A strange threesome develops the Ghost, Brown and Jensen to investigate the scandalous behavior of Carl Bruner (Tony Goldwyn), former colleague and supposed-friend to the late Sam Wheat.In one of the most moving of scenes, the Ghost of Sam Wheat lets his presence known to the lover he left in the world of the living, Molly, played with absolute believability by Demi Moore in possibly her best performance. Demi Moore's emotions and tears are what make this film work. When she realizes the ghost of Sam is in her presence, we as the audience are taken by her emotions. We suspend our disbelief and are captured by Moore's performance. She believes she has been touched by the ghost which makes us believe that we are also in the midst of a supernatural presence. Strangely, I have seen few scenes in films as moving as this one. Only certain scenes from Casablanca rival it.Now certainly, I wouldn't rank this as one of the greatest films ever made, but it is a surprisingly strong offering, and one of the most moving supernatural stories I have ever seen. Horror movies are not typically designed to elicit tears in the audience, but this one does. The three leads are perfectly cast and make us care about the experience. One of the reasons I think Ghost succeeds is that it hits on the true emotions we feel in regards to the loss of a loved one. While ghost stories are usually designed to invoke feelings of dread and fear, we sometimes forget that the emotions are about love and loss in the real world when someone close to us ""passes on"". ""Ghost"" reminds us that we often want to hear from loved ones who are no longer a part of the world of the living.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful,"This is one of my favourite films, I just bought my own copy of it! The love between Sam and Molly is described extremely good, so pure and deep. And they managed to show a strong and passionate lovescene; without making it into pornography. (That's well done in film I think.) Patrick Swayze plays uncredible good at the last scene where he and Molly meet again, and he cries while he is dancing with her (in Oda Maye's body.) I love the music: ""Unchained melody"" is beautiful. As the movie.",,Anonymous,Romance
Blunt Film,"Ghost has an interesting premise and good use of suspense. Whoopi Goldberg's character stuck out too much and the movie's comedy aspect probably didn't mix in with its romantic aspect. Nevertheless the romance was done well and the theme music was nice. Ghost's Christian spiritualism may partly explain its box-office success. Character seemed to be a product of plot, and not the other way around. Hence many of the characters are stereotypical. Skin color seems to correlate with wealth and intelligence. At times the romance lacked subtlety, but romance is hard to pull off without reverting to clichés.7/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"An all-round interesting movie, but a bit too long!","I just watched this movie this morning, though it's bit old, but it's the first time I watched it. As the name says Ghost, its not more of a horror-flick, but a movie that has everything in it, yes the drama, thrill, crime, comedy, romance, scifi!! It's for every other movie fan, but unfortunately there's no horror in it! Yes but there's a ghost(Sam), he is murdered by a man, while being with his girlfriend outside some theater, however that girl ( Demi) thinks that he was somewhat accidentally killed, but actually he was murdered by their trusted good pal named Carl in this movie. Sam stays in this world as a ghost and he has to tell his girl that he was killed and the killer is gonna kill her too! There's much more then that, little bit of comedy shared with the spiritual contractor lady, some sci-fi and some interesting thoughts put into this movie. There are some touchy scenes, they might make you feel the movie! In the end, a must watch , I'm not going to tell you all, so you can watch this. Overall, i'd give this movie 7.5/10! The best actor for this movie has to be Sam.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Rare Multi-Genre Triumph,"What I love most about this film is how it cuts across so many genre lines and still succeeds, mostly due to the original concept of writer Bruce Joel Rubin, the superb direction Zucker, the comic talent of Whoopi Goldberg, and a wonderful, classic song entitled ""Unchained Melody"", written by Alex North and Hy Zaret. Although the Righteous Brothers' version of 1965 is the most famous, the song first found success way back in 1955 when I was only six years old, and I still love it. Unlike other reviewers, I believe that it is a song that has truly weathered the test of time, and very different time it is indeed, only to be resurrected in this very popular film, which in some ways serves as a tribute to it.The film is a thriller, a horror movie, a comedy, and a love story all rolled up into one. While I am not a love story aficionado in any sense, this one worked for me only because of its other aspects. It makes great use of its New York City locale, especially the New York subway system unlike any film since the original ""Taking of Pelham One, Two, Three"".I wasn't keen on Demi Moore's adolescent boy look at all and found that it significantly disrupted the critical, emotional impact of Sam's and Molly's relationship. As to Whoopi, I never could understand why she abandoned her unique art by hosting a silly talk show called ""The View"" in which she has repeatedly expressed opinions on very serious subjects of which she is no expert and is forced to apologize for them on far too many occasions. Whoopi should have stuck to comedy performances rather than attempting to delve into the most complex issues of our time, subjects which she has absolutely no depth of knowledge. Why would she? I'm sure it was a very lucrative move for her but a very sad one all the same as it drastically cheapened her professional standing.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ghost (1990): A Love That Defies Death,"Ghost is a good movie to watch hence it is a film that seamlessly blends romance, supernatural elements, and a touch of comedy, creating a unique cinematic experience that remains memorable even decades later. Starring Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore, and Whoopi Goldberg, the film explores themes of love, loss, and the unresolved issues that can linger beyond death. It is both a captivating love story and a thought-provoking exploration of the afterlife.The plot centers around Sam Wheat (Swayze), a successful banker who, after being tragically murdered, finds himself stuck in the spirit world. He soon discovers that his girlfriend, Molly Jensen (Moore), is in danger and unable to see him. Determined to protect her, Sam seeks the help of a dubious psychic, Oda Mae Brown (Goldberg), who initially does not believe in her own abilities. The dynamic between these three characters is one of the film's strongest points. Swayze delivers a heartfelt performance as a man caught between the world of the living and the dead, while Moore portrays Molly's grief with grace and depth. Goldberg, in her Oscar-winning role, provides much-needed comic relief and emotional resonance as she learns to navigate her newfound abilities.One of the most striking aspects of ""Ghost"" is its exploration of love transcending the boundaries of life and death. The film's emotional core lies in the relationship between Sam and Molly. Their love story is depicted with tenderness, making the viewer truly invest in their connection. The famous pottery scene, where Sam helps Molly mold clay while behind her, has become an iconic moment in cinematic history, symbolizing the intimacy and passion they share, even in the face of tragedy.The screenplay, written by Bruce Joel Rubin, is clever and engaging, effectively balancing moments of humor with poignant reflections on mortality. Rubin's ability to weave together elements of suspense and romance creates a narrative that keeps the audience engaged from start to finish. The film also raises interesting questions about the afterlife and the importance of closure, making viewers reflect on their own relationships and the legacies they leave behind.Visually, ""Ghost"" is a testament to the creativity of its time. The special effects, particularly the ethereal sequences where Sam attempts to communicate with Molly, are innovative and effective, even if they may seem slightly dated by today's standards. The use of light and shadow to depict the spirit world adds to the film's atmospheric quality, enhancing the emotional weight of Sam's journey.The film's score, composed by Maurice Jarre, plays an integral role in establishing the film's mood. The haunting melody complements the emotional highs and lows, drawing viewers deeper into the narrative. The music, like the film itself, is a blend of melancholy and hope, reflecting the complexities of love and loss.However, ""Ghost"" is not without its criticisms. Some viewers may find the pacing uneven, particularly in the second act when the focus shifts to Oda Mae and her interactions with Sam. While these moments provide comic relief, they can occasionally detract from the gravity of Sam's predicament. Additionally, some plot points may seem contrived, particularly in how easily Sam manages to manipulate the physical world despite being a ghost.Despite these minor flaws, ""Ghost"" has endured as a classic for a reason. Its ability to tackle profound themes within an entertaining framework makes it accessible to a wide audience. The film's blend of romance, comedy, and supernatural elements ensures that it resonates with viewers on multiple levels.In conclusion, ""Ghost"" remains a poignant exploration of love that transcends life and death. With strong performances from Swayze, Moore, and Goldberg, a clever script, and memorable visuals, it captures the essence of human connection and the unresolved issues that can linger long after a loved one has passed. Its iconic moments, particularly the pottery scene and Oda Mae's comedic antics, have solidified its place in cinematic history. Whether you're watching it for the first time or revisiting it years later, ""Ghost"" continues to evoke laughter, tears, and contemplation about the power of love and the importance of saying goodbye.Don't miss out people....",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A classic,"I just watched *Ghost* (1990), and wow, what a movie! It's such a perfect blend of romance, suspense, and the supernatural. The story follows Sam (Patrick Swayze) and Molly (Demi Moore), this deeply in-love couple whose world is turned upside down when Sam is suddenly killed. But instead of moving on, he stays as a ghost to protect Molly from danger-with the hilarious help of Oda Mae Brown, played by Whoopi Goldberg. Honestly, Whoopi stole the show for me-she brought so much humor and heart to the movie.I have to mention that iconic pottery scene with ""Unchained Melody"" playing-it's such a classic moment that hits all the right emotional notes. And beyond just the romance, there's a real thrill to the whole plot, especially with Sam trying to figure out who's behind his death.It's one of those movies that makes you feel a lot-love, loss, hope-and by the end, you're just left thinking about how powerful love really is. I get why it's considered a classic. Definitely worth watching if you haven't already!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best love story,"After 12 years Ghost would have to be the best love story in recent years.

One night Sam is mugged and killed and is trying to contact Molly beyond the grave as the murderer is in her life. With the help of Oda Mae Brown, brilliantly played by Whoopi Goldberg he contacts Molly through Oda and of course Molly doesn't believe her.I won't spoil the outcomes for the people who haven't seen this but there are a few twists and turns although one was very obvious and was picked up the first time I saw this as a 13 year old girl.This is the only film which makes me cry every time I watch it.

It entertained and shocked me while evoking my worst hidden fears, ironically captivating and entertaining me at the same time. It reflects a different side of life, the forbidden and strange, unexplainable events. Intricately and beautifully crafted, the images are the main storytelling vocabulary. There is heart, metaphor, character, and action in every frame of this masterpiece. Film buffs and other careful viewers are treated to subtle nuances in lighting, angle, framing, and composition that enhance each line of dialogue, each action sequence, and the theme as a whole.

Love should be in time.,"Even if yin and yang are separated, love will bloom a gorgeous flower on the other side.

I watched this movie and Titanic in the same evening, Ghost is far better than the later. When watching Ghost, I did not move a step as I did not want to miss any detail.

A top one,"Patrick Swayze shines in his role as the charismatic boyfriend, while Demi Moore delivers a stellar performance as the enchanting and loving girlfriend.

Okay, some cheesy moments when Whoopi talks in public to Patrick the Ghost, not really suspenseful, special effects not wow in this day and age BUT it really made me ponder about the next phase of our small lives.

"beautiful, multilayered love story","Touching romance/fantasy/thriller about a successful bank executive whose life is shattered when he becomes the victim of a botched mugging. Once deceased he returns—in the hereafter—to not only find out why he was killed, but more importantly to protect his grieving girlfriend (Moore) from a similar fate. His only hope is to enlist the aid of a slick con artist (Goldberg) who possesses the uncanny ability to communicate with the living dead. A smart, entertaining, and heartfelt tale of love and redemption, with occasional touches of comedy and suspense, crafty special effects, and perfect performances from the three leads. Swayze is commanding as the unfortunate victim, Moore terrific as his lost love, Goldberg amusing and just right as a swindling spiritual adviser.

The way they look at one another is sexier than any of those very graphic ""love scenes"". They make a real romantic connection just through their eyes. Ghost not only has wonderful, likeable characters in Sam Wheat, Molly Jensen, and Oda Mae Brown, but it has an engrossing plot that moves right along. Entwined in all this is a beautiful score. The theme song ""Ghost"", written by Maurice Jarre specifically for the movie, is enchanting, and, of course, an oldie, ""Unchained Melody"", adds another magical touch to a magical film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love never dies.,"Now I'm sorry if you find the summary above trite in any way, but I figure if countless horrific tales say the same thing about evil then its only fair that we should have a lighter contrast to think about! The soul of ""Ghost"" is sweet natured; it offers a little something for everybody provided they are content to let the odd corny moment and occasional spot of sappiness slide.All of the cast do well (even Swayze, despite it reportedly being offered to every possible leading man in Hollywood before him) and the concept is a true crowd-pleaser because it contains elements that will appeal to a variety of different types. Sensitive folk will connect with the pure love story, thriller fans will enjoy the details of the plot, and fantasy buffs will appreciate the effects and the exploration of the afterlife. It's a blend of different styles that works well throughout, and is undoubtedly one of the key reasons why the film became such a big hit.Stealing the show is supporting actress Whoopi Goldberg. At times it feels like the part of her character was expanded upon when the creative team saw for themselves what she was going to be able to do with it. I don't know whether or not that's true, but it's such a memorable performance that every now and again it even eclipses the main romance.If you're searching for a piece of popular entertainment that's manipulative in a good way, then ""Ghost"" is a one-stop shop catering to all your needs.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Love From Heaven,"I adore ""Ghost."" It's a film that masterfully combines romance and glamour, sometimes even simultaneously. It skillfully melds sentimentality with the supernatural. The production values impress, with excellent special effects, costumes, lighting, sets, and cinematography. The soundtrack, particularly ""Unchained Melody,"" is emotionally resonant and used effectively. The script is of high quality, featuring a compelling love-beyond-the-grave theme and an ending that proves sentimentality can be powerful. Jerry Zucker's direction shines. The performances are notable, with Patrick Swayze delivering one of his finest as the murdered banker attempting to warn his girlfriend. Demi Moore, though initially unremarkable, improves as the film progresses. However, it's Whoopi Goldberg who steals the show with an outstanding performance that seamlessly blends into the narrative. In summary, ""Ghost"" is an outstanding film with a compelling premise, well worth watching for Swayze and Goldberg. Jerry Zucker, known for directing comedies like ""AIRPLANE!"" and ""TOP SECRET,"" successfully transitions to drama with this gentle romance, which has much to offer. Despite its abundant sentimentality and schmaltzy love scenes, the director handles them effectively. With numerous action sequences, including a standout chase scene and an excellent subway ghost scene, ""Ghost"" offers a satisfying blend of romance, comedy, thriller, fantasy, and mystery. It caters to those who appreciate heartwarming stories. Its well-deserved Oscar wins further highlight its quality.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Good actors, interesting story and so on - I don't need to recommend that further as a lot of people did it before me.But there's one thing, well, I didn't like at all, and that the others didn't mention: Well, of course, the characterization of heaven and hell and especially the hell's scum where quite clichéd and Hollywood typical,too pathetic the heaven, ridiculous hell... but it's a movie,that wasn't exactly the point I disliked, but: Why do the bad guys have to die? I mean - is it really a good solution to revenge murder with murder? Do they necessarily have to be KILLED, just, that it happens to them what they did to Sam? Well, he's dead and wishes them (from the beginning!) dead, too! And just because he's dead, well, does that set the movie apart from other ""self justice"" movies? That's what the makers must have thought. But self justice is never a solution. Sometimes it's understandable (still not right),there are some movies who handle that difficult topic quite well. But it definitely shouldn't be propagated completely uncritical by a movie - and that's what this one does!!!

A memorable classic.,"Ghost is a good blend of cheesy romance, humour, action, suspense and supernatural! The chemistry between Patrick Swayze and his two main female counterparts (Demi Moore & Whoopi Goldberg) on screen is very pleasant to watch & effortless! I think that the first 30 minutes or so is a bit slow, however the overall storyline is decent (despite some predictability too). But I think this film captures the notion of real life, the afterlife, grief, unconditional love and faith pretty well! A side note: I personally think that Whoopi's character (Oda Mae) really brings the entire movie together so her Oscar win for this supporting role is well deserved!

Something for everyone,"Although it might sound like a cliché phrase, I feel that ""Ghost"" is a film that has something for everyone in it. Such a combination of fantasy, romance, thrills, drama, and comedy would be risky in many other films, but it works very well here. The film involves Sam (Patrick Swayze), a man who is murdered on the streets and, as a ghost, discovers that the man who killed him also plan to kill his girlfriend (Demi Moore) and rob the bank at which he worked. He attempts to communicate with a psychic (Whoopi Goldberg, Oscar-winner for this role) and get her to warn his girlfriend. The main plot is a fantasy by nature, though the cross-genres are very evident here. It is a very romantic film, and I believe that Swayze and Moore have some of the greatest on-screen chemistry I've ever seen. There are thrilling scenes involving fights for those who like action movies. The film is also decently funny at times, mostly thanks to wisecracks and situations by Whoopi Goldberg. I have never professed to be a fan of Goldberg, but this role was completely enjoyable and made the whole film even more worthwhile. It takes about 30 minutes for the film to really get going, and some parts can be somewhat bizarre, but hold on. The rest of the film is excellent in just about every way. This is an all-time favorite, and I believe everyone can find some aspect of the film they can enjoy.***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

I will say that I found one twist somewhat predictable, but maybe I've just seen too many later movies before watching this. There is a lot of suspense in this film.

Everyone, even Patrick Swayze (Whose facial expressions are perfect in this film), did as great a job as the crew behind the scenes making special effects that were great for their time and some of which are still good today.

Scary and worth it,"While not considered a classic in the traditional sense, this film comes remarkably close to achieving that status due to its abundance of standout scenes. The narrative centers around Sam, a man who cherishes his fulfilling life, a stark contrast to the premise of the film ""Click."" Instead of fast-forwarding through his days, Sam's idyllic existence is abruptly cut short when he is tragically killed, only to return as a ghost. This aspect of the story, where Sam retains the ability to interact with the physical world while other departed souls cannot, may be viewed as a minor flaw. However, the strength of the characters and plot is so compelling that this inconsistency hardly detracts from the overall enjoyment of the film.Sam's discovery that he can communicate with a counterfeit spiritualist, portrayed by Whoopi Goldberg in a role executed with remarkable skill, may seem somewhat cliche. Yet, the film's engaging narrative and character development easily overshadow this familiarity. Without revealing spoilers, it's worth noting that the movie delivers a satisfying experience, blending elements of romance, humor, logic, adventure, suspense, and memorable scenes that captivate the audience.Numerous standout moments contribute to the film's allure. Whether it's Sam trailing his friend to the killer's hideout, interactions with his friend that are nothing short of iconic, or the sequences involving Whoopi Goldberg's character navigating the bank, each scene adds to the film's charm. Noteworthy scenes also include Sam's encounters with enigmatic dark figures, particularly the emotional depth displayed when Sam shows compassion towards a malefactor in a poignant and heroic moment, despite the wrongs committed against him.The film's ability to evoke such a range of emotions and its adept portrayal of character dynamics make it a truly enjoyable watch. It seamlessly weaves together elements of humor, suspense, and genuine human connection, culminating in a movie that resonates with audiences on a profound level.

Tony Goldwyn plays his business partner while Whoopi Goldberg is on hand as a psychic spiritual advisor.Like all great movies, ""Ghost"" (1990) takes about 15-20 minutes to establish the characters and then takes off, gripping the viewer until the end. It combines drama, thrills and comedy in its fascinating exploration of the hereafter and is cut from the same cloth as future movies ""City of Angels"" (1998), ""Meet Joe Black"" (1998) and ""The Sixth Sense"" (1999).While the film's theology is no deeper than a Jack T.

I can sense Adam Greenberg howling at the special effects supervisor. It leaves me wondering how much better it could be made today from just a technical standpoint. Swayze did his best work here and injected just the right level of humor and horror--- unfortunately some of it is marred by less than state of the art SFX work (oddly, I could make the same argument to STARMAN, albeit Jeff Bridges' performance was far superior).

More than just a movie,"_A Timeless Romance that Transcends Mortality: A Review of ""Ghost"" (1990)_Jerry Zucker's ""Ghost"" is a beautifully crafted romantic thriller that has stood the test of time, captivating audiences with its timeless tale of love, loss, and redemption. Released in 1990, this iconic film tells the story of Sam Wheat (Patrick Sweeney), a young banker who is brutally murdered by a colleague, leaving behind his grieving fiancée, Molly Jensen (Demi Moore).As Sam's spirit lingers on earth, he finds himself unable to move on, desperate to communicate with Molly and protect her from harm. With the help of a quirky psychic medium, Oda Mae Brown (Whoopi Goldberg), Sam must navigate the afterlife and find a way to make contact with Molly, all while unraveling the mystery surrounding his own death.One of the standout aspects of ""Ghost"" is its beautifully nuanced performances. Patrick Sweeney and Demi Moore deliver heartfelt and convincing portrayals of star-crossed lovers, their on-screen chemistry palpable and authentic. Whoopi Goldberg, meanwhile, steals every scene she's in, bringing a much-needed injection of humor and wit to the film.The film's screenplay, penned by Bruce Joel Rubin, is a masterclass in storytelling, expertly weaving together elements of romance, thriller, and fantasy to create a truly unforgettable cinematic experience. Rubin's writing is both poignant and humorous, tackling complex themes like mortality, grief, and the afterlife with sensitivity and wit.Visually, ""Ghost"" is a stunning film, with Zucker's direction bringing a lush, atmospheric quality to the proceedings. The film's use of lighting, cinematography, and special effects is equally impressive, creating a truly immersive and believable world that draws the viewer in and refuses to let go.One of the most iconic aspects of ""Ghost"" is its memorable soundtrack, featuring The Righteous Brothers' haunting rendition of ""Unchained Melody."" This timeless classic perfectly captures the film's themes of love, loss, and longing, its soaring vocals and sweeping orchestration adding an extra layer of emotional depth to the film's already poignant narrative.If ""Ghost"" has a flaw, it is that the film's pacing can feel a bit uneven at times, with some scenes feeling slightly overlong or meandering. However, this is a minor quibble in an otherwise exceptional film.Overall, ""Ghost"" is a timeless romantic thriller that continues to captivate audiences with its beautiful story, memorable performances, and iconic soundtrack. If you haven't seen this film before, do yourself a favor and experience it for yourself - but be prepared to laugh, cry, and maybe even believe in the power of true love.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Mostly good film, just a shame about those horrible damnation scenes","I must say that, in most respects, I found 'Ghost' a very good film.  It made me laugh, it made me cry, and it probably made me feel a lot of other things too.  The only parts of it I really did not like were those truly horrible scenes where assorted bad guys die and are shown being dragged off somewhere probably-not-at-all-nice by ghastly shadowy spectres or demons. Were those scenes really necessary?",,Anonymous,Romance

I can and can't understand!,"I can and can't understand about the way the Oscars went with this movie. I'm glad Whoopi Goldberg got her Oscar because she deserved it and the screenplay was good, but this movie should've gotten best picture too. Ghost has a pretty good storyline although I don't see how Sam would want to kill Carl and Willie after he finds out that they killed him because they were dealing with drug dealers so they wouldn't get killed.  Other than that, it was great too!  And other than the swearing, I felt Sam's anger and rage when he finds out why he was killed, especially when his friend betrayed him.  I'd be pretty mad too! I mean, we all have one life, why take another?  And after finding out that Rick Aviles was also a comedian, it surprised me that he could play a killer and not show any comedy at all except for the part when he jokes around after Carl told him about Oda Mae Brown knowing about him.  When I first saw this movie, although I was only a little kid, I thought it was a horror movie because of the objects flying at Willie near his death scene and then the demons from Hell coming and taking him.  That part gave me the creeps.  Although, being the spiritual Christian I am, I am not agreeing with the way they handled life after death in this movie, overall this movie was excellent.",,Anonymous,Romance

10 stars only for Tony Goldwyn,"Tony Goldwyn as Carl Bruner does one of the best jobs in movie history for a guy deeply in panic - maybe, similar to the airplane episode in ""Twilight Zone"". Thats why I still like to watch the movie when its on the TV. Forget about the love, the magic, the cheesy special effects and the crooner music. He is playing a guy who notices to late he has made one mistake too much, and even for greedy intentions, and later is sweating his brains out. Best moment in the movie, when he notices he was framed by Whoopie. I may switch off ""Ghost"" later, but I never miss that moment. Otherwise - Demi Moore with a worse hair cut then in G.I. Jane, and it even inspired girls at the time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Whoopi Goldberg 92% Sub Saharan African descent,"This is great film making. Walter Murch did the editing. Look at the subway scenes with both Patrick Swayzy and Vincent Schiavelli and the cuts into and through the subway and walls. Murch makes magical cuts. Then there is the screenplay by Bruce Joel Rubin. It has romance, comedy, ghosts, psychic seances and thrills. Next Maurice Jarre did the score. Unchained Melody will have you crooning along. But Whoopi wows me. I love her face. I love her. Of course Patrick Swayze is wonderful with Demi Moore looking so beautiful. The black ghosts are so scary looking when they carry off the bad ones. Money laundering was never so much fun.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Behind of a love story, the inexorable truth!!!","Ghost at its release time was an instant classic, and now thinking that a dozen great actors turn down the role which made Patrick Swayze a star, this moving picture was well-conceived by the smooth writer Bruce Joel Rubin and directed outstandingly by the comic cognizant Jerry Zucker who proves be an eclectic director ever since.In a meaningful way is how was developed all key points concerning in post-mortem experience with priceless details, the writer quite sure request a grueling survey from many psychics also in thematic books to enable take to scream something never seen before, in Brazil has around 5% of Spiritualist which I've include myself and near of 30% of the entire population somehow believe in life afterlife and past lives as well, according my studies on this field almost 30 years all feature content is whatsoever are truth, apart the romantic couple Swayze-Moore who stand out is the quack Whoopi Goldberg who sees her mediumship suddenly blooms, she improves rather the character of the charismatic Oda Mae Brown with her vein comic style.Thus worthwhile the producers wait and postpone the casting process of Oda, Whoopi has offers himself at first, but the director refuses her to be so renowned, so many had attended to the screen test, no one fits as planned, then Swayze asking for Whoopi has a chance and she got it, also the forgotten Vincent Schiavelli as Ghost train, what a fabulous acting, I'm quite sure I'll be bomb with negative votes but the song was so sugary to my taste, sorry!!Thanks for reading.Resume:First watch: 1991 / How many: 4 / Source: VHS-TV-DVD / Rating: 9.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
This one of the most touching love story,"This may not be a classic, but it comes close. It has one big attribute of most great movies, a lot of great scenes. The story is about Sam, who has a great life, and this movie is the opposite of CLICK. Unlike that stupid movie, this guy doesn't want to fast forward his life with a beautiful loving wife and great career. But it is taken away from him when he is killed. He becomes a ghost. And that might be one of only two flaws in the story. Why he can project his needs when billions of other dead souls can't. But a great movie like this endears us to the characters and plot enough so that this is a very trivial flaw. He finds he can communicate with a fake spiritualist (Whoopi, in a role few could do as well), which is the second flaw, since we have a feeling we've seen this character in this instance all too often. Hoever, again, if the movie is good enough we can overlook this. Without making spoilers, I can only add that the movie satisfies the viewer. There is romance, humor, logic, adventure, suspense, and great scenes. Among the great scenes that make the movie (I'll only mention some) are the scene where Sam follows his friend to the killer's apartment (actually just about every scene with his friend is classic), the scene where Whoopi goes to the bank, the scene where she leaves the bank, the scene where Sam is a ghost in the office with his friend, the scene where the friend hits on Sam's woman, the first scene with the little dark men, the second scene with the little dark men...I could go on and on. What is lost in all of this is one of the greatest emotional bits of capturing character ever, when Sam realizes what is going to happen to an evil man when the little dark men appear the second time, and he expresses true sorrow and compassion for a man who stole so much from him. This is one of the most poignant and heroic scenes ever in any movie I would find it very hard to believe anyone could not enjoy this movie. Truly a winner. Know what? This is a classi.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Ditto! A love letter to say ""I love this film"". Classic","Masterpiece. I am moved so much in this film. At first, looking at the poster, I thought it is an erotic film but I wondered why the synopsis felt like it is more like ""Wing of Desire""-sque approach film. So I decided to watch it and it did not disappoint.It is simply one of my favourite movie. No wonder why it is a cult classic film and has a lot of pop culture reference and following. Specially on that steamy pottery making part, the chemistry between two cast (Demi Moore and the late Patrick Swayze) is astounding. I love Whoopi Goldberg role in this movie she did a comic relief in this film but hey she portray his part flawlessly. Drama, comedy, thriller and a bit suspense makes me goes with flow in this film and ride in different emotion it want to show in this film. I would consider this as one of my favorite romance film for it is being rewatchable. When you hear that ""The Righteous Brother song Unchained Melody"" one thing comes with your mind. This film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Whoopi Was Great! - Premise was not,"Whoopi Goldberg was a hoot in this picture. I think she is the highlight.The main point of the story was not that the good guy became a ghost and pined for his live girlfriend, but that the bad guy was trying to find and steal the good guy's computer password. What did he expect to find in Patrick Swayze's wallet, a piece of paper that said ""My password is....?"" Pretty silly.",,Anonymous,Romance
Who You Gonna Call?,"This film has always been one of my favorites. From start to finish it just takes you on a roller-coaster of emotions. The heartfelt passion and symbolic love-gestures taken on by the characters and expressed in deeply profound and moving ways just makes my very flesh electric with giddiness. When the first ghost appeared in the library I was genuinely frightened, but with timely doses of humor, the fabulous cast of actors got me through it just fine. My favorite character in the movie would have to be Peter Venkman. Played by a charming Bill Murray, Venkman handles the responsibilities of friendship with three coworkers and Dana Barrett, his love interest with startling believability. I to wish I could have friends as whimsical and intelligent as Spengler, Stantz, and Zedmore. It must be difficult to run a ghost-catching service and still have time for the little things in life like romance and everlasting friendships. When I first saw this film Slimer the ghost really spooked me out big time. Now I see he is just comic relief, and he like us the moviegoer are just along for the ride, and what a ride it is.",,Anonymous,Romance

Okay,"Whoopi Goldburg's oscar winning performance gives this film what life it has.  Otherwise, it's just a routine romance with a spot of comedy.It did not deserve a Best Picture nomination over Reversal of Fortune, The Grifters, The Rapture, Postcards from the Edge, Journey of Hope, etc.  It didn't make my top ten of the year.See it once, for Goldburg's performance.  You won't really want to see it again.",,Anonymous,Romance
Get Real!,"Dull artist loses her even duller husband in some type of N.Y. street violence.  African-American woman is out to con the widow out of her money by pretending to be a channeler of the dead.About the only thing mildly interesting in this quasi-bit of celluloid entertainment is Goldberg's Oscar winning supporting role as a pretend psychic who turns out to be a latent psychic.There's nothing worse than a romance, trying to become a comedy, trying to become a horror story.  The lead actors (Swayze and Moore) are still as dislikable as they are in previous and subsequent films (I mean, who really saw Swayze in anything other than 'Dirty Dancing,' and what drugs was Moore taking when she agreed to appear in 'G.I. Jane and 'Striptease?').Not even the 'oh, my darlin' love theme (still beautiful, but I forget who sang/composed it) could save this unintentional nightmare from making me want to hurl.  Watch this one with 'Ghostbusters' as a double feature on 'Mystery Science Theater 3000.'",,Anonymous,Romance
seed  of  emotions,"bad acting ? atheistic message ? propaganda for spiritualism ? only blind verdicts. because this film is a basic love story. nothing else. or, far from aesthetic values, it is beautiful message for soul ( hot soup for soul ). a romantic movie, tender, delicate, subtle, out of great ambitions, a moral lesson and argument for a general hope - death is not the end, love is strongest bridge.. sure, the cast is nice and music - Woopi Goldberg is really fantastic. but axis is music. touching, magic, persuasive.it is not wise to put it in a Procust bed. because important is final feeling. like a spell, like touch of flavor, like sparkle of pure joy.the rest can be silence.",,Anonymous,Romance
Oscar fluke number five hundred seventy,"The comedy scenes between Goldberg (who won the Academy Award)and Swayze give the film some heft, and the makers' idea of the little fellows who take us to hell rather than heaven is genuinely spooky, but overall this cosmic afterlife-romance doesn't have a whole lot going for it.Still, to this day, viewers (women in particular) have rose-colored memories of the picture.  Most talk of the pottery/love making, or the awkward Goldberg/Swayze/Moore kiss-channeling scene, and an the film clearly struck a chord with movie-going masses and Academy members back in 1990.Are there any films that deserved the Best Picture slot that it miraculously managed to snag?  No, unless you count the gruesome independent classic ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"", the majestic sci-fi allegory ""Total Recall"", the tense, hard-boiled con game ""The Grifters"" or Whit Stillman's fearsome dramedy ""Metropolitan"".  And besides the fact that I'd rather have seen ""GoodFellas"" take up TWO spots on the Best Picture voting ballot than ""Ghost"" once (who wouldn't have?), I can very nearly see how it finagled a chance to go for Hollywood's top prize.""Ghost"" isn't entirely dislikable--not at all.  But its high-concept ideas (from ""Jacob's Ladder""'s Bruce Joel Rubin, no less!) to its slick, by-the-numbers execution have probably done more for the independent film movement than three of ""Pulp Fiction"", two ""Clerks"", and a half hour of ""Sling Blade"" put together.  In the early nineties, like many other times over the past century, young men and women sat up, pricked up their ears, and in unison, cried ""Well heck!  Even I can do THAT!""  Today, it is they who are winning the awards.In short--thank you, ""Ghost"".",,Anonymous,Romance
