"Amusing, if extremely raunchy","This quasi spin-off of Forgetting Sarah Marshall is definitely not as good as that comedy classic, though it has its moments. The music is straight up great. It's impressive that the songs in this satire of music films is better than most actual music films. The cast is reliable and there are plenty of legit laughs, however some of the raunchiness can be a bit much. It lacks the heart or consistency of FSM, but it's still a pretty entertaining comedy that makes good use of its stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A Surprise Gem,"I remember when I first saw the ad for this I said ""There's no way in hell I'm seeing that crap"".Low and behold, I was wrong as my girlfriend demanded we go and see Russell Brand ""be his sexy self"". I never saw it personally. Is it just the accent or is there something else about the greasy haired skeleton with an oversized skull that gets girls knickers soaking?Anyway, holy crap! I learned to not judge a book by its cover. Jonah Hill as the straight man with Russell as the comic was a brilliant combination and they bounce off of one another in superb fashion.Russell is a carefree rockstar who takes drugs like skittles, misses his ex and starts controversy like he's Kanye West mixed with the Sex Pistols whilst Jonah plays a dweeby fanboy who has to make sure that his hero makes it on time to his own concert. This proves rather difficult as Russell would rather take drugs and have copious amounts of sex to avoid thinking about his horrid relationships with friends and family.It's shot well, the music is not only original but actually funny and every actor plays their part tremendously.The story is okay, not brilliant and the ending is expected.I went in expecting crap so I was pleasantly surprised.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A fun ride with a sudden stop.,"This is Nicholas Stoller's first mainstream film in which he both wrote and directed, exploring the high's and lows of Jason Segal's Forgetting Sarah Marshall's character ""Aldous Snow"".Aldous Snow is the controversial, alcoholic, drug addict rock star stereotype played by Russell Brand. He does it well and leaves us with a strong and convincing performance, but then It's hard to criticise his acting when he for the most part just plays himself, and to that point he does it well as always.The story-line is basic but strong, and doesn't skimp on the laughs... or the nauseating, leaving the theater in stitches and disgust several times throughout. It takes you on a journey of the highs and lows of life as a rock star, the publicly glorified side and the more somber, touching on the loneliness and struggles with relapse.It flew by fast and felt squashed at the end, the resolution was a tad jammed and left me slightly disappointed, but i'll be watching it again.If you liked the hangover, you'll defiantly like this.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A Hilarious Spin-off,"I was lucky enough to see this movie tonight as an advanced screening at my school.It is the funniest movie of the year so far and I think it will be a sleeper hit like The Hangover was last year. I loved Russel Brand's character in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but I was bit hesitant to see an entire movie based around the character. If you feel the same way as I did, stop! This was an excellent spin off with a great cast. If you love movies like Superbad and The Hangover, you will not be disappointed with this. Although, don't go in expecting another Forgetting Sarah Marshall, which is more of a romantic comedy. This is just 108 minutes (approx) of pure fun and a lot of crude humor.Russel Brand, Jonah Hill, and Diddy are flat out hilarious. I'll go far as to say that Diddy's character Sergio is to this movie as Russell Brand's Aldous Snow was to Forgetting Sarah Marshall. There are a lot of hilarious lines throughout the movie and a couple of awesome cameos.I haven't laughed as much as I did tonight since I first saw The Hangover last year. If you love comedies, then don't miss this! I highly recommend it.9/10",,Anonymous,Music
The Russell Brand Show,"Although the lead role was ostensibly played by Jason Segel, many reckon (and justifiably so) that Forgetting Sarah Marshall really belonged to Russell Brand, whose deranged - and, to some degree, autobiographical - performance as a womanizing, junkie pop star was a consistent laugh magnet. Not a big surprise, then, to find out that the character received his own movie, albeit described in official circles as a ""semi-sequel"" instead of a ""spin-off"" to avoid comparisons with previous, failed attempts to flesh out minor characters from popular films. Well, one thing is certain: for all its flaws (and there are a few), Get Him to the Greek is no Evan Almighty.Aside from Brand reprising his role as Aldous Snow, the only other on-screen link with Sarah Marshall, not counting a brief but fun cameo by Kristen Bell, is Jonah Hill, playing a different character this time. Gone is Matthew, the hotel employee with a weird fixation for Aldous; welcome Aaron, a California record company employee with a weird fixation for Aldous. In fact, he suggests that, in order to boost the company's success, they bring the British singer from London to L.A. for a big comeback concert. His boss Sergio (P. Diddy) agrees, on one condition: Aaron himself has less than three days to get Snow across the Atlantic. This proves to be more difficult than anticipated, as Aldous is off the wagon, pining over former flame Jackie Q (Rose Byrne) and generally prone to behavior that could wreck the whole operation. To quote Bette Davis, ""It's gonna be a bumpy ride"".With no aid from Segel (who participated merely as a songwriter), returning director Nicholas Stoller is on scripting duty as well, and retains the first film's showbiz satire angle. While that got a bit out of hand last time, a tighter focus (solely the music industry) allows for greater, more genuine laughs: as in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Aldous' outrageous lyrics are a hoot, and the presence of all the genre clichés - sex, drugs, booze, family issues, slutty girlfriends, et al - feels less trite and predictable than usual. Then again, not many movies begin with the ""hero"" proudly proclaiming himself ""the African Jesus"".On the flip-side, the rom-com material isn't equally strong, the main ""arc"" - Aaron's strained relationship with his girlfriend (Elizabeth Moss) - being a rather conventional and tired plot device that fails to convince throughout, climaxing in a cringe-worthy Chasing Amy spoof that wouldn't be bad if the storyline had been developed more carefully. A shame, because Moss, who proved to be the best thing in the dull Did You Hear about the Morgans?, shows once again that she has comedic skills to be reckoned with. The rest of the cast is just as reliable: the spotlight is inevitably on Brand, but the real standouts are P. Diddy's hilariously foulmouthed manager and Rose Byrne's spot-on ""troubled"" British singer, showing off a knack for comedy never even hinted at in her previous roles (well, 28 Weeks Later... is hardly laughing matter).All in all, perfectly acceptable Apatow stuff: inconsistent but solid laughs, a game cast, terrific soundtrack and some neat movie references. Hardly a genre classic, but the Kubrick joke alone makes it worthwhile.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Too much Snow will kill you...,"Man, you gotta love Aldous... but love him to a point of giving him a full movie about the character? Come on guys seriously. There are times that I replay Forgetting Sarah Marshall. But after watching this I feel I'm too Aldous-overdosed to watch it again.PRO(s)>> Jonah Hill's occasional funny lines (because his character doesn't require to, we wouldn't have the usual foul-mouthed characters he'd previously done).>> Sean Combs. His acting is average, but you gotta give the guy credit for being insanely-stupid funny as hell.>> Aldous Snow's songs. Seriously, in this movie the songs are the only reasons to love Brand's character>> The furry wall. I gotta buy me one of those. Watch this, you'll get what I'm sayin'.CON(s)>> Uninteresting storyline.>> The constant party/drugs scenes that were made to cover up for the uninteresting storyline. I gotta admit without these scenes, the film will likely to take up 30 mins screen time. The story is just that simple. I don't know, the crazy-stuffs works for me most of the time, but in this movie I felt like it was a bit overused, an excuse to patch it up to 2 hrs running time. I guess I got a bit tired of the Aldous thing going on. Not like other comedies I've watched when there's a hilly-billy threesome (Harold and Kumar), stupid-crazy Cops (Superbad), or a Vegas-fuckup scene (Knocked Up). Then only crazy scene that made me laugh was the one regarding the furry wall. That aside there's just Aldous on crack.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Time to thicken the stream,"This is one of my favorite comedies ever. I can not give it higher than an 8 because it has some weak spots, but overall I though Russell Brand and Rose Byrne give two of the great comedic performances of the 2000s. I enjoy a lot of the music, and there are some other standout moments, such as P. Diddy's ""Gamechanger"" scene. It's a very simple story, and it does try to hit some dramatic beats as well, but it's at its best when things get ridiculous.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Funny but disappointing,"I saw the premiere of this movie in Las Vegas at the Planet Hollywood hotel and casino. I loved Forgetting Sarah Marshall and I was really excited to finally see this movie, especially since it was with the cast. Sadly, I was disappointed.If you are looking for the Aldous Snow from Forgetting Sarah then forget it. No more ""Excuse me, missus, I've lost a shoe... like this one. It's like this one's fellow... it's sort of the exact opposite in fact of that - not an evil version but just, you know, a shoe like this"" or ""*after spilling cranberry juice on his shirt* Oh God, please take my eyes, but not the shirt! "". While Brand is funny as Aldous Snow at times, the character just isn't the same. Stoller expanded greatly on him in order for this character to be able to support a full movie, but I think he fell short of accomplishing this successfully and ended up robbing Aldous Snow of what made him so funny in the first place.Jason Segel wrote Forgetting Sarah Marshall and came up with this character in the first film. Nicholas Stoller, the director of Forgetting, directed and wrote this film without input from Segel and you can tell the difference. Aldous no longer has the funny and stupid lines that made him so memorable. Instead his character entertains by gross out humor and ridiculous actions. Some have warned that this movie is not like Forgetting and I completely agree; but what they haven't said is that Aldous Snow isn't the same character either. Sure, some elements have returned but, as stated above, what made this character great has not.You'd expect Russel Brand to carry this movie but he actually seems to make the movie drag on. Luckily, Jonah Hill manages to pick up some of the slack and Hill provides almost all of the funniest parts. It's sad that Russel doesn't deliver but I don't blame him for not living up to par, I blame Stoller for taking away what made Aldous Snow so funny in the first place.This is a good movie, but they shouldn't have marketed it as Russell Brand returning as Aldous Snow. I think this is giving people a false idea of what this movie actually is. If you go in expecting Brand to do nothing but flawlessly execute hilarious lines, like from the first movie, then be prepared to be disappointed. If you go in with an open mind and try to forget the Aldous Snow from the first movie then you might actually like it. Sadly, for me I went it wanting to see the Aldous Snow from Forgetting Sarah Marshall and left wishing this film was better.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Fantastic Spin-Off,"Opening up with the shooting of Aldos Snow's latest music video and then showing his downward spiral that leads to present day was the hilarious, perfect beginning for this innovative comedic spin-off. If you saw 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall' then this is exactly what you would expect a movie about Aldos Snow to be like. This movie has a heart that I did not expect to see, it's buried under lewd, vulgar and brilliant wit, but it's in there.Russell Brand just opens his mouth and his words are comedic gold. Jonah Hill takes a step out of his comfort zone, a bit, and plays a ""no confidence good guy"". (Usually he's the overconfident prick, for all you naysayers). Diddy delivers a surprisingly strong performance that I'm sure shocked anyone who sees him. He's actually hilarious! His repartee with everyone he comes into contact with is spot-on. The entire cast has hilarious one-liners and the two main characters really make this movie a joy to watch.The plot is actually a creative one, something we don't see a lot of nowadays. Albeit the humor treads into ""familiar gross-out"" jokes, there are clever jokes too. But it's all you have to expect when following ""Rock and Roll personified"". Another point I was surprised by was that a lot... a lot of the scenes from the trailers were not in the movie. I thought that was a good and bad thing. Good because it didn't show us stuff we've already seen and gave us the chance to see new stuff. But bad because a few of the scenes were real funny.For the critics who are hating this movie: Do you like comedy? Do you like Apatow's stuff? Do you like Russell Brand or Jonah Hill? If the answer is no to any 2 of these... why are you reviewing this movie? Your opinion is pointless for the people that actually DO like these movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Ridiculous and funny thanks to Jonah,This was surprisingly funny for quite a few parts. I don't care much for Russell Brand but the funny Jonah Hill carries it home. He is truly funny and has proven this in many films. While Russell Brand is the Kardashian of film (exists with no good purpose) Jonah enhances its comedic value. The two make a good combo in this film. Some over the top scenes are handled well and it takes some alright direction to make a doable trip full of drugs and crazy behaviour. Not too bad.,7.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Fat, Drunk and Stupid is no way to go through life, son""","Apologies to the writers of ""Animal House"", but Dean Wormer's comment to Flounder is just so apropos to the character(?) played by Jonah Hill.I tried to convince our friends to choose something else besides this, given all of the reviews I'd read and the trailers that I'd seen. But, someone else was paying, so I went along, figuring it couldn't be THAT bad. Well, a couple of our friends walked out within 10 minutes and saw a different movie. Wish I'd followed their lead.This movie was vulgar for the sake of being vulgar and gross for the sake of being gross. If there was supposed to be a message, it was lost in the tsunami of bodily functions, profanity, drugs and alcohol that never stopped.All in all, a waste of time and money to anyone outside the 13-25 demographic. Then again, that's where the cash must be nowadays, Hollywood keeps targeting them almost to the exclusion of the rest of us.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Amusing Wild Ride,"(Flash Review)What would you do to keep a reckless rock star under control? A record company is looking for ways to increase sales. A normal music loving guy, who works for the owner (Diddy) recommends reviving the name and career of a famous rock star named Aldous Snow. Thus, he now must shepherd this the crass, substance abusive and rambunctious rock star from event to event. Not used to the rock star life, he must keep pace, keep them on schedule or lose his job. This had many wild, funny and unexpected moments that tipped into the raunchy side. The story flows right along through many twists and turns. A solid late night comedy option.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"The longer it goes, the worse and worse it gets.","Anyone who thinks this is good must be taking the same drugs that Russell Brand's character is in the movie. First off, you know going in with Apatow that it's probably not going to be a thought provoking, compelling storyline, so the comedy HAS to carry the film. Sadly (and honestly painfully) it doesn't, not even close. This is one of Apatow's worst films, if not THE worst. Jonah is funny to a point, but what was fresh with him (Superbad)in the past, to me has gotten old very quickly. There are a few instances that are funny, but nowhere near enough (tired, old, unoriginal bits we've seen before) and nowhere close to as funny as ""The Hangover"" (it was advertised to be), ""Superbad,"" or ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall."" The whole bit with Snow and his father is pointless (it's neither funny nor do they re-examine that relationship). The movie just drags on and on, not being funny, and they should have cut it by at least 30 minutes. After a short amount of time you just say ""Uncle,"" and hope that it ends.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Completely Ridiculous... and Awesome!,"This movie was great. I expected considering how much I enjoyed Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and how much I enjoy Jonah Hill in general. I was not disappointed. The only reason that I did not give this movie a higher rating was because it was so ridiculous and unbelievable. I could not stop laughing out loud in the theater and neither could the rest of the audience (which was decent sized for a mid week night time showing after release). If you do not like drinking, drugs, and sex than I would recommend that you do not even come close to this one. It is above the top in all three of those aspects. You may be offended by some things, but that is the whole point of the movie... enjoy it. See it soon, I foresee this one growing in popularity as word of mouth spreads. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Utterly disappointing,"I chose this flick because I want to get in a few laughs and I missed the show time for Toy Story 3. From the start of the movie, I was already alarmed that I had chosen the wrong movie what with the music video and the switching between the various newscast of Aldos Snow. I thought it would get better once we get into the meat of the story. I thought Jonah Hill will bust out a few good jokes, but most of the jokes just make me cringe instead of laugh. By the one hour mark, I wanted to leave, but stayed which is a mistake. In the end when he finally got to the concert, I thought it would be over, but no, they had to prolong it another little bit to extend the bore. I went in expecting something close to The Hangover and instead got 90 minutes of swearing and a few flashes of nudity. I don't know how anyone can rate this a 7 out of 10 or more.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Great funny characters and Jonah Hill is great,"Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) is a messed up rock star. He has a damaged relationship with his ex Jackie Q (Rose Byrne). Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) pitches an idea for a 10 year anniversary of Aldous Snow's successful Live at the Greek Theatre show to label head Sergio (Sean Combs). Aaron is given the chance to wrangle Aldous for his big chance.The Judd Apatow friends gather together to do another hilarious movie. Russell Brand is wonderously wild and childlike. Jonah Hill is a great straight man, charmingly funny and sweet. The combo is a home run. Even P Diddy is great as the bombastic exec. Jonah and Elisabeth Moss are hilarious together in the beginning. The Sarah Marshall call back is hilarious. But it's not just all hilarity. Aldous has real personal problems and not just about the drugs. It's a wonderful mix of heart and comedy. Start stroking the fury wall.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Funny, Dark, and Thoughtful","While there is no doubt that the comedy in this film stretches through different layers it also captures the visual dangers of narcotics. If anyone has been in that situation before I'm sure it will seem familiar. It cannot compare to the likes of ""Trainspotting"" or ""Hot tub Time Machine"", it seems to lie between the two.Personally I didn't think a film, of this genre, could be serious and funny at the same time, yet it captures the realism of the care free lifestyle whilst entertaining you in only a way Russell Brand could, who is a seriously under rated actor, but ""PD"" lends this movie most of the laughs, which I thought surprising.Cringe moments, but definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"Jonah Hill, Russel Brand, Hilarious of course!",This movie stars Russel Brand and Jonah Hill and is written by the same people who made forgetting sarah marshall so Russel plays the same character.

So he has to put up with Aldouses sex and drugs life style and try to get the rocker to the Greek on time.This is a very funny movie as long as you don't mind some drug use and some follow language.

A worthy spin-off to Forgetting Sarah Marshall?,"""When the world slips you a Jeffery, stroke the furry wall.""Forgetting Sarah Marshall is one of my favorite movies ever (no exaggeration, I probably could watch it once a week without getting tired of it), so it goes without saying that I had mile-high expectations for this spin-off. And while Get Him to the Greek isn't bad by any means, I don't think it lived up to either Forgetting Sarah Marshall or it's own potential.Russell Brand and Jonah Hill are funny guys, so it may come as a surprise that the two funniest people in the movie were Rose Byrne and Sean Combs. They were both hilarious. Brand's character seems to be more reigned in this time around, and doesn't get to be nearly as funny as he was in the previous movie, where he stole the show. The great (and hilarious) songs from FSM were also replaced with some that weren't nearly as funny or clever. Hill gets some funny moments, but the stuff with his girlfriend (the awesome Elisabeth Moss in a small role) just never came off as particularly interesting or genuine. I get that the filmmakers were going for that mix of humor and relationship stuff that made FSM have such a wide appeal, but that's a tricky thing to pull off and the formula doesn't work as well, here.I'm sure my review seems harsh, and I don't mean it to be that way. Get Him to the Greek is a decent comedy. Some parts were quite funny. But to be honest, as the movie went along the jokes began to fizzle out until I was almost bored for the last 15 minutes. Check it out, but I doubt you'll be in a hurry to see it again soon.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Get Him: 7/10,"Russell Brand, Jonah Hill, and Diddy. You put all three of them into a movie and you get this hilarious and raunchy comedy. This is probably one of the good comedies of the year 2010. Talk about a bad year in movies, there is practically no good comedies these days. Comedies like Killers, Sex and the City 2, Cop Out, and Furry Vengeance all bombed in the box office and critics hated them. Although Get Him to the Greek is raunchy and full of sex jokes, it still got me laughing my ass off. I enjoyed this very much and writing a long review for a comedy like this isn't my style. But the IMDb guidelines don't allow less than 10 lines of review so forgive the stupid rule and this junk.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Very very funny,"When I saw the trailers for Greek, they looked moderately funny. I hadn't seen Sarah Marshal, so I had no idea what that was all about. But, reviews were good and I thought, hey, what the heck. What I found was a very funny Apatow-filmish take on the rock n roll film. All the elements of a usual Apatow troop film are there: focus on unusual moments, sex drugs and gross out humor, friendship and some serious moments, and the breaking down of typical film trappings. Suffice to say, this is a great summer comedy.The film, as many know, charges Allen Green with getting washed up rock star Aldous Snow to the Greek Theater in LA for a 10th anniversary concert. As one would guess, things don't go accordingly, and a whole lot of comedy ensues. The film, more than anything, is essentially a rock pic. It's about the life of this rock star who has burned out his bulb and is attempting to put in a new one. And as Aldous Snow, Russel Brand is fantastic. He truly embodies this rock star and you feel he really IS this character. He boozes it up, drugs it up, sexes it up, and whatever other manner of things a rock star might abuse. He's a mess of a guy, and like so many famous people who have gone south, he's a complicated person who has let fame get the best of him. This is translated extremely well. Despite all the comedy, this is an excellent rock and roll biopic type film. Jonah Hill is great as the lead character with baggage of his own and he does what he does best here, although he plays a more awkward kind of character versus his geek-in- charge style that we're so accustomed too.Stealing the show, however, is Sean Combs, who plays Green's boss Sergio. Every scene he is in is hilarious and he is surprisingly funny. It was definitely pleasant to see him pull off such a funny role. The other supporting characters are great, doing a fine job of being very funny themselves. Most of the film falls into stages of comedy bits, and all are pretty damned hilarious. There's nothing here that's too ridiculous, which is nice. There is once scene that kind of makes you raise a brow, but it's just so damn funny, you forget how insane it is. And that's really the charm of the film. Everything about it is larger than life, yet believable. This is exactly why it perfectly molds both the rock star film and an Apatow comedy so perfectly. It's the kind of comedy you would expect it to be, while not knowing exactly what is going to happen. If you don't like these kinds of comedies, this one may not be for you. But if you've enjoyed other films like Sarah Marshal, Pineapple Express, and other Apatow troop films, you'll find Greek hilarious. I know I did.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Brand is doing his usual bit as well but i'm not familiar with his routine so its not too bad at first.

A slight disappointment for a big fan of Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"A movie spin-off of Nicholas Stoller's previous film, Forgetting Sarah Marshall. That was one of my favorite comedies of the year in 2008. In fact, I include it fairly high on my top 10 list of that year in general. And Aldous Snow (played by British comedian Russell Brand) was part of the reason for that movie's success, for sure. So, alas, Snow's spin-off movie is unfortunately a mild disappointment. Jonah Hill (who had a small role in Sarah Marshall but plays a different character in this) works for a record company. He has an idea to re-ignite the fading rock star's career by having him perform a ten year anniversary gig at the site of one of his biggest triumphs. But, of course, Snow is a pampered rock star who likes to party constantly and do whatever the Hell he wants, and Hill is kind of a pushover. It's a simple story, and one that has been done before. All you have to do is string some good jokes along and it should work. It does work much of the time, in all honesty. It even has some good characters. I especially love Elisabeth Moss (Mad Men) as Hill's overworked girlfriend. And P. Diddy is actually really funny as Hill's boss. Colm Meaney (whom I always remember from Star Trek: The Next Generation) is also good as Snow's father. The film is sporadically funny - hilarious at times, even. But for some reason it always feels like it's kind of shallow and just not funny enough. Forgetting Sarah Marshall really scored by having just enough real emotion in the film that we ended up caring for the characters. I don't think this one ever gets that far, though it does try. Maybe Sarah Marshall's screenwriter (and star) Jason Segel should have collaborated on the script with Stoller. This film is still well worth a rental if you liked the first film. Kristen Bell has a nice cameo as Sarah Marshall in the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Someone Forgot The Laughs,"I liked the idea. I liked the character from ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall."" I fully anticipated, and wanted, a hilarious gross-out farce. Sadly, someone forgot to include the laughs, as they tried to get us to care about these characters. The opening was funny, depicting rocker Aldous Snow's pretentious fall, but the laughs soon dried up. This film reminded me of the flawed and ill- structured ""Funny People."" Both films desperately wanted to you laugh and care about the characters. Both films failed. ""Funny People"" was the better of the two. It had the head start of a better script and better acting. (But, come on, who really wants to see Adam Sandler in another dramatic turn?) A disappointment.",,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly great film,"Finally! A comedy that doesn't bank of copious amounts of stupidity and overused jokes to ""entertain"" its audience. Get Him to the Greek actually managed to entertain me enough to be considered not just another silly comedy. It's not to say that the film isn't silly, or raunchy, or over the top, but it's all done in a fashionable manner. It had me laughing practically through the entire film. In Get Him to the Greek Russell Brand reprises his role as Aldous Snow, a self destructive rock star whose first appearance was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall in 2008. At this point in time, however, Aldous is a has-been rocker after the utter failure of his last studio album. Jonah Hill plays Aaron Green who is a record company intern who is in charge of setting up Aldous Snow's reunion concert at the Greek Theater in L.A. Aldous proves to be absolutely uncontrollable and completely insane. He fits all the criteria of a true rock star. He's got a big personality and attitude, he's addicted to booze and women, and he's also on drugs. Lots of drugs. The ensuing journey is full of shocking hilarity and scandalous behavior.The great thing about Get Him to the Greek is that it is just a comedy that pulls out all the ridiculous stops, but I can actually go as far to say that it is a well made film and slightly more credibility than just some good laughs. Russell Brand is hilarious as the overzealous drugged up rock star and Jonah Hill, while I do tire of his typecast role, does a great job here, stepping up his game to a slightly higher maturity level while still retaining his quirkiness. And Brand and Hill together as a pair do fantastic. Their chemistry is completely there and provides for some great character interaction with increasingly funny results. The supporting cast do a great job as well with people like Rose Byrn playing Aldous' ex-girlfriend Jackie Q who sports an adorably hilarious Australian/British hybrid accent. There is also P. Diddy Combs who plays the manager of the record company Aaron works for. He impressed me with some of the most twisted and monumentally funny moments of the whole movie. The whole cast has fun with this one and they don't refrain from going as far into the insane world of rock and roll as they can.The other great thing about this movie is that it is a movie about rock and roll. It's a comedy first but it actually has legitimately rocking scenes that are so fun and exciting that you can't help but enjoy the rocking grandeur of this comedy. It's also helpful that the film succeeds on these levels so that some of the issues can be forgiven. There are definitely some plot holes and odd moments that make you do a double take as to how reasonable this plot really is. The film also does seem to get lost in itself towards the end. It randomly squeezes in a bit of philosophical intrigue towards the end that breaks the flow of the film to an extent. Problems like these are excusable against the funny and entertaining backdrop of this film.In the long line of Apatow Production films Get Him to the Greek stands out as one of the funnier films. Its a great no holds bars comedy that you can find humor in somewhere. And despite the issues and the getting lost in itself, the film indeed has a heart. It's one of the few comedies that has come out in recent years that I would consider going back to re watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly Outstanding,"Many people won't get this movie, because it moves so quickly from extreme comedy to near tragedy, but that's the whole point of the film. Russell Brand is near genius in his portrayal of an out-of-control rock star has been, and Jonah Hill, for once, plays the low-key straight man. Another standout is Sean Combs as an over-the-top music exec. My husband and I saw this on a date, and we both loved it. Granted, it has plenty of profanity and some gross-out moments, but I felt all of those contributed to the message of the movie, which was about the extreme nature of the rock and roll lifestyle. Funny, poignant, and ultimately a feel-good story about friendship and forgiveness--and rock and roll!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
I thought this move would be stupid but it was actually very good.,"I'm not a fan of either Jonah Hill or Russell Brand and thought this movie looked stupid and wasn't worth watching, I really did not want to see it at all.My friends were telling me this movie was very good and I should see it, so I gave it a chance. They were right, It was surprisingly very funny and entertaining. I laughed through the whole movie until the end.I really enjoyed this movie, the only things I didn't like is Jonah Hill Pukes way too much, and there was so much sex and nudity it wasn't even sexy it was just raunchy.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Andrew Tape's review was right on the button,"Why do people find this type of humor entertaining? Barfing? Three-ways? Excessive drugs and alcohol? I guess it's just a generation gap. I thought it stunk. Nothing like the Hang Over. I didn't like the characters or the plot; therefore I didn't care what happened. I almost left the movie early. The one interesting thing I liked was the link with the Sarah Marshal movie and the commercial for her upcoming T.V. show. Even though that wasn't one of my favorite films either, it was a whole lot better than this piece of crap. I have to add more just to get the minimum 10 lines, so I'll add that I only went to this film because of the 7 plus rating I saw here. It was between this film and Grown Ups, and that had less than 4 stars. My guess is that Grown Ups will turn out to be a better film; not that I expect that much from it either. Kind of like Killers and Knight and Day. K&D was better, but still not a great film.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Greek,I like the bit how he had to get him to the Greek. What ever that means,10.0,Anonymous,Music
Where's the Greek?,"No Greeks here ... well at least none I could identify. But apart from my oblivious state of mind concerning the location of the Greek (not sure if this is a real thing they refer to, to be quite honest), this is a funny look with a lot of swipes at the music industry in general and celebrity status too.Just the beginning though is something that will alienate quite a few people. I saw the uncut version, so not sure of how much of the music video is in the regular cut. But let's just say yo can't be squeamish or on a political correctness path - this will not sit well with you. If you dislike Brand himself ... well that doesn't help either. I know some people who find him annoying and his role here does not help liking him more.I'm not saying he's playing himself (hey, that's not what I meant, though there are quite a few innuendos in this one, so who knows?), but for some what is portrayed here, is how they perceive him in actual life. Overall this is juvenille and quite vulgar from start to finish. Puff Daddy (Sean Combs) or whatever he's calling himself is quite the discovery ... let's get it on then",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Forgetting Aldous Snow,"Russell Brand reprises his role as Aldous Snow in this spin off of 'Forgetting Sarah Marshall'. The film starts off hilariously summarizing the rise and fall of rockstar Aldous Snow mocking many celebrity couples. Once Jonah Hill's Aaron Green makes his entry, the story shifts on Green getting Snow ready for a comeback concert and their pukish and sometimes funny adventure together. I would say that this film is somewhat better than the usual non-funny comedy that comes out of the Apatow factory. Expectedly, there's plenty of repetitive toilet humour and that does get annoying but most of the other tongue-in-cheek commercial works well. The pacing is sluggish at times and the movie feels very long. Russell Brand is great as the washed out rockstar. Jonah Hill is a lot less annoying than he usually is. Rose Byrne is terrific. P.Diddy Combs is wooden. Obviously, 'Get Him to the Greek' is not to be taken too seriously. It's easily forgettable but it did make me laugh a couple of times.",,Anonymous,Music
"So random, but still pretty damn funny","Yeah sure this has random scenes in it a LOT in order to funny, but I can't really complain about that much cause the scenes that they want it to be funny, is actually pretty hysterical. Every characters in this was hysterical to watch, especially cause of the funny but awkward dialogue that is exchange between the characters. P.Diddy was actually pretty good in this film as well, especially when he goes haywire. The story is pretty simple, it's about a rocker that has a name that should belong in some Harry Potter book hits rock bottom or just the lowest point in his career and the character played by Jonah Hill tries to get him to a Greek concert with the permission of the producer P.Diddy, although he doesn't allow it at first. Anyways there is a lot of random funny stuff that happens along the way, although the ending is actually quite predictable it's still a hilarious film even if the plot is typical of getting a guy from point A to point B. It's not a smart comedy or a clever one, but it sure as hell a hilarious one.7.4/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not Apatow's best, but still very funny!","www.ourfilmreviews.comJudd Apatow has elevated the genre of the raunchy-comedy to something more dignified and worthwhile than a sequence of scenes designed to gross you out. Ever since the release of his directorial debut, ""The 40-Year Old Virgin,"" Apatow has shown us that crude comedies can also have a lot of heart. The best film from the Apatow canon is ""Knocked Up,"" which he wrote and directed, but even the films that only bear his name as a producer have that same stamp of quality (""Pineapple Express,"" ""Forgetting Sarah Marhsall""). The lowest film (and it is a very low, so low I pretend it doesn't exist), bearing his name is the abominable ""Year One,"" a film that Dani and I walked out of 20 minutes in. With that anomaly aside, Apatow has provided us with some of the best and funniest comedies of the 2000s, which seems only natural as he also provided us with the best TV show of the 90s, ""Freaks and Geeks"". Also from that show came the careers of James Franco, Seth Rogen and Jason Segel, all of whom appear in at least one Apatow film.""Get Him to the Greek"" is another solid comedy from Apatow and his team. While it never achieves the hilarity of ""Superbad"" or ""Pineapple Express"" or the heart of ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" or ""Knocked Up,"" it still provides 109 minutes of good fun and a few big laughs. The film's plot is simple enough. If you want a synopsis just check out the trailer. It tells you everything you need to know. Jonah Hill is funny enough, but he lacks the charisma and depth of both Seth Rogen and Jason Segel. He is better suited in the supporting roles he usually plays. Russell Brand is also funny reprising his role from ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" as the egomaniacal, brain-dead rock star Aldous Snow. But surprisingly, the funniest person in the movie is P.Diddy. I didn't know he could act or be funny, but he does an excellent deadpan.This film succeeds for the same reason the other Apatow films succeed: It makes us laugh and also makes us care about whom we are laughing at. It is funny without feeling fake. So often comedies will have a character do something or act a certain way because it might be funny, but it betrays the authenticity of the character. As absurd as Aldous Snow may be, he and the rest of the characters in the film are acting out of real and identifiable human feelings and emotions, not out of a contrived and shallow script. We don't just see crude behavior for the sake of crude behavior. We understand the characters and the humanity behind what they do. And it is hilarious.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
So much puke,"It's not quite Pixar-like, Judd Apatow's streak of very funny, very good films, but it's close. As a producer, he's as close as it gets to Mr. Automatic, going from Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy to The 40-Year-Old Virgin to Talladega Nights to Superbad to Pineapple Express with only a couple Year One's and Walk Hard's to queer the run. Apatow's done it the right way, by surrounding himself with a gang of truly funny people and by recognizing what a lot of timid, gloss-obsessed Hollywood folks won't: that guys like Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Steve Carell and Seth Rogan could carry pictures. They're all... these are odd-looking dudes, these Apatowian fellas, and it's hard to make them look good blown up billboard size. But all of them can write their own jokes, all of them are funny, and as Hill proves in the new Get Him to the Greek, all of them can carry the weight of a big film on their back, despite their schlubbiness, despite the films not being SNL spin-offs. There's just talent and comedy, that's both fresh and charmingly old-fashioned. With Get Him to the Greek there's a weird bit of Hollywood story/actor oddness that evaporates as soon as the picture gets rolling: writer/director Nicholas Stoller is taking characters from a previous film that he directed (that was written by and starred Jason Segel), Forgetting Sarah Marshall, keeping one intact (Russel Brand's rock god Aldous Snow) and slightly tweaking one other (Jonah Hill's disturbed-fan maître d' becomes a shy music intern), and sets them loose in a completely unconnected narrative. Snow is the last true rockstar, recently fallen hard off the wagon post-a disastrous, career-threatening single about starvation in Africa called ""African Child"". Worried about slumping record sales and a label-head (the surprisingly entertaining Sean ""Diddy"" Combs) looking for ""the next thing"", intern Aaron Green (Hill) suggests the company return to its rock roots and sponsor a gig at the Greek theatre in L.A., to mark the 10th anniversary of a legendary Aldous Snow show. Green is sent to London to collect him, packing an adrenaline shot and instructions to do whatever it takes to get the slippery, deluded, hard-partying rock god to L.A. in three days. Very funny hijinks ensue.Brand as Snow is the spectacle, the wild spark that animates the whole film. Snow vacillates wildly from petulant artistic preciousness to aggressive junkie posturing to anarchic drug logic and back. Story-wise, tt's a dangerous thing to chance, as the rock-excess thing has been parodied to near-death. Brand, though, limns the edges of his chaos with occasional moments of human frailty. The film notes late in the going that Snow's self-appointed rock messiah is intelligent, and it's a small ignorable moment that speaks to the subtle bits of originality in the film's script and in Brand's performance: he's a pompous idiotic waster in true rock fashion, but there's a cruel, manipulative intelligence underneath it all that helps the whole film feel fresh and funny, even if it's going over well-trod Spinal Tap ground.The discovery of the film, though, is Jonah Hill as Aaron Green, the spectacular punching bag at the heart of a film that mercilessly visits every kind of humiliation and degradation on him. He stands square in the furnace blast of Snow's rock-superstar excess and the shrivelling, repeated ""mind f__ks"" of his conniving, unbalanced boss: he pukes, he's sexually assaulted by more than one person, he's threatened, cursed, party to a stabbing. But what makes Hill's performance truly funny is that while he is in essence a nebbish, a victim, a barf-coated ill-looking cannonball of a man he nonetheless retains a really kind of compelling dignity and oddly endearing self-confidence. There's a depth to Hill's performance in this film (and in Forgetting Sarah Marshall as well) that's actually special. He's not an oversize wild-man, he's not a tiny Michael Cera-esquire mumbler. He's doing something new, and it along with everything else in this film is very very funny. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Hilarious ""sequel"" to Aldous Snow's personal life since the events in Forgetting Sarah Marshall","This movie rocked the audience for what it was supposed to deliver. Great humor, fun times and of course, ludicrous situations and hilarious interpretations of those two main characters; Aldous Snow and Aaron Green. The story in this movie is filled with great situations that you would laugh your ass off. It has it's clicheic ideas at moments and you get the feeling that it might turn cheesy but right next there's something insane happening. The two characters are portrayed excellent by both Russell Brand and Jonah Hill, Diddy gave a solid performance as the clicheic routine-type of boss but with all these points in favor, Get Him To The Greek lacks of a great ending which brought the whole movie to down from what could have turn. The ending felt like it's just too much and tried to scream for ""Hollywood Mainstream"". Why ruin a very good comedy with a typical ending I don't know... The lack of ideas maybe??? This movie delivered the expected although being better than it's predecessor it's a rough thing to say.The execution of the movie was handled very well, the video editing and cinematography was something really really well handled offering some great visuals along the chaotic humor. Besides the technical aspect, Get him to the Greek felt like I've seen the best comedy this year but also felt like it tried too much. There were plenty of moments where you were not amazed but dumbed down by some situations which in a normal world wouldn't occur. What I've been dazzled about was though the Aldous Snow character which is so great written and played in such a wonderful manner by Russell Brand offering a visual entertaining face of the iconic rockstar that has everything a guy would want. The opposite, Aaron Green, is a nobody in world that has nothing to offer for him except him being an exception. Jonah Hill was so good in playing the insecure (clicheic) type of nerdie dude that clinches to his job and kiss ass in order to be recognized. There were so many funny moments were the actual hilarity stood in Jonah's ""straight-face"".In the end, I think this movie deserves the title of the best comedy this year thus far but it also leaves the door open for other comedies to kick it's ass, not like Kick-Ass but more like some Hangover kick-ass. It feels like the typical summer comedy but it's not. It's a deserving hilarious ""sequel"" to Aldous Snow's personal life since the events in Forgetting Sarah Marshall and by doing almost just that it succeeds in entertaining the audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Has its moments but that's it.,"Occasionally funny comedy that has its moments but feels pretty forced with its premised. Both Russell Brand and Jonah Hill have chemistry but they are not working with good material and the film is stolen from right under their noses by Sean P Diddy Combs, who gives a very funny performance and gives the film's few true laughs. I would have liked the film to be more about him but he's fine with the role he has.Its more and less a remake of ""My Favorite Year"" which had Peter O Tool but it lacks that film's showmanship. The film had potential but outside of a few moments of really funny material ( All thanks to Sean P Diddy Combs), there is really nothing here that can't wait for DVD.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Aldous Snow. We love you.,"Oh what a character. If you love Russell Brand, seeing this movie should be a no-brainer for you. His character was the best part of ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" and it's the best part of ""Get Him to the Greek.""If you enjoyed ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" be aware that Greek is far more outrageous and crude, even to the point of getting past that suspension of disbelief that is the holy barrier of Do-Not-Cross when it comes to these types of movies.Performances are top-notch (except for an occasionally overacting P. Diddy), and the production values are just tremendous. The ""music videos"" and occasional cameos are just masterful!Just be aware - there are a few exceptionally uncomfortable scenes, one of which is a huge misstep, and just very awkward (you'll know when you see it).Overall, though, a fun movie.

"Lame, uneventful, sexist, degrading, boring movie","This is just another one to add to the bunch of judd apatow type movies which include, tons of vulgar language-f-bombs (getting old), drug references, sexism towards women including over the top degradation, disrespect, female nudity, and being objectified. Lets see....did I miss anything else? oh ya, lack of creativity and originality. Seriously, these movies that come out seem to have all the same old characters in them and its getting quite annoying. Cant they think of something new besides offending people? its just not funny. And the sexist crap, can we really not get through a movie without throwing in naked women and strippers? its like the director makes certain that they humiliate the females and intentionally degrade them. I am growing quite tired of theses immature, senseless, sexist movies. Maybe if they were comical, they would be more tolerable. I guess I could see a pubescent teen being excited about this movie, cause like the others there is always the abundance of over the top sexual content, but a person that is a bit more grown up and looking for adult humor and maturity, I suggest you look elsewhere. Its embarrassing seeing movies where the adult men act like 15 year old boys. Its like we are going backwards in time and America is getting stupid from these movies.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

That said, talented writer/Director Nicholas Stoller gives us an oddball comedy, with laugh out loud moments (but they're few and far between).There's sex drugs and rock'n'roll, it's not as soul searching as Forgetting Sarah Marshall but doesn't half try, Get Him to the Greek is good crack if only to see the drunken stoned Vegas fight.",,Anonymous,Music
"Kind of an afterthought, but funny nonetheless","When I saw ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" I thought Jonah Hill was criminally underused, and thankfully this spin-off makes up for the damage. There was just so much juice left in that character, and it's all squeezed out here. Granted, it's barely the same character anymore (the obsessed fan schtick is mostly dropped), but the chemistry with Russell Brand is still very much there. And his girlfriend is Elizabeth Moss, that helps. The story isn't that inspired to say the least (trying to get somewhere but encountering troubles, AKA the plot to 80% of all comedies), but the great interaction between our main duo really manages to keep this show on the road. Even if some of the lines fall flat here and there, you just can't stay mad at this movie. Not great, but definitely good for some laughs.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

I liked the ties made within the movie to Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and thought the parts in London were funny and a few parts in Las Vegas and scenes here and there were funny. But a lot of the jokes felt forced and didn't seem as funny. Overall I would saw one should wait for this to get to DVD and then rent or buy it, because while this is a decent movie, it isn't all its predecessor was, that movie was funny throughout and never had a dull moment where one is checking their watch.

Get him back to rehab?,"n this new movie from the Judd Apatow comedy factory, a Hollywood recording company flack called Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) has the job of getting wildly unreliable, substance-abusing English rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) from London to LA for a concert in three days. He succeeds, just barely. And so does this unruly movie succeed, just barely, in entertaining you -- if gross-out parties and sex and such are your thing.Here's how Apatow movies work. The personnel move around and ideas are spun off earlier movies. Stoller, once an assistant and collaborator on Apatow's TV series ""Undeclared,"" directed the 2008 Forgetting Sarah Marshall, his first feature, using a screenplay by Jason Segal and starring Jason as a character spun off Segal's original daddy-of-them-all ""Freaks and Geeks"" TV series' lovelorn kid persona, Nick Andopolis. Brand was woven into Forgetting Sarah Marshall as the Aldous Snow character. It was a minor role, but one of the highlights of the movie. So why not spin out Aldous Brand into a screenplay devoted to him as the main character? And that's what they did. The question is whether Brand, a stand-up comic, is endurable over the length of a whole movie. Get Him to the Greek, a disheveled road movie with echoes of Todd Philips' very successful 2009 The Hangover (whose praise and profits these folks were doubtless not unaware of), is just a series of skits with a lot of barfing and partying. It's got its funny moments, and Brand is still himself a pretty droll fellow, but the story is very repetitive. (Economics commentator Paul Krugman and Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich are woven into this in cameos, but we doubt they'll have Apatow comedies spun out of their characters.)Apatow comedies involve a revolving list of co-conspirators who alternately act in, write, produce, or direct movies. Addous Snow, the outrageous, funny, sort of cool and sexy rock singer who keeps this movie going, is played by Russell Brand, a British comic who looks and dresses much like his character and, as detailed in his 2007 autobiography My Booky Wook: A Memoir of Sex, Drugs, and Stand-Up, once acted just like him too -- only, if anything, quite a lot worse. The difference is that Brand in real life has been clean and sober for years and regularly attends 12-Step meetings. Like Robert Downey Jr., he has lived the debauched addict life to the hilt (complete with nearly a dozen arrests) and so when he acts such a character, he's playing a version of himself. Brand's character, Aldous, went straight for a few years also, but then party-time began again, causing his longtime girlfriend Jackie Q (Rose Byrne), also a famous rocker, to cut off relations. Aaron's boss's idea is that a concert by Aldous commemorating a famous evening at the Greek Theater in LA ten years earlier when he was at his peak of popularity will revive both Aldous' fortunes and the company's.Jonah Hill is practically a comedy factory of his own by now. He was in the cornerstones of the Apatow movie empire, 40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up, and Superbad. He's just a straight man here, and to emphasize his straightness, he has a workaholic doctor-in-training girlfriend played by Mad Men's Elizabeth Moss. What's a nice girl like her doing in a gross-out comedy like this? The tone of Get Him to the Greek can be wildly uneven. As Aaron Green's record company boss Sergio Roma we have Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs, whose crisp delivery and absolute self-possession in his scenes seem to belong to a more verbal comedy with sharper timing. The British actors playing Aldous' mum and dad (Diana Stabb and Colm Meaney) come from a more realistic kind of comedy. There are mock-ups of rock videos by Aldous and Jackie Q, including Aldous' bomb, ""African Child,"" a mockery of rock stars' self-appointed and utterly skin-deep save-the-world poses. Brilliantly realized and perhaps the best things in the film, these again belong to something else, something parodic and outrageously witty, something with an elaborate, gorgeous mise-en-scène. But the base line of the movie unfortunately is simply crudeness, as exemplified by the parties where girls take their boobs out and the sequence when Aldous forces Aaron to place a balloon of heroin up his rectum on the way through airport security, or the (ha ha ha, ho ho ho) scenes when the obliging flack has to smoke a lethal joint called a Jeffrey or chug vodka and quickly becomes falling-down, upchucking sick-drunk.Russell Brand still is funny; and he delivers his rock singing sequences with impressive panache and some singing talent (some of the songs, though, are just utterly crude and tasteless). This time, Jason Segal is given a partial writing credit just for the ""characters' and Stoller himself did the screenplay; I'm not sure how good a writer Stoller is. There's not much room for character development in Aaron and Aldous' 24-hour-party trip. Take a look at Forgetting Sarah Marshall again. Jason Segal's lovesick guy was a well-honed persona, a character it's easy to sympathize with who has some depth. Feeling sorry for that guy and feeling sorry for Aldous Snow are two different things. Drunken addict behavior is colorful and exciting, alright (like a train wreck), but it's not very funny to watch somebody ruining his life. There are some keen observations about the addict mindset here. In Drugstore Cowboy the main character says the drug addict has control over how he feels because he creates his moods with chemicals. Similarly Aldous says his life is simple because his only worry is where his next high is coming from. He also has a suicidal moment, and performs on stage while badly injured because doing so brings joy to his audience and to him. In this sense Get Him to the Greek has a nice ending. But it take too long to get there.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Dreary,lame,rubbish","A dreadful unfunny mess for which Director Nicholas Stoller should take full responsibility . Russell Brand is a charismatic talent, Jonah Hill who plays opposite him as record company executive Aaron Green is not. The equal billing and screen time they receive, presumably for the benefit of American audiences, holes the film below the water line from the start. Hill is not up to it, and is miscast. The visual attraction of a tall handsome louche Brand and a short fat ugly Hill,I can accept. What I cannot accept is the total lazy confusion of what happens around them.The idea is fine, that of a washed up rock star, Aldous Snow, whose career is to be rejuvenated by a 10th anniversary concert . Green is charged with the task of getting Snow from London to the Greek Theatre in LA. That provides a platform for the straight Hill to be subjected to rock n roll depravity by Brand, but the mix doesn't work. Hill is not written as a foil for Brand, instead he has equal status and the energy drains from the film with every camera shot of him.Record Company President Sergio Roma, played by Sean Combs,is a character with promise which is wrecked by overuse of profanity and one dimensional characterisation. Beyond that every stereotype, writing by numbers, and cliché supporting cast that you could ever have hallucinated about in your worst nightmares appears here.The DVD contains an alternative opening and finale, both of which are far superior to those which are on the final edit. In the theatre version a messy, ambiguous, video shoot for Snows latest single is presented as a potential trailer or promo and is highly irritating. The alternative conventional scene of a country house launch party with the video being screened and other characters introduced makes far more sense. Equally a tedious official finish at the inevitably successful concert is vastly inferior to a quite witty alternative . the many deleted and alternative scenes are testament to the fact that Stoller seriously lost the plot here.The music is uniformly bad, many scenes are superfluous and boring, and the clichés about a rock n roll lifestyle choke the life out of the story. How Stoller and co-writer Jason Segal could have so succeeded with ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" but failed so abjectly with this is a mystery. Although not the worst film I have ever seen, it is close run thing.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
A fun raunchy comedy that hits the mark,"I was lucky enough to see an advanced screening of this movie last week in Las Vegas and there was a short Q&A with Russel Brand and Jonah Hill after the screening.I would say this movie is a solid 7.5 out of 10, but that isn't really an option. The comedy in this movie lands well almost all of the time, and the story more or less takes a backseat to the comedy until the final 30 minutes or so.That is really the only part where the movie falls short. The story putters along adding more and more along the way, and the closing struggles to wrap it all up because it doesn't do anything to invest itself along the way. But the whole idea of the movie is to put the story in the backseat and have the audience enjoy the ride of the loosely stringed together jokes, and that is where it shines.T.J. Miller (notable from Cloverfield and She's Out of My League) has a fantastic turn as a concierge that Aaron has a short run-in with. Rose Byrne does a fantastic job of moderately offending you while making you laugh, and it is a definite departure from her past roles. There are plenty of fantastic cameos that serve their purpose to elevate the comedy to another level.By far, Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs steals the show as Sergio. The natural biased to accepting him as an actor dissolves by the time his first scene is over and you're too busy laughing to care anymore. The power of the comedy that was wrote for him overpowers your want for an actor you thought would be better suited for the role. It isn't until the hotel- chase sequence that you realize the casting was perfect for him.This film sets out to make you laugh and does exactly that in spades. The only qualms come from the story aspect, and when you're going to see a movie like this you shouldn't ever expect too terribly much from the story. ""Get Him to the Greek"" is extremely funny, easily watchable, and does its semi-source material (Forgetting Sarah Marshall) justice.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A laugh riot in spots,"Get Him to the Greek has moments of riotous hilarity, pockmarked with only a few scenes that try a little too hard to be effectively sentimental. The yin/yang chemistry between Russell Brand as a druggie rock star and Jonah Hill is believable and entertaining, and aside from the typical awkward nonslapstick scenes from writer Judd Apatow, the movie generally works.Aldous Snow (Brand), introduced in 2008's Forgetting Sarah Marshall, is now a washed-up rocker. He's been on the wagon, then off it. His band, Infant Sadness, hasn't played in ten years. Then a young record-company intern named Aaron Green (Hill) gets the idea of having the band reunite for a tenth anniversary show at the famed Greek Theater in Los Angeles. Aaron's high-octane boss Sergio (P. Diddy) instructs his charge to jet to London, gather up Snow and fly him to New York to be on the Today Show, then fly him to LA for the reunion show. Hilarity ensues.It actually does, too. Naturally, Aaron and Aldous are complete opposites – one a party-hardy hedonist and one more of a button-down, take-no-chances drip, one who has many brief encounters with the female kind and one who is just coming out of a long-term relationship. Or so he thinks, anyway. And as much as Aaron wants to get things moving along, Aldous wants to tarry and enjoy life a bit longer, sort of a microcosm of their individual lives up to that point.It's no surprise that each does a little bit of growing up along the way. But we're not meant to focus on that. Instead, Aaron and Aldous experience wacky escapades along the lines of Bachelor Party, with echoes of Pulp Fiction and The Hangover. What makes it all work is that it's not just one zany scene after another; director Nicholas Stoller tosses in some serious moments that are meant to humanize Aldous a bit more and take the edge off a little.The movie as a whole is effective in part because Brand is such a gifted comic who's made the Aldous Snow character his own. Brand as Snow electrifies the room when he walks in, sort of what you'd expect from a glamorous rocker. Even one who has some deep-seated issues of his own. See, the movie moves along pretty damn well when it's concentrating on the wackiness, with a smidge of seriousness thrown in, but when too much focus is diverted to those serious psychological issues, then it sort of crumbles. And it's not just issues with Aldous Snow, either; there are a few that try to work out Aaron's own problems (although for most of the movie he's befuddled and along for the ride, a well-meaning patsy).In particular, there is one scene near the end in which Aldous attempts to help Aaron and his girlfriend Daphne resolve their differences. Like with the more serious scenes in Forgetting Sarah Marshall – also directed by Stoller, and the movie to which this is sort of a sequel – the scene seems pointless and jarring. It's the opposite of what you, as viewer, want to see, as it's neither sexy nor funny nor illuminating.Another slight debit is P. Diddy. The man can play unhinged well, but he's not always funny here – sometimes he just comes off as a mean jerk. And not in the Mr. Dithers (boss of Dagwood Bumstead) way, either, not in the comically inept gangster way, just sort of sour and bitter. A little more work might help him, since I believe this was his first comedic attempt. And for a first attempt, it ain't bad.The bottom line is that Get Him to the Greek is really funny for a good portion of the film, with only a few dips into ill-advised sentimentality that just isn't effective and even helps kill the mood. Both Brand and Hill are well cast and are hysterical.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Jonah hill AGAIN, this is so annoying","is this fat A_ _ ever not in one of these stupid sexist movies? Lord help us, will he be in ALL of them playing the exact same character every time? These people that are in these type of movies on a regular basis cant act worth beans. Its like a camera man follows around the same pack of vulgar losers who cant control themselves and act like horny teenagers trying as hard as they can to offend as many people (especially women) in the process. Its a train wreck and paying money for this or to even see this is a total waste. I think people should instead donate money to these guys in the movies for acting school and to the directors for a psychotherapist to talk about their women issues. Cause they are clearly angry women haters who feel to the need to humiliate, degrade, and insult women on a constant basis and who have absolutely no respect for women nor their bodies. Degrading a person because of their sex or their body is not funny, its stupid and shows lack of character and immaturity. Can these directors seriously not make a movie without insulting women? are they incapable? Movies can be funny without belittling a sex. Where do they find these desperate women to take these roles anyway? Its truly sad. This movie is a disgrace and a waste of time.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

really a 6.5 on the IMDb scale almost good but not quite,"So I watched 2010's raunchy comedy ""get him to the Greek"". So was it good, I say ehh.. it started good. This film stars Russel Brand who I personally think is hilarious, especially when he appears on talk shows. He is an odd ex drug addict, who is sexy and looks like a rocker, so he is perfectly cast here. It also stars P-diddy as a record label owner a role he is well suited for. Additionally, it stars Jonah Hill who is very finny, and several supporting roles all done well. This movie starts awesome. It has sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll, all with raunchy humor and an interesting take on the classic road trip theme used by movies. However, the third act doesn't just feel weird and out of place it also feels awkward. The film comes back together by the final sequence, but by then I at least lost interest. This movie is geared more towards stoners, raunchy comedy fans, and the youth of this world. If you are not part of this demographic you will probably not care for this film much, and if you are, you may find yourself rolling on the floor in laughter until the third act when you may find yourself saying ""what?"". if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Don't even rent this movie, wait for it on TNT","This movie has a handful of funny parts and that's it. Nowhere near as good as Forgetting Sarah Marshall and doesn't make any genuine efforts to tie in the two movies at all. Diddy cannot act. Jonah Hill isn't funny at all in this film and Russell Brand is probably better served as a supporting actor because his comedic routine gets old very fast. The best role comes from Rose Byrne who unfortunately only spends about 15 minutes on screen, the interactions between her and Brand's character as the highlight of the movie and it probably would've been 10x more entertaining had they just focused the film strictly on the relationship of those two odd characters.If you enjoy overacting and simple punchlines, this movie will be right up your alley, otherwise do yourself a favor and save ten bucks.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"Very, Very Good Movie!","It doesn't take very long to realize this movie is written really, really well. Not only is the humor top notch (actually really funny), but the story and characters are written without flaw. Acting is superb. Russell Brand and Rose Byrne are about as good as it gets in a flick like this, and Jonah Hill gives one of the greatest performances of his career. The surprise actor in this movie is actually Sean Combs. He really nails his character as a record company exec and adds some nicely placed humor and counter-play to the fun Brand and Hill are having.As a musician myself, this movies really hits home several times. The relationship that evolves between Brand and Hill is true movie magic. Chemistry, writing and scenes all intermingle to create one of the best and funniest movies ever made. I highly recommend this movie.",,Anonymous,Music
I feel like I have seen this movie many times before.,"I have been a fan of Russell Brand for a while now, but not for his movies. This is actually my first film of his that I have seen. I got to know him from his various appearances on Letterman and Conan O'Brien. Anyway, I was excited to see one of his films finally. Jonah Hill plays a normal guy who works as an intern in the offices of a music business and gets the unwitting opportunity to pitch a concert idea to his boss (Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs), that involves bringing Russell's character back to the States for a concert in L.A. Unfortunately, the Director/Writer of the film picks a tired, overused character design in the guise of the typical drug-ridden, big-haired, British-1980s-like star who has seen better days and needs a come-back scenario that has been seen and heard time after time. The comedy unfolds methodically in the beginning, dishing out the laughs at a slow boil. Or, at least, it felt like that. The movie starts out slow in the beginning, gets going in the middle but crashes in the end. By the time you get to the end of the movie you do not like any of the characters and the message, although received is ignored because we have heard it a million times. Brand is very talented. He has a wonderful scene where he calls his ex-girlfriend and finally you begin to like this guy, but it is a little too late. Hill just seemed to be there, although he had his moments. Diddy steals the show. He has the most laughs but like everyone else in the movie you just want to punch him out. What we have here is a cute, funny, enjoyable attempt and a film worth seeing at least once, but overall it is repetitive and unoriginal. It felt like they needed to force the comedy out and needed a Herculean effort just to execute, even, the potty-humor.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Not a bad little comedy,"I watched this because I am a Jonah Hill fan and I think that this is the only film I've not seen yet with him in. And I had no idea on it and I enjoyed it.My main concern was Russell Brand. He slightly bugs me in real life so was curious from the get go on how he would be. And I liked him. I enjoyed the character arc that he was given and I thought he played it well and funny.
The plot I thought was good. Thought it went a bit downhill after the hour mark and the ending was just a bit meh. Wasn't a bad ending or anything it was just a bit dull.
A solid part of the story was based on the relationship between Jonah's character and his girlfriend. And to be honest it just never sucked me in. I wasn't arsed if they were together or not at the end.Overall though, it's a good comedy. Had some good laughs in there and it's a nice, funny way to kill an hour and a half.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
10/10 for puke,"Admittedly, 2 minutes into this movie I realised it was a mistake of mine to bring my mum with me to watch it on a lazy Saturday afternoon! Completely embarrassed from beginning to end and I didn't know where to look. Whoops!I was disappointed by this movie as from the trailers it looked like it would be a lot of fun, a bit rude at times but mainly a bit of a giggle. I was upset to see that quite a huge amount of the scenes I laughed at in the trailers weren't included in the movie itself which did give me the wrong impression of what it was going to be like.The swearing in the film was truly awful and no sentence was without an F-word or obscenity. The very rude sex scenes were completely unnecessary and again were a constant theme throughout the movie and added nothing to the actual storyline. I am absolutely not a prude at all and loved The Hangover last year and have seen the likes of Knocked Up and Forgetting Sarah Marshall and really enjoyed those movies but Get him to the Greek was really an excuse for Russell Brand just to be as filthy as possible and I didn't find it remotely funny.I found the movie to be endorsing and glamorising alcohol and drugs and I kept waiting for the moral message of ""this is the wrong way to live your life"" to come through and it really didn't until the last 2 seconds of the movie.I'm a girl so maybe this is more of a blokes film but definitely won't be recommending this to any of my friends.

Spectacularly Unfunny,"The movie opens with a music video from Russell Brand's rock star character that is laugh out loud funny. Sadly, save one other scene, that is the only time I actually laughed for the entire running time (which felt like three hours.) I snickered a little, I went hmmmm, I smiled a bit but as far as genuine gut-busters there were hardly any. As it wore on I started paying close attention to the audience (and this was 9pm on a Friday night, where many folks on first dates were desperate to latch on to a shared experience like, say, laughing together) and found they were behaving exactly as I. Scattered laughs from different parts of the theater, but no communal hilarity where the whole audience cracks up as one. The Apatow cash cow snuffed it on this one. Clearly the company is more focused on being prolific than funny and it shows.

A great modern comedy.,"As a spin-off of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, the movie uses many of the same characters, even if some of them appear only briefly, and the story focuses on one of the most interesting and entertaining of those characters, Aldous Snow (Russell Brand). Aldous Snow returns as the eccentric British rock star that is at times very wise and likable and at other times a complete douche.Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) works for Sergio Roma (Sean Combs), a soulless, money hungry music producer that gives Aaron the unenviable task of getting Aldous Snow sober enough to perform an anniversary concert that will revitalize his defunct music career. Aldous Snow is very uncooperative and his antics lead to a series of funny misadventures for both himself and poor Aaron Green. You really want to not like Aldous but there is something about him that is too charming to resist and you end up rooting for him to crawl out from the bottle/needle/pipe/pill bottle/etc. and get his life back on track.While Jonah Hill and Russel Brand are the stars of the movie, the supporting cast is also very entertaining and funny. Sean Combs is particularly amusing, as is the dysfunctional relationship between Aaron Green and his girlfriend Daphne Binks (Elisabeth Moss). Get Him to the Greek is a very lighthearted and entertaining comedy that I soon hope to own on DVD. If you liked Forgetting Sarah Marshal you will love this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Yes, I laughed but it is mostly a disappointment the Russell Brand/Jonah Hill stuff from ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" was funnier","It's been a while since I watched FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL (and a while since I don't write a IMDb comment). I recall watching it twice in less than four days it's, simply, a darn hilarious movie.A spin-off? Yes, here it is. I was really looking forward to watch GET HIM TO THE Greek, and a couple of days ago I ran across its R4 DVD (it was never released in theaters here in Mexico City). Well, I'm sure of two things: 1. Jonah Hill is gaining weight, as he is getting less and less funny (still he knows how to sing the Mars Volta!). 2. Russell Brand's Aldus Snow is a hilarious character that worked much better as a minor ""just for the fun"" one.As I remember, their stuff in ""Sarah Marshall"" delivered pretty much the greatest laughs of the movie (here Jonah Hill plays a completely different character tough). It was a simple situation: rock star dealing with a fan, (who is basically in love with him). Here we have a similar situation: same rock star dealing with a young man who works in the music business and who is also a huge fan. Laughs? Yes, we do have laughs, is pretty much inevitable having a guy like Brand (I would say ""like Hill"" too but like I said, he is losing it and certainly a not- just-for-the-fun part, the exact we have here, doesn't fit him extremely well) but the movie never really feels like something fresh, like something worthy. It's a movie to see only once, that's for sure. 6.5 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
It's all Greek to me.,"Everything in Get Him to the Greek gets carried over: Director Nicholas Stoller steals broken-down Brit rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) from Stoller's Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and producer Judd Apatow offers some homoerotic low jokes from Knocked Up with touches of bromance from The Hangover and I Love You, Man.Greek is not funnier by far than any of the recent male-bashing, chauvinistic romantic comedies, but it has moments of rock-star bashing and music industry mashing that save it from true crashing. Russell Brand's Snow is believably degenerate while displaying some wisdom about the world for the innocents abroad with him.Aaron Green (Jonah Hill), a greenhorn intern for a large music company, owned by Sergio Roma (a terrific Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs), is sent to London to bring back for a renewal concert bad-boy Snow in a concert at the Greek Theater in L.A. The mayhem has the usual wanton groupies, drugs in a scatological logistic new even for jaded bromance mongers, and throwing up that is just not pretty or important.Brand and P. Diddy save the movie from boredom, and the issue of doing what one loves gets some play both from rocker Snow and operative Aaron, whose medical intern girlfriend Daphne (Elisabeth Moss) wants to move for a residency to Seattle. The tension between her as an accomplished young professional and Aaron as a smitten Snow fan, and thus naïve, plays out as a credible argument during the narrative. Snow's attempt to reconnect with previous wife Jackie Q (Rose Byrn) is less believable again because the man seems so much less mature than the woman.That the attractive young Daphne could love the man/boy schlub Aaron is just one of many stretches that melodramatic bromance demands. Rock 'n Roll will survive as will Judd Apatow and immature men. I just hope Daphne becomes a doctor specializing in rock degeneracy. There's a future there.",,Anonymous,Music
Forgetting Aldous Snow,"Forgetting Sarah Marshall was a dull, unfunny comedy, in fact I would go as far to say that it wasn't comedy but a boring drama. It pains me every time i hear someone mention how brilliant it was, and I really can't comprehend why anyone commissioned a spin-off, on second thoughts scrap that, Forgetting Sarah Marshall made money at the box office, so of course we are going to get a lacklustre follow-up, none other than Get him to the Greek.The story follows Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) as he attempts to escort Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to his long overdue comeback gig but struggles to keep the dishevelled rock star away from drink, drugs and desperate women. It sounds like the perfect recipe for a comedy but unfortunately it appears that the writers created a number of key scenes and then attempted to loosely tie them together with a script, and that will never work.It's a shame that the majority of the jokes are clearly aimed at a teenage audience when references to The Mars Volta and Lars Ulrich clearly pay off, film-makers should realise that not everyone in the world is a hormonal teenage lad, desperate for a glimpse of nudity or endless toilet humour, but have faith that intelligent people are out there! Maybe they are just too on the ball and realise that anyone with half an ounce of intelligence will probably steer clear of this film. Admittedly, some of the jokes did bring a smile to my face, but this was not nearly enough to redeem the lack of structure and poor characterisation.If you like your films without meaning, easy to follow and easy to forget, go and watch Get Him to the Greek, the perfect throwaway Summer comedy.

Enough immoral and outrageous fun for a good time at the movies,"If the cliché ""sex, drugs and rock 'n roll"" has seemed obscured or irrelevant the last thirty years, it is no longer. ""Get Him to the Greek"" serves this unholy trinity buffet style. The latest Judd Apatow-produced laugh fest is a spin-off on the character Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) from 2008's ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" the licentious rock star with a drug addiction. How else, then, do you make a film about a walking stereotype other than expounding on the stereotypes? ""Greek"" suggests you roll with it, which is easy enough.There's not much of a story here, which limits what this movie can ultimately do, but there's just enough to get the ball rolling. Jonah Hill stars (in a role different than his ""Sarah Marshall"" character) as Aaron, an aspiring music producer working for millionaire music mogul (Sean ""P.Diddy"" Combs), who suggests they throw a 10-year anniversary concert featuring Snow's band Infant Sorrow at the Greek Theater, a move which could help the label and resurrect the sunken career of his favorite frontman.He is then charged with the responsibility of personally escorting Mr. Snow from London to the Today Show for a live appearance and performance and then to Los Angeles for the concert. Given Snow's reputation and bacchanalian tendencies, this task will prove much more difficult than the straight-laced Aaron could ever anticipate.What follows is the sex, drugs and rock 'n roll, but mostly drugs. About every scene involves at minimum the consumption of alcohol. If Aaron is not being tempted into it, he needs it to take the edge off because babysitting Snow is a painstaking endeavor. Producer/director Nicholas Stoller, understanding his film is both literally and figuratively laced with substance abuse, doesn't treat it like a physical gag that needs building up to like every other film with a clichéd ""drug scene."" He uses quick sequences with rapid-fire shots that while seemingly rushed at the time, get the point across without calling any more attention to it than the film already does. This is of course with the exception of the climactic drug scene toward the end when it all hits the fan.Comedian Brand actually plays Snow with unexpected dignity in this film. Here's the potential to just go batty and ridiculous, but Brand tastefully realizes that this is part of Snow's make up; he doesn't need to externalize it with raucous and stumbling behavior. There's also a very human element to the story as we learn Snow's behavior is largely tied to his split from longtime girlfriend and the mother of his children, Jackie Q (Rose Byrne).Then again, the sentimental aspect weakens ""Greek"" in terms of its lasting impression. It's a bit unrealistic to expect that a film basking in loose morals could possibly have morals of its own and convey them with legitimacy. Aaron too has a love sub plot: his long-term girlfriend (""Mad Men's"" Elisabeth Moss) and he get in a fight right before he leaves for London. Stoller admirably hopes to touch the heart as well as the funny bone by keeping these threads going throughout the adventure, but it keeps ""Greek"" from building into the comedic hurricane its ""less plot, more fun"" premise suggests (and many fans were likely expecting).As outrageous as ""Get Him to the Greek"" behaves at times, it will manage to bring just about anyone with a raunchy sense of humor aboard for its shameless and sinful ride. Even Diddy has his moments in a cast of solid characters whose stories might be weak, but performances reflect the underlying maturity that Apatow films have been known for in spite of the boundary-pushing sex and drugs humor.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Forgetting Sarah Marshall fans beware!!!!,"Really this movie should be getting an 0 rating.

I didn't connect with any of the characters, both Russell Brand and Jonah Hill reprised the tired roles they've played in previous films (and yes I know that this movie is a spin off of the vastly superior ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""). I know that in it's own way the movie is a satire about the music industry and rock and roll icons, but if Jason Segel and Nicholas Stoller wanted to to make this movie, maybe the should've just written it as a drama and not a comedy.

Greek is not the word! Even though at times it was diddy good.,"The sidesplitting and sharp comedy ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" is one flick I have not forgotten about. So I was all psyched on seeing ""Get Him to the Greek"" which is from the same director behind the Marshall plan; that being Nicholas Stoller. Well unfortunately it looks like Stoller has stolen 109 minutes from my existence, because ""Get Him to the Greek"" was an enormous disappointment. The Greek film stars Russell Brand as Aldous Snow of the band Infant Sorrow, who would be the same uproarious rock star character he played in a supporting role in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". Also in the Greek starring show is Marshall alumni Jonah Hill portraying Aaron Green, a record company assistant who is given the challenging task of accompanying (or more like babysitting) the out-of-control Snow from London to Los Angeles' Greek Theater for a scheduled Infant Sorrow comeback concert. Ruckus follows consistently as a neurotic Aaron does his best to control the alcohol & drug induced Snow on the ride from London (with pit stops in New York & Las Vegas) to the Greek, but to no avail. Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs co-stars as the demanding record executive Sergio Roma who delegated the ""snowjob"" to Green. Rose Byrne plays Jackie Q., Snow's sexy pop star ex-girlfriend who shares a child with Snow, but now is Entering Sandman every night by mating with Lars Ulrich of Metallica. Elisabeth Moss also co-stars as Daphne, Green's longtime girlfriend who is more on the Daphne Duck side in the looks department. The movie does contain some gross-out comical scenes that provide a few chuckles but they wear out their welcome already during the film's second act. Brand was a riot in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" but his branded ""highwire"" rock star personification is not fit to lead a film. Hill's tiresome bit as the starstruck but determined assistant Green also started growing weary early in getting to the Greek. However, I do not fault Brand and Hill completely. They both got a raw deal by Stoller getting them a muddled & disconnected screenplay. The one thing that really rocked in ""Get Him to the Greek"" was the scene-stealing performance from Sean ""P. Diddy"" Combs as the self-centered but charismatic Roma. The movie worked when it was in Roma. To say that ""Get Him to the Greek"" is a forgettable movie is definitely not part of Greek Mythology, it is a fact! What a Greek tragedy! *** Average",6.0,Anonymous,Music
not awesome.,"Wow. this is my first review, and I was inspired to write it because I felt like the amount of good reviews on here are not representative of the quality (or lack there of) of the film. I am really really surprised at the amount of good reviews on here. I suppose if you are a big fan of Russell Brands humor that would help. I am not. While I still thought forgetting Sarah Marshall was funny, Aldous Snow, ( Brand's character) was not my favorite part at all..so maybe I have should have known better. Regardless, while the movie opens up in a promising way, with an almost funny mock music video of Brand's character entitled African Child--the movie seems thrown together, unbelievable and unoriginal, (for example, the over the top mock music video of Brand's pop singer ex-lover has been done before exactly in ""Music and Lyrics""), and it was overall far too long and just not funny to me, my friends, and apparently the entire theatre, judging from the awkward silence. While i'm all for goofy Apatow comedies and the like, I wouldn't want anyone to waste their time on this one. Unless you love Russell Brand. Then you'll probably like it.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Constant chuckling and the occasional belly laugh are on offer.,"Russell Brand is charismatic. No two ways about it. He oozes an effortless charm that sucks you in whether you like it or not. Which is lucky, because his Aldous Snow is completely unlikeable for the most part and is only palatable thanks to Brand's aforementioned qualities. His nonchalant approach towards what other people think and his egotistical attitude – in real life that is – suits the portrayal of a rock star perfectly, to the extent that it's extremely difficult to ascertain whether this is life imitating art or vice-versa, such are the similarities between actor and character.However for Brand's ying there is Jonah Hill's yang. Polar opposites in just about every way, Hill provides the ideal counterbalance to the brash British comedian. He is subdued, straight-faced and subtle – the adrenaline shot sequence being an exception – but just as funny, if not more. Where Brand relies on outspoken brazenness for laughs, the chubby American elicits humour with measured wit and authentic comic timing, as evidenced by his superb comebacks throughout the film.With the brilliant chemistry between its differing leads and the surprisingly terrific support by the usually dramatic co-stars – Combs is hilarious whilst Byrne and Meaney are in roles you would never expect to see them in – you would think GHTTG is a sure-fire hit, and it looks that way for the first 75 minutes. Unfortunately it begins to fall to pieces come the final act when writer-director Stoller opts to take a serious route and deliver a clichéd moral point rather than sticking with the unabashed entertainment of the first two acts. This serious misstep in tone finishes the movie on a low and undoes some of the good work that proceeded it, though not enough to dampen the overall experience.Constant chuckling and the occasional belly laugh are on offer in this solid, if ultimately forgettable, comedy.3 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Like seriously!,"I don't get it.Did a bunch of people actually agree to spend money and time and effort on this putrid pile of excreta without having their kids and pet dogs held at gun-point? I'm disturbed at the amount of good reviews this movie is generating. Do people really find scenes where a character is forced to shove a packet of drugs up his rectum (in an airport security line no less!) and then is forced to expel it out again- funny? Seriously? Like. Really? This could have been tear-your-eyes-out funny (c'mon! you had Russel Brand to play with!), but the film-makers don't know when to quit being crass and excessively OTT with racist, sexist, juvenile humor. And who the heck okayed Sean Diddy for ANY role, he can't act much less be comedic! I wanted to slap him silly every time he came on screen and masticated his lines. Come to think of it, I wanted to slap everyone silly for wasting 109 minutes of my life! Note to Jonah Hill- Just being fat isn't funny. For the love of Gawd, go on a diet and invest in a treadmill and make a movie of that. I guarantee it will be a huge success.The ONLY redeeming part were the songs. Sad, right? But I actually found them funnier and quite original than this entire depressing premise.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
"Almost, but not quite what I was expecting","Going into this movie I was expecting a fun comedy movie, Russell Brand was going to be the stand out cast member and there was going to be tons of swearing and sexual innuendo. I was not disappointed.If you are after the above then go see this movie but be warned, this is not all about laughs. I had spoken to a friend who saw this before me who told me that she was quite concerned with the over the top drug use portrayed in the movie. For me this didn't concern me in the slightest as in some of the scenes it really did enhance the comedy.The problem is that the writers of the script tried very hard to push an anti-drug message throughout the movie, for which I have massive respect. The problem was the timing of the delivery of this message. In a lot of scenes you have just wet yourself laughing (at drug use), to be promptly smacked in the face with the anti-drug message.This left me feeling a little guilty for laughing to be honest.Mind you, I haven't laughed this hard in the cinema since I saw The Hangover so it wasn't doing many things wrong.Despite all of this I would suggest waiting for the DVD.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Well I hope you're wearing a condom cause I have a dirty mind.,"If you watched ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" you will make the connection. Aldous Snow was a character in that film. Russell Brand does a pretty good job in playing him. He's offensive, vulgar and obnoxious at times. Jonah Hill played a different character where he goes to London, England to collect Aldous Snow and bring him to Los Angeles at the Greek Theatre. It's harder than it sounds. Along the way, they stopped in New York and Las Vegas before making it in time to a sell out concert. It's not a bad film but not one of my favorites.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Get me to the greatness of the Greek - Again!,"After 2008's quirky romcom Forgetting Sarah Marshall – arguably that years' best giggle wiggle, I was surprised to see that there was going to be a sequel, even if it was indirect, because: a) Sequels rarely work and b) Why ruin what was so enjoyable about the first? It's like if they did 'The 50 Year Old Virgin', it would completely make people reluctant to ever watch Steve Carell again, though Evan Almighty did a good enough job of that.But here in all its Russell Brandness is a sequel that almost is as good as the first. Hallelujah! This time round instead of Jason Segel being our leading lad, its Russell Brand playing a British rock version of himself, who is being taken from London to L.A. within 72 hours via Aaron Green (Jonah Hill). This however is apparently considered an impossibility and after seeing 0.25 seconds of Aldous Snow, it isn't hard to see why.If you hate Russell Brand this really isn't for you (Duh?). Everything from his Edward Scissor Hands hairdo to his teenage libido is at an all-time high for 99% of the film, the other 1% being the credits. Hence it is unsurprising why many consider this the visual/audio version of his 'My Booky Wook'. Personally I love dear Russell, to the point of wanting to dip him in my coffee and put sprinkles all over his head.Russell along with Jonah Hill and P.Diddy make a threesome that is a delightfully humorous combination, like a modern day 'Apatow' version of the three wise men. On the topic of threesomes, that word will never have the same pleasurable meaning again after seeing Get Him to the Greek - just stay away from a horny Jonah Hill, that's all I'm saying.Out of all the whole grain goodness of the film - sorry about that, I forgot it wasn't a cereal, the Las Vegas scene is quite easily the most funny. It has the kind of mayhem you'd expect to have happened during the drunkenness of The Hangover. There is also a scene within that of an adrenaline shot which compared to the heart stopping nervousness of Pulp Fictions' certainly isn't the counterpart.Admittedly Forgetting Sarah Marshall is marginally funnier, but that doesn't mean if there was a threequel I would at all be hesitant to watch it. My bets on it being Kristen Bell and her cheesy in-film television shows – but I'd much rather have them call it a day than risk another spin-off.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Horrible, sexist, degrading, uncreative","and yet AGAIN, the exact same characters. I am getting so sick of seeing the same half dozen or so people in all these raunch comedies. I need to stop going to these judd apatow type movies.

(how original) they did that in the last 10 movies that were exactly like this. yawn. Immature, raunchy, and just plain pathetic. Cant people think of something different? I cant believe these losers are getting so much hype and making millions off of making degrading crap like this and people are liking it. Its scary to me. The writer and director had no imagination.

"very funny, especially Sean Combs","Russell Brand was quite amusing in Forgetting Sarah Marshall playing a pretentious yet rather likable rock star. Brand's character might seem like something that would work best in small doses, but he works surprisingly well as a major character in this crazier take on the My Favorite Year theme of a nice boy who has to babysit a famous lunatic.Produced by Judd Apatow, this movie could be seen as a commentary on the guy's wish fulfillment theme of so many of his films. Here we have a nebbish who gets to lead the life of a rock star, but this is not portrayed as a good thing, making it more of a be-careful-what-you-wish for theme.Brand is very funny in this film (and in the end proves he'd make a pretty good rock star), but it is Sean Combs who supplies the biggest laughs with a take-no-prisoners performance as a music studio head.Brand's peculiar charisma and the movie's frenetic pace work well, and over all I enjoyed this movie a bit more than Forgetting Sarah Marshall.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Some cheap (but big) laughs,"The first and most important thing about this film is you cannot go into it expecting the world. If you hope for a groundbreaking new comedy to top all others then this isn't for you.

I must offer a word of caution though, if you are easily offended in any way then you may find this... distasteful shall we say. Watch it with a light heart and an open mind and you will find this all part of the charm though and you will find yourself watching a very respectable and amusing comedy, it will not be a disappointment.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Get Him to the Greek (2010) - African Child Sucks! Aldous Snow Rules!,"Do you remember the movie, ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall""? Remember, the guy from that movie, played by Russell Brand? He portrayed a fictional rock star named Aldous Snow. Yeah, I like that guy. Guess what, he has his own movie called ""Get Him to the Greek"", with Jonah Hill and P. Diddy. Yeah, the movie is about Jonah Hill who helps Aldous get his career back, and send him to the Greek Theatre in L.A. for his 10th anniversary concert. Yeah, and throughout the trip, they get into some drunken chaos. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Anyways, back to my reality voice. ""Get Him to the Greek"" was actually a super funny movie, and it was fun to see Russell Brand's hilarious character again after so long since ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". I think this movie really shows the spin-off back-plot of the character, explaining to us more about this particular character. And Jonah Hill was also pretty funny, and he has his moments. Both Brand and Hill create a good and hilarious chemistry together, and I couldn't resist. But P-Diddy's performance was about to be ""off-the-roof"" funny, until he starts to get annoying later on. And Nicholas Stoller and Judd Apatow returned to make more laughs, and make them bigger than the laughs I made when watching ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"". You know what, they did just that. They just blew the roof off this movie, and made the Aldous Snow character more raunchy and more funny. Now, let me just say, this well-written, raunchy, off-the-roof movie is like watching a sequel to Sarah Marshall, only I would call it: ""Forgetting Aldous Snow"". Now, where was I? Oh, yes! ""Get Him to the Greek"", in my review, ""rocking funny, and a perfect piece of character"".",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Amusing but underwhelming - relies too much on the personalities of the leads.,"It took a while but I eventually got around to watching this. (Thanks Hoyts discount offer!) Russell Brand was hardly the best thing about Forgetting Sarah Marshall a couple years ago, that film is a little underrated and had several memorable scenes and roles, not least of which was surprisingly Paul Rudd.But Rusty was the guy though that did the most with his sudden emergence, since that time he has been a staple on the late night talk shows, continued releasing his stand up comedy DVDs despite the fact that they have no jokes and are basically him telling stories with his humorous cadence and patois, and managed to nab the music ""It-Girl"" of the moment Katy Perry. (Oh and Russell, as far as having a unique way of speaking, that worked for Pauly Shore. For a while.) Coupled with the fact that I believe Russell Brand to be quite a smart bloke (apart from the Katy Perry thing) and I hope he makes the most of his 15 minutes because he can be quite funny and often inspired to laugh inducing rambling rants, (my favourite type of rants by the way).So rather than come up with a new vehicle to maximise Brand's ""brand"" they smartly stick with what got him there in the first place, the rock star Aldous Snow, lead singer of Infant Sorrow.In Forgetting Sarah Marshall Aldous Snow was merely the guy who took Peter's titular missus. During the film Snow sang two songs and showed that he was capable of great rock star excess, but he rarely gave too much direct evidence of how capable.In Get him to the Greek he gets his shot.It is a few years on from the Hawaiian soujourn and Snow's high flying career is abruptly grounded. An ill conceived song and album both titled African Child is universally panned by critics and even his loyal fans, and his longstanding, similarly smutty missus Jackie Q (Rose Byrne) has ditched him, taking their son with her. Aldous has as a result fallen off the teetotalling wagon big time and is hoovering up everything he can push into an orifice.Snow is left to revel in his own depression with only toadying henchmen and his Mum (with who he has a love/hate relationship) sticking around. For some reason, cinematic convenience perhaps? Snow travels sans entourage for the entire film.Back in the States a low level music exec Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) is sitting in a company brainstorming session, he floats the idea of Infant Sorrow reforming to play a 10 year anniversary gig in LA at the famed Greek theatre, the site of Snow's greatest success. Aaron's boss the Les Grossman rip-off named Sergio (Diddy... as in Diddy) is unimpressed, but looks into it. Imagine Aaron's surprise when Sergio returns days later to inform him that Snow has agreed to the gig, and that Aaron is to almost immediately set off to chaperone him to America for a promo TV appearance and the concert.Aaron is a longtime devotee of Infant Sorrow's and heads home to tell his overworked missus Daphne of his success. Daphne is not a big music lover unfortunately, what with her career as a doctor taking shape and all, and after a brief argument they agree to break up.So Aaron, simultaneously heartbroken and breathless with anticipation heads off to run his taxi-service. As with all major musical gigs apparently the planning and implementation of the entire proposal can be done in no time... Aaron has three days.Look I could go through the next hour of the film describing misadventures and hijinks, we all know going in that this would be more ""Sex & Drugs & Rock'n'Roll"" than ""Wine, Women & Song"", and it is, that's why it is a bit odd that all the goings on left be more bemused than amused.Sure Aldous gets himself in many a predicament with his spoiled ""I do what I want"" attitude, and manages to drag Aaron into most proceedings despite his weak protests, but the whole thing is more matter-of-fact than shocking or hilarious.Missed flights, absinthe, casual groupie encounters and botched interviews all come and go, but the only scene that raised the eyebrows was when Aldous demands that Aaron hide his stash as they go through customs... join the dots from there kids.Will Snow get to the gig? Will Aaron get back with Daphne? Will Diddy ever be anything less than a self-absorbed prat? I'd like to say that the whole thing was as I expected and feel pretty smug about myself that this wouldn't stand up well against the original film. Going in I thought there'd be some debauchery featuring drugs and women and hopefully more Brand than Hill, that all happened, but I did fully expect that this would make me laugh a lot more than it did.All that and the fact that Diddy just can't make himself seem memorable, attention grabbing or as cool as he has always seemed to think he is, even when his role is practically written that way.Final Rating - 6 / 10. Amusing at times, worth a look. Why do I feel strangely empty? Definitely a film I will revisit on DVD to see if I think differently next time round.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

The Vidiot Reviews...,"Get Him to the GreekBeing a rock star's assistant is awesome – not only do you get to see every concert for free, but you also get to wring out their sweaty leather pants after a 2-hour performance under hot stage lights.Unfortunately, the Pinnacle Records talent scout in this comedy doesn't get that opportunity; instead he must cope with a rocker's personal issues.Ordered by his boss (Sean Combs) to fly to England and escort singer Aldo Snow (Russell Brand) to L.A. for a comeback concert, Aaron (Jonah Hill) puts his relationship and well-being on the line to work for his drug-addled idol.A gross-out dark comedy that lacks the laughs to really lampoon the music industry, Get Him to the Greek does possess enough pathos to manipulate viewers into enjoying it.Nevertheless, if Aldo wants to be musically relevant again, he needs to perform a duet with Justin Bieber, dressed as Lady Gaga.

why is rape seen as funny,"This movie is hilarious. Lots of great lines, great acting, even the story line is entertaining. I'm not sure if this is a spoiler.

It isn't funny just because it's a bit unusual. It really is always unacceptable.I am sad, because I was a big fan of Russell Brandt and was absolutely loving this film until that point.

A definite must see!,"A small cast but a stellar one and it didn't just rely on sick humour to get you through the 120 minutes. I was quite peeved because the film times for Wednesday (orange Wednesday baby) are a bit rubbish and I feared I'd be pining for my bed after about an hour. It was not just funny but cleverly hilarious. For those of you who have seen Forgetting Sarah Marshall you will know that this is a spin off about the character Aldous Snow played by Russell Brand. Jonah Hill plays Aaron Green, a young record company exec who is entrusted by his manager (P Diddy) to fly to London and ensure Snow makes it in time for the 10 year anniversary concern at the Greek Theatre in LA. A move to make millions for the record company and revive Snow's flagging career. What ensues is a not so tedious but hilarious battle to get Aldous to where he needs to be whist enjoying a 'Jeffrey', some furry wall stroking, late night partying (including a cameo from a certain Harry Potter villain), plane hopping and even a few poignant moments where you see a bit more to the troubled rock star. It's not a complicated plot and doesn't require you to think very hard but that's not the aim here. The film makes for a great night out and judging by the roars of laughter emanating from the audience it's safe to say other people are of the same opinion.Brand is excellent once again as the debauched character but is most definitely not the only reason to watch. Jonah Hill is as funny and awkward as ever and the two make a great double act as the straight and funny comedy act . P Diddy for me is shining star here, I wasn't aware of his great comic timing and the script writers quite rightly gave him some stonking one liners which were delivered with gusto.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
My 340th Review: It's only rock'n'roll - hit & miss comedy that tries to sum up the madness of the music industry,"GHTTG is in no way the funniest film I've seen this year or the smartest - it's crude, rude, filled with sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll, but it does have a couple of good performances that grow on you as the film progresses - however, it is saved by the fact that it is one of a handful of films that actually tries to be about the music industry and it's complete madness.Solidly made there's lots to both and like and dislike here, it's pretty hit and miss, but if you've ever moshed in a pit, been covered in mud at a festival, been stoned and laughed like a drain then you'll understand this film 100%. If you're idea of rock'n'roll is that you're too old to like new music then you're not going to ever enjoy this.A tale of excess and excessive excess at that all wrapped in memorable oneliners it's just way too lightweight to score more than a 6 but it is offensive, crude, funny, self-deprecating, and by the end there is something of a journey - and that's what 's it all about.If you like Apatow comedies and a genuine satire on rock'n'roll then GHTTG will fascinate - just don't expect it to hit more than 50% of the time - it's a weird film with OTT performances that makes good mainstream comedy - go figure....",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Want to sing 'hairyoke' ?,"I was sort of skeptic about this movie, not really sure what to expect of it. I thought it was going to be just another mediocre comedy that would be seen and then forgotten all about.

And the way the story was presented and told was really good.The cast in the movie was just amazing, especially Russell Brand in the role as Aldous Snow.

An Unexpected Comic Pairing Brings Laughs and Surprising Resonance to an Apatow Factory Farce,"There are moments that are laugh-out-loud riotous and there are others that are purely head-scratching, but the net effect of this raunchy, often clever 2010 anti-buddy comedy directed by Nicholas Stoller is genuinely positive. This is his second feature after 2008's ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"", which served as the introduction to Russell Brand's character, Aldous Snow, a sexed-up, heroin-abusing, non-sequitur-spouting British rock star. In this screenplay co-written by Stoller and Jason Segel (who also co-wrote and starred in ""Sarah Marshall""), Aldous has been on the skids since the release of a publicly reviled album called ""African Child"" - denounced as the worst thing to happen to Africa since apartheid.What's worse is that Spice Girls-inspired pop star Jackie Q, his longtime girlfriend and mother of his child Naples, has left him for Lars Ulrich, the longtime drummer for Metallica. Meanwhile, Sergio Roma, a megalomaniacal label executive, is about to release Aldous from his contract when puppyish young staffer Aaron Green comes up with the high-risk idea of a comeback concert in LA, marking the 10th anniversary of Aldous' landmark show at the Greek Theater. The rest of the story is a ""Hangover""-type road movie of sorts between Aaron and Aldous, as Aaron has to fetch the rock star in London and get him to LA in time for the concert three days away. Predictably, nothing goes as planned as Aaron, in the throes of a sudden break-up with his overworked hospital intern girlfriend Daphne, gets seduced by Aldous' narcissistic excesses.What becomes less predictable is how Stoller and Segel choose to deepen Aldous enough to give the character a sense of introspection about his besotted life, including a side trip to Vegas where he reunites with his estranged father, a guitarist for a Rat Pack tribute show who is jealous of his son's success. At the same time, Roma is in hot pursuit to make sure Aaron does his job, and everyone gets involved in a drug-fueled mêlée that should serve as the definitive anti-drug commercial. Brand completely stole ""Sarah Marshall"" from his cast mates, including Kirsten Bell, who played the title role and shows up in an unexpected cameo. Given this is a vehicle for his character, he manages to show more dimension to Aldous without losing sight of his hilarious comic creation (his opening video is hysterically tasteless). In a comparatively more constrained role, Jonah Hill manages to be regular-guy funny and brings surprising heart to put-upon Aaron.Together Brand and Hill convey a convincing sense of trust between the characters despite their opposite tendencies. On the sidelines, Rose Byrne shows real comic chops as the uninhibited Jackie Q, while Elisabeth Moss of ""Mad Men"" makes Daphne far more than the wet rag she is set up to be in the story. Colm Meaney effectively plays Aldous' embittered father during the film's most serious scene, while Sean Combs is quite funny - in a good way - as Roma. It should come as no surprise that this whole venture was produced by Judd Apatow since his fingerprints are everywhere given all the comic and often crass male bonding throughout. Stoller's uneven direction explains the fluctuating variations in the movie's tone, and like every Apatow movie, the film runs about twenty minutes too long for the slight story being told. Brand and Hill, however, make an engaging duo no matter what.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Bangers and mash, this is trash","This film is an absolute abomination. I watched it about 18 months ago and my feelings haven't yet mellowed. Brand plays a drug-addled bad-boy rock star thrown a lifeline by Combs who agrees to promote his tour, but only if the comparatively conservative Hill (whose idea it was to resurrect Brand's career) can successfully bring him half way round the world to close the deal. In my opinion, it's not necessarily the story that's mundane or just plain useless, but the miscasting.Jonah Hill isn't nearly ""mature"" looking enough to pull-off his world-weary music industry marketing exec, a man-child whose apparent knowledge and appreciation of grass roots rock belies his meagre age. He displays a resigned grief at the commercialisation of rock'n'roll, but it's the dialogue of an older actor, and Hill just doesn't look convincing. Even his live-in girlfriend, a medical intern (Moss) looks old enough to be his aunt (or his mother perhaps but I don't want to go there). Some reviewers have lauded Sean Combs' foul-mouthed music promoter as deft casting, but in my opinion, he comes off looking self-indulgent. As for Russell's brand, his celebrity status is so inescapable that any attempt at playing a ""character"" (arguable as to whether he's more or less playing himself here) fails miserably.The lyrics to Brand's satirical songs could have been a coup, but they too are gratuitous and self-aware. More subtlety and less canned laughter was sorely needed to float this boat, and in the end, it, like its drug-fuelled fictitious star, drowns spectacularly in its own slick puddle of sick.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

And they totally sell it as a comedy, which they do with all Apatow movies and I don't know why. Forgetting Sarah Marshall to me was barely a comedy because it's about a guy who is depressed the whole time. This isn't really that different. Just in this case it's a drug addict rock star who is pretty much headed on the road that many people have taken in recent years and ended up as a breaking news obit at the top of this website. It's another bromance as well, which is fine by me. All these movies are more sentimental than they'd have you believe in the trailers. I personally think that's detrimental to the movie because it makes people expect one thing and get another and then write on the internet how disappointed they are. Problem is, it's not a bad movie. It's actually a good movie about the record industry and people and how they treat each other in such a ridiculous lifestyle with some funny bits thrown in.I love Russell Brand and Jonah Hill together. I think they have the best chemistry. Their scenes together, pretty much the whole film, were more personal than funny. The more comedic parts usually happen when other people enter the mix. P. Diddy, for example, had a much larger role than I expected and he was okay in it. I probably would have cast an actor with more comedy experience, as well as choosing a different rock star cameo for Jackie Q's other love interest. But apart from that I really have no complaints. Perhaps I would have used more of Aldous' songs throughout the film, but that's because I quite like Brand's voice. I don't know that it was necessary for the plot.Other stuff. It's an R for a reason. There's sex humor and drug stuff going on. There are some breasts but not much else in the nudity dept. that I can recall. I guess I'd recommend it for people like me who like English rock stars and comedies with warm fuzzies.Evren Buyruk",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Disappointing,"Disappointing. Started off incredibly well - screamingly funny, and a good parody of the music industry. Then about halfway through, it just suddenly hit a wall, running out of ideas, and anything funny to say.If the music industry parody could have been maintained at the same level of intensity and humour as in the first half, this would have been a great movie. The edginess just seemed to disappear after a while, plus the writer and director seemed to think the movie was a drama, delving into some rather half-baked takes on relationships.Russell Brand is great in the lead role, playing a character that was tailor-made for his rock star-like personality and appearance. Jonah Hill is weak and irritating as the sidekick. The surprise performance comes from Sean ""Puff Daddy"" Combs as the intense record exec. He is amazingly good, and almost steals the show from Russell Brand.Watch the first 40 minutes or so, and save yourself some time by skipping the rest.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
So little laughs made it seem so long,"The main problem is the main character, he's just not funny at all. I had seen him in other movies as a random sideshow and sometimes he's slightly funny in those cases but still more corny than anything.Oddly enough Kanye West or P diddy or whoever that was did provide some laughs. I can't tell them apart because they both do the same dumb things to try and act cool (like wearing sunglasses indoors at night). But he was funny and did a good job acting hypertensive and crazy.Jonah Hill is normally a really funny guy when given the right role, but in this case he has to try to make something off his interactions with the main character which is hard to do when Russel Brand just brings nothing to the movie for him to work with. It wasn't a good role for Jonah Hill.The movie does have quite a few cameos that I guess they hoped would engage the viewers more, but I was so annoyed and disappointed by the lack of comedy that I just didn't care.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Can't Say I 'Get' It,"Maybe there's something that I'm just completely missing, or maybe it's just me, but I really do not see what is so great about these movies. And I'm talking about the (mainly) Judd Apatow batch of films that just seem to be all about dropping the f-bomb every other word, doing drugs, excessive drinking, and constant sex. I just don't find them funny, and yes, you are going to crucify me, but I'm talking about 'The Hangover,' 'Pineapple Express,' and all those sorts of films. I don't find people getting wasted, or stoned funny. Needless to say, I did not like 'Get Him To Greek.' It was just another blur of cussing, sex, drugs, and drinking, with a half-hearted and vague moral thrown in there just to save face. Something about monogamy and sobriety tucked into the last couple minutes that I could tell the producers didn't believe but just inserted so they wouldn't be criticized for their promotion of these reckless behaviors.But I seem to be the only one on this boat. People were in hysterics in the theater while I sat there in disgust, so if you like this sort of profane movie it's probably genius. You should go see it. But if you're anyone who doesn't promote the lifestyle of a junkie, constantly-hammered half-wit then stay away.Oh, and half of the scenes in the commercials seemed to be cut out of the movie. Just to let you know.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Ummm.. was this the SAME character?,"I REALLY wanted to like this movie. honestly.. I LOVED the Snow character in ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" and his weird brand of insanity.. really plugged into the movie. Unfortunately what worked in that film.. can't really sustain for a TWO hour film.Jonah Hill returns. as a new character.. And.. I don't dislike Hill as some do. But he really didn't' add anything to the proceedings.. and as the film moves along. it feels more like MOMENTS that work well enough on their own.. but as en entire film, it never really ties together.And as you clip along into the third act.. Snow finds his ""rock and roll life"" empty.. And what was with putting Rose Byrne in the movie? She had some funny lines.. but yet again, didn't add too much to the film over all. If anything.. the relationship between Aldous and his ""son"" is what should have been explored.. sadly the same with his father (while some funny moments... nothing really felt resolved, as you'd think.But. that's the REAL problem here. with Aldous being the CRAZY and loopy rock star.. part of what worked in his earlier role.. is that everyone around him was kind of normal. and you even identified with SOME of the characters. You don't here really.. and the movie jumps from being ""guy being smacked in the face/head"" to this.. kind of slightly serious third act.Sean Combs? I have nothing against him or his music (not my taste). But it seemed like they thought the foul mouthed Tom Cruise character from ""Tropic Thunder"" was a good idea.. but let's let P. Diddy drop the bombs. he really has no impact as a character.. and he has no real presence in the film as a whole either.The movie had.. at the first minute a confusing opening.. but then again.. it makes sense giving the ""music video"" in Marshall.. But..I don't hate the film totally.. there were a few laughs.. Carla Gallo shows up as a stripped named Destiny.. is a real stand out BIT for the film.. in the whole over the top level as they go. but.. it never felt they were poking FUN at the rock star life, as you'd hope.. and they never really make much of a notice of how miserable, really, that it makes Aldous to have to live it..This is by far to me the WEAKEST Apatow entry.. It scores just below ""Funny Peope"" (can't comment on ""Drillbit Taylor"".. so I won't). Unlike ""Funny People"" which may not have been GREAT.. it did tie together quite well.This is a real disappointment on ALL levels.. from the director, Stoeller who did a great job with Marshall just felt FLAT and confined here.. the casting was OK.. but the characters were so transparently THIN and really unlikable or unrelatable (Adam Green and his girlfriend being the two worst in this area).There are some THEMES that.. it would have been GREAT to explore.. the whole idea of Aldous finding his LOVE of performing again.. deciding the rock star life wasn't for him.. or the fact that record managers are A lot of the problem telling people what they WANT to hear.. rather than what they NEED to hear.. all great things that MIGHT have given.. something to this film..but, as I said.. there are IDEAS thrown out there.. and I did like the BRIEF callback to Sarah Marshall.. it tied the worlds together. But over all.. its not a film that's either fall out funny.. and not a film you can identify with the characters (I couldn't anyway). So it fell as a rather sharp disappointment. I was quite looking forward to it. The character had such great potential, and the idea of a film pointing out the flaws and foibles behind the music industry could have been GREAT fodder for the film. As it stands the episode of South Park about illegal downloads really does have more depth than this film. unfortunate.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Smart, silly, endearing laugh fest","I've recently watched and reviewed actor Jonah Hill's directorial debut in his coming of age skatepark drama ""mid90s"" which impressed me, so I wanted to check out his other work. I haven't seen Jonah Hill in a lead role before, and neither Russell Brand who I was also impressed by in his voice acting role in ""Trolls."" I was excited to see these two leads together in one film because I think they are funny, intelligent actors who normally get more sidekick, supporting roles. Dunno why I haven't heard about ""Get Him to the Greek"" (2010) before here in 2019, but I am glad to see it featured in HBO's Amazon Prime channel because it is a fantastic comedy that had me and my sister laughing.""Get Him to the Greek"" has kind of a diabolical ""South Park"" bent, especially with the antics of Russell Brand's character and his spoof ""African Child"" music video which opens the film. I love ""South Park,"" I enjoyed this film. There's a similar satire, self-awareness, childish but unsentimental quality that comes across as brutal but refreshing, while still being funny. In one scene maniacal music manager P. Diddy gets hit by a car and then chastises Jonah Hill for not picking up his phone when even he did. Later Russell Brand shows his broken arm to P. Diddy and they laugh it off as ""just a scratch"" and continue their show.Other than ""South Park,"" ""Get Him to the Greek"" has the same type of humor as ""The Hangover"" as well as those same endearing parts. While it doesn't fully land, Russell Brand has good acting moments as popular but lonely rock star propped up by idiot lies.Everyone in ""Get Him to the Greek,"" even Brand, is a bit of a dork, with much too much eagerness to please. The characters are written as lovable but realistic simpletons who do stupid things which are bad ideas, but are well intentioned enough. This makes them pretty enjoyable to watch in what is ultimately a very simple (but effective) point A to point B story. Kudos.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Sometimes funny, often uncomfortable.","To start, I didn't want to see this movie, but some friends dragged me to it. It was lude, it was crude; everything you would expect from Russell Brand.The characters weren't very realistic at all- Aaron downing a flask of whiskey so that Aldus couldn't drink it (instead of dumping it out), Aaron's girlfriend not breaking up with him after hearing him have sex while butt dialing her, and then her decision in the super awkward last scene. It also bugged me that Jonah was not reprising his role from Sarah Marshall, but Russell was- not a huge distraction, but I thought it lazy.Some of the funnier lines came from P. Diddy, but it was all script and had nothing to do with his acting; he's terrible. Rose Byrne also gave a weak performance, and her character's songs didn't even toy with innuendo, they were 100% genuine filth. The songs were perhaps the grossest bits of dialogue in the film.The timing of some of the scenarios is also really, really off. More than once we're told that they have ""less than an hour to get to the airport"" while stuck in traffic. In the three hours before his show we're shown Aldus visiting Jackie and having sex with her, Aldus visiting Aaron and trying to threesome with him and his girlfriend, and Aldus finding an exclusive party and getting wasted where he falls in a pool and learns his lesson.One redeeming quality of the movie is Brand, who is just an awkward accident waiting to happen, you can't stop watching him. The other is the not-so-subtle addiction and loneliness theme personified in Aldus, it gave the film some context and a little bit of heart amidst all the ludity.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Hilarious,"In a fantastic spin off from Forgetting Sarah Marshall, Aaron (Jonah Hill) working for pinnacle records gets the assignment of his dreams when he has to escort his drug addicted alcoholic rock star hero Aldus Snow (Russell Brand) to a anniversary concert.

Close but no cigarr,"I might be negative but this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen. Not even all the cameos from example Lars Ulrich, Pink, Kurt Loder, Himself (as Kurt F.

But big mistake!Very slow-paced, not many comical moments, verbal or otherwise, ruins this film quite a lot since it's one of those movies that has great potential if only the director and script writer to name a few had made some real effort in the making and not just rushing it.Russel Brand on the other hand is the one guy here that's actually funny for one times sake so it's not all bad, but not far from it sadly.My recommendation is to stay away from this movie if you expect a comedy with lots of laughs, cause that this is not.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
A very weak effort that is no better than most direct to DVD fare,Seriously I can see why Jonah Hill and Russell Brand took the paychecks for this movie but it is sorely missing the greatness of Jason Segel's writing. There is not much witty dialogue in this movie at all just Russell Brand being obnoxious which was fine in Forgetting Sarah Marshall but for 2 hours it gets annoying. I only gave it 2 stars because of course there are a few comedies that are far worse but this movie shows that Russell Brand can not carry a movie on his own. I would say Not Another Teen Movie was a better comedy than this movie. That is how far the writing sunk without Segel being involved. Wait for rental.,2.0,Anonymous,Music

A rare sequel that's better than its predecessor,"Don't ge me wrong: Forgetting Sarah Marshall is a very funny, memorable and likeable movie. But, it falls apart in the last act due to the annoying ""breakup due to a misunderstanding"" trope that's in almost every single romantic comedy ever. And while it's true Get Him To The Greek also uses this trope, it isn't as irritating here and doesn't last as long. All that aside, I personally think this film is just more fun to watch. Obviously, Russell Brand's character was the most memorable in the previous film, so giving him his own film where we get to hear more of his music makes sense, and his antics make for plenty of big laughs. Just as funny are Jonah Hill's attempts to rein him in and the various ways they fail spectacularly, as well as a multitude of great lines. Now, not every joke gets a laugh. In fact, some are graphic to the point of being uncomfortable. But, even the more graphic scenes get a few decent laughs out of me. The film also has some surprisingly strong emotional moments that were lacking in its predecessor. I know they're first and foremost comedies, but a little heart can go a long way.Brand and Hill are both at the top of their game here; they get plenty of laughs on their own, but also as a pair and they have solid chemistry, with Brand's rock star personality being offset well by Hill being more of the everyman. The real star of the film though is Sean Combs as Hill's boss; he gives some of the funniest lines and craziest deliveries and expressions in the film and he steals the show in every scene he's in. The only actor I didn't like was Elizabeth Moss as Hill's girlfriend. Not because she was bad; she just played the ""nagging love interest"" trope a little too well, to the point where it was hard to care about their relationship.If Brand had fully embraced the Aldous Snow persona and stuck to music, I think he would have had a far more successful career. The songs are a ton of fun and really catchy; even the intentionally bad one that ruins Aldous' career at the start is enjoyable in a ""so bad it's good"" way. As for the directing, some of the funniest scenes in the film are just the ways the two leads' antics while inebriated are presented, coupled with their hilarious expressions.Overall, Get Him To The Greek is a genuinely good comedy sequel, which is extremely rare. Even more rare: it's a comedy sequel that I think a real argument could be made for it being better than its predecessor. Simply put, it's more entertaining and funny. And for a comedy, that's what counts the most.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

A fair amount of madness, naughtyness, great humor and thoroughly entertaining; a nice way to end the day.

For some reason- making a movie out of the best part of another great movie fails,"As a huge fan of Forgetting Sarah Marshall, I originally had extremely high hopes for the movie. All of the best lines in Sarah Marshall were delivered by Russel Brand, and they were delivered perfectly. ""Take my Eyes but not my shirt!"". After seeing the preview I adjusted my expectations for this movie downward significantly.After the first 40 minutes of the movie I thought I was going to enjoy it, but every remaining minute of the film proved me wrong. At exactly, 40 minutes the tone, quality and fun of the movie went from about a 6.5 to a 4 at best. There are at least two very long scenes (5-10 minutes each) in the movie that I thought, why did no one in the room acting this out not ask, why? I am surprised that the movie was released in its current form.Also, 80% of the jokes in this movie are about drugs? Some drug movies are funny, and some drug jokes are funny in regular movies, but it didn't work at all here.I found that by the end of the movie when the characters had their big moments, I simply did not care. I didn't care what happened to any of them. I saw this in the theater, and will not be renting this when it comes out in Redbox for $1, and I own most, if not all of Judd Apatow's other movies.If you're a fan of Sarah Marshall, you should pass, and re-watch it instead, but you won't, like I did.

"Not funny or original, and not well written","Jonah Hill plays Aaron a young music producer who likes musician Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) and he's been charged to ""Get Him to the Greek"". The beginning of that sentence sounds familiar because this film is ""based on characters created by Jason Segal"" (as written in the credits). At least they credited it correctly because they take nothing from ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall"" (2008). Just two of the same actors playing characters with some of the same superficial aspects and that's it.I like Hill and Brand in small doses, but they just aren't likable and talented enough to carry an entire film. It was all unfunny jokes and dragged out ad nausea. I don't believe there was any spoofing going on here, just trying to steal some once funny lines. They had a character copying Isla Fisher from ""Wedding Crashers"" (2005) but she was just a cheap imitation.""Get Him to the Greek"" didn't have anything very funny and nothing original and just wasn't well written.

So much potential,"I'm a fairly rabid Brand fan, mostly because he brings a sense of philosophy and sophistication to his truly crass comic material that is unseen with most modern comedians. Accordingly, I went through to Get Him To The Greek with high expectations. The opening scene - a hilarious satire of Bono/Geldof-style charity music videos - had me just about convinced that this would live up to Brand's reputation. Sadly, for the rest of the film his own comic sensibilities jar somewhat with Stoller's awkward scripting. Every part of me wanted to like this film, even the reliance on toilet humour and unfunny celebrity cameos. It worked about 50% of the time, hence the score. What I see in place of a really good movie is a really good idea that could have, with the right people at the helm, become a classic rock 'n' roll spoof in the vein of Spinal Tap and The Rutles. Instead it's a generic, bombastic '00s Hollywood comedy script crafted around the music business.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
I laughed so hard I almost puked,"Get Him to the Greek is an excellent comedy, largely due to the hilarious performances by Jonah Hill and Russel Brand, and P. Diddy in a standout performance, but mostly because of the fact that it just doesn't give a damn.What I mean is that it shows scenes of excess that are so wacky, outlandish, and sometimes impossible that writer/director Nicholas Stoller has to know that they're wacky, outlandish, and sometimes impossible. But he also knows that they're very funny.I also found it nice to see Jonah Hill in a role that is a bit different from the sarcastic nerd that he usually plays, and he does a good job of playing the role of the uptight, nervous, well-meaning nerd. I was also very surprised at how funny P. Diddy was. I was expecting his role to be just a cameo, but it was actually a great comedic performance that nearly steals the show. But Russel Brand is the real star of this movie. Every scene he's in is funny.If you're a big fan of ""sophisticated comedy"" or you aren't a big fan of producer Judd Apatow's other comedies, you will probably dislike Get Him to the Greek.

Never mind the Buzzards,"Get him to the Greek is a slightly off beat gross out comedy from Judd Apatow stable, directed by Nicolas Stoller and is a loose spin off from Forgetting Sarah Marshall.Jonah Hill is Aaron Greenberg an ambitious music executive who is tasked by his boss (Sean Combs) to go to London and escort a controversial rock star to LA's Greek Theatre for a multi million dollar tour.The trouble is Brit rocker Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) is heavily into the sex, drugs, drink and rock n roll lifestyle and needs careful handling. Greenberg also has delicate issues in the domestic front as his girlfriend wants to move to Seattle to finish her medical residency.As Greenberg rushes to get him to the Greek, Snow always seems to stop off somewhere for some partying, boozing and sex. Even when they get near LA, Snow ends up diverted to Vegas to see his estranged dad where they end up with more partying and boozing until both Snow and Greenberg realise they want to reconcile with their respective partners.The film has a thin story which has been done before such as 'My Favourite Year.' It is sporadically amusing, some of the gross humour is funny and Brand manages to be just on the right side of being frazzled rock star without getting too irritating. However the plot is stretched and repetitive.

"Too Foul, not funny","Aaron Green (Hill) has 72-hrs to get a fading rock star Aldous Snow (Brand) to the comeback concert at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles.I thought this movie would be a complete disaster. In the beginning all I heard was obscene language, watched obscene sight gags, watched barfing as though the whole world thought that was funny, and listened to sexually explicit songs and also listened to fouled mouthed people who had no fear of using sexual body parts as part of their normal conversations. I wanted to shut this down, but I took a chance and waited until all the ugliness was out and eventually most of it was out, not entirely, mind you, but the worst parts were over. Then the story started. Oh, there were still foul mouthed people spewing their stuff, but it became no different than any other movie with bad language. Good God, am I getting used to this stuff?To continue a little bit with the story, Aaron has a very hard time getting a difficult out-of-control drugged up rock star to do what he must do to get back his rock-star career back. But, in order to get the job done and appease this rock star, Aaron ends up doing things he doesn't want to do, drink a lot, do drugs and have sex with other women. Have to admit some of those scenes were only funny when he was out of it via drink, and drugs and was not very graceful on his feet. There should have been more of those scenes because some slapstick was definitely called for. Otherwise nothing else was funny.What held me was the performance of Russell Brand. He was in his element or zone and although he also spewed foul language as called for in the script, he sometimes mumbled but you got the gist of what he was saying and that was sort of a reprieve for me not to hear the words. Jonah Hill was kind of miscast as he brought nothing to the table because his character was too low-keyed and he was not given any memorable lines. He was only funny when he was knocking things over in his drunken druggy stupors. Surprisingly that worked.Cameos: Mario Lopez, Billy Bush, Pink, Christine Aguilera, Meredith Vieria and others of lesser notoriety.Why these foul mouthed comedies appeal to the populace is beyond me, but they continue to try to outdo the previous same kind of foul mouthed sexual misadventure ""comedic"" movies. Comedy in America is dead. Now, all we have is bathroom humor. Sad. Soooo, not a complete disaster, but real close.Violence: No Sex Yes. Nudity: Yes. Drug usage: Yes.

WARNING: this movie will be offensive to most,"Get him to the Greek was comedy perfection. If you liked the last 2 minutes of The Hangover... you may like this movie. However, it is going to be way more than most people will be able to take. This movie is 2 hours of what we had a glimpse of in the photos at the end of the Hangover. It is twisted and sick and I loved every moment of it!If you are not easily offended, and can appreciate depravity, this may be the movie for you. It contains extreme drug and alcohol use, gratuitous sex and nudity, lots of vomit, and a general lack of respect for women, men, monogamy. Definitely NOT mainstream!Although it may sound like it's a one dimensional movie, it really had subtle complexities. I am keeping out details as not to spoil anything... At one point, Russell Brand's character, Aldous Snow, was a little tiring. I felt that that was the intent, because the story absorbed it, recovered and I forgot all about it. At another point during the movie, it got insanely funny, milk coming out of your nose funny, and then turned again to something a little different. This time, it got bizarre. I think some people left the theater at this point. It wasn't funny, but I didn't feel like it was trying to be. It seemed as if the intention was to convey the uncomfortableness of the situation. If so, it was done wonderfully.In the end, I really liked the characters Aldous and Aaron. I cared what happened to them and wanted things to work out for both of them. In spite of the extreme excesses portrayed in Get Him to the Greek, the movie got sweet at the end. it was a good ending to a completely insane movie.If you like stupid comedies with a little toilet humor and some sex you should like it. Take the movie for what it is... a raunchy, hilarious, good time. Don't take it seriously and no matter what absolutely NO CHILDREN should watch this movie.It's going on the shelf with my other favorites Dodgeball, Joe Dirt and Old School.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Get Him To The Greek sings through its unfocused plot quicker than a Metallica song.,"The British eccentric behaviour of the leather-coated Brand and the American lifestyle of the fatigued Hill was an odd combination to say the least. Two types of humour that are regrettably polar opposites from each other. Explicit ""London, ennit"" expletives against monotonous lines of musically inclined dialogue unfortunately just doesn't work, further cementing the juxtaposing, unfocused and ill-fated tones that Stoller explored. Perhaps we shouldn't forget about Sarah Marshall after all. Tasked in bringing the rock star Aldous Snow to the Greek Theatre in LA, a wannabe music manager must adjust to the rock'n'roll lifestyle in just 72 hours.I'm unable to score this highly for one simple reason. Depicting male sexual assault at the hands of a female for the sake of laughs is highly insensitive and just plain wrong. Imagine if the genders were swapped. It's not a joking matter, whatever the circumstance. Now that's out of the way, as mentioned before the two styles of humour failed to strum any guitars or bang any drums right from the offset, so the majority of laughs were diminished pretty early on.The unlikely bromance between Hill and Brand failed to generate any electricity, just simply a means to showcase an onslaught of drugs, alcohol and sex to a peer pressured individual for the sake of his career. Brand was either too exhausting when conveying jokes or too unnaturally restrained to allow Hill to have his say, as if watching two different characters. And when rap titan P Diddy is funnier than the entirety of comedic actors, you just know something's not right (he was surprisingly effective). As was the rest of the supporting cast, including Byrne and Moss. The plot however held no substance, comprising of montages that showcased Hill's vomiting abilities. The tone bravely became darker in the conclusive third act, tackling depression and loneliness, yet it abruptly disrupted the characters and the ""humour"". Whilst I appreciate the exploration, it was far too thin to be anything but inconsistent.Pretty much surmising the film. An inconsistent comedy that, whilst displayed talent from its supporting cast, predictably tarnished the lead characters by forcibly shoving the sentiment ""the rock'n'roll lifestyle isn't for everyone"" in our face and including a inconceivably sour sexual assault scene. By the end, you won't care if that make it to the Greek or not. All you will care about, is how Aldous thought ""African Child"" was a good idea...",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Aldous Snow Gets His Own Movie!,"I had commented on FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL, stating that Russell Brand's self-focused rock star Aldous Snow was probably my favorite part of the whole movie. Apparently, I wasn't alone and writer-director Nicholas Stoller has returned to give the lead singer of fictional rock band Infant Sorrow his own movie. As the film begins, Aldous has fallen back into a life of stoned/drunken debauchery as his music career hits rock bottom with his universally hated album ""African Child"" and his love life sits in shambles with his long-time lover model/pop star Jackie Q splits with their son. In Los Angeles, Aaron Green is an up-and-comer with Pinnacle Records and suggests to his boss that they hold a ten year anniversary concert with Infant Sorrow at the Greek Theater. Aaron is given the job of flying out to London, wrangling Aldous, and ensuring that he gets him to Los Angeles in three days for his performance.I was worried when I saw the original trailers for this film. The jokes weren't coming off well and I began to fear a movie I'd been looking forward to was going to fall flat. I was so glad when I finally got to the theater and saw the film because it is HILARIOUS. Russell Brand as Snow is one of the funniest characters in recent years and he completely embodies his role (probably because some aspects are loosely pulled form his own personal life). Surprisingly, he even manages to give his character some depth and earn sympathy as the film progresses when it becomes apparent he's not a one-note joke but begins to show a bit of humanity. Jonah Hill, while usually a scene stealer in his own regard, is constantly over-shadowed by Brand's bravado. His character was written as a passive person, which sealed the deal of playing second fiddle when you put him with Brand's stoned energy.There are some great cameos in the film. Colm Meaney shifts gears for a comedic turn as Aldous's father, Jonathan, and he's got great chemistry with Brand. The entire sequence in which Aldous detours to Vegas for a visit with his estranged father is the funniest in the film, beginning with an awkward conversation and ending in a full-blown rock star hotel room trashing. Even Sean Combs is hilarious in the film as Sergio, head of Pinnacle and Aaron's boss. He fell right into the improve/comedy vibe and I wouldn't mind seeing Combs making further appearances in Apatow-produced comedies.Major credit needs to be given to Jason Segel, Lyle Workman, Mike Viola, and the rest who wrote original music for Infant Sorrow and Jackie Q. Seriously, the music in the film is good enough that I had to get the soundtrack. Each of the songs sounds as if it could be a legitimate rock/pop song and each of them is hilarious and often addicting. After having seen this film a few times and gotten the tunes stuck in my head, I really wish Infant Sorrow was a real band.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Honestly I laughed real hard at a few scenes,but overall this is one disappointing affair",The introduction had me rolling around and laughing so hard that I could not expect that this movie would be disappointing. Some of the jokes were too much of the gross factor. Who are these people that think vomit is funny. It is just incredibly nasty. Russel Brand is obvious the highlight of the movie and he was as great as he was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall. However for some strange reason he isn't the lead. And this ultimately bombs the movie. While Jonah Hill has some comedic timing he just isn't right as a lead. And he has no range at all. It seems he always seems to be playing the same character. Russel Brand went from hilarious to some serious acting in no time. And one other surprise is Sean Combs in a parody of himself which was quite funny. While there were some real funny moments it didn't last long enough to carry the whole movie. Comedies are meant to be fun not disgusting.,4.0,Anonymous,Music
Funny,"""Get Him to the Greek"" had me cracking up within the first two minutes of the opening scene. I am not Russell Brands biggest fan, but I have to admit his portrayal as Aldous Snow, the totally drugged out alcoholic rock star was spot on and comical. Jonah Hill played the awkward, but lovable Aaron Green great as well. I was also really surprised how well P. Diddy did acting in this film.This movie is full of stupid laughs, but stupid laughs are my favorite. It reminds me a lot of Superbad; the plot really isn't all that amusing but the one-liners and the actor's delivery definitely bring the laughs.""Get Him to the Greek"" is definitely a movie I would put in and watch to de-stress and get a few good laughs out of after a bad day. It is one of the first movies that had me almost in the floor laughing in the theater in a very long time.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The bit players make the film work.,"A young intern at a record company is given the task of escorting an old and out of control rock star to the Greek theatre, for a comeback gig that will earn the company millions.Was the character from Forgetting Sarah Marshall really likable, or popular enough to warrant a spin-off film? Someone thought so, thus we have Get Him To The Greek, where Russell Brand plays Aldous Snow. While he has had smaller roles in other films, it's this flick and Marshall, where people recognize him. Those who do not know this is a spin off might think he is a note note actor. We'll see when more work goes his way. Jonah Hill does his thing, make snide comic remarks at situations that seem to be one of the chosen bits from a line- o-rama piece. Just have him stand there, spit out random things that are funny and we'll pick the best one. I hope his style doesn't get old fast, or he's in trouble.The film works for the most part, it's not as funny as you'd want it to be. The people that make this film funny are the supporting characters. Brand and Hill are probably the least funniest thing about this film. Sean ""P.Diddy"" Combs stands out, surprisingly. He has the comedic chops that fit this film and he worked it well. Colm Meaney, a character actor notorious for playing a-holes is hilarious as Snow's father. His scenes are great as well.Get Him To The Greek is mild entertainment, there are far more funnier films out there than this one and the characters are pretty generic that you don't seem to care if they make it to the theatre or not. One of the weaker Apatow style films, which is a shame because it has a lot of talent. Get Him To The Greek, is as I initially expected, a mediocre comedy that barely gets the laughs out. Still, it's funnier than a lot of comedies that came out the same year.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Sarah Marshall Gone Wild,"The tern 'toilet humor' is often thrown around without a care of how broad it is. Outrageous, tasteless jokes can - and often are - done badly, but when the script pulls no punches, the pacing stays good and the performances are sharp, you can get quite a gem. Forgetting Sarah Marshall did this well with off-kilter jokes and a hint of oddity. But this spin- off takes it well beyond that, adding a level of insanity that elevates it even above the likes of the Hangover. In other words, if you liked that movie, you should watch this. It remains consistently demented, with Russel Brand's Aldous Snow keeping the fires burning while Jonah Hill as the blindsided intern makes the perfect hapless victim. Also worth catching for Puff Daddy as a crazy record mogul and a sequence in Vegas that is just unforgettable.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

But my overarching theme here is I was made to feel wrong for thinking this movie was garbage. But you know, I did finally sit down and watch Get Him To The Greek recently and I was RIGHT! Oh my God!

Hilarious and enjoyable,"Taking place after the event of Sarah Marshall, this movie deals with the fact that a no longer sober Aldis Snow is having career issues. Aaron Green works for Snow's record label, and is also a huge fan of Snow. He comes up with an idea of recreating Aldis' best concert at the Greek Theater to help reinvigorate things. His boss tasks him with getting Aldis to the Greek on time and Aldis is more interested in partying than following Aaron's game plan.
This movie made me laugh so many times and so hard, and it still does no matter how many times I've seen it. Russell Brand was born for this role. I really do not have anything negative to say, except maybe Puffy's acting was not the best but he did have several of the funniest jokes.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Well it's the most Hardcore, Raunchy and Neurotic thing ever.","GET HIM TO THE Greek – CATCH IT ( B- ) Well it's the most Hardcore, Raunchy and Neurotic thing ever. The hardcore dialogues are so heavy that they are thrown directly on your face and trust me you won't resist laughing you're A** out. sadly just like Judd Apatow recent flicks this also goes out over the top in-between and does things in the end, just to make it more genuine which is sad because when the purpose of Russell band and Jonah Hall is to have fun why to over bored us with friendship and care dilemma. Anyways, Russell Band is Hilarious and Raunchy as you have never seen him before (though I hate to see Katy Perry marrying that Drag Queen), Jonah Hill is funny and Adorable but C'mon loose some Weight he was too big for the screen. Seriously, you are booking jobs but it doesn't mean you just keep growing into a Fat Cow. Rose Byrne is like never before, she is Nasty with Capital N, who knew that sweet looking girl like Rose Byrne can say and do nasty thing like that.. It was just Mind Boggling. Elizabeth Moss is really cute and refreshing. Love her. Kanye West is the MAN, he was funny, hilarious and simply DOP. His Mind-f****ing theory was Hilarious. Overall it's a fun movie and if the director wouldn't have gone over board with the characters and cut the movie in to ½ hrs instead of almost 2hrs, it could have been more effective but nonetheless watch it for some of the sickest things you have ever seen on Celluloid.

Get Him to the Greek,"""Get Him to the Greek"" was one of the funnier movies to come out in 2010. Within a few minutes of the movie starting it had me dying in laughter. The movie is based on an insane rock star Aldous Snow, played by Russell Brands, that just does what ever he wants and does not have a care in the world for anyone but him self. Between doing tons of drugs, drinking, and parting it is just one big spiral out of control. That is until actor Jonah Hill, who is Aaron Green a nerdy very good hearted person steps into Aldous Snows life. This movie is full of laughs the entire time and is recommended to any one that just needs to laugh a little bit or are just trying to watch an hilarious movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Aldous was not as funny being the main character,"I was really looking forward to this movie because in Forgetting Sarah Marshall Russell Brand was hilarious as rock star, Aldous Snow. And Jonah Hill was very funny as the obsessed guy.But that character is a one trick pony and it just doesn't work as the main character in this film. There were some funny things, but it is just not enough for a whole movie. And Jonah Hill comes back playing a different character.The whole African Child video in the beginning was funny, perhaps the best part. But the movie tries to get most of its laughs by having the characters do crazy stuff while high instead of having funny situations like in FSM. Also, besides African Child the movie didn't use enough of Aldous's crazy song lyrics.P Diddy is in this and plays a record executive that only knows how to cuss all the time. It's cute the first couple of times but good comedic writing needs more than dirty words to be funny.FINAL VERDICT: It's got some laughs, but don't expect anything great. Worth watching on cable.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Crude but brilliant,"Get Him to the Greek is an entirely different creature than Forgetting Sarah Marshall, so if you are looking for a Forgetting Sarah Marshall 2, you will be sorely disappointed. If, however, you're looking for a roller coaster ride of depravity, crudity, mockery, and unfathomably grotesque yet ridiculously funny, this is the movie for you. I have not laughed so much or so hard in a movie in a long time.The Aldous Snow we see here was not quite the character we might have expected from the brief caricature we glimpsed in Forgetting Sarah Marshall; but then, the Aldous Snow we see in Get Him to the Greek is a creature so riddled with drugs and alcohol, he hardly knows where he is from one day to the next. Heck, we hardly know what to expect from him one minute to the next, which is half the fun. Russell Brand's Aldous Snow was brilliant, and displayed Brand's versatility. This Aldous Snow was believable (much more so than the Aldous we loved from FSM). He was in turn hilarious, tragic, overstated, insightful, overbearing, stubborn, demanding, and sarcastic as I could have hoped for. Did I mention hilarious?Sean Combs was the big surprise. Sergio - what can I say about Sergio? The best lines in the movie were given to Sergio, and I am not sure many could have pulled them off as brilliantly as Sean Combs did. I will be laughing for weeks.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
One for the Russell Brand fans only,"I guess your enjoyment of this film would depend on your tolerance for the strong flavour that is Russell Brand. For me personally, I find him amusing in small doses only and as a result, this near-two hour movie was just a bit much.Jonah Hill however, is phenomenal and works brilliantly as the straight man (as he does in Wolf of Wall Street). He is perfectly cast alongside Brand and for me at least, comfortably the best thing about this movie.Despite being reasonably funny at times and poking some well-deserved digs at the music industry, Get Him to the Greek is just a bit too long and a bit too vulgar for me to really enjoy it.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Not a buy but it could be worth a rent...,"I believe it was a decent movie worth going and renting but nothing else, it was to boring be considered a movie I can watch each week or month. The most funny jokes are all in one scene that I think was brilliantly funny but past that scene it doesn't hold much for the audience to keep watching. I like movies that keep the audience entertained and interested in the characters, this movie has the same cycle over and over again where Aldus makes Aaron do stupid stuff and distracts him long enough for them to miss the airplane flights so Aldus can party some more each night. And even at the end I didn't feel like the characters truly developed throughout movie as much as they tried making it seem in the end.

It was alright but...,This is a superb movie BUT it is extra sleazy as well and if you are even a moderately semi decent person at the very least you will find yourself disgusted with yourself for admittedly liking it in the least bit. The movie is hilarious but I only gave it a 4 out of 10 because it could've done without all the excess crudeness the actors and actresses and writing was really way too good for that non sense. I related to Jonah Hills character the best and I think it teaches people a very valuable lesson about letting peer pressure take you down and the money and fame aren't worth selling your soul.

It has its strengths, such as catchy songs parodying rock and roll excess, and a plethora of bizarre cameos, including economist Paul Krugman, but the film's humor is ruined by too many dull moments.Judd Apatow fans should not be fooled into thinking this is one of his works... he did not write this, nor did Segel (who is credited as the creator of the characters).

Its nice to see fresh new actors like Sean Combs play the music mogul and veteran actor Colm Meaney as Aldous Snow's father get a significant part. I understand many people didn't appreciate the blu humor but I believe it was appropriate for the setting. This movie is destine to become a cult classic.

Didn't live up to the expectation,"Once again, we are dealing with a comedy that presented good potential but that ultimately disappoints.Yet, Get Him To The Greek started off pretty well in a sustained rhythm with flying dialogues, gags, songs more absurd one from another and a crazy spirit that augured good things. Jonah Hill is excellent as always and proves once again he is probably one of the best comedians of his generation, but P. Diddy is particularly surprising because he managed very well.But the more the movie progresses, the more it loses its comical aspect, the gags fall flat and become more and more rare, making room for very boring, satirical melodramatic episodes on the music industry and the life of an artist. In this sense, Get Him To The Greek probably would have worked better as a pure comedy, and shorten by 15 minutes to make it denser.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

Very funny movie,"This movie is just as funny as Forgetting Sarah Marshall, director Nicholas Stoller's debut as a director. He makes a very solid sophomoric effort here with Get Him to the Greek, which is a spin off on Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Stoller knows how to make the situations hilarious and how to make the laughs keep coming scene after scene.Jonah Hill is hilarious in the leading role as Aaron Green, a representative at a music company who has to get singer Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to the Greek Theater in Los Angeles in three days. Brand is a riot reprising his role as Aldous Snow. Brand shows that Aldous Snow is still just as ridiculous as he was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but he also shows us that there is to more to Aldous Snow than we thought we knew.Rose Byrne plays Jackie Q, a singer and ex-girlfriend of Aldous. She does a fine job, but she isn't given a whole lot to do with this role. The same goes for Elisabeth Moss, who plays Aaron's girlfriend Daphne. Moss is given more to work with and she does a good job.Sean Combs (a.k.a. P.Diddy) is a scene stealer and a hilarious supporting player as Sergio, Aaron's boss. Combs is a riot and shows that he can do comedy.The laughs keep coming and the situations are absolutely laugh out loud funny. While not as funny as Forgetting Sarah Marshall, it is still a very solid effort from all involved. Judd Apatow is one of the best comedy producers out there today, and he proves it again here.

You could argue he was only playing himself, but he was playing himself on Jeffrey, which is another thing altogether. I know a lot of people have a problem with Russell Brand, but this film wouldn't have been the same without him. I cannot think of a single other actor who could have done the job so well, but this probably comes down to the fact that Russell, himself, is not exactly a million miles away from Aldous when it comes to excess. Truth be known, Aldous is probably a lightweight compared to Brand, and would need to make his excuses and leave when the naked Siamese twins sat astride a donkey holding a lucky bag full of narcotics rode into the suite.

I think I broke a rib!,"Get Him to the Greek shows us what can happen when a regular guy gets the chance to party like a rock star. Aaron Green (Jonah Hill), a seemingly nobody record executive get his once in a lifetime chance as he is chosen to escort failing rock star Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to his comeback show at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles after a few scheduled appearances along the way. Of course Aldous is less concerned about schedules and more about partying, which provides conflict as Aaron's boss, Sergio Roma (Sean ""P.Diddy"" Combs), is constantly tracking his every move.Get Him to the Greek is like Planes, Trains, and Automobiles on drugs. Though it may be too soon to compare Jonah Hill and Russell Brand to the likes of Steve Martin and John Candy, these two definitely displayed a comedic chemistry. Similar to Planes, Trains, and Automobiles, Aaron and Aldous are two strangers on a journey that find trouble, and friendship, along the way. That is where the similarity ends. In their time, Martin and Candy would not have gotten away with some of the outrageous scenes found in this movie. These days, given what we can see daily on cable television, it would seem almost impossible for a movie to provide original, ""gross out"" comedy without being rated NC-17, but Get Him to the Greek pulls it off, with a bonus.My expectations of this movie were pretty low. I hadn't seen the trailers but have always enjoyed watching Jonah Hill and was excited to see him have a larger role in this movie. However, I assumed the film would be another unrealistic, gross comedy and nothing more. To my surprise, with the exception of some exaggerated scenes, the characters seemed to make the film believable, which served to enhance an already very funny film.The main focus of the film was on the characters, Aaron and Aldous, two men on opposite ends of the lifestyle spectrum. Aaron is the everyday, regular guy trying to lead a normal life, and Aldous, the famous rock star for whom everyday is a party. The settings in the movie really accentuate the lives of each; for Aaron, the ordinary apartment building and office job, and for Aldous, seemingly every five star hotel and night club from London to Los Angeles. All in all, if you like outrageous comedies, Get Him to the Greek will not disappoint. I felt as though I got my money's worth and then some.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Using words from the movie, it is ""not the kind of pretzels you'd put mustard on"", an off-the-hook story.If you enjoyed The Hangover, you're gonna love this movie, this one movie that pushed the envelope, showed the low end of naughtiness and lost control that for some people seems like normal life style.Favorite funny moments and quotes from the movie:Jonathan Snow: ""Oh, I managed Aldous for the first two years of his career"" Aldous Snow: ""Yeah he managed me while I was in his testicles, the minute he ejaculated the management ended"".Aldous sees Sarah Marshall on TV: ""Oh I used to have sex with her,..."", then listens in to her sighing on TV and says ""Yeah, you know, I did, I did.""Aaron is putting heroin up his ass in the airport, and Aldous comments loudly: ""Come'n mate, we ain't got all day,... it's not recreational, it's not meant to be a hobby, just get it out,...close the door behind you, hurry up!"". Aaron: ""Oh no, I have no sneeze, but i'm terrified that bowels will evacuate if i do"" Aldous: ""If you sneeze, it is very important that you clench at the same time"". Aaron: ""I'm gonna clench and sneeze, i'm gonna clench and sneeze, Aphsee!!""Destiny to Aaron: ""Hallo, testing 1,2,3 - is this thing on?

Whats with these ratings,"I feel as though only who are over the top in love with a movie or really do not like a movie rate these movies. Because this is the third box office hit that has less than the rating it deserves. It is more of a 7/10 than a 6.3/10. There is no way anyone would not like this movie except for the ending. It got to cheesy at the end and is still a 7/10.Jonah Hill is awesome as usual and Russell is his usual awesome self. They have a natural chemistry which comes through beautifully on camera.Comedy movies really require that there has to be a natural chemistry and natural delivery of jokes otherwise even with a top cast, forced comedy, no matter how funny you want it to be, will not come out that way.The comedic chemistry between the fun guy (Brand) and the serious guy (Jonah Hill) was perfectly delivered in this comedy.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
underrated,"This movie I underrated. I needed something to watch and I put this on because I saw it a long time ago and it's actually pretty good. I understand if people find Russel Brand annoying but I think ha can sometimes be very funny and him and Jonah Hill work together very well. Puff Daddy is really funny in this movie, he's a real scene stealer. This movie also kind of makes fun of the music industry and as a big music fan I like that. It's not as good as Spinal Tap which I consider the best comedy movie ever that is for obvious reasons an 11/10 but I give this movie a string 8/10. It has a few weird parts but most of it is very good. I have noticed a real decline in the quality of movies in the past 10 years. Stuff from the late 90s and early 00s was just so much better.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great Laughs From Both Jonah Hill and Russel Brand,","Get Him To The Greek is a brilliant movie with a great story line,an impressive comedy cast and some hilarious characters.The movie is a spin off to Forgetting Sarah Marshall,and revolves around the life of Russel Brand's character Aldous Snow.It certainly isn't as emotional as Forgetting Sarah Marshall,and Jonah Hill isn't a better lead role as Jason Segel,in my opinion,but fans of Forgetting Sarah Marshall will enjoy it.If you like Russel Brand as Aldous Snow and Jonah Hill comedies,you will enjoy this movie and some scenes will have you laughing out loud.Aaron Green (Jonah Hill) is hired to bring big solo singer Aldous Snow (Russel Brand) to his big concert in the Greek Theater that they have three days to prepare for.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Love it,"I cannot understand how anyone didn't enjoy this movie - it was the funniest thing I have seen in years, and I am very hard to please when it comes to comedy films - most of them are juvenile, corny and repetitive - not this one, some people on here need to get their heads out of their backsides.All three ""leads"", Russell Brand, Jonah Hill and P. Diddy or whatever he's called these days, do a great job - I have a feeling that the people who didn't like this movie are too stupid to understand the subtleties of some of the humour, they probably prefer intellectual stuff like Deuce Bigalow and Police Academy!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Laugh Out Loud Funny!!,"I didn't really know what to think of this movie when I went in. Is it a sequel? Is it a spin-off? What is it? Well, the answer to that is, Who Cares? It was funny! Jonah Hill always plays a great underdog character and Russell Brand is hilarious as always. The humor is pretty raunchy at times and if you're easily offended you may want to pass, particularly if anal references disturb you. Otherwise get ready for some great laughs. I even found myself listening to the song lyrics and laughing because they are so over the top.One thing I wasn't expecting was Sean Combs. I knew he was in the movie but I never thought he would be so good. He stole every scene he was in and had some of the best lines and best laughs.All in all this was a fun comedy and one of the few recent movies I want to see again.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The humor is pretty original and you definitely have no idea where the film is going at any time!,"'GET HIM TO THE Greek': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Nicholas Stoller writes and directs this sequel / spin-off to his surprise 2008 hit 'FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL', which he directed and actor Jason Segel wrote. This film centers around only the outrageous British rock star Aldous Snow (played once again, hilariously, by Russell Brand) and a record company intern (played by returning actor Jonah Hill, but weirdly not as the same character 'Matthew the Waiter'). This film tells the story of Aaron Green (Hill) trying to get Snow to a reunion concert at L.A.'s Greek Theater from London in something like three days. The concert was his idea and his chance to prove himself to his boss (played humorously by Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs) but Snow is suffering through a midlife crisis and turns out to be impossible to control. All kinds of hijinks ensue as Green desperately tries to get Snow to the concert in time.The movie is just one witty and hilariously outrageous joke after another but then it surprisingly turns dramatic and at times serious as we get to know the characters more and it actually builds to a pretty emotional climax. This is my favorite type of comedy. Not only is it nonstop hilarious but it has heart and real emotion as well because the characters feel real and we actually get to see their problems.The film is not quite as classic as 'MARSHALL' and it definitely doesn't benefit from the stunningly graceful beauty of Kristin Bell, although she does make a cameo appearance, but it's about as good as you could expect from a followup to that film, which is one of my favorites. The humor is all pretty original and you definitely have no idea where the film is going at any time. It's brilliantly written and directed by Stoller and both Brand and Hill are classic in the film. They're both comedic genius in my mind! Probably one of the funniest films you're likely to see this summer.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pmr_F8e44c",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Sweet and touching,"Poor lonesome Aldous Snow, child of a brainless mother and of a monster father, tries to keep himself up as he can. Don't blame him for being on drugs: who could otherwise take the amount of pain he does singing with both his heart and left arm broken?In love with a freaking slut, father of no child of his own, a fan with eating disorders as his only friend... he does greatly singing before an audience that ignores that 'Infant sorrow' means to him more than just the name of a band.I enjoyed every moment of the film which is funny and sweet and touching and shows an incredible care for details. Bangers, beans and Mash had become one of my favorite songs.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly funny spin-off,"I wasn't that big of a fan of Forgetting Sarah Marshall but I was seemingly interesting in seeing how this film would be. I recently watched this film and thought it was great and very funny at many scenes. Though, its humour in this is more dirty and raunchy compared to the smart, clever, and witty humour seen in Sarah Marshall. There are enough classic scenes in this film to make me want to go back and see it for a second, third or even fourth time. Get Him to the Greek pushes every envelope in the comedy world. From crazy sexual jokes to drug jokes, this movie has it all. What's hilarious though is that considering how raunchy the film is, there is a ton of heart as well. That is exactly how Judd Apatow films always work out. Now, Apatow did not direct the film but he was the main producer and it has his style all over it.Sean ""Diddy"" Combs absolutely stole this movie. Every time he was on screen, he was pretty funny. I am sure it had a lot to do with the writing but his delivery was perfect. It was if he saw Dave Chappelle show episodes that made fun of him and he embraced that by using that to his advantage in this film. He was just as funny as the film's leading stars! In my opinion, Russell Brand and Jonah Hill need to make more movies together. Neither of them outshines the other. All of their jokes were perfectly balanced out and every time they were on screen, the jokes were flowing perfectly. This is one of those rare comedies that is consistently funny throughout the entire film. Though there seemed to be some downhill in the film toward the third act but it went back up again and caught back its funny sense. The film had many great moments but many awkward and weird moments. Overall it was a surprisingly funny film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Liked it but not what I expected,"Firstly, I love Russell Brand. Secondly, I have seen but pretty much hated My Favorite Year. I thought this was going to be the same thing. It is and then it isn't. It's not as much of a comedy to be honest. And they totally sell it as a comedy, which they do with all Apatow movies and I don't know why. Forgetting Sarah Marshall to me was barely a comedy because it's about a guy who is depressed the whole time. This isn't really that different. Just in this case it's a drug addict rock star who is pretty much headed on the road that many people have taken in recent years and ended up as a breaking news obit at the top of this website. It's another bromance as well, which is fine by me. All these movies are more sentimental than they'd have you believe in the trailers. I personally think that's detrimental to the movie because it makes people expect one thing and get another and then write on the internet how disappointed they are. Problem is, it's not a bad movie. It's actually a good movie about the record industry and people and how they treat each other in such a ridiculous lifestyle with some funny bits thrown in.I love Russell Brand and Jonah Hill together. I think they have the best chemistry. Their scenes together, pretty much the whole film, were more personal than funny. The more comedic parts usually happen when other people enter the mix. P. Diddy, for example, had a much larger role than I expected and he was okay in it. I probably would have cast an actor with more comedy experience, as well as choosing a different rock star cameo for Jackie Q's other love interest. But apart from that I really have no complaints. Perhaps I would have used more of Aldous' songs throughout the film, but that's because I quite like Brand's voice. I don't know that it was necessary for the plot.Other stuff. It's an R for a reason. There's sex humor and drug stuff going on. There are some breasts but not much else in the nudity dept. that I can recall. I guess I'd recommend it for people like me who like English rock stars and comedies with warm fuzzies.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Disgusting, hilarious, and sweet","At its heart this is another Apatow late coming off age movie. Everyman officially has moved from Tom Hanks to Jonah Hill – I shudder to think what that means. But he's really good and convincing in the most random and insane situations. Most of those come from Russell Brand's rock star character Aldous Snow (is that Aldous Huxley meets Aurora Snow?) – part rock savant, part purveyor of petty musical porn. But he is amazing in the role. And Sean Combs is brilliant. He's so good you realize he can be completely ironic about his own mythology and powerful enough to stick it to the music business. As does the movie. It's pointed, unlikely, slapstick, disgusting, hilarious and sweet. And you never know where it's going to head next.A real bonus is the wonderful Elizabeth Moss (sooo good in Mad Men) as the unlikely girlfriend to Hill. The threesome attempted between these three characters in the bedroom says a lot about the clash of decades and generations. Brilliant and unrelenting.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Best film in the Aldous-verse,"As you've probably realised, this is the second film to feature Aldous Snow, the lothario rocker we first met in Forgetting Sarah Marshall.But don't try and build a ""canon"" for the Aldous-verse because you won't be able to. He's back because he was the best thing in it.And be glad they did, because this is a much better film than Forgetting Sarah Marshall.It's an all-out caper across the USA as music agent Aaron (Jonah Hill) tries to get wayward rock legend Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to an anniversary gig at the Greek Theatre in LA.But really it's just an excuse for a bunch of bawdy jokes and crazy situations, with just the right amount of sentimentality.The songs written for the film are smutty and vulgar and parody the worst indulgences of the industry.There are plenty of celebrity cameos and Sean Combs (Puff Daddy/P. Diddy etc) is great in his supporting role as the head of the agency. Rose Byrne has fun as Snow's on-off girlfriend.But the stars of the show are Hill and Brand. They have great chemistry and pull off a string of wildly funny scenes.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great still in 2023,"This movie ages well, because the idea of wanting our old artists or favorite bands to be as great as they were at the peak will never die. Get Him to the Greek is an intensely funny movie with a surprising amount of heart and emotion. Of course you get your classic gags that come along with R - Rated comedies (drug use, naked women, I'm not complaining just listing some of the classic stereotypes shown in this movie) However, you also get more heartfelt moments than you would think as the movie assesses the emotional toll that being a rock and roll star has on somebody. This movie is a definite watch even in 2023, although I feel like they could've eliminated the story line with Jonah hills girlfriend all together as it only slows down the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A spin-off that doesn't disappoint...,"I was very excited about seeing this movie and I wasn't disappointed.A Russell Brand fan from way back, and a fan of Sarah Marshall, I was excited about this movie but was slightly concerned that my expectations would not be met, having been let down by sequels and spin-offs in the past. I am not a fan of many recent big budget comedies and was concerned that the charm of Forgetting Sarah Marshall would be missing from this film. Thankfully, GHTTG does not try to be another FSM, but stands independently as a hilarious and interesting movie.The story flies by from one hilarious incident to the next and the resolutions of various comedic situations are largely unpredictable, which keeps the audience hooked. I found so many of the performances clever and the characters engaging that I did not want the movie to finish.My only criticism about this film would be that I found it overly soppy and sentimental in some parts, something which makes me uncomfortable in movies that aren't meant to be taken too seriously.But although the movie does not cause viewers to reflect on larger societal issues, (and is less successful the few times it does try this) as a light-hearted, entertaining film it is highly effective. Both times I saw this movie at the cinema the audience laughed hysterically at every joke from the start to the finish and this certainly helped my enjoyment. I am baffled as to why this film has received some less-than positive reviews.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great movie lots of fun, but","It seems to me that this is a retelling of the Peter OToole comedy, My Favorite Year. Still one of my favourites. I must admit, I am not much of a Russell Brand fan, but, I am a huge fan of the other actors in this movie. That was the only reason I went to see it. I was pleasantly surprised (although, I have seen Brand in St. Trinians - my daughter insisted I see it - and he was not half bad in that), I actually enjoyed Brand in this, and he did remind me of the Peter OToole character in My Favorite Year.This ridiculous 10 line guideline thing is a pain. Since if one is succinct enough, 2 lines will more than suffice. I have seen both movies and enjoyed them both. If nothing else Get Him to the Greek has inspired me to find the other movie and watch it again. I still find it enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the best movies of 2010,"Me and my mate saw this movie as an advanced screening in Sydney on Sunday. The cinema was packed! But we didn't care as we were laughing from beginning to end - a fantastic consistency of laughs throughout the whole movie and likable characters should put this title to the top of your ""movies to watch"" list.There aren't many sick jokes, including dirty slap-stick comedy. Which makes this easier to watch with family or relatives.One thing I found though, was that many scenes that were in the trailer/s aren't in the actual film.Overall, if your looking for a good time (and if you loved ""Superbad""), check out ""Get him to the Greek.""",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Very funny but also a heartbreaking story of celebrity madness.,"Yesterday I enjoyed a showing of ""get him to the Greek"" starring Russel Brand, Jonah Hill, and a breakout performance by Sean ""puffy"" Combs. Brand plays the part of washed up and drugged out international rock superstar Aldous Snow to perfection, seemingly drawing fro his own experience on the gritty streets and shady bathroom stalls of Great Britain where the comedian-cum-actor spent his younger days as a VJ for MTV's Heathrow office, where he allegedly got canned for introducing Kylie Minogue to his dealer. Jonah Hill delivers an equally poignant performance as Snow's weekend chaperone proving the Apatowian comedy formula holds strong and that a Keanu Reeves type leading man is not an integral part of producing a blockbuster. Sean Combs perhaps played the most hilarious role in the film as intense studio head ""Sergio"", and was responsible for many of the most memorable lines of the film, giving a performance described by Brand to be ""his comedy equal"". Though this film was laugh out loud funny throughout, it also effectively conveyed the surreal sadness and loneliness that celebrity life affords. Brand's personal take on the subject matter was obvious throughout and allowed for a realistic, though heartbreaking take on celebrity, drug use and the inevitable eventual descent into madness. This film was quite good and I recommend it, however the subject matter is not for the consumption of children.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Loved it,"I cannot stand Jonah Hill. A friend asked me to see this with her, and I went thinking I might get a laugh or two out of Russel Brand. I was dreading having to watch Hill on screen for so long.Boy, was I wrong.I did not stop laughing. From the second Brand appeared on screen, the cinema was full of giggles and bursts of laughter. Anyone who has read Brand's book will notice a few home truths with him and his character. That being said, he was completely believable. Hill was surprisingly likable, Rose Byrne was amazing as always, and P.Diddy shockingly good. I think the fusion of American/British humour was played brilliantly. I hated the Hangover, LOVED this and am planning on seeing it again and again.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Funniest Film of 2010,"Get Him to the Greek is the hilarious spin off of an already funny Forgetting Sarah Marshall. In Greek we are re-united with the rock star Aldous Snow from the first film. However the once prominent rock star has taken a turn for the worse after his latest Single ""African Child"" (Trapped In Me) was labeled as racist and ""the worst thing to happen to Africa since AIDS"". Aldous then falls of his once pure ways and falls into his drug and women habits. Meanwhile in US Jonah Hill return to the series. Strangely though, he plays a different character than the one from the first film. He then receives the assignment of transporting the unstable Snow from England to a show at Los Angeles's Greek Theater. While not ground breaking in any way, this film is a crack-up throughout. Sean ""Diddy"" Combs stars as Hill's boss and steals the show. Who knew rap artists could be funny? Combs' one liners and text messages sent to Hill will keep you rolling with laughter the whole film.The film also does a great job of keeping the viewers fully engaged and entertained at all moments. Whether it be the craziness or hilarity delivered by Brand, or the surprise of Combs' performance fans, are not to be disappointed. While in the theater I do not believe there was one quiet moment. Between the furry walls, or Snow's nasty drug addiction which leads to a gut-busting scene in the airport, there wasn't a quiet moment the whole time. The soundtrack is also a triumph in this film. Released on a CD before the release of the film, was the Infant Sorrow CD. Infant Sorrow is Snow's band and also acts as a soundtrack to the film. This was a creative and very appealing way to go after a soundtrack. The songs featured in the film are all memorable and have lines that will make you ask what you are listening to, and then laugh it off. Russell Brand who plays Snow leads on vocals on all the songs.Greek acts as a perfect summer buddy comedy film. While not ground breaking on any levels Greek delivers big laughs minus very little pain (barring the hypocritical ending). IF films like Pineapple Express, Forgetting Sarah Marshall or Super Bad is a choice in your movie collection, then Greek is a must see. And with its soon to be released date or September 28th it's the perfect time to see this hilarious film.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Lots of profanity, sex, drugs, and rock n roll, but good!","Well, this is one profanity lace, drug fueled, alcoholic celebration movie. If you're into that sort of thing you should enjoy it.Russell brand is a hoot as a 'party all the time' type of rock star. Jonah Hill, is also funny as the junior member of a record company sent to bring Russel to a concert in the use. Of course you know what is going to happen. The only thing not believable was Jonah Hill in a relationship with Elizabeth Moss. Just seem to be that real. On a good note, I didn't realize what a great actress Elizabeth Moss is. I've only seen her in some short TV spots. But she's a real natural. Very good performance.If you watch this movie, and drink along with it, you could possible lose your eyesight!",,Anonymous,Music
