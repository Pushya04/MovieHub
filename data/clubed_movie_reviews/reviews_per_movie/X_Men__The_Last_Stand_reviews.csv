"Good, but still disappointing","First of all, let me say that X3 was a great action film. If you want to have a great time at the movies, this is a fun film to watch. However, as a fan of X-Men and the film trilogy, there were some problems with the film.There are a lot of characters that are undeveloped. It's not such a problem with the one's we already know, but it is for the one's that we don't. There's also unneeded information for certain characters that aren't really in the movie. Certain characters play big roles, but we don't get to know them. Others have minor roles, and the info is meaningless. For instance, a character is introduced in the prologue to the movie, but is barely seen in the remainder of the film. The movie was way too short. It seems like everyone's in a hurry throughout the film. If it had been 2 and a half hours, it would have been able to develop all of the characters, and the back stories would have been more relevant to certain characters. The movie is action packed and fun, but it really doesn't draw you into it the way the first two did, say for a couple of scenes.Overall, it was worth seeing on the big screen, and I'm glad that I saw it. It is a good film. But again, you'll be a little disappointed as an X-Men fan. 7/10.One final thing, stay after the credits for the final scene. It seems nobody saw the entire movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

So you don't want to be a mutant...,"Who wouldn't want the ability to walk through walls or fly away into the sky? Who wouldn't want to be able to lift cars hundreds of feet into the air or turn a cloudy day into a gorgeous sunny afternoon? For some this is a dream come true. For others than can't function without destroying their natural way of life, it is a curse. The premise for the latest installment of the X-Men saga is just that.X-Men: The Last Stand goes deeper into the mutant versus human controversy. All of the favorites are back with the addition of some needed support. The main focus of this film is the introduction of a vaccine that can rid a mutant of its powers. It is called, ""The Cure"". Magneto, played once again by Ian McKellan, gathers his Brotherhood for a war on the mankind once more. His eyes are fixed on the one person who holds the answer, a small, innocent child with a gift so powerful, Magneto will risk everything for it.Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) upon hearing gathers his group of X-Men to stop the menacing Magneto. He is short a few of his troops from the last film. Cyclops is still lamenting over the loss of his dear Dr. Jean Grey. When he can't take it anymore, he drives out to where he last saw her. Her voice has driven him to the edge until she appears. Who he meets isn't Jean, but her true self; Phoenix. She is Jean's alter ego, the most powerful mutant Charles or Magneto ever encountered.Director Brett Ratner of Rush Hour fame delivers an action packed, special effects driven adventure. His style is unlike that of the previous X-Men films. His version is more along the lines of a regular action flick. A lot of explosions, stunts galore, and a so-so script. What made the other films enjoyable was the emphasis on the characters. This film has almost too many to include. Although some weren't present and some don't make it, there are too many side stories going on than are needed.The mutants are always a blast to watch. Hugh Jackman returns to his old guns, relying on witty remarks and vicious attacks on unsuspecting victims. Somehow it doesn't get old. Kelsey Grammar is introduced as Dr. Hank McCoy, better known as Beast, a blue skinned, blue haired genius who wants nothing more than this war to cease. Also introduced is Angel, who sadly doesn't play too much of a role. On the other side of the battle is Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones). A one man wrecking crew whose momentum is unstoppable to the strongest of obstructions. Beside him is Callisto, a speedy little devil whose impact is virtually just filler. There is more emphasis on characters like Kitty, the girl who can walk through walls, and Collossus, a metal strongman, and less emphasis on Rogue and Mystique.Without these characters in play, the film is special effects driven. Impressive CGI graphics and and intelligent use of the mutants powers go a long way in the making of this film. Characters like Storm (Halle Berry) rely solely on the effects provided by Ratner and his team or visual effects artists.As far as summer blockbusters go, this film isn't one to be trifled with. It presents a lot of aspects that a blockbuster should have: a lot of big name actors, reliable story lines, stunning effects, and most importantly, an appeal to a large audience. The movie might be a little bit mature for children, but comic book fans and fans of the films will thoroughly enjoy this. The only remaining question left is; will there be another?",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Enjoyable, Satisfying Conclusion","I must be one of the few, it seems, who enjoyed X-Men: The Last Stand. I have been an X-fan for many years and my expectations were still met by this film. Do I think that it could have been a bit better? Certainly. The script seemed to pack too many elements into a short running time. With those issues solved I believe that it would have been fantastic. Still, I felt that X-3 was almost on the level with X-2's greatness. It has taken another viewing and some time to reach this point. At first, I felt betrayed at the many liberties taken with story elements. But after I left the theatre, I could not shake the feeling that I needed to view it again. After the second time, I came to grips with the film and now like it quite a bit.Contrary to some critics' reviews, I do not believe that X-3 became overshadowed by action. There really is quite little of it until the finale, which feels quite epic. There are excellent character moments sprinkled throughout. The acting is generally superb across the board. More Ian McKellen is always nice, and Hugh Jackman impresses again with Wolverine. Kelsey Grammar actually does a respectable job with Beast. The other characters all do well with what they are given. There are a few poorly written one-liners that reminded me of the ones in X-Men 1, but the script is mostly intelligent with powerful themes such as the Cure. Another difficulty is that the film cannot pay the proper amount of attention to the many characters, including the new ones. But they still all seem to contribute something to the larger plot movement in the film. Ratner's only obvious difference from Singer is his frenetic pacing and energy. X-3 really moves quickly, and this does not have to be a negative. I also enjoyed the emotion that was hinted at in X-2, and came into full force during X-3. I do not think that it reached sentimentality or was melodramatic; it really felt powerful. The stakes really do seem to be high for the final chapter of this trilogy. The viewer finds this out quickly concerning Cyclops and Mystique, later with Jean and Xavier (in a particularly awe-inspiring scene), and during the finale in a nice moment with Jean and Wolverine. I think that many of the problems people are seeing in the film resulted from the pressure the entire production team was placed under in order to develop and finish the entire film in less than a year.But all in all, I have really come to enjoy it as a satisfying film that met my high expectations. Look at it this way if you must. Try to see X-3 as not a stand-alone film but more as the third portion of one large story. The first X-Men had the difficult job of introducing a large ensemble cast of mutants and establishing a story and tone (other superhero films with one primary character have it much easier). X-2 had the most enviable position as most of the characters had already been partly developed and it did not have to conclude the entire story. It could work mostly on its own, just having to leave threads open for the next one. X-3 had the extremely difficult task of closing out the entire trilogy for good. I see it more as the third portion of one expansive tale, thus in the larger scheme it must move quickly toward a complete conclusion. In my opinion, the many actors under the abrupt switch in direction did an x-cellent job.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A generally enjoyable film with a few major flaws,"First off, X-Men: The Last Stand was by no means ""drivel."" In combination with the previous ventures, moviegoers and fans will receive a decent whole. The plot itself is not convoluted, but there are numerous mini-plots for just about every other character in the film. The huge number of plot lines Ratner chose to cast wound up limiting the film, removing key emotional elements. The film just was not long enough to adequately cover everyone's story. The music did not add anything to the movie either, it seemed tacky and amateur. Through length, plot numbers and music, X3 failed to properly and satisfyingly tie up the trilogy.Problems aside, X-Men did succeed in creating a fabulous action-driven film. Ratner and Fox worked magic on the special effects side of things. I was particularly impressed with the opening scene, which found a 20 year younger Xavier and Eric (Stewart and McKellan) at the house of Jean Grey.Despite being somewhat of a letdown, the film does bring in some interesting parallelism to the first two films. Speaking of the first films, I recommend viewing them right before or soon after seeing the third, as viewing them reminds you that you do care about the characters (being underdeveloped in X3). Most should find the third entry reasonably enjoyable and miles ahead of poorer entries into the superhero genre (Fantastic Four, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Ultraviolet, and the extraordinarily bad Batman Forever and Batman and Robin).",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X  Men make last stand due to bad screen writing and poor plot,"Wow, where do I start on this fiasco of a movie. In regards to my affection for the first two movies in the series, please see my rating for them. I gave them both high marks, and had anticipated the third movie with much joy and glee. My glee turned to flee not long into this horrible flick. The only thing that remotely saves it from being a total disaster is the graphics, and the hope that you will see it develop into a good movie. If you wasted 8 buck o roonies like myself to see this in theater, well don't feel bad, because some poor jokers sat out all night to see it on opening night. This one is even debatable on rental. Let it go to the special section, or as I call it ""The Last Stand.""",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not Singer's X-Men, but a worthy coda to a fantastic trilogy.","It is safe to say that every X-Men fan, or any movie fan for that matter would have much rather seen Bryan Singer finnish out his first two X mens into a brilliant trilogy. I was very unsure that Brett Ratner, who has directed some pretty decent movies, not great, but not terrible could do a good job. Much to my chagrin Brett Ratner exceeded my expectations on how well he could direct the final chapter of this comic masterpiece.Although I feel a comic book movie has yet to top Batman Begins, I feel that all superhero movies owe it to the X men for 'relaunching' this superhero craze that we have been blessed with, and for that we have to thank Singer.For those who have seen the movie you can agree with me that Ratner did not give us the in depth character build up that Singer gave us. Instead, giving us a fun action packed movie, with a little character glimpse at Wolverine and a touching moment between Kitty and Bobby. However, that is not the director that Ratner is. Ratner is 'an action' director, one who focuses mainly on fight sequences and explosions mixed in with some mild humor, and that is what made this movie work.Although Singer's genius was deeply missed in this third chapter, I do not feel we need to be ashamed at the third movie. I know we all feel that Singer could have given us a better close on his trilogy, Brett Ratner still needs to be applauded for giving us his different yet great take on the wonderful and never to be forgotten X-Men series.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A true fans opinion,"The latest X-Men movie is disappointing to say the least. I don't know who had the final say on the finished product, (Brett Ratner, the producers or editors, or the studio) but the end result is an eyesore that has been rushed through production.The movie is full of unexplained cut scenes that run into each other, that leave you frustrated and a little confused. The plot is sub-par with very poor dialog. The plot is not that difficult to follow, it's just full of holes. Holes that leave true X-fans wanting more. The music score throughout the entire movie is horrible and off. Music makes a movie. The writer of the score of X-Men 3 should be ashamed of the final product.The unexplained introduction of a dozen or so new mutants was attempt to cover up the lame plot. The new mutants come and go without explanation or warning and spout a cheesy one-liner of dialog before they are rushed of the screen. There is an occasional curse word that gets all of the prepubescent teens in the audience a chance to chuckle like a little schoolgirl in their Sunday's best.Brett Ratner was a poor choice to direct the third installment of the X-Franchise. With his not so impressive track record of Rush Hour movies, with Rush Hour 3 in preproduction; he should have been last on the list to direct this highly anticipated movie. It's like the powers that be just drew his name out of a hat and said lets go in that direction.I'm not saying it's the worst movie out there, but it is defiantly the worst of the three. It was a poorly planned and over rushed movie that doesn't live up to the standards of true fans, such as myself. I've been reading and collecting X-Men comics for years and I know all of their back-stories and sub-plots and I expect it to at least live up to the standards of the previous two movies.The end result is a movie that does not live up to the standards of the trilogy. The bad plot and dialog is replaced by CGI and special effects that try to district you from this poor movie that you shell out your hard-earned cash to see. It's worth seeing, but try to go see the lower priced day showing of the film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Director ruined movie,"X1 and X2 were different movies then X3. X3 has a new director who apparently could care less about the quality of the show or its characters but instead cares about the $$$. All aspects of X3 were rushed and poorly thought out. You could even see in the faces of the actors the uncomfortable sense of ""hurry and up get the movie over"".The only reason it received a good rating from Users is the momentum from the first two movies, on its own X3 would be a failure. It is obvious X3 was a sell out and a lead in to more $$$ in 2007's Wolverine. Why why why did the director change! Sad to see a great series die off.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A breathtaking achievement in film making,"film is a visual medium, this is the first film to ever capture that potential, all the characters are adeptly handled with one shots that tell the whole story and no character is left w/o a pay off shot, this a fast paced visual story that will leave you in awe.do not mistake this for shallow, it is just a realization of what film can be, every f/x shot revolves around emotion, and the character turmoil resonates far more than the first two films. ratner is a master at telling his story with a shot and a line, unlike the over hyped singer who relies heavily on dialogue cause he doesn't understand the potential of the medium he is using.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Really, really good!!","I think this is one of the best comic adaptation for the cinemas. A lot of mutants, a lot of power. The Phoenix is the best of the movie. The final battle is perfect. Kelsey Grammar like Beast is very good. Halle Berry has a more important participation in the movie, but Hugh Jackman is the center of the attentions. And a note for you... don't leave the cinema until the end of the credits, it's a surprise after them. One more thing. Ben Foster (Angel) don't do anything in the movie, he's just a support character. Colossus too, but by the way, his transformations and his classic Wolverine throw are very good. And the scene with Wolverine and Jean/Phoenix is one of the bests that I ever saw in a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Okay, but could have been better.","I was so excited about seeing this movie. The first one never made much of an impression on me but the second was so much better. However, I just didn't feel very emotionally involved with the characters in this film. I felt the story just never allowed the characters to grab the viewer's interest. I also thought that some characters weren't given enough involvement while others were given far too much. I think the director spent more time on the special effects, which were excellent, instead of spending time on character development. But overall, for a summer film, X-3 delivered just enough to be worth the trip to the theater.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Well done for #3,"I was able to catch a preview of this film on May 18. I am a huge X-Men fan and was reading earlier buzz about this film's shortcomings from other critics. I was very surprised at this film's quality. This film was very good especially for a third installment. I would venture to say this film was my favorite of the three, narrowly beating out X-Men United. I felt there would be a lot of confusion in tying in Magneto and Dark Phoenix but the story was very coherent. I also felt like Halle did a little better in this installment, considering better powers and better writing. The action scenes were great, especially in Jean's house. I was pleased to see them stay faithful to certain scenes in the Dark Phoenix Saga comic. The other ""bit-part"" mutants were not as annoying as I'd anticipated, as some of them actually were very impressive. I was very impressed with this film's ""shockers"" and unpredictability. Some things I definitely did not see coming. While not the perfect experience everyone hopes for, it was still well-made and should satisfy the X-Men fan base. Good story, great fights, great special effects, true to some of the comic stuff, great unpredictability, annoying Pyro. 'Nuff said.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
More Than They Could Handle,"X3's title, ""The Last Stand,"" and it's premise, which I'm sure you all know about by now, gives the impression that this is it for the franchise, and the war between humans and mutants will be that of WWII, but instead of ""The Big One,"" it becomes Greneda.I'm not saying it is all bad, there are high points, but in the end the bads outweigh the goods, and this becomes one of the most highly anticipated disappointments of the year. Everything that the fans had asked and/or waited for, such as The Danger Room, The Sentinals, and especially, (this is what I was waiting for) the return of Jean Grey as Pheonix, was there, but was handled with a ""Here you go so stop bothering me,"" attitude, meaning they were there, but just enough so none of the fans could say anything else, and there lies the problem. As readers of the comics know, the X-Men universe has a mind numbingly huge roster of heroes and villains, and with so many, everybody is bound to have a favorite they want in the movie. So, i guess they tried to appeal to everybody, adding about 15 mutants as main characters. Add to this, the overall continuing plot of the war between us and them, the main plot of this movie about a ""cure"" for mutants and their opinions on the subject, and two sub-plots involving a new mutant who is reason for the ""cure"" and Magneto's quest to capture him and The X-Men's attempt to stop him, and finally the return of Jean Grey as Pheonix, who is now one misunderstood word away from disintegrating the entire world, and the X-Men having to track her down too, and it just becomes too much, and the movie implodes, not giving enough time to flesh out anybody, except Wolverine, who learns about teamwork, and more less assumes the role of leader/mentor.That's not even all of plots. There are several other issues going on. Such as the triangle between veterans Iceman, Rogue, and the newbie Kitty Pride, which causes Rogue to branch off into a side story of her own, Mystique and her unfortunate accident, and another newbie Angel and the issues with his father, who is involved with the ""cure,"" and finally Beast, another highly anticipated new character torn between the opportunity of finally ""fitting in,"" or remaining the blue hulking animal that he is. There aren't even soap operas that have this much going on, it is just too much. You would think that with all of this, everybody would have something to do, but amazingly, nobody really does much of anything, because it's all crammed into the span of about 90 minutes, so all potentially good ideas are ended in very anti-climatic ways, and new mutants introduced are thrown by the wayside or used solely for one or two reasons, and never heard from again. If thats not enough, because of these new angles, old ones built up from the first two, such as the triangle between Jean, Wolverine, and Cyclops, and the potential sparks that flew with Strom and Nightcrawler, are NOWHERE TO BE FOUND!!!!!! last but not least, since this is supposedly the last movie you would think that all questions would be answered, but instead of ending like that, the movie throws us for a loop, and ends with unresolved issues that only bring up more questions. I think they lied, and if there is a 4th (which, if they don't want to be hung, there should be) they will have a lot of explaining to do.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
In Need of the Cure,"I have the luxury of not being a fan of the comics, so I find no offense when some character's superpowers or origin don't match the ""book."" Also, I have seen enough Marvel-licensed projects to set my expectations low. In short, I was expecting almost nothing.The first two X-men were poor projects, but at least had *some* imagination. Sadly, it wasn't visual or cinematic. This lacks everything, but you can read all about that elsewhere. Here, all you'll find is some speculation about the root of thing: why it is rotten and probably unfixable at the core.The book depended on a the universality of differentness. The idea behind the notion of ""mutant"" was that there were perhaps tens of millions of mutants including nearly every reader. Different, strange but talented beyond the norm in some usually unappreciated way. Spurned or at least misunderstood by parents and bosses.In this cosmology, we all live in a modified noir world, one that toys with the fate of a whole class rather than a single, accidentally selected individual (and his girl). When we see higher level mutants behaving heroically, they do it as representatives of us, or so the comics go.That's turned on its head here: lower level mutants are innocent pawns just as all the other types of people, soldiers, random motorists  whose idea was it to show that every car had children in it, then use those occupied cars as firebombs?And if the target demographic is 14 year old boys and those who wish they were, why use 40 year old women? Or is it not supposed to matter? Well, it didn't to me, but the complete lack of cinematic imagination says this needs to go away.The anti-mutating mutant was apt, though.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good X-Men movie but a minor disappointment.,"X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) is a good superhero movie, but way down than the first two films were. It wasn't a bad film that would be Days of Future Past and Origins Wolverine I just like this film a lot of better then the new X-Men films.Well I love it. It is my favorite movie of all X-Men. People who criticize this movie and saying bad things about it seriously get the hell out of my face and you don't get it at all. [:To me it was a great movie and I love it. I love the new mutants they are more mutants. At the end they are all six mutants. I am a fan of Wolverine and Storm. I love when Wolverine was fighting against mutants and Magneto's army in the woods he come back for Jean Phoenix. Than they find a cure against mutants to become a humans again it was a little boy and Magneto wanted him dead. The fight scene between Pyro and iceman was fantastic. Pyro was with Professor X in the second movie but than he cross the line and he become magneto's alley. Mystique become human again after one cop throw on Magneto the cure and she saved him. What Magneto did? He throw her away because she was a human and he said she is not one of them anymore.So Mystique betrayed magneto and she told authorities were is Magneto's hide out. ""Hell has no fury like a women scorned."" Jean Phoenix did died at the end of the second movie but she come back in this one. Wolverine loved her more than Cyclops actually did. It was sad that he had to killed her at the end but she was a treat to all of us. The first appearance of Henry 'Hank' McCoy / Beast he was never mentioned in the first two movies. I love the finale battle, they are more mutants in this one, than they were in the first two movies. Final conclusion and end to the trilogy. Wolverine stays at the school at the end without professor X I really love it. I know a lot of people will say that I am stupid for liking this movie. And I am really not a big comic book fan of this movie because I don't know everything but I really love it. But is not my best favorite movie.X-Men: The Last Stand has a few put holes and errors: Like death of Professor X the return of Phoenix from the grave when she died at the end of the second movie. Mysterious death of Scott Summers Cyclops. I also don't think that he is dead, there was no body and he does also not do anything in this movie. Than Rouge,she doesn't fly she doesn't even fight. All she does is complaining and waning about been a mutant and not been a human. She is useless here. The third installment into the trilogy, is a good film in their own way. But not my best favorite movie. That would be X2 and than is X-Men because, it is the first movie I watch in the summer 2001 on tape and it is the second best one for me. X2: X-Men United is better than both of them together but to me are all three good one of the X-Men trilogy.What could have been an epic conclusion to the X-trodinary trilogy, was a minor disappointment, Gone is Byran Singer who left the project to direct Superman Returns, in comes Bret (I only work with Jackie Chan) Ratner. He's OK, but he's no Singer. It also sucks that characters you care for get killed off in such un-ethical ways. Oh well. It is not the film that people except but is not by the worst one for me. I love action and this is a science fiction, action flick. It has a lot of changes which it sucks but it is still an enjoyable flick.Experience the awesome power of The X-Men's epic, final battle. Join well-known mutant heroes and villains, and meet a cadre of all-new warriors -- including Angel, Beast, Juggernaut and Colossus -- in this thrilling, explosive adventure! After a controversial cure is discovered, mutants can choose to retain their superhuman abilities or give up their unique gifts and become normal. When peaceful mutant leader Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) clashes with his militant counterpart, Magneto (Ian McKellen), the battle lines are drawn for the war to end all wars. Bursting with nonstop action and spectacular special effects, X-Men The Last Stand is a force of nature that will blow you away!I am sorry if you disagree with me.

Singer's Mistake,"If -like me- you liked the first two X-Men movies, and lowered your expectations for this one because of Bryan Singer's departure, you're correct.Simply put, the director's switch was a bad move for both camps. I don't think Singer will add anything to Superman we haven't seen before and Brett Ratner can't keep up with the expectations set on the former two X-Men Movies.Didn't help the plot tried to grab more than it could chew on. Too many story lines and too little time to develop them all. Main characters die and lose their power without adding drama or urgency. Other characters are introduced without a backstory. The one that has some backstory (Angel) is almost a cameo. With this movie, one of my fears from the comic book came true: There were so many mutants at one point I lost track of them. But, Jackman and McKellen carry the movie as they did in the other two. Fortunately.Add also the poor decision of giving up more story development for bombast. This movie mainly goes for apocalyptic, and totally unrealistic fighting scenes between the good guys and the bad guys, as if trying to show off the big budget the movie had for special effects.Yet still, it manages to entertain, so it's not a lost case. The problem is, with Ratner the focus is on entertainment, when Singer focus is on delivering a message first. And that's the main difference between this X-Men movie and the other two.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"flawed, in the way you'd likely expect with the 3-timer","I wanted to like X-Men the Last Stand more than I ended up doing, but it goes without saying that the film does lend itself to a certaincase of style going triumphant over substance, it just is. There is an unspoken trend in sequels where the third film 9 times out of 10 is the weakest of the bunch (even if it may not be necessarily a very bad movie). It's a little sad in a way too to see a director like Brett Ratner- who is admittedly by many including myself not as good with the material as Bryan Singer- get pushed aside by a studio far more interested in the action over the substance. And it's unfortunately Do the new mutants look cool? Sure, some of them; it's one of the more amusing things to see this year in a blockbuster having Kelsey Grammar and Vinnie Jones as mutants with over-the-top make-up and costumes. And the special effects and action scenes are given as good, but not having the same real interest as in the past films. Moments in these action sequences- mainly in the wild climax at Alcatraz prison- are exciting, but the problems in the film run deeper than that. If you don't have things all well enough in the script, things are liable to fall apart.One might think that the main plot line of the film, with Famke Janssen as Jean Gray's unbalance and quasi turn to the dark side of the mutant force (maybe just me seeing the 'Sith' comparisons), and the amount of tragedy that befalls the mutants under Xavier's school would make it a very engrossing entertainment. It isn't; there is the feeling more than anything that too much is stuffed into one film, where some sub-plots are left to being undercooked (i.e. the one with Michael Murphy and his winged son), or just given to a lack of creativity (the sub-plot with Anna Paquin's Rogue doesn't have much to it that isn't a mile away). Would I recommend the film as leave-your-brain-at-home-frozen to watch the film? Yeah, but it isn't much of a credit that it's lacking in the ways that would matter to most fans and just movie-goers in general. It will make a lot of money, that is certain, but it will also suffer in time from the good of the film (dependence on the cast like McKellan, Stewart, a couple of newer faces among so-so ones too) contending against the disappointing bits. As one critic somewhere wrote about this film, it's ""soul-less"", which is not what this potential material should have, and has me feeling less wanting to see it again the more I think about it.

A Nutshell Review: X-Men: The Last Stand,"As always, you get the beef here - stay tuned until the end of the  credits for one small scene which will probably put a smile to your  face. Don't say I didn't warn ya! Oh and as usual with good Marvel  movies, watch out for Stan Lee too!  The X-Men movies did one thing which I thought was almost impossible to  do for the movies, and that is to massage the multi-characters' egos  into one feature length film within reasonable screen time. Kudos are  necessary for Bryan Singer and his team for pulling the original X-Men  off, then top it with X2, beating odds that sequels generally suck,  what with bigger sets, action, and horrors, even more characters!  With Singer's departure for another summer movie this year, the grand  daddy of superheroes, Superman, the X-Men franchise was temporarily put  into development hell, and was left directionless. Having its stars ask  for more money and a bigger role, was natural too. But I'm glad that  these issues were resolved and director Brett Ratner took on the  thankless task of adding a rudder to steer a fitting last movie of a  trilogy (will there be more? Hmm....)  And I'm glad to announce it's the best summer movie so far, one which  surpassed my expectations, which probably was low to begin with. It had  a decent storyline which is a direct continuation from X2, and had  bleak moments interspersed throughout the movie. A cure has been found,  extracted from a fellow mutant boy, which the humans offer to the  mutants to become normal again. But just what is normal? Herein lies  the ra-ra themes like you-are-who-you-are, stay-true-to-yourself etc.  But it doesn't bog down the pace of the movie, not quite, especially  since most will be in it for the action. And it's always human tendency  to want to weaponize anything for that advantage over our enemies. We  come in peace? Hell yeah :P  There are again plenty of set action pieces, some of which will  disappoint, like the beginning which somewhat reeked from a bad  Terminator setting, but on the other end of the spectrum, the Grey  House battle is the best amongst all, beating even the finale. It's  full of concurrent action, tense moments, loads of special effects with  a dash of character development. The finale battle was cool (look out  for the Iceman teaser), but I thought it was a bit of a letdown with  its major continuity error with the cars on the bridge.  Not surprisingly, having Hugh Jackman and Halle Berry's names  headlining the marquee, Wolverine (as always, the most popular  X-character) and Storm had more leadership roles in this sequel. But,  and no offense to the fans, it seemed that Wolverine's solo action  sequence was a bit ordinary, like watching a scene from Mortal Kombat.  If there's gonna be a movie spin off, show off more slicing and dicing,  up the violence a little and slap it with some rating.  But with the focus on the 2 main leads, as well as The Beast, little  attention is paid towards Magneto and his brotherhood (then again, we  need not have much introduction and can afford diving straight in), and  fans of Mystique will be disappointed with the diminished role, as do  other characters like Rogue, Cyclops and new kid on the block Angel  (really cosmetic if you ask me).  The Phoenix was introduced to great fanfare, and it made a bit more  sense without the fusion of that outer space element from the comics.  This story-arc is the main pivot, and it was a fantastic scene in the  beginning to witness the camaraderie between Charles Xavier and Eric  Lensherr, before they became bitter enemies. I'd tip my hat too to the  little moments of acknowledgement and admiration one has for the other,  despite being on opposites.  All in all, it was very much enjoyable, and I'm sure fans of the movie  franchise will agree it's a fitting end to the trilogy, though it  hinted the option of making a fourth, and the more lucrative potential  of solo character spin offs.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Divisive Chapter....Good but still.....Disappointed,"*X-Men: The Last Stand* is a film that polarized fans and critics alike. While it boasts ambitious storytelling and impressive visual effects, it also suffers from pacing issues, uneven character development, and a rushed climax.The film introduces a high-stakes premise: a ""cure"" for mutant abilities. This concept sparks a moral dilemma within the mutant community, dividing the X-Men and creating a compelling conflict. Magneto's radical response to this threat adds a layer of complexity to the narrative.However, the film struggles to balance multiple storylines, resulting in a rushed and fragmented feel. The introduction of the Phoenix Saga element, while ambitious, is not fully realized and ultimately feels underutilized. The character of Jean Grey, once a powerful and complex figure, becomes overshadowed by the Phoenix entity.Despite its flaws, *X-Men: The Last Stand* delivers some memorable moments. The battle sequences are visually stunning, and the performances of the core cast, particularly Ian McKellen as Magneto, remain strong. The film's exploration of themes of acceptance, fear, and the nature of humanity is also commendable.Ultimately, *X-Men: The Last Stand* is a film with untapped potential. While it offers glimpses of greatness, it fails to fully capitalize on its ambitious premise. It remains a divisive entry in the franchise, with some fans finding it a satisfying conclusion to the original trilogy, while others view it as a missed opportunity.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"No character development, no heart, lots of 'Splosions.","What a disappointment. I'm not a comic-book fan, but I did really like the first two films. This one was all loud banging. I know people like special effects (part of the reason I wanted to see it), but I like to think people also like story and character development and real suspense. Even the action was murky. It's almost impossible to see what the Beast is doing when he's fighting, it's just a big, ugly blur there's no choreography whatsoever. Plus, Magneto's a very smart guy, a leader, and yet his demise is brought on by one of these ""oldest trick in the book"" routines. Every time a mutant uses a power, it seems to be in a very convenient situation. Everything's staged so simply that you can see it all coming from a mile away. I felt insulted on behalf of movie-goers everywhere. Bring back Brian Singer, he won't phone-in his duty. Brett Ratner should never work in the business again.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
One too many storyline,"This is the last of the original live action trilogy. A consortium of drug companies have found a cure for mutants and this sets off a fight from the Brotherhood led by Magneto (Ian McKellen). Meanwhile Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), dead at the end of last movie, returns as Phoenix in her place. She is now an infinitely more powerful mutant. Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) must stop both Phoenix and Magneto.There is too much going on in this movie. There is basically one too many story lines in this. The cure storyline is great on its own. There are parallels to the real world. There are built-in conflicts. There are deep moral divisions that are only skimmed at. Jean Grey's storyline just adds too much complications. It confuses everything and is done really poorly. Her story could have been her own separate movie. That would be a better idea. Jean Grey has her own movie with Wolverine. It's certainly a better Wolverine movie than anything they've made. There are other issues like Magneto's wrong-headed motivation. This is still somewhat fun but with issues.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Disappointing, shallow effort.","I was surprised by how this movie just doesn't hold up. Lots of small, and shallow bits of plot leading up to the inevitable fight. There was no depth anywhere, formulaic and without a single twist that couldn't be seen a mile off. It felt more like a collection of cut-scenes in a video game. Angel came, and went. Didn't need to be there, and without any character development we were given no reason to care if he was, or wasn't.

laaaaaaaame.,"I am a huge X-Men fan, loved the comics, the cartoon show on TV, and loved the first movie and the second one was incredibly amazing. However, while X-Men: The Last Stand was quite entertaining (the fight scenes were generally well-done), it was LAME. The dialogue was lacking. Anything that was meant to be a smart one-liner fell short. I think the only time anyone really laughed was when someone got nicked in the nuts. I was a little disappointed that the third X-Men did not live up to the previous movies' standards.Also, just as a little sidenote, in this movie, it always seemed to me that anytime anyone flew, they tried to build it up too much, with empowering music, and it just turned out...cheesy almost. So that was kind of a bummer.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A great movie,"Okay. Before I saw this movie, I had read numerous reviews on it. Some said that it was bad. Some said said that it was good. I had to make my own assumption. After seeing it, I can honestly say I loved X-Men The Last Stand. Yes the story was kinda simple and the characters weren't as fleshed out as in the other two X-Men movies, but it was great nonetheless. It did have some other downsides to it. The main one I think was that it didn't follow the comic book closely. But don't be nitpicking the entire movie otherwise you're not going to have a fun time. Just go there and watch the movie. It also left way for maybe a sequel or two (I'm not going to spoil anything. Just watch after the credits). It was a fitting end to this X-men trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A sloppy end to what could have been an awesome trilogy,"X-Men 3:The Last Stand was undoubtedly an entertaining film, but for all its visual marvel and its maelstrom of explosive action sequences, it fails to be brilliant for one reason; there is too much going on.It picks up sometime (we're to assume recently) after the supposed death of psychic Jean Grey. While her friends and colleagues Wolverine and Storm are trying to cope without her, they become gripped by the news that the human government has found a way to suppress the mutant gene and is opening its doors to any mutant who wishes to relinquish their powers and achieve a normal status in society. However, right-wing mutant fundamentalist, Magneto, rejects the so called ""cure"" as an insult and with the help of an army of vengeful mutants, rises up against the humans who, as it turns out, are planing to enforce the cure with or without mutant consent. Meanwhile Scott (aka Cyclops) revisits the dam where he last saw his beloved wife swept away by a wall of water. She mysteriously reappears, not as the Jean he once knew, but as the ferociously powerful goddess, Phoenix...can you see how this creates a problem?As comic book purists have already vehemently pointed out, the Phoenix saga stretches over four episodes! So it makes me wonder how any scriptwriter would believe that they could successfully crush such a huge legacy into a 100 min film, while also trying to accommodate the inevitable Magneto Vs Humans war and still have time to build tangible, three-dimensional characters along the way. How could Ratner hope to do that when his movie is half an hour shorter than the his predecessor's?Between the X-Men, Magneto's goons, the White House officials, the US army and the malevolent Phoenix, the movie becomes a wild battle for screen time. Many of the more prominent and intriguing characters from the first two films taste barely two minutes of the running time before they are either stripped of their powers, or destroyed. It was a most unsavoury feeling for me to see characters who I had become so attached to over the course of the last two films, suddenly being recklessly obliterated. Save for the character of Beast, played excellently by Kelsey Grammar, virtually none of the new mutants introduced actually speak a word. We are told absolutely nothing about them and we must accept that they serve no purpose other than to blast energy bolts, kick people in the face and make things explode. It was a let down, almost an insult to watch this mass mistreatment of so many important characters.The visual effects in this film are amazing, most notably the hair-raising (or should I say ""house-raising"") scene with Phoenix and Xavier in the Grey House, the destruction and flight of the Golden Gate Bridge and the explosive showdown between the X-men and Magneto's forces, which displayed some truly breathtaking scenes.However, when Ratner's not directing action his inferiority to Singer shows through. X3 feels like a much more static and plainer looking film than its predecessors. This is mainly down to Ratner's camera work lacking the polished, dynamic genius of Singer's, who gave the first two films a real comic book feel. Ratner also tends to indulge in the special effects bucket all too much, unlike Singer who used a more subtle approach. There's only so much razzle-dazzle that you can throw at an audience, if yeh don't got the script or the characters...it's gonna fall flat.The actors all do a brilliant job, even if some of the best actors are only on screen for five minutes! Famke Jackson plays the Phoenix with frightening charisma (although she was helped greatly by black contacts and pulsing thread veins). Hugh Jackman seems to fit right at home as the rustic, rippling anti-hero Wolverine. Hally Berry's role as Storm seemed strange. Apparantley after plans to leave she told writers she would stay on only if they extended her role. I can see how she was 'upgraded' to the status of leader, but she still seemed to take the back seat behind Wolverine. On a negative note, I thought the casting of Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut was just stupid. I don't remember Juggernaut ever sounding like an cockney boot boy.X3 was indeed a loud, cheesy, epileptic romp that was, for the most part, enjoyable. It's just so unfortunate that it tried to take on too much at once and had to sacrifice so many great characters. If only they hadn't caged themselves with this trilogy idea and had dealt with the Phoenix saga and Magneto's war as two separate films.As a movie on its own, Ratner's X3 is acceptable. However, as the conclusion to a trilogy, it is thoroughly empty and disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Honestly, A Waste of Time","You know what, Ellen Page was great as Kitty Pryde. And the scene with her and Juggernaut was fun in a way most of this film wasn't. I also liked the Angel character's introduction. Something the other X Movies gave us in abundance. What else was good? Ian Mckellan as Magneto. And the set-up was fantastic. What's that 15 minutes of the movie? Beast was decently realized, but he ate up screen time without adding much to the film.The bad... everything else. Action scenes lacked smarts. The clockwork showdown between Pyro & Iceman, against all logic, fizzled out due to lack of breathing room. Especially ill conceived was the decision to have the ""Good vs. Evil""-which-color-will-win battle? Who asked for more Halle Berry as Storm?? While her acting isn't as unbearable as the last two films, her role in the story is so small, that devoting so much screen time to her seems like a braindead move. Also braindead? Including the Dark Phoenix. That's a second trilogy right there. It's just too much too soon. And there's already a perfectly good story built into The Last Stand: The cure. That brings things full circle.Folks, I wouldn't be so harsh if there hadn't been a great set-up. This is still decent Summer Popcorn movie fare. The point is, the first two movies were so much more. The Last Stand is like a carefully planted garden that was just starting to sprout, when someone decided to build a hotdog stand on the spot. You may like hotdogs, but they won't quench your soul.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Characters overruled by action sequences,"After director Bryan Singer decided to leave the X-Men series in order to direct the new Superman film, many feared that the third instalment would not be as great as the first two. Unfortunately, replacement director Brett Ratner has only confirmed those fears, as while the film features all the action that would expect from a comic book movie; the characterisation that put Singer's film above a lot of comic book fare has been lost, as new blood such as Ben Foster's Angel and Vinnie Jones' Juggernaut aren't given much to do, and established characters such as Mystique and Cyclops get left by the wayside. The plotting doesn't work as well as in previous films either, as Simon Kinberg & Zak Penn's script tries to do too much, and the result is a film the leaves several threads hanging far too long before returning to them; and the result ultimately is a film that doesn't explore every possible angle. The plot this time largely focuses on the idea of a cure for mutancy, which divides the population between those that want to be cured, and those that don't. One again, the major story point features the battle between Professor Xavier and evil genius, Magneto.To be honest, I've never read the X-Men comics; and so can't comment on the faithfulness to the source material. I don't imagine writing a script for this film would be easy, as there's so many different characters and keeping the focus away from special effects is a near impossibility. The special effects are impressive, but not as much as they could have been simply due to the fact that astounding effects have become part and parcel of the modern day blockbuster. The film does feature several action scenes, which are sure to delight the target audience, however, and although certain scenes; including one that involves the golden bridge, are somewhat over the top - that's hardly a weighty criticism for a comic book film. The dynamics of the story have changed, as Halle Berry's storm takes a more frontal role this time around, which is a shame as it means other, more interesting characters such as Anna Paquin's Rogue barely get any screen time at all (the white hair looks great on Berry, though). Ian McKellen stands out as the leader of the wayward mutants, and is gifted with the best character in the film. Hugh Jackman fits his role as Wolverine like a glove; while Famke Janssen and Kelsey Grammar do nothing but fill out the plot with their roles. The amazing Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is given nothing to do, which is a major flaw as far as I'm concerned while younger stars such as Shawn Ashmore, Aaron Stanford and Ellen Page do well in the action sequences but don't shine otherwise. Ex-football star Vinnie Jones is great only when his mouth is closed.I'm sure that this film will appeal to fans of the comic book, as despite several painful one-liners and a lack of characterisation, the film is very entertaining and the action sequences are largely well done. In comparison to the first two movies, The Last Stand doesn't stand out and it's a shame that a series with so much promise had to end on what can only be described as a low.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not as good as the first two,"First of all, I would like to say that I was a huge fan of the first two ""X-Men"" movies. Although they could have very well have been big, loud, dumb action movies with none of the sophisticated and intelligent themes of the comics, director Bryan Singer took them and turned them into intelligent sci-fi allegories for intolerance and acceptance. While the main plot of ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is interesting and makes for some good philosophical debates, it makes the mistake of focusing far more on comic book-style action rather than the intelligent sci-fi of the first two films in addition to biting off far more than it can chew.The main plot deals with the invention of a serum that permanently suppresses the x-gene in mutants, thereby making them human. This is advertised by its inventors as a cure for the mutant situation, which naturally raises the ire of both the X-Men and the much more militant Magneto. While some mutants welcome the ""cure"" as a way to rid themselves of mutations that are more of a curse, others see it as just another way for humans to control and eventually exterminate mutants. One character states that being a mutant cannot be cured, which creates an interesting parallel to some real-life ""problems"" such as homosexuality and the belief that they are diseases that need to be cured or controlled. This is some fascinating stuff, and as long as the movie sticks to this premise and the extreme reactions it invokes in the characters the movie manages to be smarter than your typical summer fare.The film also deals with another fascinating subplot. Jean Grey, who was apparently killed at the end of ""X2,"" has risen from the dead and now is more powerful than any other mutant on Earth. She has manifested a new very destructive personality that calls itself Phoenix, and she is apparently powerful enough to be an even bigger threat to both humans and mutants than Magneto or the cure could ever be. She doesn't hold back with her powers whenever she's in Phoenix mode, and she is downright frightening whenever she uses them. A movie about the Phoenix becoming the ultimate in human evolution and therefore the biggest threat to the human race would've been a great way to end this franchise (it had its own lengthy storyline years ago in the ""X-Men"" comics), but here it becomes nothing more than a subplot that appears pretty much when the director decides when we should see more people being blasted into subatomic particles. With as frightening and as powerful as Jean becomes here, one could easily argue that the Phoenix subplot deserves its own movie.Like I said, this movie seemed to bite off far more than it could chew, and not just in the way it handles two concepts that each need their own movie to be fully explored. There are just too many interesting characters that don't get the screen time and development that they deserve. I would've loved to see the continuation of the Cyclops/Jean Grey/Wolverine love triangle in the form of the two men trying to reach Jean while at the same time being at odds because they're both in love with her. I would've loved to see more of the scientist that creates the mutant serum and how he simply wants to cure his mutant son's ""disease."" For that matter, I would've loved to see more of the son, who is reduced to nothing more than a cool visual. I would've loved to see more of the Iceman/Rogue/Kitty love triangle, and how it might influence Rogue's decision to seek out the cure. None of this is explored very fully, so we are sadly left with a bunch of missed opportunities.It may sound that I'm doing nothing but trashing on this movie, but the truth is that, despite its obvious flaws, there's still a lot to like. The acting is as good as it was in the previous two installments, with Ian McKellen being the obvious stand-out. Magneto is clearly the villain of this movie, but he's a villain that the audience can actually get behind thanks to McKellen's commanding performance. He can be downright nasty, but he also comes off as very wise and even respectful to his enemies (one line that he has in regards to Professor Xavier carries a lot of weight, especially when one takes into account the friendship that the two men once had). Other standouts include Hugh Jackman (who now seems to be playing Wolverine as someone who has grown from being a somewhat volatile loner to a team player to a potential leader of the X-Men), and Kelsey Grammar as Dr. Hank McCoy (or The Beast, as he is known to fans of the comic), who provides plenty of charm and wit even underneath layers of blue fur. Finally, the action scenes and special effects are possibly the best of the trilogy; the completely insane battle between the X-Men and just about everyone else that makes up most of the film's third act is almost reason enough to see the movie.In the end, this is definitely more of a typical summer blockbuster than the first two ""X-Men"" films, but I don't think 20th Century Fox realizes that the reason why so many people like those films is because they're not typical summer blockbusters. They are actually very smart and sophisticated, which is exactly what good sci-fi should be. ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is definitely a good comic book-style action movie, but it doesn't have the sophistication and subtlety of the previous two films.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I saw Avi Arad at Wizards a couple years ago when he was promoting the soon to be released ""Fantastic 4"" At the time the director was not sure yet, and he was asked if X-Men would suffer without the direction of Bryan Singer, he seemed to be annoyed with the questions and said ""The story of the X-Men surpasses any Director.""

"X3: The Last Stand entertains, but is further more quite easy digested.","Poor Bret Rattner. Everyone has been so skeptical about him directing X3. And yes, I'll admit that The Last Stand doesn't get marvelous during the modest running time of 104 minutes. However, I will not blame it all on Rattner. He does his job very fine. More I would like to criticize the writers, Simon Kinberg and Zak Penn who deliver quite a weak story. Simple with no actual twists, no specific moments standing out, which I think this movie definitely misses. Something extraordinary is not there. Yes, you are able to feel when the climax rises, but still it's like it is not really there. To all this, especially the one liners seem to lack importance. Lots of them just appear to immediately vanish in the haze. Therefor my vote mainly goes to the exposure of the characters and their astounding skills. Utilising the amazing CGI effects, the film, however, does achieve some beautiful moments, where you cannot hide your satisfaction and have to critically acclaim it. So don't go in there with the highest expectations, but prepare yourself for 104 minutes of entertainment, where you most likely are going to miss something, but where you at least don't start to nod off.

"X3 Disappoints, but is Still Enjoyable","I want so much to say ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" was completely awesome, and that it rocked my socks, but unfortunately the film disappointed me. Clocking in at only 105 minutes, it seemed very rushed, and confusing at times. Also, the characters- and some awesome new mutants- got barely any screen time, and were not fleshed out at all. It's strange because ""X2"" was 133 minutes and was all about Wolverine/Logan trying to discover who he is, and where he came from. It was a character driven movie, but in this film we find out nothing more about him or any of the mutants.In ""X3"" a cure has been found for mutation and the mutants become divided. Some welcome the cure so they can become ""normal"", and others are angry that they would even think of trying to cure them. The latter is led by Magneto (a brilliant Ian McKellen) who decides to destroy all who oppose mutation. He gathers himself an army, and it's up to Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his small band of heroes to stop Magneto.Some of the acting and dialogue were corny, and a few scenes had the audience- including me- laughing out loud at the sheer stupidity of some scenes. Monkeys at a keyboard, I tell ya. Jeesh. It wasn't all bad, heavens no. There are just some things that severely disappointed me, and will upset any hardcore fans. Kelsey Grammar as Dr. Hank McCoy/Beast is awesome, especially when he battles the baddies. Vinnie Jones as Juggernaut, who is also a cool new addition, delivers a line that had the audience roaring with laughter. And of course, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine always steals the movies he's in. Plus Wolverine's claws rock! One other thing I didn't like was the music; it never seemed to fit the scene quite well, like the composer wrote the music before the movie was finished. But of course, the F/X and the action were great. And even though some dialogue was bad, some were hilariously good. New director Brett Ratner (the ""Rush Hour"" films) added some great humor to the film. I do wish Bryan Singer who directed the other two did this one, but he opted to do ""Superman Returns"" instead, which stands to reason.Overall, the first and second ""X-Men"" were a million times better, and this one failed in a way. Though it is still good summer fare, and enjoyable for the most part.I give it 6 out of 10. (I wish I could give it a higher score, I really do.)

(Nightcrawler anyone?)However, I must give it some credit- the movie isn't as bad as it could've been, and in seeing it I didn't feel like I had wasted my money.Check it out, but wait for a matinée or the DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X3 The Last Stand stands tall...,"Bryan Singer has abandoned the X Men to tackle Superman instead so Brett Ratner stepped in and took the helm. Ironically Rattner was once up for this year's Superman so it's funny that he and Singer have traded films in a manner of speaking.Contrary to initial fears and rumors X3 is not trashy but has loads of action a good, solid storyline with all your favorite X Men back and a plot packed with some surprising turns of events. The basic story premise is that the government has found a way to eliminate in other words ""cure"" the mutant X gene thus eliminating mutants from society by turning them into regular human beings. Although humans and mutants have now learned to coexist this newly propagated cure is reason for Magneto (Ian McKellen) to mount an offensive and wage a war on humans in ""a fury the world has never seen..""Rattner has improved on the pacing which in my opinion was but the only fault of X2 keeping a steady balance between character exposition, action and humor. The production quality such as special effects, camera and sound mix is first rate; aside from the established cast Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin there are some new mutant entries Kelsey Grammar as ""The Beast"" aka secretary for mutant affairs, Vinnie Jones as ""The Juggernaut"" and Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde, a young girl who can walk through walls and serves as Rogue's rival love interest for Bobby.The best acting, however, belongs to Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and most of all to Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto). McKellen who happened to be the best part of this year's abysmal DaVinci Code is quite the scene stealer in X3 portraying a smart, calm yet lethal villain, who happens to come across quite sympathetic.In a nutshell: finally a nice, solid good summer blockbuster - good entertainment!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Enjoyable But Lacking Depth,"29 May 2006. This third installment while enjoyable as summer action-thriller entertainment lacks the emotional, dramatic, and empathic, psychological compelling storyline. The characters are not given much opportunity to develop the critical possibilities that this storyline could have tapped into. Magneto had the best emotional conflict on display while the rest of the characters were only given lines that scratched the surface. The special effects, the pacing, the action were riveting. Unlike the earlier two X-Men movies, the inner haunting conflicts were submerged while the action took on a more prominent role. The demise of several major characters follows the script that the television series 24 took this past year substituting dramatic personal disaster in lieu of the more subtle, difficult personal turmoil of more qualitatively satisfying movies that even Spiderman movie scripts contained. Nevertheless, this most recent X-Men provide the typical clash between good and evil with man in the middle with reasonably satisfying results. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Could have been stronger in the detail but is still a superior summer blockbuster,"When an American pharmaceutical company carrying out research on one very unique mutant discovers a method of producing a ""cure"" for the mutant x gene, the effect on the mutant community is dramatic. Some embrace the drug in order to become ""normal"", others protest the view that they have a disease that needs curing while others take a stand, seeing the drug as the first strike in a war. On the side of diplomacy are Professor Charles Xavier and his school for mutants; on the other is Magneto who is drawing his own army around him. The sides start to form while, although the government claims the drug will be voluntary, a weapons grade version is supplied to the army.The second sequel in the X-Men series has a title that suggests that it is perhaps the last. This may or may not be the case but the story suggests it is and it is as good a way as any to tie up what has generally been a collection of superior summer blockbusters. I was worried about the loss of Bryan Singer and even more so about his replacement with Brett Ratner but whether or not this is the cause of some of the weaknesses I can't say. I'll get onto my problems with it in a minute but they are not insurmountable and I actually really enjoyed the film on the level that many summer movies pitch themselves  special effects driven entertainment and action. However with this film (and indeed the series) there are more than just the bangs and the material offers much food for thought. In terms of the former aspect the action is great fun, looks great and is well spread out over the whole running time.Unfortunately the promise in the material isn't produced that well to compliment the action. The lines are blurred in this drama  we can see points in both mutant camps that we agree and disagree with while we also understand the human response. The ethics of it is well presented and is added to with lots of other plot lines and character issues  although this might be the problem, it is trying to do too much in a short time and, as a result, doesn't excel in any one thing even if it does many reasonably well. Having said that though, it is still much more interesting than many summer action movies I've seen over recent years. As director Ratner always seems more comfortable with the big action scenes and therefore doesn't offer much help to the interesting stuff in the script; this wasn't a surprise and at least he is good at what he does well.The cast is perhaps a bit too baggy (although the story helps solve that problem to a degree) but everyone is good. McKellen and Stewart are as reliable as ever in their characters and bring a lot of dignity to their material. Jackman is good but perhaps over familiar with his character  still good though and a solid lead. Berry has a small role with little to do and she is very much in the shadow of Janssen who is interesting even if her presence is part of the film having too much to do. Grammar is well cast. Paquin is the best of the young cast  others like Ashmore, Page, Stanford and others are OK but are less memorable.Overall this is a good summer action movie with good material, performances and action. It maybe isn't as strong as it could have been in different hands and with a tighter focus, but it is still a superior summer blockbuster and a strong end (?) to a generally strong series.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This is just one fun ride. And right from the start (a few minutes in maybe), Ratner let's you know, that anything goes!

Wimpy conclusion to the trilogy,"Flawed film. Hiring Brett Ratner was not an inspired choice. The action scenes lack any momentum, and characters are killed off with little satisfaction for us fanboys. Arch Angel is only here to service one story beat, that is not strong enough or even worthwhile. The storyline betrays characters and in the end It's one anti climatic disappointment. Singer was the key to the series and he abandoned ship. The lack of a key filmmaker and messy storyline can't save this.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"This movie was good, but a little disappointing","In 'X-Men: The Last Stand' a 'cure' has been developed to inhibit the x-gene that causes mutations in Homo sapiens. This, in essence has the ability to turn Homo superiors (mutants) into Homo sapiens. The development in this inhibitor all hinges on extracting it from the mutant Leech (Cameron Bright). While some mutants are encouraged by the 'cure', most are not. Magneto (Ian McKellen) is dead set on destroying it by any means necessary. Right or wrong, the X-men have to stop him before he unleashes his army.This movie was good, but a little disappointing. I like that we get a glimpse of the Sentinels. They take some artistic license with the comic plot line, which is to be expected, but they did a lot of things I did not like. There are casualties (I am not going to say who) that make no sense and some of the character portrayals were also disappointing.Most did really well. I really liked Storm (Halle Berry), Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), and Beast (Kelsey Grammar). I did not like Rouge (Anna Paquin), Pyro (Aaron Stanford), Callisto (Dania Ramirez), and Phoenix (Famke Janssen).

You would die for them?,"X-Men: The Last Stand is directed by Brett Ratner and written by Simon Kinberg & Zak Penn. It's the second sequel to 2000's X-Men and the franchise is based around Uncanny X-Men that was the creation of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. It stars Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Ian McKellen, Famke Jansen, Kelsey Grammar, Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin & Ellen Page. Dante Spinotti photographs it and the music is scored by John Howe. Plot finds mutants in danger of being wiped out due to a cure discovered at Worthington Industries. This could have desperate repercussions between Xavier's integration friendly X-Men, Magneto's human hating Brotherhood and the human race. Things are further complicated with the return from the dead of Jean Grey, who seems to not be herself and has gained some new and terrifying powers...Bryan Singer, director of the first two X-Men film's, left the franchise to go and helm Superman Returns. After much toing and froing, and many offers to directors, Ratner ended up in the chair. Director of Rush Hour 1 & 2 and Red Dragon, Ratner was charged with the unenviable task of trying to follow the excellent X2. Afforded a budget of $210 million (considerably the highest of the franchise), Ratner and his team made a good enough film to get double back that budget at the Worldwide box office. Not bad considering it was met with mixed reviews from the critics and fan-boys alike. X-Men 3 is a good film, in fact it's great entertainment, what it lacks is the flow and balance of its immediate predecessor. Ratner and his team have followed what seems to be the rule of thumb for movie franchises, i.e.: cram more in and try to dazzle as often as possible. Which in a film that only runs at just over 1 hour 40 minutes doesn't leave much opportunity for character depth, coherence and a solid structure. It's a shame that the makers couldn't afford to let the film be a two hour or longer piece, for there's enough in between the set-pieces to suggest that Ratner could have crafted a deeper movie to match the pizazz.But what pizazz it is. Magneto creates eye candy carnage via a rescue of one of his charges and a bit of bridge manoeuvring is really really cool. Then there's the sublime excitement that comes with the all out war of ""the last stand"", where the X-Men team go feral and showcase the best of their abilities and new tricks (oh we love Storm's new twirly spinning attack mode thingy). While Jean Grey's new powers brings breath taking rewards for the viewer. There's also plenty of little treats for fans of the source and one or two genuine surprises thrown into the mixer. But while the appearance of Beast (Grammer-great) and Kitty Pryde (Page-delightful) is most welcome, new additions that fall flat include Angel (Ben Foster-pointless) and Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones-laughable in a bad way). Which under scrutiny leaves us with a very mixed bag. But! And it's a very big but, for those looking for a slam bang popcorn piece this delivers all that's required. For those in hard with the source and those in need of X2's intelligence, however, the flaws may be just too much to bear. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Decent Final Installment,"Decent final installment in a trilogy that never felt like it came together as a unified narrative. Clearly even the makers of the franchise felt lukewarm about continuing the story, since a couple of hooks at the very end hint at more movies that never materialized. Instead, the studio threw its resources at an origin trilogy and a bunch of movies about Wolverine because they figured everyone wanted to see more of Hugh Jackman's brawny chest.Ben Foster with wings is big plus, but why is he in literally only two scenes?And has Michael Murphy ever in his life played someone who's not smarmy?Kelsey Grammer's mutant power is that he sheds a lot, so there's that.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Dark Might Rises,"None of these movies are perfect, they all have things that can be viewed as weak spots, but when it comes to the original trilogy spanning from 2000 to 2006 here, the third and last one seems to be regarded as not only the worst in the trilogy but also some of the worst in the entire franchise and, more than that, one of the worst ""superhero/comic book to film adaptation"" movies ever.It relies heavier on visual effects than the two before, but the conflict here is bigger than in the two prior films, and having more visual effects here is only natural. That isn't a problem. What does deserve criticism isn't the quantity but the quality of the visual effects here. Some of them could have been better. But again, some of them, not all of them, and the visuals in general are not bad at all. There is nothing wrong with the cinematography here. So, visually, this isn't a bad movie. And as for the sounds, the music here beats ""X2"" from three years before with ease. Whether or not it beats the movie from 2000 is not that clear. But again, anyway, the package here isn't bad at all. So, if the movie is bad, then the contents have to be the problem, the plot. Is it bad, really?It raises the stakes about as high as the previous movie, and explores more of the histories behind some of the key characters. Also, it obviously follows in the footsteps of what came before even though the director is new. Also, matters of life and death get even more serious here. The world on screen grows shaky and both the heroes and the villains are tested to the point where some of them almost lose faith in what they have stood for this whole time.Magneto deserves a special comment. He is a villain, make no mistake, but there is tragedy to how he became what he is and how he does what he does. This much has been clear enough both in the first and the second of these movies. It is also clear in this one. But something is added now. He may have been a respected leader for the bad guys in these movies, he may have been followed, his authority may have been undisputed, but whoever has been allied with him this whole time has been there for their common cause. They were together because they were doing the same thing. And he would regard any of them as disposable units. Once rendered useless, he wouldn't hesitate to abandon them. He would also go as far as to sacrifice some of his own kind for what he believed to be the common good. But the only friend he's ever had is on the other side of the barricade. ""The Last Stand"" points this out in a way neither ""X-MEN"" nor ""X2"" did. And if it brings you to tears, it's only natural. It's designed to.Of course, one can rightfully criticize the plot for bearing some clear resemblance to the first of these films, but it is not a copy, not even close. The runtime could have been longer with how much is going on here and acting could have been better here and there, perhaps. But the story is there, and there is drama to it. The bad reputation this movie has may have something to do with the comic book material behind it, and that I can get. But it's only a problem if you've read the comic books or the movie makes no sense at all. I haven't read any comic books, I'm only interested in the movies, and with some weak spots this one has, it may be the weakest in the trilogy because there could have been more care to how it's made, but a bad movie in general, some of the worst third movies in trilogies and one of the worst superhero films, no, that I can't get behind.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good finale to the original trilogy,"I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant ""X"" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are also old friends, take highly contrasting positions. Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a ""Brotherhood of Mutants"" with a clear attitude of superiority. And, as they say, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality - ""X-Men"" (2000), ""X2: X-Men United"" (2003) and ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006).""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is generally well-regarded but has a very vocal segment of fans who revile it. This makes little sense since, despite having a new director, the film has the same tone and principle actors as the previous two and brings to culmination the ideas presented therein. Aside from the final fight between Magneto's Brotherhood and Xavier's X-Men we get the resurrection of Jean Grey and her struggle with the dark side of her psyche.Some complain of the deaths of two prominent characters, but how often are characters resurrected in comics? Isn't one significant character resurrected in this very film? Others complain about the supposed short runtime and lack of depth but X3 has the exact same runtime as the first film (104 minutes) and there's plenty of depth to mine, take Rogue's dilemma over taking a cure in order to have human intimacy, Phoenix's incredible inner conflict symbolizing the universal clash of flesh and spirit (id and super-ego), Cyclop's grief and astonishing discovery, Pyro's moral degeneration, Mystique's plight after getting kicked out of the Brotherhood and Wolverine's struggle to do the right thing despite his deep love, to name just six.On the downside, the big clash on Alcatraz Island feels routine and dull. They should've kept the focus on the Dark Phoenix, but the producers probably felt this would take away from the other characters, plus they wanted the clichéd big battle sequence. Nevertheless, there's enough good here to appreciate.GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
just plain spectacular (A+),"It's not just that this movie, directed by Brett Ratner believe it or not, is more chockablock with eye-popping effects and thrilling action sequences than the first two, though that's true. Nor that Ratner depicts more mutant super-powers, though that's true also. Rather, it's that there's a whole story here. ""X3"" starts fast, and springboards from the long-running Marvel Comics series in breath-taking ways. It's a multi-faceted tale with an emotional richness seldom associated with the phrase ""summer movie."" For good reason, we equate summer movies with empty, flash-bang exercises in computer-generated imagery and mindless action. But the writers here seem less interested in the action than the subtext: the effort by a high-handed majority to control and eradicate a minority it finds undesirable. The script examines the other side of that equation as well: the desire to strike back, to return hatred for hatred. Magneto, who believes that the mutants, rather than submit to discrimination or attempt peaceful coexistence, should use their powers to rise up and rule over humans. Not that this is a movie with a lot of touchy-feely talks about brotherhood. It's just that ""X3"" has more on its mind than super-powered butt-kicking. Still, there's no denying that those super-powers drive this film. This is what state-of-the-art special effects look like: the live-action version of the way comic books appear in your mind. That would be irrelevant, however, without a good story. But ""X3""'s script delivers, skillfully weaving together character, plot and action.

X Men: The Last Stand Review,"The switching of the directors in X2 and this movie is clearly shown, much like it did in the Harry Potter movies. This is a very good action movie, but without seeing the other movies this movie is hard to understand. Also, there are too many mutants in this movie, as apposed to the first where there were to little. Many of the mutants have very small parts, and they even leave out mutants that were a key part in the second. The battle scenes seemed less real then the ones in the other two and the special effects were much worse. The movie is a good ½hour shorter then the second and much less deep. Overall I give this 7/10 stars, it was a very good movie, but not as good as X2, and extremely choppy is some parts.

The best and the worst of the trilogy,"X men 3: The best and the worst of the trilogy. The film begins better than the others with a lot of potential and a strong emotional charge, which leads you to believe that the second act will be nail bitingly intriguing and the finale explosive. But as the dreadful storyline, which deviates from the cartoon and comic immensely, unfolds, we are left as bewildered and unsatisfied as a diner who has been able to smell the gourmet meal from the kitchen, but is served 'Jellied eels and a pint'.I feel that Ratner was a little out of his genre on this one. There was no real character development for any of our mutant heroes, who seemed to just pop in and out of the story whenever a fight scene was to commence, to the point where some of our favourite X men were just cameos. And hardly any of the social, humanitarian issues, which are paramount to the concept of the X men, are delved into.Jean Grey is found alive, though neither she nor Professor X are able to control her extraordinarily powerful alter ego, The Phoenix. The obvious opportunity doesn't escape Magneto's attention who steps in to make The Phoenix the newest addition to his mutant militants. The government have concocted a 'cure' for the mutant gene and now with The Phoenix on his side, Magneto and his cohorts endeavour to destroy this so called cure, which he believes the government are using to wipe out mutants everywhere. Wolverine defiantly goes after The Phoenix to rescue Jean from her dominance. All the conflicting factors come to a head when Magneto unleashes his evil forces on the government establishment holding the 'cure'. The X men regroup and set out to thwart Magneto. An all out action packed rumble between the military, Magneto's mutants and the X men set up the final showdown.If you are not a die hard fan of the comic or cartoon you may enjoy certain plot twists, the variety of new and exciting mutants and some of the excellent action scenes, but will feel let down by the anti-climatic ending; overall for a non-fan it's a good watch. For a true fan of the X men, you will be bitterly disappointed at the fact that the film makes no attempt to stay true to its origin. (The opposite being one of the reasons why Spiderman is such a success). This, supposed last, of the X men films substitutes the amazing storyline of morals, ethics and action which Stan Lee weaved together, for a incoherent, unfulfilling sequence of events which would raise bile to the throat of anyone who actually read more than two of the comics or watched any of the cartoons. Also Jugernaught is as bad as he looks!

Hollywood dips into comic book realm to pull out a winner.,"Once again Hollywood dips into the comic book realm to pull out another movie. It paid off for them again in the Xmen franchise. This movie was a lot darker than the other two, with a lot more killing than had been in the first two. There was a lot of raw emotion floating around too, with everyone still reeling from Jean's death in the last movie. There are a few new mutants, some with some pretty awesome powers, and of course there are the humans who don't want people to have mutations, ie, the person who develops ""the cure"". In all, it was an awesome movie, with great action, some really great one liners coming from Hugh Jackman as always. Halle Berry doesn't seem very believable in this one, but then again, she was still reeling from the bad reviews from Catwoman, so you cant really blame her. I say its a movie worth seeing again, but seeing how I ticked off my babysitter last night by having to see the late show since EVERY other show was sold out, I will have to wait for it to come out on DVD. It was a good movie, worth your 8 bucks for admission.

I liked the first two more than this one because it had more heart and more character development; more angst if you will. I was intrigued by the ""death"" of Jean Grey in the second film. This one is a special effects deluge. When the Golden Gate bridge is moved like a board across a mud puddle, it staggers the imagination. If I were to look at this with too critical an eye, I might say, ""Couldn't the bad guys have done this crossing of San Francisco bay a little easier (maybe a couple of helicopters or a big boat). This part is almost for laughs. I was entertained and involved through most of the movie but at times it became almost a parody of itself. I understand they changed directors and this may account for it. Maybe a summer film can't cut the short attention spans unless we throw so much at the canvas that we can't distinguish the pictures.

This film had a lot of character development with just about every character and the story was told with such fast pace that you were never bored at all.

As a film major, I understand how difficult it is for a director to take over a project to make it his own after one or two other people have already tried to make it their own, but Ratner did a great job.

The Last Stand,"When director Bryan Singer left the X-Men franchise to make Superman Returns (2006), he was replaced by Brett Ratner (Red Dragon, Rush Hour), much to fans' dismay. However, the result is easily as enjoyable as the first two in the series, and despite several flaws which were not as destructive as one might think they could be, Ratner has kept the spirit of the franchise to deliver an action filled and twisting conclusion to the trilogy.This time around, humans have developed a mutant cure, and although not compulsory, many mutants want it. Magneto, however, believes this is the first step of the human-mutant war he is always preparing for, and so creates the Brotherhood in order to find the source of the cure (which is on Alcatraz Island) and destroy it. Meanwhile, Jean Grey has returned, this time as the worryingly powerful Phoenix who, torn between her two personalities, is talked into joining Magneto's army, which the X-Men must now help the humans defeat.It sounds very action packed, and it is. It is these scenes that are the most competent and confident, and are the highlight of the series. Finally, we are shown the full potential of all the X-Men's powers in the mutant standoff on Alcatraz, and the X-Men are shown to be the real heroes they are. It is the best climax to a superhero film so far, and is inventive with its display of mutant powers and the humans adapting to Magneto  their weapons are plastic, for example.On to the flaws and, whilst it may sound like I'm damning the film, it turns out that although some of these flaws are large, they didn't affect the overall enjoyment of the film as I thought they might. Firstly, the film is too short and contains too much. Both the Phoenix storyline and the cure storyline could have had a film each, but they are adequately combined, although it is the Phoenix storyline that suffers most from this  we never see enough of the Phoenix and her turmoil, and she is not as involved at the end as one would like. However, the scene at Jean's old house make up for this, and it has to be the most shocking and well-handled scene in the film.Secondly, there are too many characters. Bryan Singer managed to juggle all the characters the most effectively, but The Last Stand doesn't; and this isn't helped by its shorter running time (1hr 45 compared to X2's 2hrs 15). Whilst we focus in on many new characters, the established characters miss out (Cyclops, Rogue, Mystique, even Jean Grey). Worse, the new characters aren't all that effective  Ben Foster's Angel is utterly irrelevant, and Vinnie Jones is an obscene casting choice for Juggernaut. Kelsey Grammar's Beast, though, is absolutely brilliant, perfectly fitting the role that calls for calm judgement and more than a dash of feral ferocity. It is a shame that Rogue is sidelined, as she is the only mutant we already know that feels the cure is a good thing, and more could have been made of her feelings towards it.As said, The Last Stand is actually a very good film, and there is enough going on that the flaws pass by without affecting the overall result. The themes of terrorism, genetic engineering and stem cell research that the film makes links to makes it relevant to today's political world. The acting throughout is fine, the highlights still being Wolverine and Magneto (and so good are they that they are both getting their own spin-off films).A point that struck well in this film was the deeper exploration of Xavier's and Magneto's relationship than the other two films allowed. It is interesting that they both essentially want the same thing, but want it in radically different ways. The moment where Magneto scorns Pyro for disrespecting Xavier was an especially nice touch.Overall, one feels that The Last Stand was not quite as developed as it could have been, and it certainly needed to be longer to better juggle all the characters and sub-plots. But it is still an accomplished film with some stunning action scenes and is a fitting conclusion to the X-Men trilogy, if never quite reaching the peaks of X-Men 2.Rated: 8/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I miss Bryan Singer,"This film is a perfect case for why Hollywood isn't doing well at the box office. The film takes a franchise of two good films and regurgitates generic Hollywood crap.The dialogue in this film is full of cliché statements, and corny attempts at statements with deep meaning.. The dialogue sounds like the script of a novice, offering nothing to the characters.Another failure of the film is character development. While the comics provide histories for the characters, none is given for the newly introduced characters. The viewer is left to simply accept the character at face value, without any explanation for their character, their history, or their power. Even the developed characters lack any depth of the previous films.Overall the story seems rushed. The director seems to push the film forward through the action and thus the film suffers.If you like the first two films then I would suggest not seeing this one.

Better action, humor, sadness, effects and a stronger connection for our heroes and villains. X3 never undermines the audience and does all that is expected of it.

Short on Brains but High on Action,"X-Men: The Last Stand (2006)*** (out of 4)Brett Ratner steps into the director's chair for this third installment in the series. This time out both sides of the mutants must fight when a scientist learns of a cure that can turn the mutants back into humans. That's pretty much all of the story you need to know because, in truth, there's really not much going on here story wise. That's not necessarily a bad thing but I'm sure some fans will be upset that the new characters really aren't developed all that well and the older characters also seem to have been underwritten to the point where we get nothing new from them. With that said, none of those things hurt the movie too much because where it really works is during the special effects and action scenes. The highlight of the film takes place towards the end and involves the Golden Gate Bridge. I'm not going to ruin what happens for those who haven't seen the film but it's quite spectacular and shows a great deal of imagination. On top of it being creative, the entire sequence is just downright cool. The action scenes here are all extremely well-handled and I think Ratner does a very good job at keeping them moving at a fast pace. Of course, by now it should come as no surprise that the cast members own their roles. Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are all very good. Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, Rebecca Romijn and Ellen Page add some fun but it's Kelsey Grammar who really shines as Henry McCoy.

Half the movie of the previous X-Men.,"It doesn't take long to see that The Last Stand has a very different director than X2, and it also doesn't take long to figure out what Brett Ratner's philosophy for the third X-Men movie is. MORE! BIGGER! More mutants! More action scenes! Bigger explosions! More special effects! X-Men 3 tops X2 in all those areas I just mentioned, but it's definitely not the better movie.The main area I think The Last Stand suffers in, is the story. They took two absolutely huge stories that easily required their own movies (the Dark Phoenix and the mutant ""cure""), sand tried to stuff them all together into one plot. It just doesn't work well. Events seem too hurried and under-developed, and after the solid story of the last movie, that just isn't acceptable.I understand that story choices have to be made, and they won't always be made in the way I would do things, but the large body count and drastic character changes just seemed unwise, to me. X-men 3 is a decent movie, and nowhere near the horrible disaster that was still to come in X-Men Origins: Wolverine, but this pales in comparison to its predecessor.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Characters, Effects, and Story were all beyond outstanding.","The third X-Men film is more sophisticated and has a better story than the first one, and better action then the second. Here, the characters previously introduced but under used are utilized in a comprehensive and cohesive manner, and the newly introduced characters are blended in seamlessly with the story. The music is very good as is the acting. The cast-selection is still perfect.Last Stand continues the work of X2 as genre-defining. It is a work of art/comic book pulp fiction never before seen on the silver screen. The . Everything in this movie is exceedingly better in the sequel then the first two films. Like X2, the acting is superb. The dialogue is rich. Every character feels believable. No cartoonish villains, every side of the issue is presented by people who believe they are the ones who are in the right and the underlying message of tolerance and bigotry only add to the depth of this film. What's better then its predecessor is X3's action, FX and pace. It restores the sense of epic adventure and grand-scale storytelling that's been absent from far too many of today's alleged blockbusters.I can't imagine a better movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Kind of a weak end to a good trilogy.,"What a difference a director makes. While the previous two films in this franchise used Bryan Singer, the choice to go with Brett Ratner in this final film of the trilogy was a mistake. There was a tone and style to the previous X-Men movies that was just never quite captured in this one. The comedy seemed unnatural, the plot wasn't taken quite seriously enough, and the new characters were never given enough time to really fully develop. Perhaps some of the weakness of this film can be blamed on the previous two films being strong, independent storylines, thus not giving much to tie into a conclusive chapter of a trilogy.Despite X2 (2003) not holding to the traditional form of ""the trilogy conundrum"", the fact that X-Men III has to start with some very main characters missing is a plot point that requires viewers to have seen the previous film. The concept of a ""mutant cure"" definitely gives the film a good sense of finality (regardless of its pre- and post-credits scenes), except that much of the focus of the film is on Jean Grey's (Famke Janssen) unrivaled power bringing untold destruction to everywhere she visits. The distracted nature of the subplots and way too many new mutant introductions really waters down the whole film.I also understand that the end of a trilogy should bring some finality, but I really didn't like how they essentially kill everyone off in one way or another. Of course, this is just below my dislike of the cop-outs to bring characters back after they had been killed or disabled. Now that Bryan Singer has directed two more X-Men films in this six-film saga, none of this even matters anyway; essentially giving Singer a way to show us all how he would have ended the trilogy were he given the chance.Kind of a weak end to a good trilogy, I give X-Men: The Last Stand 3.0 stars out of 5.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another 10 of 10 X-Men movie,"I'm at a loss of words. This is indescribable.X-Men - The Last Stand is high drama, a wonderful and immense story.First of all: to all those that enjoyed the first two movies: this one is just as good, at least, at least that.One second in this one is more intense than hundreds of the many crap films released today put together. It's palatable, visible in the very air, just like Phoenix's godly Power.It is a different film compared to the first two, with a different emphasis. Brett Ratner and a practically entire new behind the camera team have, inevitably a different focus, approach than Bryan Singer and his team. It's more brutal, less comics-like, consequently even further removed from the comics' story than before.But it's all still there, the familiar faces, characters, from the opening sequence and onward, coming to life, a fact still amazing to me, five years after the first movie.The younger Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Eric Lensherr (Ian McKellen) working together finding the young Jean Grey, the Phoenix-to-be, realizing immediately that they are in way over their heads.Jean is a Class Five mutant, as far «above» (power wise) the other mutants as they are «above» the other humans, and now, when her power is emerging fully, there is no place for her in the world.A «cure» is found for mutants, one changing their genetic make-up, one removing a crucial part of themselves, and rage is rising from the deepest of dark corners.The stakes are clearly higher in this one, right from the start. We are shown that early, with the first fatality, with the first death, and it only gets worse (or better) from then on. Many have stated that this should have been an R-rated film, and I, since I want films to be made solely for an «adult» audience, certainly agree with that.It centers on Phoenix. Almost all plots and characters touch her in some way, and this is a very good thing. The X-Men comics would have been lesser without her, in so many ways, and so would the films. Famke Jansen does a great, beyond great job playing her in quite the minimalist way. Less is more.Storm gets more screen time this time, but she's not really taking center stage in any way. The three main characters are Phoenix, Magneto and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and that is also how it should be.If I wanted to do some nitpicking, there are a few things I could point out that I would have changed, but I won't. The only fact I will mention is that the movie is at least half an hour too short, but that is true for every great film. We love what we see and we want more.Yet another 10 of 10 X-Men movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun flick but not the X-Men,"I found 'X-Men: The Last Stand' to be enjoyable enough for an action flick yet it was lacks the essence of the comic books and leaves you wishing they had just waited for Bryan Singer to finish with 'Superman Returns' so he could work on this.This film sees tensions between humans and mutants reach an all-time high as the government turn a mutant 'cure' into a weapon, something Magneto is all to quick to exploit for his Mutant Freedom cause. Meanwhile, Jean Grey has returned from the dead to unleash the darker side of her powers and her old team-mates are forced to realise she is now the enemy.The usual main protagonist characters of Xavier, Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Jean, Rogue and Bobby are back and in usual form (with the exception of Jean, who has undergone a few changes!). Without giving too much away, how this film differs from the previous two is that we don't get almost full focus on Wolverine, Rogue and Xavier this time and instead Storm and Bobby are given the chance to play a larger role while new and lesser known characters are brought into the limelight. Kitty Pryde is finally given a bit of a personality rather than just being 'the girl who can walk through walls' and we get to meet Beast, who is wonderfully brought to life by Kelsey Grammar. On the sidelines, there is also more of Colossus and an introduction to Warren 'Angel' Worthington.On the side of the antagonists, there is a deeper insight into Magneto's character and the audience are truly left wondering whether he is unhinged or just a determined man whose goals may be harsh but are right way for mutants. It's a dilemma that makes clear why Magneto is never short of supporters and Sir Ian McKellen's excellently vehement performance in the role serves to highlight there is much more to the character than his just being a stereotypical 'bad guy'. It's also interesting to see how he and Xavier were once good friends and even as their friendship has cooled when their differing goals for the future of mutants has divided them, there is still an underlying sense of respect between them. Pyro is back and though he tries to come across in a darker light, instead he just seems like a moody, self-absorbed brat who is in a huff because Bobby was teacher's pet. On the other hand, Vinnie Jones is effective as Juggernaut, getting to indulge in his real-life thuggery in the role.The special effects are as spectacular as expected, with impressive action scenes (especially in the final battle) as we see the mutants' powers brought to life. So, what's the problem then? Well, quite simply, it wasn't all that was promised in the second film. X2 was superior because it did portray the idea that the X-Men are a team who all work together whereas here leaves you wondering 'where is everyone?' Also, Phoenix was not the awesome creature hinted at in X2 or depicted as in the comic books and instead she just seemed like Jean suffering from a bit of PMT. As such, there wasn't any sense of shock when she unleashed her powers but rather a sense that you wished she'd just give herself a shake and grow up. Purists of the comic books will definitely find it hard to digest the fact this film veers further away from comic book canon in the same vein as the previous two films did, especially the timeline of events like Angel's introduction and the fate of three major characters.'X-Men: The Last Stand' will keep most people amused for a couple of hours, if they ignore comic book mythology, but I personally was left feeling as if it wasn't the X-Men that I loved in the comic books and Nineties cartoon show. And the ending is such that it is both a satisfying way to round off a trilogy and also leaves room for a possible fourth film, I hope they just reboot and start afresh if they ever do go back to the franchise. Maybe then, we can get a Cyclops and Storm who aren't a B-characters, the real Phoenix, an adult Rogue, a Gambit and many other important elements missing from the film series.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A disappointing but still enjoyable end to the trilogy,"X-Men: The Last Stand is a disappointing end to the trilogy but it's still enjoyable. It has too many plots in too little time and the phoenix storyline feels extremely rushed and the some characters are wasted. However, the action sequences are well filmed and enjoyable to watch.

X-Men the Last Stand,The third X-Men film is a let down. It's not terrible but it's a drop in quality from the first two films. The cast is once again good and I do enjoy the final battle. The problem is that there are too many plots and non feel like they are fleshed out enough. Even the stuff that was done pretty well was not on the same level as the previous films.

"A nice and spectacular action flick. Nothing more, nothing less.","I expected the worst. No Bryan Singer, the previews didn't looked very good and the critics were not exactly raving about the movie. But really, the movie was not as bad as I expected it to be. On the contrary. The movie is a good looking and spectacular science-fiction/action that is perhaps lacking in the same depth and layers the previous two X-Men movies had but it's good and entertaining enough on its own.In essence ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is a good looking and spectacular action flick. This is perhaps not what the fans hoped and expected it to be but the neutral, unbiased viewer will be surely entertained by the movie.There are plenty of action sequences in the movie to thrill and please the viewer but even superior are the special effects. No expenses were spared, with as a result some spectacular looking action- but also non-action sequences. It makes the movie good looking and entertaining at the same time.It's a bit of a shame that with the many new characters and different new plot lines the movie yet fails to create some depth and make the story more multiple layered and meaningful, as the previous two X-Men movies were. This is probably due to the short running time of the movie; 104 minutes. It doesn't leave the movie any room to flesh out the characters and create some more plot lines with depth and emotions. The movie is a bit shallow and simple at times. The movie has plenty of emotions in it (the death of characters, love-stories) but yet the movie fails to ever get emotional, due to this previous mentioned reason. It doesn't make the movie halve as powerful as it perhaps could had been.The movie brings back lots of old character from the previous two movies but also introduces some new ones. This time Storm plays a bigger role in the movie just as Jean Grey, who sort of is the central character of the movie and plays a key-part. It gives the both actresses Halle Berry and Famke Janssen more chance to show their great acting skills. It has as a result that some of the characters are pushed to the back (Rogue, Cyclops, among others) though. The movie also introduces some new characters such as Beast, Juggernaut and Angel. Beast is perfectly played by Kelsey Grammar, who fits the role like a glove. And don't ask me why but I have the feeling that Ellen Page (Kitty Pryde) is going to be a big star someday. Angel seems like a sort of redundant character, since he hardly plays a role in the movie, though he is yet often prominently present. But I guess it's OK, since he'll obviously play a more significant role in future X-Men movies and this movie was merely used to introduce his character, very much like was the case with Iceman, Pyro and Colossus in the previous movie, who all also play a role again in this movie. The villains might perhaps this time not come across as intriguing and prominent as in the previous two movies but that is due to the fact that the true enemy this time in the movie is not a person but it's 'the cure'. Nevertheless Ian McKellen still impresses as Magneto, who by now surely has grown out to be one of the best and most memorable villains of this decade.Not only the special effects look good but so does the cinematography by Dante Spinotti and so does the action editing, that always keeps the pace high and the movie interesting. The musical score from John Powell also impresses and works very well in the movie.It all in all is one of the better and more entertaining action movies of the year, with a fantastic ending that leaves the door open for (hopefully) more sequels.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best movie of 2006 regardless of genera,"I've seen this movie three times...love the storyline, the non-stop forward-moving pace; very well directed and the acting (small, medium, and large roles) is PERFECT. Wonderful emotionlove the metaphors about fear and ignorance, hate and intolerance of human beings against each other. Speaking of ignorance, no one that actually saw this movie could vote it under two stars.Overall, the very best movie of 2006 regardless of genera. This is so gritty, real, and heartfelt that it makes movies like V for Vendetta, Sin City and Constantine look foolish by comparison. X3 even outshines movies like Batman Begins and the original X-Men movie. Do yourself a favor and see this instant classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Could be better,"X-Men: The Last Stand (2006), a mutant rollercoaster that, despite some flaws, delivers a satisfying punch. The ensemble cast dives into their roles with fervor, with Hugh Jackman's Wolverine and Ian McKellen's Magneto stealing the show. The film editing skillfully juggles the myriad of mutant storylines, creating a narrative that is both ambitious and action-packed. The strength of The Last Stand lies in its exploration of mutant identity and the consequences of choice, adding depth to the superhero spectacle. While the music doesn't quite soar to the heights of its predecessors, it complements the emotional beats. The weakness, however, lies in the occasional overcrowding of characters, diluting the impact of some pivotal moments. Cinematography captures the mutant powers with visual flair, making for some memorable set pieces. At 7/10, X-Men: The Last Stand is a flawed but enjoyable ride, serving as both a culmination and a stepping stone in the X-Men saga.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Magnificent,"Well first of all i am just sick of people hating off this movie it was amazing to me and don't try to say that i just think that because i don't know a lot about X-men but believe me i know plenty. I can see how the time of the movie is a problem and how some of the new characters didn't get the time they deserved but all in all it was pretty great. Now i am not going to go on and on i just wanted to say i would have liked it more if Rogue would have gotten a bigger part in the movie and got to show off her powers more. Rogue has always been my favorite, her and Iceman are good together but where is Gambit when you need him. Iceman was kind of flirting with Kitty Pryde in the movie but have to give props to Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Shawn Ashmore, Anna Paquin, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Kelsey Grammar, Famke Janssen, Aaron Stanford, James Marsden, Ellen page, and Ben Foster (lovin the wings)and the rest of the cast you guys were great.So deserves a 10 out of 10.Now I just have to say one more thing and thats there has to be another X-men movie",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It's now or never,"I love these types of films, where everything in the previous films have built up to this moment. ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is one of those films. This film doesn't go further in the investigation of Logans (Wolverine) past because instead it focuses on the bigger picture: the conflict between mankind and mutants. There has been a cure discovered and which causes the Brotherhood to react by wanting to destroy the cure and the source of the cure, but will the X-Men allow this to happen? Also the character focus shifts on Jean Grey who lets out her more ""wild"" side which is so cool. Many plot twists are seen in this film which are so cool. While the Bortherhood react quite badly to the cure the X-Men, whilst not happy with there being a cure since mutation is not a disease, try and stop the destruction the baddies intend to cause. There is a fresh feel to this film and I think it's been due to the fact there was a new director directing this film, Brett Ratner. I think it may be the best out of the franchise so far, not sure, but it's great anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Going back to the drawing board,"The loss of director Bryan Singer affected X3 immensely. The great build-up and characterisations of X2 did not bear any fruits, as X3 lacks quality, consistency and coherent narration.Throughout the movie Brett Ratner's direction is sporadic, with high-octaned battle sequences and low in-betweens. It is clear from the start that he is uncomfortable or rather inexperienced in directing a fantasy/comics-based movie, as he couldn't decide if X3 should be a Prison Break drama, a Rush Hour comedy or an X-Men movie.The introductions of Angel and Jean Grey/Phoenix feel abrupt, while too much time is given to Iceman, Rogue and Kitty Pride love triangle. The wonderful Nightcrawler has completely disappeared from the movie, whilst the highly potential characters of Beast and Colossus are not given enough development time that merits their characters' importance on the comics.Furthermore, killing Cyclops and Professor X makes the latter half of the movie unbalanced and insubstantial. Professor X IS the core of the X-Men and the main reason the story even exists. By removing both vital characters, and undermining Storm's powerful persona, the leadership of the X-Men is then left to Wolverine. Wolvering is not and will never be a leader material. His personality is such that he is a cool darkhorse, an outsider or a vagabond. He is neither a teacher nor a leader, and it is the wrong direction to take the movie.The screenwriter also made the wrong choice of additional villains, although Juggernaut was fun to watch. Finally, the last stand at the Alcatraz Lab island feels more of a skirmish than a full blown war. Bring out the Sentinels in X4 and get rid of Brett Ratner, if there will ever be another sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men: The Last Stand,"After a brief respite in ""X2"" (2003) we have reverted to the rather procedural and unexciting format for this third instalment of malevolent mutant-mayhem. This time ""Magneto"" (Sir Ian McKellen) is outraged when the human government develops a top secret cure for mutants. On the face of it, this is going to lead to another simple battle royal between the forces of our man-metal and his eternal nemesis ""Xavier"" (Patrick Stewart) and his army of fair-minded supporters led by ""Wolverine"" (Hugh Jackman). Thing is, though, ""Magneto"" has an ace up his sleeve in the form of the ""Dark Phoenix"" that has turned ""Jean Gray"" (Famke Janssen) into something more lethal than anyone can imagine. Can she be stopped, persuaded, destroyed? It's really a bit of same old, same old, this - great visual effects, loads of pyrotechnics and a good old dose of good versus evil, but the story is actually pretty weak and the dialogue seems to regurgitate much of that from the first film. Jackman really tries to inject a sense of thrill into this, and there's no denying that Ben Foster looks particularly hot with his angelic wings, but otherwise it might as well be another episode in a Marvel mini-series that you just know will deliver nothing more at the end than an opportunity for a sequel. It is a good looking film, but the two leads are overly hammy, and Kelsey Grammer isn't the only one to feel a bit blue at the seriously over-orchestrated denouement.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great, Inspiring, Imagitive Movie!, X-Men: The Last Stand","I would give this movie 10 X's up! It was an action-packed thriller, that threw me off on a lot of scenes I couldn't even imagine. It was great seeing some new characters I have never seen before be in the movie. The actors and actress played their roles very well. Although, it was fun to see the movie have it's third continuation I thought there was too much harsh drama and the director should of explained more problems within the characters. For example, what ever happened to Nightclawer, wasn't he suppose to be in the movie? If so, he sure didn't make his appearance which was too bad do to the fact that he is such a great actor and the director could have explained his history.

X3! A grand finale or is it?,"In the last couple of years the fan boys have taken over the movie gossip news and if anything doesn't meet with their satisfaction they completely write it off and do all in their powers to bring the film down. Well I'm hear to say to all those fan boys...GET A CLUE and perhaps a life.I thought X3 was going to be terrible from all the news I heard. The film was rushed, the effects were bad, and the new director was a joke. WRONG!!! This film continues right where the second film left off and just as the second film raised the bar set by the first film so does this one and then it successfully brings the film to a satisfying conclusion. In fact the Sunday afternoon crowd I was surrounded by applauded loudly at the end of the film. It was a crowd pleaser for all and not just the fan boys.The reason why I liked the XMen movies is because in order to bring the films to the silver screen the directors and screenwriters of these films weren't afraid to do actual adaptation or refinement to make the world they're portraying more dramatic. They're not afraid to take the source material and separate what translates well into a film and what does not and throw the latter away. As much as I liked the Spider-Man movies they always seem to me like I was watching a video comic-book. Sometimes staying too close to the source material keeps the characters in the film from jumping off the screen.Everything from the acting, sets, direction, effects were all very well done. Also the soundtrack to this film is a Grade A, classic movie score.If you haven't seen this film and you like the X-Men movies or just a good summer film then go see it. You'll be glad you did. Of course you should also stay till the credits end. Its not the biggest payoff in the world but it does make you wonder if this truly was the X-Men's last stand.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The series 'X'-cels again.,"My Take: It's just as imperfect as the first two was, but when it's fun, it doesn't disappoint.One of the first big must-see summer blockbusters of 2006, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND is everything what you'd come to expect from a loud an reasonably entertaining finale of a long-running, big-budget franchise. This may not be the best in the series, it's certainly the most action-packed, even if it isn't exactly as kind to its writing department like the second film. THE LAST STAND, nonetheless, is an improvement over the original (and I kinda like that film), not just in terms of special effects, but also its pacing and writing, but basically more on pacing as the second was more on the writing. For fans, THE LAST STAND sorts out every single cliffhanger, plot strand and question thrown at you in the previous films, some of which you rarely thought of. To everyone else, like myself, who simply walks into a film like the X-MEN franchise expecting a pure summer popcorn bonanza, will have a grand time in pure ""check-your-brains-at-the-door"" entertainment.The plot in this finale concerns the discovery of a ""cure"" for mutants who kill off their mutant cells, therefore making them as human as the next guy. The X-Men, led by Professor X (Patrick Stewart), feel that mutation is not a disease in which it can be cured by a simple antidote, but their approach of the situation is more on curiosity and concern. While the ever-rebellious Magneto (Ian McKellen) feels that the Human race has gone too far, and decides to build his own mutant army, recruiting every mutant in America, to rebel against the ""cure"" project. While this war ensues, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is reunited with Jean Grey, know a mind-controlling juggernaut who destroys everything in her path.Every single thing you could possibly think of to finish the series are resolved here, and even if it is beyond your concern, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND will still delight its audience with pure action-packed popcorn-chomping excitement. The film makes you care less of plot and screenplay and lets you drown more on action the best that visual effects have to offer. With that and all, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND makes a great start for yet another busy year of popular action blockbusters.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"very visual. entertaining, too. and really bad.","Xmen 3 is entertaining. It's a film about comic book characters. So it's not hard to be entertained.The story as a comic book idea is basically a good one. A potential cure for the mutant 'disease' has been found in a young mutant's blood. Anti-mutant supporters are rallying mutants to join the ranks of normal society by volunteering to receive treatment. But Magneto and his brotherhood see this as a weapon to eliminate the mutant identity completely. Xavier and his students stand as the mediators between the hard line mutants and the humans. Sounds good. And it is.What this film fails at is bringing in a truth to the characters, a sense believability in characters and what they are doing. One could say, this is a film based on a comic where people can shoot lasers out of their eyes, have adamantium claws in their hands, and walk through walls, so therefore disbelief should be somewhat suspended. Sure. And if X-Men was left to exist in the comic book medium or even as a cartoon I would maybe be less critical. But the suits and ties have decided to ride this comic movie wave and capitalize on the X-Men franchise, consequently choosing to elevate these characters and stories to a human level with live actors. And the third film in this trilogy failed to understand this, resulting in fake characters, cheap dialogue, overly sentimental situations.The film struggles with the amount of characters introduced. This is a challenge considering the amount of mutants existing in the X-Men universe and so on some level I will accept the difficultly in doing this successfully in a film shy of two hours. Yet, as von Brusak, from metroactive.com wrote in his X-Men 3 review, someone (the director) with a more careful hand could have done this more successfully. With this in mind the film tends to feel sloppy and rushed.For instance, Angel is having trouble accepting his mutant-ness. His rich father suggests the cure. Angel is hesitant, and just before he takes the cure injection he burst out of the straps and is suddenly proud to be a mutant. He flys around a little in the film. At the end he saves his rich father from amidst the chaos of the war between magneto and the humans.And more. Hank McCoy, The Beast, is also introduced in the film. He is a diplomat, working in the government for the betterment of the mutant cause. He talks about diplomacy. He is rational and smart. He reads, and does it upside down. He is against unnecessary violence. But by the end of the film he flips a switch, and fights a bloody fight side by side with Wolverine and the other X-Men, killing and smashing all those bad mutants.Other characters work simply as cutouts in the film. Juggernaut smashes through walls because Magneto says so. Colossus carries a large TV with one hand down the halls of the X-Men mansion. That's about the extent of their character development.The love story in the film exists between Jean Grey, who has returned as the all powerful Dark Phoenix who now works with Magneto, and Wolverine. Wolverine knows Jean Grey is trapped in the evil mask and that it's a matter of getting through to her. At the end of the film, when Phoenix is disintegrating mutants and humans and buildings with her power, Wolverine approaches her despite the possibility of being disintegrated, and tries to level with her, convince her to stop the destruction. She says, you would die for them? He says, no, I would die for you. And Wolverine kills her with his adamantium claws. The saying, love conquers all, comes to mind. Wolverine's love over humanity conquers the love for a woman. No comment.One thing this film does successfully is entertain. There is constant action and even suspense. As an early summer blockbuster this film hits its marks more or less. Maybe it did so even better than I can grasp. Near the end of the film, when the good have won, and the bad are defeated (this shouldn't count as a spoiler) I looked over at my buddy sitting next to me, and to my surprise, he was fighting back tears. I though maybe it's because of allergy season, or he was chocking on popcorn. I was concerned. Later he told me it was an epic ending, so powerful. I guess this is what entertainment is about.So for what it is, I'll give it a 7 out of 10. Why not.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Best Sequel to Any Superhero Movie,"DEAR GOD PEOPLE... X-Men 3, is simply one of, if not THE greatest superhero movie I have ever seen. Everything about the movie - the action, the drama, the complete anger and seemingly rage of the film, and its meanings, are just too great to be ignored. Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and Famke Janssen... god. They were absolutely magnificent in every aspect.This movie made me stare in awe, almost CRY, YEAH! CRY, and literally FEEL what the characters felt. Brett Ratner did an excellent job, especially the dramatic scenes. Very effective.The only thing I found 'bad'... bad isn't right... 'un-right' about it, was some people didn't get enough to do (Mystique, Cyclops, Rogue, Angel), and that it was a little rushed at the ending, yet still, it made my heart want to plop out of my chest at the end.Famke has seriously made her characters mark into an image that will be burned in my head for a long time. And Storm.. oh, Storm... Halle actually has a character to play in this one. She was one of the best parts of it, and she played her excellently.If you hated this movie... you need to watch it again. And I hope you all stayed AFTER the credits - it is CERTAIN, they HAVE to have an X4.And I am definitely seeing the Wolverine, Magneto, and (hopefully) Storm spin-offs when they come, if ever they were better than this.9.5/10... so I'll put a 9.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Rewatching X-Men: The Last Stand, I find it to be quite a mixed bag. With Brett Ratner taking the reins, the film feels like a step back in quality from the second film. The general story is good, but the execution often leaves quite a bit to be desired.The film is heavy-handed with its themes, addressing them only in a cursory manner. This superficial treatment of complex issues is frustrating, as it detracts from the film's potential impact. However, there are still some highlights that make the rewatch worthwhile.Xavier, Magneto, and Wolverine continue to be the standouts for me. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart do some great work, bringing depth and nuance to their characters. The new additions to the cast are a mixed bag. I appreciate the introduction of Beast, who works well within the story. Unfortunately, others like Angel, Kitty Pryde, Juggernaut, and Magneto's edgy mutant crew come across as cheesy and underdeveloped.On the plus side, the final battle is excellent. It's well-choreographed and provides the kind of spectacle I enjoy in a superhero film. I also rate the scene in Jean's childhood home as the greatest scene of the trilogy. Though it heavily relies on visual effects, the combination of performances and the score give it significant weight in a film that's otherwise light on genuine drama.Speaking of the score, composer John Powell's work is excellent here. The evolution of the theme through the films is fully realised, and it sounds fantastic. The music during the final Dark Phoenix confrontation is particularly impressive, adding an emotional layer to the climax.Overall, X-Men: The Last Stand is a disappointing end to the trilogy. It has its moments of brilliance but is ultimately dragged down by uneven storytelling and some lacklustre character development. It's a film that had potential but doesn't quite live up to the standards set by its predecessors.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 8.0

Not so bad when you get your head past the shocks.,"Bryan Singer should have never declined The Last Stand. The reigns went to Brett Ratner, who's taken us on a severe roller-coaster of emotions. Now having watched this more than once, I can safely say I feel warmer towards it, knowing full well what takes place, and to be honest, it's not all that bad. TLS doesn't stand up to X2, but it has big guts with a battle to end all battles. The government are giving mutants a 'choice', by providing an antidote to cure them of their powers. Whilst some mutants accept this bargain, others refuse and unite against this 'threat'. Stuck in the middle are the X-Men, who have Jean Grey to contend with. Her powers are too strong for her to handle. Her alter-ego Phoenix threatens to destroy everything. The Last Stand is both riveting and insanely annoying, because it dare do what other superhero films (or most of films for that matter) do not. The aggravation comes from certain events being brushed swiftly under the carpet. The end show-down more than makes up for the haphazard middle section, so it does not end on such a sour note.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bummer,"I just rewatched it. If you could merge the best of the previous two with the best of from this one you would have a powerful film.
You can't blame Rather because he didn't make this project in a bubble. Multiple producers and reps from Marvel had a sat and input on it. Just like any other comic book project. The studio knew what the movie was months before it's release. So they are as much to blame if not more since they have all the power. It's just like the Fantastic Four reboot. They could have pushed the release date if they wanted to, but they thought they a quality project. I'm glad Dark Phoenix got pushed back. Hopefully, it's creator's saw room for improvement and did so. It may be last for a few major actors in the franchise, I hope they go out on a positive note.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

There's a ton of credits,so you'll have to wait in the theatre for about 5 minutes till the credits end but its worth the wait.Please get as many people as you can to see this with you, and give it good ratings!

'In chess the pawns go first',"Despite its myriad detractors, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is a robust superhero film that, while clearly suffering in comparison to its majestic predecessor, packs an entertaining wallop. Large-scale and bearing an exhilarating finale, this third chapter in the newly refreshed X-Men franchise rates as a polished and well-assembled comic book film.Therein, however, may lie the biggest issue with ""X-Men: The Last Stand."" While the Bryan Singer's ""X2"" was a sophisticated, operatic action film, Brett Ratner's ""...Last Stand"" is like an operetta culled straight from comic book pages. Broad and quippy, the film does not trust itself to regain the passionate, cinematic bombast of its immediate predecessor. It would rather be a more direct analog to its comic book source. Still, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is better than much of its paneled brethren.Attempting to intertwine two stories, the film weaves together parts of the famed ""Dark Phoenix"" saga with a b-story involving a cure for mutancy. Fans of the source material decried the plot for selling short the story of the world's most powerful mutant, and, while this criticism may be valid, the film does the best it can focusing on the dual stories. When it works, the plot compels, bearing broad themes of acceptance of one's own self and abilities.Even though it must maneuver through some admittedly misguided character beats, the cast is generally up to snuff. Hugh Jackman is given less to do here, but the addition of the charismatic Kelsey Grammar is welcome. The film's aesthetic combines steely blues and natural tones, making for a film that is mostly rich looking. There is a satisfying visual scope that makes the film feel big, enhancing its epic qualities. The film moves quickly, building to a satisfying and bone-jarring climax.What ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" comes down to is a tension between a script that lacks the shape and sharpness of a great superhero film and a cast and action beats befitting a great superhero film. In the end, the superficialities of the cast and epically entertaining stand- offs win out. Ratner's ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" may not have the heart and soul of its predecessors, but it has the flash and spectacle that makes forgiving it for what it lacks very easy.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men: The Last Stand:The Doc's Review,"X-men 3 is the most fast paced and most fun of the trilogy.The storyline is very political and involves a lot of metaphors including racism,homosexuality,dictatorship,democracy,and prejudice.The separate story lines for each character were great however Archangel is a very brief but important character.Beast,Leech,Juggernaut,Spyke,Multiple Man,Archangel,and many others are among the new mutants featured in the third installment.The Phoenix storyline was by far the best one and had a lot of great build up and at times reminded me of an exorcism.X-Men 3 is as far away from the crap o meter as Sin City because both are intensely faithful adaptations of my favorite comics.X-Men 3 is also packed with amazing special effects that blow your mind.I was waiting for the all out mutant war and it did not disappoint it was absolutely amazing.The costumes,lighting,sound are all as good as it gets as the X-Men franchise proves it doesn't need Brian Singer in order to be successful.X-Men 3 is a must see if you liked the first two you'll love this.It is X-Fan heaven.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A failed ending,"The last Stand is without a doubt the worst of the original x-men trilogy. It is dumb,boring and the characters in the movie are neither likable nor persons that you could relate to like the first two movies. This movie was the beginning of the ""New Dark Age"", as I call it, of comic book movies that lasted for about 3 to 4 years and the majority of that type of film was either critically, commercially or both banned and it took the rise of the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the the superheroes to come back even stronger than before. This would the worse movie in the x-men film series up until the X-men Origins Wolverine ,which is considered to be one the worse films of the superheroes' movies as a whole",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not to best of the series but a grand final installment that is very worthy,"SYNOPSIS: A ""cure"" for mutancy threatens to alter the course of history. For the first time,mutants have a choice: retain their uniqueness,though its isolates and alienates them,or give up their powers an become human. The opposing viewpoints of mutant leaders which in this case the leader of the X-Men,Professor Xavier(Patrick Stewart),who preaches tolerance,and Magneto(a notable but brilliant Ian McKellen)who believes in the survival of the fittest who also believes that this is an outrage against the races and leads to war between the two sides. They are put to the ultimate test that will trigger a war to end all wars leaving complete chaos and total destruction of both mutant and human alike. Meanwhile,Jean Grey(Famke Janssen)is revealed to be alive,but with different powers causing her alter-ego to come out. Now that she is possessed by the powers of the Dark Phoenix-it has become a threat of national security and the rest of the X-Men must race against the clock to stop a mutant war that will end in oblivion.If you have follow the first two installments of the ""X-Men"" series than you know the rest of the chapter and its characters in the third and possibly final installment of the series. ""X-Men:The Last Stand"" is not the best in the series,but it does have some grand moments that make it stand out. This is one of the most emotional elaborate and mostly complex out of all the series. And if this proves to be the last chapter of the series than it is a disappointment that will leave many of its die-hard fans heartbroken and shocked. However,""X-Men 3"" does not disappoint its legion of fans neither. By keeping the same action-packed sequences and brilliant non-stop special effects in tact here,and some of it is jawdropping to believe in what will happen next. Speaking of which this one has more action galore than any of the two previous entries in the whole series and once it catches your attention,you'll see why. Also included is a lot of great visuals here and new characters are added including more mutants who either fight on the side of good or evil. In other words,its a different type of super-hero movie that is totally different from its previous two films. This is courtesy of director Brett Ratner(Rush Hour films),who basically takes over the direction of the two previous installments from Bryan Singer(who was at the helm of the first two X-Men films which were made in 2000 and 2003).For one,there are a lot a mistakes here. Don't get me wrong,the movie is awesome as far as the action sequences and visual effects and extra special effects are involved,but here Ratner is trying to do too much into one movie since the movie runs at a length of 104 minutes long,the fastest movie ever made in the franchise and likely so to some of the X-Men fans who were looking for more here. First off,the story lines in the movie seemed to be separate and basically crammed together into one film,and also if you notice the acting is very redundant here since characters are one-sided. The effectiveness of Ratner's direction was rushed when you can take the same characters and subplots and extend the movie even further which he didn't do. And that's a shame when some characters are rarely used-which in one points are the cases of Mystique and other characters. Speaking of the characters much of it really centers on Jean Grey(Famke Janssen),Storm (Halle Berry),Wolverine(Hugh Jackman),Raven(Anna Paquin),and Cyclops (James Marsden) and new characters introduced are worth noticing: Beast(played with absolutely superb force by Kelsey Grammar),Angel(Ben Foster),and Jaggernaut(Vinnie Jones). Besides the ones that stand out are worth seeing is Wolverine(magnificently played by Hugh Jackman)and the evil mutant/tyrant Magneto(played with mangum force by Ian McKellen). If there is another installment,we will have to see what happens within the characters. This ones is packed action,packed drama,and packed full of surprises.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fast movie,The big problem with this movie it's the fact that you're left with a sensation of emptiness.When the movie end.You have already forgotten most of it.Or you don't feel like talking about it.When someone will ask you about X-Men 3.You will probably say . - Yeah that *part* was good.That was cool!THis is bad because the story was well put .But because of how the character are introduced and developed you really feel abandoned.A lot of important character lose their power during this movie or just plain die. It's would have been easier to accept if not everything was thrown inside one.Everything go fast.You just don't dispatch important character quick like thisAt the end of the movie you're already thinking . What? It's already the end?Sometime it's a sign of a great movie.The Movie is pretty fun regardless.But it's simply not one of these movie that you talk about 1-2 hours with friend after viewing it eating a good dinner.You will remember 1-2 partThey should just have mentioned to us directly that they don't want to continue the movie sequence.THis movie is better if you watch it right after the 2 other.It's might not leave a sensation of emptiness.But when you wait 2-3 years for this.You feel abandoned by the production,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
not only solidly crafted but also wise,"Since I haven't seen the previous two installments and am not a great buff of a X-men series, I have a lay view on the film and cannot say whether the pic works as a comic adaptation. However, I must admit that it certainly works as a movie. Existential dilemmas this film deals with are very interesting. The main theme is otherness and social reception of otherness. Can this otherness be called disease? Does society need mutants? What to do with them - 'cure' or not? These questions may provoke heated discussions after the screening. Furthermore, the film focuses more on breathtaking action sequences aided by professionally made special effects than on creating atmosphere, which seems to be a good idea as my attention was riveted throughout the flick. Brett Ratner's film is incredibly intense and fast-paced so you really shouldn't be bored. What also appeals to me is ingenuity which mainly covers the use of superpowers. The biggest shortcoming of the film is its episodic character. Director applies too many threads and most of them is underdeveloped and seems only just mentioned. Ratner should have resigned from some of them and developed thoroughly the crucial ones like Pheonix struggle for being herself. Some character's potential also regrettably remains unused. To sum up, I recommend X-Men: The Last Stand because it's a piece of solid, wise entertainment.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What to expect...,"I went to see X3 this Friday, highly expecting excellency. The movie started out with two scenes on two characters in their younger selves--Jean and a new guy who you might have seen in the commercial, the guy with wings. This was a great thing and boosts my rating. It was not only interesting but it told a lot about the main plots about the movie, which I will refrain from telling.This movie was directed by a different person--Brett Ratner. The first two movies in the series were directed by Bryan Singer, and the change of director is evident in this movie. The special effects were awesome and I can't expect any better of them. However, the plot was rambling on about nothing... more specifically, how powerful Jean is and all that. The action was immense yet the plot was thinning as the movie went on. It seemed as if it had been longer yet had to be cut short.The first 30 minutes or so of the movie the plot was thickening, yet not much was going on. Basically, all you find out is that Jean is really powerful, which is probably what you knew before the movie, though the action was OK. The next part was just... iffy, though trust me when I say you'll get some major shocks. And the last part was intense with action, and I was always on the edge of my seat. However, there was a corny ending to this movie that I will not tell you but convinces me that there probably is going to be an X4, which I doubt will be good because some of the actors will be too old.Basically, X3 wasn't as good as I expected, though overall it wasn't a bad movie. Don't expect too much of it except for some action and some major shocks. X3 is not the best movie in the world, but I've seen worse. For the plot, two stars. For the movie and acting and special effects... three stars. I don't know about you, but I'd give it a generous 2 1/2 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Getting' the cure so you can go back home to Mommy and Daddy?,"I really could not help thinking throughout this movie about gays and lesbians. This movie was so much about acceptance and about a ""cure,"" that is is a natural jump to acceptance of gays and lesbians and the so- called ""cure"" that some right-wing religious groups are promoting. I know it is not a political movie, but maybe that is what the writers had in mind. I don't know, but it certainly affected my viewing.Of course, the reason I even watched the movie was Halle Barry. I realize that many watch it for Hugh Jackman, and that is cool, because he was great in this as he has been in the previous two. Berry, of course, is to die for.Ian McKellen and Famke Janssen were also great. Really, the whole cast was good. I could not criticize any of them.I just cannot get the picture of Rebecca Romijn lying on the floor of the truck and being rejected by those who used to be her friends. Even the rejected reject.

What a blockbuster!,"I had the pleasure of watching this film yesterday, and all I can say is wow...I'm a big fan of comics and more often then not disappointed when comic characters are put on the big screen. This was not the case with this franchise and X3 continues where X2 left off.I guess if you want to be anal you can search for things to change but as a whole this movie delivers, considering it had big shoes to fill after X2.Enjoy it, it's well worth the time and money and definitely needs the big screen experience. Maybe after watching it a second time and can look for flaws or critics.There are twists, turns and surprises so see it ASAP so no one spoils anything...Would be a shame to learn too much about this movie before seeing it.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
You'll be Blown Away! (by special effects and big action that is),"This is the kind of movie you should't wait to see. There are a million surprises, that any comic book or movie fan should not allow to have spoiled for them. After the delicate care Bryan Singer used for both ""X-Men"", and ""X2: X-Men United"" I was somewhat fearful of a change in director. My fears were definitely warranted. Although I definitely enjoyed the movie, it felt extremely rushed, I truly enjoyed the elements from both Joss Whedon's ""Gifted"" storyline, and the Dark Phoenix saga. Overall, I left the theater feeling full of X-Citement (hah!) but upon reflection I couldn't help but feeling something was missing. Most negative comments I have read pertain to the overuse of special effects and the misuse of parts of the story. However, in order to create a film, especially one based on a comic book which has weaved an delicately balanced continuity (barely able to stand) over the last forty-three years, only certain elements can be chosen. One example is that, a love interest may be switched in order for it to fit the storyline. However, if I must make one angry statement, there are too many characters that are unnamed, unused, unnecessary, underplayed, and given no story. There are a multitude of main characters, that don't even get names. As a comic book fan, it is a bonanza of ""who was that supposed to be? and Oh, wow, they even stuck them in?! Hey, that's Psylocke!"" But as a movie fan, if I didn't know the story of the film, I might be saying, ""Who was the Asian chick with the purple hair, and why did she blend into the wall?"" Many have blamed it all on the film not being directed by Bryan Singer, well I'll give you this question. Is it not his fault since he chose to leave for ""Superman Returns""? (Which by the way looks like it's going to suck.)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Film,"I read a lot of reviews about this film, both good and bad. I have to say the people who didn't like this film because it was missing Gambit or because you felt that there was little character development are nuts. First off, this is a movie, not a comic book or a cartoon. Each character that is introduced costs the studio more money.I know thats may be a week defense for that argument, BUT remember that this is a film. And for a film to make money it not only has to appeal to the original fans of the comic, but it also has to make new fans and those fans will have to like the movie otherwise the movie will fail. With that being said you don't want to confuse the non-comic book fans by complicating the story.I thought the story was excellent. It followed the other 2 MOVIES very well. Yes the story did not follow the X-Men universe from the comic, but where not talking about a comic we're talking about a movie.I think the special effects where top notch and so was the direction. Don't listen to the nay sayers, this film was excellent. If you liked the other two films you'll love this final installment in the series.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I don't understand how you can't like this movie.,"Unless you were expecting it to stick to the actual phoenix saga which covered nearly 30 books then it should be a great movie to anyone, fans and newcomers alike. I would say it is an excellent end to a great trilogy of movies and it actually accomplished more X-men goodies in less time than its predecessors. The other movies were a tad slow and I always thought them kinda over dramatical in that sense, but this one preserved believability at a fast pace. I'll admit I thought X3 was kind of jumpy at the beginning when it jumped between three different time lines in the first few minutes, but it picked itself back up quickly and told a great epic in a solid two hours. I thought my money was well spent and I plan on going to see it a few more times before it leaves the theater.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good,"In some ways the best in the series; in some ways the worst. When a cure is found to treat mutations, lines are drawn amongst the X-Men, led by Professor Charles Xavier, and the Brotherhood, a band of powerful mutants organized under Xavier's former ally, Magneto. You could say that the film is built on a firm base, but it's also one big pile of self-obsession. It holds the attention but demands complete suspension of logic. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The Phoenix turn into a fiery Bird. But not in you movie. The Phoenix was a murderer. Jean killed Cyclops, then she Killed XAVIER. Then she tried to kill Wolverine. Comic book hero's are the savior of the world not love birds like Brad Pitt and Angelina. Why would you do that? The Bird guy wasn't a bird, he was a Fairy. He was the gayest Super Hero I even seen.

Let the fireworks begin!!!,"This one is the final battle featuring all of our favorite X-Men characters, is it? X-Men III is like Revenge of the Sith, where in the latest installment of the comic book franchise, this is a crowd pleaser. Bryan Singer, who donned the director's chair in the first two installments steps away as Brett Ratner of the Rush Hour franchise takes over.Picking up where X2 left off with the death of Dr. Jean Gray (Famke Janssen), the United States government has stated that they found the cure to all mutants: a child nickname Virus, who's blood not only can take away their powers, but when encounter face-to-face, the power of a mutant can be taken away temporarily. The process has started where after a government official (Michael Murray) discovers his son (Ben Foster) having wings on his back and can fly like a bird in the sky.Back in the school for the gifted, the other characters still mourn for the death of Dr. Gray as some of them try to get on with their lives, while others like Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Marsden) can't forget the past as conflicts arise between those in the school such as Rogue (Anna Paquin) and her boyfriend (Shawn Ashmore) falling for another mutant during target practice.Like each of the X-Men installments, we get a new set of characters who steal the movie scenes; while in the first sequel it was Kurt Wagner/Nightcrawler (played by Alan Cumming), in this installment we see Kelsey Grammar (Frasier) as Dr. Hank McCoy, better known to fans as Beast; Vinnie Jones as the barbaric Juggernaut, who cannot be touch or be damaged by any object; Ben Foster as Michael Warrington III, better known as Angel. Many more characters are mentioned, but like the films itself, it scrambles through so many people that we don't have time to know the others while the action takes place. But then again, it is great to see Hugh Jackman reprising his role as Wolverine; Halle Berry as Storm, Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, and Famke Janssen as Jean Gray, reprises from the dead as Phoenix whose powers are much more dangerous than the mutants around her as she can efface a person's flesh and blood into thin air.The plot to the original X-Men movie where it was mutant vs. mutant; the sequel involved mutants, both good and bad reuniting to fight for their species to survive; in this one it is again mutant vs. mutant where Magneto (Ian McKellan) leads his army of Brotherhood with Phoenix by his side and try to stop those who are against them along with the cure registration while the X-Men try to stop Magneto and his army of thugs from trying to kill people and at the same time, not let humanity drive them afraid.Despite what you think of my review, or hear what others say, X-Men III is a fantastic film, fully blooded with special effects where the roller coaster ride doesn't end. In general, this is the best way to end a great comic book trilogy! I wouldn't be surprise if more installments would be in the works!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What happened to the story?,"I saw this on the first night it was out, and I left feeling so disappointed. Something was missing, everything was missing. As afaithfulday noted, the first two movies were good, the third was mostly clichéd Hollywood crap. The only thing it had going for it was a little bit of suspense/tension, but that was not enough.In the first two movies, there was a resonating story, strong themes woven throughout. In this one, it seemed to be all about cramming in as many witty one-liners and special effects as possible. There were a few weak attempts at stringing a story together, but it was so choppy and rushed there was almost no continuity.

"great movie,like the first two","movie is great,shorter than i would like it to be,but i could watch new x-men movie every day and not every 3 years so this is my subjective opinion. end credits scene and scene where magneto is moving the chess figure gives me hope that there will be more of x-men movies with this great and some new actors. also i don't have a feeling that this is it and this few details give a hope to everyone that there will indeed be more movies and i hope sooner than 3 years. i also hope that movie will earn much money. i can't describe the feeling after i see the new x-men movie for the first time. it is similar with most of my favorite movies,like star wars,terminator and some more. i am very excited and cannot wait to see it but afterwards i am sad because the movie is over. there are probably more of people who have the same feeling. action scenes are maybe the best in all three x-men movies and there are definitely most mutant vs.mutant fights. i don't see why magneto didn't just eliminate wolverine and colossus at the end,but there wouldn't be such a good last fight scene then. wolverine is my favorite character and i think that Hugh Jackman did a great job and can't imagine anyone other taking that part. maybe he should have tried it with storm rather than jean,cause she's got a crush on him i think. and halle is much better than famkee.

"Fun, but leaves you wanting more.","X-Men was disappointing.Brett Ratner was a completely wrong choicethe film was being billed as something epic, yet the whole film was saturated with the same homogeneous emotion. There was no climax, no point at which the heart races. Instead of getting some intense, emotionally powerful film (which the story was perfectly capable of supporting), we get what is more like a dragged out television movie; the death scenes are anti-climactic, the story brief and episodic, and the effects sometimes cheesy and usually sub-par.The film does contain some good parts (I enjoyed the protests), but overall, it could have been better. Instead of a blockbuster that carried its audience along emotionally (Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope), it is a blockbuster that, like Star Wars Episode III: The Revenge of the Sith, is polished yet hollow, and like a mint flavored star burst, is enjoyable, but leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Out  Originality,"Ever get the feeling while watching a movie, the producers are growing complement and you can predict what's coming next? Such films like Rocky XII, the second or third Dirty Dozen, The last of the Dirty Harry stories, the Final Star Wars saga. they're all Representatives of Film Fatigue. Well that's what you'll get with X Men, The Last Stand. It isn't that the film isn't interesting, it is! But when you start seeing the Good Guys lose, the film starts to imitate the comics. I'm not saying that's bad either, it's good, but I suspect a set up. Stan Lee is an exceptional storyteller, but it's sneaky when a particular character or two is bumped off, right away. That implies a comeback is in the wings. Consider how Lucus did it in the original Star Wars when Darth Vader is flung into the spacial abyss. Neat trick, but necessary for a sequel. Here, two X-Men, join one already dead, or we viewers thought was dead. That smacks of a set up. How often do heroes have to destroy Freddy on Elm Street, Jason, or Michal Myers? The dam monsters just don't want to die. Good for money milking producers, but bad for viewers who seek originality. Now here we have, X-Men returning from the dead and this time joining the Bad guys in, yes, you guessed it, world conquest. Not original, but expected. Despite the fact we got mutants coming out of the woodwork and amassing into an army, the director sees fit to kill them off by the hundreds and in a variety of ways including one which eliminates their powers altogether just by contact. If you're interested in seeing leftover mutants from Star Trek, Star Wars, Twilight Zone, Outer Limits or other fantasy sites, this film is for you. If you're not that shallow, read a book. About the only redeeming character from the entire show, I give you Ian McKellen as Magneto. At least, we know he's originally sincere in his madness. ***",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Awesome,"It may be because this movie fits my demographic or perhaps because i love scifi and fantasy genre movies as long as they are good.Any way you swing it however, if you do not want to go see X3 in theaters but wish to see only the DVD when it may came out you're missing the whole experience.The emotional twists and turns that the film puts the viewer through cannot be summarized in one word...i don't think at least.I laughed, i almost cried and i shivered as the movie reached its climax. The lines were told at the perfect time, the acting was on par and the special effects were right up there where they should be.For the 1 hour and a half this movie has lasted everyone embarked a ride they have enjoyed throughly and to the end.

Great comic book movie minus Berry.,"X-Men: The Last Stand - The third and (possibly) final part to the X-Men series. A mutant ""cure"" is found, and then everything goes to hell. Magneto (the always wonderful Ian McKellen) gathers an army to destroy the source: a mutant boy named Leech. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his band of peaceful mutants hope to stop Magneto and blah blah blah. You get the picture. The story's much cooler in execution than on paper.Okay. The great things. Characters lose their powers. Characters die. And goodness knows there are a lot of them. Storm, Beast ,Wolverine (me fav), Collosus, Shadowcat, Iceman, Magneto, Pyro, Cyclops, Juggernaut (who almost steals the show with his one-liners) and best of all: Jean Gray (Famke Jannsen). I haven't even read half the list off, but you get the picture. Needless to say, with so many protagonists, some people's screen time is shunted over, but I don't really give a crap. If you've ever read the original comics, the fightscene pages were twice as spastic and crammed as this movie was.Kelsey Grammar and Hugh Jackman are wonderful as Beast and Wolverine. No wonder the latter's getting his own spin-off (I personally hope he's going to fight the Hulk). She's changed actresses three times over but ShadowCat (Ellen Page) finally gets to kick some ass. Jannsen is F***ing SCARY as Jean Gray/ Phoenix. This plot line in particular is well done.There's no cheesy ""coming out"" sequence like in #2. The action sequences were a blast.People were so afraid that Brett Ratner was going to screw up the movie. In my opinion he did better than Bryan Singer. There weren't so many stupid moments that caused me to shake my head. This was hard-hitting. Wolverine got to kill people. Favorite characters got to die. This was serious, and it really uped the ante knowing that no one was safe from termination. Well, everyone but Hugh Jackman, cause he rocks so damn much.Halle Berry can kick the bucket for all I care. She can use lightning but she's just not cut out for comic book movies. And can she STICK with an accent/hairstyle/place in the story? Jean Grey may change into Phoenix but Berry is the real re-inventor around here. I mean, now she can FLY and spin faster than a twister on crack? C'mon. Lets have some continuity here.A great comic book movie except for Halle Berry, X-Men:: The Last Stand gets an A- Now lets move onto that Wolverine movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing final of the trilogy!,"I saw this movie today and I think that is excellent. Spectacular visual effects, dynamic plot - all this components make this movie excellent final of the trilogy.To compare I can say that ""X-men: The Last Stand"" is better than ""Spider-man"" and ""Spider-man 2"" and is much better than ""Fantastic Four""( I think that ""Fantastic Four"" doesn't deserve attention ) .It's a pity that this film is the final about X-men's adventure, so I recommend you: don't go at ""Mission:Impossible 3"", don't go at ""Poseidon"", go at ""X-men: The Last Stand"" and enjoy one of the best(or even maybe the best) blockbusters of the summer!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"zero content, worse effect","it's a sad thing when a franchise like this scrambles the foundations of the comic mythology to the point of making it unrecognizable in its general elements. I feel comfortable writing about this because i never followed the comics, my contact with x-men always came from TV animated series, or the films.The x-men were based on a basic metaphor of being different. because you have a different characteristic, that doesn't mean it is bad. You have to learn who you are, and live with it. Ultimately, we're all mutants, who just have to acknowledge who we are. Understand our ""difference"", and our weaknesses, and explore them. So, the ordinary human being in the series, is the guy who normally won't cope with the difference. They simply won't understand it. That's where the mutant vs human thing comes up. And of course, mutant vs mutant, because some mutants won't understand and deal with rejection. Along the way, we'd get lots of effect, different characteristics, wings, adamantium, weather controlling powers, psychic mutants, magnetic ones, etc etc. the possibilities were endless.But here, everything is messed up. mutants manipulate mutants, and apparently every faction is ""just"" covering their own ass. There is no larger aspiration, no grander intentions. We are even taken away the mentor of the ""ideology of difference"" early at the beginning, Xavier. It's turned into a simple action flick, emptied in its original cosmology content, rather poor in terms of visual sequences, but still so expensive that one can not see it as the honest work of some b series lovers. So, we're left with nothing.My opinion: 1/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Lame real Lame,"The Xmen trilogy has deteriorated ever since its inception. X-Men was good, real good. X2 was also good with some parts of humor. X3 is real disappointing. It is filled with odd blocks of unexplained parts. Like how Scot dies ?? And whats so important with Angel ? And what was the history of the child ?? All these questions pop up and they are left unexplained. this will lead you to believe that the director would have sense to finish off the trilogy covering all ends, obviously he doesn't. I will not comment on the story, since the plot on IMDb tells it all, but really this movie stinks. Out of the blue Jean Grey appears all good and fine. I mean how come one could live for more than six months under water even if that person is a mutant ?? I am quite surprised to see this movie getting a 7.9. Really shocking. Saw DaVinci Code the same day and really loved that. Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman are superb. Especially Hugh Jackman, from start to finish he sets the tone of the movie. He sets the tone of the entire trilogy, come to think of it, cos he is the principle character in all of them. Ian McKellen is also brilliant, Rebecca Romijin Stamos in her small role is also charismatic as ever. Anne Pacquin is wasted, in her small miserable role. Halle Berry was also pretty decent. This movie features loads of new mutants but we miss a few of the old ones. Plus the movie goes on to feature a few mutants who never feature in the comics. May be Stan lee is thinking of adding new characters in his series. Gambon, who was thought to make an appearance in this movie earlier has been cut off, it would have been nice to see his charismatic dark side. Toad, Nightcrawler, all are missing.This movie just turns out to be yet another lame action flick. I would certainly not recommend anyone watching it.

Too Much on Ratner's Plate,"Okay....I will not begin by bitching about how the movie strayed far away from the previous two installments, or the comics in general. Wait a minute....I think I will. This movie began as being The Halle Berry Movie. She whined and complained during the previous two films about her character's lack of involvement. Well, she was able to hog all the camera time she wanted but was still a disappointment. Storm was still basically useless and Halle overreached WAY TOO MUCH! It seemed she wanted her character to be Halle Berry, not Storm and it was crystal clear to the viewers. Secondly, Professor X did nothing but wheel himself around and was inept to handle any situation. I thought he was the most powerful telepath in the universe. At least he is in the comics and it is the phoenix force that allows Jean Grey to surpass him (which was strangely absent in the film). Speaking of Jean Grey, she may have been reborn in the film, but her character had little change that I will not discuss. Don't get me wrong, I felt that the film had some excellent scenes but were given by CGI and not Ratner. Even people who know nothing of the X-Men except what they had seen in the previous two installments agreed that this movie was as fulfilling as a gimp winning a race. Ratner had way too much on his plate and was only able to finish a small portion of it. For a movie based upon a book with intricate plots and loved characters, this is unacceptable. I could rant forever about the disappointment I felt after leaving the theater and my rage would still be unsatiated.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great for a third installer.,"I got the chance to see it at the a charity screening here in Sydney Australia on the 22nd and i must say it is worth seeing if you've seen the last two or are a huge fan of the comics. Although it doesn't deserve full stars because it does lack quite a bit in the film. For one, fans who were hoping to see bigger roles out of character such as Professor Xavier, Colossus, cyclops or Iceman I'm afraid to tell you that they're under used in this great film. The story is great but Brett Ratner wasn't very good at achieving it as we see the film is very fast paced in the first half of the movie, no time to stop and take in everything that just happened, However the second half slowed down a lot allowing fans a little thinking time to keep up with whats happening and the special effects are much better than the last two. My personal problem was once again huge Jackman aka Wolverine hogged the light for almost 60% of the film followed by Halley berry aka storm who had some scenes i personally thought were unnecessary and could've been good for other characters. Ian McKellen didn't seem as convincing as magneto as he did in the last two, I mean he still had the personality but during the fights he seemed a bit lazy, he seemed out of time with the special effects. i won't go on but i recommend to all fans to see, by the way theirs only two words i guess you could say are swear word and no sex scenes for any one who's been wanting to know.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"No Emotional Weight, But Not As Bad As People Say","Continuing my plan to watch every Hugh Jackman movie in order, I come to X-Men: The Last Stand (2006)Plot In A Paragraph: The human government develops a cure for mutations, and Jean Gray becomes a darker uncontrollable persona called the Phoenix who allies with Magneto, causing escalation into an all-out battle for the X-Men.I like the moral conflict in this one, but it focuses too much on the action set pieces over the emotional storyline of the chance to be ""cured"" of their mutant gene. To start with Magneto has a valid point, but he essentially becomes a terrorist.All the returning cast are fine, whilst Kelsey Grammer is a welcome addition, as was Ellen Page, Vinnie Jones however is not.Rouge (such a big part of the first movie) is left in the background again in this one, which is a shame, as her story could have added some much needed emotional weight to the story.I don't think it's as bad as people say, but is easily the weakest on the three.X-Men: The Last Stand grossed $234 million at the domestic box office, to be the 4th grossing movie of 2006.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Excellently done, definitely go see","I don't know what everyone is complaining about. For most of the movie I was in awe and on the edge of my seat. The effects are breathtaking, and for the most part held true to the comics. I think people forget that this is only a movie that is two hours, and that it is impossible to fit everything from a multi-year comic book into such a short span of time. However, it was a lot better than I expected, and I can't see how anyone who saw it can possibly argue that it was anything short of wonderful. To a fan of the comics, it's everything we could have hoped for. The only way that you would find the plot to be convoluted would be if you were both unfamiliar with the comics and had never seen either of the first two installments.People are saying that too much emphasis is placed on wolverine's character once again. I think that only what is necessary is placed on his character, but that his involvement in the events at hand, demand that he maintain a prominent role. Storm finally gets more recognition as do the younger mutants. their characters become more developed, but further development had to be spared as to not complicate and stray from the plot. as i said before, people forget this movie cant be ten hours long, like it would be if they added every inconsequential tidbit to make everyone happy. they do a really good job of delving deeper into the character's lives in this one, than in either of the first two movies.In short, definitely go see it. Don't let these pompous critics make unfounded judgments, it was wonderfully done with careful detail and respect paid to the original works.

An explosion is worth a thousand lines of character development,"So I finished watching this movie and I can honestly say that it didn't work for me. One problem a movie of this size (in terms of cast) has is that you can't focus on anyone. Therein lies the problem - by the end of the movie, you don't feel anything for any of the characters. There are some scenes I didn't see coming, but they're dealt with quite heavy-handedly and don't have the shock-factor Ratner must have hoped.The story is pretty straightforward, but it all seemed like they got into a room, went ""Okay guys, we want this scene, this scene, this scene and this scene. How can we fit it together?"" The story doesn't really flow, and none of the characters are particularly well fleshed out. You can tell Halle Berry got her wish for increased screen time, and she was incredibly annoying, delivering a robotic performance in stark contrast to some of the other roles she's done.On the plus side: there were some nice references to the comics. Certain phrases and actions were straight out of the comics (Beast's entrance, the Fastball Special) which was good for me as a fan boy. Kelsey Grammar did an awesome job as Beast - he conveyed all the intelligence Beast is known for in the comics. Yes, he sounded like Frasier in a blue furry suit, but thats exactly who Beast is. So that worked well.I make the movie sound like a disaster, but it really wasn't that bad. A problem most trilogies face is that by the third movie, they've developed a good fan base, and the first two movies must have been well received. X-Men 2 was phenomenal and following up an act like that would be difficult for even the best directors and writers.I look forward to the directors edition. The addition of a few more scenes might flesh the movie out better so my above criticisms would be be moot.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Stunning special effects but not so stunning plot,"This film is a fiction/fantasy film about a group of mutants being hunt down by the government.The special effects are very stunning in this film. The anti gravity scenes are particularly well made in the film.However, I think the story is a bit fragmented. It could be because I cannot remember the previous 2 X Men films very well, so I could not completely relate to this film completely. I find the plot a bit complicated. So there are two group of mutants who are against each other, and then the government is hunting both of them down, and then there is a mutant called Jean who wants to kill everyone?! This plot is far too complicated. The characters are not developed so much either, maybe it is because it is assumed that the viewers have watched and remembered what happened in the previous 2 X Men films.It is still a very watchable film, quick paced action without any boring scenes.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The most disappointing.,"When comic books turn into movies, there's always an element lost in translation, a storyline that gets touched upon, parts that get torn out or missed, or even completely ignored. It's part of the whole formula that makes it cater to broad audiences that don't read comic books, that always have fans of whatever series is coming to the screen upset that specific parts are left out.And that's where X3 leaves me. When I'd heard that they were visiting the Phoenix story in this film, I wondered how exactly they would be able to fill a whole movie with the story, and not let most people down.The basics of the story are covered, sure, but the character issue is there, that half of the things that would be important had they been signed on for more than three movies are completely and utterly tossed aside.Now, I can live through that. But what I can't live through are the lines given to Halle Berry. She said she wouldn't sign on unless she had more lines, they say. It's funny, because the lines they've given her are almost exactly the kind of terrible one-liner clichés that she'd had throughout Catwoman, and I found myself shaking my fist every time she came to the screen.So terrible, so very terrible.On the other hand, there were some really great parts. Beast (Kelsey Grammar) was fantastic, Logan was great, Shadowcat (now that she has LINES!) was great, and Magneto was also fantastic. The rest of the characters were boring, silly, stupid, and not very much fun to watch.This my friends, is the worst of the three movies. Plot flies by with nary too much weight, story lines don't develop very well, and some of the fight scenes are boring.Sad to think that when I'd told people I'd seen this movie that I was more excited seeing the trailer for Snakes on a Plane, than actually talking about the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Brett Ratner instead of Bryan Singer. Alarming. Very.,"Brett Ratner instead of Bryan Singer. Alarming. Very. Brett Ratner is a guy who copies other directors' styles and makes mediocre movies (read ""Red Dragon"", where he copied Jonathan Demme and gave the film a generous portion of Ridley Scott). I didn't hate ""Red Dragon"", it just was what it was. Mediocre at best.He entered the project a year and a half ago, to replace Bryan Singer. Zak Penn and Simon Kinberg wrote a script in zero time that seems to work just fine. And that's pretty much what Ratner puts up there on the screen: a movie that works just fine. Let's not get too enthusiastic.On the flip-side we've got some of the performances. Of course, Halle Berry, is just a crashing bore. Her character Storm plans to take over after Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). This is a complete miscalculation by the filmmakers, as nobody really likes Storm. Storm's prominent role in the series has to do with Halle Berry's (undeserved) star status.Some of the mutants in the Brotherhood are really colorless, but I guess that's bound to happen as they are the villain's henchmen (and the movie only has 104 minutes at its disposal). In the first movie Singer used a couple of villains that worked great. In Penn and Kinberg's script there's a little too much going on, and too many characters - and so little time. I guess that's what happens when the production team has got 14 months to make a worthy sequel. They do succeed though - kind of. But they do not excel.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The saga comes to an end,"X-Men: The Last Stand The film starts off at around where the second one left off, right after the supposed death of Jean Grey. But we soon discover that she has returned in all her glory (and an uncontrollable one at that). Among other things, a pharmaceutical company has developed a way to suppress the mutant X-gene and Magneto won't allow it. He starts gathering an army to make a stand against the humans.All of the X-Men that we've grown to love over the course of the past two films are back in this one, in addition to a whole bunch of new ones. Wolverine is still himself but I feel that they overdid it with his cockiness. Storm is beautiful but there isn't anything that special about her. And there are of course the grand old men, Magneto and Xavier who despite trying, aren't quite as good as they were in the previous installments. As for the newcomers, the one I liked the most was Beast played by Kelsey Grammar.The storyline has got some good ideas in it but those aren't put to the best use. With the film's 104 minute running time, a whole half hour shorter than X2, everything feels rushed. They could have told a much better story if they had taken some time to go deeper into things but instead they got this huge film but then showed us only a little bit of everything but not enough of anything that would satisfy the audience.Some may blame this (and other) shortcomings on director Brett Ratner who took over after Bryan Singer left to do Superman Returns. But I say blame screenwriter Simon Kinberg who has also given us such turkeys as XXX2 and Charlie's Angles 2. As is trademark for him, the dialog is awful and way too cheesy and the storyline has quite a few plot holes and leaps of logic. With the material given, Ratner did a fine job. Not the best possible but still pretty good. The action was there but at times felt somewhat rushed and it simply didn't have the impact that it did in the first two. The special effects were good but nothing special. At times they almost felt a little dull. The cinematography, which according to IMDb was done by both Phillipe Rousselot and Dante Spinotti is OK but doesn't quite reach the levels that Tom Siegel achieved on the first two films. John Powell's soundtrack goes from some nice combos of choir and orchestra to some very boring and generic orchestral.Overall, a pretty good film if it didn't have the excellent X1 and X2 to live up to but since that is taken into consideration, a bit disappointing. Not the best way to end an otherwise great series like this.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This film had so much potential to be the best,"You would think that the final installment of the X-men would be the best out of the trilogy, and you would walk away from the theater feeling complete. Sadly, I wasn't. This film had so much potential to be the best but it failed. Although it does have some exciting and entertaining action moments, some cheesy one-liners and elements of the storyline can't be ignored that contributed to its failure.Let's start with the good. Storm is my favorite X-men character so I was glad to finally see her take on a more important role, as well as see her use her powers to the max, combined with some fist-fighting action. I loved the opening scene where we see Prof. X and Magneto as friends, who have come to Jean Grey's house when she was a child. It showed another side of their relationship that made you understand Magneto more, especially after Prof. X died and Magneto scolds Pyro by saying he regrets that Prof. X had to die for their dream to live. The way he says this line is more mournful rather than evil in my opinion. I also enjoyed the battle between Iceman and Pyro, and seeing Iceman become all ice was thrilling. The scenes with Angel were great as well but I wish the character was used more in action scenes, instead of just flying across the sky (although these shots were beautiful).But while these scenes were fun to watch, the film lacked emotional value that made the first two (especially the second) so strong. With the premise being that there is a cure for mutants, and what mutants think about it, the emotions should be the strongest out of the three but it was weak. You see hints of it but it is then never completed. For example, at the last minute Angel doesn't want the cure and he quickly but strongly counters his dad, before flying out the window. Storm explaining how mutants are not a disease, and that they shouldn't get the cure also are small glimmers into their emotions.The real character who should be the strongest in all this is Rogue, but her crisis seems to rushed and predictable. Of course we know she would want the cure the most...so she can finally touch people without worry of killing them. There's more added pressure because she has a boyfriend (Bobby/Iceman) and he seems to be begging for something more intimate, especially as we see him become closer with another mutant Katie, and the skating scene says it all. It is that scene that sparks Rogue to leave and get the cure. But even a small talk with Wolverine (her first mutant friend) can't stop her or rethink the situation. She still gets the cure. Yet even at the end, Bobby isn't all happy or excited. Does he even love her or respect her decision at this point? In my opinion, the film might have been better if Rogue didn't get the cure because being a mutant is who she is (no matter what their power). Additionally, her power could have been very useful during the final battle, especially when Phoenix seemed to be going on a rage destroying things. As a result, I was really disappointed I didn't get to see Rogue in more action scenes since she didn't have many in the first two.Other disappoints were the character Night-crawler was completely absent. I don't know if they couldn't get the actor who played him but Night-crawler still should have been in the film, continuing from the second. Same for Cyclops. Why did Wolverine have to be the one who saves Jean when Cycops is the one who loves her, and Jean loves back. Cyclops was barely in the film, and his only role in the film was that Jean killed the man she loved because she couldn't control her powers (the Phoenix). Hope, faith, and love were values made apparent in the first two and hardly developed in the third. Sure, Wolverine killed Jean because he loves her but why couldn't Jean overpower the Phoenix within herself because of her love for Scott/Cyclops? Just a thought.While the film was still enjoyable and raises a lot of questions and issues, it had so much potential to be the best in the trilogy but in my opinion, it wasn't. At least X3 isn't the only comic book movie this summer, so there's still hope for a good one.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

X-men 3,"I liked a lot of things in this film, and hated just as many. I went and saw it on the midnight showing baring a false hope for this film to have the same fell to it as the first two. I knew that Ratner had taken on this project and loved all of his films he had done to date(Rush Hour, Rush Hour 2, Red Dragon). I thought that I was even lucky to get such a good seat at the showing. I sat own watched the starting, which started like the others had(for the most part). As I watched certain characters die that I had come to get used to in the previous films, I noticed that someone had sat in front of me with a giant afro. While I struggled to see the WHOLE screen, I realized that the story was not worth struggling for. So as the movie went on, I really just waited for the action, which at times was a let down as well. But mostly a great achievement. I go a little too far when I say i struggled to see. But I did only see about 2/3 of the screen. My point is, that when watching a more story worthy film, I might have struggles to see the other 1/3 of the screen for the rest of the time. Overall, it really fell victim to the it's publicity. I had such high expectations going into it, that it did hurt my review of the film a little. The most annoying part came when ....SPOILER..........the Brotherhood was taking the bridge, and as they got to Alcatraz....it went night-time. Just another overlooked, or lazy decision on Ratner's part.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why is this movie so hated?,"X-Men The Last Stand is the third of the original X-Men movie trilogy. Often ridiculed for not being as good as the first two, this movie carries our favorite mutants to the next level of their continuing story. This movie is much better than the maligning critique it carries. But why is it so hated? A couple reasons come to mind.First, Bryan Singer, who directed the first two, and other X-Men movies after, is missing from the director's chair. Brett Ratner sits in his place and many people were initially dismissive of this film purely based on this fact. Brett Ratner carries this film in a very skillful way. He respects the characters every bit as much Bryan Singer has. He tells this tale like a man who has grown up reading the comics, takes a script, and applies his favorite characters' tales to the new version of the story in front of the cameras, rather than on pulp. It is unfair to fault this movie just because of a change of director.Second, this movie covers the Dark Phoenix Saga in a way that is quite a departure from the comic books. For those that don't know, Jean Grey, aka Marvel Girl, is also the Phoenix. In this film, her mutant powers are beyond any and all. She can do things that no other mutant can. As these powers have been long dormant, she is feral and uncontrolled. This differs slightly from the comics, as on paper, the Dark Phoenix has the power of a god, or goddess. Many who have problems with this movie feel cheated. They expected the Dark Phoenix they read in the comic books. What these naysayers don't realize is certain things work well on pages, but not necessarily on film. To take the established X-Men and put them up against a person with cosmic powers just would not work. The movie would be over before the beginning credits finished. She's THAT powerful. Now, in this movie, Jean is beyond anything we have ever seen. The movie version works for the established universe and should be respected for what it is.I offer no spoilers. This movie stands with the other two X-Men movies. It is quite good, if slightly flawed. It deserves our respect. People who love the X-Men would do well to see beyond the absence of Bryan Singer and the presence of a different version of the Dark Phoenix. If given a chance, one just may allow themselves to enjoy X-Men The Last Stand. It deserves the opportunity to be liked and appreciated.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Over-done conclusion.,"The final (?) movie in the X-men series was a bit disappointing. Where the two first movies were subtle and had rather good character development, this episode was over the top with silly one-liners and an endless gallery of characters that could populate a small city.The main cast, however, is overall great: Famke Janssen is stunning as the tormented Jean Grey, while Hugh Jackman is tougher than ever, and Kelsey Grammar is perfectly cast as Beast. Patrick Stewart (as always) delivers a great performance, while Ian McKellen as Magneto is good, but the one-liners he gets makes Magneto a parody of himself.In my opinion, X-men 3 lacked the finesse of the two predecessors: Magneto has become a true megalomaniac lacking the intelligent sense of logic he used to have, and where we previously were left to ponder and really feel with the characters (as in the complex friendship of Wolverine and Rogue), we are faced with an endless list of more and more powerful mutants with no function in the story, other than making Halle Berry as Storm look puny with her fog and lightning.Moreover, I felt that the violence became a bit too extreme: There is simply too much killing in this movie. Perhaps it was supposed to make the story more grave and powerful. However, the story is after all based on a comic with silly super-heroes in colored spandex suits, and violence was always very superficial in the comics. But here, bystanders and more or less innocent people are killed off without as much as a flinch.A really entertaining movie, nonetheless, but not a very satisfying conclusion to the otherwise indisputably best super hero comic-adaptation series to date.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Excellent, perfect and fantastic","Wow I've never toughed that, especially with the new director, that it could amaze me like it did!The storyline was more then fantastic. The special effects blew me of my seat... never loved a cast essemble morethen the x-men actors and the twists and surprises in the movie were really unexpected! :-) wow I enjoyed the movie even more then i enjoyed the previously x-men! I really hope there will be a fourth one.. hopefully with the same great cast! Femke and Hally are sow enjoyableHugh is such a great actor and the humoristic twist that he gives to wolverine is fantastic!The introducing of new characters was enjoyable... i wish I was one of the x-men... with those powers..The only thing that bodered me a little bit... was that mystique was only in the movie for maybe an half an hour.Can't wait for the next one!Ow and go see it with someone who appreciates the x-men sage coz I didn't and it really annoyed me!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why all of the hate?,The first X-Men movie was just okay (so-so)The second X-Men movie was really-really goodBut the third X-Men movie was the best of the series.These movie kept getting better with each new one that they made. Usually it works the other way around. X3 was great. I was however surprised when some of the main characters were killed off early in the movie.::::::::spoiler alert:::::::::: Dr. Jean Grey has been resurrected from the dead and now she has the personality of the Pheonix spirit that has taken over her personality. In other words she becomes evil. and Megneto and his band of outlaw the Mutants rally around her and create chaos. and its up to the last remaining/surviving X- Men to stop her.this movie is way better than either of its prequels ... this movie is great. It is a must see for any fan of comic book movies or superheros.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X Not for Extraordinary,"Often derided as a cheap shot at bandwagon tactics, the major studios' predilection towards churning out comic-inspired releases has at least given audiences the acceptable X Men series.Unlike quickly-assembles disappointments in the vein of Catwoman, Daredevil and Spiderman 2, the three X's thus far have been successful in maintaining plausible levels of entertainment value for the movie-going masses while avoiding outright ridicule, as unfortunately has come to pass with some of the others mentioned above.Although X2 and its sequel, the new Last Stand, have fallen short of their original compatriot, the first X Men title, they both largely live up to their promises, and in fact the latest installment surpasses its predecessor in production finesse and wealth of characters.This attribute certainly serves as X3's primary advantage, in that the movie dishes out mutants like there's no tomorrow. Although subsequently they each suffer from lack of individual exposure and development, heroes and villains alike go about their souped-up antics with wild abandon befitting a carefree summer outing.In addition, the humans are no longer mere puppets at the whim of superior beings, as even Magneto himself notes when saying: ""finally, they've learned"". Yes, unlike the two previous chapters, X3 boasts ""normal"" humans both capable in their handling of the mutant issue and generally free of nefariously devious ulterior motives. Thus, gone are the conspiratorial undertones found in the other X forays, paving the way for more head-on, straight-faced action than formerly the norm.Sadly, though, much like X2, this one also lacks the first movie's superb setup of the X universe, as it does the witty one-liners, particularly from Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, who by now has become rather flaccid and quite a departure from his vicious self of six years ago.No matter, for with excellent cameos from a whole slew of mutants to spruce things up the overall winding down effect noticeable in the franchise seems less formidable. Callisto (voluptuous Dania Ramirez who you may remember from Spike Lee joints 25th Hour and She Hate Me), Angel (Ben Foster, the villain in Hostage) and beautiful Kea Wong as brief but delectable Jubliee all contribute volumes to X3's content, making it more the comprehensive compendium of characters devotees no doubt have been eager to see for years now.As a last stand for the series, we could have hoped for much more but also for much, much worse, as when it comes to mainstream action storytelling, mediocrity rears its ugly head with the variety of wild abandon you'd expect from marmots on speed. Therefore X3 amounting to little more than a showing in force of as many members of the X Men pantheon as possible is no bad thing.At X3's core lies a parable close once more to the moralistic allegories we have previously found in the original X film: a cure has been found for the mutant ""disease"" by benevolent human scientists, yet the question remains as to who'd want to be cured and why in the first place.Deeming this a threat, a resurgent Magneto (Ian McKellen) assembles around his attractive self an army of ticked-off mutants bent on pre-empting human advancements. These include several regulars, like Rebecca Romjin's Mystique, but also memorable newcomer Juggernaut (big screen pseudo-hooligan Vinnie Jones) and fire-tastic Pyro (Aaron Standford).Standing up to this massing threat and for all things pro-choice, Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) rallies his own forces back at Mutant Academy, this time to encompass a more eclectic roster, albeit one allowing each member the bare minimum of screen time. Even stalwarts Wolverine, Storm (Halle Barry), Cyclops (Scott Summers) and Rogue (Anna Paquin) either exit prematurely or are displaced immediately after putting in their two cents, and not all even get a shot at flexing their respective mutant muscles.Only Famke Janssen's bifocal rendition of Dr. Jean Grey/Phoenix really receives significant stretches of limelight, but one must resent the writers' decision to make her nigh on invincible yet ultimately a none-event, a plot device of somewhat inexplicable futility.Fortunately such false build-ups do not typify the movie as an entire product. It bypasses the flatlining so common in action serials which have outlived their usefulness, mostly thanks to competent action directing and effects that aren't always overwhelming, even when Jean Grey's comeback gets so powerful she's easily despised, much as was the case with Keanu Reeves' Neo by the final Matrix movie.Another player in this tangled plot of genetic hyperbole who comes close to being a well-rounded persona is Kelsey Grammar's Beast, a.k.a. Dr. Hank McCoy. Not merely another academic in the X Men universe's endless array of college-educated mutants parading around the world with titles attached, Beast sheds more light on a real-life aspect of mutant existence, serving as a diplomat and the government's newly-appointed secretary of mutant affairs (a nod to Native-American social standing and political situation, presumably). When he finally parts with bureaucracy and dons the mantle of bestial mutation in the fight against Magneto's cadres, the result comes across as quite gratifying.There's little doubt Last Stand won't be entered into historical records as the most cerebral actioner ever, yet its own X marks an improvement over the 2003 precursor and also a step-up for director Bret Ratner, who's done us a tad prouder with X3 and may at long last be rid of the buddy-cop comedy stigma haunting him since the Rush Hour days. In that, Last Stand buttresses projects like After the Sunset, which has already tagged Ratner as a more serious action director.Definitely an improvement for series aficionados and general viewers over the sophomore release, X3 doesn't match high standards set by franchise progenitor X Men but nonetheless caters to those craving an action-dominated distraction with just the most modest splashes story and a hefty dose of entertaining characters.Rating: * * *",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The best of the 3,"This is a thoroughly entertaining movie worth the $10 admission (depending on where you live). I am a big fan of the genre, and I am familiar with the X-Men (but by no means an expert). When I saw the first in theaters, I thought it was a decent movie but by no means lived up to my expectations. My opinion towards the second was pretty much the same, so I resolved to keep my hopes down for the third. Sure enough, this one pretty much commits the same major errors of the first two, but is much better in terms of pure action entertainment. In short, many of the characters are underdeveloped/grossly different from the comics, the dialog is mediocre, and the plot is far from air-tight. However, the action leaves little to be desired; it is a fun way to spend an evening, if not deeply moving or artistically inspiring.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better After the End Credits...,"First - I want to address everyone who's already seen X-MEN: THE LAST STAND. If you left during the end credits (or even earlier, as did some viewers in the show I attended), you missed something that easily raised my vote half a star or so: the last scene of the movie.If you haven't seen THE LAST STAND, make sure you SIT THROUGH THE CREDITS. I'm not going to give anything away, but I think it's worth the extra few minutes. It's interesting that more and more films do have something during, in the middle of, or after the end credits. Since I sit there until the house lights go up or the film runs off the reel, it feels more like a bonus feature, just for a patient moviegoer. But in this case, it's a crucial scene, left quite literally for the very end.Director Brett Ratner has a strong action film background which includes the RUSH HOUR series, and there's some very solid action sequences here. As a kid reading The X-Men comics, it was really the fight scenes that kept me turning the pages. The film media lends itself perhaps even more to that kind of physical storytelling. THE LAST STAND does not disappoint in this area.Personally I think this franchise needed at least one entry that was firmly planted in the action category and THE LAST STAND is it. What I hope is that it doesn't become the rule, and that more character driven sequels are in its future. There are now a wealth of superheroes (and villains) presented to us in this X-Men series, and we could stand to learn a lot more about each of them.This time, however, story wasn't the point, as much as it was a tool to setting up the action. It's almost a Hong Kong martial arts approach; a bridge just to get you to the next fight scene. But with actors like Ian McKellan, those bridges seem much more rewarding. Honestly, he's such a solid Magneto that much of the film owes him a lot for holding things together when the plot gets flimsy. Kudos also to casting Kelsey Grammar as one of my favorite old-time X-Men, Beast. He was spot-on, in my book, and seeing Beast and Angel finally brought into the film story just made it feel complete in a way the other two movies did not.In making movies out of other media like comic books, there's always going to be some fairly severe story compression. In that process, characters are often quite distorted from their original print versions, and I understand anyone who has objections about how Iceman or any of the other characters have been treated in this series with regard to origins, respective ages, and so on. I admit my own disappointment in the handling of Juggernaut, who could have been a plot point, not to mention a deeper character, all on his own. And I've never liked the way Cyclops has been portrayed in any of the films, though I don't believe the problem is with actor James Marsden, but rather how his character has been written.Rather than debate those details and give anything away, I'll just say that film is not the printed word (or the well-drawn comic), and there are always concessions. This is not the most serious or character rich entry into the series, but it's a lot of fun, especially if you want to play ""spot the superhero or villain"". There are certainly more of them here than the other 2 films combined. And many film goers, who are unfamiliar with the comic stories, won't be bothered by any of the omissions or deviations from the comics.So if you're expecting the kind of serious approach present in the recent BATMAN BEGINS, this isn't really in that league. If, however, you're looking for an amped up action entry and like the Marvel characters, this is probably going to be a good night out. Make sure to get there early enough to see the 20th Century Fox fanfare (with the slightly lingering ""X""), and don't leave during the end credits, or you'll miss the end of the movie!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Excellent night at the movies for fans of explosive action,"I'm not going to review X3, there are plenty of other reviews out there. X3 was a very satisfying action flick that made for a great Friday night at the movies, and I will certainly be renting it on DVD to watch again on my home theater.The audience obviously loved it, the theater was packed and responded to the movie from beginning to end. Usually I'm annoyed by ""loud"" audiences, but in this movies case I didn't mind, because X3 is all about being a fun movie. Fans who gave X3 one star reviews, warning others not to go see it... that's kind of like dissing Aliens because you're a fan on Alien. Ten stars from me, there are only a couple of action movies per year that are of this caliber.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-men Halle Berry's revenge.,"We'll what can I say for X-men the Last stand, but that it was about what I would expect from a person like Brent Ratner. Brent Ratner to me is one of those directors that knows what it takes to make a summer movie make money, but doesn't have the kahuna's to take it a step farther, and explore his real talent. Everybody hates on Brent but if you have seen movies like Family man and Red dragon it shows that he has a good directing talent, and a good eye for the camera. I guess all the boozing, women and fast cars are more important.Everything about X-men the last stand seems to want to bring you in to the x-men world but for some reason you still feel like that outsider that sees a major accident, and slows down to watch. Don't get me wrong there was some good things in the movie, but the whole phoenix story should have been made as it's own story and movie, and instead on the mutant cure and making Jean Grey more of a side note.I did think the story they used was a pretty good story, and fit into the whole X-men mythology. The whole cure aspect is almost what the Brotherhood of Mutant's has been fighting for decades. That was fine for me and the pacing even though it was short was well done. That's the problem thought the length of the movie should have been longer given characters like Angel and Jagguarnaut and even Jean grey more room to breath. I think the Angel character and even Jaggarnaut are classic fun characters.The major problem of this movie though is that it doesn't fell all there, it feels like it's missing so much. I remember seeing X-men for the first time, and thinking wow besides the fact of a couple small things this feels like X-men it's fun and wow that's really cool. X-men 2 improved and it was like holy crap that's fn awesome, but X-men 3 just doesn't do it it's almost like the cast and crew were rushed, and from I what I read that may not be too far off the point.Now to the summary X-men Halle berry's revenge. Why doesn't it surprise me that when Halle Berry want's here way she get's it. To me personally Storm has never been a good character too me. Just didn't like, her character seemed to fake to me. Not only that but the fact the Halle Berry demanded a bigger part or she would not return is ludicrous to me. Actors and Actresses these day's forget there old days when it use to be fun for them. Hey I like to have money and I feel I should get some recognition for things, but I just can't see myself getting like that. Damn you Halle Berry.Overall finishing up my thought's of X-men the Last stand I will definitely say see it as a popcorn movie and not as a hard core comic fan because if you are that hard core fan then you will want to shoot Brent Ratner for his interpretation of a famous comic series. Other wise see it for what it is a flawed but half way decent action movie.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What a film!,"I have just returned from a screening an hour ago. What a magnificent addition to the x-men series of movies. The action was fast moving and the visuals truly graphic. The cast was superbly brilliant. I think there is more than enough scope for x-men 4 and 5. Famke is starting to show her age on the close up shots. Nevertheless, she retains a flawless physique. I would like to see more of her in future films. The new players were fantastic and will make for good spin off series. I loved the special effects and plot lines.

"Different, but pretty good","I saw a viewing of X-Men: The Last Stand the day after it came out. I must say, that it lived up to my expectations. Most people say that Brett Ratner ruined the series by making this movie. They are wrong. If people actually watch and learn, there is a moral in this movie. The plot of the third movie is that there is a ""cure"" for mutancy. Some mutants rejoice and take the cure willingly, others are outraged and want to destroy it. If you had mutant abilities that made you different, would you really want to take away what made you different? The other aspects make this movie enjoyable. There is not a lot of character development, as lots of new characters are put in and some characters are drastically underused. Even though this movie was not as good as the second one, it is worth seeing.*** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
so so with crappy ending (disapointed),I'm going to make this short (since there are MANY with my same views) if your loyal to the comics in any way you would think this movie is BS (more so then x1/x2) and with the deaths of so many mutants. The ending made me want to juke a little. What where they thinking!!! Man they mess up rogue so bad... and where the hell is gambit?? Just horrible. The story line was OK but a lot of things were left out. Things that people who don't read the comic wouldn't know. And the way they tie all of it up was just not right. Just not cool to whoever made this movie.They should of got someone who acctuly read the comics to make this movie. THis movie leaves a bad after taste.,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"All the Strong Points there, except the Music Score","I was delighted to see my fears were unfounded as the 3rd outing still had something new to offer, except for periods where it felt like ""X Men: 90210"". There were imaginative set pieces, huge plot twists, a good amount of Wolverine, and the ""Mutants are People too"" vibe. What kept it from being a gripping and driven film is the absence of a compelling score (see IMDb trivia about this movie and ""Superman Returns""). It is easy to tell when a movie is not greater than the sum of it's parts. I think of ""U.S. Marshalls"", the sequel to ""The Fugitive""; there was something not quite there in the pacing, or in the framing of the shots, or the subtlety in the lighting. There are few FX shots that are that kind of 'wow' these days, and only near the end do the fireworks really begin.However, the script was thankfully bulletproof. With all characters well established, the arc of each character's stories are exciting to watch, and I can only say that the Blue Beast was too boring to justify the amount of screen time given. Here the Hairy over-sized cookie monster has to muddle through boring C-SPAN political dullness that gave me flashbacks of the Intergalactic Senate in the ""Star Wars"" prequels. None of that procedural mumbo jumbo carries an ounce of the story's momentum. Whatever is discussed can just be recapitulated as a CNN news report, or in a few lines of dialogue.But back to the Music Score, John Powell's bland scoring was lacking when the right moment was needed, or, the film mix needed tweaking. Actually, the showing I was at had some sound glitches in the beginning two reels, so that may have been a factor as well. I think the story material more than makes up for the weaknesses, and you may find yourself choking a tear or two. I recommend those who have seen the other X Men movies to go see how the X Men world turns.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Actually pretty exciting, if you can get past the comic stuff","OK, so a lot of reviewers are saying that this was pretty sub-standard. In my own view, I would say that it pretty much succeeds in achieving what it aims to do, and I would definitely watch a sequel to it.Ratner definitely will annoy some comic fans for sure: there are some pretty big deaths that you have to wonder about. I also probably didn't like the way the Phoenix saga was handled here either, but it's not all about comics.In the end, at least for the most part, everything is well done. The dialogs was fine, and probably better then the other films in some ways. The film never dragged, the effects were well done, and the storyline was reasonably well established.It certainly could have been done a lot better, but enjoyed this a great deal more then some of the other blockbusters out recently. This is a worthy sequel, so don't hesitate to check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Save The Best for (The) Last (Stand).,"In this amazing third entry to the X-Men franchise, a man named Warren Worthington invents a cure for mutation. This angers Magneto, so he gains an army hundreds strong to tackle the problem from its source, a young mutant. However, the X-Men, who have been facing dark times after the return of Jean Grey (now the evil Pheonix), are banding together to fight Magneto one last time, and stop the cure from going into production. This is the best of the three movies due to it's great plot, the extravagant action scenes brought by new director Brett Ratner, and the addition of several new mutants.This X-Men film has a great plot that couples amazing action sequences with a real story that involves all sorts of conflict from the X-Men to the Brotherhood, Jean Grey to herself, and the humans to the mutants. The political and real life subtexts are too many to count, and it gives the film a more emotional base. You actually have to stop and think that if this was really happening, what side would you be on? This movie has many plot points that you're not expecting to happen, and it makes the film really exciting to watch. Screenwriters Zak Penn and Simon Kindberg take advantage of the fact that this is the last film in the trilogy by tying up all of the characters' story lines. I can't tell you exactly what happens, but some characters die, while some characters discover new sides to themselves. The series really ends nicely...Until the last scene, and an extra scene after the credits where it leaves it wide open for a 4th entry, even though we know the 4th entry won't come.The new mutants in this film are very well handled by the actors playing them, and it makes really interesting characters. Kelsey Grammar's Beast is as great on screen as on the comic page. He played him perfectly. I was worried that Dr. Fraiser Crane wouldn't be able to pull off Beast's brute fighting skill, but when that time came, my jaw dropped at how cool it was. The only mutant I had a problem with was Angel, who was over-hyped in the trailer and yet only had two scenes. Magneto showed some new tricks in this film, including one with the Golden Gate Bridge, and it was amazing to watch.

Good but Not Great,"After thoroughly enjoying the last episode and the tantalizing hint of the rise of the Dark Phoenix at the end of the film, I was looking forward to this entry. The previews featuring Angel spreading his wings, Wolverine slashing away, and Storm flying through the air like a dervish looked irresistible.Having just watched it however, all I can say is ""Eh"" (with a capital E mind you). The film has a lot going for it and some of the bigger special effects set-pieces are truly awesome in their power. So why do I feel like I just had dinner at a fast food restaurant? Actually, the film is like meeting a really attractive, intelligent person and hitting it off only to walk away from the encounter and realizing you had no emotional response whatsoever (and trouble remembering the person's name). Characters die (some literally evaporate before our eyes), battles are waged and things fly all over the place but, there doesn't seem to be a connection to the heart of the movie; which is definitely there but unattainable. At it's best though, there are some great scenes involving Cyclops, Wolverine and Phoenix but far too often I found myself wondering - wait a second - did that person die and if so, how come nobody on the screen seems to be too torn up about it? In fact, the movie eventually ramps up and moves at such a fast clip that by the end I found myself wondering what happened to Pyro, how come Angel only shows up for such a brief time in the entire film, and what the heck was that post-credit tag-on all about? Again, a good film and worth an hour and forty minutes of the your time if you're looking for a fun action film. X-Men purists beware though - major plot changes have been made to the original Dark Phoenix storyline and I don't think necessarily for the better.All in all, I'm curious to see if the DVD turns up with some missing footage because this film only suffers from what's missing - not what's on the screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The director wasn't an x man fan,"Sadly, the director of this movie was not a fan of the X men phenomenon. Was it really necessary to decimate the cast in such a clumsy and heavy handed way. Cyclops' demise was so sudden and unheralded that one couldn't help but imagine that there had been some contractual dispute between the actor and the filmmakers. Mystique has undoubtedly been one of the stars of the series, but alas, transformed into a common check out girl with barely a moments pause. Xavier's battle for the sanity of Jean Gray should have been the centre piece of the movie, but he was killed off half way though with barely a whimper and you were left wondering what might have been. The hint from earlier in the film that Xavier may shift his dying consciousness into the body of someone else (like the man dying of cancer) didn't materialise in the movie, and since the chances of a fourth movie seem remote the introduction of that possibility seemed like a directorial oversight. Jean Gray's tortured & psychotic character was in many ways excellent and beautifully shot, a blend of Carrie and Exorcist, but unfortunately we didn't see enough of the real Jean Gray, and too much of Pheonix standing around looking moody but doing not much else. The end scene did redeem it somewhat, however again it would have been nice to have seen some more of the real Jean, perhaps coming to terms with the enormity of what she had done. (kill her lover and mentor) All we got was a slight misting over of the eyes.If this film is the last in the series then there are too many loose ends and unanswered questions. This is a big let down for fans, because it seems to me that the makers have done this deliberately in case they are able to find enough money to throw at the cast to convince them to make a fourth movie. If they can't then that's that, and that shouldn't really have been good enough for this director.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Spectacle Trumps Content,"Fans of Bryan Singer's X-Men franchise may be somewhat disappointed by Brett Ratner's ""The Last Stand."" The reason is not that Ratner is incompetent as a director, but rather that his film simply suffers from a case of plot overload. Had the film been a little longer, then this problem may have been a non-issue, but for ""The Last Stand,"" at only 104 minutes, to achieve successful storytelling, convincing character development (of more than a dozen central characters no less), and extraordinary action sequences it would need a miracle. That being said, ""X3"" is still immensely entertaining and features some of the most eye-popping special effects of the year.When Ratner and his geek squad went about making and writing ""The Last Stand"" I can only imagine that they rifled through the comic books and every time they saw something they liked they said, ""We've gotta have that."" In the end, they decided to expound most upon 'The Cure' storyline and use their filmmaker's license to alter the course of events in the Marvel timeline.The Cure is an antibody produced by a young mutant (Cameron Bright) that suppresses the mutant gene and ""cures"" its ""victims"" of their powers. Magneto (Ian McKellen), fresh off unearthing the truth about Christ in ""The Da Vinci Code,"" staunchly opposes it and will go to great lengths to see it destroyed. Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the Martin Luther King Jr. of mutant activists, and his X-Men, led by Storm (Halle Berry) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), do not support the Cure, but support Magneto's means of fighting it even less. This sets the stage for an all out war between mutants, their brothers, and the limits of computer graphics that hinges on the resurrection of Jean Grey as Phoenix (Famke Janssen), a being of limitless power that breathes fire and fury.What sets the ""X-Men"" movies apart from so many other big budget, special effects laden extravaganzas are the universal themes that almost anyone watching them can relate to. They are of particular interest to gay teens struggling with who they are, and who society tells them they should be. Sadly, ""The Last Stand"" trades in much of its substance for spectacle.""The Last Stand"" feels like a turkey bursting at the seams with stuffing. Trouble is, there's too much stuffing and not enough turkey. It seems content to simply throw mutant after mutant at us just to show off some neat powers. Consider a scene where Wolverine fights a mutant who can grow back any appendage he loses. How do you beat that? Kick him below the belt of course (""Try growing those back"" is one of the films many throwaway lines). I can, however, recommend the film on the basis of its incredible visual effects. One scene in particular, involving Magneto and the Golden Gate Bridge, is worth the price of admission alone.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Nay-sayers . . . . READ THIS!!!!!,"Many people are upset by the actions taken in this film and I am here to adhere logic to the films decisions -- 1.) Pheonix doesn't have flames and power isn't as great as in comics - first of all the Phoenix saga is very complex in the comic, Bryan Singer really pushed the screenwriter into a corner by ending the second movie with jean being resurrected as the Phoenix. The movie smartly chooses to disregard the complex cosmic explanation and just explains it as a splintering of the mind, cause her power was to great for her to control. For a telepath to suddenly be engulfed in flames would not make sense to the audience and therefore be seen as stupid. 2.) The small parts of mutants and other x-men lore related moments . . i.e. The Danger Room. I felt Brett Ratner wanted the trilogy to end on a high note, giving fans all the things they had been begging for and had been denied. Although the mutants were use sparingly, all of them has some part to play in the plot and subsequently move the story along, it would have been great to see more of them but they were needed in the story and just seeing them on screen was enough to make this X-men Fan happy. The Danger Room sequence with the sentinel was put in there entirely for fan service, Bryan Singer chose to deny this both times to fans dismay . . . at least Brett Ratner didn't. And for those of just wanting to know, check out the Trivia section on the movie page to know that, initially they were going to have Gambit in the film. 3.) The multitude of deaths . . . most were due to disgruntled actors who did not want to continue any franchise installments. 4.) Why couldn't Pheonix blast Wolverine like a rag-doll like she did in the underground X-men lair? I think she was struggling with her consciousness, therefore not at full power, though a few close up face shots to prove this would have been nice. 5.) Pheonix isn't as strong as she is in the comic . . apparently the people who side with this argument had no problem over storm being as weak as she was in the first and second movie, which she thankful is closer to her actually strength in the third film. Most other disagreements have an explanation and are not that important to begin with.Now for the disagreements . . . In the final sequence magneto was a bit brain-dead, although this didn't ruin the film for me like others it was kinda stupid. 1.) Why did he move the entire Golden Gate Bridge? That just allowed for human soldier to come and gang up on him from both sides, in a battle that is not a smart move. 2.) Why didn't he just throw bits of the bridge at the army instead of sending mutants in to die? It would have been easily fixed to show Pheonix struggling with her Jean Gray consciousness over seeing her x-men comrades in gear and ready to fight and Magneto having to talk her down, therefore telling the mutants to charge as a diversion until he could get control of his weapon. 3.) Why did Pheonix just stand there? look to number 2 for what they should have done. 4.) Killing Cyclops, although I'm sure the actor wanted out, is a travesty. They could have easily showed him in an end sequence in the woods wrapped in some sort of telepathic something-or-another, something other than killing the leader of the X-men, although I hear Halle Berry demanded a bigger role for her to do the film.It may sound like I hated this film, but I loved it. I would rated it better than the first, but not as good as the second. The action is better than the first 2 combined, action sequences never seemed one of Bryan Singer's strong points as a director. The emotional weight of the film feels light and comic-booky which I like, but it never reaches the heart-wrenching moments of the 2nd film. This film feels more like fan service than the previous films, and although many characters were never elaborated on it does bother this viewer. Any comic book fan knew who they were and rejoiced over their appearance, and any causal viewer just liked watching their powers. Fun for the whole family.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Loved it!!,"This movie was great..!! I mean the effects the plot.. It all cam down to this in the end... Correctly named Last Stand. The fight between mutants and humans was told greatly!! Great Job!! I feel as though the movie was great from kids and adults alike. Having lines from the comics book and things of that nature left room for the comic books fans and also introduced the characters and such to someone who might not read them...While standing on line for the movie, even a mother of a young boy was excited to go to see this movie..Fnatastic! I would recommend this movie for all go-ers. We laughed we cried and everything in between. Get yourselves out there and try this movie on for size. You'll be glad they made their Last Stand!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not epic enough end,"The new plot about the cure is very interesting, and give a lot of discussions about if this is right or wrong.

wolverine is the cherry on top of this sweet ice cream of a movie,"What can i say about X-men 3 except that I have watched it about a thousand times and I'm still not sick and tired of it. Nor do I think I ever will be. I used to think Jean Grey was one of the worst X-men characters but when she comes out as the Phoenix, I not only had more respect for her but she scared the snot out of me when she killed Scott and the Professor. Poor Mystique. She had to go and get in the way of ""the cure"" and Magneto. She shouldn't have done it! But when I thought about it, if she did get in the way, then Magneto's powers would have been taken away early-on and there would not have been any point to the fight at the end. Oh yes, the fight. It was a great battle, and it just happens to be the part in the move where Bobby (the ice-man) fights the other guy ( i really can remember his name) who shoots out fire and at first it seems like the ""fire guy"" is going to burn Bobby to the ground and says, ""maybe you should go back to school"" and then Bobby turns into a giant ice sculpture, puts out the fire, head-buts the fire guy and says, "" You should have never left."" Best moment ever in my opinion. Anyway, to put it simply X-men is a great movie and if you have seen the end with Magneto and the end after the credits, you'll agree with me that there has to be a fourth one.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great film, but a strange sense of disappointment.","***MAJOR SPOILERS***I was expecting this film to be one of those films where at the end you sit back and go ""wow""... But X-men 3: The last stand left me leaving the cinema quietly with an overwhelming sense of disappointment and confusion. Several questions came to mind, and even more answers.1. A lot of attention has been brought to the fact that this IS the LAST 'X-men' film in the TRILOGY. But at the end of the film we see Magneto playing chess by himself, he clearly makes a metal chess piece move (although only slightly). And I'm left asking myself ""What is the point in the whole film if the ""bad guy"" still has his mutant powers at the end?"" And especially if its the end of a series of films. Where would we be at the end of star wars if Darth Vader were still alive! It clearly opens up the door for a FORTH film in the TRILOGY. Doesn't quite work does it?The only response I had to this question is that I know there is a film being made just based around Wolverine, and the only way it can make any sense is if Magneto is the enemy in that film. Although it's obvious who would win that battle.2. We are introduced to a new mutant in this third film, ""Angel"" (Ben Foster) is quite an elaborate character, and is quite a nice addition to the original X-men we are used to. But there is no detail into his origin, his life, and where he goes with it. At the start of the film we see him as a young boy destroying his wings. We see him almost being given the ""cure"" and escaping. And we see him saving his fathers life and flying off into the sun set... that's it, he doesn't say much, he doesn't do much, and he doesn't really interact with the other mutants (this could be deliberate by the director, maybe to emphasise how much of an outcast he is) but what's stranger? Having beautiful white wings... Or having spikes come out of your whole body? I don't see why he is such an outcast, and why nothing much is done with his character.3. The death of Scott Summers(James Marsden), or better known as Cyclops comes quickly and pointlessly; he storms off out of the school to search for the voices in his head. Next thing we know, he's dead, his glasses floating around the shore of the lake created at the end of the second film. Well...Make of it what you will, but I thought in all honesty it was kind of crap. I love to see one of the main characters die as much as the next fan, and I wasn't surprised it was Cyclops, but it was so sudden and with no investigation that the audience don't care, they want to know what Magneto is up to.4. Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) Magnetos main henchman (if that's the correct term) is turned into a human by a guard during her rescue scene, and Magneto leaves her naked in a smashed up coach in the middle of know where... Well apart from my girlfriend yelling ""bastard"" out load in the cinema at Magneto, nothing much happens with this either. We see her later in the film giving details of the where about of Magnetos mutant army ""hell hath no fury like a woman scorned"" indeed, but lets at least see her walking down the street and trying to turn into someone and everyone just looking at her like ""What's she doing?"" We don't get to see the effect of becoming human on the mutants that receive treatment.Other then those main complaints I did enjoy this film, my favourite part was defiantly when the army thought they where surrounding Magnetos mutant army, only to find it was just Multiple Man (Eric Dane) multiplied out into about 100 guys. Very clever. And I knew Wolverine would say some sad cheesy line during a fight scene, thank god it was a classy one! ""Grow those back"" Very cool. I know I complained about the whole Magneto moving the chess piece at the end, but when it moved it did give me Goosebumps, he is one of my favourite characters and I would love very much to see a come back.If your one of those people that like to watch a film with no questions left unanswered at the end, then this film IS NOT for you. However if you love a good old action film (especially a marvel one) with a great ending which leaves you bouncing of the walls asking the question ""Has he still got his powers!? Has he still got his powers!? Has he still got his powers!?"" then this film is defiantly for you.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Pretty good, but not as good as the first two","When I wrote my review for X2, I commented on how deftly it handled a huge cast of characters. Unfortunately, this is not the case with the sequel. Perhaps a lot of the problem is that it is nearly half an hour shorter. Angel is merely as a plot device. Colossus doesn't seem to even be integral to the story. Even Beast doesn't quite get his due. Kitty gets lots of screen time, but relatively little character development. The bad guys fare worse. Try to name two personality traits of any of Magneto's new goons. I can't do it.The previously established characters don't fare a lot better. Storm gets more screen time, but none of it particularly interesting. There are some bits with other characters, but the main cast is pared down to Professor X, Jean, Wolverine and Magneto, all fine characters, but a drastic reduction from the previous movies.The lack of characterization is noticeable compared to previous movies, though it more lessens the effect than wrecking it. All other aspects of the movie are quite strong, luckily. The effects, while perhaps taking too much of the focus, are top notch and the plot, about a company trying to market a cure for mutants and the political repercussions is quite interesting.I could have done with more character, more running time and less or better set pieces, but it's fairly good and I still look forward to any future output from the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Xcellent,"This movie. Was. Amazing.It had every quality to it.I'm pretty sure i laughed, i cried, and my eyes were plastered to that screen until the very last second of the movie.The special effects were amazing!The acting was incredible.The story was accurate enough for me.(people should realize if every detail was put into the movie the movie would be 5 hours long!)Ratner did a truly remarkable job showing aspects of a confused, troubled, bitter Jean/Phoenix. I've always been a huge fan of the Xmen series, and this movie is not a disappointment in the least. i can proudly say that with each scene i was left awed and moved.Once in a while u find the occasional person who does not like the movie, which is fine. In the theater i was in, i heard absolutely nothing but good comments regarding X3. Those occasional ""haters"" are the ones who come on here and trash the movie.

Should have waited for Brian Singer...,"Imagine it like this. You leave your home in the hands of a friend while you're away on holiday. You come back, the kitchen has burnt down, the pets are dead and what used to be upstairs is now a makeshift Gazebo in your front lawn.Ratner did not have the investment of Singer or the fans in this film and he did not treat it with the respect it deserved.He dropped an immensely well acted and favoured character from the series.He took Joss Whedon's premise and did it himself, never a good start - Alien Resurrection anyone?The plot is mangled and nonsensical.He then took liberties and leaps with the characters he had no right to. So drastic that it is now almost impossible for anyone to reassemble the pre-X3 franchise in any sensible way.He didn't understand the relationships between the characters and didn't try to. These are not the characters that we left in X2. The effects are cool, there are some neat moments but there is none of the emotional resonance or connection with the characters the other films had. He sacrificed what could have been great for the sake of a poorly done ""shock"" moment and some cool effects that will age quickly.Watch, if only to see and learn why sometimes it is best to wait for a genius than hire a stand in.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Don't understand some of the reviews,"I'm a 51-year-old-Mom who has never read an X-Men comic book. Knowing that I liked the Rings trilogy, Spiderman, etc., my daughter suggested the X-Men series. I loved the first two, so much so that I saw The Last Stand on opening day. In a nutshell - I LOVED IT. I'm sure that if I was a comic book geek (sorry, a comic book die-hard), I would find plenty to criticize. I've read some of their negative comments and must admit that I watched the first and second installments this weekend to gain some insight into their discontent. While these are awesome movies that do take plenty of time to develop the characters and the plot lines, I had no problem being able to get up from time to time to take a break to attend to nature, etc. (just as I did in the movie theater when I first saw them). However, when it comes down to hold onto your seat, non-stop action, there is no comparison between the first two and #3. OK, as a former post so pointedly points out - when they are on the bridge, it is daytime and then several scenes later it appears to switch to nighttime - silly me, I thought it had to do with the power of darkness! Guess that's what happens when you just enjoy the movies for what they are - a lot of fun. I'll be going back to the theater soon to watch #3 again.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Quick question???,"As a child I watched the X-Men cartoons, and I was just wondering what is going on in these X-Men movies? I'm pretty sure that the cartoons were accurate with the comics, but I have seen the second and now the Last Stand and I'm not really sure where these story lines are coming from? Are these in comics? I've visited the Marvel website and when reading the character bios nowhere does it describe any of those events. Did I just miss something?

X-Men The Last Stand,"X-Men ""The Last Stnd""............ I feel that as a huge Fan of not only the comic but the TV Series it was a let me down. The movie plot is that they have found a ""cure"" to remove the mutant genie cells from mutants, by use Leech (Cameron Bright) cells on mutants. Many new characters are introduced in the movie, Dr. Hank McCoy/Beast (Kelsey Grammar) which played an exciting and excellent roll, Cain Marko/Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) another great add on to the cast, but not up to par, Warren Worthington III/Angel (Ben Foster) which i felt play to small of a role, as did Peter Rasputin/Colossus (Daniel Cudmore). As i was watching the movie i felt that the story line was altered to much.. I found many ""facts"" in the movie that were no where near the comics of TV series, making it seem nothing like the traditional X-Men. And out of the 3 movie's this was not only the shortest but it felt like the were trying to make a dead line and rushed threw the movie...With the mount of add on's and the potential to make an amazing movie that could of been longer, it just left your unsatisfied. If you watch the credits many so called role were played but not really introduced (Jubilee, Rogue's Mother, Omega Red, ext..) all those which could of made the much more exciting...Final Thought on the movie it's a must see, over all it was a fun movie with a lot of action, twist's, and new event that will leave you asking for more, but it will leave real fans upset that they are saying this is the Final Movie to the saga, and to many thing were left undone, as what ever happened to Gambit, Morph, hopefully this is not the ""Last Stand""!..

Weak story,"As is the case with many a Hollywood ""blockbuster"" this movie is remarkably weak on story. I am an X-Men fan....I have a complete run of the comics, but this movie failed to capture any of the drama of the Dark Phoenix that was so well done in the comics. The story was just weak. Without a good story, movies are boring. And I found this movie to be just that....dull and uninteresting. On the bright side, Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellen are both good and they make the movie at least rate above a 5. The effects were also impressive....but, effects can only serve a plot, and this plot was just too anemic to be saved by good acting and/or special effects.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men The Last Stand Review,"After two satisfying X-Men films, it only seemed logical at the time that a third film should round off the series and provide a big-scale conclusion to the fight between mankind and mutant-kind.If nothing else, The Last Stand has plenty of action to satisfy; the fights occur pretty frequently, and seem much more hard-hitting than before. It has always been great to watch Magneto take out an armored convoy with impunity, before gathering his army and taking over Alcatraz. The final battle is a fun free-for-all with so many mutant powers being thrown around that it's crazy. A bunch of new mutants - Beast, The Juggernaut, the Phoenix - are welcome additions to the lore of the film series.Unfortunately, the film has not sat well with many viewers. Part of the issue is that the film doesn't take itself as seriously as its predecessors, and there are moments throughout where it tries to be funny but mostly isn't. What really ticks viewers off will be the storytelling decisions; many of the characters go into undesirable directions (including death). One's enjoyment of the film may also hinge on how seriously you can accept that mutation can be cured so easily. There are probably some plot holes to be found as well.A lot of these issues have never bothered me personally (save for what happens to certain characters). For casual popcorn entertainment, the film is enjoyable in a laid-back manner. Its story flows well enough, and provides at least some closure to the series (at least at the time it was made).The film looks nice and slick, with quality photography and editing. Actors continue to do their job admirably, with Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, and everybody else pulling their weight well. Even Halle Berry seems to step up her performance a little. Writing is okay. This production boasts good-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects are often good, but some are weak. Music is alright.X-Men: The Last Stand is an enjoyable onslaught of mutant brawling, but many viewers won't like what they've done to the characters and plot. It is a thrilling enough climax to the original three movies, but it's not quite as powerful of a catharsis as it thinks it is. It is often considered one of the worst comic-book movies ever, alongside with Spiderman 3. I personally don't think it's that bad, but it certainly has its share of weaknesses, and isn't quite as sublime as the first two movies.Recommended only as a rental.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Marginal | Film: Pretty Good)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Ratner ruins another franchise,"***NO CRUCIAL Spoilers HERE, BUT THERE ARE SOME*** Why do these major motion picture companies continue to let Brett Ratner direct their films? First Hannibal Lecter and now X-men. Who cares if he has wanted to direct a comic book/X-men film for years? I just hope they won't let him do it again! Why you ask? because all of his films are incomplete thoughts and ideas, or scenes that are so literal you can predict exactly what is going to happen next or throughout the rest of the film. The best example of this is how characters appear in his films just to be there but serve no real purpose. For example, why is Rogue in this film? What is the point? To tell us that everyone's life is their own and they should be able to make their own choices? Excuse me, but even though the plot is paper thin, it gives the audience enough knowledge of this conflict without her even needing to appear in the film. Also, the conflict is never fully established between her or Bobby, or even Kitty for that matter. Is that because she is angry about her powers and inability to get close to others? Maybe, but even if it is, who cares? We get it! The other problem with his films are that the characters appearing will usually only serve one specific purpose to the story, such as in Red Dragon, where we get to see Mary Louise Parker a whole 3 times before the climax of the film, and one of these times she is learning to fire a gun...can you guess what purpose her character served in the end? Same thing in this film: we get new mutants to link the story together because the director and writers couldn't figure how else to do it. Example: Isn't it just a LITTLE too convenient to introduce a character that can sense another mutant's powers and strengths? I mean, really, how many times do we have to hear a location call-out to Magneto because the writers needed to link this mess together (i.e.- ""she's on the far side of the building"", ""she's at her house"", ""she's in a heavily guarded trailer going god knows where!"").The scenes in his films follow no story line and might as well be pasted together in any given order. Example: one of Magneto's cohorts is turned human just to have Magneto turn his back on them because they are no longer a mutant. Is the point of this scene to establish that he is a really bad guy? Or is it a set-up for this character to betray Magneto later, just to have the betrayal result in nothing? Does this betrayal have anything to do with propelling the plot of this film forward? No. Its pointless! The rest of the film is Ratner trying to see how many new mutant powers he can show off without any real purpose except for us to watch the special effects in action. Shock waves, ramming through walls, moving at the speed of light, doppelgangers to confuse us (like we didn't see that one coming)...the list goes on. The effects are really cool and seamless, but who cares? After all this the film goes to the government trying to track down the rebel mutants in a remote forest, resulting in nothing being gained by this betrayal of Magneto's former accomplice, followed by the story moving straight into the climax...why? I assume the only reasoning for this is to once again see the ""new mutants"" in this franchise using their powers.For all of the special effects and the gruesome happenings in this film, it is pretty neat to watch, but after having left the theater, it becomes less impressive almost immediately. Tons of the main characters die, people switch sides, then die, battles ensue 'just because', characters are introduced and then killed for no purpose, and the whole time the camera does nothing to capture any real emotion in which the first two films had expressed so wonderfully.ALSO, all of the fight sequences you will have seen before, so don't expect anything new. You will see fight sequences with no real purpose, and you will see characters go ""places"" and get into fights with no reason, and not even to propel the plot in any way. For example: one of the characters gets into a really bad fight after having gone out to look for another and then comes back and says ""She's with Magneto"". Of course she is with Magneto....he took her 20 minutes ago when you were with her!!!! More violence and special effects do not compensate for a bad story and a bad director who cannot keep anything together enough for anyone who reads books to tear out the pages and put back in any given order.Wait for DVD if you already have not seen it.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Beautiful finale with only one major flaw.,"Nothing will top the miracle which was Spider Man 2, but this third entry in the X-Men series comes darn close! I agree with another's review I read who said that aside from many parts of this movie being ""rushed,"" it was superbly written, acted, and directed and the emotions are stronger than ever! In a time period where movies are ""at their worst"" it's nice to see something like this come along. This movie deserves to re-spark the waning grosses that have been going on all this year.It's hard for me to give a true review without giving something away or repeating what others have said, but I'll try.The action and dialog come at you non-stop, I had to use the bathroom and couldn't find a lull where I didn't feel I'd miss something important. And I doubt that you will. This movie comes at you full-speed, there's no time to stop and take anything in or ponder certain aspects of the movie before it moves on to something else equally interesting.The plot (although excellent) is also more simple than the first two: some rich guy's son (Angel) is a mutant, so he dedicates some of his resources to develop a ""cure"" for mutants. They develop the cure by producing mutant-blocking antibodies from the blood of a young mutant boy (Leech) who has the inadvertent power of nullifying the mutant powers of any mutant who comes near him (within about 6 feet). Magneto takes this as a personal affront to mutants everywhere, even though they swear that the ""cure"" will only be given to mutants who volunteer for it. However, when this cure is used in self-defense, Magneto seizes this as an opportunity to claim that humans are on the offensive and raises a huge army of angry mutants against the pharmaceutical company that created it.The sub-plot involves the return of Jean Grey. Cyclops discovers her at the lake where she was assumed dead. Several ominous secrets about her are revealed, and her loyalties are tested. But...does she choose sides, or can anyone truly control what she has become, and has secretly always been......? The only other ""problem"" is, like the other 2, it is esoteric, appealing only to fans of the genre or sci-fi fans.However, as compressed as it is, it is DEFINITELY worth your time and money to see this in the theater if you are a fan of the first 2, and if you're not, it's a must rent.I hope I've been helpful, this is a must-see for X-Men fans everywhere, and hopefully we'll get to see a director's cut in the DVD.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Xmen 3.... Awesome action but character development?,"This is a great movie. Not because it's a good movie movie but because of the insane amount of action.I'm not going to lie, the action makes this film. Unlike the previous two movie, people ACTUALLY get killed and they get killed in extravangant ways. The action was good and it would've been good with the previous director. This movie was VERY creative.But... The characters. Sure, the X-storyline is VERY confusing but the plot can be summed up. Just don't forget to add character development. There were many scenes where characters started to have issues and then later in the movie after the main crisis, all those character issues, AREN'T RESOLVED. NONE ARE. ESPECIALLY the one with Bobby Drake/Iceman.The last 10 minutes seemed rushed. Like they ran out of money and just wrapped it up. Thus because of the lack of an ending, the X-men Trilogy MUST now become a multi-movie franchise that I could've done without.Kudos Mr.New Director. Just don't forget to read the comic books next time and watch a chick flick or two to find out WHAT drama is. Thankyou goodnight and goodluck.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X3 is all Flaws & Claws,"I saw the movie tonight and I liked it for the most part.It had some flaws, in the treatment of the X-Men. Cyclops, Angel, Rogue, and even the great Mystique is underused.Cyclops is the first to feel it, shooting was done on Superman Returns so the actor was free too be in the movie more. A shame as the movie's end would have had more an impact if it was Cyclops in Logan's place.This was Berry's fault, she wanted to lead the X-men to get more to do for Storm. Yet storms still does very little.The new X-men are great, Kitty was fantastic, Angel was underused and had no real reason to be in the film. The best of the new blood was Beast.The action was amazing if a bit rushed, the FX where great too. For all the flaws the film was great to sit back and chill watching the action rock on.All the posters where saying take a side saying that the Brotherhood where not the bad guys... I have to say I started rooting for them after Jean returned.Over all I'd give it a 8 out of 10 for the last half hour alone!Enjoy the show!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Enjoyable But.....,"X-Men: The Last Stand is the weakest of the original trilogy. All the heart and character development from the previous movies is gone, and it's replaces with more effects, explosions and action scenes. But it's still an entertaining flick, it just won't be the X-Men movie I rush to watch again.Plot In A Paragraph: It has been several months since the events at the end of the second movie, Scott Summers (Cyclops) is having a hard time and is grieving about the loss of Jean Grey. Meanwhile, the rift between humans and mutants has finally reached the boiling point. Humans have discovered what causes humans to mutate and have found a cure for the mutation. When news about the cure comes to Magneto, he decides to organise an army of mutants and wage war against the humans.If I thought James Marsden's Cyclops was under used in the last movie, it's worse here. Halle Berry is given more to do than in the previous movie and I'm sure it's more in relation to her having an Oscar (Monsters Ball) than a Razzie (Catwoman). Rebecca Romijn isn't given as much to do here as one would hope likewise Patrick Stewarts screen time is all too brief.It's nice to see Bill Duke (Predator/Commando) in a movie again, but Ian McKellen over acts an awful amount and (I hate to say) he is hamming it up to almost pantomime villain level and Famke Jenssen is certainly no Sally Field when it comes to playing someone with multiple personalities. Kelsey Grammar is a welcome addition to the franchise, as is Ellen Page. Sadly the same can't be said for Vinnie Jones.It's Hugh Jackman who is the movies saving grace and along with (Grammer and Page) the main reason I made it all the way through!! The movie got better every time he is on the screen. He is fast becoming an actor I will give anything with his name in the cast a chance.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men 3,"Easily the most action packed than the previous films, but another swell improvement to the series. The full potential of these mutants is officially brought out as Magneto seeks his final revenge. With the incredible effects and battles, this one is quite a keeper from Marvel and is sure to knock your socks off. The intensity level may be a little much for an X-Men film, and the plot was rather self-explanatory throughout, though the plot itself still continued the flow of the overall story. From other such reviews of this film, I whole-heartily agree on having a thrill and a good time during this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good movie overall (unbiased review),"First off, if you're a hardcore comic book fan (not just familiar with the cartoons), where you know the bios of most, if not all characters inside and out, then you are going to be disappointed at the direction of this movie, otherwise, this is a really good movie.Yes, Brett Ratner is no Bryan Singer, where as Bryan appears to actually care about the history of characters, and attempt at his best to present their history, Brett directs more to a general audience, that is, an audience that is not mostly composed of current/veteran comic book readers. So he's made this movie enjoyable for everyone.Am I disappointed at certain character developments (or lack there of)? Yes. Would I have rather seen this movie separated into two separate movies? Yes. But that does NOT make me regret purchasing the tickets for this movie.Also, I notice from several comments prior to this, an ongoing joke of how this movie's compared to Brett's previous Rush Hour titles. Yes, that does sound funny and disappointing (or just disappointing), but the fact is the Rush Hour titles were also good movies, NOT great, but good enough succeed as an entertaining film.That's my point here, that this movie is NOT A FAILURE. A movie that sucks is a movie that fails to entertain from any aspect. This movie had humor, plenty of action, plenty of eye-candy, and a ""decent"" storyline.This shouldn't be that big of a shock, since the ratio of typical movie watchers to comic book fans is like 10 to 2. Who do you think the studios are going to aim at?If you want a clear example of comic book movies that suck, watch Daredevil (starring Ben Afflek) and Hulk (starring Eric Bana) and come back to this movie. And if those two ""failures"" haven't changed your mind, then watch Captian America (starring Matt Salinger) and have a clear understanding of what a movie that ""sucks"" really is, and if you STILL have yet to tap out, then watch Nick Fury: Agent of Shield (David Hasselhoff) and flat out apologize to Brett even trying to degrade this current blockbuster.Bottom line, don't expect this movie to have striking similarities to any comic books related to the characters, otherwise (especially if you're not comic book savvy), enjoy the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Strategic Review **SPOILERS**,"I saw the midnight showing of this film and I thought it was without a doubt, incredible. Sure, some of the dialog was WAY too scripted--but it wouldn't be a comic book movie other wise. However, the special effects? The PLOT? It was utterly BRILLIANT.Magneto not only lives up to his stoic evil supremeness from the first two films, but he becomes the utmost chilling villain as he realizes what potential of power he could wield by having a power house like Jean Grey on his side. Xavier as per usual will stick up for humanity and his codes on morals and ethics, just as he expects his precious X-Men to do in turn.The true villain here is Jean Grey or most known as the Dark Phoenix--a smart little plot change for movie rights to work by making Jean Grey have a split personality disorder. (It's from this stand point we also get a taste of Professor Xavier's alterer motives as he is involved in her training because he knows she could used to do great things...) So brilliantly put and so brilliantly played--Jean Grey becomes the true evil entity in this masterpiece.Though Magneto is ever powerful and makes that statement by relocating the Golden Gate Bridge, he is no match for Dark Phoenix. Neither is Xavier. As a viewer, it was vastly incredible to see the Professor himself become dissembled molecule by molecule all due to Jean Grey. That scene was mind boggling--if not a bit disturbing. Once she takes out the very person who made her what she is today? Clearly you have no idea what side of the fence she's on.It seemed fitting that Wolverine would be the only one to put an end to all the madness... Magneto out of commission due to a fatal dart stab filled with Leech's nulling DNA... Most of the X-Men out of commission... Cyclops dead, Rogue trying to be cured. However because Wolverine could regenerate and apparently held some sort of brief contact with that woman once known as Jean... It was poetic justice that he be the one the sink the blades in. (This is a special treat to any who has read Origin of Wolverine...)The scene in which Warren as a child is literally cutting and slicing his feathers off in order to remain normal was astounding and powerful. Indeed, something of a ""cure"" is found--the DNA of yet another mutant. DNA so potent it nulls out ANY power.There are many enemies here; Though I am inclined to think this... Who truly is the ""evolved"" of the species? The mutants? For being able to perform the feats they can? Or the humans? For learning how to harness the one thing and market it to stop the mutants in their tracks?Once again, a very well done flick. Best of the three--and clearly the darkest of the three. Make Marvel Mine.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good but empty,"I am a HUGE X-fan, and although I liked most of the movie, realistically, it was like a beautifully wrapped gift that ends up being just a box. The action was fantastic and while I am not a big ""character development"" person, a lot of things about the movie didn't make sense. I didn't understand the motivation behind Phoenix's character. It was a little more graphic in the sense that there was a ""gettin' it on"" scene where children will quickly be educated about sex and how you do it. Also, I don't like the use of the b-word in the movie. It was over the top in those two areas. I loved Beast as a character; Kelsey Grammar isn't the first person I would have picked, but after seeing him in action he is PERFECT. In my opinion, he stole the show. Storm's character was still a little weak, and the storyline seemed very tenuous and fragile. The action could not cover up the movie's flaws. It was okay, but I can definitely tell that Bryan Singer didn't direct it. Also, I know movies can be different from the myth, but I really didn't like the total disregard of the spirit of the original stories. The cartoon version of the Phoenix saga did far more justice than this movie did.That being said, it was worth the $7 admission if you're looking for something briefly gratifying, like candy. If you prefer movies that take the original myth/comic/book, etc into consideration, wait until it comes out on video.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Falls Right in the Middle,"After X2, I was really looking forward to the third installment of the X-Men saga. When the film came out, some were happy with what the third film had to offer, while others were angered to the point of ripping every X-Men comic book in their household. I on the other hand had mixed feelings on X-Men: The Last Stand, overall liking the film, but feeling that it could have been improved in some areas. The new director of the series, Brett Ratner, really tried new things and did something unlike Singer did, but I think Ratner's X-Men 3 falls flat in some spots and really doesn't live up to the previous two installments. It had things I liked and things I disliked, but overall, X-Men: The Last Stand is an average film that would turn a lot of X-fans off the series for quite sometime.Let's talk about the pros. Like the previous two films, X3 really digs in deep with the political matters and mutant protesting. The inclusion of Kelsey Grammar as Hank Mccoy/Beast really makes the mutants more heard in the face of the humans. The humans, as corrupt as they are portrayed in this film, view mutants as sick beings and form a cure to rid them of their mutant abilities. Both the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants oppose of the cure, and while the X-Men continue on their quest for mutant acceptance in society, Magneto's Brotherhood plans to overthrow the humans and take out the source of the cure, which in fact is a mutant named Leech. The tension between the good side and the bad side really shines in this film and you can feel the motivation of each character, especially Magneto, who recruits several hundred mutants into his league to stop the humans from trying to make mutants more like them. Another thing I like is that Professor X, despite all the crap he endures in this film, continues preaching his philosophy and optimistic point of view of each situation. Like he did with Captain Jean-Luc, Patrick Stewart really makes Professor X a kindly father like figure to many of the film's main characters.Also pleasant in the film is the overall themes of corruption and deception. The character of Jean Grey/Phoenix is manipulated by Magneto as she finds that she can no longer find her place among the X-Men. The character of Warren Worthington/Angel is forced to endure the cure against his will, for his father is the one who developed the cure from Leech. As he is almost injected with it, he uses his massive feathered wings to fly out a window and he later joins the X-Men. Another theme of the film is choosing fate. The character of Rogue has to decide whether to take the cure or not, for she wants to be able to touch people and not inflict any pain upon them. And kudos to the filmmakers for adding the Days of Future Past simulation in the Danger Room at the film's opening. It was great to see the mutants' powers put to good use and for Wolverine and Colossus to perform the ""Fastball Special"", Wolverine beheading a Sentinel in the process.Now let's get to the cons. Too many characters are killed off or pushed aside in this film and many characters are not as developed as they should be. I could go on and on about how Cyclops was killed off about 20 minutes into the film, but it has been said dozens of times already and I'm not even going to bother talking about it now. I will say that people hate this because the promotional images for X3 showed Cyclops in full costume walking alongside the other X-Men as if he was a major part of the film and that James Marsden left X3 to play a meager role in Bryan Singer's Superman Returns. Other characters to get the shaft are Rebecca Romijn's Mystique and even Patrick Stewart's Professor X bites the dust almost an hour into the film. It's not that these characters' demises aren't dramatic, for deaths of major characters can work if done right, but each of these characters fall in such fast paced, anti-climatic ways. It doesn't really add that much tension.The wooden acting that was present in the previous two films is also amplified in the third film. Ben Foster's Angel could have been acted out a little better and his character could have been developed a bit more. Anna Paquin's Rogue was a little flat, but then again, her acting was also flat in the previous films. Even Ellen Page (pre-Juno) as Kitty Pryde could have used a little more depth, although it's good to see Kitty Pryde actually play a major part in an X-Men film rather than just have a brief cameo like in the previous films. So X-Men: The Last Stand falls right in the ""okay"" category. It's good for what it is, but not near as good as what X-Men and X2 had to offer. Take it for what it is, or just plain out avoid it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Decent finish to a fine series.,"I watched the final movie of the X-men saga with dire expectations.By reading the other comments i could feel all of them are little too harsh towards the new director.Of course he isn't the bryan who made the first two installments.But to completely criticize it is also lame.I feel ratner concentrated too much on the fights and showing off for different x men abilities.I liked to stress one of the points that a user comment said.The movie lacked the drama,characterization,and mainly events don't completely dot well enough.There should have been more emotional drama in the middle.Everything aside,was the movie entertaining?...Yes,that's why i can't rate it low.In spite of some disappointments the movie does keep us engaged.There is no doubt Bryan would have delivered a better finale.Still don't write off last stand.It's a pretty decent attempt",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A studio money-spinner with bite,"A departed fanboy director. A widely reported rush production. And Brett Ratner as replacement director. Things weren't looking good for the third filmic outing of our X-Heroes. Cynics crossed their arms in haughty resignation, while comic geeks vented their outrage in a fittingly Phoenix-inspired display. And yet despite the odds here it is, tipped as the last stand, and the fears of those expecting the worst were perhaps unjustified.Promising more emotional grounding in his instalment, director Ratner managed to pacify the blood-braying fanboys (and girls) still reeling from the sudden departure of fan favourite Singer. A snazzy trailer helped, showcasing some saliva-inducing imagery, and confirming that Ratner was faithfully sticking to Singer's staunch visual style. The question remained, however; could he follow through and create an X adventure worthy of its highly acclaimed predecessors? The surprising answer is yes. And no. Well, sort of. X-Men: The Last Stand is a leaner, more streamlined entry excelling in slick sets, breathtaking action, and top-notch special effects. This is a summer blockbuster to the core, and damn proud of it.Ratner's presence behind the camera is unmistakable, and it is undeniably his crowd-pleasing instincts that steer X3 through the pitfalls of studio money-spinning agendas that surrounded the production. Unleashed on his audience is an infectious enthusiasm for visual spectacle that generates satisfyingly outrageous cinematic results. Not only are we are afforded a spectacular face-off at the Grey residence, but also the stunning sight of the Golden Gate Bridge being magnificently relocated, and a striking finale in which the world is literally turned upside down in an emotional confrontation.This, however, is a film creaking with franchise baggage. The events of not one, but two previous X films bear down on Ratner's film like the fists of Colossus, giving it a somewhat schizophrenic ambiance. The thrill-seeking director clearly struggles to compose X3 as both a sequel and a stand-alone adventure. As a consequence, few actors are given much to work with save the key players, who do what they can with a script that appears in a bit of a hurry. Famke Janssen stands heads above the rest: nothing short of brilliant as the returned Jean Grey (or Dark Phoenix), she portrays just the right amount of inner turmoil, vulnerability and downright creepy-ness to really hit the right notes. Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart are again the glue that holds everything together, both skilfully communicating the subtle nuances of their characters' complex relationship. Others, like Kelsey Grammar's Beast, and even James Marsden's Cyclops come across as something of an after thought. There's simply too much cast spread much too thinly.The sacrifices extend throughout the rest of the film, too. Those little moments that imbued the other X films with heart and gravity are glaringly absent here; characters rush through expositional speeches, barely pausing for breath before the next explosive encounter. So while the pow-pow-pow approach ensures X3 a vigorous pace that effectively gathers momentum, its resultant whirlwind can tend to sweep over the rest of the film to its own detriment.And when the final credits roll, just how has Ratner done with his last minute leap into the world of X? It's difficult to judge how much tighter his X3 could have been if more time and creative control had been offered to him. The studio leash tightens noticeably as the running time accumulates: the three plot lines each struggle for exposure but none reach an entirely satisfactory conclusion. In the end, Ratner must be commended for crafting a film in a decidedly dubious climate, a film that is not only watchable, but entertaining too. X3 has its shortcomings, but there's more than enough bang for your buck. And of course things are left nicely open for another sequel. Now, where to find a fanboy director to fill those Singer-sized shoes?",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A wonderful ending to an amazing franchise,"X-Men: The Last Stand was the final installment in the X-Men trilogy. The X-Men return one final time in this brilliant ending to one of the most prolific trilogy's of the 2000's.A cure for mutations has been found by humans, and this sends the mutant community into spiral; a third want the 'cure', a third find the cure wrong, and the remaining third - namely, the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants - see the cure as the start of a war.Not many people like this movie, however, I throughly enjoyed it. I thought it was a good wrap to the movies, all loose ends were tied up and new story lines were made. New stars were shown (i.e. Ellen Page as Kitty Pryde) and yet more new mutants were introduced to the movie-verse. A wonderful ending to an amazing franchise, a 7/10 and a place on my must watch franchises list.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men: The Last Strand: (Of Stan Lee's Self Respect?),"As an Australian i am perhaps somewhat biased. As such, i am the first to acknowledge that perhaps the only substantive, redeeming factor of this movie is Hugh Jackman (aka Wolverine). His hair still sucks, he can't really smoke a cigar and his super hero skills ( 'adamantium' and healing himself) are quite unimpressive. However he can act - just, in this movie.Compared to the rest of the cast, however, Hugh Jackman's acting skills are acceptable.The problem with this movie is that it is like a bad sequel - a deformed and retarded creation that should never have seen the light of day. Halle Berry is clearly disinterested in what she is doing and Patrick Stewart is as wooden as ever: (Yes, he is bald, and speaks with a slightly gentrified English accent but that never made him a good actor in Star Trek Generation - and it does not here either!). The script of this movie is awful. That much is beyond contention.However, as always, one would expect an action movie, particularly one involving super heroes to rack up some brownie points in the special effects department. This movie does not. The 'special effects' are singularly unimpresive. The explosions look like something you would see on a tour of Universal Studios and the CGI is basic at best. The effects displayed in the 'explosive fianl battle' of the movie barely rate a comment. As was demonstrated by Apocalypse Now - the best way to depict the destruction of buildings for the purposes of a movie is to drop a few napalm cannisters on a village while the camera is running. Decent special effects are certainly lacking in this movie.I enjoyed X-Men and thought X2 was impressive and interesting. I am a comic collector and enjoy watching special effects on screen. I also enjoy watching decent acting. However, I found little to enjoy in this movie. Those that should be major characters are relegated to bit parts, while the acting skills of accomplished actors such as Ian McKellan are not utilised at all.Script: predictable Special effects: underwhelmingWhile i sat through this movie with the dignity not to complain excessively, upon exiting the theatre i wished i was man enough to demand a refund. Don't make the same mistake, see ""V for Vendetta"" instead and watch a movie with substance (and explosions, lycra and killing).",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"X men 3 ""The Last Fan Betrayal"" but I love X men","I've been a fan of X men since as long as I can remember.

X men 3 was a nightmare.Why, well If you've been reading stuff you'll notice that half are happy, half are not. The difference is that All are X men fans.

Good but really dumb,"There were just too many dumb inconsistencies in the movie to allow me to sit back and enjoy it for the comic book it was, There was an antidote for the mutant gene but there was a kid with the same powers.

I mean people with such enormous powers were getting zonked with adolescent tricks.

Flawed but fitting end to one of the best comic-to-big screen adaptations.,"I have just finished watching X-Men: The Last Stand and being a fan of the comics, and TV series since I was a kid I was naturally holding high expectations of this final chapter . The last 2 X-Men movies were great and this should of been the one to top it of. Basically this time the story revolves around some sort of cure that has been found for the mutants making them human again , yet again this does not go down well with mutant fundamentalist Magento in whose eyes history is repeating it-self takes it upon him-self and forms a group known as The Brotherhood (Brother hood of evil mutants in the comics). And once again it is up to good old Professer X and the gang to save the world and also deal with the return of Jean Grey who is not quite her-self. First of X-men waste's no time in going into the action straight away and we are shown by the action that this time they mean business. The SFX were great and there were even a few shockers along the way which kept me going , but however not only that but you get to see a few sides to the characters that you not normally see and it was good to show some development on the likes of Wolverine,Storm , even Rogue . The acting was great from the norm of Hugh Jackmamn , Halle Berry , Patrick Stuart, Ian Mckalen , but however I felt that the stand out performance was Kelsay Grammar who played Hank McCoy/Beast (they got him spot on correct, and even Vinnie Jones was fairly amusing as the Juggernaut . However this movie is not without its fair share of problems , although I felt that there was a lot more emotions in this movie compared to the other 2 I did feel that it was a little too rushed and thusly tried to cram a bit too much in 2 hours . I also felt some of the characters were a little over used i.e. Pyro , Clossalus . Another that also bugged me was the changing of the story line and any comic book fan would tell you that they would tell that and I was tempted to take a few marks of for that but I guess I am just a bit too much of a softy . On the whole The Last Stand has a few problems but if you can over look that trust me it will be worth it . A very fine but not perfect end to what has been one of the best comic-to-movie saga's and I am looking forward to solo Wolverine and Magento projects coming up.X-MEN : THE LAST STAND 9 OUT 10FOR NOW THIS IS THE SHADOWMAN WISHING YOU GOOD NIGHT AND GOOD LUCK.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

More Than Just Action,"The X-Men movies, and this one in particular, are about more than action and special effects -- although those are great -- but also provoke thought about real ethical issues.If you strongly dislike action movies, then no, you won't be a fan, but there's far more going on in this than just explosions and fist fights. These characters face some weighty decisions, about morality and their own lives.The special effects are stunning, the writing is good, the characters are well developed, the acting is solid. The costuming, in my opinion, had one flaw -- Hank McCoy, aka The Beast, could have used more fur on his face. As in the previous films, the X-costumes used in the movie are black leather, which look sleek on screen, although they very from the comic book costumes. But do we really want to see what yellow spandex looks like when it isn't pencilled and inked by graphic artists, but is actually worn by Hugh Jackman? Probably not.As for plot specific comments, I don't believe in spoilers. Do sit through the closing credits, however, you won't be sorry you did.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Noisy, trainwreck ending to the series....","The third and final installment in this iteration of the big screen X-Men is easily the most disappointing. It is a fair movie, but not up to snuff with the other 2 entries, and for easily identifiable reasons.First,direction. Bryan Singer is out, Brett Ratner is in. When Singer defected Marvel's X-Men to helm the DC Superman project, all fans of the series instantly got a bad feeling in their gut, and it can now be confirmed as justified. Ratner hit gold with the Rush Hour movies, but has also screwed up Red Dragon, After the Sunset, and Money Talks. But, Ratner didn't mess this movie up all on his own, he got himself some really bad writing to boot.Next, writing. David Hayter begged off after doing 1 and 2 with co-writer Zak Penn, but Penn is beginning to look more Garfunkle than Simon. Penn contributed to the scripts for Elektra and Fantastic Four, which alone should have disqualified him from ever making another superhero movie, but until he was separated from Hayter on an X-Men script, his lack of writing chops remained at least partly hidden.In Hayter's place, Ratner signed on Simon Kinberg, a British screenwriter who helped write xXx:State of the Union, and Mr. and Mrs. Smith. This choice reminds me of Marvel putting Mark Steven Johnson in charge of ruining Daredevil, Elektra, and soon Ghost Rider, based upon his fine work writing Jack Frost and Simon Birch? In this regard, Marvel (and Hollywood overall) shows it's liberal stripes; only in Washington DC and Hollywood do people who completely screw things up get wads of cash and more important projects to screw up.So, needless to say, X3 was doomed from the start, and it is a credit to the strong character foundation left by Singer that it did not completely suck.And finally, the end result on screen. X3:Last Stand is uneven, overly dark, and a bit schizophrenic. The momentum from X2 is all that initially propels the movie, and the constant shifting of the story and characters kills that pretty fast. And, apparently, Ratner has decided to use the Hernando Cortez method of film-making, burning his ships behind him to make sure no one can come and try to make an X4. As a matter of fact, the wanton reckless nature with which he treats this franchise bordered on startling. And I couldn't help but think as I watched that Ratner was simply firing for effect at times, using shock to hold his audience where Singer would have applied solid, old fashioned drama.Most of the established characters are misused, ignored, or just plain cast aside, and the unscripted omission of Nightcrawler is particularly distracting. New characters are jumbled in with little or no foreplay, the net effect being many of them serving as window dressing more than anything else. Vinny Jones' juggernaut is most notably squandered, and that Angel was even in this movie - offering an early story element, but otherwise gliding through - is the only thing leading me to believe that another sequel could rise out of the ashes of this one. Kellsey Grammar's Beast is interesting and true to the comic book, but borderline out of place with the choppy bits of story he gets. The core characters lack consistency in this story, so secondary characters like Beast, Collossus, Angel, etc, struggle to take root themselves. And Bobby Drake/Iceman's flirt affair with Kitty Pride was just plain run of the mill bad Hollywood writing, impeding his effort to be established as a main character here.It's always hard to judge how good/bad a sequel is on it's own merits, outside of the larger context of a serial, and this is especially true with a sequel like this one that is the culmination of a series I am so fond of. Thus, my harsh judgement is not solely a reflection of X3, but is in part resentment for Hollywood studio fatheads that gave X3 to Ratner, Penn, and Kinberg, throwing away the capital Singer had built up the past 6 years in this tossed together finale. I mean, how can us fans who pay our $10 to see a movie spot a disaster in the making like this writing/directing team a mile away, while studio executives whose multi-million dollar existences are funded by avoiding said disasters cluelessly blunder forth as they did? I mean, did someone flip a coin to select this team or something? Has anyone in Hollywood seen xXx:State of the Union? After the Sunset? Fantastic Four? Hello? If you were to leave a DVD of any of those three movies on a sidewalk in a town that has pooperscooper laws, you would be fined.X3 is perhaps less horrible that I make it sound - it certainly has it's moments - but calling it anything less than disappointing when placed along X1 and X2 would be misleading.2.5 stars",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
good,"I thought it was a bit fast-paced, but not to the point of confusion; the story was more or less about everything finally comin' to a head... which made the 'fast pace' seem somewhat sensible(being that it picked up with everything that had already been happening in the first two films.) I think it did a decent job in the fact that, with all things considered,it tried to give a sort of 'mundane' feel to the X-men world like the first two. I felt the acting was good, no worse than the first two either. There were also many surprises that came- even the things that I had heard were going to happen had me thinking 'WOW' when it finally happened. To me in general it seemed like the climax of the whole trilogy was the main focus in this one, all other things being shown in the first two; for example I don't really feel there was a HUGE lack of character development as some people seem to think. As for some cheezy one-liners and stuff like that, it wasn't any better or worse than the first two!! All-in-all, I like it.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Xmen 3 what the hell happened,"Let me start by saying that I am a big fan of the whole x-men story be it comics or movies. The previous two X-men films were great movies, the x-men world was translated brilliantly by Singer and his team. What I want to know is what the hell happened that made this movie so awful when the studio had two solid films like xmen 1 AND 2 to use as reference on how it should have been done. This movie seems to be an attempt to wipe any decent work that has been done by Bryan Singer and Tom De Santo on the previous tow movies.The Characters in this film had only a slight resemblance ""character wise"" to the previous 2 movies they don't seem to be invested in these parts as much as they used to there is no chemistry in this movie between the teams like there was in the first and second xmen movies. Wolverine didn't have any of his usual lone wolf characteristics that he always has (Thats what Wolverine is a loner who finds it difficult to work in a team he will always be this way thats why the audience like him a lose cannon willing to do whatever it takes).Storm only received a larger part in this movie because Halle Berry was playing her, the Oscar made sure of that. That said I'm not the biggest fan of Berry but she was probably one of the only characters i liked in this piece she showed she can take on a role that doesn't need her to show some skin for a change.Then there was the rest of the x-men who seemed to be just thrown in for the sake of having people to fill the holes left by cyclops,jean Grey and the much missed Nightcrawler (His opening scene in X2 made the film for me) I mean Colossus was only there to use for the two scenes were he hurls Wolverine around (a.k.a the fastball special)he barely has any screen time outside of these two scenes. Shadowcat was interesting in parts but was a weak substitute for rogue in the love interest stakes for Iceman I mean come on ! she looks 12 in this movie Rogue is practically a fully grown woman at this stage. Kelsey Grammar was all well and good as beast but he just never really looked comfortable in the blue fur suit. Why did Xavier become such an arrogant ass in this movie?. He is the symbol of tolerance and understanding in the X-men verse and in this movie we see him tell Wolverine that he never has to explain his actions to anyone least of all him.!!! way to go with the words of tolerance Chuck! good job.I can see why Brett Ratner was so worried about filling in for Singer the studio had already gone through three directors before they got to him the cinematography was poor and the editing choppy the whole look are the film just didn't meld well. And Tom DE santo was sorely missed in the writers chair.where do these new writers get off dramatically changing characters like rogue and Cyclops the way they did in this movie. Did Anna paquin not want to come back for another x-men movie ?...is that the reason for her being just a shadow of her former self constantly sulking around in the background moaning about not being able to get it on with her boyfriend, that character is one of the strongest in whole scheme of things and they just wipe her out of the picture.As well as the excellent Mystique one of the best characters in the bad guys camp her role was filled in by the wooden Pyro who was a whiny kiddie substitute much like the rest of the young cast. This doesn't look good for future Xmen projects. Are we going to have to sit and watch a whole new team of young Xmen in X4. With no adult guidance? just there youthful wit and good looks to keep us interested please God don't let this be true. I have heard from a very good source that used to work for Marvel that this is what is being planned, A whole new team of xmen will be in the next movie once they get through two wolverine movies first.I could go on about this all night but at the end of the day I'm just gonna come off sounding like a whining fan boy, which believe it or not I ain't. I'm just angry with the fact that Fox allowed this to happen to a great franchise. A franchise that started the whole comic book movie craze to begin with, and in my eyes has just hammered the first long rusty nail into its coffin. Save your cash stay away from this pile of crap save your money for something else....I know a ticket for Superman I'm sure it will put a smile on Singers face .",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not Half Bad,"I will admit it, I went into this movie expecting a desperate Singer-wannabee movie with no class or direction, but it appears I underestimated Brett Ratner as this may well be one of the best movies of the year. It is not without flaws, but they are insignificant under the splendour of the terrific.When a 'cure'is developed for the mutant gene, it is seen as a breakthrough by the humans and a life raft for some of the mutant population. But other (mainly Magneto and the brotherhood) see it as an insult, and declare war on the world.The only problem with this movie is the under use of many characters. Angel, Callisto, juggernaut, Mystique, Rouge and Cyclops are all side lined in favour of Storm and Logan. You can forgive this with the new villains because Toad, Sabertooth and Lady Deathstrike never did have much character time in the previous two, but neglecting Mystique was a mistake, she is definitely one of the most entertaining of the brotherhood. Rouge was the one who came closest to taking the cure, so it felt she needed more screen time to develop her pain and anger. Since Angel was this movies pretty boy on all the posters and a major character in the comic book, you you'd think he'd have an important role, but was in it for less then twenty minutes.As for the good, where do I start! The acting was the best it has ever been. Hugh Jackman was as gruff as ever of animal Wolverine, and is still as wild as ever once he starts. No matter how much everyone is going to hate this, Halle Berry was great, ten times better then she was in the last two, she is less bored and More alive now. Famke Jenssen, one of my favourite actress' and didn't disappoint as the tortured Jean Grey. In another actress' role Phonix could have been a psychopath unfeeling mass murderer, but Jenssen really brings her role to life and gains the sympathy of the audience, despite the terrible things she does, although still very scary. New comers Ben Foster, Ellen Page and Dania Demiez are all good, but are overshadowed by Kelsey Grammers Beast, as silly as he looks in a suit, he his calm and diplomatic when appropriate, but no sweat he will fight for his life. Regulars Anna Paquin, Shawn Ashmore and Patrick Stewart do as well as always, the only glitch is Aaron Stanford as the ever annoying Pyro.The plot is very Singer-esquire, you can see the writers were trying to stay close to the first two as is possible. Luckily it comes off with no obvious holes or stupid conclusions, though I'm sure somebody will find one. I would recommends staying to the very end, at the last possible second there is an important twist, and after the credits a short scene pretty much sets up X4.The special effects are extraordinary. The danger room and war scenes are amazing, I could not pick out a single fake looking frame. All the characters fight in their own unique way, even the most peaceful of mutants did not avoid getting there hands dirty. The final Jean/Logan scene is particularly special, Jean is so scary yet beautiful and Logan unusually affectionate. It reflects on his line from early on 'the whole worlds going to hell and your just gonna sit there.' It felt very appropriate and fitter very well.The comic book geek's will hate it, but what do they know! 9/10",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Big Blunder in the final battle - Joe Wood quality,"The movie is pretty nice popcorn cinema like expected with pretty special effects and lots of new shallow characters. However, considering the size of the X-Men universe you can't really fault anyone for not going into detail for each 'major' character available, especially when you expect to see new ones, too.You can, however, fault the director for starting the final battle in FULL DAYLIGHT and actually fighting it in the MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT ! And since no mutant with change-daylight-powers was mentioned, i'm ready to assume that a mutant with destroy-capabilities-for-logic-thinking-powers paid the director a visit.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Fun CGI Orgy,"I enjoyed this film, just looking at it for the striking visuals and special-effects, not really caring about the story, to be honest. I'm not into all the secular agenda that was promoted in all three of these X-Men movies, and the main ""heroes,"" who were not all that likable. They were just watch to watch to help provide the eye candy.... plenty of wild stunts and visuals, especially in this computer-generated images orgy.That's basically what it was, scene after scene of wild-looking characters with comic-book action scenes and supernatural feats by a variety of characters, all of whom had special powers. I think people who knew the previous movies forwards and backwards were hoping for more regarding the individual characters. Myself, I don't care, frankly, what happens to the wolf-man, the storm lady, boyfriends, girlfriends, kids and father--figures, mutants and humans. I just wondered if all these ""mutants"" would make the film fun to watch...and they did!Seeing the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco come apart and be transported to Alcatraz was very cool and a highlight of this special-effects. As usual, the old men, played by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, were the best characters..Was the film entertaining? Yes, as all three of the ones in the series were and, although not a big fan, I'm sorry to see it end. It was a fun ride.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Painful! Painful!,"As a life long Fangirl, I was stoked when this movie started. A ""Fastball Special"", a Sentinel, and the Danger Room within the first ten minutes? I was cheering my heart out. It looked awesome, I thought this would the best X-Men Movie ever. Man, was I wrong.The new director gutted the heart and soul out of these characters. Then Callisto, Angel, Beast, Spike, Juggernaut, and still more were thrown so fast into the mix that I had a hard time to following them all. AND I READ several X-Men titles ever month. The editing of this movie is so chopping, that it can actually cause nausea. Now that is tragic!I can only hope that Singer is free again to helm both the Magneto and Wolverine movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
They learned nothing from X2... what a shame.,"Where X2 managed to greatly outclass the first installment, this final chapter manages to mangle everything and cash in on the CGI craze. Movie making is supposed to be about the craft of fashioning a work of enjoyable, entertaining art with mass appeal. Here, they only cater to the mass appeal of mind numbing silliness of showing as many of the popular X characters as possible, without developing these characters, or melding them into the greater tapestry of an engaging plot. Mutants are being injected with a ""cure"" to their mutations. Magneto doesn't like it. Sides are drawn, and a battle royale ensues. There's several dispatchings of key characters that don't make sense, and the silliness of the plot, and the ""resolution"", make for a terrible movie experience.

"""Stand"" tall and deliver indeed, Exciting, eye dazzling, popcorn summer blockbuster! Ratner does not disappoint","***1/2 Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Kelsey Gramer, Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen, Shawn Ashmore, Jamse Mardsen. Vinnie Jones and Cameron Bright. Directed by Brett RatnerComic fans rejoice, the X-men are back and in full form. After a certain buzz with Brett Ratner taking the director's helm after Bryan Singer didn't come back. And I must say the buzz is good, Ratner does not disappoint and this may be my favorite ""X-men"" movie to date. Ratner brings in new mutants and we grow into more depth on a few of them.After a cure is found through the genes of a little child (Bright) the government decide to take charge and administer the cure to all willing. But Magneto (McKellen) enables an army of mutants and with great wrath decide to over throw the cure with force. Leading to a righteous battle at the climax of the movie. And once deceased Jean Grey (Janssen) comes back with her alter ego Phoenix raging all hell on those who get in her way.Luckily for McKellen this is his second summer movie and long awaited to after last weeks ""Da Vinci Code"" opened up. So he'll be getting a nice little pay check this month for his sky rocketing sales at the theaters.I'll admit the movie was not long and we could have used more depth into some character study but Ratner pulls it off. With showing us Kelsey Gramer's angry side as he pounces Magneto's army as Beast. A far different side from his show ""Fraiser"" but Gramer still has that clever tongue of his.The effects are well done, I was looking forward to all of May's releases ""MI:3"", ""Poseidon"", ""Da Vinci Code"" and ""X-men"" and after viewing them all ""X-men"" is the right choice. While other summer block busters to be left me cold and bored ""X-men"" does the deed to make 2006 a promising year in comic book adaptations as well as Singer's ""Super Man Returns"" movie. Which hopefully won't disappoint, but with Singer he has yet to do so. So I guess it's too early to tell.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

...oh my stars and garters...,"I have seen an awful lot of movies in my time...and I can honestly say that X-Men is one of the best, if not THE best.Of course, you'll probably know the plot. A cure has been found for mutants, and while some mutants wish to have it, others are offended by the idea of it (eg: Magneto). So, these mega p-offed mutants band together to start (and hopefully end) a war against humans. More important than this storyline however, is that of the returning Jean Grey (the GORGEOUS Famke Janssen), who, though 'dead' at the end of the last film, has come back, and is wielding some terrifyingly advanced telekinetic power. This little lady packs a decidedly powerful punch. Problem is, she's throwing these punches at everyone :SWhile significantly shorter than X2, X3 manages to pack in an awesome amount of action and IMO character. Sure, some characters who people are undoubtedly fans of (Colossus for example) get little screen-time, the leads get what they need to spark emotion. And the action, my goodness gracious, they're utterly jaw-dropping. I can honestly say that this is the only movie where my jaw has ACTUALLY dropped. The scenes of Magneto ravaging the Golden Gate Bridge, and ANY moment when Jean lets loose as Phoenix, is worthy of praise.Also, as a gay teen, I can really understand the underlying message behind these movies, and the comics themselves. And while the message is a little less subtle this time around, it's just as important.While some do bag out this movie saying it has 'hackneyed' lines etc, you've got to remember that this is a world where almost everything has been done in the movies...of course the dialogue is gonna sound clichéd...but dialogue is ALWAYS clichéd nowadays :( so deal with it, and watch the great movie that is X-Men 3 :D:D:D:D:DPS: I wanna say that I am sick and tired of people failing to mention Phoenix in reviews etc....SHE'S THE MAIN BLOODY FOCUS OF THE FILM!!! ...Sorry...I'm a bit cranky :(",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sick Movie...My 2 cents,"Alright, Alright, The movies been getting mixed reviews. Heres the scoop.... The movie isn't bad in any sense of the word. It is equal to the other two movies in my opinion.

Although he does a decent job and the movie is very good..The character development is amazing in this movie..miles ahead of its predecessors.

X-Men 3: Awesome Despite Cheap Shots,"X-Men: The Last Stand is a thrilling, and in my opinion superior, addition to the series. Never have I left the theater hoping for a sequel as much as I did after getting up from my seat after this movie.As an avid X-Men movie, comic, collector's card, and Fox cartoon fan I would like to respond to the negative reviews of this movie offered previous to its release date by some members of the IMDb community as well as other noted critics at large.1) Direction: Brett Ratner has done a phenomenal job in weaving a great, emotionally charged story, and giving the true X fans what they want to see on screen which is the awe and amazement of their animation or comic characters live on-screen for us all to look agape. Sure, it is not exactly true to the comic but how in the world is Ratner to re-create, to the T, a storyline like the Phoenix saga. Come on people -- Ratner has given us the image/ ethos of total cosmic power without attempting a feat that is digitally/film impossible at this moment. Rest assured: he weaves a bit of our comic lore with twists and turns that are gut-wrenching and stupendously visually appealing. Granted he didn't berate the relevance of the mutant scenario with regard to common levels of discrimination that we see out in the real world, but It was there, he is Not Singer, but it is A Good Thing. Ratner has found a way to balance an emotional core throughout the movie in my opinion and give us the action that was usually saved for the opening/closing in the first two films of the series.2) Miscellaneous Mutants: As we all know, Stan Lee has created a world of uncanny heroes/ villains and within a single movie we Cannot learn about the internal life and motivations of each one, nor can random non-star people like hog screen time, But what Ratner has done, with a great script, is show the different shapes, sizes, strengths mutants can come in--he gives us a taste of what everyone can do while, quite Appropriately leaving the big- budget action sequences to the mutants we all love and are invested in the most.This movie will absolutely thrill you and place you on the verge of tears and cursing at the same time throughout entire film, it will place you on the edge of your seats as it finds ways of revealing what an awesome spectacle it would be to have these characters be real, it will annoy you at times b/c It Is Not the Comic but Thrill you when you recognize and can foresee key events, it will leave you wanting more.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Its about time!,"after a early afternoon showing of x3 (the only time i could see it, even though i am an employee of a theater) i must say, the film was better then i expected.Not being a major xman fan, but a casual one, i must say i rather enjoyed x3 a great deal. Although there was the fair share of problems, overall the film was very well done and regardless of what some of the more hardcore fans might say, very entertaining. The story was well done, and the special effects were very good, and i also liked how the xmen really got into hero mode at the end of the film. For too long, it seemed to me at least, as if the xmen were super powered minorities rather then superheros, which worked well, but i must say, to see them kick it in all out superhero mode, it just seemed like they never really did it in the other 2 films.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"X-Men 3, The Best-est Movie ever. Ratner I salute you!","If your like me and never really cared for the so called subtleties and drama of X1 and X2, your gonna love this movies. Don't get me wrong I loved X1 and X2 but not because they were such 'great' movies as many of you claim and certainly not because Singer is such a 'fantastic' director, but because my favorite characters of all time were brought to life. I've seen X1 and X2 a thousand times and I never get tired of it, you know why? Because I love to see my characters, Magneto, Storm, Jean, Icy etc. Despite my unconditional love for these awesome characters, one thing more than anything else annoyed the hell out of me. They were all so damned Weak!, except for magneto. and even wolverine gets his ass kicked so bad. And rogue...?! She might as well be cured because she was introduced as a useless character to begin with. Why the hell is she necessary if she is not the real Rogue with Ms Marvel's powers. As you all know the X-men universe are about Powers not incessant posturing that the previous 2 were about. I wanted to see my X-Men unleashed. Even in X2 when Jean was suppose to show what the phoenix was about Singer held her back. She couldn't even even stop a little missile form hitting the XJet. Well I say HORAAAY! for Ratner because he did them justice. Now I know how my X-Men were meant to exist. Not only are they powerful but now they have a purpose. And even the trailers and TV Spots have more action than X1 and X2 put together........just wait till you see it!!! Its so amazing I couldn't even contain my excitement in the Theatre The only thing I don't really like about this movie is that fact that the feel the need to dispose of certain characters in order to achieve strong emotions. I'm sure they could have come up another way to make the movie more poignant. So in closing...Yes the movie feels rushed, Yes it is short, Yes the story could have been better, Yes some characters could have been more detailed but guess what...This is ten times better than X1 and X2.

The worst X-Men movie,"I've seen five times the first movie, twice the second one, while I won't do the same with X3: OK, in this movie you'll find a lot of characters, but only few ideas, poor dialogs and another last sequence suggesting a possible X-Men 4. More, I had the feeling that there were characters practically useless to the plot, or not well-defined. The movie is someway grotesque but not dramatic, too unreal even for a comic book. ""BOOMS"" and ""BANGS"" are not enough to make the movie interesting. Concluding, you might want to see Episode 1 'cause you're a Star Wars fan, and perhaps you'd like to see X3 'cause you're an X-Men fan, but it's not worth the price, definitely.

Wishing There Was More To It,"Never having read the comic books I view the XMen movies as just that - movies. I loved the first two but was slightly disappointed with the third installment.This film is darker and more intense than the first two - the development of Jean Grey as the Phoenix is a fantastic storyline, and Famke Janssen is amazing as a woman with no control over the creature that lives within her soul. She is at once evil, lost, confused, dangerous and lovable.However, with the second storyline concerning a mutant ""cure"" taking up most of the screen time the Dark Phoenix story is pushed into the background and this brings out the faults with the film. Some of the dialogue is missing the sharpness and wit of the first two movies and there are more new mutants introduced in this than there were in the second movie - and thus, not many (if any) are given much character development. The Cure storyline overshadows the more emotional and important Phoenix storyline and as a result almost every mutant seems out of character.That aside the direction is good - the final fight is amazing, as is the heartbreaking scene between Jean and Wolverine. Watch till the end of the credits for an extra scene.With surprises around every corner and a higher death count than the first two films combined, XMen 3 does its' best to end the trilogy in a satisfactory way, but you just can't help but wish that there was more to it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is a good ending to the very popular franchise however with a little more time and effort this movie could have been the best out of all three.","This time around, the X-Men have a big issue their hands because a scientist has recently discovered a cure for mutants that will turn them back into normal human beings. But the situation only gets worse as Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) rises from the dead and comes back as her alter ego the Dark Phoenix. It isn't long before Phoenix becomes a threat not only the X-Men but the world as well. A decent however problematic final installment of the popular franchise ensues""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is really a mixed bag. There were so many things I liked about the film however there was a lot I didn't like about it as well. With that being said I really loved the first hour and feel it was better than the previous films. It was very dramatic and very intense. I enjoyed every moment of the first hour or so but when one of the main characters die, the movie seems to fall apart. At this point, it becomes solely about action and special effects and that's where I lost some interest in the film.The main problem I had with the movie is that nothing is ever really explained or shown. I can't really go into detail about this without giving the movie away but trust me there are a few things in the film that never get addressed including some casualties. The film also really builds up the Dark Phoenix character but again never really explains who she is and why she has this power.Also this movie features a lot of new characters including Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page), Beast ( Kelsey Grammar), and Angel (Ben Foster) just to name a few but there is zero character development with these new characters. Who are they? Why are they here? We as the audience don't get any answers to these questions. Also where did Night Crawler disappear to? And why was Rogue almost non-existent during the entire film? I also felt that a lot of the new characters weren't very loyal to the comic book. Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) was an absolute joke as a character and his little stupid one-liners didn't help. In fact all the cheesy one-liners were awful. Also whose idea was it to cast Kesley Grammar as the Beast? That was a total miscast because he seemed very out of place in the film. Beast also seemed a lot smarter in the comic. Lastly, the ending was a bit too much as well, the whole idea that yet another sequel could come out of the franchise really made me mad. I really couldn't help but burst out laughing when it ended.But with all negatives aside, the first hour of this film was terrific. I liked the drama that Brett Ratner introduced in the film and I liked how he allowed the film to actually have a story. The problem is that the film was very unbalanced and it seemed to rely on action and special effects more than anything else in the second half. Just a little character development would have made the film a lot better. Also some introductions of the new characters would have been great as well. I honestly don't know who most of the new characters were in the film. It seemed as though these characters didn't have names and weren't important.In the end, ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" probably would have better if the original director, Bryan Singer, stayed on board. The fact that this film is suppose to be the final film of the X-Men saga it wasn't a good time for a new director to take over the series. It was a decent ending to the series however as a whole ""the Last Stand"" was my least favorite film of the bunch. It was very dramatic, intense and action packed, I will give it that. However, the problem seemed to me that Brett Ratner tried to do too much with the final film. He introduced too many new characters and the fact that everything seemed to move along so fast really hurt the film. I think a bit more story later on in the film and a little character development and explanation about things would have made this film the best film in the series but since a new director stepped aboard it was only good instead of being great. With that being said I did like this film however I was kind of disappointed with it in the end. It's a good ending to a popular franchise that with just a little more time and effort could have been great.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" is a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
People are being way too hard on this extremely fun comic book film...,"I saw it tonight and loved it. Yes I am a recovering comic book geek. No they don't follow the comic book continuity exactly. Name one comic book movie that has! You can't. Instead we got exactly more of what we got before in the last two installments. Characters that we care about i.e. wolverine, professor x etc. Thrilling set pieces and cool bad guys. Some of it gave me chills and even brought a tear to my girlfriends eye. (who isn't a x- men fan btw) There are a lot of cameos and easter eggs in this one for the HARDCORE x-men geeks like me. But its still very accessible to the every day moviegoer.So I give Brett Ratner credit on this. Ratner did the best he could in the limited about of time he had to make this movie(and it was limited) and therefore parts of it feel a little rushed. It feels like it could have used another 15-20 minutes. The good news is though, that you will probably get it on the DVD that is sure to be released later this year.It doesn't follow any x-men storyline exactly but ya know what? THAT IS OK!

"X-men 3, the best movie of 2006","I saw X-men 3 on Saturday and I was impressed. The actors produced good acting and the action sequences were superb! The director could have done without killing off some characters, never the less Brett Ratner did not disappoint with his new approach in the third instalment of x-men. The title suggests that this film is the final film however, I don't think we have seen the last of the X-men films. The only complaint Ihave is that the film is not long enough. We wanted to see more ass kicking. The film could have hadlonger action sequences and less dialogue. Some parts also try to deliver humour but fail, I won't mention any names, Juggernaught.Do not listen to the critics who slated the movie just because it wasn't accurate to the comics its a movie worth seeing.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Last Stand to what?,"I remember loving the first two movies. I also remember getting more and more excited as I watched both movies when they were released in the theaters. Yes, they changed a few details in order to make the live action believable, but as a moviegoer, I really didn't care. I just wanted the movie to stay true to the spirit of the comic without sacrificing too much of what the readers have come to love about the comic books.And while I never felt it made much of a difference between directors, I now can see why directors make such a big difference for a movie. It's the difference between a Steven Spielberg film and a Stanley Kubrick film.In this case, it's the difference between a fantastic movie director and a mediocre movie director that made a name for himself by helping put Jackie Chan on the map (ahem. Rush Hour anyone?)Clocking in at barely 1 hr and 39 minutes, there just was not enough time allotted to any of the characters. Little to no character development and lots of Kraft cheese laid on top with the expectation that we as an audience don't know the difference. Psylocke was in the movie? Where? Jubilee too? and Siryn? WTF?!?It became painfully obvious after watching it a second time that they needed to make this movie at least 20 minutes longer. Plenty of action, not enough plot or character development. It just tried to do too much at once.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
As Alien 3 is to Aliens...,"In 2000 and 2003, two films appeared in cinemas that reaffirmed the old adage. The more you take the source material seriously when adapting a comic book to the big screen, the more successful the adaptation will be. There is another adage in film these days, namely that when the first sequel is as thrilling and life-affirming to watch as X-Men 2 was, the next sequel will be a horrendous disappointment. X-Men 3 upholds this adage like a badge of honour. To be fair, I was expecting a disappointment, but alarm bells started to ring in my head as soon as I saw that Brett Ratner had asked someone to proclaim that Einstein was not a mutant. It has been confirmed both through archival footage and the testimony of individuals who knew the man that Einstein, like Bill Gates or myself, was as close to the real-world equivalent of being a mutant as it gets. And unfortunately, with a war of words raging being Aspies and the normalists who wish to ""cure"" them, the rest of the film is insulting to the same people who cheered for X-Men 2.Among Brett Ratner's problems is an attempt to weave two plot lines together. The aforementioned curebie war is enough to sustain at least one three-hour film. Sadly, Brett tries to weave it in with the Phoenix saga, a piece of X-Men lore to which a mound of comic books as thick as a standard hardback has been devoted. This, combined with a running time that cannot sustain either plot idea, dooms the film to a ceiling of mediocrity. Another problem for Ratner is his inability to treat the demands of his cast in the manner they deserve. Halle Berry, the worst actor of both previous films, demanded a leading role, and her name appears in the leading credits of the theatrical poster. Bryan Singer would have listened to her demands before informing her the door is behind her. Put simply, she is not capable of carrying a film, and hopefully X-Men 3 will be the last time she gets the chance. Hugh Jackman does his best to outfight her mediocrity, but it is no coincidence that the worst scenes all feature her prominently. Contrary to what she seems to think, she is about as much a mutant as I am a normie.Another big problem lies in the action sequences. The previous two films kept them small, on the level of duels. As a result, the camera-work made them easy to follow, and the judgement of which side was doing what was easy. In X-Men 3, the camera whips around like a drunk in occasional shots, and making out who is fighting what gets confusing in a hurry. Making matters worse is that, in a total contrast to X-Men 2, Ratner is unable to provide a compelling reason for Xavier's mutants to fight Magneto's. Sure, Xavier and his people are dedicated to forging an alliance with humankind, but considering the behaviour of the humans in this film, that Xavier's soldiers would stoop to defending the human contingent from Magneto and his cohorts beggars belief. Find an Aspie and ask them if they would defend people who are trying to force a cure upon them from an organised Aspie army looking to prevent forced cures by any means necessary. Brett Ratner seems to think the answer is yes. Looking up the words Aspies For Freedom on the Wikipedia, for instance, will tell you a very different story.And that is the one crippling problem that X-Men 3 cannot get past. I do not know if this story was put into production because someone half-read the war of words I just spoke of and thought it would be topical, but they fumbled the ball from the get-go. What I do know is that aside from Rogue, no mutant in this film has a shred of motivation to take the cure. Were I making this film, I would have included at least one scene of a mutant who has suffered terrible abuse due to their mutations being told happily that there is a cure by family members who fail to understand the extent of their suffering. Said mutant would tell them what to go and do with themselves, simply saying ""I do not wish to become any more like you"". Considering how much abuse the normalists put anyone who shows any difference, positive or otherwise, from them through, one would expect this scenario to be literally dominated by such scenes.Are there good parts to this film? Well, yes, it is not a complete write-off. Ian McKellen proves once again that he knows far more about the subject matter than either director in the series, and that is not meant to be a put-down to Bryan Singer. Ian just hits the right notes without fail in every scene, no matter how badly written or directed it may be. I still wonder if Ratner really intended for the final shot to so accurately depict how one of our world's real mutants would feel about being cured. Hugh Jackman also manages to hit the right note every time he is in a scene, and proves himself to be at least worthy of acting in the same set as Ian. Kelsey Grammar is a very pleasant surprise, as I had always associated him with Republican politics. That he is able to portray an intelligent mutant struggling to diplomatically solve the communication problem is a credit to him. Vinnie Jones also gives a great performance as Juggernaut, portraying a mad and dangerous man as only Vinnie Jones can. So we can say at least they got the casting right, although Ratner criminally underutilises some of its best parts such as Anna Paquin.In short, X-Men 3 is a three out of ten film. On its own, it is decent, but compared to its two ten out of ten predecessors, it is insulting.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best in series but could have been a tiny bit better,"I went to go see the movie on 5.26.06 and was blown out of the water. What I witnessed was certainly the best movie in the whole x-men series. The first element in the puzzle was the cast. Kelsey Grammar was a brilliant choice for the beast. Also I thought that Vinnie Jones was astounding as the Juggernaut. The puzzle piece was the fact that the script was written well. The danger room scene is a perfect example the witty banter combined with the serious under tones make the movie what it is.Now There were some things that could have used a tiny tweaking. Like the fact that some of the coolest characters had such small roles in the movie. Cyclopse was barley in it same with Colossus and Multiple Man. But that is the only complaint I had about the movie.So all in all I give the movie a 9 out of ten. I think that Brett Ratner did a better job than singer ever did. So I recommend to the movie to every one not just the comic fans. My friend went with me who doesn't know much about X-Men but, still loves the movie. So go see it but first . . .STAY UNTIL THE CREDITS ARE OVER!!!!! Lets just say you will be surprised.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Couldn't think of an ""X-"" pun","To be honest this is nowhere near as bad as I had feared. Third installmentitis hovers at the edge of your visual fields throughout; it just never comes into view. Very little character development has taken place - that that has is fairly extreme and binary in nature, good/bad sort of stuff. All SFX are up to expected standards, but nothing we've not seen before. Acting is very much by the numbers. There are enough new characters to keep ringing the changes, however, perhaps not enough concentration on those that we are familiar with. The script and ideas seem excellent - perhaps in other hands a darker film was lurking which could have been so much more satisfying for a conclusion. In essence; 100 minutes of crowd-pleasing bunkum with enough mythos to probably keep the fan-boys happy.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
XMen3 review,"As a huge comic book fan, i tend to watch movies based on their properties on two levels, one as a fan of the original source material, and two, as a fan of film itself. On many comic themed message boards, director Brett Ratner has been accused of not respecting the original XMen comics, which i found to be completely untrue. Nevermind that Ratner is a self-professed X-Fan, the entirety of XMen3 is a massive Fangasm payoff for fans of the comic. The whole movie is chock full of fan geek out moments, and a couple really good ""Holy @#$%....I cant believe that just happened"" plot twists. Thus, X3 gets my whole-hearted recommendation for fans of the comic. But as most of the movie going public are not comic book readers, they might find this movie somewhat disappointing. The first two XMen films were sci-fi/action masterpieces, the third film in the trilogy (im reasonably certain the series is intended to be a trilogy) is an out and out comic book film, So expect a few hokey and over the top moments. I think that the overall story was great, but the plot itself felt a little rushed through. The filmmakers were trying to cram a lot of material into an under 2 hour film and unfortunately it shows. I surmise that the DVD will have plenty of deleted and extended scenes. For this XMen outing, the cast has been extended considerably, allowing for a lot of great scenes, which unfortunately come at the expense of any in depth character and plot development. Also, though we've seen many of these characters in previous XFilms, little or no explanation is given as to how they've found themselves in the spotlight so suddenly. I almost felt as though i was joining the movie already in progress. The movie left me wanting more, but what I wanted more of should have been in the self-same movie. So, in conclusion, X3 gets a 6.5 out of 10. It's good, but fails to live up to the high water mark left by Singer's films. If you're a long time XFAn....definitely see it, if you want a big budget, popcorn munching good time, go see it. But if you want a worthy end to an epic science fiction saga, you may find yourself disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"New Director, Same Greatness","I went to see the movie twice in a few hours. I saw the opening 12:01 am showing on 5/26 as well as seeing the 5:50 showing. As well as watching X-Men, and X-Men 2 back to back a few hours before my first showing.Now let me get things straight I am not a HUGE X-Men big, but I am a fairly big X-Men fan meaning that I know more beyond the three movies. The movie was very greatly done, and very emotional. It was a little boring and stretched on at first but started to pick up.Jean Grey/Phenoix was done just so well, her lines seemed so real. And everything was done perfectly with her character. The newer characters however got a lack of screen time but it worked in the end, you really see the characters change.Now if you one of those people who shred apart movies thats the only way I can see someone saying its bad. If they are going to bash it because a lot of people like it, because its a sequel, or because there die hard comic fans (those are justifed though the comic fans) but you got to ask yourself in the end did you enjoy it for all movies....If your not out to bash, this movie is great. The movie is so well done, and beutifull as good maybe better than the first two. X-Men fans, and moviegoers alike go out and see this now!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Last Stand......And A New Beginning,"I just watched this movie today on its UK premier and even though a lot of us(fans) were moaning about how short the movie is, including me, but to tell you the truth, it was worth it. Brett Ratner has done a good job from start to finish. Many said there're too many characters and not enough character development, but do you really need them? My answer is, if you want character development then read the comics, because the film is not about Juggernaut or Callisto or any of the other mutants. The trilogy circulates around the fight between Magneto and his comrades against Xavier and his X-men, everything that come between are just there to add flavour. I don't want to get into the story because you all know it, But I will say this, you won't be disappointed if you liked the first 2. Yes you might be shocked to see some of the mutants Lost but if you read the comics, then you would know that Time travelling Mutants exist!(If you know what I mean ^_^) In my opinion this movie is great fun to watch and a good ending for the Trilogy...9/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
anyone who argues this isn't good sucks!,"to these posts that this movie ""sucked if you are a comic book/xmen fan"".what are you all on? everything that happens in this movie has HAPPENED in a comic book. they didn't screw up the plot, like Brian singer did in the 1st 2, attempting to use drama and humanism as the driving forces for his climax. it was exactly how xmen has always been on paper or cartoon: fast paced action with some dialoguing.Ratner did an incredible job with this movie, and portrayed the characters exactly how they should have been: like mutants. in the 1st 2 movies, their mutant powers as quasi-impressive, barely used, and lackluster. there is an explosion of identification with what these beings are truly capable of, in the eyes of Stan lee. you can go ahead and say that you don't like it because it doesn't run long and ragged like the 1st 2 xmen. but don't say u don't appreciate the movie because it doesn't relate to or follow comics, because trust me it does(ex story lines- Age of Apocalypse, wolverine(self titled), astonishing xmen, etc etc).in short, this movie is the perfected vision xmen fans should be looking for. anyone who doesn't feel the same way would probably tell you cyclops is their favorite xmen.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men: The End?,"The best and most emotional movie of the trilogy. This is what the director, Brett Ratner, and the actors involved have said of X-Men: The Last Stand. This year's Revenge of the Sith? Not really: it's not as astonishing as the final Star Wars chapter (or, staying in X-Men territory, the amazing second installment), but it has the degree of spectacular that makes it count as a solid franchise epilogue (assuming it really is the last film in the series, that is).The Last Stand's premise is based on a recent X-Men storyline written by Joss ""Buffy"" Whedon: we learn of the existence of a young mutant(Cameron Bright, aka the ""creepy boy"" from Godsend and Birth), whose very particular ""gift"" is to make other mutants powerless if they're too close to him. So far, though, the loss is temporary. If, however, you receive the ""cure"", obtained from the boy's DNA, you will become ""normal"". Forever.This discovery causes three main reactions: some mutants, including Angel (Ben Foster), a winged teenager whose father financed the making of the ""cure"", and Rogue (Anna Paquin), who, because of her abilities, can't even kiss or touch her boyfriend, see it as a miracle; Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his students, particularly Storm (Halle Berry), think it's ridiculous, given being a mutant isn't a disease you can just get rid of; and then we have Magneto (Ian McKellen), who immediately realizes the truth: let the humans have it their way, and the mutant race will be completely and irreversibly exterminated. Which means, the ultimate war is about to begin. In addition, the X-Men have to deal with another issue: Jean Grey (Famke Janssen, at her best), back from the dead and more powerful than ever (she's a Level 5 mutant, virtually invincible, whereas Xavier and Magneto are Level 4). In fact, her personality has been replaced by a more aggressive one known as the Phoenix. Translation: the proverbial thing is going to hit the fan.The main pre-release complaint made by fans was the departure of director Bryan Singer, who moved on to resurrecting Superman on the big screen. His replacement, Rush Hour director Brett Ratner, maintains the same tone and, like Singer, aims for something a bit more breathtaking in scale compared to the previous film. Starting with a Danger Room sequence, blatantly inspired by the famous Days of a Future Past storyline, and tying the two plot arcs (The Cure and the Dark Phoenix Saga) together in an epic confrontation as good as anything Singer would have come up with, he manages to deliver action and suspense without sacrificing the story's heart for the sake of comedy (as seen in the Rush Hours). Actually, sometimes the action overshadows parts of the story, with key subplots from previous installments - the Rogue-Iceman situation most notably - being sidestepped to make room for new characters (not that it's a bad thing, when you have someone like Kelsey Grammar playing Beast). This, paired with a running time that is, astonishingly enough, shorter than that of X2, means that while the overall result is pretty satisfying, there are some specific sections that could have used more work.Bottom line: this might not be the last official X-Men film (the last two scenes, one of which plays after the closing credits, seem to suggest a fourth chapter is possible), but if it is, it's a worthy, if not entirely accomplished swansong. Then again, asking a new director to outdo someone else's work is a pretty big challenge, so Ratner deserves credit for accepting the challenge and delivering an intelligent, exciting summer blockbuster - an X-flick worthy of the name.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Stupid Comic Book Nerds,"OK so I was the movie twice and I think it was great. I think Brett Ratner did a great job on this movie. He was called in late and had the task of pulling a movie out his butt. He did more than that. He did a great job. The movie had action and emotion. It was true to the franchise. The characters all grew up, but stayed the same. So stop complaining that ""it's not the same as the comics"" because guess what? Pretty much every book that is made into a movie is changed in some way. It's not always easy to translate something exactly and Brett did a good job. Singer probably might have not done as well. In fact when we see this Superman dude, it's probably going to suck. I've seen the preview. Ooh no save a plane, ooh no die from kryptonite. Same ol' same ol'. Superman=pansy and Singer didn't deserve to do X-Men. So that's what I think. All you whiny comic nerds. STFU!",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
An ALMOST perfect movie,"I realize that the dialog for this movie was written using the incredibly important book of Clichés, Puns, and Predictability, which is pretty much essential for any movie to even be considered on par with films like Citizen Kane or Schindler's List, which I should just add this movie certainly is, but what could have made it excel way beyond them, and become the greatest film ever would be if they had also used a rhyming dictionary. Just think how much more tension could have been added to the final climatic scene if Jean Grey had said something like this to Wolverine:Wolverine It'd be keen If you shoved your claws In my SpleenOr better yet, my suggestion for X-Men 4, have the whole movie written in iambic pentameter. Either that or they should all speak in the for of a rap. Also they should have like 30 more kittens licking Wolverine's claws. Also they should have Steve Urkel come in to replace Professor X as they leader of the team, but he can constantly be screwing things up, but seriously, who can really stay mad at him. The big climax of the movie can be Urkel asking a girl he likes out to a dance, and her agreeing to go. It'll be a really touching moment.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Different but still good.,"Saw this last night.Gotta say, woah. I had read a lot of spoilers for this film and there was still major surprises.No real spoilers ahead. Just talking about unspecific characterization. Ratner definitely has a different style then Singer. While Singer didn't quite get the characters right (at least not the way they should be been from the comics) Ratner does. However, he doesn't really develop his characters properly. It's missing the subtlety of X-men 1 & 2. It's still amazing, but I wish it had taken its time more.Of the new characters, Beast in spot-on and had just enough screen time to really get to know him. Angel, on the other hand, despite being set-up for decent characterization is really shortchanged. Phoenix, too, while getting plenty of screen time could have been explained better.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing! Well worth the wait.,"Like most X-Fans i've been waiting for this movie ever since seeing the phoenix in the water at the end of X2. Recently people who attended press screenings and various critics etc. had given this film a lot of flak which upon viewing this excellent film I can only suppose is due to their dislike of Brett Ratner. I'm not a fan of Brett's previous work but he obviously wanted to stay close to the source material- both the comics and previous films. The film itself is full of wonderful set pieces, fantastic special effects and great acting. James Marsden, who plays a small yet important part gives a great performance as the grief stricken cyclops.All the other actors are excellent including Ellen Page who gives a standout performance as Kitty Pride.

Not as bad as it sounds!,I thought this would be a lot worse. It looks rubbish well so I thought. I had seen the other two movies but not for a while. I new it would be a typical formula of blasting special effects around a loose story line. (How could it be otherwise) But I enjoyed it. It doesn't weigh up to the Spiderman movies.I love seeing two heavyweight British actors in Ian Mckellen and Patrick Stewart together.This film is great to look at and lots of fun. Typical of the Hollywood sequel formula but full of humour and makes for a great night out to the cinema.

Disappointed,"I didn't think it was possible to mess up the X-men franchise since you've got almost all the same actors and actresses coming back and a decent storyline to work with as well. Well, Ratner once again proves that under his direction, there are no bounds-especially on the downside. After all, who could forget ""After the Sunset""?The previous X-men movies were so good that one hoped that the series could go out in style. Instead, we get this mediocre picture to close out the trilogy. After seeing the movie, I felt that I could have just watched the trailer and I would have basically experienced all this movie had to offer. I don't want to be too critical of this movie though. The movie isn't terrible in the absolute sense but compared to the previous two movies, it just pales in comparison. The pace of the movie was very rushed and it was obvious that they tried to cram everything in within the time frame.The movie tries to maintain a decent storytelling pace in the first hour or so. There is an actual attempt at character and plot development instead of full-blown popcorn action. Unfortunately, the problem here was they were throwing in various scenes that did not support the main story lines. There were clearly way too many mutants and it seemed a lot of them were just putting in face-time and showing off their powers. All in all, it just seems they were trying to jam all this footage in without taking the time out to develop and make it good.What also bothered me was the Phoenix storyline. It did not fit well with the mutant cure storyline. It almost seems like half the time she's standing there bored waiting for her turn at camera time. In my opinion, they should have just made this movie solely about the Phoenix and explored her evil side. Perhaps she goes on a rampage or something and then it culminates in the obvious big battle. Now, THAT would have been a movie. The mutant cure story wasn't bad, just this movie wasn't long enough to support two plots. The action and CGI are top notch of course. They do not disappoint at all.I just hope they change their minds and make another X-men movie. Surely, they can't let this be remembered as the last X-men movie. There are good scenes and acting performances scattered throughout the movie that keep it enjoyable and prevent it from being a disaster like the Punisher or Daredevil. I just wondered if someone had properly managed the flow and execution of this movie *cough* Singer *cough, how great this movie would have been?

Could Have Been Better,"From the very start of the movie, it felt like it was missing something ... Oh yea, it was ... Bryan Singer. The man who created the franchise and then abandoned it when it needed him the most. This COULD have been the best one of the three. Darker plot, great action, but it didn't have touch that Singer gave it to make it great. Granted you will be shocked (REALLY SHOCKED) when you watch this movie, but it left me with a feeling of what if, rather than awe. The only reason I can imagine why Singer left was the script. It wasn't great, but it wasn't awful. Some of the sub-plots were worthless, but I can't blame Singer for that. So on behalf of all the grateful fans of the first two (great) movies, thank you Mr. Singer. I hope Superman was worth it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Finally!  Some Sex in the Series,"X-Man: The Last Stand is not a disappointment after all. Many - myself included - were more than skeptical about the third, and supposedly final entry, when a new director was announced. It's not so much that we all loved Bryan Singer (although his first two entries were respectful, solid entertainments) as much as that we really don't like Brett Ratner (who made the immediately forgettable Rush Hour series, the unendurable Family Man, and the absolutely abominable Red Dragon). It's a wonder why any studio would enlist Ratner to head a popular franchise, as he aptly demonstrated how to ruin one with Red Dragon. Maybe my dislike is much more simple. Maybe I was skeptical because I can't imagine a serious film director whose name is BRETT RATNER, who hails from Miami Beach, Florida, and who looks like this (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0711840/).I'm being terribly cruel. But the news is good! In fact, I wouldn't put up much of a fight to the statement that The Last Stand is the best X-Men thus far (please, for a series so grave in it's pleas for diversity and tolerance, let's change the title to X-People). The third entry is the tightest in the series  with a taut, intricate storyline, and a slew of new mutants. Once again, Ian Mckellen is here to make meager lines ring Shakespearean, and finally, the now 40 year-old, still absolutely ravishing, Famke Janssen is back from the dead. Well, in fact, she never died, as fans of the comic-book already knew.And this I'll say for Ratner, when he does give Famke Janssen screen time (she's not on screen for more than 15 minutes), he uses her splendidly - better than Singer ever did, or ever could. In the first two X-Men, her beauty was distant and almost motherly (she was the mother, and Wolverine and Cyclops were her disobedient children desperately seeking her approval and love)  she had no sex appeal. Here she is all woman, and in the film's best scene, she gives us one of the better seductions in cinema this year. After a dangerously long kiss with Cyclops which results in the latter's death, she wakes up at home base, not completely herself. She's got split personality issues  she's both the sweet, tender Jean Grey and the destructive Phoenix. She wakes, wearing a skimpy black tank top and an even skimpier pair of black shorts. Wolverine is beside her, drooling over her. ""You're making me blush."" She says. ""You're reading my mind?"" He asks her. ""I don't have to."" Then she sits up and delicately straddles him with her thighs. She's hungry, and I had to wonder: isn't it strange that Phoenix's first two appearances are lust driven, and unfulfilled? Would Phoenix be such a threat if Wolverine had set aside his personal doubts and given in to the passion of the moment? Is Phoenix really blood-thirsty or just extremely horny?There is another strong, female actress in the film that makes Phoenix/Grey's dilemma all the more transparent. This actress is the lovely Anna Paquin (terribly neglected here), who longs to be cured of her power so she can finally touch and kiss and screw her boyfriend (she can put people in a coma with a handshake, or worse). These mutant women are tired of being ""special"" and ""powerful"". They just want to be held, they just want to be loved.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
this movie is plop!!,"these past 2 movies have been alright nothing wow! the first was the best and now i thought all these comic characters being in the movie, a new director, the Phoenix saga! i said to my self, ""oh my god i have to see this movie it must be so good!!""

But the movie does not give us the sense that Phoenix is so strong.I do not like that Professor and Cyclops died.On the other hand i like the scene with the bridge.

Best of the three,"After the very good first movie and the completely forgettable sequel I wasn't expecting much from X-Men: The Last Stand. In fact I was just hoping to see some good action and visual effects. After the first few minutes I realised I was in for a surprise.The story is very dark, sometimes quite close to a horror movie. What's cool about this movie is that it has a feel of a Twilight Zone episode. There is closure, maybe not what fans wanted, but it signifies the end of the series.The visual effects are incredible, very organic looking. In fact you don't notice them, they're that good. I think they are the best visual effects to date. This may sound pompous but it is true. When I saw King Kong I could tell I was was watching animated graphics. In X-Men 3 the visual effects are integrated flawlessly into the real elements. Perfection.Do not miss out on this movie. It is an exiting adventure, the best Marvel movie to date.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What an Excellent Film...Much better than the other two.,"I was also very surprised at this film's quality. This film was very good especially for a third installment of the X-men. After reading the book, I went to see the movie. It was so easy to compare. I enjoyed both but I believe that the movie was a lot better. I couldn't believe how great the acting was. Patrick Stewart and Ian Mclellan were perfect as Xavier and Magneto. The Plot this time was better being the entrance of Dark Phoenix. This film was my favorite of the three. Also the number of new mutants made this film enjoyable. If you are looking for a great film to see this summer or this week, this is the Film for any adventure goer.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A treat for  X-Men and sci-fi fans,"This is the long anticipated final in a trilogy of films based on the popular American comic book heroes,The uncanny X-Men.The storyline is based on a world where mutants exist. Human who have special powers or gifts. One of them, Charles Xavier envisions a society where human beings and mutants will peacefully co-exist. He establishes a school where young mutants can escape from the worlds prejudice. They are also trained to use and control their powers.Another Mutant called Magneto believes that mutants are superior to humans. They are the next step in the evolutionary ladder. He gathers a group of mutants and launches a crusade to dominate the human race.In this film, a rich businessman funds a scientific project that yields a vaccine for the genes that give mutants their gifts .He is motivated by the fact that his son is a mutant. The vaccine is proved to be successful. Mutants are divided as some seek a cure and others seek to maintain their gifts.Furthermore, one of the X-Men called Jean Grey, who was thought to have died in the previous installment comes back to life. She becomes more powerful than any other mutant. Unfortunately, She leaves the X-Men and decides to side with Magneto,The film is quite easy to follow. The characters are great. Almost each character has their own separate storyline. Some of the dialogue is quite humorous . Hats of to the special effects team. The mutant powers exhibited by the characters and their effects are very credible. Fights are well choreographedEthical issues raised by the films are very relevant to today's society. If a cure could be found for the misfits of society, would people be willing to take It ? Is it right for one person to control another for the benefit of society? The reality of death is also treated with due respect. Most significant of all, the need for individuals to stand for righteousness regardless of personal feelings or opposition.The violence, although rather frequent and voluminous, is not bloody or gory. Nevertheless it is debatable whether the film should be given a 12A certificate. In one of the scenes a totally nude woman is seen lying on the floor. Some of the characters have little regard for human life, as seen by the way they kill mercilesslyScreen veterans Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart put in some superb performances. Kelsey Grammar, well known as doctor Frasier Brain from the hit 80's TV series "" Cheers"", also adds to the magic. In a change from the earlier films, former beauty queen Halle Berry plays more of a leading role.Overall this is a good film for adults and teenage children. The hype prior to its release is justified after watching the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Whoo Hoo!  Let's go for X-Men four!,"A very good third installment to the series, but remember, just cause it's called ""The Last Stand"" doesn't mean it's the last movie. Be sure to stay until after the credits too, there's something waiting for you at the very end.I became a fan of X-men only a few weeks ago when we rented the first two from Blockbuster, and boy was I hooked! Superheros have become my new favorites. There's plenty of action to satisfy the fans of the last two movies. I heard there was a new director but to be honest I didn't even notice any changes, and I actually pay attention to those kinds of things. Enjoy it!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The best one in terms of catching the tone of the comics, unreasonable hate!","X-Men Last Stand has too much CGI may be and it is not as powerful and brilliant as the first two, but that doesn't mean that Brett Ratner did a bad job! The Last Stand is probably one of the most enjoyable movies ever made. Honestly, the opening scene was a bit disappointing, I worried a bit (if the rest of the movie is like that) because they had tried to get Magneto and Professor X look younger by CGI. However, the movie has a second opening scene which rocks! Then, the movie has a little surprise for you, we see it for the first time, in any X-Men movie. Yes, there are some weak points in The Last Stand, but it does not deserve such a hate and low rating. The second movie was deeper, so more powerful, this third chapter is rather entertainment, pure entertainment, but I cannot see any further flaw. Instead, for example, the tone of the movie is very close to the tone of the comics and the animation which is a success. For example, while watching the scene which Cyclops goes to find Jean, it feels like I was watching the animation. Beast was a disappointment, he is too calm, too small and too thin in comparison with the original character, so he does not seem a threat to anyone. Moreover, it would have been better, if they had not gotten him wear suit. He is a doctor, not a politician. Some moments are showy that I don't like. For example, the introduction of the abilities of the new characters. However, as said, there is not any further problem in the movie. There are a lot of scenes that I watched tons of times and still do! The scene which Mystique appears first, a brilliant scene, stylish, like the first movie. The convoy scene was great, we see Magneto's power by an amazing scene. The second visit to Jean was great too. Very enjoyable and a scene that recalls the animation. And it ends by a petrifying event. By the way, there is a brilliant shot while Wolverine Juggernaut fight, I just love that. The forest scenes are also entertaining and stylish. As for the bridge scene, again amazing, but Ratner falls into the trap, he shows cliché moments like the tourist who takes photos. And CGI in all those scenes are not cheesy at all. I have mentioned a lot of entertaining and amazing scenes with good CGI, but still it has not finished yet. It is weird that most audiences don't like super hero movies with a lot of action and fun. It seems like that. Because, why people love Iron Man or The Incredible Hulk but hate The Last Stand? Iron Man was entertaining, but there was much humor than action. The very long last part of X-Men 3 is amazing! This is a non stop action, fantasy movie also. In the last part, The only minor problem was that many mutants could fly which is exaggerating. I don't like Vinnie Jones, he is not appropriate for the character and the character was very different than this one (like The Beast), but the Juggernaut scene, the camera shots were amazing too. There is another surprise related to Iceman by the way, I like this character very much, even if he is a teen in contrast with the original character and the screen time of him is unsatisfying in X-Men movies. And the final parts makes you say that's it! Brett Ratner's best work!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
For afaithfulday of Michigan,"The movie was decent and entertaining. Was it great, absolutely not. But when has a sequel, especially the second, been great. As far as the movie industry/box office goes, the numbers have been great the past few weeks. The movie industry has been bouncing back as of late. X-Men 3 has broken a couple of records at the box office. I work in the movie industry, I know the numbers. Yes there are some horrible movies that come out of Hollywood, but there are also some great films too. The movie business is a risk. A director and producer don't know if a movie is going to make a profit or not (do well or not) until they release the film. So yes there are crappy films and great films. If Hollywood is supposedly releasing crap then don't watch it. Nobody is holding a gun to your head. Go home and sit in you little utopia where everything is supposedly perfect.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A bit disappointed,"Okay, this movie wasn't that good because of the fact that it was rushed. It was only 104 minutes, it should have been longer, and in that extra time they could have explained more of what was going on. I loved the first 2 movies, but I thought they could have had more battles in them, and once i saw the third one, i saw that they were better, because without all the dialogue, it's too jumpy and instead of telling you more about it, they go into a battleThings they could have done better 1.) introduced kitty a little better, she wasn't even a minor character in the first 2, and now she is bumped up to fight on the team 2.)WHERE DID NIGHTCRAWLER GO???? he never died in second one, he didn't show up at all in third, there's a problem. 3.) whats the point of having angel in the movie when he doesn't even fight, all he did was save his father at the end and disappeared. 4.)Why did Rogue do it, i don't think she should have gave up her powers, she would have been cool in the final battle. 5.)Cyclops dies??? he was barely in it before he died, disappointing 6.)Mystique, I like the fact that she saved magneto, but she shouldn't have lost her powers, and magneto just left her, not nice!I did like the intense rivalry between Storm and Calisto, there battles were real good, and amazing when storm fried her! - Jug was a good ad in to the brotherhood - I was upset that Xavier died, but they did it in a good way, and they clip after credits was shocking! - Colossus role was goo, because he didn't play a main character, and he shouldn't have had, since he isn't that known to marvel - Liked how they tricked Magneto, and took away his powers - Liked the battle between Iceman and Pyro and that Bobby finally got to the cool looking iceman, the one made of ice. -Liked how Storm stepped up and this movie and finally kicked ass and flew!!I am also skeptical about how those run-offs of wolverine and magneto will do, i don't think they will be that good, i think if they want to do another movie, make another xmen, number 4. And if they did, Mystique rogue and magneto should all have powers back and Xavier should be alive. It should be a battle against apocalypse, that should be the final Xmen movie",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A good action flick with less than stellar direction,"I had avoided seeing X-Men 3 for quite some time for the simple fact that I had heard it was a supreme disappointment compared to the second film of the series. I finally caved in and was pleasantly surprised that while it doesn't live up to the previous two films, it still stands on its own as a worthwhile part of the series.From an action point of view, there is plenty of. The action sequences are impressive to watch and the effects work is nothing short of fantastic. There was not a single effect that looked bad or looked like obvious CGI work -- which is a shortfall of even the best of films -- so in that regards it is quite impressive. There is a broadening of the ethical questions that the series poses, this film introducing the idea of a ""cure"" to mutancy and questioning whether there can be moral absolutes.My two biggest complaints are that of direction and the script itself. Brett Ratner has once again failed to show himself as an actor's director. Many scenes looked as if they were filmed simply for being parts of the script that he had to get out of the way in order to move onto the fun stuff. Unfortunately, this approach has the effect of making the actors' performances look stale, unimpressive and -- in some cases -- completely out of character for what has been established in the past. I would venture to guess that he could have drawn out (translation: directed) more honest and better performances from his cast than what he chose to put on screen. This has always been his downfall as a director, a trait he unfortunately brought to what had been to this point a well developed character piece for a comic book movie.The script itself had some very poor choices both in terms of logic and dialog. Some of the major action sequences prove to be very poorly thought out demanding more than a realistic level of suspension of disbelief. The entire finale rests upon moving the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco, yet does not actually take into consideration the reality of the situation in any way. By ignoring why the bridge sits on concrete bases, what is left is a view of the bridge sitting across the water as if its lower supports could float making for the scene to be rather ridiculous. Add to this some extremely poor dialog (most notable an example being Juggernaut's line to Kittie Pryde in the lab complex) and things could be better. And while the moral issues brought forward in this film are excellent, at the same time the writers failed to truly explore the issues more than a fleeting admission of their presence.However, not to make it seem like I didn't enjoy the film, I would say that X-Men 3 is a fun film to watch with many exciting and visually attractive elements. Don't go in expecting X-2 and you will not be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Not bad, just confusing as hell","The production of ""X3: The Last Stand"" was considered production hell. Let me break it down for you.Bryan Singer initially intended to shoot the film back-to-back with a fourth film, though he left in 2004 to direct ""Superman Returns"". Zak Penn and Simon Kinberg were hired the following month in 2004. Joss Whedon's ""Astonishing X-Men"" story called ""Gifted"", featuring a mutant cure was suggested for the primary story. Matthew Vaughn came on board as director in February 2005, but left due to the rushed production schedule and family issues.Other film directors included Joss Whedon, Rob Bowman, who directed the 2005 spin-off film to Daredevil, ELEKTRA, Alex Proyas, who directed ""I, Robot"" and Zack Snyder was also approached, but was already directing the 2006 film ""300"", but they all turned the offer down and eventually Brett Ratner was hired as directed, filming began in 2005 and the film was released in the summer movie season of 2006.In this sequel, a pharmaceutical company has developed a suppressor of the mutant gene, provoking controversy in the mutant community. Magneto declares war on the humans and retrieves his own weapon: Phoenix, who is the resurrected former X-Men leader, Jean Grey. A final battle between the X-Men and the Brotherhood ensues, and Wolverine must accept that in order to stop Grey, he will have to kill her.I don't mind a good amount of the story, but there are moments where I said, ""Okay, what the heck is really going on?"" and it is really amazing and stupid at the same time. The movie's plot is confusing in a few areas, but I love some of the plot. The acting is amazing and all of the main actors return with new members. Vinnie Jones plays Juggernaut and he does not even have a lot of screen time and the way they did his character is just sad. Eric Dane is good as Multiple Man in the screen time he has. Ellen Page as Kitty Pride / Shadowcat and she was really amazing for this part and she would play the part in ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"".Hugh Jackman does a good job as Wolverine and he is great. Famke Janssen as Jean Grey / Phoenix is really amazing and I felt that she should have won an Oscar for this film, but did not and that is just sad.The music by John Powell is really amazing and I think she does a really great job and it is the best musical score from him that I have heard, along with his musical score for Shrek and both Agent Cody Banks films.The visual effects and action scenes are really amazing in this film and my favorite action sequence is at the end, but when Wolverine killed Jean Grey, it almost had me crying first time I saw this film, but I love this film. The scene where Jean Grey / Phoenix kills Professor X really wanted me to cry, but I just felt emotion through the entire sequence.Overall, X-MEN: THE LAST STAND does a few things right, but it is just outweighed by flaws, but I would also say that I would be lying if I said that it was not enjoyable.6 out of 10.This is the first few X-MEN films and I will return to the X-MEN film series, soon with the other X-MEN films in the X-MEN film series.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Nay-sayers shut up.,"I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a long time. AND I'm a long time fan of the comic books.When you're turning 60 years of comic books into three two-hour movies, you can't stick steadfast to the events and relationships in the comics. You have to make the movies make sense within themselves. And they did.If you're only complaints about the movie are how they differ from they comic books, then I think you have nothing to complain about.If you look closer, they have a lot of connections to the comics under the surface. That crazy girl that has super-speed and can detect mutants who's in Magneto's brotherhood? When I first saw her, I was like that's a really random combination of powers. Then I realized that she's a combination of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, the siblings that were in Magneto's original Brotherhood of Evil Mutants in the comics.Yes, Juggernaut wasn't actually a mutant, he got his power from the stone, and yes, he was Prof. X's half-brother in the comics. SO WHAT?!?! If you let that ruin it so that you didn't crack up when he said ""I'm the Juggernaut, Bitch!"" then you shot yourself in the foot when you came into the movie.If you're still going into ANY movie adaptation of a piece of literature, whether it be novel, graphic novel, or comic book, and expecting it to stick to what you read, you are dumb.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Setup to X-Men 4 and 5,"While X-Men 3 is action-packed and has a decent (not great) story line, there is a serious lack of character development. Also, the movie leaves waaay too many unanswered questions as the director is so focused on 'carry-over' plot for X-Men 4 and/or 5. This is alarming because we all know what happens when movies get past the second-sequel... Furthermore, casting directors didn't do me any favors by adding Frasier to the mix. The good news is that the one-liners are gone and the FX are well done. All-in-all, it's a decent flick, but I should mention that X-men comic book fans will NOT be as satisfied as other movie-goers.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mutants At War,"Brett Ratner took over directing this third installment, which sees the same cast of mutants returning, as the humans reveal that they have discovered a cure for the mutants, which most reject as insulting, though this forces Magneto(Ian McKellen) to lead his growing Brotherhood of mutants into a war with the humans, and destroy the child-mutant from which this cure has been derived. New mutants include Shadow Cat(played by Ellen Page), along with Juggernaut, Colossus, and Angel, among several others. After Mystique is accidentally cured, then betrayed by Magneto, she helps the humans learn about the plan, thus forcing a climatic battle, where a resurrected Jean Grey(Famke Janssen) must battle forces led by Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) and Beast(played by Kelsey Grammar). Audacious sequel provides surprising fates for Cyclops(James Marsden) & Professor Xavier(Patrick Stewart) that ups the stakes considerably. Much debated film is hated by some, but I found it an exciting and well-made entry just as good as the first two.Be sure to stay with it through the end credits though...Quite a surprise!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The movie suffered, however, from some cheesy dialogue, the introduction of several new mutants, without any development, or much screen time at all (For instance, although Angel was the whole reason the 'cure' was ever developed, and you'd think he'd then play an important part in the movie...he was barely there, and when he WAS on screen, I think they just wanted to impress everyone with his 'wingspan'...which made me laugh innapropriately the first time), an absolutely ATROCIOUS score (I wished several times throughout the movie that I were deaf), etc etc. While the previous two X-men films displayed a balance of story/character development and action, the story/characters in this one were weak...and the movie was only redeemed by the incredible action sequences during the last half of the film...I'd rate those sequences alone an 8 or 9, but the rest of the movie a 5 or 6, or less.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining? Yes. Flawed? Oh yes.,"First of all I'm not a comic fanboy, just a faithful follower of the movie series. I remember when we first saw Toad and his wicked tongue, when there was that huge mystery of Wolverine's background and when we first saw Magneto working his magic. Therefore my disappointment comes from feeling a little cheated after six years and three films.Singer basically kick-started the comic book film again with X-Men and it was mature, intriguing and funny. Then, X2 capitalised on the plot threads with great enthusiasm. Now, it's up to Brett Ratner...As another reviewer mentioned, you can only criticize Ratner so much. His directorial style is rather bland, for sure, but with a decent script, they can be elevated. Rush Hour was funny, Red Dragon was based on a decent story to being with. X3, however, has some truly awful dialogue and it's handling of popular (even certain unpopular) characters is disgusting.The so-called ""plot"" involves a so-called ""cure"" this time. However, this plot device is thrown away by the end, suggesting that the cure doesn;t even work. So apart from certain deaths, the situation of many mutants seems to return to normal which only proves this is not the last stand were promised and certainly not the epic showdown we expected.There are some juicy set-pieces, I'll tell you now. Once again, they all involve Magneto and his amazing powers which allow his to ""fly"" the Golden Gate bridge to Alcatraz and crush an entire motorcade effortlessly. The action sequences, or fight scenes, are less coherent and the fact that there are only a few X-Men involved at the final battle emphasises that this is not the film it should have been. Characters are killed or rendered useless, otherwise they are simply shoved to the side, to allow for the new generation of anonymous characters to show off. It angers me to see how veteran X-Men are written out-of-character and discarded so easily.So should you see X3? Yes, for the usual mutant shenanigans, but no for seeing you favourite characters become shadows of their former selves.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A mutant child is the prize,"The premise of this final episode of the X-Men featuring Charles Xavier, Scott Sommers and Jean Grey is that a pharmaceutical company has developed a vaccine that will ""cure"" mutants of their powers. For a few of them, it is a godsend, but for the vast majority, it is a cure for what should not be considered a disease.
As is usually the case, Magneto takes the side of opposition and he attracts many mutants to his side. He considers it a war against Homo Sapiens and the X-Men and Xavier stand in opposition. Compounding everything is the return of Jean Grey, now more the Phoenix than the Marvel Girl. There are some initial skirmishes, but it comes down to a titanic battle between the forces of Magneto against a unit of U. S. soldiers and a few of the X-Men.
The special effects are of course tremendous, for without them no modern superhero movie could be even close to entertaining. There are some casualties, but the ending hints that we may have not seen the last of Magneto.

It feels rushed. If the director was given the ""go ahead"" from Hollywood to make the movie at just 120 minutes, I think that it would fair way better with critics and fans.

director benchmarking,"There are very few occasions for us viewers to compare different movie directors' talents. X men: The last stand is one of those. Benchmarking is a slightly geeky practice that consists of running the same program on different computers to evaluate and compare their performance. In this case, the program deals with X men fighting ordinary human beings that are trying to exploit a new kind of substance taken out of a particular X man. (In the previous installment the drug allowed for total control over an X man who received it, this time the drug apparently eliminates X powers). The computers we're comparing are Bryan Singer and Brett Ratner. This new movie reflects Brett Ratner's basically larger-than-life, hyper-muscled, thick-minded way to direct movies. You get a gazillion different characters (each of them expressing themselves for er...5 milliseconds) doing a gazillion very scenic but ultimately meaningless things (I'm especially referring to the way Magneto gets to the Alcatraz research center). What made the X men movies a bit different from the other superhero movies was the everlasting mind games about being different from the rest (which director Singer was really good at showing in a very discreet but effective way). Now it's all a super power show-off. This is not a bad movie. But! It could have been so much better.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"If your not a fan already, steer clear.","I don't read the comics, I've only seen the first X-Men film, and I waltzed into my local theatre this afternoon with a very good friend of mine, having nothing better to do. My expectations of this film were consequently not high, my demand only for some light entertainment, something to pass the time. Oh dear.Credit to the actors, there were moments of tension and drama in this film despite an appalling script. My heart goes out to whoever played the president of the United States (again Hollywood plays it safe by casting a generic old guy in this role) who had to hold a straight face when introducing the latest American ambassador to the U.N. as a 7 foot hairy blue thing, and whilst delivering lines such as ""then God help us"". Another cringe-worthy moment was Hugh Jackman's admirable attempt at yet ANOTHER repeated two-word sentence, in this case; ""It's over....it's over..."". Poor Hugh. Who on earth talks like this in real life, and why does Hollywood continue to inflict this kind of plastic text upon its actors?Script aside, if you're not a member of what seems to be a near fanatical X-men cult following, you wont get this movie. OK, so perhaps its not a movie that you're supposed to ""get"", after all, one could argue the prospect of mutants being able to manipulate their own bodies and the elements around them to be too fantastical to be worthy of criticism, but for an outsider, unfamiliar to the X-men world, it all seems utterly ridiculous. I can handle the powers, the struggle of responsibility that goes with them, yadda yadda yadda, but why oh why must these powers accompany a daft hair-cut? A stupid costume? Why does Magneto, one of the most powerful beings in the universe and capable of moving the entire Golden Gate bridge with a flick of his wrist, feel the need to wear a plastic helmet that makes him look like the end of a man's penis? Wolverine has an EXOSCELETON MADE OF TITANIUM, but every morning gels his hair into two cute little wolf ears to make himself look that bit more gruffer. Though this may be a criticism of the concept of X-men itself, the film takes itself so seriously that one cannot help but point the finger and laugh.To the inexperienced eye, this is how the beginning of the film is interpreted (SOME SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW). Some guy wearing sunglasses goes to a lake where he mourns over his dead girlfriend, he goes mental for some unknown reason, shoots the lake with his eye lasers and she appears, unharmed. She kisses him. WE NEVER SEE HIM AGAIN. His death is utterly unexplained and we get the feeling the actor realised how big a career mistake he was making and deciding to pack it all in halfway through filming. The girlfriend is found unconscious and her mysterious reappearance is explained with remarkable speed in a singular sentence of jargon from a pained Patrick Stewart. She wakes up, and is inexplicably powerful and evil. The subsequent ""war"" that follows is confined to one singular showdown: a pub brawl in the car park of Alcatraz Island.And there you have it ladies and gentlemen, Hollywood whores itself to a special FX fest once again. Save yourself a trip to the theatre folks. This is a film that had a sickeningly large budget. I shudder to think what better things could have been done with this money. Instead it was wasted upon a film that is in every aspect, below average.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Definitely the best of the three!,"I didn't think it could be done but Brett Ratner has made X3 even better than X2 - which says a lot! (I gave X2 9/10)The characters are more like we remember from the comics. Storm flies and messes with the weather a lot more. Wolverine goes Berzerk three times and gets thrown by Colossus twice. There is a Danger Room sequence. We have a lot more mutants. etc. etc etc.At the same time, while it was not a problem for me at all, I can see how perhaps some fans might dislike certain aspects. For example: Storm does have a lot of ""street talk"" rather than her African Goddess style from the comics. Wolverine is very much a part of the team and even acts a bit in a teacher or team leader role at times. Angel and Cyclops are hardly in it. But all of these choices were for the better of the film in my opinion.Some of what made this film really great: 1) Phoenix is incredible! Amazing! Perfect! Absolutely brilliant! And fortunately the whole story really revolves around her, so she gets plenty of screen time. 2) Beast is spot on how most fans will remember him from the comics. 3) The mutants in general are more like the ones from the comics. 4) Juggernaught is cool! I never really liked him from the comics but Vinnie Jones really made the character. 5) Angel's story was very well told in a concise way. 6) Iceman finally gets to be Iceman.There are lots of new mutants and the three or four that we get to know a bit are well fleshed out considering the amount if screen time they get. Plus they have cool powers! The whole Brotherhood (Magneto's team) is very cool!But the thing that makes this film truly great and the best of the series is the story! And we are treated to some astonishing surprises! You will never ever guess to the fate of some of the main characters. Some die, some lose their powers. And believe me it will surprise you.There is so much left in the X-Men series that can be told. This movie alone opens about three possible future story lines.I hope that there will be more X-Men movies, and I hope Brett stays on as director.If you liked the first two you will LOVE this! :)10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Singlehandedly Ruined the X-Men Franchise,"It is excruciatingly clear that Ratner had never read an X-Men comic before directing this movie.There were so many inconsistencies and inaccuracies with this movie when comparing it with the comic book source material that, even as a lifelong X-Men fan, I can never bring myself to watch this movie a second time. I am shocked that Marvel Entertainment, Inc. or Marvel Studios allowed this movie to be made and distributed in the form it was delivered to the public.After this abysmal interpretation was released, I found myself unable to wait for a reboot of this once proud Marvel franchise.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What Choice Do We Have?,"I guess I wasn't expecting to see so many changes. While I did enjoy gist of the plot, the shock factor of what was going on internally with my favorite gang of Mutants took away a lot from the movie for me.I don't want to say too much if you haven't seen it already and as far as movies go, it was enjoyable but nothing close to X-Men 1 or 2. The action wasn't as intense or thrilling and I just didn't like all the new plot twist directly involving the internal structure of the crew. (Once you see the movie, you'll know what I mean).On a more upbeat note, I thought Kelsey Grammar's character, Hank McCoy was a welcomed addition (in fact, he should have been around in 1 and 2 if you ask me) and I wished there had been more interaction between him and Wolverine.Magneto was his usual mean self, living up to his bad guy antics.On a whole I'd have to say if you are a X-Men fan you've got to go see this one just on g.p.

"Sure, a good action movie but..","Marvel-freak as I am, I might not be the best one commenting on this picture since I'm already too involved in the comic book in order to produce an objective image of the film.Anyway, compared to the first and especially the second movie, this one doesn't get through to you in the same way. The second movie is by far the best one and maybe they should have been satisfied with that. Here it's pretty much the same way as in Matrix 2 & 3, it just continues where the last movie finished without adding the essential ""extra"" which makes it unforgettable.Not much more character-building, which i necessary when making a sequel, but pretty good photo and good action makes up for a bit of those losses.

"X 3 left many things undone there is gotta be X 4, fans need an explanation",i have already watch X men 3 and it was great however the show left many people confused IT left many things uncleared i feel i couldn't just end the whole X men series just like that its like raising a child and abandoned it at an age of 3 the movie left many things unexplained for example Professor Xavier mind shifting and did cyclops and jean really died? Many said the cure was only temporary and i believe it was definitely true and the real villains haven been appeared yet! for example the sinister and spocalypse... the 1st 3 movies is about confrontation and mutant rights X men in comics have made their marks of superheros so they haven got a chance to display their superhero acts... X men is a forever thing you cant just make it history and Hollywood shouldn't have the tradition of stopping at 3rd movie there is still a lot more that the 3 movies didn't cover i hope this will be the end of a trilogy and the start of the new one i know wolvernine and magneto movie are already in the planning i really hope fox and marvel will start discussing on X men 4! X men must indeed continue! as what marvel said the characters wasn't dead at all..... I WOULD LOVE A X 4 A BETTER X MEN MOVIE that will be a hit!,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-3: The Last Stand is the greatest Sci fie/comic book movie made to date,"I have no idea why people are getting all upset and angry abut this movie. First off it is not like the critics gave it 1 out of 5 stars. On average it got 3 or 3.5 out of 5 stars. You shouldn't base your option on whether to see this off of some guy who thinks it is a bad movie. Honestly this is the best X-men movie yet made. The acting is great, the effects are great, and the action and fighting is awesome. It is a magnificent way to end the series. And not only that, it adds surprises and shocking scenes. A couple of mutants die that you would not expect to die. This film has a darker more evil look to it then did the other to. With the edition of some new mutants, and the ones who now become a huge part of the series really helps. Brett Ranter takes some x-men from the other movies and gives them a big part, showing more of them. They play a huge part.But not only doest his movie defy what critics have to say, it proves them wrong. It brought in over 120 million here in the US. WOW!! This has the most fighting of the three, with the final fight being a group fight instead of a one on one fight. The fight is about 20 minutes long. Not only that the writers added in some funny lines. Overall this deserves a 10/10. Best sci-fie movie to date.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I give it a B for special effects,"Surprisingly, Halle Berry isn't the biggest waste of screen time in X3. She actually does a decent job! The biggest waste of screen time are the cheap one-liners and gimmicks the director used to try to be funny. You can tell he thought of Rush Hour the entire time - cheap, throwaway lines are OK if it's a comedy, but this movie was too dark and serious for that. Similarly, the use of clothing to denote who was a villain and who wasn't was ridiculous. The members of Magneto's newly formed Brotherhood all wear silly fishnets and bustiers - apparently after defeating humans they were all going to an S&M party. There were bright moments. As I said, Halle Berry's performance wasn't terrible. A first! The special effects were great and the script was actually very good. The problems came when Ratner decided to flex his directorial muscle and made small decisions that didn't ruin the story, but didn't help. It's a good story and a decent end to the trilogy, but there were little areas here and there that should have been fleshed out and developed more.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Weakest of the three but better than Fantastic Four,"If you loved the first two X-Men films, you will not like this one. I walked into the theater not expecting much, knowing a new director had taken over. And I still walked out a little disappointed. I don't understand the high marks this film got. The special effects were great for sure but there was something missing. A story? A good script? Character development maybe? Anyway, with all the amazing special effects and a short running time, I still felt the movie dragged. There wasn't much suspense or mystery or emotional attachment to the characters, except to the ones that already had been developed in the previous films. There wasn't much reason for me to continue watching. Nothing new was added. When the film ended-- and it ended abruptly-- I was left with an empty feeling and wanted to say ""what the...?"" And what happened to the film score? It's non-existent! Too bad the series had to end this way. But at least we still have the first two films to enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Take a Stand,"When a cure is found that could turn mutants back to ""normal,"" the reactions seem polar. Some, like Magneto, deeply oppose to it, while others, like Rogue, want the cure as soon as possible. As a war is brewing between the mutants and the humans, can the X-Men stop Magneto and his destruction?Let me start off to say this: The plot for the film is really great. Honestly, I think it's the best out of the trilogy, seeing how it's very political and it offers much more than usual superhero movies. One can even make up a metaphor, and, probably, there is a social commentary being said here. I really appreciated that. However, this was a disappointing film.After what has been set up in the excellent part two in the trilogy, it wasn't not hard to see that this one would fall short, like many threequals. The running time is so short that not even many of the new characters are on screen long enough, let alone many major characters left in the dust. Also, although the story is excellent, the execution is mediocre, replacing character development from the last two chapters and replacing it with more explosions and action scenes, which, I must admit, are quite amazing.You might even find yourself amazed at how many major characters are being killed off, possibly just for the sake of trying to limit down the millions of characters on screen already. Even characters like Mystique, Rogue, and Cyclops, major characters in the last two films, can be missed if you blink once on the screen. Saying that, the film manages to do well with cramming millions of things in one short film. The story may be a little fast paced, and maybe there's no time to stop and feel for characters being killed off, but it's good enough for what it has.As said earlier, the action sequences are amazing. The special effects are flawless. I even liked the new characters on board, like Ellen Page, Vinnie Jones, and Ben Foster. The original cast also do well here, Hugh Jackman with his tough attitude and Halle Berry with a new hairdo. Overall, it's not the sequel one might hope for, especially if it's the end of a trilogy, but it's good enough for what it is: An entertaining, fast paced romp. Let's just hope they make another sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pass the Popcorn! review,"After the first X-Men movie and X2, the things were looking really good for the X-Men franchise, and then along came X-Men: The Last Stand. This drastic change in quality between movies is mostly attributed to Bryan Singer, the director of the first two movies, deciding to direct Superman Returns instead of this one, and being replaced by Brett Ratner. Since then, Bryan Singer has officially stated he regrets his decision. Considering how Superman Returns isn't a much better movie than X-Men: The Last Stand, it's a shame things went this way. Instead of a satisfying third X-Men movie, the world got a X-Men movie that felt like it was directed by Michael Bay.There are two main plot lines in X-Men: The Last Stand. The first one is about a cure for mutations that changes mutants to humans. The mutant community is divided by this cure – some of them want to change to humans, while the others strictly oppose this cure and want to destroy it by all means. At the same time, the X-men discover that Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) isn't dead, but Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) warns them she maybe isn't the same old Jean Grey they used to know. This turns out to be true when Jean Grey's alter ego, Phoenix, takes control of her body.While the first two X-Men movies are classics of the superhero genre, X-Men: The Last Stand is simply a very bad movie. It had almost twice the amount of its predecessor's budget ($210 million) and it still seemed like a cheaper movie. The special effects are bad, but so is everything else. The dialogue is worse than ever, the plot is uninteresting, and the freshly introduced mutants are awful. The X-Men franchise is mainly about its characters – misunderstood individuals feared by the general public – and their moral dilemmas; the strong characters and character developments are the main things that made the first two movies so good. Both of those aspects are lacking in X-Men: The Last Stand. New characters like Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) and Angel (Ben Foster) are one-dimensional and forgettable caricatures, and the character of Dr. Henry 'Hank' McCoy aka Beast (Kelsey Grammar), while somewhat interesting, was a only of shadow of what he could have been.If you can get past the ludicrous writing, the silly acting and the simple characters, and just want to see mindless action scenes and mutants beating each other up, than X-Men: The Last Stand could just be the movie for you. However, if you strive to watch something above the generic Michael Bay tropes, you should definitely stay away from this movie. While there is some charm to dumb popcorn action movies, X-Men: The Last Stand is still an insult to the whole franchise, and doesn't deserve to have the words 'X-Men' in its title. Unfortunately, things for the X-Men franchise didn't get much better with X-Men Origins: The Wolverine.Rating: 6/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best out of the Trilogy,"The Last Stand greatly surpasses the other two movies, which is saying something. I had to wait 2 hours in line to see the movie before it comes out on Friday, but it was very worth it. The movie wastes no time getting right into the plot. You stay on the edge of you seat the entire movie! You will laugh, cry and maybe even jump from fright! Several characters were never introduced, including Gambit. And Nightcrawler is no where to be seen. The only thing that I didn't like about the movie was that it kinda had a ""This happened and don't worry about how."" I think that they should have added about 30 minutes onto the movie to make it more in depth but I understand that that would have cost a lot of money.The movie has a very exciting plot that will make you hold your breath until the very end. This isn't a spoiler but if you want to make the movie even better stay after the credits...I promise it will have you screaming for more!",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
simply awesome,"This movie had enough for everyone, minor plot points and technical tit-for-tat of what is true to the comics did very little to waver this juggernaut of a movie. The sounds are louder, the mutant powers more extreme, and of course the stakes have been raised dramatically. The movie was so jammed packed that it felt more like a large inhalation rather than an epic movie. The one hour and forty minutes go by without even being noticed.It is true that storm has a larger role, in addition to this, wolverine's ability seems to get elevated to immortal status. Of course this is fine with me because I like both of the characters.Other than that, Go and see for yourself, it really is one heck of a beginning for this summer's movie calendar.

Kellsey Grammar was perfect to play Beast and Vinne Jones as Juggernaut was just awesome. I even laughed at some particular parts. However i wasn't happy with some parts of the movie and i hope that Brett Ratter DOESN'T direct another Marvel Film.

Weakest of the series!,"A new ""Cure"" has been invented by scientists made by a mutant boy with powers to take away others's powers, Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is shocked about the announcement of an anti-mutant cure as he seeks for a peaceful solution to the whole problem as some mutants love the idea while others are offended by it. Magneto (Ian Mckellen) is upset about the idea the most as he wants to lead a revolution that can destroy the human race and Cyclops (James Marsden) still feels bad about losing Jean Grey (Famnke Janssen) as now she's reborn as someone different known as The Phoenix with superior powers to her original and seems to have a dark destructive side. Rogue (Anna Paquin) just can't stand being so dangerous around everyone she touches as she wants the cure to be normal so she can kiss a man, it's up to the fellow X-Men Storm (Halle Berry), new member Beast (Kelsey Grammar), and Wolverine (Huge Jackman) to head to where the cure is and try to stop Magneto's war.Very weak finale of the series! the story is very interesting and complex including the concept of how a cure can change the life of a different person. Bryan Singer has been replaced by Brett Ratner as director who made the first two excellent ""Rush Hour"" movies didn't do such a bad job as some fans proclaim. The film does offer yet another batch of mutants such as Juggernaut (Vinnie Jones) even though in the comics he's not really a mutant but was given magic powers, Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) and Angel (Ben Foster) but the problem with the film is that the humor isn't as funny as the ones in the excellent first two movies and the film feels very rushed to be an ending of the series.It's fun but nowhere as excellent as the first two.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

X3 tops all Comic Book movies,"I admit that I am an X-Men comic book enthusiast, but that didn't guarantee that I would love or even like X-Men 3. Nor did being an X-Men enthusiast mean that I would be overly picky regarding every minute fact and detail regarding ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" thereby making me dislike it.That being said, there were three conditions that needed to be satisfied for me to like ""The Last Stand"", and four conditions in order for me to love ""The Last Stand"".1.) A good story.X-Men delivered on having a good story by having intriguing underlying stories accompany the main story.2.) New characters.Being that X-Men has been around for over 40 years there have been many characters that have been introduced in the popular comic book. Some of the characters are forgettable and others are unforgettable. X3 introduced enough new characters to make sure they would not fall short of showing some of the unforgettable characters.3.) Display of the abilities of the new characters and/or the untapped or unused abilities of the old characters.I'll just say check. There were some very cool and interesting characters introduced and we got to see their abilities. AND we also got to see some untapped abilities of the old characters.4.) An epic battle.X3 delivered the epic battle. It could even be said that there were two epic battles which is one more than any X-Men fan or non-X-Men fan could hope for.This movie delivered more than I anticipated and I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Average in so many ways,"OK, I saw this movie today in the cinema and it was just plain poor. But I'll begin with the positives.Visually, it was great. Some amazing CGI in there and it just looked fantastic.And now on to the negatives. First of all, the dialog is Appalling. Some absolutely shocking lines in there that bordered on humorous. They should have the script-writer fired and to be told to give up as the lines that were supposed to be epic and dramatic were just plain clichéd at best.The storyline is ridiculous, again, it's as if they put as little thought into the storyline as they did the dialog. It is apparent that both ""baddies"" and ""goodies"" were fighting for the same thing, but of course the ""baddies"" were doing it for all the wrong reasons.The cast was filled with good actors fully capable of the roles they were put into, yet the poorness of the movie made there characters kind of boring and lifeless.However, I will say this, X-Men fans will probably love it. It captures all the magic of comic books and I suppose it does make for a decent sequel if you liked the first two. I just personally think it not only DIDN'T match up to various other superhero movies, but it also didn't live up to its own potential.Just average.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
X-Men: The Last Straw,"This movie was, to put it bluntly, awful. I knew going in that Ratner was a poor director, and my expectations were accordingly low, but I generally enjoy comic book adaptations, even the mediocre ones, so I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Too bad. The movie was worse than I had feared. It's a boring, silly movie, with any hint of the style and humanity with which Singer had imbued the series gone. Scenes that should have been powerful and affecting in the hands of a director with even the least bit of class and a modicum of talent are instead laughable -- literally. The audience was laughing in what should have been key dramatic moments. In this movie, there doesn't seem to be a reason for anything: Things happen for no reason. Characters do things for no reason -- or, worse, for no reason other than to set up some kewl special effect that's generally boring given its ridiculous context. Characters -- some of them important -- are discarded with no exploration of the consequences; other characters are added, mostly for no reason other than to throw them on the screen for a few moments. The ""bad guys"" in this film are the ones who are fighting the right fight this time around, albeit in a thoroughly stupid manner; the ""good guys"" act at best like morons and make decisions that make me question why I'm supposed to be rooting for their team. Dark Willow steps out of ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and into the X-Men universe without the benefit of Whedon's punchy dialogue and humanity -- the dialogue here is so cliché-ridden that the people around me, who had not seen the movie before, were delivering lines before the movie characters and getting them word-perfect. There's no character development in this movie (though there are, to be fair, several amusing moments, mostly involving Wolverine) -- just a lot of 'splosions and effects. But as George Lucas once said and seems to have forgotten, ""a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing."" Sure, on a basic level lots of water floating around and explosions and bad weather and things disintegrating look fairly cool, but without any reason to care, what's the point? Even the fight scenes were mostly unsatisfactory, with characters zipping around and the camera snapping from angle to angle and character to character so frantically, so gracelessly, that it's nigh impossible to take any pleasure from watching it. This movie is an awful mess and an astounding disappointment, even given my low expectations. It's terrible from first to last. As far as sequels go, this one's down there with Highlander 2. To be avoided.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Movie,"X-men 3 outstripped X-men and X-2 by a long shot. It put in a bit of history yes; but stuff we hadn't seen before. It was wonderful not to have to sit through things we had seen before and get right into the story. I liked that Storm was given more time and depth, as she wasn't seen very much in the first two and she's always been my favorite character. The humor was great, the special effects were incredible and the acting was pretty good. Ian McKellan is awesome as usual and so was Patrick Stewart. The younger actors have improved as well. I would have liked to have seen more of Mystique; but it introduced more villains in this one including Juggernaut and Mulitple Man. The only problem I had with the movie was a character, Marrow. Marrow was portrayed as a man and Marrow in the comic books and everything else is a woman. That was a little irritating; but I digress. I really recommend this to everyone. Even if you didn't like the first two, you may like this one.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I want more,"I recently saw X-men, and I was very happy with the movie but a little disappointed. Being an X-men lover, it got my excitement up just seeing a new character being added to the cast. There is a lot of that in this movie, but with a running time at 1 hour 44 minutes, another 40 minutes of run time would have given a lot more to the climax and time to introduce/tell the story of the *new* mutants. But don't get me wrong, this movie is still fantastic. Its got sadness, romance, and a hell of some action scenes, plus its X-men so it'd be cool even if the movie was horrible.

"Instead of fresh life, we get Hollywood retread in the 3rd X-men","So with Singer gone on to Superman, Brett Ratner of Rush Hour (!?!) gets the nod to direct the third installment of the awesome X-men franchise. In my opinion (on a 10 point scale) the first was about 6.5, the second almost an 8 and this a 6. I'm really over Halle Berry, and her need for Storm to have a bigger role didn't help the movie in the slightest. The mythology and character introduction is good, but the story was a little simple. A cure has been developed, Magneto decides to destroy it and a few of the good guys go and help save the day and prevent a few lives. I found the sub-plot of the Phoenix much more interesting and wish more time had been spent on this story. The fight at the end didn't offer much out of the ordinary apart from Juggernaut trying to get the mutant cure.This movie is like day old lemon pound cake. It was great, now it is still good. It might be something you look forward to, but once you get it, it's past its prime. The crumb is dry which negates some of the flavor and sweetness of the cake.
