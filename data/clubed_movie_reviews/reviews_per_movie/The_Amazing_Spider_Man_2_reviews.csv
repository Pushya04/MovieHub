The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"8/10 - I know I am definitely in the minority on this one, but I for one feel that this 2014 sequel is not only not the ""worst Spider-Man movie,"" but actually improves on its predecessor by doubling down on heart, the swoon-worthy chemistry between Garfield and Stone, and jaw-dropping visual effects.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Why the hate?,"I don't get the hate for this movie. Was it the ending? the death scene? green goblin?
TASM1 I can understand that one was bland.Fans just love to nitpick and don't know what they want.Its a sad, fun movie all the way. Like all spiderman movies , shows, comics. Peter is trying to figure stuff out while nothing goes right. He fights crime, gets a big baddy and wins.Same thing happened in this movie, but for a price.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Better, bigger, more ambitious and emotionally heavier","As the story unfolds, and all conspiracies behind Oscorp unwind, the life of our lovable web-swinger gets more adrenaline full and also more complicated. There is a bit of a sense of DeJa Vu, specially when Peter Parker is trying to balance his personal life and his super hero life. But the aspect in which this movie really shines (like his ancestor) is in the characters, however this time the emotional weight is much more present,and the scale of both the drama and action is much bigger. Andrew and Emma were just as great as in the previous movie, and the chemistry between them is fantastic. Jaime Fox also nailed it as Electro, even thou the character itself was not the best written character, but his performance was so great that i was able to overcome the writing. Dane DeHann was equally great as the Green Goblin, at first i didn't like the idea of Harry being the Green Goblin instead of Norman Osborn, but it was a good choice and it matched perfectly with the plot and tone of the movie.(Also Dane has a knack for playing psychopaths) As to be expected there are plenty CGI scenes but it really didn't bother me because the action sequences were done in a very creative way. The Score, composed by Hans Zimmer,is amazing and somewhat contemporary, so it fits the themes of each character and moment. Overall the movie was much more intense and heavier than the first installment, as our main character deals not only with supernatural challenges but also emotional dilemmas.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best version of Spiderman till date...,"The original trilogy seemed incomplete but now, that incompleteness is completed by this new one. I love the background story of Spiderman shown in this movie, at least it has got one unlike the original. The story of how Peter Parker ended up with his Uncle and Aunt, the story of why ""Peter Parker"" is the only one who could be Spiderman and no-one else. It all feels complete now. A satisfactory plot for a superhero movie.Talking about the performances, I like the new Peter Parker, humorous and entertainer. I've started to feel the original 'Peter Parker' was actually boring. Really good job by the actors here. And with that SuperVillian : 'Electro', the movie becomes one of the best SuperHero movies. Visual effects are quite good and the movie is perfectly entertaining. For me, this is the best version of Spiderman movie till now. I don't care what the critics have to say, this movie is a good one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spider-Man more on his plate than he can handle in this sequel,"I'm an unabashed die hard fan boy for Spider-Man. There I said it. You can call me a homer for anything Spider-Man. I wasn't a happy camper when I heard they were rebooting the films that I fell in love with. The first two Raimi films for me were great. The sequel still holding up today as one of the best superhero movies of all time. The first Amazing Spider-Man was a bit jarring for me. I walked out of the film not knowing what I thought about it. I enjoyed Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man but his Peter Parker didn't click with me. I also had some nit picky things about the film as a whole (Gwen instead of Mary Jane, lackluster villain). But watching the film a few more times I realized that I liked it.I do research on films that I'm excited for. This film came out weeks earlier in the UK and Europe. And the reviews were mixed which was sinking my high hopes. I didn't like the fact that there were three villains (More on that later). But it seemed like they were choosing the right actors for parts and surrounding the film in talent. After much heart and headache reading people thoughts and reviews for me, I'm okay with saying I liked much of this second Spider-Man film.Andrew Garfield is Spider-Man and it seems he's embraced the part much more this time than in the first film. His Spider-Man is having fun being the savior of the city. He's making the quips, the jokes and the all around energy of his Spider-Man feels directly out of the comic book. I am finally sold on his Peter Parker. Director Marc Webb finally lets the smart but dorky Parker shine in a few scenes that are hilarious and engaging.I'm still not an Emma Stone fan but she is a good counter to Garfield's Parker. They have excellent chemistry. You can tell that these may be Webb's favorite scenes to shoot. When they are on screen this huge summer tent pole film because a small drama about two people with a unique love story.The villains, there are three of them but not really. Let me explain. Rhino played basically as a cameo by Paul Giamatti is really only on screen to show Spider-Man in action at the beginning and end of the film. His main adversaries are Jamie Foxx's Electro who starts off as a man who is saved by Spider-Man. He then becomes a obsessed fan only to in perfect comic book fashion have a horrible accident that grants him superpowers. Foxx is okay, I wouldn't say he is awful. He has some good moments and contrary to what has been written I think he only has one cringe worthy line.Dane DeHaan is one of if not my favorite actor working this moment. His method style works so well in many of the films he's in and here it's perfect. His Harry Osborn is less cartoon-y than James Franco's from previous films. He's creepy, spoiled, arrogant but dealt with a lot of adversity. His chemistry with Garfield feels genuine. It doesn't feel forced like it could have been. They are long time friends who have been distant but because of new circumstances are forced back together.The action is fun, fast and so Spider-Man if that means anything. The way they use his spider sense was very cool. I want to see more of that. The small nods to the comic book are fantastic. There are nods here and there to the upcoming sinister six film which doesn't cloud the film. It's just there in the story that this is apart of a large story in the future. I was trying to count the nods to the comic books. The only issues I had with the film was Peter's search for what happen to his father was kind of just there to fill time. Also the great Sally Field as Aunt May got only a few scenes. She was great on screen but mostly wasted.Because this film is dividing fans I think I've pinpointed the problem. I'm a fan of the comic books and this film feel like a few issues of the comic books aka a mini-series. There are multiple stories, with multiple villains and a lot going on. I'm okay with the finally product and eager to see the film again. For Garfield's performance, the chemistry with Stone and the action scenes this film is a fun ride for any fan of the neighborhood web shooter.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Finally!,"This film is getting too much hate by some people and too much love by others (including me), and it seems to be only based on the mental image each group has of spider-man and movie scripts in general.Those who love the soup opera aspects of Peter Park, hated, they missed the character grow, the motives of the villains (arguable) and complained for having too many story lines. On the other hand those who love comic spidey, loved, for all the stupid puns, the charisma and the of course the action. But the main complain is about the script, but understanding as a comic adaptation, it makes sense, the several sub-plots going on between each fight,the preface and Peter Parker/Spider-Man parallels objectives, it makes just like a regular comic (weekly or monthly) and less like a regular movie.But What can I say, I was expecting to see the real (mental image, again) Spider-Man on screen, the costume is really (a lot of emphasis here) beautiful, Andrew Garfield really is in the character, Emma Stone makes an active love interest, Dane DeHaan makes a 'realistic' Green Goblin and Paul Giamatti goes a over-the-top, more related to an usual Spider-Man Villain. The only big flaw is Jamie Foxx getting the spotlight just because Django, the character is lost in the movie, half-way between fun villain and real threat, shame because he is the main villain.Marc Webb got me, I'm gonna be the first in line for: The Amazing Spider-Man 3, Venom-Carnage, Sinister Six, maybe Spider-Woman (not confirmed yet), or any other release of a fun comic adaptation.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Let's go catch a spider.""","""Let's go catch a spider.""Marc Webb's first feature film, 500 Days of Summer, was a successful small indie romantic film with a lot of heart. He went from that to the huge production of the Spider-Man franchise which I thought didn't necessarily need a reboot so soon. However the film did work thanks to Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Peter Parker. His natural charisma and confidence translated really well to the character and his sense of humor makes him the perfect candidate to play Spier-Man. I began my review by mentioning that Webb directed 500 Days of Summer because for me the heart and soul of this film is the love story between Gwen and Peter. I can't think of any other superhero film with such a great love story and believable chemistry than this one. Garfield and Emma Stone are incredible together and I loved their scenes. Webb knows a thing or two about young romance and it is the film's strongest asset. The sequel is entertaining and has some great action scenes, but I could've watched this film for the romance alone. The flaws are actually the villains in this film. They don't crowd the film like the trailers led me to believe, but they really don't seem to menacing until we reach the final third act. For a film that runs at 140 minutes it went by really quick and that is always a good sign. Spider-Man 2 might not be as good as this year's Captain America, but it does have its solid moments and clever one-liners. At times the CGI took me out of the film as it looked more like a video game, but there were some interesting shots as we got to follow Spider-Man swing across the New York City landscape. The film works better as a romantic comedy than an actual superhero movie but that was fine with me because it was a really good one. It makes most other recent rom-coms look ridiculous and unbelievable.After a short flashback where we see what happened with Peter's parents, the camera follows Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield) swinging across NYC as he tries to stop a Russian mob criminal, Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti), who has stolen something from OsCorp. In the midst of all the action he receives a call from his girlfriend, Gwen (Emma Stone), who is reminding him that he's going to be late for their graduation. Somehow Spider-Man manages to take care of business and arrives in the nick of time to receive his degree as Peter Parker. His Aunt May (Sally Field) is the only family he has left, but she's there for him like she's always been. Peter however has been having visions of Gwen's father reminding him of the promise he made to not date his daughter in order to keep her out of danger. Apparently it has been a conflict they've dealt with over the last few months and Gwen decides it's time for the two to break up. Gwen continues to work at OsCorp which is now managed by Norman's son, Harry (Dane DeHaan), after his passing. Harry seems to suffer from the same degenerative disease of his father and wants to continue researching for a cure in OsCorp. Peter is glad to see his childhood friend back, but when he realizes what he's up to things get complicated. When an employee from OsCorp suffers a freak accident he becomes Electro (Jamie Foxx), a dangerous foe for Spider-Man and the city.The Amazing Spider-Man has some flaws but it still entertains thanks to the great chemistry between Stone and Garfield. They are perfect together. DeHaan is also great as Harry and he does look like a believable threat for Spider-Man. I had a problem with Foxx's clumsy performance as Max but once he becomes Electro he does look menacing. I didn't care too much about the villains or the action set pieces despite the fact that they were well crafted. The inner struggles that Peter Parker faces with his family drama and relationship with Gwen is at the heart of this film. The final act is more than just a gigantic action face-off, there is actually a lot of emotional elements at stake and that is what lifted this movie as it finished on a high note. There was a very emotional scene scene near the end of the film that left the entire theater in silence. The best thing about this sequel is that it was much more emotionally involving than the original and it banks its strength from Andrew Garfield's charismatic and spot on performance as Peter Parker.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
8.5/10,"Lets give a disclaimer here: I am a comic book nerd-geek and Spider-Man is one of my favorite fictional characters ever, so maybe I am inclined to be fully absorbed by this movie very easily, yet this doesn't take away from my film nerd-fan side that genuinely thought very highly of this film from a simple filmaking point of view. As storytelling goes I was very-pleasantly surprised to find a really strong grip: it never commits the Spider-Man 3 mistake of being over-crowded and maintains a brilliant balance on all the characters flowing naturally with a story that feels perfectly fine despite the pressure it had from Sony. It never tries to be over intricate but manages to pull of multiple inter-twining story lines in a magnificent way. Never does it leave loose ends and that is something I hadn't seen in a comic-book movie for a couple of years. Furthermore it isn't a banal plot, there of course are some clichéd moments but as much as they don't get me in 90% of movies they got me here (credit to director/actors for making those few feel very spontaneous), it has valid originality and keeps a core fidelity to the source material that deserves high praise. Just as good is the way in which this sequel builds on its predecessor tying up loose ends, proceeding with minor story lines of the first movie and adding great parts in it. As a director Webb proves to be amazing. The action scenes are complexly put together, with visual brilliance and continuity in them. Great improvement from the first movie. They really were breathtaking, nail-biting sequences that found me on the edge of my seat continuously. Another visual aspect that is stunning is the swinging sequences of Spider-Man: this is what I always wanted to see but never fully experienced with the other Spider-Man movies; the shots there were fantastic. Yet what I most admire Webb for is the talent he has for character development and coherence, we have seen this in his previous two movies and here it is firing once again in all cylinders. There just isn't one character in whom I did not believe, I never spotted the stereotypical comic-book person in here. Everybody had there chance to shine. Sure a couple of characters have minor short-comings and I understand if somebody doesn't believe in Electro's personality, but I found that it walked the line between movie acceptability and comic-book campyness in the perfect dose. To this I also have to give credit to the soundtrack which blew me totally away when Electro is introduced to the public: that was some serious use of music and sounds for storytelling, brilliant, intelligent! Adding to this is a really powerful score from Hans Zimmer, one of the better ones I have heard from him and generally in recent years. Our introduction to Harry Osborn/Green Goblin was positive on the character part (indeed there was no need for him to be green goblin in this one but I honestly did not mind him), yet from an acting point of view I think Dane Dehaan overacted in some scenes, nevertheless he was good enough. There have been many criticisms of this movie in regards to messy tone, unoriginality and rushed villains and as much as I see where people are coming from and I would indeed have appreciated a more untraditional villain(s) introduction and story I just never thought of that during the movie: there are many movies in which I simply cannot be taken in because of originality issues, but for some reason this one felt to me so fluent I never had any problems with this and actually felt it kept a consistent tone throughout. Yet I must address the fact that watching it twice I could feel the studio putting too much of its hand in the movie: they were way to manipulative of this and I think that by leaving Marc Webb just some more creative power this movie could have been enormously better. The CGI wasn't always seamless but great in many moments and anyways it never bothered me because the story was always the driving force behind it and what I was most interested in: this also speaks to the fact that the action was used to propel the plot so it never felt out of place, that is something really hard to pull off. There is lots of humor in the film and I can safely say that it actually is very funny and very faithful to who Spider-Man is and how he acts and to expand on this the humor fits both the tone of the movie and the storytelling, speaking again to the fact that, just like the action, it is used appropriately for the character development or the story, it is never gratuitous. I was excepting more fan service, but I can't really fault the movie for not satisfying my unsatisfiable thirst for it, that was nevertheless kept at bay. ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"" truly was a comic book movie. It took the best aspects of the two world and combined them in what I always figured in my head when I read Spider-Man comics. Yet, I have been holding back this for all my review and here it is: what truly is the best part of the movie, the most riveting element, the thing that Webb does best in a really majestical way, the driving force behind this film, the main reason and thing that kept me most absorbed in the drama and what gives it honest emotional depth is the relationship between Gwen Stacy and Peter Parker. honestly do not know how Webb is so amazingly good with romance and character interaction but what we have here (and in the previous movie) is something really special.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Too much, too unbalanced and a waste of talent","I can't say I went in to the theater with high hopes. I did enjoy the first installment of this unnecessary reboot, almost anything seemed like a step up from ""Spiderman 3"", and Garfield felt way more natural than Maguire, and Emma Stone is always welcome. But after seeing the first trailer I thought it seemed like a total mess, and I wasn't convinced by Electro one bit. Unfortunately I was spot on, I hoped to at least get an enjoyable time at the cinema with my friends, but ended up feeling quite uncomfortable and laughing throughout most of the film.Garfield and Stone has their chemistry and does their best with the incredibly thin script and cheesy one-liners, but their potential quite beautiful scenes together gets lost in the over-full and messy plot. I can't buy an emotional scene that is interrupted by heavy dub-step and a blue electric guy.Oh Jamie Foxx, how did you go from Django to this? Before he goes all CGI-Electro he tries to play the nerdy unseen scientist (with a worse comb-over than Christian Bale's 'Hustle'-look). As Electro it's hard to say how much is his fault, and what can be blamed on the rest, I'd go with the rest. You don't sympathize with him nor do you believe how fast he becomes this super-villain.Everything that Dane DeHaan did so well in ""Chronicle"" just feels unnatural and (maybe not misplaced, but wrong) here. And his character development is way too rushed and quite unnecessary for this film, it just becomes another sub-plot standing in the way of what really matters.Sally Field does good work as Aunt May, but leaves no lasting mark. Paul Giamatti's Russian criminal is just in the way and only gives a couple of dreadful and laughable scenes. And then there's the mad German scientist named Kafka and I rest my case.The action and visuals isn't bad, but still doesn't make up for the low ""trying to be Marvel""-comedy and horrific soundtrack, a soundtrack that almost itself destroys the film throughout the exhausting 142 minutes. And sometimes it feels like the movie is taking us as an audience to be stupid, with pointers to what is going to happen. I would like to say that you might enjoy it if you just try and see it for what it is, but it's hard, but hopefully possible! It had an interesting start, with a glimpse inside the past and Peter's parents, but it's left underdeveloped, as is almost everything else, to make room for all its action and villains.It's amazing how the difference between two big-budget superhero-movies can be so huge, if you put this against ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", a great and, opposed to this one, original film.Oh how I wish that Marc Webb could have continued with a ""(500) Days of Summer""-esque movie instead, he could keep the sub-plots starring Garfield, Stone and DeHaan, and it could very well be a great film, and probably not such a waste of talent.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better action,"My wish for you is to become hope. People need that.The second Amazing Spider-Man movie, and it was pretty amazing for me. Electro is probably the best Spider-Man villain, not in terms of characterization, but in terms of coolness and power. That last fight scene was so dope with the electricity that made all the music. Blue is a great color for Electro. He is also very powerful, and he definitely could have done more than in the movie.Andrew Garfield again brought charisma to the our favorite local superhero. And just like in the first, Peter and Gwen had such amazing charm and chemistry, only because of the actors.My problem is although they revealed more about Peter's parents, it kinda led to nothing. I was quite disappointed in that. Then, Harry Osborn was pretty boring and just rushed.Overall, it was just slightly better than the other Spider-Man (of course not even close to Spider-Man 2) because of a cooler villain. 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Better than I thought it would have been,"Just finished watching this movie,Holy Craaap. It's one of the best superhero movie I have seen in a long time, the story, the acting, the chemistry, the action was damn awesome. The only complained I had with this movie was that sometimes it felt a little bit long but after a while I forgot it was really long. The 3D was really good comparing to other 3D superhero movies. I can't wait for all the fans and movie fans of movie watch this. The villains are good in this movie, the green goblin was a little bit creepy than I thought it would have been, Electro looked really cool with his electric power, Rhino was there for about 2 minutes which was at the end. I thought they should never have shown the rhino at the poster or trailer at all,instead they could surprise us spider man fighting rhino at the end.

Brings out the true Comic-book Spiderman feel,"A very entertaining and gripping mix between ""funny comic book superhero"" portrayal and heartwarming, serious emotions. This is by far the best Spiderman movie of the five.Right from the start you begin to realize how in this movie the action scenes are not executed in a dead-serious end of the world manner like the previous spider-man movies, which made me feel more connected to this movie than the others. This is how spider-man should have always been portrayed, unlike superman or batman. Andrew Garfield delivers the role in a very balanced and well done manner yet again. He had the chance to dive deeper into the role in this movie compared to the previous one. The chemistry between him and Emma stone on screen is one of the best aspects of this movie.Another thing I enjoyed about this movie were the villains, which surprisingly everyone seemed to dislike. The characters in the movie weren't too much in any way, certainly not as much as in the previous Spiderman 3.Even tho the movie didn't feel like it was something completely new, and doesn't seem to pull off something unexpected or revolutionary (In regards to film making, not Spiderman story-wise) I still felt like it was one of the most engaging and entertaining movies I have seen in a long time",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good but not great,"Once again a good example about movie that critics don't like, but I enjoy to watch. Of course this isn't greatest movie of history, but as a comic book filming it is very entertaining. Spider-Man's leaps between skyscrapers are beautiful to watch especially in 3D experience is like sitting on a roller coaster. Andrew Garfield is great as a Spider-Man, Emma Stone succeed well as Spider-Man's girl friend despite the tragical end. Sally Field is always great actress. Only Jamie Foxx don't convince in his role as a nerd. Luckily he act nerd only half of the film and the rest of the movie he is digitally enhanced Electro. Story is entertaining and pretentious comic book adaption and that is the way it should been watch. Albeit the dialogue is quite childish at time to time it doesn't bother too much. Lots of popcorn and enough of soda is all you need to enjoy this movie. If you want to say something bad about the movie you could say it has been inflate to so big that it will be a hard to surpass on next movie. Movies massive budget (200 million dollars) is hard to cross over. On the other hand if movie makes enough profit as theatrical release couple of more millions should not be any infeasible to approve.http://tinovalkki.blogaaja.fi/",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Impressive spectacle but overstuffed and empty,"Both Amazing Spider-Man films get a lot of hate, and while for me they weren't as bad as all that(if anything personally they were moderately enjoyable films) I do agree with a lot of the criticisms for both. Some say the sequel is better, personally the first while being very over-familiar and unevenly paced and with a severely underdeveloped villain the first was a little better but still fell far short. There are good things about the sequel. Once again it is very stylishly made and the special effects are better this time round, while the action sequences provide some thrills. The chemistry between Peter and Gwen is still sweet, Peter at the grave is actually quite moving and the closest the film ever gets to having any emotional impact and some of the acting is good. Andrew Garfield's performance is much better here, he doesn't ever quite capture Spider-Man's vulnerability but he is much less smug and tones down the quirkiness. Emma Stone is a charming and very likable Gwen, Sally Field gives seasoned support as Aunt May although she doesn't have much to do and Dane DeHaan does a great job showing Harry Osborn's slow descent into fear and loneliness. However, Jamie Foxx despite looking really cool doesn't do anything with Electro and looks lost and Paul Giamatti is completely wasted and gives a rare bad performance. The script and the way the characters are written don't help, the script is very thinly sketched and tries to balance comedy and pathos and does so awkwardly, to the extent the comedy feels overly-broad and out of place and the pathos apart from one part is non-existent literally. And the film does suffer from too many characters and most of them with little development, with the two leads the most interesting characters. There are two too many villains(the same problem that Spider-Man 3 had) and none of them developed very well, Osborn/Green Goblin just about musters due to DeHaan but his development still feels rushed and some of his actions out of the blue, the villain also deserved a much better resurrection which was cheaply done. Like Lizard in the first film Electro is very one-dimensional with no motivation, or shall we say no obvious one, and Rhino feels like a just-there-for-the-sake-of-it character. The story doesn't suffer from being over-familiar like the first Amazing Spider-Man but it does suffer from a very sprawling structure and a lot of it feels over-stuffed and plodding. The music has its moments and does fit better than James Horner's for the first Amazing Spider Man but it does lack pace and one of those pleasant-to-listen-to-but-easily-forgettable scores, three composers are credited and the score sometimes sounds like that is the case. All in all, moderately enjoyable and visually impressive, and Garfield is much more at ease here, but it does suffer from trying to do too much and feels empty and emotionally-lacking. 5/10 Bethany",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good,"Superheroes are heroic because they feel a moral obligation to help the average Joe. Not this Spider-Man. All the characters struggle against the system that has perpetuated falsehoods. The main characteristic of the film is the gloomy atmosphere, emphasizing the desolate hopelessness. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. The acting is very effective. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed. They do however drive the story, which seemed to be their purpose, so I can accept them. But it's a two-hour pile of destructive self-obsession.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Spidey Swings into Action,"Spider-Man's film franchise has always been a bumpy road with Sony Pictures. The Sam Raimi trilogy for the most part revitalised the Superhero genre that was stuck in the mud with the abysmal Batman and Robin. The first Spidey outing changed the genre around and managed to get fans interested in the characters and the storyline once again. The sequel improved with a more complex villain and better character development. However, fans lost faith with the threequel and Spidey's future was stuck to one huge tangle of a web.Then along came Marc Webb, with The Amazing Spider-Man which was shrugged off by the critics and called a cash grab. However, whatever criticisms there have been of the previous four films this one seems devoid of all of them and gives fans what they have longed for; an exciting, mesmerising and pulse- pounding adventure one that stays true to the comics.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a jam packed film and every shot has been thoroughly examined and expertly directed by Marc Webb. The effects are the best that they have ever looked, the characters are fully developed and we care more than we ever have done about them all and the action and story threads are not all over the place. The beauty of TASM 2 lies in the fact that the origins of Spidey have been set up and he is free to roam this spectacularly created world.It is fair to say that there has not been much hype surrounding this superhero sequel and going in with high but not extreme expectations it blew them out of the park so effortlessly I was left gob-smacked. This leaves us with undoubtedly a Superhero for the ages and the best outing for any standalone character since The Dark Knight Rises.The score composed by Hans Zimmer shows off his mastery of the Superhero genre of music and his themes for Spidey, Electro and Goblin are always enthralling and only add to the burst of colour and energy that we receive on screen. Here's to hoping he can stay on as he proves himself a worthy heir to Danny Elfman's Spidey scores.Furthermore, the story threads are balanced with ease and that is not a small task to be had. There are three villains; Electro, the Green Goblin and the Rhino. The rhino played with a maniac twist by Paul Giamatti relishes the short screen time he gets and leaves us longing for more (which will come with TASM 3). The goblin (Dane DeHaan) gives a better performance than the campy version we got with Willem Dafoe in 2002. He brings menace and I was shaken up when we hear his manic cackle from afar off screen. His relationship with Peter is explored and his origin story is told well and most importantly of all his character motivations makes sense. Electro (Jamie Foxx) gives a career changing performance and matches if not exceeding Doc Ock in 2004. He is similar to this character as he is more of a tragic villain, striving to be noticed and changing by a terrible accident into the deformed and terrifying Electro. He changes so drastically throughout the film's runtime it leaves us with a Spidey villain for the ages.Gwen and Peter's relationship is given plenty of depth and is not (thankfully) lost in the plethora of set pieces and action scenes that frequently take place. The struggle of Peter's double life gives us many twists and turns. Andrew Garfield (who is by far the greatest Spidey and Peter Parker) and Emma Stone light up the screen with their meaningful and charismatic chemistry ensuring that sometimes two people talking can be just as exciting as watching the action unfold.The final end scene is heartfelt, surely bringing a tear to even the most cold-hearted of people and will definitely leave viewers overwhelmed by the direction this sequel takes, yet it is never clichéd, boring or predictable.This is a smart film and should be the template for Superhero sequels to follow in many years to come; it is a game changer one that breaks the mould and sets the bar as high as Spidey's web can reach. Webb will need to be on top form to exceed this rare thing; a Superhero Masterpiece.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Great Spider Man movie!,"First off, I'd like to say that I really did not like the first Amazing Spider-Man, so my expectations were really low coming in to part 2. I was pleasantly surprised by it though. This movie has action, comedy and drama in a perfect balance. I was worried that there would be too many bad guys in this movie, but they did it just right. If I had one complaint, it would be that Harry Osborne's transition to the Green Goblin could have been done differently, it felt a bit rushed to me, but the rest of the movie makes up for it. Another highlight for me was the soundtrack and score of the movie. The music when Electro is in Times Square is amazingly well done.Overall I liked this movie a lot because it really felt like the Spider-Man I knew from the comics.There was a mid credits scene of the X-Men: Days of Future Past movie, but I really didn't like that scene.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"When they say amazing, they're not kidding.","I saw this last night, and honestly, it was the most fun I've had at the cinema since 'Catching Fire'! It was such a good movie, and I wasn't even expecting it to be!Of course, I could be biased here, since I'm a bit of a spiderman fan (always have been, always will be), but this is my new favourite superhero movie! (my last one was Thor...go fig!)The visuals were brilliant, and the cgi was absolutely fantastic! The scenes with Electro were so impressive, I almost couldn't believe my eyes! The script was pretty good, and as always, Marc Webb's direction was impeccable, so no complaints on that front.Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone were on top form once again, and their chemistry was just mind blowing! How cute! Jamie Foxx did VERY well as Max Dillon/Electro, making me feel sympathy for Max, and terrified of Electro! Chris Cooper...what can I say? His performance was short, sweet, and superb as always.Star player, however, simply has to go to Dane DeHann! He's been one of my favourite actors (along with Miles Teller, Jeremy Renner and Evan Peters) ever since I saw 'Lawless', and once again, he certainly didn't disappoint! His performance was my favourite aspect of the film! I don't mean to gush, but he played Harry with a mix of charming, funny, creepy and scary! Just...amazing!I laughed so much, I cried so hard, and I definitely wouldn't hesitate if asked to go see it again! Highly recommended.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
it was really good,"I'm not a big fan of super hero's movies. but i quite like this one. when it comes to the technical part, the images, sounds, filming and directing stuff it was great.but when it comes to the story, it was a bit twilighty. it was a love story more than a superhero's one. i found my self emotionally involved with the characters and their relationship more that the action part which is the whole movie based on. I mean, I like the new version of spider man i find it more realistic, I liked peter and how he added a great sense of humour to the character. even Gwen and Harry they were great.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spends most of its time setting up future movies ...,"""The Amazing Spider-man 2"" is a tough one. A Movie I can't actually figure out whether I liked or not. Parts of it were actually amazing. While other parts were far from it.I Think the main problem with this second Spider-man movie (Or is it fifth Spider-man movie?) is that the film before it still feels like a re-run. Yes, as good as ""The Amazing Spider-man"" was. It still felt over-shadowed by three previous movies that didn't really deserve to get ignored. I left that one thinking ""Oh well, at least they've got the setting up out of the way, and can get on with doing something different in the next one."" Trouble is, they haven't. This one also spends most of its time setting up future movies. While other parts bring nothing new and feel like more repeats. I mean, wasn't that ""Washing machine"" gag done in the other ""Spider-man 2?""The biggest mistake ""The Amazing Spider-man 2"" makes though. Is one that this series should already have learnt not to do. And that's under-using its villain. The main bad guy off this one is suppose to be Electro. A Bad-guy that was always going to be a tough sell, and they don't quite manage it. In the Cartoons he looks so ridiculous that they've had to entirely redesign him, which is cool. But the character is ruined after an amazing intro by being under-used yet over done.The ""Real"" main villain of the movie is Harry Osborne (Dane DeHann) and although this is one of the things that has been done before, he is arguably the best thing in the movie. The minute DeHann was cast I knew he would be great, and he is. His ""dual identity"" too, has been redesigned, but for the better. With a new take, that makes the future of the series at least look promising.But what about this movie? It likes building up future ideas, but there must be something else good about it by itself? Well, Andrew Garfield is still pleasing fans as Spider-man, and his chemistry with Emma Stone is still strong. Providing the movie with most of its laughs, charm, and in some parts, genuine tears. But we watch Spider-man for the action, right? And most of the action too, is still cool. Even if the series has far from reinvented itself, and is still spending a bit too much time on Spider-man's love life, than his crime fighting.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Often more is worse and this movie was the case, but...","Spidey is back and ready to show us the potential of their own universe.The power of OSCORP has been declining due to large-scale accidents related to this. With the death of its CEO, Norman Osborn, is the height of his son, Harry Osborn, taking the reins of the business, but your priorities may jeopardize the company. In trying to find a cure for his condition, Harry uses all the resources of OSCORP to get something that Spider-man has. Meanwhile, Peter Parker discovers what it means to be the friend of the whole neighborhood.Expectations were very high for this sequel. Once you have done a fantastic job in ""The Amazing Spider-man"", Marc Webb returns to take charge of this new franchise head web, and despite its realization have fulfilled all expectations, the film as a whole left a bit to be desired . This is not just a story of Spider-man, but the door to an expansion of the universe for this character. Many say that ""Iron Man 2"" was like a trailer for ""The Avengers"", this was (partly) a trailer for the movie of the Sinister Six.The film certainly has a lot more than what is necessary. The opening scene, in which we saw the same opening scene of the previous film but this time from the perspective of the father of Peter, has no impact on history. We have three villains in all, Electro, Green Goblin and Rhino. The first is the main villain of the film. It is one that has a greater presence on the screen and cause more problems to the hero. The Green Goblin, well, not in the movie for only one thing that will not be mentioned. And then we have the Rhino, which has no role in the film is limited to only appear at the beginning and end.The cast returned to do a fantastic job and greater recognition goes to the new faces. Jamie Foxx stands out first by being concise throughout the film. The other new member that deserves to be recognized is Dane DeHaan for his Harry Osborn / Green Goblin was at least perfect. The work that the actor did with what he was given, was phenomenal. Forget Willem Dafoe and James Franco, if ever there was a good Green Goblin was the DeHaan despite all the problems that caused the plot in character.The universe of Spider-man is very rich, and often more is worse and this movie was the case. If they had taken things more calmly could have taken the ideas of this film and have done two. What counts is what this is ultimately good save and make us accept his blunders.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A spectacular sequel with great character and story development,"I just came back from the cinema to type up my wonderful opinion on this movie. That's how you know it's good.Firstly, the chemistry between Peter and Gwen is really pure which is what makes the film interesting. I like the way Sony didn't focus the film on just action and CGI but they added another story to make you feel something within. No joke. The villains too were just amazing.The plot was very unpredictable which just made my day because the things that take place makes you unbelievably satisfied.Please check this film out because you are hurting yourself for not doing so.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Not perfect, but doesn't deserve the sheer amount of hatred","Alright, I know I'm not the populist opinion here, so I'll go ahead and say what I think and try to articulate why I think this movie is probably the best Spider-man movie to date.First off, I don't like the Raimi films, I tried my absolute best to tolerate the ridiculous cheese, underacting (McGuire and Dunst) and overacting (Pretty much everyone else) the hoaky writing, the plot holes, the weird character motivations, but I couldn't. I feel that everyone who compares the new Amazing flicks to the Raimi trilogy misses the point of a reboot, its not supposed to be like the old movies, that's the idea.First off, its undeniable that Garfield far outshines McGuire as an actor, and as Spider-man. Not only that, but even without the comparison, he manages to play a likable and natural High-Schooler (Despite the fact that he looks like he's in college) Emma Stone, well, she almost makes the movie. Marc Webb can definitely write chemistry between characters well, and with Gwen and Peter, it really shines. I genuinely cared about the romance in both movies, which I could not say for the old films.The other actors are all solid, Jamie Foxx is a great actor, and while his part is not original, it is entertaining and well acted. Props also to Dane Dehaan, who is a great actor and a fantastic Harry Osbourne.Is this movie the mess of a plot everyone says it is? Not really. I was never confused or befuddled by the absurdity of the plot or situation at hand. However, the only thing I can honestly fault on the film can be Sony's marketing. Putting the Rhino in the trailers was idiotic considering he's in two scenes, and yes, the film feels like its fulfilling a quota of things to do with its plot, but here's the catch: its entertaining. The characters are fun to watch, the story keeps true to the Ultimate Spiderman mythos, and it genuinely makes you care for everyone you are supposed to care for. This, in my opinion is the best Spiderman movie we've had, its enjoyable, exciting, heartfelt, and a very well-written film, but Sony's meddling is very evident.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Not-so Amazing Spider-Man,"It honestly shocks me as to how people gave this steaming pile of dogsh** a good score. If I could give this movie a 0, I would.

A huge step up from the first film.,"Although it didn't manage to find its feet until the last act, the amazing Spider-Man 2 is stall a surprisingly good sequel that obliterates the first film. As you can tell I did not enjoy the first film very much I found it a average movie with a horrible villain and a re used narrative. However the second film in the series managed to reassure me that their is stall hope in this franchise. Marc Webb seems to have a better hold on the story he's trying to tell in this film and the relationship between Gwen and Peter is tremendous. Andrew Garfield shows us his acting shops throughout this movie and blows Toby Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker completely away. However the film with all the amazing things it does stall has some flaws. The villain's such as electro and rhino are very cheesy and unconvincingly acted which is very strange due to the actors who are very skilled that portray them. But Dane Dehaan as Harry Osbourne does a brilliant job reassuring his acting ability in Hollywood as he brings a memorable performance to his character. The film also sets up future movies and spinoffs perfectly with a large amount of Easter eggs scattered throughout. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a much better film then the first amazing Spider-Man and packs a huge emotional punch however a stilted narrative and a few wooden characters hold it back from its true potential. Hopefully future spidey films in this universe will solidify Spider-Man as one of the greats.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Nice visuals, a great soundtrack and a solid Spider-Man movie!","Since this movie was released I've seen it a couple of times. And I always come to the same conclusion, this wasent bad at all.
Garfield does a solid Spider-Man. It's not the same ""nerdish and a little shy like"" version as Tobey Maguire did, but instead it's a more straight forward Spider-Man/Peter Parker that feels a bit more modern at times. The old trilogy is classics already by all means, but this one felt more visual pleasing somehow.
The chemistry between Garfield and Emma Stone is still there. Sure the story of one of the bad guys played by Jaime Foxx felt a bit too much to maybe make me sympathize with him turning over to the darkside. But then again with great powers comes maybe too much responsibility for some right? Some people just can't handle the power. We can still understand his motives so it doesnt take much away from the action. And this movie felt really great when it comes to visally upgrading the action scenes, making spidey more visually stunning with it's more colorfull visuals then maybe ever before.
I also think Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborn felt alot better then the original trilogys version that felt flat and childish. This one had depth and his own motives and struggles.
The soundtrack is another great one from Hanz Zimmer that adds another level of the emotions felt by the characters and the scenes.
All in all i think this one did alot better then people give it credit for. And it feels like a missed oppertunity not making a 3rd one. They had alot of potential moving forward from this one, without going into spoilers. Instead we ended up with a new Spidey that doesn't do it bad either but feels a bit too childish for my taste. This one felt more like a middleground suited for all ages, like it should be.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""A Web of Overambition""","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 aimed to expand the universe established in its predecessor but ultimately became entangled in its own web of complexity.The film continued to explore Peter Parker's (Andrew Garfield) personal struggles, delving deeper into his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Their chemistry remained a highlight, and the film's emotional core was undeniably strong.The introduction of multiple villains proved to be a misstep. Electro (Jamie Foxx), while visually striking, lacked depth, and his character arc felt rushed. Harry Osborn's (Dane DeHaan) transformation into the Green Goblin was foreshadowed but executed hastily, depriving the villain of a compelling backstory.The film hinted at a larger Sinister Six plot with the appearance of Rhino and a tease of other villains. However, this setup felt rushed and overshadowed the core narrative.The film's action sequences were visually impressive, and the web-slinging sequences continued to be a standout. However, the pacing was uneven, with some scenes feeling drawn out while others rushed.The tragic climax involving Gwen Stacy was undoubtedly heartbreaking, but it also felt manipulative and predictable. While it served as a significant turning point for Peter Parker, it overshadowed other elements of the film.Despite these flaws, the film showcased impressive action sequences, particularly the electric-charged battles involving Electro. The chemistry between Garfield and Stone remained a highlight, and their performances elevated the film's emotional impact.Ultimately, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was a victim of its own ambition. While it offered some thrilling moments, the overstuffed plot and underdeveloped villains hindered its overall potential.

Terrible Story and Villains,"""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is the worst movie of this hero, with terrible story and villains and boring romance. Max Dillon, a.k.a. Electro, is a needy moronic lonely engineer that worships the Spider-Man and after an accident, he becomes a powerful stupid enemy that destroys part of New York. Harry Osborn, a.k.a. Green Goblin, is poorly developed; when his father is on the death bed, he learns that he has the same disease that is killing him and becomes CEO of the corporation without any experience. Soon he makes a quick research, has a short dialog with the Spider–Man and becomes his enemy after an announced accident. The romance between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy is boring and repetitive. There is an importance in Peter Parker's parents and Uncle Ben is practically forgotten. There are good action scenes and special effects but that is all.

Entertaining RIde!,"'The amazing spider man 2' presents itself as a a very entertaining popcorn movie with the likes of Andrew Garfield at the helm of the character Spider-man, in which he is perfectly suited. He delivers again the second time around as a relatable teenager who is just graduating from high school and is having problems with his love interest Gwen Stacy played by Emma Stone as he is concerned for her safety. As the film opens we see that he is back to his usual of fighting crime, and the city itself have accepted spider-man as a hero . Peter Parker has a lot on his plate in this one as he discovers the mystery behind his parents abrupt disappearance from his life as a young boy where he delves further into the truth. He is also challenged by the antagonist Electro played by Jamie fox as a man who seeks to be noticed by others. Among the new characters is also Harry Osborne Peter Parkers childhood friend from the past who has come back to New York city where he learns a terrible truth about Oscorp and the Osborne family curse, as he tries to seeks out spider-mans help.As a whole this is a very enjoyable film that has many flaws but are excused by the very well done action scenes that have very impressive CGI, especially the New York central scene with Electro. The relationship between Peter and Gwen is well done as that is director Mark Webbs strongest points to making a movie that involve the relationships between the key characters. The acting is fine by the main actors which also includes the likes of sally field who plays Peters Aunt may and newcomer to the series Jamie Foxx is okay too as Electro.The gripes that I have about the film is that it is all a bit clustered, with too much going on, which brought me back to the terrible spider man 3 but definitely no where near that bad. I think that Harry Osborn could have been fleshed out more as a character and also cast more appropriately. Electro was an exceptional villain from the film as we see the problems he suffers through in life.Overall many fans of the series and genre and genre will enjoy this experience. The film has great acting and the movie is worth it for the entertainment value with awesome CGI, but the movie strives to hard to be bigger than it should be, and expands too much as the film runs overlong by the two hour mark. Mark Webb did an excellent job putting this film together but their is much too that can be improved on for 'The Amazing Spiderman 3' which I'm sure will be very successful as well as this film when it opens world wide.Solid 7/10",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The best rendition of Spiderman yet!,"The relationship between Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) has infinitely more chemistry than Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst which is why The Amazing Spiderman series is superior to the previous Sam Raimi helmed version of Spiderman. The supporting cast notably Jamie Foxx as Max/ Electro, Dane Dehaan as Harry Osborne and also Sally Field and Aunt May are excellent in their respective roles – and also much more fleshed out then usual. Amazing Spiderman 2 manages to slow down the pace and tell a human story while leaving plenty of time for action. While the first Amazing Spiderman was an origin story and more grounded in action scenes Amazing Spiderman 2 pulls out all the stops and looks absolutely fantastic. The strength and chemistry of the lead two characters is the real gem here though striking an emotional chord while the action climaxes in an epic and unforgettable finale. Amazing Spiderman 2 is a rousing success, topping the first in this series and leaving us wanting more. The best rendition of Spiderman yet!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This Spider-Man is indeed amazing - But the web spun around it feels clumsy,"This Spider-Man is indeed amazing, but the web spun around the film is somewhat clumsy, with too many fuzzy strands to do the wall crawler justice.Okay, now that the obligatory Spidey metaphor is out of the way - Amazing Spider-Man 2 is in my opinion stronger than it's predecessor but falls far short of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 benchmark. Might not be a fair comparison though since I still contend that Raimi's Spider-Man 2 is in my top 5 comic book films of all time. Garfield is cutting the perfect figure as the web slinger and sharing an infectious on screen chemistry with Emma Sone as Gwen Stacey.But my beef with this films lays with two main problems - the writers and the director. Sure, there was some bad acting as well, but I believe that was due to the script the actors were handed.Let me say, I enjoyed this film, in fact I really enjoyed this film but I do have to talk about the parts that I didn't enjoy first so I can get to the good stuff later.Okay so problem number one, the writing in this film is bad, like blatantly bad. I mean, they nailed Spideys comic-book-perfect sarcasm but other than that.. nope not cutting it. I looked the writers up on IMDb to see the rest of credits... mystery solved! It's scripted by the same duo behind the Transformers franchise - suddenly it's shortcomings become more understandable. Kurtzman and Orci are masters of ''whizz-bang'' ''oohs'' and ''aahs'' shoehorned into a mechanical plot provided to advance the story but nothing more. All the baddie origins here make you wistful for the Sandman creation sequence in Spider-Man 3, which isn't something I thought I'd ever say. Electro is lumbered with a shockingly clichéd birth with Foxx struggling (and failing) to make him anything more than the film's time bomb to be diffused. The electric effects are great though if that makes up for anything, and his face-offs with Spidey really do pop.Problem number two is that of director Marc Webb - Webb struggles to maintain a coherent tone, often veering between hyper-real CGI mayhem and soft-focus Twilight-esque teen dreaminess. This is what really threw me off - one second you're watching this great spectacle of an action scene, and then within literally seconds the scene along with the dialogue turns to this really cheesy nonsensical Twilight-esque love scene but with Garfield in tights. I guess the best way to describe it would be like squinting to focus your eyes – all the elements are there but you just can't quite see them all at once. You could tell the film is designed to attract audiences of all demographics, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing - if only it didn't make everything feel shoehorned in. It basically struggles to be it's own thing, even if Raimi's incarnation weren't to your taste, the films did clearly have a defined style that made them distinctive.I feel kind of like saying more would spoil the film and it's still good enough to avoid doing that.Aaand finally we get to the things I liked about the film, credit where credit is due.This Spidey flick does go places that the previous incarnation shied away from and even tweaks the tear ducts ever so slightly at points. Comic-book fans will certainly be pleased to see some elements - Spidey's sarcasm - be more in line with the comic books.The film opens with public support growing in the web heads favor as Parker graduates high school and starts college. However, Spider-Man finds himself up against a new foe - Electro played by Jamie Foxx. Meanwhile the return of his childhood friend Harry Osborn played by Dane DeHaan threatens to throw his life into even further chaos. As to be expected, cue plenty of plot twists that anyone with half a brain could see coming from a mile away and mayhem on a city-wide scale. You certainly can't fault it for its scope.People have been so scared of the amount of villains in the film, pretty much everyone I know was expecting another Spider-Man 3 fiasco – but I have to say, the clutter of villains is actually more about setting up spin-offs and further sequels than overcrowding. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the villains work though – they are hampered by mechanical plotting which of course leads back to the writing that also holds Webb's film back from really hitting the heights it could've.At least Webb and the writers do wrap up and tie a bow on the somewhat irritating parents-as-spy-scientists story thread, thankfully not robbing Peter of his ''ordinary Joe'' back story as the first film threatened to do. With the past dealt with, you realize how much time has been spent on it and with the middle of the film getting dangerously close to being boring. This is especially frustrating when we're rushed into the final reel, ruing the lack of time for stronger character work that could have made the ensuing drama even more impactive.As the credits roll, the exciting action and Spidey's comic-book-perfect sarcasm stay longest in the mind, just winning the day, along with Garfield and Stone's genuinely effective relationship. It's just a shame they're not better served by a film that isn't the sum of its often- inspired parts.But here's the big question - If you find yourself standing at your cinema with a choice between The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and Captain America 2, Marvel still triumphs in my opinion. Spidey is always worth watching though and admittedly did leave me with a desire to see more.If you want more reviews please visit www.themoviecorner.net, thanks for reading!",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Andrew's chance when his absolute performance rise, he got ripped by Sony","At just under two and a half hours, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" isn't just a raucous good time. Director Marc Webb's follow-up to the 2012 franchise reboot capably picks up the pieces. Andrew Garfield excels at conveying fragility without losing all of his machismo at once. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is both messy and persistently thrilling. I said this movie it's the franchise's best entry and its least humane, despite struggles to the contrary.The film has a beating heart trapped in the vast machine of the Hollywood entertainment complex. Webb has completed two multimillion dollar superhero movies in the five years since his first feature. Webb continues to show some of the tender sensibilities on display in his debut, 2009's ""(500) Days of Summer"". The movie's smaller moments rank as its strongest, for once turning Spider-Man into the flustered young man. ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" has moments of levity, but no leverage over the boundaries of its formula. The film shows the capacity for a master showman to spin Hollywood elements in fresh ways.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Fun, well done and well acted, but with script problems, Spectacular Spider-Man 2 has great chances of repeating the success of the previous film","Despite some criticisms, the previous film received several positive reviews, in addition to a good result at the box office worldwide, thus guaranteeing a sequel. Again directed by Marc Webb and scripted by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Jeff Pinkner and James Vanderbilt based on the characters created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, we see the return of Andrew Garfield as our hero, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy, as well as Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHaan, Paul Giamatti in the roles of the main antagonists.In this sequence, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) loves to be Spider-Man, even though being the arachnid hero puts him in very complicated situations, especially with his girlfriend Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and aunt May (Sally Field). Despite this, he balances his various facets as well as he can. At the moment, Peter is more concerned with the ghost of the promise made to Gwen's father, that he would walk away from her to protect her. At the same time he has to deal with the return of an old friend, Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), and the emergence of a powerful villain: Electro (Jamie Foxx).""Spectacular Spider-Man 2"" continues several plots presented in the previous film, showing Peter who remains Spider-Man and helping to save New York City and who also works as a photographer for the Daily Bugle. In love, he continued the relationship with Gwen Stacy, but he lives tormented by the promise made to the father of his love, which ends up wanting to cause a series of conflicts in the relationship and distancing him from Gwen even with the two loving each other. This plot is interesting and makes the relationship evolve, bringing new questions, such as the proposal for Gwen - who continues to work at Oscorp Industries - to study in Oxford, England amid the separation of the couple, which leads them to question whether they should or not to follow different paths in life. Would the couple's love be enough to forget past promises and move on, respecting each other's choice? Once again the chemistry of the couple Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone - who at the time were also a couple in real life - is genuine and engaging. The pair of great actors manage to pass all the complicity and love to overcome the barriers in their relationship. They understand each other in looks, in conversations, in small teasing with each other. By the way, Gwen has a much greater importance than it already had in the previous feature.The character Mary Jane Watson would have a small appearance in this film and would certainly assume the role of Peter's love interest in an eventual conclusion of this second trilogy of the character, especially after the events of the last act of this second part. Mary Jane would be played by Shailene Woodley, who even filmed some scenes like the character in the film, however, months before the premiere, it was announced that Mary Jane was cut from the film. Director Marc Webb later said the cut was ""a creative decision to simplify the story and focus only on Peter and Gwen and their relationship"".
Another plot that has new developments is the past of Peter's parents and how he continues to influence the hero in his decisions. The script shows us more of what happened to the parents just before the plane crash that killed them, the connection between Peter's father, Richard Parker, with Norman Osborne and why he had to abandon his son in the care of his uncles Ben and May, as much as they didn't want to. Finally, Peter - and the audience, of course - has many of the answers to the mysteries he has always sought to unravel since he was a child. Her relationship with Aunt May (Sally Field) is also more interesting, with her aunt wanting to protect the boy from the events of the past concerning Peter's parents, whom she believes to be the truth about what had happened. This unbridled desire for Peter to know the truth about his parents' past also causes jealousy in May, who does not want to see his boy suffer.However, the way of approaching the villains was once again the major narrative problem. Even though he has been on the production team since the first trilogy led by Sam Raimi, it seems that Avi Arad and Kevin Feige did not learn much from the initial trilogy. Again, the producers and director Marc Webb try to put several villains and interconnect them in a single story, but just as in ""Spider-Man 3"" - which brought together Areia Sand, the new Green Goblin and Venom - the script does not convince and tries to get just an excuse to join the greatest number of threats possible in a single film, without developing any of the characters.Theoretically being the main villain of the film - which even gives the film its name - Max Dillon (Electro does not pass the image of a great threat until near the end. Played by Oscar winner Jamie Foxx, the character is presented as a brilliant scientist, who developed a plant alone for Oscorp, but who is a rejected person, without friends and who has always been invisible to everyone and who puts on a pedestal anyone who gives him a little more attention or who makes him feel special. Living like that alone made him an extremely unstable person. The point is that Electro's motivations are not credible. The fact that Spider-Man paying attention to him has already made him venerate the hero, even when the Spider doesn't recognize him anymore transformed after the genetic alteration he had suffered after the accident at Oscorp, it is enough for him to become his enemy. Not to mention that he is easily defeated in the fight in the middle of Times S quare and only reappears in the final act when allying with another character.Harry Osborne appears after studying at a boarding school at the age of 11. Rejected by his father and destined to suffer from the same genetic inheritance as his family, the heir of Oscorp Industries returns to see his father Norman (Chris Cooper) practically on his deathbed and starts trying to get the blood of Spider-Man, who could use to search for a cure for your degenerative disease and save your own life. Harry is presented as arrogant, ambitious and doubtful. His father's abandonment and rejection shaped that boy into what he became. Peter's old childhood friend and having helped him when the boy had lost his parents in the past, the two meet again and resume the friendship relationship. The two support each other, as they consider themselves as two rejected, abandoned by their parents. This relationship could have been much better developed, but Harry's vindictive attitudes occur extremely quickly, as well as his transformation into the Green Goblin - with a much better look than that presented in the first trilogy. The villain appears out of nowhere, attacks the hero out of nowhere, loses easily and then disappears, to resurface in the end allied to the mysterious Mr. Fear, in another moment of pure confusion. Despite the good performance of Dane DeHaan, the abrupt form of changes that occurred with the character, are negative points. DeHaan's Green Goblin would deserve an entire film as the main character, so that it could be fully explored.To make matters worse, they still managed to fit in a third villain, Rino (Paul Giamatti), who appears in the first and last scene of the film. The great visual surprise of the film has mere seconds to show its best shape. The character only served to show the audience fans of the comics, what the villain's look would be like in real life. Giamatti, who is an excellent actor, does not have any space to develop the villain.The director Marc Webb bets again on the direction of actors and proved to be competent again both in the action scenes with his camera always very well positioned to bring the best angle to the audience, especially when she passes for the heroes of the arachnid. Despite very well constructed scenes, the feeling we have is that more impactful scenes were lacking. Highlight for the fight sequence between Electro and Spider-Man in Times Square - the electrocuted handrail with the highlight - and the entire final sequence at the Oscorp plant between Spider-Man and the two villains. As in the previous film, the visual effects are incredible. We can also notice a greater number of comedy scenes. In addition to the chemistry with Emma Stone, Garfield is even more comfortable with the character. The Spider looks like he's out of the comics. The attitudes of the Friend of the Neighborhood are perfect. In the fight against villains we have the playful Spider, practically dancing with the enemies.The soundtrack was composed this time by Hans Zimmer, replacing James Horner, the composer of the first film. Marc Webb and Zimmer formed a supergroup with Williams, Johnny Marr, Mike Einziger and Eurythmics, David A. Stewart, to create the music for the sequel. Eventually, Stewart did not participate in the film's music, and the supergroup, credited as The Magnificent Six (in reference to the Sinister Sextet) helped Zimmer in the compositions.However, Spectacular Spider-Man 2 is again a lesser adventure than it could be. It lacked the old lesson of ""less is more"" to guarantee a feature film in its total efficiency and with fewer questions that invalidate its potential. In the face of this gigantism and the poor choice in the subplots to be addressed, The Spectacular Spider-Man 2 is stuck for much of its narrative. The film only thrills once and for all in the beginning and also in the final stretch, when it gains apotheotic airs. It's time for the special effects show, the exciting battles and a good dose of courage, to the delight of those who know the story of the arachnid hero in the comics. Fun, well done and well acted, but with script problems, Spectacular Spider-Man 2 has great chances of repeating the success of the previous film.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

spidey 2  - surprisingly good.,"Being not a fan of the spiderman movies - for me aimed at at kids and teenagers of which i am not - I found this movie to be a bit of an unexpected treat.Viewed it last night at a 3d preview in edinburgh and what i worried might be a bum numbing 2 and a half hours actually flew by.Don't want to give any spoilers or ruin any story but the whole pace of this film is much tighter than previous efforts and the tone can be quite dark at times. There is of course love interest but this added to the story and I actually bought into it and found myself caring for the characters, no mean feat for a cynic like me. Thankfully it didn't come across all teen/twilighty which seems to be the norm these days.The villains are very good, Dane DeHaan in particular is exceptional (is it me or does he remind you of a young Leo di Caprio?) and gives a fantastically unnerving performance - big things beckon for him no mistake.If you liked the previous Spiderman movies you'll still love this, If you didn't put any misgivings aside and give it a whirl (as i did). Either way definitely go and see this film, words I never thought I'd utter about a Spiderman movie. You Won't be disappointed.As I said - no plot details and no spoilers, just an honest opinion of my film experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Watch out Disney, Sony have upped their game!","In 2012 we got to see a reboot of Spider-Man's story, in my opinion it was better than the original trilogy and I love Andrew Garfield in the role. Now two years later we have a sequel and boy does it get better. First off let's talk cast; Andrew is still fantastic as Peter Parker, he also has great chemistry with Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey. Jamie Fox as Electro was an amazing thing to watch too along with the other great cast members who all do a fantastic job (even Stan Lee with his cameo). The characters in this film were actually really interesting to watch, a lot of the story focuses on Electro and his origin which is fascinating, plausible (sci-fi wise) and downright creepy, I mean creepy; this film goes to places I wasn't expecting; some of the scenes were real freaky to watch, especially Electro and certainly the Green Goblin who was nightmarish to say the least. What added to the creepy and tension had to be the music, the music in this film is phenomenal; there are so many good parts where the music goes perfectly with the beautiful shots that the movie gives you. Talking about the score itself, whenever Electro does his thing and fires electric bolts and everything they go real heavy on the dubstep, a lot, I think that adds to film though in some way, I enjoyed it. The story itself I really liked as well, the ways they went surprised me a few times but were definitely fun to watch, (I didn't see it in 3D but from the scenes I saw at the cinema it would definitely be worth it). The only negative thing I would say about the film is that there are one or unrealistic scenes where I thought ""That wouldn't happen"", It doesn't ruin the movie but does take you out of it for a few seconds. I would say the ending will surprise a lot, and for more than just one reason. In conclusion I want to say The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the best Spider-Man film to date and is absolutely AWESOMENESS.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing? No... But In terms of a No. 2 - Spot On!,"It was a cold February evening back in 2010. I was walking my dogs in the rangers and it was quite a frosty day FYI so the ground was quite damp and wet. Now as I was walking I slipped and as I did I fell into a pile of dog crap. This wasn't some Poodle's doing were talking about, I'm talking Great Dane business. Maybe it was the frost but it was also quite soggy itself. So not a pleasant experience and I had to walk back home smelling of this dog dung, with my dignity and humility gone.Amazing Spiderman 2 makes that dog crap seem like a Thornton's Chocolate Layer Cake. I mean that with 100% absolute honesty. I just want to say I remember seeing the first Amazing Spiderman thinking this really is as bad as it gets. But boy oh boy did they prove me wrong.You know how you look at things and think how in God's name did you get there. I call this 'the Trump effect'. Amazing Spiderman 2 epitomises this effect - as I was watching the film I was thinking, how did they manage to raise $200 million dollars to finance this film project and that was the result. $200 million! 200 MILLION! Let that sink in for a moment. that's real money right there spent on the film you have watched. (I would hit myself but I'm saving it for something worthwhile later).And like Trump, while I sat and watched this film shocked at its absurdity I had to sit there and think this is so ridiculous its sadly become enjoyable. I mean when you jump of a building onto a bicycle with no seat, you can either a) Experience the pain and agony or b) Think 'you know what this is a pretty funny situation.' Perhaps I should start with the beginning.1)We meet Jamie fox's character. A troubled individual with poor social skills who only wants to be recognised by his Hero Spiderman (I'll give the writers originality points for that). Spiderman saves Jamie and they have a cute bonding session for his birthday. Now we saw the trailer so I know he becomes this 'Electro' character and I was wondering how they were going to pull him off. So I was awe when I realised that the character become Electro by falling into a pool of eels. Now I don't know about you but I know a middle finger when I see one, and Jamie Fox falling into an Eel tank takes the cake. Electro then goes on a mini rampage and Spiderman comes to the rescue but forgets Jamie's character's name. The most obvious human reaction to this event would of course be for Electro to start destroying Time Square with electrical currents and suddenly turning on Spiderman who used to be his long life hero. So lesson number 1, if you ever meet someone emotionally unstable who has accidentally fallen into an eel tank giving the person super human abilities to supply and take in electrical currents. dear god remember their name.2)Next the side plot Airplane collision scene. The clever writers of this film in their storyboard room decided 'you know what this film needs, a completely unrelated incident were two airplanes are about to collide during Spiderman's big battle with Electro – because you know what we can'. Slaps forehead*.3)And now Andrew Garfield. Very fitting name for someone who has the acting capability in this film to that of an orange cat. I mean the kid makes me root for the two planes to crash. Also, the actor has as much charisma as a Lidl's Weetabix and the fact he landed this role really sums up the experience. Lesson number 2/ You apparently don't need to act in an acting role.I could go on ladies and gents but frankly I don't have the time. But in short is the Amazing Spiderman 2 worthwhile? Let me sum that up with a quote from the film.'No'.No one wanted a new Spiderman reboot. We got one. No one wanted a second sequel of that reboot. We got one. At least now we can know that hopefully the producers have learnt their lesson to maybe leave a longer gap between the original films and a new reboot.I mean what are they going to do know? Reboot a Reboot? It makes me chuckle just thinking of the ideaoh wait.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Great Romance Flick, Not the Greatest Action Film","Don't get me wrong, I loved this movie but something was missing to make it the ultimate Spidey movie (and it was definitely not an absence of Sony product placement). First off I would like to congratulate Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield's on-screen chemistry. It was to say the least adorable and true, which is what made this movie a great romance flick rather than an action film that we all paid to see.Garfield's portrayal of the loud mouthed web head we all know and love was a huge step up from the first of the series (which is saying a lot as I'm a sucker for origin stories). The perfect balance of cocky script writing and believable teenage actions made for a great portrayal of Peter Parker and allowed for a fun movie experience. I loved the new suit which paid homage to the old comics which was a nice treat for all you spiderfans out there and ultimately it made the fight scenes seem almost 'too comic' but who's to say that's a bad thing anyway. As for the new 'Baddies', they where good, but not great. I will run through each of them and give my opinions on each;Electro~~ The CGI was fantastic! Despite the original worry that they cast a black actor to play an originally white character Jamie Foxx pulled it and played a very convincing villain. I say villain because his portrayal of the innocent Max Dillon was strange, but kind of good in retrospect.Harry Osborne~~ Although my first impressions of the pictures released where negative, after watching his portrayal of the conflicted and isolated millionaire kid I would say his performance was on par to that of Garfield himself. He made me think, he made me worry and at one point he even made me hate the web-slinger.Rhino~~ For me, Rhino was just there rather than part of the 'enemies unite' team. His character lacked development and in terms of story he just jumped from one to another without really any backingFor a fan of Spider-man in both mediums of comic and cinema this movie was not perfect but it did not disappoint either, it's 100% worth the watch and is the best of the spider-man movies yet. 8.4 stars out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Shabby Spider-Man 2,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is more of the same from director Marc Webb. It's a good thing that I didn't pay to see it. Because of the film's marketing campaign and the trailers I was, for some time, looking forward to seeing this sequel. But what I saw was almost as bland and unengaging as The Amazing Spider-Man (2012). As was the case with the first film, the trailers for the sequel made it seem much better than it actually is. It's a cheat in a way. One of the three supervillains in the trailers isn't even an important character in the film. All the action scenes in the film were featured in the trailers. Yes, there's a shortage of action. The actions scenes are few and far between. There's also nothing particularly impressive about them. Director Sam Raimi did the same thing a decade earlier and he did it much better. In addition he made the action scenes lengthy, something that Webb still isn't capable of doing. But Webb's inexperience (or is it a lack of talent?) is evident not only in the action. It's evident in the way he directs actors. We've heard enough about Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone being a couple. But does this make a difference in the film? It makes little difference really. The featured romance is typical for a superhero film. It makes you feel little for the couple, something that becomes much too obvious during an important scene. The screenplay by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci and Jeff Pinkner doesn't impress. At times it's poorly written. It doesn't help the romance or the proceedings. It doesn't make the characters interesting. It's formulaic. It contains unnecessary parts. These parts are a burden on the film's running time, which is 2 hours and 22 minutes. Yet we still get two underdeveloped and unmemorable supervillains. We get to know their motivations but we don't really get to know anything else about them. This is a fault of the screenplay. Jamie Foxx (Electro) and Dane DeHaan (Green Goblin) don't provide good performances with Webb's direction. In fact, the performances and even the film itself seem cartoonish at times. Also, for a film with such a large budget ($255 million), the CGI looks surprisingly underdeveloped in some scenes. There's just a lack of style in these Spider-Man movies by Marc Webb. If it wasn't for Andrew Garfield playing Peter Parker it would have been a chore to sit through this film. It's not all bad though. Sometimes the actors manage to brighten up a scene. There are some genuinely funny audience-friendly bits. A good electronic score by Hans Zimmer & The Magnificent Six is a bit of an improvement over James Horner's orchestral score for the first film. But at a time when Marvel and Disney are releasing one solid superhero film after another this aimless Spider-Man reboot by Columbia seems primitive. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is only a minor improvement over the first film. Take my advice and don't see it in a movie theater. Don't get duped for a second time.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A really good Spider-Man film,"I really enjoyed this film. The first film came under some criticism especially by lovers of Raimi's trilogy, but I felt it took the necessary steps to redefine the character and it gives the sequel a solid platform to build on.The casting and performances of both Andrew Garfield as Spider-man and Dane Dahaan as Harry Osbourne are particular triumphs of this instalment. I also think Emma Stone does a good job.The Action sequences are exciting and are visually spectacular where they particularly succeed in showcasing Spiderman's powers.I've read some reviews complaining how this film is too much of a romantic flick, but ultimately the relationship between Peter and Gwen is key to the story and adds a much needed dimension to the standard Superhero movie. In fact these interactions between the two characters stand out as some of the best acting performances throughout film.So overall this is a good watch and I'd definitely recommend anyone to go check it out, my only real problem with it was some of the creative choices surrounding Jamie Foxx's character, especially in his characters normal form.But other than that go see it!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Finally!!! A good spiderman movie!!!,"I was really surprised after watching this movie! Not only was the VFX extremely good, but the plot was also awesome and detailed. They show you that; spiderman is a human, he can't save everyone, without making enemies. Everyone was good in this movie, even police officers were good in this movie. I feel that Marc Webb (the director) has learned from his mistakes, no more wannabe spidey, no more trying to funny! And finally, finally, we learn more about his parents. The story is realistic, if you think about it in a superhero movie perspective. They show you the sad part of spiderman's story, they show you the phycology of spidey and almost all the enemies. The vfx are really impressing too, I even think there could might be a Oscar nomination for it.The ending was too fast though, they had the chance to stop it at the right time. But instead they overworked it. There were some parts of the movie, where they tried to be funny, even though it wasn't.... But all and all, the movie was awesome and epic.

Potential not realized,"The story and plot had potential that was not completely realized. The action was good - 8 - liked the POV/First person shots and camera moves. The acting was modest - 6.5. The character's dialogue was pretty good most of the time, witty, sharp - 7 but when it failed it was a 2, and it failed at critical times. The dialogue (and acting) really fell short during the dramatic emotional scenes. A lot of close-ups and teary-eyed emotional scenes that hit the same note and seemed trite. The characters said exactly what they thought, spilling their guts with no subtlety -- dialogue was too head on. The characters ultimately came off as shallow. The story got long and seemed to wander at the end becoming as much about setting up the next movie as satisfying it's potential. More time could have been spent making the characters compelling. It was soap opera acting/dialogue/story with top-shelf Hollywood special effects. Not enough for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Completely devoid of thought,"This movie is horrendous! Marc Webb should've done a lot better with this movie because he's a good director, but for whatever reason, he was just sleeping through this terrible movie. I didn't care of the first Amazing Spider-Man but wow, this film makes that film look like The Dark Knight! Everything about this film is wrong. Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. The is no plot to this movie, just like 9 ministries cobbled together randomly and none of them intertwine or mesh at all. The tone constantly goes back and fourth between loltastic comedy and dark drama/thriller, and it makes no sense. The performances are all dreadful, starting with Jaimie Foxx (yah, a buff black guy as a dweeby nerdy scientist, I bet Vin Diesel was their second choice) and then Dane Dehaan and then Andrew Garfield himself. The music is so damn grating, like whose bright idea was it to put dialog in the musical score...WHILE the characters in the film are talking? There are moments where both the musical score is talking and the characters are talking and they overlap each other. It's awful! Electro is a dumb villain with a dumb motive that isn't even really clear (so, he's made that Spider-Man forgot his name? Now he wants to destroy the world? WHAT?) Rhino is completely wasted (also, Paul Giamatti as a gangster is hilariously bad) and Oscorp has no meaning in the film. The dialogue is horrendous too; half of the lines are said twice in a row for some reason (""I'm going to work, I'm going to work!"") and one of the worst lines ever is when Emma Stone says ""I break up with you"" like a caveman. Spider-Man himself is also extremely annoying. Like the minute long sequence of him arguing with his aunt about...laundry? Oh, and don't forget, this is the ""dark"" and ""serious"" Spider-Man, which is why we have scenes with Parker arguing about laundry or Spider-Man pulling down Rhino's pants...oh yeah, that's dark and gritty all right!

The BEST Spider-Man so far,"After re-watching this film, I have lowered my rating from 10 to 7. I believe I was caught up in the hype and now that I have rewatched, its not that great lol. My original review below.I watched the movie in 3D on opening night. I was not sure what to expect as some of the critic reviews I had read were not so flattering. However, within the first 10 minutes of the movie I was hooked.Visually, this is the most realistic and fluid Spider-Man film yet. All of the movements and actions are exactly as if you would imagine if you ever read any of the comics or watched the CLASSIC Spider-Man cartoon in the 90's.I was especially glad that the web swinging was realistically designed, as you were shown which buildings the web is sticking to and how it affects Spider-Mans trajectory as he swings through the air.The Acting was top notch. I think Andrew Garfield is the best version of Peter Parker we will ever see. He is a perfect fit for the character and his chemistry with Emma Stone is amazing. The only character that really annoyed me was Norman Osborn. He was, how can I best put it, a Wanksta!The Story was more about Spidey and Gwen Stacy, rather than the villains. I understand that this may have not appealed to some fans. However, this is exactly what Spider-Man is about. Spider-Man is about a regular guy with regular guy problems, which cause him just about as much pain as his work as a superhero.In fact, Spider-Man is more comfortable with fighting super villains on a daily basis than dealing with his past and relationships. Unlike other superheros, what makes Spider-Man so unique is that he is a regular guy who nobody knows about.He ,akes ends meat as a photographer, lives at home with his aunt and has to support her, has a complicated relationship with his friends/girlfriend and has to juggle all this while fighting crime on a daily basis. Spider-Man provides a unique experience from both the view of a civilian as well as a hero.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Sony give Spiderman back to Marvel.,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a classic case for why Sony should return the rights to Spider-Man back to Marvel.When Marvel do a movie with their list of characters they do it with a reverence to their comic based history.

"Pacing Issues, Unbalanced and off.","I went into this film with high expectations. I enjoyed the first one more than I thought I would have, as well as the trailers for this movie really had my attention going. Sadly, this movie is no where near as good as the first film and felt like it was directed by someone completely different.The worst thing about this film is the pacing. Something about the flow of the movie was just wrong and off. Some scenes went on for way too long, I'm talking about 20 minutes of just straight up chatter of non related topics that do not contribute to the film's storyline at all. The next scene would then be a 30 second clip of something interesting, and then it would cut back to scenes that actually bored me. Even the action scenes were paced so poorly. I can't find the exact word for it, but the only word I can think of is weird when it comes to the action. Don't get me wrong, the visual effects look great and the cinematography is great also (way more colorful and bright than the first film) but nothing in the action feels natural. I was never on the edge of my seat on any of the action sequences. Even the last action that was supposed to be the final climax action set piece had me feeling empty. The structure of this movie was just messy and all over the place, and on some parts, very boring to watch.Andrew Garfield I felt was not as strong in this film as he was in the first film. Its not so much his acting, but the script he was given. All he does is cry or look like he's about to cry, and the dialog scenes that he has with anyone (even Gwen) is super dooper cheesy and un-natural. Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborne was good, but not as spectacular as everyone says he is. He was particularly strong towards the final act of the film. Jamie Foxx was a weird one for me. I couldn't tell if his acting was poor, or if what he was told to do was poor. Before he became Electro, his scenes were off as hell. Too rushed, too many quick cuts and just unbalanced (which as I said before is pretty much the entire film). The reason of why he suddenly becomes a villain I found was just stupid. One second he's totally obsessed with spider-man and the next he wants to kill him... Ummmm...huh? One of the few things that was good about Electro (or Max Dillon) is that you sympathise for him at first and you feel sorry for him because he gets treated like horse crap. But all that connection is lost as soon as the times square showdown sequence happens. The best performance is still Emma Stone (Gwen Stacy). She's always good, but as I said before, the dialog in this movie is off, which does affect her performance on a small scale.Another big thing that ruined the movie for me was the music. The trailers made it seem like this truly was spider-man's ultimate battle because of the music (especially the music towards the end of the final trailer). What do we get instead? Dubstep, party music (Project X stuff) and music that seems like it would belong on the Disney channel. Whenever there's an action sequence, the music completely ruins the tone of the fight making it so much more less intense than it should have been. And since Hans Zimmer was composing the score, I expected it to be intense orchestral hybrid pieces. If he were to compose a score that would sound something like inception's, then I could see that capturing the tone of the film (particularly the action sequences).A few things I actually like about the film: The opening scene was amazing. I thought that by watching the opening scene, this movie would top all of the other Spiderman movies. Sadly I was wrong. The action as I said before is cool to watch. Everything is very colorful, and the visual effects aren't the realistic type in lets just say Captain America: The Winter Soldier or Man of Steel. Its the cartoony comic book style type of visual effects (sort of like 300's) which is great for this type of movie. I also like how they don't over do the slow motion in the movie. It was used when it was needed the most and it looked great.All and all, this film felt like it was directed by Michael Bay. It had that weird, off, quick cut, rushed, forced and messy pace but had great visual effects just like Transformers 2 and 3. This isn't a terrible film, but its not good either. If you want to watch this movie for the action, then you're in for a treat. However, you will need to get through the clunky dialog, bad pacing, okay acting, rushed villain origin stories and a generic storyline. In total, there is probably only around 30-40 minutes of action which means you will need to get through the 90 to 100 minutes of everything else.5/10 - Mediocre",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Decent sequel with mature tone & listless story, but excellent (shocking) final act","Released in 2014 and directed by Marc Webb, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" stars Andrew Garfield as the troubled, but likable hero with spider powers who struggles with relationship issues with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and battles Electro (Jamie Foxx), a humble electrical engineer transformed into a living electric generator. Dane DeHaan is also on hand as Harry Osborn, who has a startling transformation of his own. Sally Field plays Aunt May while Felicity Jones appears as Felicia.It's best to watch the first film before this one because some story elements transfer over. It features the same main cast and has the same tone, so if you liked that one you'll probably like this sequel. Thankfully, they fixed Spider-Man's costume, noticeably the mask & eyes. While I like the mature, sometimes reverential tone, the story feels listless, particularly the part revolving around Electro (which is thoroughly changed from the comics). Foxx is fine; I just found the character, as written, uninteresting. Ditto with the other convoluted subplot. DeHaan works better as the second villain (I'm not going to say who, but it's obvious if you know anything about Spider-Man).Thankfully, everything perks up in the final act where the creators do something bold. I didn't think they'd do it and found it almost shocking, although they didn't milk it for it's potential (but they did well enough). Even the Rhino shows up.The movie runs 142 minutes and was shot in New York (The City, Rochester & Long Island) and Los Angeles.

Not as bad as others say!,"I think this film is quite underrated. It's not as good as the Spider-Man films with Tobey Maguire or Tom Holland, but it's better than its predecessor. The actors all portray the characters well, though it does get morose at times. Jamie Foxx does surprisingly well in his role considering it is not his usual type of character. It is definitely a new interpretation of the franchise. However, I can understand the complaint that it is too long and combines too many storylines in one. They could have cut it down, especially that Russian rhino guy at the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Entertaining but not amazing,"My biggest gripe of the first film was that it felt too much as a rehash of the original Raimi spiderman film so I assumed the second one would be much better because it had the chance to form it's own story and universe, instead of closely following the storyline of previous films. And yes it was better than the first film but was it "" amazing""? No, not yet.The biggest fear I had was that it would had too many villains and story lines and I was partly right ( however it was not as bad as I thought it would be). Sony just wants to build its universe as quick as possible and set up as many story lines as possible but it's going too fast in my opinion. To build an natural superhero universe it takes time and effort. Don't try to cram too much into one film.The best thing about the film are the performances of the leads. I adore the chemistry between Garfield and Stone. Stone shines as Gwen Stacy and she is one of my favourite parts of the new films. Jamie Foxx and Dane Dehaan were also great in their roles. Giamatti was a bit too much over the top but he was fun too watch.The pace and tone felt a bit uneven. At times was the film even a bit corny ( but I guess that's the tone of the comics so I can live with that). The film was a bit too long and I would have like to seen more Electro ( his powers were awesome) and to take a little more time to develop the story of the green goblin ( perhaps span it over a couple of films). I personally would have cut Goblin out of the film ( not Osborn, just his transformation), added more Electro and cut a few scenes.( Another note I would like to make is the weird use of the music: the music was really well done and sometimes even creepy,like during the appearances of Electro. Almost every time there was some dubstep along with Electro so that was really weird but it had an epic feel. Oh yeah , the music during the end credits didn't fit with the tone of the film)7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A really, really good film","I personally thought this was an excellent film. It had a good amount of comedy, truly deep emotions, and brilliant action. A great, cohesive film to lead on from the first one.The relationship between the two main characters are brilliant, and you can really understand what's going on between them as both actors portray their characters very well.Also, what I like from these movies are that they are more relative to the Spider-man comic books, compared to the Spider-man Trilogy (and let's be honest, they were terrible.) If you have read the comic books, then you'll understand where I'm coming from when you see this movie.The only downside/s I feel this movie has is that Jamie Foxx, in my opinion, doesn't really fit his character and I felt that he didn't really have a massive say in the whole film, it was more about the other villain - but what I did like is that having two villains didn't make it feel like there was too much going on; it was very understandable and a pleasurable viewing experience, so the director receives points in my book for his story telling.This review is really brief as I don't want to sway your opinion on the film before you've watched it, but rather to change your opinion on whether you should watch it, and I believe that you definitely should.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This wasn't really impressive...,"I can't really claim to be fan of the superhero genre, and this who reboot thing with ""Spiderman"" didn't sit well with from from the previous movie, and it was with some reluctance that I sat down to watch ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"".This is first and foremost an effects movie, as the CGI overshadows the rest of the movie, especially with its lukewarm storyline.The villains in the movie were almost non-existing, and what little on-screen time they had, they were far from being utilized to the fullest of their potential. And that made for a somewhat below average experience, because these villains could have added so much more to the movie.I didn't get that whole fake teeth thing that was going on with the Max Dillon character, especially when you could see Jamie Foxx's real teeth through the fake teeth in the upper mouth. It was just horrible to witness.And one thing that also made this movie less than mediocre for me was the usage of comedy throughout the movie. It was just so misplaced and it didn't work out at all with the rest of the movie.Truth be told, then Tobey Maguire actually pulled off the spider-man character better than this new guy in these two movies, Andrew Garfield.Well, I have seen it now, and thus can scratch it off the ""not watched yet"" list. And I can honestly say that I will not be making a return trip to this particular movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
great chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone,"Peter Parker's father Richard (Campbell Scott) was a scientist working on a secret project. While Peter was a child, Peter's parents were attacked on a plane killing them but not before he was able to upload a computer file. Peter (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) are graduating from high school. However it's getting too dangerous and he breaks up with her. Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) is a lowly electrical engineer working at Oscorp. He gets electrocuted and bitten by an electric eel becoming Electro. Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) returns home to take over from his dying father as CEO of Oscorp and eventually becomes Green Goblin. Felicia (Felicity Jones) was his father's assistant and now is Harry's. Donald Menken (Colm Feore) is Oscorp vice-president. At the end, Russian gangster Aleksei Sytsevich (Paul Giamatti) is turned into Rhino.Everything is so choppy. It's like the movie needed to hit so many specific plot points. The movie has no flow. The plot developments keep coming and coming without letting the characters breathe. The best part by far is the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. The movie is better every time they are together on the screen. Without them, I would definitely fail this because this is generally a mess. Jamie Foxx is being a ridiculous cartoon as Max Dillon. As Electro, he's much better. Dane DeHaan is very good but Green Goblin is completely rushed. Again the movie is jamming so much into this. Also I don't know why people keep hanging around to watch as chaos ensues. Electro is wrecking Time Square and people are gathered around to cheer like it's New Year's Eve. There are so many ideas going on like Peter's parents and corporate intrigue. There is enough material for two movies and would probably be better as that.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Much better than Garfield's first attempt,As a huge fan of the original Spiderman trilogy with Tobey Maguire I remember watching the reboot with Andrew Garfield and being far from impressed. I wished they never rebooted and just continued with Maguire under the suit.But TASM:2 opens up with a universe far more dense than the reboot let on in the first movie. The second attempt gets finally seems to get things right with Spiderman's style and attitude - true to the comic. Another thing worth noting is that his suit is now more believable considering you can see it ripple in the wind as he swings along the city; a vast improvement from the obvious CGI with Tobey Maquire. Garfield also seems to have beefed up this time around (definitely needed to enable him to portray someone capable of throwing a punch!).The movie runs quite long and they cram a lot into it - this has been criticised by a few but is something I rather enjoyed. If you ever watched the cartoon series you will enjoy this movie.,8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I am so amazed with this movie I truly am, because I was so disappointed after the first part that I had little hope about this movie and I went to cinema to see how bad it would be and I felt so good and glad when it ended.

The film drags on and on,"This film tells the story of Peter Parker having to struggle between his love life, his quest for what happened to his parents, and saving New York city from crime.""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" spends so much time on emotional elements, developing relationships with Gwen, the aunt and even Harry Osborn. The result is that it spends literally hours on cumbersome dialogs, and there is hardly any action. When I watch a summer blockbuster, I expect lots of action and thrills. In ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" there is almost none of that. There are only two battle scenes, and believe it or not, I was yawning even in the middle of the supposed final epic showdown.""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is just far too long.

Exceeded my Expectations,"I am a huge fan of Spider-man and the first two Spider-man films are one of my favourite films. I was angry when I didn't get a Spider-man 4 but instead got a reboot. While The Amazing Spider-man was decent its main flaw was being a rehash of the first film. But the Amazing Spider-man 2 has the advantage of not being an origin story. This film is truly spectacular. I do not agree with the critics at all about this one. This film continues to tie up 'untold story' TASM was supposed to conclude. Acting by DeDehan, Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield are top-notch. The Action Scenes and Spidey swinging are Visually Stunning, especially in 3-D. The final action scene was intense and had my heart racing.Electro and Harry Goblin were creepy villains. Electro seemed like Dr. Manhattan (teleporting and disintegrating) and his motivations were somewhat weak, IMO but I consoled myself that he did what he did because he was crazy. My main problem is with the trailers as they showed the entire Rhino fight scene in the trailers and 70-80% of the Goblin fight scene.The trailers were badly put as they spoiled many things. If Rhino wasn't in the trailer or poster at all, I would have been surprised and excited about him in the film. Even though his role works fine in the context of the film. While I don't think it's better than the first two Raimi films. Its pretty close.My rating: 8.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Garfield's Taunts are as funny as the ones from cartoons provocative and witty, managing to find a sweet spot in my heart.Emma Stone as lovely as ever, not only steals Peter's heart but also holds our own in her hands with her cuteness and independent personality, her courage and intelligence.The combat in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is incredible, it feels fluid and natural, and the special effects stamps this experience in our brain, feeling that 2 hours and 22 minutes are not enough for this grandeur masterpiece of Super Heroes and Super Villains!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Great characters and story, but there were minor issues. **SPOILER FREE","The Amazing Spiderman 2 was a good film. Personally, I am a fan of Spiderman and I enjoyed this film. Here is what I liked about the film: 1) The action was very good and I enjoyed the way they filmed it. In addition, Spiderman swinging around the city was great, especially since they made him interact with the environment and people a lot, thus making the film seem more realistic, instead of having him just focus on the main plot. In addition, the conflicts in the plot were very good. I didn't expect the characters to develop that well, but they did and by linking the villains conflicts together (through Oscorp) the villains stories were very well put. However, the Green Goblin didn't get that much screen time.I would like to point out that I think that the final fight with Electro was great and suspenseful, but his defeat wasn't that great. The goes with Rhino, who seemed very unnecessary throughout the entire plot. Also, there was lots of CGI used which would usually remove interest from a film, but since it was Electro, the CGI made sense. In addition, the new theme made by Hans Zimmer was good, but it was constantly played during every Spiderman scene, which got annoying. The same goes with the constant dubstep played for Electro.Another negative factor I would like to point out is the abundance of humour. There was a lot of comedy in the film, which was good and placed, but sometimes there was too much humour. However, the film was also very dark and violent which I liked (especially with the fight between The Green Goblin and Spiderman).Thirdly, the final negative point about this film was the ending. They usually had an inspirational speech of some sort (which was there, but wasn't the main focus in the end), instead they chose to add a poor conflict in, instead of a ""final swing"" like the other films.In summary, the film was good, with well times humour and dark moments. The plot was very good, and 2/3 villains had very good plots which interlocked well, creating a great set of villains. However, there were a large group of characters introduced, and a few too many plots which was a lot to work with, but nothing to effect the film in a big way. The filming was great, and the action and plot was very well put together, creating a unique storyline.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Aiming For Big,"Apparently, there hasn't been an actual epic Spider-Man movie. The very first one back in 2002 is obviously a humble beginning, the second is more of an existential experiment, the third is basically a series of soap operatic subplots that happens to be a blockbuster, and finally the reboot is a nearly down-to-earth coming-of-age film about an angsty teenager who finds himself as a superhero. In this latest installment, based on the infinite amount of trailers, it is supposed to be the biggest of the bunch. Because sequels are always suppose to be big. But surprisingly, it is not even close to the expected scale. A more appropriate word to describe it is manipulation. The film instead displays itself with serious, challenging conflicts that mostly end up as cliffhangers. They're not bad, it just feels like it cheated the audience for something more.In spite that it's the longest Spider-Man movie so far, there isn't much big happening on screen. The questions the story asks sure are, but the narrative just juggles off the subplots with contrivance which results as underwhelming. There is no actual straighter point. Stretching it with that runtime just made it kind of exhausting. It also scatters with a lot of potential themes. This is usually the specialty of these movies, no matter how good or weak the movie can be, the central message is always clear, but here the sentiments get a little shakier. The script probably just wants to focus more on the superhero elements, but the plot itself wanted to reserve the bigger action later.The commitment of director Marc Webb is a huge benefit. Even with all the messy plotting and contrivance, he made those ridiculous turns look pretty natural. The romance between Peter and Gwen is still likable even though it sometimes become more of a priority for Peter than the real threat happening behind Oscorp. The action scenes are also better. The web swinging is a lot breathtaking and the fight scenes are surprisingly compelling. People might be focusing on the special effects and the cool slow-mos, but those aren't the real merits. Instead of long shots of massive explosions, it mostly concerns the normal citizens in danger, making the fights look more than personal. It's no groundbreaker to the genre of course, but at one point when some of them are about to die, it does feel like a big deal.The acting of the returning actors from the last one didn't change a bit, which is good. The new ones are fine. Jamie Foxx is fair as Electro, but the alter ego is what handicaps. Max Dillon appears to be a sociopath and that should make him terrifying, but instead he acts more like a buffoon. Better is Dane DeHaan, though the script disappointingly rushed the character to the dark side, but the actor balances Harry Osborn's both human and sinister personalities quite well. And in one killer scene of the uncredited appearance of Chris Cooper indicates that the movie should be ashamed for not giving him more screen time as Norman Osborn.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not yet the most epic Spider-Man ever. It's basically a busy sequel that hardly been anywhere, but even with all the pretentiousness of the story, the film can still provide genuine emotion and fortitude behind the action, the obvious dramas, and even in its most bombastic cliffhanger. The real letdown is it fails to promise the real deal, but even if it has a lot of action, the problems of the story are still too noticeable. The direction and acting are once again competent, the plot just needs consistency.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Intense, charming and electric","Great power doesn't just come with great responsibility but also at a great cost. Heroes deal with their painful pasts and yet rise to face the evil that can threaten the present day. It is their ability to overcome those personal battles in times when darkness looms over society, that makes them superheroes. In the follow-up to the reboot of Raimi's Spiderman trilogy, director Marc Webb (!) massively improvises upon the story's technological rendering and the human element of it that delineates the challenges of being a superhero for an ordinary man. Peter Parker's ability to overcome his fears, his childhood loss, his financial instability and relationship's complication is what really makes him the Amazing Spiderman and in its 2nd installment, his portrayal by Andrew Garfield outclasses any prior attempt. At the burden-heavy core of his responsibility web is Emma Stone's charming Gwen Stacy who is perhaps the most lovable superhero girlfriend yet.As Spiderman busies himself with crime prevention in the city, thus gaining popularity among its citizens, Peter Parker's personal struggles mount. Devoting time for his girlfriend and being there for her big moments is one challenge but visions of her deceased father warning him to keep her out of his harm's way is a decision that is taken by his destiny and not him. Meanwhile, Harry Osborne (Dan DeHaan) returns to his ailing father's death-bed to take over a device containing his life's work and his empire of OsCorp. The same illness however is detected in Harry and his only solution to a cure is blood transfusion from Spiderman. The hero's woes aren't over just yet. In a freak accident in a lab, Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) is submerged in a tank of genetically modified Eels that mutate him into 'Electro' – a living electric station that has the power to cause a massive blackout and use that energy against Spiderman. Parker soon realizes that all of his challenges have OsCorp in common and it is his father's hidden video feed that clarifies Norman Osborn's true intentions about the biogenetic projects. Spiderman must now face all his demons, take high volts of electricity thrown at him by Electro, combat the wrath of the goblin-glide rider Harry Osborn and keep Gwen away from imminent danger. A hero's strength will become his weakness and he will pay a price to be the savior of the city that he must protect.The action is frenetic at times and draws parallels with 'Man of Steel' where each sequence isn't elaborately explained but is delivered in its intense form directly. We all know the powers of Spiderman so the director doesn't waste time in how he goes about the action. The swinging scenes are better than ever at engaging the audience, the action is bigger and Spiderman's powers seem enhanced. The special effects truly come into play when portraying the destruction by Electro and yet, they simply aid the story and characters. The plot balances well between being a Superhero's struggle story and an all-out action duel.Dane DeHaan plays a sinister Harry Osborn with evil emanating from his expressions. Jamie Foxx 's innocent Max Dillon is then transformed into the CGI version that is Electro and Foxx is excellent in his powerful villain's character. As secrets that are buried in the past are revealed, Peter understands his purpose better and overcomes his challenges. Garfield's quirkiness works in his friendship with Harry, his vulnerability works with Aunt May and his ambivalence works with Gwen. In an all round performance, Garfield manages to out-swing The Amazing Spiderman's curse of being the 5th movie about the superhero in 12 years. Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy is the reason this film stands out beyond all the action and effects. Her charming portrayal of the young, ambitious and intelligent individual is such a far cry from Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane. Peter's fears raise complications between them while Gwen's confidence and charm bring them closer. The scene when they establish 'ground rules' after a break up can just make one fall in love with her as Peter did. Gwen's science degree makes her more of an understanding partner rather than just a romantic one and such chemistry makes them the best couple in a superhero film.Faced with an enemy far superior in powers, a complicated relationship shrouded in fear and a past remembered for its losses, the friendly neighborhood Spiderman must rise to live up to a role that every superhero embraces. Through the dark days that took over the city and through days he felt alone, what made our hero 'The Amazing Spiderman' was his ability to give hope to people...... and of course, how he can free fall from the tallest building's top and make us spend all that money on its 3D effect.8.234 on a scale of 1-10.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A waste of an actor born to play Spidey,"I'm a big fan of comics, particularly Marvel's characters and I grew up adoring Spiderman and most of the adaptations that have been made. The 90s animated series ruled, the Raimi trilogy made true the dream of a real action movie of the webhead but threw it all away in the final installment and this franchise..... just doesn't feel right to me.The main issue I have with Amazing Spiderman both 1 and 2 is that the writers seem to misinterpret the aspects of the hero and it's surroundings. Spidey comes out more silly and clowny than witty and sarcastic. He is annoying to the guys he's fighting like a mime can be annoying when you walk by him in the sidewalk and chooses to displayed all his talents for you to see, and that's just not the feeling I think this character should provoke. All that, added to the crowds cheering behind a police line while Spidey fights a villain makes it all too childish for my taste.What's really sad is that Andrew Garfield is the best Spiderman there is and will be. He has embodied the character amazingly and any shortcomings are due to the screenplay he's has to work with. Same goes to Emma Stone, a brilliant young actress that has returned dignity to our beloved Gwen Stacy after what Spiderman 3 did to her. Them and the greatly accomplished CGI scenes of Spidey's web swinging, which are what I've always thought that these scenes should look like, are the beautiful things about this movie that end up wasted in a context that doesn't do justice to a wonderful character and it's even more wonderful universe.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Just an Okay Spider-Man Movie,"In the follow up to 2012's reboot, The Amazing Spider-Man, we find Spider-Man on a journey to further figure out the mystery surrounding his parents' death, all the while going toe-to- toe with the new big bad guy in town, known as Electro.I'm gonna get straight to the point, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not as good as the other Spider-Man films, but it is a piece of popcorn entertainment that will entertain for most of it's two plus hour run time. However, as a fan, I cannot lie and say that I am not disappointed by this film, and as an amateur film critic, I have to be honest and point out how cluttered the film often feels.In all honesty, they just tried to pack too much into this one movie to try and set up future films and spin-offs, like Venom and The Sinister Six. There is not a clear focus to this film, unlike any of the other Spider-Man films. It's unclear as to what the filmmakers were actually trying to do here. Is it the story of Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy? Is it the story of how Spidey met Electro? Or is it the story of the Green Goblin? It's all of those things and a whole lot more, but there is never enough time devoted to any one of those story threads for them to feel fully fleshed out and satisfying on their own. I really think the culprit for all of this is in the Spidey producers trying to be like Marvel Studios and The Avengers.No longer can a superhero movie be simply a good standalone movie, and if that one is successful, they make another one with a similar, single-minded focus. Now, in the wake of the massive amount of cash The Avengers brought in, every superhero film franchise has to create this larger than life canvas of multiple films intersecting to create a larger story. While I love The Avengers, here's one of the things that Marvel Studios has done for almost all of their films, which The Amazing Spider-Man 2 did not do. They made every one of their superhero films good standalone films on their own right, and not just films that had to be seen in the larger context to be liked or understood. I mean, look at both of the Captain America movies. Take those away from the context of The Avengers, and they're phenomenal films irregardless, but add in the ingredient that is The Avengers, and you get super awesomeness. The thing is, the key is making one good film, and not placing so much focus on the future that you forget about the present. Of course, what really makes me feel conflicted here is that there are just a good many things that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 does right.Andrew Garfield is once again phenomenal as Spider-Man, and Emma Stone is even more lovable as Gwen Stacy (as if that was possible). The film truly shines in the romantic scenes between Stone and Garfield, particularly because those are the scenes, alongside the music montages, where it feels like director Marc Webb is most comfortable. There are moments where I see that spark from his music video work and (500) Days of Summer, and in the midst of all the spectacle and bombastic action, it is those moments that stuck with me more than anything else. Somewhere in the midst of all of the excess that this film has, there is a very innocent and true romance, and I think that is the real focus of this film, but it's often pushed aside for too long to develop something that may not pay off for another film or two. As a matter of fact, if the film was purely about Peter and Gwen's romantic woes and Electro, I'd have been a happier Spider-Man fan, because I really like what actor Jamie Foxx and the filmmakers did with Electro, alas he gets the shaft after about the first hour mark.Maybe I'm becoming a bit of a movie curmudgeon, but the more and more I analyze films, the more I realize, the simpler you often make the story, the better the film. While that may not always be the case, I think here, it is. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is just too bloated, feeling like three different films crammed into the run time of just one. While it is a film that you will have fun at, laugh at, and actually feel something at, it is not a great film, it's simply okay. I actually remember reading another review the other day where they said, had this film been made in the Nineties, it would be one of the best superhero movies ever made, but made now, when we have so many other top notch superhero films, many of which being other Spider-Man movies, it just pales in comparison. Even still, if you can accept that this is not the greatest Spider-Man film, you will enjoy yourself with The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which I did for at least three-fourths of this film, I just wish it had all tied together a little better.I give The Amazing Spider-Man 2 a 7 out of 10!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Its simple premise of one overcoming their crisis is emotionally captivating, effectively presented and thoroughly entertaining.","Swinging with high voltage visual effects and fantastic soundtracks, The Amazing Spider-Man 2: Rise of Electro perches above its peers. In a more video game or comic inspired illustration, the overall colorful tone works wonderfully, especially in larger scales fights such as in Times Square, it's baffling not many movies do battles in the famous location. Its multitude of talents does a great job in bringing the characters to life; chemistry between them is definitely present. Regardless of some flaws, narrative might get crowded sewing numerous plots and villains, the movie will most likely satisfy fans and casual viewers alike.The story tells origins of Electro and Green Goblin, played by Jamie Foxx and Dane DeHaan respectively, both of which have awkward relationship with the titular hero. Their stories are a bit foreshadowing, even more so to those who have knowledge of the comic or seen the previous trilogy and this might just be too predictable for some. Nevertheless the movie does a decent job on modernizing the villains and keeping them grounded without being too comical, it's a good choice not to put Electro in green yellow spandex. Jamie Foxx certainly has charisma for the main villain, although the fanatic aspect of the character in early parts is odd. It's a bit silly and too old-fashioned for an origin tale, he then becomes more appropriately menacing later on, partly due the blue CG face.Dane DeHaan is a suitable cast for Harry Osborn, I daresay even better than James Franco who previously donned the green cape. He's an eerie reminiscence of young Leonardo DiCaprio, even with similar hairdo. He takes the role of Harry into a darker more obsessed persona, one with volatile and conniving nature. Most of the movie is oriented in Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) as they struggle with emotion and passion. Both of them showcase personal touches; it's apparent that Garfield admirably tries to fill the protagonist role. Spider-Man is a closer more relatable superhero as he endures doubt, guilt, and even the things ordinary folks go through daily, Garfield plays to this strength pretty well. Props to Sally Field and Chris Cooper as parental figures, each the polar opposite of the other, complementing the hero and villain, respectively.Graphic differs from the usual gritty mainstream superhero flicks, New York is displayed in all its vibrant wonder. At first, it seems a tad close to video game, but I fancy the distinct feel. When the movie talks about hope aplenty, it helps to view the world in radiance. Action is great, often taking camera angles close to Spider-Man, slowing down just barely at the moment of impact. The use of audio matches pretty well, Hans Zimmer is a master in this regard. Many techno dubstep tracks focused on Electro blazing in the background and electrically pumping adrenaline, it may appear ludicrous at first, but it fits the movie brilliantly. Pop and rock songs litter the movie, played just in the right time. The production value is aggressive and undeniably entertaining.The story sadly may stutter throughout the movie, there are just too many angles to show. From the romance between the two, origins of villains, the lingering past, the pace sometimes take too long on certain element and not enough on some. Not to mention the transition can be cumbersome, it doesn't help that the usual coincidence and practical cliché plots still persist. The flaws are there, yet its entire cast and production value overshadow them. Its simple premise of one overcoming their crisis is emotionally captivating, effectively presented and thoroughly entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

ANDREW DESERVES MORE.,"(GOOD MOVIE WITH MANY FAILURES). Andrew has one of the best Spider-Man outfits to date. The movie starts off really well, the jokes are really good. The fact of Peter's promise interferes a lot, and at the end of TASM 1 he says he's going to continue with Gwen, and out of nowhere he starts to hallucinate. When Gwen is leaving to have a future and he stops her, I didn't like it either. Their relationship is rocky, but it's a thriller romance movie, so it's good. The opening scene is perfect. Gwen's death is very shocking and it makes me sad to remember it. Villains are very bad. Unmotivated electro and horrible looking, Harry's Goblin is horrible and looks like a vampire after blood. Peter going after his father's mysteries is interesting, and finally the speech scene and when he goes back to SPIDERMAN are excellent.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"A solid, entertaining film.","So soon after Tobey Maguire's Spiderman Trilogy, the decision to reboot the franchise may have been seen as bizarre to some. However, the first in this new series, Amazing Spider-Man, was thoroughly entertaining, and this second instalment has similarly impressed. In the film, Spider-Man has to deal with new enemies including Electro and the Green Goblin, as well as Rhino. The action scenes were refreshingly good and, although there were too many romantic scenes for my liking, which in turn made the movie slightly too long, they were humorous at times - throughout the movie, there were scenes which triggered a few laughs from the audience which lightened up the production. Having said that, I don't think that it was as dark as the first instalment. All in all, a film worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun but lackluster,"Despite the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, the incredible action, the great visual effects and the emotion, the movie falls short narrative wise, especially after the quality of the first one. This film tells us about Peter Parker's daily life as Spider-Man and the problems in his personal life. The problem is there are many other topics that are addressed and none of them has the time and quality required. If the first movie had very few ""Plotholes"", well this movie is the exact opposite, narrative inconsistency, continuity issues and too many conveniences.The villains are both poorly developed for lack of screen time which leads us to not understand either their side or their motivations.Overall I think it was a waste of potential, but it's still a fun and enjoyable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Amazing Spider-Man 2: Not so amazing,"I didn't enjoy the first Amazing Spiderman and went into it doubting I would, I was frustrated that the franchise had been rebooted so soon but it was a passable effort.Because of this my hopes for the second part were higher and they certainly weren't met with anything favorable.Spiderman returns and this time he's battling an unrecognizable Electro and later an even less unrecognizable Rhino, oh and a pants looking Green Goblin.Because these movies made less than the Sam Raimi movies it was decided to pull the plug and no third part was set to be made. Which is a shame considering certain things teased at the end of the film but will never happen now.Again Garfield doesn't shine in the titular role, in fact few people do. This sequel is uninspired, hollywood cliche filled and quite frankly boring.The Good:Colm Feore & Dane DeHaanThe Bad:The changes to the villians are far too severePoor soundtrack againThings I Learnt From This Movie:Paul Giamatti should adopt his characters look on the inside so that his appearance is as ugly as his personalityMost superheroes also have the power of recklessly endangering the publicLittle known fact, the Christian god's real name is Sparkles therefore Electro couldn't have called himself that in fear of getting sued",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
REALLY BETTER THAN BOTH MCU SPIDER MAN MOVIES,"Yes, What I said in the heading of the review is true.
This movie is not that bad what critics says or some people or""SPIDEY FANS"" says this spider man is not a "" IRON SPIDER"" if you are getting what I want to say.
Now days what spider man movies we all are getting is zero if we compare it with its cinematography ; Basic plot (yes basic) ; and the most important ""SPIDER MAN COSTUME"" (yes I really love this costume and web shooter).

The crowded story in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 shoots an unfocused mess of cobwebs.,"The modern summertime at the movies has developed a tradition where a superhero movie or two is released that can please both a general audience looking to be lost in a fantasy and a comic book crowd that's counting to see if everything is properly represented. Before the 2000's, most of these adaptations took two different paths that separated these crowds; either something that's more playful with bright colors like Superman and the original Spider-Man that's self aware that it's campy and silly. And there's the dark and dramatic route that Batman and The Crow took with an atmosphere that's cold but stylish, and bolder character development.Most superhero movies today tend to go with the latter. The idea behind this is that with every caped crusader, there has to be some big epic story with how they got there and the dilemma they must be going through, doing their typical ""saving the day"" routine. The previous Spider- Man trilogy had more of a campy route with occasional scenes of dramatic character arcs. The recent reboot of The Amazing Spider-Man gave our friendly neighborhood hero a reimagining that was darker, but still the same wisecracker we loved. It took me by surprise, so it made sense that I was hyped to see where the story would go in The Amazing Spider-Man 2.So what's going on? The real question is, ""What's not going on?"" as the movie tries to put a lot into it's story. Peter Parker (played by Andrew Garfield) has settled into his role as New York's favorite son as he catches thieves, thwarts dangers, and saves an occasional life, including that of an electrical engineer Max Dillon (played by Jamie Fox). What Spider-Man didn't know was that Max was a big fan of the Web Slinger, and dreams of being just as important and wanted.An accident with electric eels causes Max to mutate into a living electric generator. His debut is met with disgust and horror. In a spectacular action sequence, Max calls himself Electro and starts to destroy Time's Square, finally releasing his personal anger with the world. You would think that Spider-Man would have enough trouble with this guy, but Peter also has to deal with discovering that his father may have been hiding top secret research work from evil, his best friend Harry Osborn (played by Dane DeHaan) returning to take over his dad's company, a relationship with Gwen Stacy (played by Emma Stone), and even the beginning of submitting photos for The Daily Bugle newspaper.There's a lot more plot to tell, but I don't want to lose focus. That's the biggest problem with The Amazing Spider-Man 2; it tries to tell a lot of story. Since they got the origin story out of the way in the previous film, I thought that this movie would be ready to give us something that was different from the previous trilogy. In truth, I found myself making a lot of comparisons to the okay-received Spider-Man 3.It shares the same problem of adding in too many villains and rushing most of the development in place for uninteresting story and jokes. I can only blame the less then average screenplay, as the acting here is really good. The material with Electro, with his back-story and the battle sequences, was so good that I don't know why they simply didn't settle on that for a movie. There's nothing wrong with a superhero film that's only ninety minutes long. I can tell that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a result of a director's vision clashing with Sony's corporate idea of setting up a franchise. It never meshes enough for a solid story.I'll give this four comic book electros out of ten. This movie has impressive acting, impressive visuals, and impressive cinematography, but it's badly put together story lacks true excitement that I got from the previous franchise. Ughit was close.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"A solid action movie, but it (please forgive me for this pun) just seemed to lack a little spark!","The debate still probably continues as to the necessity of this second trilogy of Spider-Man films so shortly after the first, but to me - based on the first two so far - they are far superior. Sure, 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is not as good as its predecessor from two years ago, but it is still very enjoyable. The film does well linking back to the first film, while also laying some back story for the next one.The storyline starts off quite simple - Peter & Gwen are in still in love, but he's conflicted because of the promise he made to her Dad, so there's a bit of ""will they, won't they?"" But at least we have Garfield & Stone - both just plain better actors than Maguire & Dunst. They introduce Max/Electro (Foxx) quite well, but Harry Osborn (DeHaan) a little less so. And I wish they'd saved the Stan Lee cameo for later on! Still, it's mostly faithful for the comics - with the exception of Giamatti as The Rhino (almost unrecognisable!), although it makes sense he'd be in metal armour, rather than rubber!I feel they went a little too close to the original trilogy by focusing on Osborn/Green Goblin/Oscorp and not enough on Electro as the main villain & Gwen as the love interest. When you see how powerful Electro becomes (I don't recall him being as strong/capable in the comics), it makes you question why/how Spider-Man would actually be fighting him - seems like a job for the Fantastic Four or The Avengers! It's probably a little too long at 2 hours 20min, but still, there's some rousing speeches (thanks Aunt May & Gwen), some very funny moments and plenty of great action. It just seemed to (please forgive me for this pun) lack a little spark!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The Amazing Spider-Man 2, the best since Spider-Man 1.","(NO SPOILERS) The movie was awesome. The opening scene was intense, just how I'd predicted it. The way it became darker throughout the movie. The chemistry between Gwen and Peter was amazing. Dane Dehaan's Harry Osborn was creepy, but damn good. I know this is a short review, but the movie was really good. I personally prefer Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker. Emma Stone makes a great Gwen Stacy. Green Goblin's new glider was AWESOME. Dane Dehaan did a pretty good job with the character he was playing. Electro was awesome, and you did feel sorry for him BEFORE he became evil. Little old Max Dillon on his own made you feel sorry for. Although, I hated Paul's performance of the Rhino. The Rhino sucked. I thought he was gonna be awesome, but man, was I wrong. In my head, I skipped his scenes.This is about the best Spidey movie since Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 1.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spiderman is a detective!,"Why are detectives so funny to people? Firstly, let me acknowledge that I love Andrew Garfield as Spiderman. Captain America ""Civil War"" was great.If you're going to do Spiderman, you either have to start small, from his beginnings, and dedicate a whole movie to that, or just make a movie assuming he already holds the mantle of superhero and have him solve a big mystery using his brains. More of Spiderman at the computer if nothing else.I know this may remind some of the Spiderman and Friends cartoon, so if you're too cool for that I guess, then, well... So what.This movie did not captivate me or anyone else. Who cares if Andrew Garfield is young. It would be that much more hilarious if he was a well-established superhero in New York City. Then, just when he thinks he has everything figured out, an alien craft is reported over the city. At first the sighting is a joke, but a week later people begin disappearing. Mutilated bodies appear in the streets. A strange creature called Venom is rumored to exist. Spiderman must fight him and then in the end he wins back the black Spidey suit in the most epic thing that has ever happened. Bitchin'.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"With a dull story and lame script, sadly not that amazing","The are many bad things in this world, and one of them is those occasions in which we find somebody or something saying/doing a lot but really not saying/doing anything at all – Marc Webb's follow up to his surprisingly great popcorn adventure from 2012 is sadly one of those such occasions. Upon conclusion of this 130 minute plus blast of hot air it becomes clear that the hope we had with the reboot of an already new franchise is now sadly hanging in the balance of movie purgatory, a place that is neither here nor there and a place where we the audience now will find it hard to care what else this franchise has to offer.Webb's 2012 film benefited greatly from a fresh sense of direction that Webb harnessed to great use in his breakout movie 500 Days of Summer, but here just a few years on the direction and pace of this ""amazing"" adventure feels well and truly drained of its power. As mentioned in the opening the film exists to cover ground that has been covered before and makes this venture seriously hard to warm to when so many words and scenarios are playing out for playing-out's sake. With Webb's direction feeling now lacklustre the bad mojo spreads to his cast in particular Andrew Garfield who gets lost in a movie that his natural charm can't escape from, his Spider-Man and Peter Parker that showed youthful enthusiasm in the first is here nothing more than a wisecracking, sulky mess that makes you wonder if we should actually even like him, although the story Garfield has been placed in is so overplayed now over all these incarnations that it could just be fatigue from over familiarity that even the introduction of two new villains cant solve.Jamie Foxx coming off his most beloved film Django Unchained was a hot casting choice as the sorry and powerful Electro while Dane DeHaan so good in Chronicle and The Place Beyond the Pines was also a score for the movie's casting, but both man sadly don't get much shift with a particular wasting of Foxx. Foxx's dweebish Max Dillon is neither scary or human enough to be memorable and he does overplay the outsider nature of the character to unbelievable levels, while DeHaan has small moments, his Harry Osborn is perhaps being saved for later entries to shine truly. The ensemble as a whole here feels weak which is a shame, an indictment backed up the fact Paul Giamatti who appears for 5 or so minutes seems far more interesting.Without a real stand-out action piece, and with far too much exposition that has been covered before this Amazing movie feels anything but. For a film with a $200 million budget and with talent in all departments it's a real shame that it turned out to be the movie that it is, although with 5 separate Spider-Man films now done and dusted, one must wonder if there is anything that could make this blockbuster staple truly jaw dropping again.This particular reviewer would be leaning towards the answer of highly doubtful.2 mid air data transfers out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I mean sure, Spiderman jokes more than enough this time around and the drama seems to take up most of the movie, but that's a lot how the comic book was as well. I think the story was very progressive this time and there were moments where I honestly felt like hugging the person sitting next to me while watching Peter and Gwen go through their love life. The special effects and camera angles were very neatly put together and I thought the action was pretty amazing too... no pun intended.

I honestly enjoyed it very much.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A mixed bag,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is rather... disorganized. There's a lot here, but it feels like it was meant to play out in a different order. It feels like Sony didn't know what to do with the story.The opening scene with Peter's parents on the jet did NOT need to happen. The assassin on the plane is legit the WORST assassin I've ever seen portrayed in media. The story details fed to us, being the fact that Richard Parker was uploading his research to a private server rather than selling it to the highest bidder, is also not necessary and undermines the false information Peter initially finds. If this scene was cut out of the film, it would instantly make it a bit better.The first scene with Peter swinging around as Spider-Man is excellent. The new suit is really cool and pleasing to look at. We also get to see a good depiction of Peter's daily life as Spider-Man, stopping criminals, saving civilians, and swinging around New York. The part where he saves a kid from bullies is so wholesome an reminds us that Spider-Man is always looking out for the little guy.Then there's Max Dillon. Having him feel like he's unappreciated is a rather good character trait, but having him be literally obsessed with Spider-Man is just weird. If they showed him with his family, it would have made his descent into the villian of Electro more... impactful. Jamie Foxx still does a great job with his performance.Harry Osborn's role in this movie is rather mid. He was never mentioned in the first movie, and having him just appear 30 minutes into the movie is just so sudden. I know they wanted the green goblin in this movie, but at least give us a mention of Harry sometime before his first scene.The fight in Times Square is pretty good for the most part. Max finally feels seen, and now with his new powers, giving him a feeling of strength. The VFX for Electro are also really good, and the scene where Spider-Man uses his Spider-Sense to save civilians on the Times Square Steps is really well done with some fantastic camera movements. The worst part about the fight is that it's over within just a few minutes. They could have had Spidey and Electro jump from building to building, with Spidey hanging from billboards while Electro glitches them would have elevated the fight to iconic status. At least we got to see Spidey wearing a firefighter hat.Gwen deciding to move to London doesn't feel right. She has a well paying job at New York's biggest corporation. Why couldn't she just attend college in Manhattan? It would have made more sense if she decided to move to London to flee from Oscorp, as they begin pursuing her after she learns about the confidential Max Dillon incident.The arc with Peter trying to figure out his parent's past didn't need to happen. It was in the first movie, and this arc only exists to clarify that only Peter can be Spider-Man by explaining that only a Parker can access the spider's benefits (which later gives way to Harry's transformation into the Green Goblin.)
And the lawyer that sabatoges Harry and gets him fired is a neat addition, although I wish he had a motive for doing so.The final fight with Spider-Man and Electro looks really cool but feels overproduced as hell. They're fighting in a super-massive power grid that looks to futuristic for the movie's time period (I don't care if Oscorp has this kind of tech, it just doesnt feel natural), The screen is constantly flashing with Electro's movements which look good, just overproduced.Harry as the Green Goblin makes some sense. He's going after Spider-Man as revenge for not being able to use his blood, which feels justified considering his mutation. His costume also looks good, and the fight in the clocktower is great, with the best part being Gwen's death.Gwen's sudden death hits really hard, as on a first viewing with no prior knowledge, the average viewer would most likely expect a less dark outcome. Having it be so abrupt really enhances it's effectiveness, as the loud thud as Gwen hits the floor feels strong and impactful. Andrew Garfield's performance is top-tier here, with his facial expression and line delivery making you feel sad for him.The montage with him standing over Gwen's grave through different seasons also feels emotionally strong. Death can really affect a person, and the only thing Peter can do is grieve. He feels weaker after her death, as he was too late to save her.Having the movie end on a cliffhanger with the Rhino fight was ok at the time, considering that Sony really wanted to make a sequel to this film.In short, this movie has some good parts, and some... not so good parts. Each character has like 3 different arcs they go through, most of which don't go anywhere. The story feels entangled in the web that is this movie, and it could most definitely could have been done better.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Shaky, mixed feelings about it.","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was one of the movies I was looking forward to the most in the beginning of summer 2014. When I saw it in theaters, I was blown away. Now that I own it and have had a chance to study it, I've come across some issues.Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker is weak in this movie compared to the first Amazing Spider-Man movie, where Garfield's Peter was excellent and Spidey not so much.Truth be told, I want to like Andrew Garfield's portrayal because you can tell he genuinely loves Spider-Man and I'm happy that he gets to be Spider-Man, but this was weak. Hopefully future movies will allow him to fully express the Spidey persona.Now, as for Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy, I couldn't care less for her. Sure, she helps Spider-Man here and there but eh. I could do without her.The one character that redeemed this movie (in my opinion) was Dane DeHaan's Harry Osborn. I CANNOT get enough of him and I'm looking forward to seeing more of him as Green Goblin. His portrayal is spot-on maniacal and dangerous, even though he wasn't in the movie for that long.Another redeeming factor is the easter eggs and references here and there, like the notorious Daily Bugle editor...This movie feels like a set-up rather than an actual movie. It's like a 2 hour-long preview of what's next to come and I honestly have no problem with that, except when it gets exhausting.The plot is flawed, so are the motives of some characters and despite its great soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, even I got tired of literally every scene having too much music in the background. Can't recall a quiet scene other than the closet one.In the end, it's not as bad as people make it seem but it definitely has its issues.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spider-Man's amazing prowess is as solid as his webs,"Whether you have watched previous Spider-Man movies or not, there are tons of potential and spectacular elements where you won't be able to see in Marvel counterparts in this film.What easily makes me say such a bias statement? The director and the team know how to deliver fantastic and thrilling camera angles to showcase flexible, fast-paced, and detailed web techniques that Spider- Man used when going through oodles of hazardous obstacles to protect citizens in New York while naturally executing chores and roles as an ordinary guy. If that does not live up to your expectations, get ready to giggle at some of the jokes along with mischievous antics.The super-villain, the blue-neon bodied nerd, Electro, is an electrifying and unique character to be seen. Jamie Foxx does his part as an actor and villain for the first time. The one-on-one battle that involves elemental moves and scientific tactics is the highlight of the movie. Although the plot get vaguely wrapped around between Electro and the Oscorp, it is still interesting to watch the character development.So what takes 2 stars away from me? It would be the complicated bonds between a young couple, Peter and Gwen, who just can't make up their mind by being hesitant, especially in the middle of the movie. I mean, it is normal for any couples to experience erratic emotions, but the whole romance definitely can be succinct to intensify other aspects.Despite a number of downsides, I would still strongly recommend this to anyone who is itching to watch a different type of feisty film. Because no movies can offer such a sticky, nifty, and vigorous action like ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2."" Yes, it is as good as the first one, or like others say, it is better.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Hilarious,"If this move labeled itself as a satire, it'd be genius. Unfortunately, they didn't intend for most of the comedy I found in it, so...
Andrew Garfield is a fantastic actor, as is Emma Stone, and plenty of other people in this movie-but I seriously think they just didn't care. Everyone seems bored. Jamie Foxx is a different story: he's trying so, so hard, and it just makes him stick out even worse. Electro is one of the dumbest villains in any movie in a long time.Add to that a cringeworthy score, a script that's trying to cram fifteen different plots into the same movie AND set up for a sequel, and almost nonstop product placement for Sony, and what you get is one of the worst superhero movies of the decade.All this being said...I would watch this again before I revisit the first Amazing Spider-man movie.

Much Better Than People Would Lead You To Believe,"So much negativity for a film that is far, far superior to the Raimi cheese-fest astounds me that it's a kin to praising Pearl Harbour over Saving Private Ryan in my opinion.This version, like it's prequel, is so much better than any of the Raimi films in all aspects from action, story, and CGI that it's no contest for me. In saying that though, I think the only part of this version I didn't really like was the way the Green Goblin was portrayed. He actually looked like a cross between Wolverine and a leprechaun and he was more laughable than menacing. Other than that however, this is a much more enjoyable film than any of the others.The story for the film, while being pretty predictable, is very decent for a super hero movie. I mean, how many super hero movies can have an Award-winning story that is NOT original or predictable? They are all the same in one way or another so for this story to be criticised more over others is a bit laughable. There is more of a ""love story"" with this sequel as well between Stacy and Parker, but unlike the way the annoying relationship between Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson was portrayed in the Raimi films, this one is not insufferable. And that's coming from a guy who hates any sort of romance in movies.The main cast done a stand-up job once again with Garfield and Stone doing well with their continuation of Parker/Spider-man and Gwen Stacy. Jamie Foxx and Dane DeHaan were excellent in their roles as Electro/Max Dillon and Green Goblin/Harry Osborn respectively, especially DeHaan as Harry Osborn who brought a sly, sneaky, and very snake-like menace to the character. I also liked the Stan Lee cameo again in this one....it wasn't as good as his cameo in the 1st film, but it was still a nice touch.Sam Raimi may have brought us a more up-to-date take on Spider-man but Marc Webb has made the franchise more enjoyable with less cheese. Ignore the hate and judge for yourself....you may just enjoy it as much as I did.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazingly lousiest Spider-man ever..,"The Amazing Spider-man is a total failure before.. So this part 2 still fail quite bad.. I'm really sick of the whole plot.. There are no basic responsible of a super hero.. He is trying to show off that he is spider- man every chance he had.. In part 1 he is taking off his mask very often showing his face and showing off his new skills to people.. Now wooing Gwen like a spoiled kid in his spidey suit trying to make her stay when she is leaving? And spinning a huge web saying I Love You telling the whole world.. W T F? If he is wooing Gwen as Peter Parker, that is still acceptable.. Wooing Gwen in spider-man suit makes him look like a skirt chasing whim who tries to impress girls with his spider-man identity.. Totally spoils the image of spider-man.. Just watch the Spider Man 1-3 by Tobey Maguire.. At least he brings out the spider-man with discipline and of some sense..

Amazing Spider-Man 2 Had So Much Potential,"I try really hard, not to compare a comic book, film adaptation, to that particular comic book, because it is like comparing apples to oranges. However, it's tough not to, at least, try to compare the two. I get frustrated with people who say, ""it's not as good as the book"", so I try not to do the same thing with the comics. However, the comic book fan in me had some problems with the Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014). If you remove Spider-Man from the equation, this actually is not a bad movie. There are some silly lines of dialogue in the script, however those conversations, fit appropriately into the Spider-Man mythos. Our Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield), is handed too many moments of comedy-relief and some of that comedy in the film, was not needed. It made Peter look, somewhat like a jerk. The producers of these films, need to remember, that a large bank of the motion-picture, viewing public, believe comic-book movies are silly, so don't make the film even more silly, by turning an already great character, into a cocky a-hole, especially if you want to keep ticket sales going.The special effects and action scenes are worth the money, if seen in the theaters or at home. The action captured on film is top-notch. Many emotions run high in this film. Although, I don't think she is a good Aunt May (Sally Field), she still manages to knock it out of the park with her performance. Dane DeHaan does a really good, unique, different approach, towards the character of Harry Osborn/the Green Goblin. He created a more darker form of Harry, that the James Franco version couldn't. Jamie Foxx as Electro, seemed a little bit like he was just collecting a paycheck and unfortunately, I didn't get it back in 2014. It wasn't until I saw his return, in Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), that I realized how good he was, at that particular version of Electro. I have a new appreciation of his performance, since 2014.Many emotions run high in the Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014). The chemistry between Garfield and Emma Stone, his Gwen Stacy (the character from the comics, that really changes Peter from a kid to a man), is very solid, but I still think the relationship, between Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst (Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson in the Sam Raimi movies), was more believable, which leads me to this. I am still a bigger fan of the Sam Raimi, Spider-Man films, although director Marc Webb, did show some promise in the Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014). It is promise, that might have grown into the form of a third film, which, as we all know, never happened. However, most of the characters from his two Spider-Man films, came back in 2021, so a legacy seems to have been established.7.2 (C) = 7 IMDB.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Amazing Spider-Man 2"" swings into better territory than its predecessor","When Sony decided for a quick reboot of the ""Spider-Man"" franchise back in 2012, the reactions fell into two camps: one which viewed the production as a shameless cash-grab way for the studio to retain the film rights to the character and the other being intrigued and relieved by new blood being brought in after Tobey Maguire and company's lackluster third outing.""The Amazing Spider-Man"" was a reasonable success critically and commercially, and Sony quickly targeted the 2014 summer movie season to begin with its sequel. This second installment starts where the first left off. Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is still on the hunt for answers to what happened to his parents, while trying to balance the new superhero gig and a complicated relationship with Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone).As with round one, the real highlights are in the puppy love bits between Garfield and Stone. The two have a quirky chemistry that's bolstered by the offbeat humor both bring to their respective roles. Garfield in particular shines in the most trying of moments for his character that require more tears than webbing.Of course, no love story can come off perfectly. A new array of baddies are on the hunt for our hero, including Electro (Jamie Foxx) and younger Green Goblin in the form of Peter's old buddy Harry Osborn (Dane DeHann). Foxx's Electro comes off as a tad too goofy to ever be taken as a threat, but DeHann's Osborn is a real seat-shaker, perfectly pitched as a true creep with overwhelming power.There are plenty of twists and turns along the way, with a genuine stunner in the final moments that will lead to some dropped jaws. The question remains, though: after seeing this latest film in Sony's prized series, which camp is more justified in its reasoning?While the studio is undeniably banking on the webslinger's worldwide popularity to coast to the $1 billion-mark in box office receipts, director Marc Webb is at least continuing to do his best to bring a youthful, dynamic version of Marvel's biggest hero to the silver screen. There's just enough new drama to keep audiences engaged in what turn Peter will make next.That being said, at nearly two-and-a-half hours long, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" can still drag from time to time, ironically more in the action than the lower key segments. Proving to be a true contrast to most other films in the superhero genre, it's those romantic moments between Peter and Gwen we crave, and the CGI blasts can often feel in the way of that joy.It's an upgrade over the first film for sure, and Webb makes sure to dangle some carrots in front of us at the conclusion for future films. While it certainly has its faults, the wall-crawler's latest is an admirable start to the summer movie season for its stellar performances more than its loud effects.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Electrifying yet overstuffed,"""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" directed by Marc Webb, continues the adventures of Andrew Garfield's Peter Parker as he balances his life between high school and his duties as Spider-Man. This sequel ramps up the stakes with the introduction of multiple villains, including Jamie Foxx's Electro, Dane DeHaan's Green Goblin, and Paul Giamatti's Rhino.Garfield and Emma Stone (as Gwen Stacy) again deliver standout performances, with their on-screen chemistry being a highlight of the film. The emotional depth of their relationship adds a significant layer to the story, grounding the high-flying action with genuine heart.Visually, the movie is a spectacle. The special effects, particularly during Electro's electrifying sequences, are stunning and provide thrilling action scenes. However, the film suffers from an overabundance of plotlines and characters, leading to a sense of being overstuffed and occasionally unfocused.While ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" offers plenty of excitement and solid performances, its attempt to juggle too many elements prevents it from achieving greatness. It's an enjoyable ride but ultimately lacks the cohesion needed to elevate it above a standard superhero fare.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It could have been better,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is technically more polished than the first movie but falls short in several areas. While the first film had a more grounded and realistic tone, this one exaggerates the motivations and actions of its villains. Electro's backstory feels incredibly forced-he turns into a villain after a series of improbable events, including an unhealthy obsession with Spider-Man and reckless decisions like working on active machinery. Harry's descent into villainy is similarly rushed. Although his motivations are clearer, his sudden urgency to cure his illness (which we know progresses slowly) lacks credibility and undermines his character arc.The biggest issue, however, lies in the climax. Spider-Man, who demonstrated incredible skill with his webs in the first movie-stopping a giant lizard and even holding cars in motion nearly instantaneously-seems inexplicably weaker here. Against Harry, he barely uses his webs effectively, even when they would clearly have been the best option. This inconsistency makes the final moments feel contrived and less impactful than they should be. Moreover, Gwen's decisions in the final act come across as stubborn, diluting the emotional weight of the scene.That said, the movie has its strengths. The action sequences, particularly Spider-Man's fight with Electro, are visually stunning and well-choreographed. The chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone remains a highlight, with their romantic dynamic adding depth to the story. Unfortunately, the film feels more focused on spectacle than on delivering a coherent, emotionally engaging narrative. While it has moments of brilliance, the inconsistent storytelling and character development hold it back from reaching its full potential.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Left me cold,"There's something about this one that left me cold - uninvolved.But first: if you haven't seen it yet, stay through the final credits - all of them. There's a trailer that's really a preview of a new X-Men movie.This time around, Stan Lee is easy to spot. He even gets a speaking line. I wonder if they paid him scale......After a few giant monster movies, the genre gets old. I saw nothing new and interesting about this movie's monsters. Big, nasty, powerful - yawn, been there, done that.There's an interesting contrast between Parker/Spiderman and Wayne/Batman: Batman comes from a wealthy family (and has Michael Caine as a Number Two), lives in a mansion; Parker and his aunt are barely getting by, live in an apartment.The spider-silk acrobatics are too far out to be believable. Each journey through the city (always conducted at altitude) takes at least 23 times his own body weight in silk thread.On the other hand, the special effects are great. Downtown New York has been destroyed in so many movies, it's a wonder anybody stays there.The local theater where we saw it dropped the 3D version early. I asked the manager about that; he said hardly anybody went to that one. I wonder of the thrill of 3D is wearing off.Bottom line: I'd go for the special effects, not the story.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Overlong but Spidey's Web still just hits the mark,"The second in this reboot series and for me possibly one of the better Spiderman movies. It's quite a long film with multiple arcs throughout. Our hero is struggling to juggle his options and wishes, with a loving girlfriend, family secrets and local hero status all fighting for his attention.Andrew Hatfield is very good again as our tormented hero, and his fellow stars don't let him down.We've a few villains and they are the best part of the film. Electro is well done by Jamie Fox, but it's our new man Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn who is the surprise with some great acting as the cornered dying young man.The story though is a bit of a mix. Too many strands seem to get in the way of each other and don't seem to resolve well. Problem is that stops actors developing their stories. This also bloats the film and can make it sag, and overall it's overlong.The big surprise is the 3D. It's absorbing and unobtrusive. Impressed. Thumbs up.Overall, it's a fine film.

This is what Comic Book Movies are supposed to be like,"For starters, let me say that this is not a perfect movie. The first act is rushed, and the plot loosens as the movie progresses. But this is what comic book movies should be like. Fun, action-packed, and believable performances are what make this movie good. It is not trying to be The Dark Knight, which I enjoyed. There are a few darker moments, but the overall feel of the movie is light and fun. That tone is perfect for Spidey movies, and that is where I think Sam Raimi went wrong with his Spider-Man trilogy. He wanted to make a good film, not a good Spider-Man film. Mark Webb is making good Spider-Man films, so critics are not liking it because they view it the same as they would Shawshank Redemption. And fans aren't on board because they want all superhero movies to be ""darker"". Ask Man Of Steel how that worked out.

Cartoonish and flat. The bad writing disembowels it completely.,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the unwarranted and unnecessary sequel to 2012's equally unnecessary and unwarranted The Amazing Spider-Man. It almost goes without saying that this is a staggeringly transparent cash- grab on the part of Sony and to a lesser extent Marvel, but the question is, is it worth your time and money?The short answer is, absolutely not. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 evokes unavoidable comparisons to the masterstroke of the 2002-2007 trilogy, Spiderman 2, which was unquestionably superior in literally every conceivable fashion. As a matter-of-fact, you'll often wish – during TASM2's 140 minute runtime – that you're watching Spiderman 2. But how can that be? As Buzzfeed like to remind us, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are delightful; Dane De Haan is a promising young actor with a striking resemblance to a young Leonardo Di Caprio and Jamie Foxx is an experienced actor playing a potentially strong villain. Behind the camera, director Marc Webb impressed everybody with (500) Days of Summer and a string of well-known music videos, so what could go wrong? The answer, as is often the case in failed blockbusters, is lazy, shitty writing. It will be of no surprise to anyone that screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman have each had a hand in at least one Transformers movie. But I digress.TASM2, much like its predecessor, tediously and uncharismatically explores the mystery of what happened to Peter's parents, while Peter himself unconvincingly gets adjusted to his new life as Spiderman. Typically, there is also an antagonist who pops out of the woodwork courtesy of Oscorp (which surely by now should've faced at least some legal scrutiny for becoming a world-leader in the manufacture of supervillains), and Harry Osborn also appears as the harbinger of an inevitable Green Goblin return. This much has surely been made obvious by the trailer.While this movie has some legitimately impressive action set-pieces, it succeeds only in turning a respectable group of lead actors into scenery-chewing, Saturday-morning-cartoon caricatures. During the film's non-action scenes, the leads unforgivably adopt ham-fisted pseudo- representations of their real-life personalities - I'm referring in mainly to Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone here. It becomes insipidly clear as the film goes on that their off-screen personality as a ""cute celebrity couple"" has been allowed to directly influence the writing. Often it feels as if they've just been thrown into a scene and told to improvise, and riff off of their natural chemistry. This is cute to watch, but when you suddenly remember that the last scene finished with an argument (or even an official break up at one point) it does make you question how well the writers knew their own screenplay. They chuckle and fawn giddily over each other, in spite of the fact that the narrative demands that they behave otherwise – like real human people would.Poorly written scenes are not in short supply, and they encapsulate the knuckle-bitingly poor dialogue that mutilates this movie from beginning to end. The dialogue in the original trilogy was far from Shakespeare, but it was firm, utilitarian dialogue that moved the plot along. Here, everything is awkward and confused. It also through this poor scripting and story-telling that it becomes unescapable to realise Peter is in fact, quite obnoxious and douchey in this incarnation of Spiderman. Look at the plot from the villains' point of view as the film goes along, and you'll see what I mean.Ultimately, TASM2 just left me feeling quite sad. The writers' tendency to open up plot holes the size of craters, and the bizarre shift toward Adam West Batman-style ""campy"" villains just made everyone seem like a dick who wasn't worth rooting for. By rebooting the Spiderman franchise this early – and getting a great cast to boot – Sony have made the unspoken promise that they've corrected the mistakes that the original trilogy made, and even improved upon its positives. However, they have achieved neither. This series has thus far done everything that the original series did, but slightly worse. Anything new it's tried to do, it has done poorly, and frankly I feel like a sucker for going to see it.BUT HEY, THEY'RE MAKING A THIRD ONE WITH DOC OCK AND VULTURE AND OTHERS.

A disappointing sequel to a beloved superhero...,"After the less amazing and darker reboot of the Marvel Spidey franchise, Spider-Man is back again with a sequel, swinging between skyscrapers in New York City, with his perfectly-designed costume. It seems that Spidey's costume has evolved throughout the years...this newly-designed costume finally resembles the costume he always wears in the comics.Moreover, it is noticeable that Spidey's CGI renders have improved a lot as we see Spidey swings by on the streets of New York City. We also get to see what Spider-Man really does in battle - always jokes while moving swiftly with his super-reflexes. Garfield and Stone have terrific on- screen chemistry as a couple and they have a few genuinely funny and heartfelt moments together in the film. The film does come with a major shocking plot twist at the end (not so much for the fans who knew Spidey for a long time though)Despite the CGI and costume design improvements, plot twist and a strong relationship between Garfield and Stone, the entire plot structure of the film is a disaster as things just keeps on happening from scene to scene. The film is overstuffed with various subplots and the pieces don't fit together nicely, without a central story tying them together: the mysterious disappearance of Peter's parents, Peter and Gwen's complicated relationship, the dual-sided nature of Harry and Peter's friendship, development of the new villains - Electro, Rhino and Green Goblin, Sinister Six setup, Aunt May and Peter's relationship after Uncle Ben's death...all in one film.The villains' motivations are fuzzy and poorly conceived. It's a pity to see such potential go to waste. Max/Electro and Aleksei Sytsevich/Rhino barely have character development in the film at all. Their character arcs aren't properly fleshed out as intended and they're barely connected to the main protagonist's character arc. You won't feel anything missing if they're both completely removed from the story, since it doesn't affect the overall plot of the film at all. It's understandable that the purpose of Rhino's inclusion to the film is for the next sequel's setup. However, it seems that the inclusion of Electro in the film serves no purpose other than to add more exciting, extravagant action fight scenes for the audience to watch. While the extravagance of the action scenes make the film more entertaining, it feels cartoony and not realistic at all.Worst, the tone of the film shifts drastically back and forth between fun, not-so-serious and entertaining to emotional, serious and dark, which takes some time for the audience to adjust and keep up with, hurts the film a lot. When there's a tender, intimate moment between Peter and Gwen happening in the film and you start to feel the emotions coming, the film robs them away by abruptly shifting to an Electro scene, a clue to Peter's parent disappearance appears, or another Harry scene.As a long-time Spidey fan, I personally feel that the film fails to capture the most influential, emotional and devastating moment in Peter Parker's life before meeting his lifelong partner, Mary Jane in the future. It lacks the much-needed emotional buildup to deliver the punch in the end, which is not present due to the horrendous plot structure and inconsistent tonal shifts of the film. The various subplots constantly interfere and collide with each other because that's how it was structured in the script. While seemingly looks good in script, it just doesn't translate well on screen.Furthermore, the Amazing Spider-Man 2 repeats the same mistakes as Iron Man 2, too many heavy-handed foreshadowing for future sequels, instead of making it a compelling stand-alone film. While the sequel is better than its predecessor (the first Amazing Spider-Man film) in many ways, it's still not the hands-down, best Spidey film that many fans would hoped to see.Rating: 6/10Although the story has a terrible narrative structure, I believe the central theme of the story should be dealing with life's two biggest questions:Are you capable enough to deal with the repercussions of taking chances, knowing that they might happen in the future? Are you willing to accept the consequences of not taking those chances and in turn living regretfully because of it?http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/05/movie-review-amazing-spider-man- 2.html",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

It is an example of what you get when you try to cram a lot of villains without a powerful plot.Electro's character building was not grasping enough to make him a fearful villain. The green goblin was a peck on the cheek! And Rhino was the gush of air before peck on the cheek! What were you guys thinking when you added them? The only savior was Peter's personal life. The short story of Peter's dad and Peter's love life were the reason this movie gets a 6 from my end.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Strong sequel worth the original,"Marc Webb does it again, delivering an excellent sequel that continues the story line, doesn't dumb down the characters, maintains its strengths, and for the most part improves on its weaknesses. In essence a perfect sequel.Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone reprise their roles and the two are just as adorable and lovable together as they were in the first film. And it's surprising how well their chemistry can overcome even the worst clichés. In a weaker film their particular romantic subplot would be painful to watch and you'd know instantly how it'd end. Not so much here. Their character have enough depth and they're played well enough that you not only buy it but you'll also feel like it could go either way. And that's good storytelling.Furthermore, the special effects and all the technical aspects are just as good as they were before. The fight scenes are still a lot of fun and this time even the settings are more grandeur and imaginative. The way they have realized the so called ""spidey sense"" is very cool to look at.Unfortunately the villains are still not that good. The more realistic tone and setting mean that their over-the-topness seems more silly than fun and they're not given as much room to shine as in the original trilogy. They're perhaps a bit improved from the previous film, but there's the new problem of there being too many of them. Hopefully the third installment can fix this one glaring weakness.All in all this is a great film. If you enjoyed the first film, this is definitely worth a watch, and even if you haven't, it's one of the best superhero films in recent years.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Amazing Spider-man? Naah,"I am a big fan of the spider man series, the previous one and not the 'amazing spider man' .. Two years ago when i went to see the first amazing spider man, i was let down by both, the story-line and the antagonist. I returned to theater this week in hope of seeing some improvement in our kid Peter.Not as disappointed as by the previous one but i wasn't too happy either. The story-line was still a little bit rushed and the villains , though vicious were not the 'sandman' or 'green goblins' , we had come to know from the original spidey series. Acting was justified to the story-line and direction was as expected, good. Andrew Garfield , however 'amazing' can never match the character done beautifully by Tobey Maguire.Among other flaws, this movie is incomplete emotionally and humorously. The pros of this movie... Emma stone i guess. She portrays Gwen Stacy's character quite nicely . Jamie foxx's potential , in my opinion has been wasted, he seems like a villain whom we all know can be destroyed(again nothing like sandman) and we do not worry over him that much. Dane Dee Han does a childish Harry Osborn , obviously Franco was wayyy better.The action scenes were good and they are one of the reason i gave this flick a 6 rather than a 5.Maybe if for a second you forget the original series by sam raimi, you might end up liking this movie , maybe not.In my opinion if you are not in a rush for a superhero movie, wait for x-men days of future past.

A must see,"I've been dying to see this movie since the amazing spider man came out in 2012, and this one did not disappoint. It lived up to every expectation I had of it and exceeded them. I am quite a bit Spider-Man fan so this movie was a big deal for me.I already knew the out come of the movie having read the comics and therefore spent a lot of the movie waiting to see how they played out the ending (which they did marvellously and I did actually even cry a little) other then that this movie was just simply marvellous, I couldn't think of any faults.The directing and acting was just superb as it was in the first movie but this was a step up. The comical elements where put all in the right places and presented effortlessly by the actors and actresses. The slow motion elements really made this film when watching it in 3D, but i wouldn't say it was necessary to see it in 3D.I've already planned to see it again with a friend and would recommend it to anyone who wanted to go to the cinema (even my sister who isn't a fan of marvel and also hasn't seen the first film loved this one and also cried)",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Enjoyable outing, but overdone in the multiple finales","I won't start this review by harping on again about the tired nature of Marvel/DC 're-imaginings' of the more popular elements of their respective portfolios - (if you want a recap of this particular rant, see my review of last year's Man of Steel at http://wp.me/p3bNxg-bJ ).Actually, the first film of this reboot series was pretty good: much less earnest and quirkier than the original Tobey Maguire series, and revelling more in the fun to be had around a superhero's schooldays. The finale of that film saw police chief Stacey - father of his girlfriend Gwen Stacey - make Spidey swear with his dying breath that he would stay away from Gwen in order not to put her in danger. So the first - very enjoyable - half of this film sees Parker (Andrew Garfield) struggling with this promise against his better hormones: she is Emma Stone after all, and he is only human! Garfield is as good in this film as in the first, bringing a depth of feeling and emotion to the role of the split-personality Parker/Spidey, caught between his duty and his feelings. And he has real chemistry with Stone: the couple are genuinely funny together and she looks just drop-dead gorgeous.There was a suggestion in the run up to this film's release that there would be only one main villain: a key learning from the true awfulness that was Spiderman 3. They lied. There are two main villains in this flick - two and a half if you count 'Rhino man'. (Seriously, anyone who has recently spectated at the London Marathon couldn't take this villain seriously... I certainly wanted to chant ""Rhino, Rhino, Rhino..."" at that bit).But I digress. The two primary villains of the piece are Electro, played rather well, in nerdy-janitor mode at least, by Jamie Foxx and The Green Goblin, played by up-and-coming star Dane DeHaan, whose first memorable movie appearance was as the kid-with-superpowers in the sleeper hit ""Chronicle"" from 2012. DeHaan has such a memorably strange and mesmerising face - somewhat reminiscent of the intensity of a young Leo DiCaprio - that his transformation into the leering Green Goblin is genuinely memorable.However, my main gripe with the second half of this film is that there is just too much going on. Both of these villains are quite good, but both together are complete overload (or in the case of Electro, over-voltage). Having two and a half villains means that there are two and a half finales to work your way through. And it's pointless: one of these main villains would have been fine and dandy, so save the other one to live another day until The Amazing Spider-Man 3. Less is more Hollywood! Given the choice, I would have ditched the rather ridiculous Electro ending and kept the 'Goblin in the bell-tower' scene. Whilst curiously reminiscent of a certain Keaton/Nicholson finale in the first Batman film, the ending - where Spidey falls for Gwen Stacey in a wholly different kind of way - is both thrilling and shocking in equal measure.So - in my view a game of two halves: first half 8/10, second half 6/10.(If you enjoyed this review, please see my other film reviews and sign up to ""Follow the Fad"" at bobmann447.wordpress.com.

TAS 2 Has all the makings of a summer blockbuster,"The Amazing Spiderman 2 manages to be cheesy, romantic, dark, funny, and epic, all without feeling bloated.Now that the new Spiderman series has its origin story out of the way, it ups the ante with more characters and plot lines that manage to all work without this almost two and a half hour movie feeling too crowded. Paul Giamatti's Rhino, who is only in it for a few minutes, and Jamie Foxx's Max Dillon bring a cheesiness to the series that is reminiscent of the original. Once Electro is cemented as the main villain of the movie, Spiderman doesn't see much of him. The marketing of the movie would lead you to believe that Spiderman is taking on three enemies at once, but not only does that not happen, there really isn't that much Spidey action overall.The film focuses a lot on Peter and Gwen's relationship, which surprisingly doesn't slow the movie down, and Harry Osborn gets a lot of screen time too. He is introduced as Peter's friend, who is a likable and sympathetic character, and Dane Dehaan does an excellent job.One subplot that seems thrown in is the mystery of Peter's parents. With a lot of buildup from the first movie, the solving of the mystery wasn't satisfying and that story arc was unnecessary in the movie.Overall, it is a great summer movie that I thoroughly enjoyed.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Not So Amazing Spider-Man,"TASM2 has had a number of things going against it, namely:1) The bar has been set very high indeed for Super Hero films -- esp. the Dark Knight Trilogy, Avengers, Cap, Iron Man and X-Men DoFP have all been on average fantastic. It's great for comic book lovers like most of are. Not so great for film directors and producers that don't really bring their A game.2) The plot is extremely unoriginal and very derivative -- for a refresher on a fantastic re-boot, re-watch Batman Begins. Or 007 re-boot Casino Royale with Craig James. When I saw that for the first time, I was like ""what the heck... is this James Bond? This is absolutely fantastic!"" It hits you right between the eyes. Does anyone get that sense from watching the TASM / TASM2 films? Not I.3) The villains (i.e Electro and GG) not only looked ridiculous, the dialog was uninspired and the costumes looked liked they were made from someone who had never read a comic book. Rhino was embarrassingly bad. Really.4) But, the main thing the TASM series has going against it is, frankly, Andrew Garfield. I don't think he's a bad actor. He was miscast, that's not his fault I guess. But he isn't a convincing Peter Parker. He's too old, he's too lanky and too depressing. Spidey / Parker, if nothing else, is bursting with personality with an amazing sense of humor, and he's gutsy -- I'd argue that only Captain America rivals Spidey's level of bravery / courage. As Parker, he has everything going against him -- loner nerd, has to hustle part-time job -- but I think deep down that's why comic book fans love and identify with Peter -- because WE could be Parker, hence, WE could be Spidey. That's why we root for Spidey. At least that's why I do.And I didn't feel an ounce of that from TASM2, and I have no interest in seeing TASM3 knowing we will get more of the same.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A mere time pass sequel,"The amazing spiderman 2 may not have the muscles to say its better than the first part.It's fair enough to say the sequel had lost some steam to some poor script and too much confrontation of idea of peter's woes.I'm not too sure the director concentrated hard on this part alone.His thoughts may have lingered with amazing spiderman 3 and 4 and that may be a reason for the half baked product.Now putting all the negatives aside,one can't write off this movie as a ridiculous movie.It was fun,entertaining.We already know that Andrew Garfield gave Peter Parker a new dimension and he has carried his good work from the first part.A little more drama on Peter would have made it nice to watch.Anyways try to watch it for the fun and not for logic.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Good Marc Spidey Webb Movie !!!,"after a quite good reboot of the spider-man franchise (TASM1), we can say this is the best spidey movie in the view of visual effects and background score.

I don't understand why they rushed so much with the villains and what they did to electro.The best of this movie are Gwen and Peter relationship, and Gwen as a character, and THAT scene.It was not worth of ending the whole saga, but well, great cast, excellent CGI, and a messed up script, but yet a good spider-man when he puts the suits on.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
It's Amazing Love Story Not Amazing Spider-man,"Sony has never learnt the mistakes from the first episode but chosen to utilise the same ways, especially putting all the great materials from the film in the trailer, to further reboot the sequel, making Spidey no longer amazing. While both Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone have exceptionally appeared as a perfect sweet couple thanks to their great performance, which is quite outstanding as no other superheroes have a powerful love story, but it is sad to see that it could only save the film as a fantasy romance story rather than becoming a better reboot of superhero film. Heavily used CGIs does not really enhance the film effects and the directional effort reduces the enjoyment especially to see Spidey jumping here and there from slow-mo to fast-mo, fast-mo to slow-mo for a repetitive times just like video games. However, it is surprising that collaboration between Zimmer and The Magnificent Six provides the film with a number of great scores, different style from the usual superheroes film.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Worst Spiderman movie yet...,"This movie was horrible. First of all, yes i am a little biased because i prefer Spiderman to have biological webs versus the home made ones in this version, which brings me to my first point. How does he afford these. It says in the first one that these are from Oscorp so he makes a hooter for them. Great. So we are to believe he is just buying these from Oscorp and no one has noticed their high-tensile strength line is the same thing Spiderman uses on a daily basis?Secondly,. how much power does a high schooler have? Gwen Stacey just say oh yeah I know how to shut down the power grid, no problem. Everything else has no power but good thing this one controller does. Backup generators all over the city are failing but this one thing works. Awesome.Third, Aunt May says at one point that she has to take nursing classes to afford to be able to put Peter trough college. What? She has to pay to take classes so she can pay for Peter too? This is not a good short term plan.Mostly my hatred of this movie lies in the overall story. this just was not a believable comic book movie and i love almost all of the comic book based movies that have come out in the past 10 years or so. This Peter Parker is not the shut out nerd we all love but more like the Emo- Cool nerdish type which is a complete departure from the comics. If you are a Marvel fan then go see this just for the sake of seeing it but I would wait until Netflix or something to do it. Hopefully if they go a third one, it will be much better than this trash. Instead go see Captain America 2, that is worth your time and money to see.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Bigger, louder, longer. Better?","After copping criticism for having a weak villain in the first movie, this sequel offers up three baddies to make Spidey's life hell and in the process sums up exactly what this follow up is aiming for: more, more and more. The teen angst is amped up to 11, the romantic pulling and pushing is nonstop and the threats against downtown Manhattan have tripled. Often when bigger and/or louder is the major goal of a movie it doesn't work out so great (see Transformers 2), yet returning director Marc Webb (no joke) handles the increased excess relatively well. The CGI-laden set pieces are, umm, electric and the fights are choreographed with panache, however the screenplay doesn't hold up quite as well. Straining under the influence of four different scribes and a rushed deadline, the plot is tonally muddled and chocked with clichés whilst the dialogue is not as witty and, with the banter between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey especially, less authentic. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone's sparky chemistry remains and Dane DeHaan and Jamie Foxx bring their A-game as Harry Osborn/Green Goblin and Max Dillon/Electro respectively, but Paul Giamatti, Felicity Jones and Chris Cooper are all criminally underused. There's a hugely impactful and ballsy plot turn near the end, which would've been a fantastic note to finish on, however its effect is diminished with a bizarre coda that serves no purpose other than to set up the series' next part. Too long and with flaws aplenty, Rise of Electro is nevertheless exciting and humorous in it's own bombastic kind of way.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Passable, but still not up to Raimi standard","Version I saw: UK cinema release (2D)Actors: 6/10Plot/script: 5/10Photography/visual style: 6/10Music/score: 6/10Overall: 6/10If the producers of this film thought everyone would have forgotten the Raimi versions by now, they were dead wrong. The reasons for these films are well-documented: contractual stipulations mean Sony lose the rights to the character if they don't make films on a semi-regular basis. The commercial machinations are quite interesting, in a way, but not very artistically credible.To be fair, in some areas, this version stands up quite well. Andrew Garfield makes a good Spidey, balancing the nerdy weakling and wisecracking hero sides of the character. This has especially pleased some people who never liked Tobey Maguire's portrayal, although I think he was at least as good. The rapport with co-star Emma Stone is good as well; whether this is just good acting or a sign of their reported off-screen romance I do not know, and to be honest don't much care, although I understand that it makes a great bit of PR. Too bad that... well, you'll see.Out of the two villains, Dane DeHaan has even more of a balance to strike as the schizophrenic Harry Osborn/Green Goblin, and manages it with more aplomb than James Franco did, in my opinion. It's just a shame that James Foxx is given so little to do as Electro. He is a very good actor, and doesn't deserve to be CGIed almost out of existence and given an emotional register that ranges from angry to very angry.The plot holes have been commented on by others, but I think they overstate the matter. Yes, there are plot holes, and contrivances, and none of the good stuff is quite enough to forgive this, but many of the criticisms don't hang together for me.The biggest difference between old Spidey and new, and the one that is most difficult to surmount, is the director. Marc Webb seems capable enough, but he just doesn't have that touch of flair that Sam Raimi could add at times. Without that, the new films will never be more than passable.For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogger, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
At the lowest point in Spider-man movies.,"The second movie in the new Spider-man movie series that directed by Marc Webb. I doubt his potential after seeing this movie. I feel someone should take his position before it become too late. In the history of the Spider-man movies, from all the 6 this one is the worst. Commercially it has done a great business that grabbed around $800 million all over the world, but failed to deliver another quality movie for the fans. The movie engaged with the too much character and subplots. The subplots were not placed in the right spots, kind of random appearance brings the chaos in understanding the story. I had a high hope on this movie and it did not supply well. Frankly, I kind of lost interest in Spider-man. Maybe because it was too soon to reboot, I guess.''You want to be the hero. And now you gotta pay the price.''The first movie gave a decent re-start for the refreshed Spider-man movie series. And what happened here in this second installment was a disaster. The first thing is it was nearly a 2 and half an hour movie that brought me lightly a headache to carry on thus far. Actually, it was 10 minutes shorter than what it is now, but in the end they have developed a bit longer to show the opening scene of the third movie. When a movie got a powerful hero, it should have equally matched antagonist. If they are matched, then the fight between them are the next thing to bring the best out of it. I think the Electro man did not click as they have expected, at least not to me. The strength he had was something beyond spider-man, but did not unleash him in a perfect manner. Though Jamie Foxx was not bad in that avatar, the filmmakers kind of wasted his presence for not so good scenes.Remember the original Spider-man was the modern superhero movies, I mean it was done using computer graphics. Afterwards 'Batman', 'Iron Man', 'Thor' and all were followed. I like the version with Tobey Maguire in it, though my rating declined by movie after another in the trilogy. This reboot series had a good opening, but failed to get the momentum going. Especially all the emotions were looked fakes that do not appeal like the original movie series did. Yes, it had a wonderful box office and that does not mean the movie is good, either worst. But expected a little better, especially in the negative characters. Andrew Garfield was good, not awesome, because most of his masked parts were CGI. Emma stone was another let down and could not help comparing her with Kristen Dunst, because she was no way near, at all. The Dane DeHaan role had the same issue and I don't know why people did not get better space in the movie that ran 140 minutes long. Like I said subplot spoiled everything I think. The digital 3D and stunts were poor. Yeah, there are many things to complain about it than to praise, but all the answer should come in the next sequel. If that makes bigger, not commercially, I mean with a good story, graphics and performances then there will be no problem. But if it fails, I had to say 'bring back the fourth installment of the original movie series'. Definitely not worth a watch, but anyway most of the guys going to watch it or already watched it.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The best adaption until now!,"The story, for a superhero movie, was well written, logical and just very good. A bigger universe is definitely created and I can not wait for the future. The movie was 150min but it didn't feel long at all. Because of good pacing and very good acting. The relationships that all the characters have in one way or another on screen was magnificent. (Not only Peter and Gwen but also props to Dane Dehaan as Goblin and Jamie Fox as Electro!! .... Each scene with them was a wow moment) If I only could see part 3 now.The action was a huge step up. This is how I want my comic book heroes to see on the silver screen. Nothing more to say about this part. Well crafted out, epic-moments and emotional moments.I saw it in 3D (only way for this avant-premiere) and the 3D was thanks to the 3D EPIC RED cameras full of depth. It felt natural and after a while you'll forget you have glasses on. It was very immersive and really added a new dimension! Occasionally they used also pop-out 3D.Summary: Big step forward for this Spidey universe. In my opinion best adaption of the comic-book hero.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Disappointed. Truly.,"I don't know why everyone seems to be showering this film with praise. Having been a Spider-Man fan from I was a child, and thoroughly enjoying the original Amazing Spider-Man, I was eagerly anticipating this title.We are initially hit with some standard Spidey action, and some mind- blowing special effects, in a visually stunning and typically sarcastic intro. There is some cheesiness to be taken with the beginning but this won't bother any self-respecting Spider-Man fan. At this point I was expecting more of the same throughout, cleverly broken up by Peter Parker and Gwen's story in order to add an element of realism and something for the female audience...Sadly, it was too much of this and too little of that for me. I spent the entire first hour and a half (that might even be generous) wondering when Spider-Man was going to have his first proper fight scene. Too often I found myself watching Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone going around in circles in their ""complicated"" relationship. A touch of the real is nice but when it's this overwhelming in a film that you'd expect to be pretty action packed, it really just wastes time, regardless of how good the chemistry on screen is.That is my biggest criticism of the film, the fact that it would probably be more accurately titled if it was called ""The Amazing Peter Parker"". However it is not the only flaw. They clearly were not confident enough in Electro as the main villain, considering there is a Harry Osborne/Green Goblin sub-plot. I really do believe that one or the other would have sufficed, with not enough time dedicated to either of the main villains. I think that in terms of screen time, both villains were short lived. The transition from Max Dillon to Electro was fairly quick and we don't see enough of him in action between the first and last encounter with Spider-man. That said, watching him at his best was entertaining, and the combination of incredible effects and a bit of slow-mo in the final face-off was satisfying, if too short and a tad too easy for Spider-man.The Goblin sub plot had even less time dedicated to it and while I feel that it was in preparation for the third film, I also feel that it was a poor attempt at making Spider-man's life that little bit harder. In my opinion the primary focus should have been on Electro's development as a villain, ultimately leading to Spider-Man having ONE seriously powerful enemy to dispose of. This aside however, I do feel they are building towards a sinister six film and so the inclusion of Harry Osborne is likely crucial going forward.In conclusion, the film felt as though it focused too much on the love story, for reasons that become obvious, but it was lacking in everything you'd want to see in a Spider-Man film. The action is good, the effects are unbelievable as expected but the balance is not right. Too much realism and too little spidey is a bad combination, here's hoping the third instalment doesn't dwell so much on The Amazing Spider-mans relationship difficulties. Disappointing, all in all.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spider-Man stuffed once again.,"Marc Webb returns to direct what Sony had hoped was the second instalment of a longer running reboot of the Spider-Man franchise. Writing this now, I'm armed with the knowledge that once again the web slinger will get another reboot in 2017, which after viewing this sequel comes as no surprise.It's not so much that it's a bad film, or a bad Spider-Man film at that, it's just that it feels all very familiar, whilst simultaneously hugging the same pitfalls as Sam Raimi's Spiderman 3. Webb tries to juggle a screenplay with 3 villains (well two and a half really), a tricky romance between Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), and of course there's school, a best friend and affairs of the home heart to deal with.The introduction of Electro (Jamie Foxx) is a good move, inputting a new villain into the spidey world is most welcome. Yet in spite of Foxx earning some level of sympathy with the characterisation, it never really works and unfortunately draws comparisons with a certain Mr. Freeze from another franchise. Dane DeHaan comes in as Harry Osborn, soon to be Green Goblin, again the tortured soul act is well performed, but come Goblin time the make up and effects work is laughable. While Paul Giamati as Aleksei Sytsevich - cum - Rhino, is having fun but is barely in the picture.Stone is the best thing in it by far, while Garfield works hard, but there is no getting away from the fact that they both are - and look - too old for their parts. The action is fun and pulse raising, but there's not enough of it to sustain a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes. Though on the plus side Webb and his team are to be applauded for choosing a story line that is ultimately bold and contains a great emotional whack. All told it's a shaky entry to the spidey world, one that once again forced Sony into another rethink. Lets hope the next journey spidey goes on has some clarity and streamlined sense. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Didn't Sony learn their lesson from Spider-Man 3?,"While I wasn't initially excited about having this franchise rebooted so soon, I did enjoy THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN even if it did rehash the same old origin story that fans are all too familiar with. Here, the sequel is bigger but not quite to its advantage. First off, I'll say that Andrew Garfield is excellent as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Even if he's not quite an awkward, geeky character, he at least has the wisecracking down to a 't.' Emma Stone also does an excellent job as Gwen Stacy. And the relationship between her and Peter is done rather well. In general, the cast gives good performances, with a couple of big exceptions though. The special effects are also top-notch, and Electro has a few scenes to show off his powers that really impressed me, even on my laptop.However, the area where this film falls short is the script. I'm no fan of Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and they deliver an overstuffed narrative that tries to juggle too many characters and subplots, to the point where several of them feel shoehorned in as fan service. For this film to have been effective, Electro should have been the sole villain. You would have thought that Sony learned their lesson with Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN 3, but they obviously didn't. Green Goblin's introduction (and one of its consequences) feels rushed and tacked on to the end, while Rhino was completely superfluous. And to make matters worse, Paul Giamatti completely hams it up in the worst way possible.To touch on a couple other things, the plot is so unwieldy that certain scenes stick out as the contrivances they are, merely excuses for characters to meet and exchange information, or for exposition. Overall, this movie's greatest sin is that it tried to do too much and as a result it was a good half-hour too long. Certain characters and subplots could have been left out so that more time could be devoted to fleshing out the main story. In the end, what you're left with is a visually impressive comic book movie that feels like a stepping stone to something else, in this case a Sinister Six movie. If you're a fan of these movies, or the Spider-Man character, just go ahead and see it if you haven't already. For everyone else, just stick to Sam Raimi's trilogy.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spidey's latest film swings to victory,"When I saw this movie I had very high expectations due to enjoying its predessesor. It surpassed them when I saw this on opening night. The two main villain arcs are very well done as are all the characters. They are engaging and are what the directors clearly wanted to drive this movie. That and the tense action sequences impressed me greatly. People say this is has too many subplots and here is the thing, the spiderman comic books are all driven by subplots with one huge plot hiding in the shadows and this film makes me excited for the sequels due to its pitch perfect storytelling and perfect performances. I saw spiderman from the comics not people dressing up for halloween.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"It's Good but Not ""Amazing""","Marc Webb's follow up to his rebooted Spider-Man franchise still leaves much to be desired but remains a worthy installment.The film originates with a confused Peter Parker (Garfield) struggling with the morality of what is best to do for Gwen Stacey (Stone). Eventually deciding to stick to his promise to her deceased father (Denis Leary) of keeping her out of his business, he is soon thrust a further set of challenges when his sudden new best friend Harry Osborn (DeHaan) reveals he needs Spider-Man's blood to save his life, Jamie Foxx reeks havoc as the villainous Electro while trying to piece together his father's past.While I commend Webb for trying, his efforts to strand all these plot points together hinders the film more than it helps. It's comparable to trying to cram twenty DVD's into a stack which hold 19, it just doesn't fit, unless you cut parts off the other DVD's to make space. This is exactly what Webb does. If you have viewed the trailers, you will realise already that many scenes did not make the final film due to the scenes being removed; this is most probably due to time restrictions on the duration. However, rather than delivering a complex and engaging story-line, Webb leaves us with numerous unfinished - some rather basic - plots and sub plots.Expanding briefly on this point, I would like to commend Dane DeHaan's performance. An excellent young actor for sure, his lines and performance throughout gave his scenes gravitas, and were the engaging. In interviews prior to the release, he stated he ""doesn't think I'll ever have a character that has this big of an arc (again)"" and that Harry is ""completely different"" from at the beginning to what he is at the end. This is true however that character arc to me felt very rushed and not very complex at all; judging by the edited out scenes I'm guessing there was a beefier run through of his transformation which unfortunately as viewers, we were unable to witness.Instead, Webb focuses on his hit-and-miss villain ""Electro"", the touching relationship between Stone and Garfield (on the screen, although maybe off also) as well as the dreary recollection of Richard Parker's past.Let's begin with ""Electro"". To me, his inclusion feels like a CGI prop to be perfectly honest, for the most part, while Jamie Foxx doesn't really feel suited to the role of this flying electric ball (this is from someone who thinks he's a great actor, and loved 'Django').The romantic scenes - as you may expect - are done remarkably well by Webb with his experience under the helm of '(300) Days of Summer' playing a key factor here. He also chose the cast for Peter and Gwen with great precision as the chemistry is clear for all to see. Both these factors deserve commending.The sub slot however of his father and his dealings with Norman Osborn feels half baked. A James Bond style opening is followed by a rather uninteresting reflection on what makes Richard Parker such a good man.One final qualm is the action sequences which feel labored and never particularly engaging. Battles with Electro are just an overloaded CGI frenzy while the Paul Giamatti's eagerly anticipated Rhino makes an appearance for about two minutes (in costume). Equally irritating is DeHaan's appearance as the Goblin being very short and its fair to say his transformation leading up to that was hardly detailed on the final cut.However, having focused on the criticisms, the majority of the cast were first class and the on-screen chemistry between Stone and Garfield was a lovely touch. DeHaan steals the show with his performance as Osborn (which fills the cracks about his character development ever so slightly) whilst most importantly, I can look to the next installment with optimism. Optimism stemming from a cliffhanger ending, more DeHaan and a host of possibilities for Garfield to forefront.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What is this? Twilight?,"Well, what can I say? It was a little bit disappointing. The first 20 minutes are really awesome, the 3D conversion is pretty good. But, of 140 minutes of movie, only just 40 or 50 are of Spiderman saving New York, and doing some great stuff. The rest, it's only romance, and sub-plots. And it gets to annoy. At least, Raimi's trilogy had some New York aerial shots. In this movie, almost everything is CGI. The fights are good, but, too short. And,in some shots, the CGI looks extremely FAKE. It's good, but not that good. It's not epic, and it's absolutely forgettable. Yes, I admit it take my breath in some shots. I'm not saying that Raimi's trilogy it's best, but the every fight with Dr. Octopus is Spider-man 2 it's just... epic. I like the visual style of Marc Webb, it's like a comic book.

More Parker than Spidey,"Marc Webb returns to a universe that he seems to have well mapped out with a clear and bold vision. This instalment is another sequel, in another reboot of the Spider-Man franchise and one of my most anticipated films this year.. so far.I went with my 8 year old son and we chose to view it in 2D, to appreciate the scenery chewing web-flight sequences (and they are the best I've ever seen in this series). Apart from an electric eel staring at the camera, I could not see any part of the film that would be improved by wearing chunky spectacles.The tagline is 'His greatest battle begins' but we soon discover that the battle is not between Spiderman and his enemies, but between Peter Parker and growing up.Webb is determined to stamp his mark and set this reboot as the one by which all else will be measured. He begins his character driven movie by introducing a previously (in film) unknown backstory concerning Peter's parents. While it adds another level to the drama, it does feel a little forced and somewhat unnecessary, but it is only part of the many strands that makes this outing a treasure-trove of studies on relationships.The main thrust of the story is the love triangle between Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker and Spider-Man. They are stepping cautiously into adulthood, and have serious choices to make about their professional, romantic and superhero futures now that they are leaving high school behind. Gwen is unsure if she can cope with Peter's fear of what may happen if they stay together and Peter is haunted by his promise to Gwen's father to keep her away from the dangers of his new life and the conflict this creates within himself. It is evident that Peter loves being Spiderman almost as much as he loves Gwen. It is a credit to the director and Andrew Garfield that we feel his pain at the cost and weight of the role as he considers the impact of it upon those he loves. The theme of 'with great power comes great responsibility' is Spidey's USP and it ramped right up in this film.The relationship between Gwen and Peter is portrayed with a casual grace, depth and believability (their real life coupling crosses naturally into film) and the on screen chemistry between Garfield and Stone is palpable. At times, the fact that the actors are so credible stops the film descending into laborious schmaltz.Andrew Garfield is excellent, both as Peter Parker and Webby, and conveys his alter ego with humour and cheeky charm. We really get the feeling that Spiderman is always just Peter Parker wearing a mask. It is by far my favourite portrayal of the friendly neighbourhood web-slinger.The love theme and exploration of the interaction in relationships continues with all the main characters. Max Dillon thinks he is a nobody and falls in fan-love with Spiderman after he rescues him, telling him he needs him. Harry Osborn loves Peter after the shared experience of childhood abandonment creates a bond between them that remains strong despite ten years apart. Sally Field's Aunt May is perfect as a woman struggling with the loss of her husband and the growing up of the nephew she raised. There is a spark between them which showcases yet more truthful chemistry between Garfield and his co-stars. I laughed out loud twice during the film, once when Aunt May almost catches Peter out during a Spidey twist of the cliché of a teenager almost getting caught in his bedroom and the other was seeing Spider-Man in action while suffering from the dreaded Man-Flu.With the exception of Rhino (who is a nonevent), the villains, like Sandman and others before them, in the Spidey universe are victims of circumstance and do not choose to become villains. Rather they allow life, rejection, betrayal and anger to shape them. Max Dillon's (Jamie Foxx) change to Electro is a little disappointing. Despite his power, there is little spark and his demise fizzles into the background. Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan - looking impishly cruel yet vulnerable) makes a late but show stealing appearance as the Green Goblin.At just over 140 minutes, it is a little too long, especially during the middle section which provides the emotional vehicle for the finale punch. I turned to my son several times during action sequences and said 'here we go', only for the film to return to its character driven core. It is essentially a love story with some superhero action scenes, whereas I tend to prefer my Spider-Man to be more.. Amazing. However, I sense that is all about to change and after the ending teaser for The Sinister Six, I'll definitely be at the front of the line for The Amazing Spider-Man 3.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pleasing Followup to a Great Reboot,"Having watched the last Spiderman Trilogy slowly spiral into barely above a B-Movie, I was worried that the reboot may follow it's path. Besides that, we all know that historically Marvel movies weren't as good; although Disney has done wonders to overcoming that stigma. I'm happy to say that I was not only pleasantly proved wrong, but I left with a sense of readiness for the next installment! Anyone that knows the older canon for Spiderman knows that Stone's role is pivotal, and I won't say more than that. Even though I was expecting most of what happened, it was fun to watch it all unfold, and it was great to see certain images in the background of future villains. Keep your eyes peeled for fun gadgets, people! The story moved expertly, the acting was on par, and the filmography was all done very well. Stone and Garfield kept the awkward teen chemistry going, which is exactly what I liked so much about the two of them in the first one.I'm honestly having a hard time saying much about this movie without giving anything away, so I'll simply say this was a great moment in single-hero Marvel Movies.All of that being said, there are always some cons to go with the pros. There were parts of the movie that felt slower than they had to be, not because I was being told any great point of story; it actually felt more like filler to me. I feel like the role of Osborn/Goblin should have been more significant than it was, and I hope the lack of gravity for this character means we'll see A LOT more of him down the road (this was hinted at, but again ... trying to avoid spoilers). Finally, I really feel like I need to know more about his parents. Not really for the plot of this film, but just based on how interesting and tangled (pardon the web pun) the back story could get.Losing two points might seem harsh for a bit of slow story and the less-than-there Goblin role, but I stand by my 8/10. It may be a personal bias, but the Goblin was one of my favorite villains and, in my opinion, one of the more important. Being both an enemy and a friend - a frenemy, if you will - makes me feel like we missed a lot that could have been.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
hated it,"i don't know who wrote script this but it sucks. They turned peter in to a mamby pamby mama's boy. The whole movie all he does is cry about his life and all the bad things that happened to him. He whines, he cry's he's indecisive and can't get his sh_t together, finally losing whats most important to him through his own inadequacies. This movie is the worst interpretation I've ever seen. Now, i love action movies and all the super hero movies, all of them. Except this one, it totally ruins spider man's thing. He's so limp wristed i was waiting for him to come out of the closet The cgi is top notch, the acting is so so.

A film which illustrated the comicality and empathetical nature of Marvel comics,"With much speculation about the success of this film, it surprisingly, yet thankfully, lived up to the billing! With expectation high despite the seemingly mediocre Amazing Spiderman it seemed impractical and implausible to believe this film would be any different. Yet with promises of a better script and storyline, it seemed as if the series was about to live up to its initially thought potential. This was already hyped up more so by the pretext of a more intricate storyline which was implied by the previous film's ending. So it proved. The storyline was better, and the bonus of empathy with villains really did not hurt its compelling case. All in all, a film that delivered what it promised...",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Unfortunately, this film is worth neither your time, nor your money.","Despite being a huge Spidey fan throughout middle school and high school, I did not go to this film with very high expectations. I enjoyed the first Amazing Spider-Man, though I didn't think it was nearly as well done as many of the other Marvel-based films. Unfortunately, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 did not even meet my fairly low expectations.The absolute worst aspect of this movie is the writing. Every single character arc felt extremely unnatural and awkward. I found myself not caring what happened to any of the characters, including Spider-Man. The majority of the lines in this film were extremely awful. I was painfully eager for nearly every scene to be over so that I could gain some respite from the awkwardness and pointless nature of the scenes. The first film was campy, sometimes annoyingly so, but overall, the story was well written. That is not the case with this sequel. The only redeeming aspect is that there are about 2-3 scenes where the jokes are genuinely funny.Another aspect that was immediately annoying was that the action scenes felt chaotic and hard to follow, especially at the beginning. It seemed like they were all too close; as though someone had zoomed in too far with the camera. I did not notice if this continued throughout the film because I honestly stopped caring about the results of any of the conflicts less than half way through the movie due to the awful story.Even with low expectations, this film did not even prove to entertain. It was simply difficult to sit through.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
stumbles over itself by trying to do too many things,"Crammed and cluttered sequel finds Peter Parker continuing to fight crime as Spider-Man, while also maintaining-or not-a relationship with Gwen Stacy, but then trouble begins: Parker is deeply conflicted about his feelings for Gwen; old childhood friend Harry Osborn returns and takes over his recently deceased father Norman's company which is bad news for everyone in N.Y.C.; born loser and disgruntled Oscorp employee Max Dillon has an accident that makes him a supervillain with a wicked agenda that doesn't make much sense, and that doesn't even sum up half of all the subplots going on in this superfluous comic book adaptation. Sloppy and meandering script could potentially be redeemed by a cast of this caliber, but there's too many characters, an infuriatingly unfocused narrative, and the director's attempt to stage big, grand action sequences is mediocre at best. Shows signs of life as it nears its conclusion, but up until then it goes in so many different directions that it's difficult to take any true enjoyment from it. Overlong, overwritten, and overdone, making this one of the more forgettable Marvel products. **",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""Not the treatment our friendly neighborhood Spidey deserves.""","High-octane action sequences and mind-blowing fight scenes were not enough to save the day from loosely presented content and clumsy story. At first, I was pretty excited to experience the new Spidey movie which was creating a lot of buzz. After all the trailers indicating 3 overwhelming Super-villains in one movie and announcements like ""HIS GREATEST BATTLE BEGINS"", I was quite sure that they must have learnt from the shortcomings of the previous installment and right choices will be taken for creating a better sequel. BUT, I was WRONG. This movie moves away from the being called a Superhero movie. With all the right content in the basket to make a superb 142 min blockbuster, the movie fails to pull the right chord and falls straight in the category of average. The 142 min run-time felt stretched and slow at times as the story presents emotional melodrama most of the time rather than putting other important and relevant stuff. A movie which had a potential to be the best Spidey movie till date but in the end it turns out to be a wasted opportunity.Would like to mention some positives after all that rage outburst:The 3D is really Awesome. The chemistry between Gwen and Peter. Spiderman feels fantastic. The best on-screen Spidey display till date. And last but not the least, the only part true to the word amazing were the breathtaking action sequences and fight scenes. Superb, fantastic and mind-blowing. Especially, the electro-soundtrack combo was too good. Really liked that concept. And that's it.Now lets look at the lots and loads of shortcomings: > It's a Superhero movie, Not a Chick Flick - How about putting some more time in developing the Super-Villains with story and character rather than keeping them on standby. > Creating the tense hero-villain relation which spreads the sense of threat and calls for Superhero treatment. Even this core stuff is seriously missing. > Peter Parker is a boy who tries to balance Spidey responsibilities and life as a normal guy. One who cannot hold on to a regular job, is short of cash, gets exploited at Daily Bugle by J. Jonah Jameson and lots of other troubles. That boy was nowhere to be found. > The Super-villain Trio - Electro, Green Goblin and Rhino was completely wasted. > Electro as the main antagonist is seriously wasted. His story and character development falls short and heavily underdeveloped. > Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn/ Green Goblin felt like one of the things done right in this movie. But the screen-time and space, which a villain like Green Goblin deserves is messed up. > Rhino is nothing more than a cameo. Simply putting, I didn't feel that sense of threat from Super-villains which is at core of any Superhero movie.When it got over, I was blank and disappointed. Tried to gather my thoughts and felt that lots of things were pushed and tried to fit in a single movie. But the effort to tie them together failed miserably due to over-emphasis on the emotions part taking away the space from more important and relevant stuff. One more thing which I would like to mention was the kid scene towards the end - the only emotion which was genuinely felt. Want to focus on emotions, bring more like this one instead of going for melodramatic ones. Was this made just to set table for the next one?? Was this a remake tried making a bold move to make a difference. Well if yes, it Does Not.Verdict: This one was better than the sequel but still disappointing. Feels like a rushed movie which tries to aim lots of targets with a single bullet but fails big time due to heavy overdose of Peter and Gwen Melodrama. I went to see a superhero movie, not a chick flick running around action sequences and wasted super-villains. This is not the Spider-Man movie fans deserve.

"Big, bold and shallow","Bigger, bolder or just banal?In this latest instalment the man insect is facing a corrupt giant corporation where as a result of their recklessness and cover up an employee is turned into some sort of electricity monster.Since the box office results justify this, the makers continue on the theme of turning a kind, gentle, ordinary human being into a villain which Spiderman has got to face, so some inventiveness in the storyline would have been appreciated. In addition to this and in order to spice up the story a bit our hero has to come to terms whether his relationship with the girl he loves is viable or to terminate it so that he can protect her.Aside from the rather unsophisticated storyline, the spectacle will not disappoint. It is both bold and ambitious with spectacular effects giving some grand action scenes.When I went to the big screen, I went to see some eye popping action and to a satisfying extent, this is what I got, so I can slightly overlook its faults.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
unnecessarily long and a total waste of a good character,"Back in may,I had a chance to see the movie and I was too much excited about this movie when I had watched the trailer and promos for this movie I was sure I will watch this in theater but what I found is the total waste of my money there was no a great story line as compared to the character and an unnecessarily romantic scenes which were not being matched to the movie.

Good but underwhelming,"I have just got back from seeing the Amazing Spider Man 2 here in the UK. Overall enjoyable. Storyline is good and expands on a few things from the first film. Performances from the main cast are good,especially DeHann as Harry Osborn. Some of the supporting roles could have been 'played down'a little though ( the governor/scientist in the prison being a prime example). However whilst watching the film I couldn't help thinking that I had seen the film already. Basically there is so much that has been put out online and in the numerous trailers that have been done, that i felt that I had seen every set piece already. This spoiled the enjoyment for me. I realise that I could go in without having viewed any of the saturation coverage for this film over the last six months or so, but sometimes I wish that the film makers would keep some of the best things back for the actual film. So a solid 6/10 rather than a probable 8 or 9 if they had kept some surprises for us.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Amazing Spiderman 2 is crowded yet fun!,"Amazing Spiderman 2 is crowded yet fun!Alright! May 2nd 2014 is approaching towards us, it's the day when our friendly neighborhood Spiderman will be hitting the silver screen once again with its freshest sequel to his 2012's reboot ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"". I got my hands on the pirated copy of The Amazing Spiderman 2, few days back, it's available on the Internet. Yaikks! Piracy alert! Yup, I downloaded it because I couldn't resist. The promos were so compelling and consuming, I just wanted to quench my irresistible desire for the web slinging action.This is not the first review on the Internet for this movie and people have called it ""perfunctory"", ""Waste of Time"" and ""Insipid"". But at the same time people have also given it glowing reviews calling it ""Inception of a great movie series"". I was blown away by the first Sam Raimi's Spiderman Movie and I was quite disappointed by the reboot that happened 2 years back. However, I think the director Mark Webb has hit the right spot this time. Andrew Garfield shines as both Peter Parker and Spiderman. The one thing that stands out in the focus light is the ACTION! It's just phenomenal, some of the scenes are breath-taking and you will be completely engaged when the Spiderman jumps and slings from one building to another while dodging a homing missile at the same time kick goons and showcasing his acrobatics before he lands on the ground!When I saw the trailer, I was pretty sure that this movie is going to suck really bad as Electro is not something that fanboys would consider before Venom, Mysterio or Carnage but I was completely wrong. They've given Electro a fresh perspective, and the thing which really got me riled up for Electro was its presentation. I have one word for Electro's outlook ""COOL"", you will see its transparent skin under which the lightening is swimming and his eel like facial structure, everything about electro was a fit!The trailers posed 3 villains, Electro, Hobgoblin ad Rhino. And when I saw it, I thought it's going to be a crowded movie and the story won't be able to do justice to all the villains due to time constraint. I won't say the movie is not crowded but its not congested due to many villains, its because of the dragging emotional plot of Peter Parker. The plot goes back and forth on the same family and love-angle topics so many times that you will start to feel hammered. They could have just removed extra emotional culmination points.When it comes to super villains of this movie, in actuality, there is only one villain who got proper screen time, that's Electro. Rhino got the shortest, hobgoblin was hovering off-n-on. There are some really charismatic action scenes in this movie that every fanboy or even the fresh audience must watch. The action scenes are properly choreographed and they are long enough to consume the audience with almost nil shaky cams! Just an personal background - I have enormous hatred for unnecessary shaky cams during an action sequence, which are being used a lot these days to make it more engaging and I totally believe that it takes away the thunder of scenes and abundantly irritates the audience. Back to review - Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone's chemistry felt organic. Spiderman's humor was an untouched subject in Sam Raimi series, but here it is evident and actually works perfectly! His quips will actually make you giggle at times. Jamie Foxx has done a spectacular job in being the Electro! By the end of the movie, you will also palpate the assembly of the ""Sinister Six"" in the story line for future films.Verdict time! - The Amazing Spiderman is a fun movie to watch much better than its 2012 predecessor. The story could have been optimized and focused. There are sections of movie that will make you hate it, but the action scenes of this move will make you love it more! It's not going to be the best movie of 2014 but surely it is the beginning of something huge! I will call it ""Watchable without Ganja"".",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spiderman as he should be seen,"Well the boy spider struts his funky webs all over again and well, it was okay. You know me, a super-hero tart, my inner fourteen year old usually laps this stuff up (see my review of Winter Solider here) but Spidey, both in this incarnation and in the Tobey Maguire juggernaut, leaves me a little cold. Of course I'm being churlish. The visuals are incredible, the script sparkles, the acting is excellent. The 3D worked harder here, but it should really with the subject matter.The film opens with the familiar spider logo flexing on the screen as it becomes part of Spidey's suit as he plummets to the New York streets webs a-flying! Amazing. The story's good too, deeper than previously, but Spidey is still basically a teenager and precisely the things that appeal to that demographic put me off. The macho Roger-Moore-as-James-Bond patented good guy banter that punctuates the comics is here too, undermining the visuals and the reality - (yes I know it's a story about a boy bitten by a radioactive spider so it's not meant to be real!). When you're flying about trying to pick up lots of bouncing glass vials of plutonium would you really joke with the bad guy driver of the stolen truck? A suspension of disbelief too far - perhaps Spiderman just needs to secure it with a bit of his web.Andy Garfield gives a much more emotionally nuanced Spiderman and Emma Stone does a great job of being the sassy, clever and kick-arse heroine - she certainly has more dimensionality than Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson in the nerdier Tobey Maguire re-boot. Sally Field is a better Auntie May as is Martin Sheen as Uncle Ben, in fact the acting is seriously up a gear in this new re-boot with Jamie Foxx as Electro and Dane DeHaan as a slow-burning Green Goblin. But it still doesn't emotionally grip or have that slantways satirical lilt of the Avenger Assemble or Iron Man. And I think that's it, I love a Marvel superhero movie but I do like the satire, the great one- liners, the gentle mickey take of itself. Spidey's bad guys darknesses are undeveloped and untwisted, yes I know they're that way in the comics too. I want darker, nastier and altogether more conflicted bad guys I think and the Spidey Universe seems a little too simple.But The Amazing Spiderman 2 is brilliant entertainment with wondrous effects and explosions and lots of running, leaping and jumping. The little kid who used to watch the Spiderman cartoons as a kid on ITV would have totally loved it. Spiderman as a concept totally loved, brilliantly brought to the screen and envisaged, as good as this particular franchise gets. It is just that the original comic book didn't really delve into the depths like some of the other characters in Marvel.Does this lukewarm review mean I'm finally growing up? God, I hope not.(Four stars ****)",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"As a guy whose favourite superhero film is Spiderman 2, TASM 2 is really a big disappointment. But if you went in with very few expectations, you might as well like it.","Good things first:The musical grid beatdown between Spidey and Electro was certainly cool, so was every scene that featured Rhino, especially when Spidey juggles with the explosives (Sadly, only a mere 2 minutes). In the beginning when Spidey is swinging and doing his thing, we get this one camera angle which seems to be the POV of his balls. I wonder where they put the camera. Also, all the scenes where Spidey interacts with the NYC's residents, were awesome!Now the bad things:Too many sub-plot spoiled the movie. The sub-plots take a lot of time and don't really offer anything new. The main plot takes its toll because of that. Electro and Harry both turn into villains for apparently no real reason. Electro's digital VFX looked awkward in a film that's basically shot on film. Marc Webb, get back the Red Epic already! The movie switched genres often and that made it hard to follow. it didn't make it feel like a whole film but rather a compilation of scenes.Hans Zimmer really got it all wrong in this one. Playing TDKR in the opening plane scene and then playing the General Zod dubstep for Electro. Look we respect you and all and also you scored the awesome track of Inception, but really you can't use the same thing in all your movies.The cinematography was very contrasting. The swinging and aerial shots were awesome! But the action scenes had way too much flashing of lights and shaky cam, (which really is being overused nowadays).Verdict : As a guy whose favourite superhero film is Spiderman 2, TASM 2 is really a big disappointment.

Expected It To Be An Utter Crap & It Truly Lived Up To That Prediction.,"Expected it to be an utter crap & it truly lived up to that prediction. After opening with a pretty good prologue, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a downhill trip from there & follows Peter Parker enjoying his life fighting crime as Spider-Man but having hallucinations of Gwen Stacy's deceased dad whenever he is with her. But soon he has other things to deal with as new villains in town arrive starting with a Spider-Man obsessed fan who after a mishap mutates into Electro. Next comes Harry Osborn who later transforms into Green Goblin & last we have Rhino but the less I talk about this ass-wimp, the better it is.Director Marc Webb tries to do so many things at once in this sequel that the movie as a whole becomes entangled in its own webbing & not a single one of its sub-plots come out as well as one would've liked. The screenplay is dull, camera-work is more focused on 3D experience than contributing to the story, editing leaves so many unnecessary scenes in tact, VFX is where most of its quarter-billion budget seems to have been expended, the entire plot has no sense of direction, characterization is poor & even Hans Zimmer's music fails to deliver this time.The very few things likable about it is the new Spidey costume which now closely resembles the comic books look, the Gwen/Peter chemistry that's on or off throughout the film, Peter/Harry friendship that should've been further explored & the scenes involving Aunt May which feel most authentic on an emotional scale. The recurring cast has done the same job they did in the last film, adding nothing new to talk about in this one. Jamie Foxx hams his way through as Electro, Dane DeHaan has better moments as Harry than Green Goblin & Paul Giamatti's Rhino is far worse than imaginable.Oh n don't be blinded by the false advertisement as Electro plays the main villain, Green Goblin is present only during the final moments but not for too long & Rhino almost doesn't even exist in this film. On an overall scale, the 2nd chapter of this needlessly rebooted franchise delivers another lackluster cinematic experience & proves that the team has learned nothing from the mistakes it made in the last movie. Adding more extravagant elements into its production only to later end up choking on it, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is far less amazing than what it's selling itself as. Do yourself a favour & waste your money on something else.Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Mixed Bag but overall Worth it.,"This Movie Gets a lot of hate and frankly i don""t think it deserves it. There are some problems with it though. The Character of Electro was very poorly written and his motivations were very weak. He didn't really feel like a character and felt more like someone for Spider man to fight. Some of the Special Effects were not very convincing. The shots of Spider Man Swinging looked like they were pulled out of a video game. And there was just too many subplots and too many characters in the movie. However the action Scenes were quite exciting, the emotional scenes were touching and some of the characters were very compelling. Harry Osborn is a very strong character and you really feel His pain throughout the movie. The relationship Between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy was very well done. And this is an entertaining movie. Most of the Characters are likable and the pacing is good. Its not a masterpiece but its a fun ride. I'd say check it out.

"good, not great","Spiderman, Spiderman, Does whatever a spider can Spins a web, any size, Catches thieves just like flies Look Out! Here comes the Spiderman.We all love this theme song from the Spiderman TV series. Apparently, Spidey loves it too, so much that it is his ring-tone in The Amazing Spiderman 2. As like the previous film, Andrew Garfield's Spiderman is straight off the comic books- lissome, smarty pants, witty, and affable, everyday hero. The people's hero. But is it his greatest battle? Not really, even though he had to stop Electro, Green Goblin and the Rhino, all in the same movie.Like most superheroes, Peter Parker's struggles are within himself, to balance his obligations for his friends and family and his extraordinary responsibilities to New York City as Spiderman. With the back-story kind of done with in the first movie, director Marc Webb does not waste anytime but cuts straight to the chase. And chase it is in a breath- taking sequence as Spiderman saves bystanders, cops, foils a plutonium robbery while talking mushy with Gwen Stacy, at the same time. Things are not all hunky dory though, with Peter consumed with guilt over the possibility of Gwen being exposed to his adversaries, and his continued disturbance over his parents' disappearance. Adding to the volatility is the origin of his perhaps his most popular foe, Electro, and the emergence of Peter's best friend Harry Osborn.First the good- it is a great thing whenever Spidey is suited up. For when he does, he is either inducing guffaws with his one liners, or taking us on a roller coaster ride with his slow motion acrobatics and creative uses of his web-slinging capabilities. Andrew Garfield is a GREAT Spiderman, full of joi de vivre. Radiating nervous energy and childish enthusiasm, his chemistry with Emma Stone's Stacy is excellent. The visual effects are amazing, and the villains are suitably over the top, with Jamie Foxx's Electro getting maximum screen time, a hilarious Paul Giamatti as Rhino, and Dane DeHaan who turns into the murderous Green Goblin by the time you blinked. New Yorkers seem to love a show clapping and cheering their hero, and like a pro wrester, a show it is that Spidey gives them, every time a maniac pops up. People familiar with Spiderman canons will know the fate that awaits Gwen Stacy and so the rest of the movie plays out like a sappy teen romance drama, and largely a popcorn affair.The bad- there is too much happening. Two is company, three is a crowd. Three villains is an overkill, though in deference, Rhino just makes a special appearance in this, promising more in the next film. The narrative suffers from being the second movie in a planned trilogy, as a result it asks more questions than it answers. What is up with Richard Parker? What secrets will the hidden laboratory hold? Who is the man in the hat? Why is Oscorp the center of all mayhem?There is a deluge of superhero films, and I have a feeling The Amazing Spiderman 2 will get lost in the crowd, because it is good, but not great. No worries though, redemption coming right up in 2016, and villain list is set to include the Rhino, Vulture and Doc Ock- 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

I never thought Electro could be on non-animations. But this movie crashed my perception. It did it!If you are a visual-maniac, Spidey 2 would be good choice for you. :)However it was screwed up by ""poor"" story. Poor story does not mean simple story. In this case, it was too much complex for hero action movie. It makes me not able to focus on the visual. There were so many unnecessary stories :(If the story was simple enough, overall rating could be better.Overall score : 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A film comic book fans will love but tries too hard,"Consider Christ in the Garden of Gethsemene. He didn't want what was to come to happen, but He knew it had to happen.The same sentiment is echoed in ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"", as we find ourselves knowing deep down exactly what has to happen, but we don't want it to.For comic book aficionados, or at least people who know anything about the comics, we know exactly what we're referring to, but you still have to see it for it to sink in. Which is what makes this film, in one sense, a very powerful story and a strong addition to the franchise.On the other hand, this film is suffering from the same affliction that ""Spiderman 3"" did: sub-plot-itis.We have Max Dillon, an electrical engineer with serious social issues who becomes Electro, Harry Osborn, Peter Parker's friend who eventually becomes the Green Goblin, and then we have the whole Peter-Gwen Stacy- Spider-Man trio going on all at the same time.There's one more villain that gets thrown in at the very end, but let's not beat a dead horse. It seemed that the people at Sony and Columbia Tristar have forgotten the lessons that forced them to reboot the Spider-Man franchise in the first place.Make it, and fans will come. Don't try too hard, or you'll end up shooting yourself in the foot. Again.While this film hardly does that, it does sound a word of caution to the creators. There is certainly sequel material, but look what happened with 'third time's a charm' last time.In short: fans of the comics will love this film. Serious film buffs may not like it for its fairly shallow and predictable character development. However, by the time you leave the theater, you will be filled with conflicting emotions over what you just saw.And that's a good thing, in this case.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A one time watch...,Went over to see The Amazing Spider-Man 2 with my 4 year old daughter last weekend. To be honest the film is a bit of a let down with a lot of unwanted characters. There is nothing special in the movie which will make you think about watching it for a 2nd time. The chemistry between Andrew Garfiled and Emma Stone is the highlight of the movie. And obviously there is the usual thrills and spills one would associate with a Spiderman movie. Action sequences I felt was a bit overboard sometimes..Kids will love it for sure not so much with adults I would assume. Although I must confess that I am much more of a Tobey Maguire Spiderman fan than the one portrayed by Andrew Garfield.,7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

The weakest web,"If The Amazing Spiderman from 2012 felt like an unnecessary reboot so soon after the original trilogy was completed then this sequel is not going raise much hope for this cycle of films.Andrew Garfield is certainly a zippy and smart Alec web spinner, Emma Stone is an appealing Gwen Stacy but then you rush into the villains where character development reminded more of Batman & Robin.Harry Osborn is introduced as the new heir of Oscorp and a good friend of Peter Parker, something not mentioned in the previous film. Jamie Foxx starts to give an electrifying performance but we never really understand his hatred of Spiderman. Surely he should take out his anger on Oscorp who made him like this and stole his ideas.Still the villains set up some action packed finale, however you feel once Electro is dealt with the Green Goblin will show up leading to another overwrought and frankly dull showdown.New writers have been brought in for the sequel but there is nothing fresh her just a run of the mill action film and not a good one at that.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"This pointless waste of a sequel is even worse than the first one! But, is there any redemption here?","""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" (2014), as if one pointless reboot film wasn't bad enough. They had to vomit this worthless sequel in our mouths! Not surprisingly, this ""movie"" sucks and is even worse than the first one. Being the Spider-Man fan I am, I decided to give it a chance. I thought to myself: ""yeah, these film makers have should have learned from their mistakes. There's plenty of room for improvement!"" Sure enough, it's every bit as terrible as the first one and even worse in most aspects. ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" has a convoluted and dull storyline, average to horrible acting, and a generic predictable soundtrack to try and tie this diarrhea stain together. The plot is, Spider-Man/Peter Parker tries to investigate the death of his parents, while at the same time protecting Gwen Stacy, dealing with the villainous Electro and even the return of his childhood friend Harry Osborn/Green Goblin. Even those aren't all the villains, no, he also comes across the Rhino! Right off the bat, just from reading the story synopsis, it's obvious how overly complex it is. There are way too many subplots and too many villains. It's all too much for one movie! But, that's only scratching the surface. The plot is forced and for the majority of the time, next to nothing happens. That's right, a ""film"" as overstuffed as this one has next to nothing to offer, and it just leaves you feeling empty in the end. On top of that, it's just boring and unpleasant to watch. At 141 minutes in length, it's longer than the first movie and every second is completely wasted. I'll tell you one thing, the end credits were a sight for sore eyes! Granted, ""Spider-Man 3"" (2007) had three villains like this ""film"". That being said, that movie is written and executed so much better than this trainwreck. ""Spider-Man 3"" gets the job done, and then some. One thing I always say is, you can't put too many villains into a movie. I always say, one or two villains max is sufficient enough. Anything more than that, is way too much and it leads to convoluted execution as well as unresolved storylines. Now, it is possible to have more than two villains in a film. But, you have to be an expert when it comes to writing the script. Otherwise, the movie will inevitably crash and burn. Bottom line, everything that occurs in ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" could have been split into two, if not three standalone movies. It's in the same boat as ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016). Just like the way that film suffers, why did they squeeze so much into just one movie? Why? The golden rule of film making, is to always keep it simple. With simple plots, the audience gets more invested in what's going on. Unfortunately, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is the epitome of convoluted and complex. As for the acting, it's just as horrible as the story. Of course, Andrew Garfield's acting sucks, which is a given for the movies he somehow gets roped into. If you thought he was bad in the first one, you haven't seen anything yet. Just looking at him on the screen makes my skin crawl, let alone when he speaks! Pretty much every single syllable uttered from him just makes me cringe painfully. Now granted, I'm sure Andrew Garfield is a nice person in real-life. He just needs to pick a different career! Sadly, most of the acting from the rest of the cast is pretty much just as bad as his. The only ones who seem to be trying are: Emma Stone, Sally Field, Jamie Foxx, Felicity Jones and Campbell Scott. Everyone else is just awful with their attempts at acting. The sad thing is, most of these actors and actresses do well with their acting in other films and shows! What happened to them here? As far as the soundtrack goes, it's about as generic as you can possibly get. The most shocking thing about this film score, is that it was written and composed by Hans Zimmer, Pharrell Williams, Johnny Marr, Mike Einziger and Junkie XL. Yep, you're reading this right, five people composed the music for this ""movie"", and it still came out terrible! How is that possible? You would think that at some point during the writing and composing, one of them would've said: ""hey I don't like the way this sounds, maybe we should make some improvements."" The film score does have some decent parts. But overall, it's just a huge letdown. Not even Hans Zimmer, one of my top ten all-time favorite film score composers, could save it. Maybe the good parts were written by him? Who knows? Any way, let's move on to the only two good elements in this piece of crap. The only good things are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are great and give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. You can't go wrong with filming your movie in New York City! As far as the special effects go, they are well-done and still hold up today. Which is no surprise, being made in 2014! ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is nothing but an entirely pointless sequel of a pointless reboot franchise that nobody asked for. Just thinking about this ""film"", as well as the first one, just makes me feel unclean. I'm struggling to give this ""film"" 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Obviously, telling you to stay away from this ""movie"" should be clear enough based on my review. But, should you feel the need to subject yourself to this waste of cinema, be sure to bring a barf bag. The only bright side is, I'll never have to watch this ""film"", or the first one ever again!",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not as Bad as I thought it was,"Okay. I just literally watched this movie. What are we in 2022?? CrazyThe first time I watched this movie. First of all. I'm a die hard Spider-man fan. Even if the movie is crap I'll go watch it in theaters. Like just have toAnyways. This one made me so mad that I walked out of theaters. So I never really saw the whole thing.Fast forward 8 years. I still was kind of bummed when I started it. It's really corny at first and then Gwen comes along. I'm like oh here we go more teenage dramaBut dang! Emma Stone can act! I mean she kept this movie grounded. Even with dealing with the Russian and Max. (Max really brought me back to Jim Carey's Riddler. That's how much I wanted to skip it)The dialogue between her and Andrew is beyond anything Tobey and Kirsten had. I got into it.And Harry Osbourne. I was very surprised. From the cover he looks like an Emo version. But he has strong motivation in this movie and he feels real. Like a rich friend I could have. I mean yeah he played the part well.The ending is sad. Not gonna spoil it but even though I was mad at the writers, they redeemed themselves through Aunt May and Gwen. It really tied it altogether.It was corny and over the top many times but it felt real. It really felt real.So for that reason I give it 6 stars. Not the best Spider-Man. That still goes to Tobey in Spider-Man 2. But this is like number 3 or 4 for me including the Holland ones.So yeah give it a try. I'm glad I finally did. I actually just clicked purchase on ITunes.

Honestly Great! #justiceforandrewgarfield,"Alright, for starters, I'll say it! ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" movies with Andrew Garfield are superior to the Tobey Maguire ""Spider-Man"" films. There. That's out of the way. Trust me, I grew up with the original Maguire ""Spider-Man"" and the nostalgia factor keeps them close to my heart. However, substance and visual effects staying power they lack. I give it up to BOTH ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" movies for introducing audiences to lesser known villains. It was a risk, and most people didn't like it, but it pays off to viewers who want to appreciate something different. The acting in this film was hands down the best in any of the 5 ""Spider-Man"" movies to this date (therefore, not including Tom Holland's films). Garfield gives everything to this role and the story of Peter Parker is told so humanly and organically with this film. The growth in character makes sense. Not just for him, but for Gwen Stacy as well. Talk about a great change. Unlike MJ or Gwen Stacy from the Maguire films, this Gwen Stacy actually knows she is intelligent and won't allow herself to sit in a corner and be sad for 2 movies straight (sorry, not sorry - but that was literally MJ in ""Spider-Man 2 & 3""). Anyway, the connection between Garfield and Stone is undeniable and incredibly relatable. I love the introduction of a ""new"" villain (Electro) and bringing in an ""old"" (known) villain (Goblin). The visual effects are beautiful and a work of art, this movie is 8 years old now and it looks like it was made this year. Now, stopping comparing them to the first Triology. These films are wonderful. Great acting. Great character development. Great stories. Great ""new"" (and ""old"") characters. Great takes on developing story arch's. Wonderful visuals. A must see film. Worst thing to say, once in a while, I felt the movie drag out scenes a little too long. But I'd say that happened, maybe 3 times throughout the whole movie. Again, this was like watching a comic book come to life and play out on screen. No characters were wasted or thrown in out of ""fan service"" (Gwen Stacy in original). Characters stayed true from first film to the end of this film, unlike the original Triology movies characters (who changed dramatically for story purposes only and it was jarring from an audience perspective). Overall, this is a great movie. I think #justiceforgarfieldsspiderman needs to become a trending tweet, cause honestly, he's pretty fantastic!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very underrated,"*WARNING CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS* I was one of the rare few who found the first Amazing Spider-man movie to be really good, so I was definitely looking forward to asm 2. I wasn't disappointed. This did what a good 2 movie should do, it gave us a really good villain. Electro was a great villain, who was very menacing. Harry Osborn was another great villain, and he had a clearly explored back story and motivation. Combine the two and you get the perfect villain. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are still in-arguably great as the leads, and their chemistry together is top-notch. The effects are even better this time around (which is really saying something), and these are possibly the best effects I've ever seen. This movie keeps a great tone, in that it has some funny moments, but it knows when to be serious, and that's the tone I want from a Spider-man movie. I'm still not 100 percent sure how I feel about Gwen's death. It made a nice conclusion to the series, but if they had wanted to make more, they would've needed Gwen alive. There are a few too many plot-lines, and that's why I rate this a bit under the first movie, but I still give the story a thumbs-up. In conclusion, I think this movie was really good, with great characters, perfect visual effects, a good story, that occasionally got too muddled, and a good tone. I was really sad to hear that this great series was getting thrown out to make way for another bland MCU movie with forced humor and no tension. This could've been one of my top five favorite trilogies of all time, now it'll be my favorite double-feature. This was a great send off to a great series.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Rhino was in it for 2 seconds...,"I thought the first ""Amazing"" Spider-Man film was extremely tepid, but then again much of that was just re-telling the whole story of Peter's origin all over again, so I thought this one had to be a step up, but boy was I wrong... For starters they cram in three underdeveloped villains, none more so than the Rhino, who literally appears there for about 2 seconds. No seriously, they just cram him into the final five minutes of the film with about 2 seconds of actual combat and as soon as Spider-Man is actually about to land a punch the film immediately ends. I honestly think it should be illegal for them to even include the Rhino in the adverts and poster if he is given this much screen time, under false advertising. Similarly, the Green Goblin is often ranked as the number one villain for Spider-Man in many polls and again was given just one short 3 minute fight with Spidey before being defeated. Electro actually had some development but it actually undermined the characters motives: basically he was a huge Spider-Man fan met him, saw that Spider-Man was on a big TV and decided to try and kill him (no seriously, this is exactly what happened) It was also cringe worthily cheesy during any actual slight sniff of combat: including Spider-Man pulling down a robbers underwear and wearing a firefighter's helmet when stealing a hose to spray Electro There are so many other plot holes and flaws it's best to just list the main ones here or I'll be here all day, so: 1. Electro looks and acts nothing like in the comics (particularly the fact he's a black guy in a hoodie) 2. The Rhino is a robot that appears for 5 seconds 3. Spider-Man has an infinite supply of his webbing 4. Oscorp is literally the most ridiculous company of all time, they almost killed everyone in the city on countless occasions and even mention how they had to get rid of all animal experiments only for Electro to be turned into what he was by some fish (another animal) 6. Harry has no understanding of any medical science whatsoever and is completely oblivious of any possible problems with just injecting himself with a random blood/chemical sample. 7. Gwen acts as if she's already secured a place at uni when all she is doing is being interviewed and then the second the interview is over they send her on a jet to England 8. A mother decides to send her kid to watch a terrorist shoot at police and destroy the city just because he likes to dress up as Spider-Man. Overall, a horrible mess of a very cheesy movie compounded by the 2 seconds of action involving the Rhino. AWFUL!!!",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Late to the party,"7 yesrs later I'm finally seeing this for the 1st time. I did love the 1st Garfield outing as Spider-man and finally saw this after seeing No Way Home 2 times this week. Garfield was a great Spider-man and really deserved better than Amazing Spider-man 2. The best parts of this movie are when Gwen and Peter are together. The villians are lackluster. Electro was horrible and completely ridiculous. They try to make you feel bad for him which is done well in some pre-Electro scenes but falls flat in other scenes. Green Goblin was atrocious and turning him into an actual monster was blah and unnecessary. The mentally disturbed version would have worked a whole lot better without the hereditary disease monster transformation. Overall, it's a miss for me and a one and done viewing is enough. Nothing Spectacular about this Not-So-Amazing outing.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A visual extravaganza,"I wasn't up for a reboot of the Spiderman franchise prior to this movie & after seeing it, it did change my opinion but only just. And I'd describe that with some pros & cons.It was a very efficient adaptation and I appreciate that about it. In addition to web-slinging, wall crawling and a Spider sense, we also get witty banter with villains and criminals alike as well as a suit upgrade. As a huge fan of the comics as a child, my biggest attractive characteristic of Spiderman is his ability to churn up amazing one-liners with super-villains even in the midst of unfavorable circumstances. In the previous movie, the attempt at this was a hit and miss and very tacky at best but Andrew Garfield seems to have done his homework with this one.All actors did a very good job. I didn't find the non-action sequences a drag & they did well to drive the movie forward. My star performer is Jamie Fox as well as Sally Field.As for the tone, Spiderman is not Batman and most certainly not the dark knight either. A brilliant teenager with spectacular superhuman abilities on the big-screen... In my opinion, its allowed to be a bit over-the-top and not quite as childish as other reviewers claim..On the other hand, the big screen effect could have been more amazing without half of the movie being included in the trailers. There was no room for surprises. Non whatsoever. Not even in the climax battle. If for anything, the end battle was anti-climatic as I've seen it in the Trailers over & over again.The worst part for me was the climax battle. It was so crammed up you could hardly figure out what's happening anywhere. It just seemed like a skits show of visual effects blitz.Better than previous installments but couldn't match Spiderman 2.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Down Came the Rain,"Greetings again from the darkness. This follow-up to The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) seems to have the mission of throwing as much onto the screen as possible. There are not one, but three key villains, a teenage love story, a deathbed scene, numerous moments of soul-searching, a stream of wise cracks and puns, the most outrageous laboratory setting, a cartoonish evil doctor accent, the furrowed brow of Aunt Mary (Sally Field), flashbacks and video of the mysterious father, teasers for future movies, and of course, enough action and special effects to ward off any thoughts of peace.Personally, I find Andrew Garfield to be a nice fit as Spidey, but I just can't buy him as ultimate science geek Peter Parker. He bumbles about and bats his eyes too much for my tastes, and can't stand toe to toe with Gwen Stacy (real life squeeze Emma Stone) in scientific banter. Still, the original story is interesting enough that any minor issues are easily overlooked.At its core, this entry is a story of revenge. The foundation for Peter Parket's troubles all stem from Oscorp, so we are treated to some behind the facade sets that will keep viewers on their toes. After an initial face-off with bad guy Aleksei Sytsevich (a maniacal Paul Giamatti), we see the transformation of goofy Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) into the shocking (get it?) Electro. If that's not enough, childhood buddies Peter Parker and Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) are reunited to set the stage for more good vs evil.The story would have benefited from more concentration on any of these three stories, while dropping one altogether. The viewer would have benefited from a slower jolt (one more!) in the transformation of Max to Electro. We needed to find the humanity, rather than just desperation. The same goes for Peter and Harry. The dots are a bit too far apart for connection, though DeHaan (so good in Lawless and Chronicle) is a striking contrast to the doe-eyed, beautifully coiffed Garfield.It's nice to see Stone's Gwen portrayed as a smart, ambitious young woman who also understands how demanding a relationship is, and the responsibility that goes with dating a superhero. Speaking of responsibility, the lack of Uncle Ben's influence here is disturbing, though probably necessary given the exploration of backstory on Peter's parents (Campbell Scott, Embeth Davidtz).When Paul Giamatti reappears near the end as Rhino, it's a bit difficult to not think ""enough is enough"". And oddly, this fight sequence ends abruptly, evidently setting the stage for future Spidey. And speaking of the future, the end credits scene plays as nothing more than a teaser trailer for the next X-Men movie, while robbing us of any details to the Sinister Six.Admittedly, I feel somewhat overdosed on Superhero and Comic book adaptations, yet the action and effects are still quite fun to watch, even if director Marc Webb (Ok, that pun is too easy) seems to jumble up too many story lines.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Ah, the good old days","I'll start with this: This movie is for teenagers only! Why? Because we (30up) remember all too well the 3 Raimi films. They were good. No, they were more than good. So here we are now. It's 2014 and we find ourselves watching part two of this pretty unnecessary re-boot*. Why unnecessary you ask? Well... Spider-Man 1 was a wonderful film. In two hours Sam Raimi introduced us to the beautifully crafted world of Peter Parker: - Peter turning into Spider-Man (entertaining) - His job as a photographer and his awful boss (good comedy) - Mary Jane Watson (fit the part nicely) - Aunt May (could she have been any sweater?) - His friend Harry O. (good fit) - Norman Osborne/ Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe was the perfect choice)Sam found time to fit all of this into the first movie and it fit perfectly. That was some beautiful storytelling! The flow, the action, the cast... Awesome. And he pulled off the same with part 2!!But those days are gone. With The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (and one), we get similar elements put together in a different way, but not in the same quality. It feels like one of those dance-floor remixes of classic songs. They are new and shiny and (by some people considered) cool, but really you just wish they would play the original.My summary? The Amazing Spider-Man is not a bad movie... it's just inferior to the original in every way possible. That's it.*Don't think that I'm against all re-boots on principle. Total Recall didn't bother me at all. It's just that a re-boot should not be done with franchises that are 5-10 years old. That's way too early. (Hear that 'Fantastic Four'??)",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Hmmm Not quite,Well to begin with had high hopes on this especially with electro being the villain the problem with that is there just isn't enough on him to make him a substantial villain or one you are likely to remember in fact i remember the bad guy who turns into rhino more than electro.Far too much lovey dovey stuff it takes away a real feel to a superhero movie they all have them but in the right amounts this was 60% love dovey 25% no one knows what was going on and waste of film and the other 15 % was brilliant great move stuff.All in all if ya a big spidey fan i reckon you will be the only ones who rate this as a great film as for the acting brilliant i just feel that some people have to play out director wise how mushy a super hero movie really is sorry but i hope number 3 is better cause this was far worse than number 1 IMO,6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A fun watch but a pretty standard super hero movie,"I've been looking forward to this movie for quite a while. I really enjoyed the first of the franchise and thought they really nailed Peter Parker and Spidey.The movie itself is a pretty solid, super hero action flick. The film looks great, the action sequences are good and you are (in your head) cheering Spidey on! That being said I found Max/Electro a pretty dorky villain. I'm not convinced he has enough of a reason to use his newly found powers they way he does. The crescendo also came across a little half baked in points.There are some nice references in there for comic book fans to spot.All in all it's a fun ride and fans of the first will no doubt enjoy it.

An Amazing Hero with an Amazing and Powerful Romance,"I watched a lot of superhero movies and this one is in my top 3 along with The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. I see all the bad reviews saying bad things about spidey, about Andrew Garfield and comparing this to Twillight. I really do not get those people. Let me tell you why.Firstly because Andrew Garfield fits perfectly for the role of Peter Parker and also does Emma Stone for Gwen Stacy. A real, honest love between these two characters. It is so powerful that I felt it when they look at each other, talk to each other and in every other romantic scene. I know you expect a great superhero movie with a lot of action, with a good villain but this movie is something more than just a superhero movie. This is a really great romance that in the end it almost made me cry.Another thing about this movie is that I really like the villain and Jamie Foxx was really good at being Electro. Not much action and battles between spiderman and Electro but that is what makes this superhero movie so special.And the last thing may contain a little spoiler(do not read it if you want to watch the movie for the 1st time). It has an really amazing twist at the very end when Gwen dies and like I said it almost made me cry. So I can not wait for the 3rd movie of this trilogy.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is Spider-man film or I just watch another Teen Fiilm?,"I can't say I went in to the theater with high hopes. The first reboot, I kind of like it. But like my guess, this TASM 2 mess every thing up. After seeing the first trailer I thought it seemed like a total mess, and I wasn't convinced by Electro one bit. Unfortunately I was spot on, I hoped to at least get an enjoyable time at the cinema with my friends, but ended up feeling quite uncomfortable and laughing throughout most of the film.Garfield and Stone has their chemistry and does their best with the incredibly thin script and cheesy one-liners, but their potential quite beautiful scenes together gets lost in the over-full and messy plot. I can't buy an emotional scene that is interrupted by heavy dub-step and a blue electric guy. Their love scene is to much for me, It like see another Twilight film in the theater. I don't like Mary Jame of the first trilogy, but still love the emotion from Peter to her.And About the villain, Electro - stupid, dumb ass, don't know any word to described it. Green Globin - Jerk, Peter don't give you his blood so you wanna kill him, after use the poison you still wanna kill him WTF. With this villain, how it can't be better than the old Spider-man 3.The point I like is the battle, yeah It is good, can't deny it. Spider man is funnier, smarter, but can't look like a nerd in comic book so good like Tobey, and how this nerd can't make the most beautiful girl in the school love him, show me please :D.

"It's Great For Stunts and Action, Otherwise Dull","I watched The Amazing Spiderman 2 last night. It was exactly as I have come to expect a Marvel movie to be: ridiculous bad guys, stunts, explosions and a bit of back story to keep us relatively interested. It does exactly what it says on the tin; I think if you REALLY criticise it, then it's not your type of film anyway.That said, the dialogue was not particularly snappy, the plot was utterly predictable and most of the acting wasn't that great. Jamie Foxx went through the motions (as much as you can when you're playing an electrified bloke with a vendetta) and every time I look at Andrew Garfield I see Andy Murray and think to myself ""boring"". Dane DeHaan was suitably unhinged as Harry Osborn but unfortunately had very little back story, and Emma Stone was, as usual, gorgeous. I did however find myself a bit bored every so often when I saw ANOTHER long shot of Spidey jumping off a building.It's not a bad film; just that there's not much point to it.

Slightly Better than #1But Way Too Much Romantic Emotion,"Stunning Spidey SFX and an impressive Production all around highlight this Sequel that comes off, overall, better than the first one. But the enormous amount of Romantic Angst, combined with the Parker Family's suffering from loss, is a bit much for a Super-Hero Movie and the Melodramatics and Emotional tugging bring this one down. There's just too much internal turmoil for this type of thing.The Story outside the Personal Stuff is OK and there are layers upon layers of interesting happenings. Jamie Foxx's ""Electro"" is flashy and fantastic at times. The CGI is bright, glaring, and gaudy, but works nonetheless. There are many other Characters in an around Osborn Corp. Harry (Dane DeHaan) shows up. So does His Dad briefly.Oscorp is shown to be an Evil breeding ground for present and future Super-Villains like Rhino, who makes a Cameo and there are hints of others. Overall, an acceptable entertainment, but these Comic-Book Movies have become such a huge part of the Cinematic Lexicon that expectations are high every time out and Fanboys are always pushing for perfection.This one was considered a Flop, both commercially and critically, and #3 is a no go.

"Finally, a great Spidey movie that's not Spider-Man 2!","As a fan of Marvel, Spider-Man is one of their best in my opinion. The comics are great, the film adaptations, however, I'm not that fond of. Spider-Man was just OK, Spider-Man 2 was flawless, Spider-Man 3 was really bad, and The Amazing Spider-Man was good, but not memorable. I walked in the theater with semi-high expectations, because I read some reviews and was skeptical about it. However, it was actually fantastic, and is definitely going in the best Marvel movies ever made. I was surprised by the performances of Dane DeHaan(Green Goblin), and Andrew Garfield(Spider-Man), both fitting their roles very well.The special effects are spectacular and imaginative, particularly the web-slinging scenes and Electro's skin. I have an issue with Paul Giamatti's performance as Aleskei Systevech/Rhino and the Sony marketing, but TAS2 is still very awesome and underrated. Even my mom enjoyed it, who doesn't like Spider-Man!

Twilight in a red and blue leotard,Everyone whom gave this a rating greater than 6 (and I am being generous) needs to contribute to my ticket refund.

They must have a checklist: Lame jokes from the protagonist when he should be spending more time stopping criminals. Half the screen time focused on teenage angst romance. Suicidal spectating masses that clap and cheer their impending doom. Child mascot (probably a producer's kid).Pros: good effects and cinematography.

People need to understand the story better,"The movie was one of the best Spider-man movies that I have every seen. The special/visual effects were amazing. The chemistry between the main cast was very good. Particularly the relationship with Gwen and Peter. The movie sometimes would have moments in which you knew Sony executives put there noses into like the plane scene. Also there was a lot of set up for the Sinister Six movie. Andrew Garfield is the best as Peter Parker. Sony should not change him. Mark Webb should have added more first person scenes as seen in the The Amazing Spider-man Trailer and movie.

Not all that Amazing.,"Good movie but they are trying to do way too much with it. Character building was way too fast with certain characters. Story line is set up to be in the past to explain then jumping to the future to present time in order to find out what was going on with his father. Like I said way too confusing but it is that fast. There was barely any time to build Harry Osborn up at all. And one character was introduced as himself then the villain. That's all I really have for now because I do not want there to be any spoilers. Not to mention the movie was 2 hours long with some action sequence in it, visually it was amazing like the title, but as an actual story line...meh",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Comedy of Errors!,"Synopsis: The Amazing Spiderman Peter Parker runs a crusade against foes like Electro and Green Goblin whom he sends packing before the end of the movie in his distinctive style.Review: The Spiderman Series has been one of the greatest hits in the history of 'Hollywood'. Unfortunately, in contrast 'The Amazing Spiderman 2' turned out to be the lowest earning entry in the franchise. To put in a few straight words, the movie was drab and dragged across its span of 142 minutes unlike the previous stints. The movie starts with an incident in the distant past of Peter Parker, explaining the circumstances of their missing in Peter's childhood. The movie then takes a leap into the current life of Peter Parker, a man in his 20s.This jump can surely be uncomfortable for those viewers those who have not watched the prequel of the sequence. This movie tried to impart sense of humor by gimmicks like 'Spiderman ring-tone in serious situations', which disturbed the action and didn't fell in well with the audience, at least me. It looked cheap and undesirable. The movie has logical lapses at some places that decreases interest in the movie. Peter's first meeting with Max(one of villains known as Electro) is one such instance. The movie tries to bring in romantic elements but they die out before climax or conclusion. Intense action scenes are also lacking in the movie, unlike the previous versions. Thus the movie fails to quality either as ""action"", ""romance"" or ""thriller"" or ""tragedy"". During the later half the movie becomes predictable and there is nothing much left for the audience to speculate. The movie also has some positive points. It is a good watch for those who are those who are ""die-hard"" spider-man fans. The Cinematography in the movie is awesome with some breath-taking shots. It could have been another blockbuster, had the story been more absorbing and realistic.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Chappy Watched: The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"It is such a difficult task to beat the sheer cinematic brilliance that was the original Spider-Man trilogybut somehow they manage.If I didn't think so in the first movie, this movie confirmed for me that Andrew Garfield is the perfect choice to play Peter Parker. The thing that captured my attention in this movie is that it doesn't feel like he is acting, it's feels like that is his actual personality and traits.The same can be said with Emma Stone. When those two share a scene together, it's like they aren't acting at all.This movie has a lot of foreshadowing to the future Spider-Man movies and the planned spin- offs and even references and small appearances by characters that may or may not live up to their comic destiny in this universe.Something I also liked was the new Green Goblin costume. This version has a sense of realism to it, something you can see an actually villain wearing, not some cartoon character costume like the William Dafoe/James Franco costume looked like.There is a scene between Peter and Aunt May that is just remarkable! Certainly shows you why Andrew Garfield is where he is now and why Sally Field has been nominated and won so many awards in her acting career!If you are a fan of comic books and/or the first Amazing Spider-Man, well you probably would have already seen this, but if you haven't than you should get on that! This will definitely be a Day 1 purchase for me.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
About as good as the 1st,"I had pretty high expectations for The Amazing Spiderman 2 going in and for the most part it really didn't disappoint me. I love Andrew Garfield as Pete Parker and Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey as well as some of the varies side character like aunt May. I really loved the first Amazing Spiderman when it was released. I loved seeing a new much more believable take on really every character that was in the original Raimi trilogy (peter, Gwen, aunt May and Uncle Ben just for example). I found all these characters to be very likable and actually useful and intelligent unlike in the Raimi trilogy.The amazing Spiderman 2 definitely had a lot of the things I liked about the first one for example the creative way Peter uses his web shooters. I love watching him do things like putting his finger over one to make it shoot web in 2 different directions or like in the first movie when he used his web to find the lizard. I also like how Gwen Stacey is actually useful unlike Mary Jane. It's cool to see her try to find ways to help peter when he battles against the bad guys. I suppose its not official or anything but I think that aunt May knows Peter is Spiderman which is really cool because I'm pretty sure people close to him would be pretty suspicious.One thing that I really missed in this movie though was the lack of some of the side characters from the first one in particular Flash. I really liked how he started out as a jerk but turned out to be an okay guy.It was a smaller detail but I really liked the dynamics between him and Peter and I was hoping to see more of that. i have heard rumors though that Flash will become Venom in a future film so I hope that that is the case.Now I just want to give my opinion on some of the major complaints that I have heard.1. To many villains with sloppy under developed story arcs2. To much romanceI completely understand where both of these complaints come from but I have to disagree with them both. The Amazing Spiderman 2 was really more of a set up for future installments in the franchise which I know irritates people. For me though being a BIG fan of following long running TV shows and waiting all season for the big pay off of each season for whatever show I'm watching this did not bother me about the movie. I don't mind at all that this movie had a lot of set up because IMO it was an entertaining movie by itself as well. As for the romance all I really have to say is I didn't mind it because Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone work Pretty well together.So overall I really enjoyed The Amazing Spiderman 2 but I liked the first one just a little bit more. I also realize that I did a fair amount of trash talking about the Raimi trilogy which means that this review will automatically be rated down by a lot of people who see it... but oh well it's just my opinion on the 2 separate franchises.I give The Amazing Spiderman 2 an 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not so amazing,"Like it's predecessor, ironically named director Marc Webb's 'Amazing-Spider-Man 2' is a very frustrating film. There are a number of really good ideas, scenes and performances, but they're all held together by an over-stuffed and under-cooked story that clunkily moves along for a mind-numbing 142 minutes. It's curious that with that much screen time Webb is unable to work in rather important aspects of Peter's life, such as going to college (which is barely even hinted at, let alone shown) or his job with the Daily Bugle.Instead, the focus becomes split between the admittedly well handled love travails of Gwen and Peter and the development of two entirely new villains. Real life couple Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are quite good as the web slinger and his best gal, while Dean DeHaan manages to make co-villain Harry Osborne scary and sympathetic at the same time. Unfortunately his partner in crime, Jamie Foxx is horribly miscast as a milquetoast techno geek who dreams of becoming as popular and beloved as Spider-Man. Even worse is Paul Giamatti, who is downright embarrassing in a smaller role that is obviously a set-up for the next film.Like the drama, the action is also polarizing. On one hand, it's over-stylized and relies too heavily on slo-mo gimmickry, but yet it's thrilling to swing along through New York city with Spider-Man.Ultimately the 'The Amazing Spider-Man 2' is bogged down by trying to spin too many plates and undermined by a misplaced, and ultimately dissipated, focus.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Save your money,"The movie starts with promise and quickly descends into failure. The characters were underdeveloped, the story was disjointed,and our web- head spent the majority of the movie stalking his love interest.Electro gets his name and a nice pretty suit out of nowhere just like Peter's friendship with Harry. The dots in this story weren't connected by any means of the imagination.This movie feels like a crappier version of Raimi's Spider-Man 3 re- visited: One cool villain with great cgi, and the rest just sort of rushed and tossed in, (instead of a Crappy whiney Venom we got a crappy cartoony Rhino) thus overloading our hero's plate and our mind's eye.Once again Oscorp is at the center of our movie world and this apparently will be the continuing theme in this franchise, moving further and further away from comic canon.Most of what you saw in the trailers misleads the direction of the entire film, many scenes didn't even make the final cut. Basically if you saw the right trailer, you've seen the end.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Just like Spider-Man 3,"When I first saw the trailer for the movie last year I was thinking that this movie was going to be like Spider-Man 3 of the Raimi Spider-Man trilogy. Upon seeing it, man I was right, a lot of villains to begin with, too noisy for the action sequences, and too convoluted for the story line. Although I find the actions sequences truly amazing, the acting was as well superbly done; the only drawback was that the story lack depth like what happened to the conclusion of Raimi's trilogy. There was also this one scene where Electro (Max Dillon), played by the Oscar winner Jamie Foxx, emerges for the first time and I couldn't quite put it if the whispers of outrage obviously voiced by him was part of the musical score or not. This was somehow awkward because it seems like he was rapping it along with the music. There's nothing quite much to hype about this movie except that it stayed true to what happened to The Amazing Spider-Man comic book issue number 121. This movie could have deserved more treatment and more substance. Overall I would rate the movie 3 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A tough one to get a review from.,"This movie was incredibly difficult for me to feel a love or hate towards. The beginning was set up with maybe to much hype for the villains. On that same note though when the fight scene first started I was really into it because of the anticipation that they built. For the fight scenes two things I personally didn't enjoy. Firstly, they were incredibly short for the amount of build up they had leading into it. Secondly, the scoring was either really spot on or horribly placed and both happened within the five minute scene. The start up of the fights had this music playing with what were like whispers in Jamie Foxx's character head that was there for what seemed to be more build up but was so unneeded. The last negative piece for me was the slow motion bits. Yes the 3D value of these shots were stunning but that's why they were there, to be cool 3D moments.Anyways in all the movie was far better then the first and overall a very good Marvel superhero movie.Pros: Great use of villains. Not having them all jump in at once. Awesome cinematic work Story backing was well writtenCons: Long winded beginning Short fight scenes Over used slow motion effect Various scoring problems",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Potentially Pointless But Likable Blockbuster,"I've absolutely no idea why Hollywood feels the need to do reboots . Well maybe it might be down to money and director's vision ? Regardless of why there the narrative dead end of having to set up the characters once again . Anyone going to see a Spiderman film will know who Peter Parker is . A geek boy who leads a double life as Spiderman , a web slinging , roof top bounding crime fighter with special powers who takes on villains who use their own special powers as a force of evil . Because of my own familiarity of the backstory and premise I didn't bother wasting my time watching THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN from a couple of years ago since I'd already seen the trilogy by Sam Raimi a few years earlier so didn't want to watch a film whose runtime is going to be going over old ground and only watched this sequel because of a chance to watch a recent blockbuster for freeThere's not a lot here that can be called groundbreaking or original but for what it is - a big budget Summer blockbuster - it functions very well . I do consider Sam Raimi as being one of the most underrated directors in the last couple of decades and while Marc Webb might be an inferior director at least Webb knows how to make a marketable Summer film . I definitely found Andrew Garfield a more impressionable Peter Parker/ Spiderman than Toby MaGuire . Garfield job is made easier by having his Spiderman make wisecracks which never becomes as silly as it could have been . Garfield's smouldering good looks and his character interaction with Emma Stone's Gwen Stacey is obviously produced to rope in the TWILIGHT demographic but I thought this aspect worked fairly well . It was also nice to see Peter Parker/Spiderman have Harry Osborn / The Green Goblin as an equal of sorts . The downside is that Jamie Foxx Electro seems shoehorned in as a subsidiary villain , and at the end of the day THE AMAZING SPIDERMAN 2 is nothing more than a big budget superhero blockbuster though it's a superior and likable one",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Let The Bromance Begin!!,"I was very reluctant to watch this movie because I was disappointed with the 1st movie. But since it was the only movie showing, I decided to watch it. I did not regret my choice. The pros: The villains were really good at their portrayal. Harry not only looked like an emo teenager who whispers and sport a goth haircut, he had a real reason to save his own skin. Max Dillon was very pitiful as a villain and he seems to reflect all the teenagers who want to be seen on social media. Max is like a stalker who had a crush on his hero Peter. But when Peter scorned him, Max turned to Harry, because Harry said he needed him, and all that mushy stuff. Gwen Stacy grew a backbone and became a perfect woman who is smart AND beautiful. The movie was also very action-packed and long. Cons: Am I the only one who thinks Gwen is a hypocrite? If she want to be successful so much, why did she lead Peter on when she''s going to England? She seems very indecisive about whether she want to be with Peter or not, and her death, is purely caused by her wilfulness. She is also dressed really unrealistically like for her interview, which made this movie less realistic. Peter also looked uglier than ever, and selfish as always, because he thinks he is doing what he thinks is best for Harry. Well, what can you expect from these ""non best friends"" who didn't talk for 8 years? Overall, if you try to ignore Peter and his whole self-righteousness thing, then focus on the handsome Harry and the pitiful Max, then you will enjoy the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
TASM2 still engages and dazzles despite narrative overcrowding,"As the world's most popular superhero, Spider-Man is the poster hero for the resurgence of the superhero genre at the movies, but these days he's hanging there by a strand of webbing. When Sony gave Peter Parker a reboot in 2012's ""The Amazing Spider-Man,"" they became the first studio to recast and reimagine an entire (and lucrative) franchise, and therefore ran the first experiment to test audiences' reactions to a reboot with the original so fresh in their memory.Results have been all over the board, and they will likely continue that way for ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2."" With the Spider-Man origin story out of the way, director Marc Webb and a large team of story architects including James Vanderbilt (lone remaining writer from ""The Amazing Spider-Man""), Jeff Pinkner (TV's ""Fringe"") and the infamous blockbuster duo of Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci (""Transformers,"" ""Star Trek"") had the freedom to explore new ideas and grow the scale of the Spider-Man universe.As advertised, Spider-Man battles three baddies in this film: Electro/Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx), Harry Osborn/Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan) and Aleksei Sytsevich/Rhino (Paul Giamatti). Although the film narratively manages to avoid the villain overcrowding of the late-'90s ""Batman"" films and ""Spider-Man 3,"" it's far from ideal.As with the Lizard in the first film, these villains stem from Oscorp, which truly emerges as evil's central address in this rebooted Spider-Man universe. The opening sequence further establishes Richard Parker's connection to Oscorp, which is completely revealed in this film after being heavily teased in the first.Along with the villains and their plots and the mystery of Peter's parents, there's Peter himself and his journey as Spider-Man, his journey of discovering the truth about his parents and his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). It's probably enough material for two 90-minute films, but it's presented instead in one 142-minute film. Something does give, but surprisingly, it's not the Peter Parker stuff, or the emotion.Webb makes the cut as an action director to be sure, but his real strength is in creating character chemistry and realistic romance. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are special together on screen, which might have something to do with their off-screen chemistry, but regardless, their performances – particularly together – are the movie's greatest asset. What could have been a melodramatic roller-coaster subplot really works because Garfield shows us how torn Peter is between his instinct to love Gwen and her father's stern warning in the first film to leave her alone. Stone's Gwen is a strong young woman who acts for herself first, and so her conflicts with Peter aren't petty, but realistic.But the real testament to both Webb, the casting folks and the writers is the relationship between Peter and old friend Harry, which has just minutes to materialize in a believable manner. DeHaan and Garfield create this honest portrayal of forgotten friendship in only a few key scenes that lead to the crucial turning points of the film. Those turning points are just okay as is, so the work in these low-key scenes proves critical.Essentially, for all the good work done in character development on Peter's end, the dreadful development of the villains acts as a counter force that fortunately only weighs the final product down so much thanks to the good elements.Let's start with Electro. Foxx is cast as a one-dimensional version of his mentally ill character from ""The Soloist."" An Oscorp electrician and huge fan of Spider-Man, Max Dillon lives in his own world and suffers from an inability to separate logic from his emotions. Although the character does victims of mental illness no favors, it's plausible that Dillon could become villainous under the right circumstances. That said, the film's circumstances aren't great, particularly in the realm of why the self-proclaimed Electro would want to kill Spider-Man. Electro is a cool villain aesthetically and the special effects are terrific, but he's comparable with Arnold Schwarzenegger's Mr. Freeze.Although Harry Osborn's motivations make a bit more sense, the film rushes through his character arc. The story asks us to pity him and then despise him with little time to make the transition. DeHaan makes the most of it, however, and shows he has quite the chops for playing a villain.Plopped in all of this is Peter discovering just what his father was up to for Oscorp and why he left him as a child. What we learn makes total sense and satisfies our curiosity to know, but the information doesn't impact the film's climax in any way. Peter does nothing differently – he still must stop Electro and Green Goblin from destroying New York – and killing him.It is easy to get lost in story details and plot points and character motivation, but ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is also as entertaining as it should be, and more so than its predecessor. The camera-work and special effects are the stuff Sam Raimi probably only dreamed of and take the character (literally) to new heights. The use of slow-motion proves to not be cliché, but to actually let the audience see the quality of the effects, the attention to detail. The action also hits harder – PG-13 seems to be getting more and more graphic, which as a 20-something non-parent, doesn't bother me one iota.With the ""Sinister Six"" – a team of Spider-Man's enemies – coming down the pipeline soon, Sony needs to be a little more thoughtful about how it handles its villains, and they also should consider condensing the many themes and story lines of this new series. With just a bit more focused storytelling, their engaging, thoughtful and entertaining new ""Spider-Man"" could go from good to great, and meet fans' growing expectations of Spider-Man on the big screen.~Steve C Thanks for reading!

The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2The problem with killing a radioactive human/arachnid hybrid is it rains for, like, 6-weeks straight.Luckily the wall-crawler in this action movie is hard to squash.Concerned that his actions as Spider-Man could jeopardize Gwen (Emma Stone), Peter (Andrew Garfield) breaks things off with her.To keep his mind occupied, he bonds with Aunt May (Sally Fields) and battles with Rhino (Paul Giamatti), Electro (Jamie Foxx) and the Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan).And while fate ultimately brings Peter and Gwen back together, it also heralds Spider-Man's greatest loss.Although it's bloated on villains, this sequel is the closest to the character this franchise has come.Garfield's bogus Brooklyn accent notwithstanding, his sinewy stature and breezy banter evokes Marvel's mascot better than his predecessor.What's more, its treatment of the infamous Gwen Stacy storyline is longwinded but laudable.However, nothing is more humiliating than a super-hero walking his girlfriend's teacup Chihuahuas.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
High budget poor direction.,"I wouldn't necessarily class myself as a superhero whiz-kid, but I do know a bit about what to expect from a good film and unfortunately this was below average. Perhaps I'm being a little harsh, but if you compare a superhero franchise such as the Dark Knight to the writings of Kurtzman & Orci, you'll understand that The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is not so amazing at all. These writers had previously worked on such films as the Transformer series, so how could they forget how to write an action film within a year? The typical last second save of a persons life, is literally text book stuff. When will we see something that isn't inevitably predictable?What enraged me was the lack of originality, the poor continuity and excessive/unnecessary use of music throughout the production. I can only question whether the audio department had done their jobs correctly if they believed adding an inappropriate/unnecessary songs would mask their errors. Maybe I'm looking too far into it and in fact it was an attempt to appeal to a younger target audience. Regardless, I didn't like it.For anyone who isn't familiar with Webb's work, you should know that throughout his career, directing action/adventure movies is not a regular occurrence; which is evident within The Amazing Spider-Man 2. It just shows that anyone with a slight interest in action and a high budget can produce a run-of-the-mill action film.By employing just under 400 people within the visual effects department, Marc Webb clearly states his intentions for the movie. Its no secret that the Spider-Man films are nothing less than visually amazing, but when the plot suffers as a result of this you have to question Webb's decisions.Nevertheless, this film was entertaining and the casts performance was exceptional, in specifically Garfield (Spider-Man). I imagine the younger target audience would get out the cinema and instantly be mimicking Spider-Man's web-slinging abilities.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A pretty good film but a let down from the first,"When I saw ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"" in theaters I had high hopes that it was going to be as good as the first. It wasn't.Let's start with the positives. I liked Electro's storyline and the fight scenes between him and Spiderman were awesome. I liked the opening chase scene and the chemistry between Peter and Gwen. I also liked Peter and Aunt May's scenes. Now let's move onto the negatives of the film. And If you don't want to read any spoilers leave in 3,2,1.Now what I didn't like about the movie. I didn't like Harry Osborn becoming the Green Goblin. Norman Osborn should have been the Green Goblin in this one instead. Another thing that bothered me was the way in which they killed Gwen Stacey off. I would of liked for them to have been more faithful to the comics.I also didn't like Richard Parker's storyline as it was hyped for much of the film but there was no end reward. And I didn't like how they forgot about Uncle Ben's killer. Not cool writers. Not cool.Adding to this I would have liked to seen another movie with Gwen Stacey meeting Mary Jane. They were friends in the comics and it's a shame that they couldn't develop that into ""The Amazing Spiderman 3"". Maybe they can do that in the next Spiderman reboot.In conclusion it was a pretty good movie but it didn't live up to the last one for me.

Fun,"The Amazing Spider-man 2 is an 'amazing' film that takes place in an 'amazing' place where people stand a few yards from chaos to watch spider-man fight his enemies as if they were watching a Broadway show.

To really enjoy this movie, one has to let your inner child emerge and not to expect a superhero movie that will test your intellect.

I was so angry that the relationship between Peter and Gwen was gone for good - in my opinion it was the best thing about the film.But if you like films where death happens and you're OK with it...go see it.But for me - this film had tons of potential, then completely ruined it with a pathetic piece of story writing.

"A dumpster fire, but a fun watch","After a good looking but very boring first go round, Andrew Garfield and Co are back for The Amazing Spider-Man 2. This comes with good and bad news.

It's a terrible film that didn't get past basic concepts before being forced into filming. There are 7 or 8 stories, but 0 overall plot. There are so many characters that you only recognise them because of their actors. It's shot like a music video, with enough deleted or altered scenes to make for an entirely different film.

And the script was written by Alex Kurtsman and Robert Orci, which is an automatic fail.As of 2022, going by quality alone, this is easily the worst Spiderman film to date. But in a strange twist of fate, this was far more entertaining film than its predecessor, and even more than some of the later Tom Holland ones.Garfield, who was pretty ropy in the first one, finds hit footing here. He is a good spiderman. He comes across as a geeky, joky, friendly neighbourhood hero. Emma Stone has excellent chemistry with Garfield and makes for a good Gwen. Jamie Foxx as Electro works perfectly, despite the characters poorly written origin and motives. Everyone else is doing enough to be fine, while Paul Giamatti is hilariously over the top.When the dubstep doesn't kick in, the music makes for a good superhero theme. When the dubstep does kick in, it's hilarious. The script is so stupid it baffles belief. That means that sometimes it hits the fun camp mark, and others it is unintentionally hilarious. And others it's frustrating or even boring. The amount of sequel baiting is so much that it's clear that to Sony this was less a movie and more an advert for a whole film universe.In the end, if you are going to make a bad film, make it this bad. As terrible as it is, it is one of the only live action, not Sam Raimi made spiderman films I will watch more than once. It has too many boring moments to be a guilty pleasure. But it is an entertaining outing for Spiderman, in both the right and wrong ways.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing Spider-Man 2 Review,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is the latest Spider-Man film by Mark Webb. The film stars: Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, and Dane DeHann. The movie starts out great, showing how Peter (Garfield) has gotten used to being 'Spider-Man'. He's protecting New York's citizens, putting it's bad guys behind bars, and being the friendly neighborhood hero we all know and love. He is also in the midst of a complicated relationship between him and Gwen Stacy (Stone) involving Peter's hesitance to involve Gwen in his dangerous job as Spider-Man. And before long we meet the films antagonists, Electro (Foxx) and Harry Osborn (DeHann).Coming out of The Amazing Spider-man 2, I'm weighing out the good and the bad. This movie has its fair share of both. For example, the movie has some great action sequences, making use of stunning visual effects in the process. But these scenes are too short and too few for a 140-minute movie. This, in turn, makes the movie feel sluggish and slow to the point. Fortunately performances by Garfield and DeHann pick up the slack. There is a major improvement in Garfield's acting since the first of the films and DeHann plays a compelling Harry Osborn, even if his darker side as Green Goblin doesn't get as much screen time as Foxx. Which brings me to another downside, Electro. Electro's role in the movie is questionable, as he hardly gets any screen time himself, and doesn't measure up to his evil accomplice, Green Goblin.As a whole, Amazing Spider-Man 2 has some good acting in it, looks great visually, and is good enough to make an entertaining addition to the Spider-Man franchise.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Look up in the sky,"Peter Parker is back as he is on top of the world with his love and finally graduating from High School. Unfortunately this crime fighter cannot stay away from saving lives and continues his double life as Spiderman. This movie has a slow build up as it develops the complex relationship with is love Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and builds up the development of Electro (Jamie Foxx). Peter Parkers long lost friend appears and becomes a rival in the Green Goblin and layers of other drawn out story lines are painted. If you are a spider man fan, it might be right for you. If you are not, it might be a movie you see in bits because it gets very long winded at times but will hopefully make you appreciate these creepy crawlers the next time you see one.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Lot of stories in this one than its previous installment.,"Felt this was much better than first movie. Lot of stories in this one. Many parts are rather boring though. And watching the same spiderman in original storyline and after few years from Sam Raimi's version with twisted storyline is pretty lame to watch. If this was a series released after a decade or so, then it would have better. And story in Sam Raimi's version, though twisted and not close to original comic book storyline, was very much likable.Personally did not like acting skills of Garfield. Don't think he has done well in scenes he as to engage with Emma Stone. Other scene were quite OK.Wonder who is gonna be Mary Jane Watson would be in next installment? Online rumours hint on ""Shailene Woodley"" who was protagonist in the Divergent.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Already better than the originals,"Being a Spider-Man fan I was very much looking forward to watching this movie. After seeing how much better the first one was than the originals... I couldn't wait to see this one. Well, it was definitely worth the $15 dollars (the additional 4 dollars because of it being in 3-D) I enjoyed every second of it. If you are familiar with the comic books you unfortunately are going to know what happens. But it adds to the story and the ending makes you wonder about the future. Dane DeHaan played a Fabulous portrayal of the Green Goblin... Better than William Dafoe? I don't know, it's a possibility. You be the judge. Paul Giamatti played a good criminal/Rhino when he had the chance to be on screen (which was rarely). And Jamie Foxx did a tremendous job as usual playing as the loner Max a.k.a Electro a.k.a bad ass super-villain. This movie makes you think big time about the future of Spider-Man and also... Who his future opponents are going to be. I extremely recommend watching this in 3-D.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Very good Spidey-Movie! Andrew Garfield IS Spider-Man!,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was a very fun film but also a very flawed one. On the one hand its a very fun action film with some great performances and great special effect. On the other hand the plot feels like it wants to be so many things that it felt jumbled and lacked focus. The villains were exciting and cool but also felt underwhelming in the ending result. Electro lacked resolution and Harry Osbourne just seemed pushed. Also, what was the point of Rhino? I understand they are trying to setup the Six storyline, but they need to keep the story in one place. Andrew Garfield is the best Spider-Man to ever grace the big screen, sorry Tobey Maguire. Emma Stone, Jamie Foxx, Dane DeHann, and the rest are all fantastic as well. The action was beautifully done and Peter Parker's character had some very good development and his wise cracking humor made the film highly enjoyable. Overall while it doesn't tread any new ground we still receive a sequel that lives up to its fun predecessor and proves to be more than worth the price of admission.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Okay, so so!","I don't give this a bad grade mainly because of the acting at the end (plus throughout the film by Dane Dehaan who is very talented), the Spider-man suit and action, and some elements of the story. This might be controversial but I liked this better than the first Amazing Spider-Man! Nothing beats the Raimi films though, but I'd be open to seeing an Amazing Spider-Man 3 and seeing more from Andrew Garfield, not because of this movie but mainly because of his character in No Way Home.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Bad villain,The villain like harry osborn is really forced to be in the movie. Electro development isnt that bad tho. And gwen with andrew chemistry is the best out of all 3 spiderman. The plot us really messy also.,8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Worst super hero movie,"From the first scenes of the movie to the end screen all the movie is full of stupid forced situations that try to make sense but fail miserably. There is no development in the process to create for the super villains, no way for the people to understand their motivations to be evil, they are just crazy foes. Yes, they seem to follow the comics plot, but a movie is a different medium than a comic book, you can't throw all the possible stuff that happens in the books in several years in just a couple of hours. It's a complete chaos. I think both the direction and the script are just awful. The actors just play fine with the text lines are told to say, but still they look like schizophrenic bipolar people, unaware of the context where they are.",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Surprisingly bombastic but entertaining, Spider-Man excels in characterisations and spectacle but suffers from a muddled script.","The Amazing Spider-Man was a hard buy. It's aesthetics didn't match Sam Raimi's trilogy, despite how bombastic the third one was, but Andrew Garfield was a better Spider-Man, not a better Peter Parker. It was a favourable average film that had a lot of room for improvement but since they announced the second film, I was instantly excited. I was expecting the sequel to have major improvements over the first and my expectations were correct. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 has lots of improvements to admire. Director Marc Webb's sequel is bold and bright and possesses charm in abundance. It swings into the future and carries the audience with it. Entertainment is important and this film has it. One thing in the film is noticeable, however, it suffers from a clumsy script.Events begin not long after the end of the first film. Peter Parker is still haunted by the death of Gwen's father and the promise he failed to keep (to protect his daughter by leaving her alone). But in some ways he's moved on, graduating high school, enjoying life and really embracing the role of being New York's protector. Unlike so many superheroes, the identity of Spider-Man doesn't seem to be a burden but a release for Peter – he's confident and cocky with his now-honed abilities. Director Marc Webb presents this brilliantly. The audience are instantly hooked into Peter's life and his responsibilities and this is because of engaging screenplay and playful cinematography, expertly executed. The beginning of the film shows Spider-Man battling on-the-run criminals as part of his responsibility and this gets in the way of Peter and Gwen's relationship. During this chase, Peter saves a man from a car crash named Max Dillon (played by Jamie Foxx) who works for Oscorp, led by Harry Osborn, Peter's childhood friend. The film tries to introduce Max Dillon as a character for whom we should feel sympathy – he's socially awkward, lonely, unappreciated, and since Spider-Man saved his life, he's become obsessed with the hero. Max, shortly after a major accident at Oscorp, discovers that he has powerful electric powers and soon becomes Electro, the main antagonist of the film. This is well told through the detailed, enjoyable but increasingly clumsy script. One thing that confuses me about the film is that the first instalment was supposed to be ""the untold story of Peter Parker"". This film actually shares more untold elements than the first, such as finding out what happened to Peter's parents. Peter's parents are a big part of The Amazing Spider-Man 2's plot, without going into much detail. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 benefits from a lot of good qualities, such as a brilliant chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, a great Spider-Man, satisfying and exhilarating action and well presented villains but also negatively benefits from minor issues. It's childish but emotional script penned by Alex Kurtsman & Roberto Orci lets the film down and frankly, it may be a biased opinion, their work on Transformers was TERRIBLE. There's a lot going on in Amazing Spider-Man 2, and sadly it doesn't always come together because of it's writers.Action, as you expect from a Marvel film, is very good indeed. Spider-Man's abilities are shown perfectly without any flaw in the picture. Music is quite unique and heroic, brought together by Hans Zimmer, The Magnificent Six, Pharrell Williams & Johnny Marr. It certainly sounds good, with high-quality instruments and themes but some material sounds like it came from another movie. The acting is very good as well. Andrew Garfield is a FANTASTIC Spider-Man and is certainly better at his role than the previous instalment. The film positively benefits from a great cast in overall and there is nothing to judge, especially Dane DeHann as he steals the show as Harry Osborn / Green Goblin.Pros & Cons:+ Great chemistry with Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and director Marc Webb.+ Very entertaining presentation and opening. Perfectly judged slingshot ending.+ Great Spider-Man action and great villains.+ Improves the strengths of the first film entirely such as action and presentation.+ Unique and powerful soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, The Magnificent Six, Pharrell Williams and Johnny Marr.Disappointing script and muddled story dominates the film's positive reception.Not enough action from a Spider-Man film like the first.Verdict: 7.7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Spectacular Web of Emotion and Action!,"*Review by: FriendlyNeighborhoodSpidey99* 😂What can I say about ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" except that it's an electrifying rollercoaster of emotions, action, and heart-stopping moments that had my spider-sense tingling from start to finish! Director Marc Webb has once again swung us into the world of our favorite web-slinger, and this time, he's facing challenges that will truly test not only his spidey-powers but also his heart.From the moment the film kicks off, you're immediately immersed in Peter Parker's world - the duality of his life as the iconic Spider-Man and his struggles as a young man grappling with love, loss, and the responsibility that comes with his extraordinary abilities. Andrew Garfield's portrayal of Peter Parker is nothing short of spectacular - he captures the wit, the charm, and the underlying vulnerability that make Spider-Man such a relatable and beloved character.The chemistry between Garfield's Spider-Man and Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy is palpable and heartwarming. Their relationship is at the forefront of the film, and the dynamic between them is so genuine that you can't help but root for their love to conquer all. Emma Stone brings a depth and strength to Gwen Stacy that transcends the typical damsel-in-distress trope, making her a force to be reckoned with in her own right.And let's talk about the villains! Jamie Foxx as Electro is positively electrifying (pun intended). The transformation of Max Dillon from an overlooked, unappreciated electrical engineer to the formidable, power-hungry Electro is mesmerizing to watch. His dazzling special effects and intense battles with Spidey bring a whole new level of visual excitement to the film.But that's not all - we're also introduced to Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn, Peter's childhood friend, and a complex character who grapples with his own demons. DeHaan's portrayal of the conflicted and tragic Harry is a standout, bringing a new layer of depth to the Spider-Man universe.And of course, who could forget the adrenaline-pumping action sequences? The web-swinging scenes are breathtaking, capturing the exhilarating feeling of soaring through the city skyscrapers. The showdowns between Spidey and his adversaries are intense and masterfully choreographed, keeping you on the edge of your seat.""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" isn't just a superhero movie - it's a tale of love, loss, friendship, and the choices we make that define us. It's a reminder that even the most powerful heroes have their vulnerabilities, their doubts, and their internal struggles. As Spidey faces down powerful foes and personal challenges, you'll find yourself laughing, crying, and cheering him on every step of the way.In a cinematic landscape filled with superhero movies, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" stands out as a triumph of storytelling, character development, and sheer entertainment. So, grab your popcorn, settle in, and prepare to be swept away on a web-slinging adventure that will leave you exhilarated and wanting more. Because, as Spidey himself would say, ""With great power comes great responsibility,"" and this movie takes that responsibility to heart.**Rating: 10/10 - A Spectacular Must-Watch!**",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
THE Amazing...,"After so much controversy and criticism pertaining to this particular film, I decided to give it a rewatch and I can definitely reassure Spider-Man fans that, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 isn't awful, but flawed...To avoid any spoilers, I will just state the biggest argument of this film, which is that: ""It had a lot going on"". The reason for that though was due to Sony's plans to set up a Live Action Spider-Man Universe. So The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was the one film of the series that essentially had to get sacrificed with too much being in it in order to kickstart their future film plans, which was: Sinister Six, The Amazing Spider-Man 3, Venom, etc.PS: I really recommend that before you watch this movie, that you also watch videos critically reviewing it, because after the movie is completed, you'll be shocked as to how far off most of those reviews are. A lot of them nitpick every aspect of the movie that rubbed particularly them the wrong way... You really begin to appreciate the Marc Webb, Andrew Garfield films much more compared to the current team.",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Awesome movie... kinda slow in the middle,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was one of the movies this summer that I have been looking forward to for a while. Every teaser and trailer leading up to the film got me more and more excited. Heading into the theater I was so hyped up for the film... But I guess my expectations got too high for this Spidey sequel.The cast in this movie was excellent, Andrew Garfield embodies everything I remember from the Spider-Man growing up. He's smart, funny and kind of cocky. Emma Stone put on a solid performance as well, she and Garfield definitely have great chemistry on screen. Newcomer Dane DeHaan was a great choice for Harry Osborn/Goblin. I was pumped when they announced him for the character, mainly because of Chronicle. I was surprised how much Dennis Leary was in this movie though, I thought he was great in the first movie. Jaime Foxx was another person who did a phenomenal job in this movie, his transformation from a bumbling nobody to a villain to be reckoned with was impressive. Finally Paul Giamatti is a very talented actor and I felt as if he was underused in this sequel. He had a heavy accent and had barely any screen time, but his scenes were some of the best in the movie.The movie starts off in the past with Peter's parents and how why they had to leave him as a child. I was surprised how badass his parents were for a couple of revolutionary scientists. After his parents' demise, the film jumps right into Peter doing his thing around the city as everybody's favorite hero. As he jumps, flips, and swings through the city after some criminals, he showcases his cockyness. A lot of physical humor as he's using his superior reflexes and agility to save the day and narrowly making his high school graduation at the same time. Then this is where the movie slows down a little, Peter has to deal with the promise he made to Dennis Leary at the end of the last movie to stay away from his daughter, Gwen Stacy. This throws a lot of guilt on his shoulders because he is blatantly disregarding the promise he made. Gwen and Peter go back and forth with this ""we can't be together"" for a chunk of the movie. This is where Harry comes into play and Peter starts to uncover more about his parents actually reasons for leaving. The movie kind of drags until Max Dillon has the typical pre-villain accident that turns him into Electro. Spider-Man's first battle with Electro in Times Square is awesome. That action was entertaining and unique, the CGI in this movie was well done, especially the slow motion and 3-D. I love when movies nail the use of 3-D and this sequel did, just as the previous movie did. Then Harry takes over Oscorp and digs up all of the company's technology and projects, basically to give him everything he needs to become the goblin. I really enjoyed when Harry teamed up with Electro and wreaked havoc on the city. The movie culminates into a battle at the electric grid where Spider-Man takes out Electro then battles Green Goblin back to back. Peter goes toe to toe with Harry and Gwen gets caught in the mix. As she is falling to her peril Peter shoots his web down after her, only to maneuver through ridiculous odds to only reach her a split second too late. He catches her but she smacks the floor just enough to end her life. This takes its toll on Peter as he gives up his webs and tights for a normal life. Only for it to be five months later and the mysterious man in the shadows from the end of the first one, unleashes Rhino onto the city. The movie ends with the clip played in every trailer of him swinging the man hole cover at Rhino.I would give this movie a 7/10 because it had a great cast and great action, but it just had a big lull in the middle that didn't really do it for me. Yeah I get it, Gwen's gonna die so let's make sure she gets her screen time before then to make it more meaningful, but I'd rather have seen Spider-Man handle business in the streets. On a side note, I am most definitely excited for the Sinister Six movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not better than first part,"I skipped The Amazing Spider-man franchise due to so much negative reviews from fans but then decided to give it a try. Actually, I liked this franchise. It was fun to watch but it looked like movie hasn't move out of first part. Showing us Peter parents fate and romance scenes more than villains scene was a bad idea. When a sequel is made, it is made using new ideas but it looked like director used maximum elements of first part due to which you can't feel fresh while watching second part.Overall, it was fun to watch but not better than part first part.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Amazing Spiderman II Music,"A modern film score is a mechanical puzzle. The Amazing Spiderman II music team exercises an eclectic mix of talent with modern music production and styles and orchestral themes. While the pieces are each awesome, the selections loose consistency to one another. Maybe that's the point because the story is brilliant and as the characters experience victory and defeat, so does the music.The opening piece is fantastic where the modern meets the ""trad"" world and both work together resulting in artistry on the output channel. Then here come the trendy club sounds, glitches and other effects that over saturate the current market for video gamers and midnight dancers.A beautiful sound design could have joined these styles together, but this is what is missing in this film as the score simply goes from one piece to the next. Maybe that's what the director wanted but it misses the consistency mark in sound design. Still awesome though.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Getting down,"The movie starts off interestingly enough and Andrew Garfield almost falls into the Sam Raimi trap (Spiderman 3) where Tobey Maguire had a sequence where he ""tried"" to be cool. Garfield though does kind of pull that off, even though it's very frenetic and does make little sense (other than to be revisited towards the end). Still Andrews Peter Parker is lovable (mostly).There is a sense of overload though and especially the character portrayed by Jamie Foxx is not playing well into all of this. It's a shame, because Foxx has proved that he can be part of a big movie (see Django Unchained), but he's not working here. The motives are clear in the big picture, but the way they do get ""unleashed"" is not realized in the best way possible.Having said all that, the special effects are really good and if you let yourself into it, the movie will take you onto a ride. With a few surprises along the way ... well at least one for me!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Would Have Been So Much Better Without Jamie Foxx,"Good but not great sequel that manages to improve upon some things but, like the first movie, still has quite a few bugs. First, the good. Peter is far more likable in this movie. He's fun, he cracks more jokes, and seems more in line with the way Spider-Man should be portrayed. The cast is mostly solid. Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone, and Sally Field all return from the first movie and shine. Dane DeHaan is very good as Harry Osborn, although the movie would have been better served with just him as the villain and giving him more screen time to build up his relationship with Peter. The action is much improved over the first movie, with some very impressive sequences that stand out. I can't recall a notable action scene from the first movie. I also loved the ending to this one. It was perfect.Now, the bad. Let's start with friggin' Electro, played by Jamie Foxx. Ugh what kind of crap is this? I wonder if this is yet another case of the studio forcing them to add another villain to the movie, afraid audiences would be bored otherwise. Foxx's performance is embarrassingly bad. He seems like he would be more at home in a Joel Schumacher Batman movie. They also give him goofy music in the first part of the film like Otis from Superman (78). Terrible. I hated the look of the character, as well. All too often Hollywood's crappy designers think they can improve upon costumes and appearances of characters from comic books that have lasted for decades. Well, they're wrong 99% of the time and here Electro is yet another example of that. Not to mention Rhino, but I'll let that slide. The video game climax was a bit much, with the CGI Spider-Man looking so cartoony I thought the movie had turned into an animated film for awhile. Lastly, something I didn't like from this or the first movie is the stupid plot involving Peter's parents. I don't think it was necessary and ultimately added very little to either movie.I still recommend the movie because parts of it are excellent and overall the movie works, despite the problems with Foxx and some of the other issues. It strikes a nice balance between light and dark, even better than the first movie did. I just wish they wouldn't keep thinking that superhero sequels had to have multiple villains, especially cheesy ones.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What are these people thinking?,"Okay, first I am a huge fan of the original comic books, However, I don't mind writers and directors messing with the characters mythology or story arch to make things flow better, to modernize the story or just in the interest of improved story telling for a different medium. That said, I really don't care for the way the writers, director and editor of this series have cherry picked certain plot elements to change and others to leave intact. Also, I am very appreciative of the excellent acting skills and chemistry the principals bring to the table so I feel like there is a lot of potential wasted here.The two things that really bother me are the pacing and the way the story telling talks down to the audience. First of all, this movie, as well as the first one, in the series, suffer from very long exposition up front and then break into the action later in the film, which is not always explained as well. In this case it causes serious problems in that there are several major story elements late in the film that are not explained and the audience is just supposed to go along with, without sufficient explanation. Also, they just pull some crap out of their posteriors late in the film that makes no real sense and feels like they really have no respect for their audience. Anyway, I have wasted enough time on this turkey already. I will re-watch the Sam Raimi versions over the weekend to clear out the bad taste.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Made for the fans,"Alright this might be biased but I really love this movie. I know its the universally disliked one and probably the lowest rated of any Spider-Man movie but I just love it.Not saying it is without flaw because there sure are a lot of them really. First of all I'm not a fan of the casting of the villains, it just doesn't work for me at all. Which is weird because these were all comic accurate, certainly more accurate than the Sam Raimi villains but the casting doesn't work for me. I guess I might be too attached to the James Franco Harry. DeHaan as Goblin/Hary was the weakest part of the film for me, so much so that had it been completely removed I would've loved it even more and rated it much higher too. It was poorly acted and didn't transition well on the big screen. Jamie Foxx as Electro was certainly more bearable but nothing to write home about. The script is still a letdown and it is messy at times even tho plot progression is not too bad.That is where the negatives end for me and as you guessed it the positives far outshine the negatives. This movie has my favorite score in a Spider-Man movie so far. That Electro theme and the battle music is hands down my favorite piece of audio in any Spider-Man property. The whole movie feels like a videogame and that is a good thing here. It does come off understandably cheesy but it really helps with making Spider-Man be at his best. The powerplant synthesizer battle is also something that tickles the nerd bone. It is an inferior movie in almost every aspect but it is a very good Spider-Man movie. It encapsulates everything we associate with Spider-Man.The fight scenes were as good as ever altho messy at times. But what makes this movie stand up is the amount of iconic moments, something the first movie seriously lacked. One of the most iconic event in Spider-Man canon with excellent gut punch and visceral acting that is often not seen in superhero movies. Excellent chemistry between Andrew and Emma is still the cornerstone of the Marc Webb series. It is also the most comic accurate Spider-Man movie so far even tho it didn't do the movie any favor.Its honestly everything Peter Parker is, all complex emotions presented in movie runtime. This movie gets Spider-Man absolutely right, it understands the character. The opening and closing scene are the perfect representation of Spider-Man as a character. If the last movie was for the comic fans this one is for the videogame fans for sure. I'm a fan of both so worked great for me. There are several moments that I wish were cut from the movie and characters axed altogether, then comes scene where my face glows up because I can see the directors understanding and love for the character. Fan of Tobey Maguire Spider-Man are going to have a hard time with it no doubt but if you're a fan of Spider-Man in all forms and media then you're going to love this despite its glaring issuesRATING: 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Scrambled Spidey Mess with Batman & Robin horror flashbacks,"You know when you have great ingredients to cook a great meal but somehow manage to mess up your dish entirely? Well here we have great actors, great writers, incredibly talented C.G.I artists, an enormous budget and best of all one of the most iconic Marvel super hero of all time and yet somehow they managed to make an unstructured and unbalanced mess out of this movie.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 goes from comedy to intense drama to high speed super hero slow motion action scenes. It takes you on a mood swing trip as if you were a monkey on speed. At first you think: ""Hell yes! Spider-Man! I am in for a ride! Bring it on!"" But suddenly you realize that this movie is completely out of balance. The tone of the whole movie leaves you in a state of confusion. It doesn't seem to be a streamlined movie at all. Where does it go? Do we laugh now? Do we cry now? What is all this nonsense? Of course they have promoted this movie through the roof with showing off trailers and video clips of high tech 2014 ready C.G.I action scenes. It's safe to say that TASM2 looks stunning with crazy super slow motion micro detailed comic book flavored scenes. But at some point it was as if the different C.G.I scenes had to compete against each other to stand out, and therefore they became somewhat of a distraction of the whole flow of the movie. This is also the problem with basically all other scenes. The drama isn't bad, the acting isn't bad, it's good in fact. But they don't build up to it, they just magically appear. We suddenly get pulled out because of yet another deeply romantic love scene or yet another highly dramatic plot twist and I ask myself so many times during this movie: This doesn't make sense at all, and why am I seeing this now at this precise moment, please just carry on with the story! Didn't Marc Webb ever heard of the principle: ""Less Is More?"". It's more like ""more is bigger and better equals more drama, more comedy and let's trow in another bad guy!"" with this flick.In all seriousness, it really felt as if there were too many people involved in making decisions in this movie. I imagine Marc Webb trying to do his own thing in his little working room and suddenly some big corporate Sony guy comes in and says: NO WE NEED MORE ACTION AND MORE SUPER BAD GUYS..! And... errr... EXPLOSIONS!!! And there, we have Marc Webb all teary eyed wanting to just make a 500 Days Of Summer Spider-Man remix. Well Marc, you can't just do your emotional thing and trying to mix and match this with big budget superhero movies. If there is one company that has it down (and I passionately share the opinion of many other true believers) it's Marvel. So Marc or Sony, if you guys are reading this, you have told your origin story of Spider-Man (again), but now is the time to give back the torch to Marvel so we can continue to see Spider-Man in a much greater light.So my score is 4 out of 10: 3 points for great actors (1 for Garfield, 1 for Dehaan and 1 for that subway pigeon that took a giant dump on Emma Stone's head) and 1 point for that Asian guy who made the realistic Spidey fart effect during the swinging scene in daylight NY.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fear being caught in a web of boredom.,"Aunt May (Sally Field): ""I once told you that secrets have a cost. The truth does too.""The truth in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is it might cost you over $10 to be bored for 142 minutes. Spidey/Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is fighting the romantic demons once again while powerful enemies are reduced to the status of playground bullies by comparison to the film's minutes. The reboot has moments of humor (Peter Parker: You want me to come down there so you can kill me? Aleksei Sytsevich: Yeah! Peter Parker: OK, I'll be right there.) but just too few. In fact, I may not review another super-hero film this summer just to avoid wasting more hours on these clichéd adventure-fantasies.Marc Webb goes nose to nose with Sam Raimi's earlier trilogy and comes off second place (notwithstanding Raimi's soporific 2007 Spider-Man 3). Although Peter's on again-off again love of Gwen (Emma Stone) is as repetitious as the rest of the film, the moment he allows her to contribute her intelligence to the downfall of Max Dillon/Electro (Jamie Foxx), the film becomes charged with honest characterization—she is after all going to Oxford—whereby the old stereotype of the helpless maiden is short-circuited for a moment, but only a moment. Most of the other time she is in need of rescue or trying to break up their relationship, both motifs overwrought and tedious.By the way, Electro is a promising villain, pumped up with energy that can debilitate a city and a character from humble roots, who could have provided fascinating complexity but who ends up just getting too charged up. The special effects for Electro brimming with volts and Spidey spinning through Gotham are as to be expected, state of the art.But a good story is more than CGI—it should engage the minds of bright people gone bad, such as the heir to Oscorp, Harry (Dane DeHaan), who is the new head of the sinister corporation Peter's father worked for in genetic engineering gone wrong and where Max picked up his energy.Harry has his moments, but like Electro, he can't trump the time director Mark Webb and his writers give to the simple-minded star- crossed romance. Webb is far away from the lovely little story of troubled romance he directed in (500) Days of Summer. Maybe when DeHaan fleshes out the Green Goblin, and maybe Gwen returns, then I will be renewed, overcharged as this iteration is with mediocre romance.Peter Parker: There really is no place like home.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
What Superhero Movies Need,"I went to the cinema with doubts about this movie. After seeing about 20 trailers I though I had seen most of the movie ( plus the clips we saw were, to be honest, not the best ) but boy, I was wrong. With great action scenes, engaging characters and an entertaining plot this has to be the best Spiderman movie Sony have made.The story focuses on Peter's personal life throughout most of the movie as he tries to keep a normal life with Gwen and figure out what happened to his parents. The main villain is Electro which is brilliantly acted by Jamie Foxx but unfortunately doesn't get enough screen time. The second villain is the Green Goblin, acted by Dane DeHaan who was not ( in my opinion ) the best choice of casting because he seems depressed most of the time and makes the character rather boring.This film feels like you are watching a comic book rather than a movie, as it isn't all fight scenes and sadness because we see Spiderman save people rather than focus on the villain and destroy everything possible. Talking about destruction, the visual effects look amazing but seem a bit like a cartoon which is rather good to keep the feeling of a comic book.Overall this film is entertaining but doesn't live up to the name amazing. I would recommend anyone to watch it as it is something new and basically a new genre of movie, a comic book movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Not as bad as some would have you believe, but still an absolute mess.","'The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)' is not as bad as some would have you believe, in fact I'd even say it's better than the first 'Amazing Spider-Man' movie. It's still an under-cooked and over-produced mess, though, one that is most certainly the result of too many cooks (and super-villains) in the kitchen. There are scenes that provide passing entertainment - for example, the spider-swinging sequences are fantastically realised with honestly some of the best visual effects I've seen - but the feature then gets bogged down in exposition and stupidity as a corporate espionage plot comes into play and then promptly fizzles away, leaving us with nothing but the empty promise of sequels which, after this film failed so spectacularly, will now never see the light of day. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not so fast,"""Hey look, it's Spider-Man!"" The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a film directed by Marc Webb that came out in 2014. A sequel to the already first outstanding film, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 stars Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker also known as Spider-Man. With his special spider abilities Peter uses his powers to save New York from lunatic supervillains. However, even being one of the greatest superheroes in New York doesn't mean that Anthony Lane from The New Yorker will praise your movie. Anthony states, ""Despite the efforts of Electro, the franchise is running shockingly low on juice."" Something that is completely false as there is so much to cover in this film.Starting from the opening scene we get jam packed action. We start off with finally getting a bit of backstory of what happens with Peter's parents. Unlike the original Spider-Man where we're just prompted with Peter living with Aunt May and Uncle Ben and his actual parents are nowhere to be found or even mentioned at all. Though the scene runs a bit short, it is still nice being able to know why they're gone and not a part of Peter's life.Then we get Jamie Foxx into the mix. He plays the role of the main villain ""Electro"" or Max Dillion, a nerdy engineer who works at OSCORP. Electro goes on terrorizing New York City to get revenge on all those who have ever put him down. Foxx's role made this character 10 times better with his passion into making Max truly seem like an outcast. Though he is a villain we can still feel empathy towards him by the way Foxx shows the character's emotion. Just because Foxx is a bit older doesn't mean that he can't portray a great marvel villain. He instead uses his acting experience to improve on the character.Furthermore, Dane DeHaan's interpretation of Harry Osborn made the movie even better. The way that Harry and Electro both ended up becoming friends made the movie 10 times better through them being able to share similar experiences of betrayal. I feel that the partnership between Foxx and DeHaan was incredible and since they both have hatred towards Spider-Man they decide to take him on making them seem like a great villain partnership.Who doesn't like seeing a web slinging spider? If you're a Spider-Man fan then seeing him back in action is always a thriller, seeing all the stunts and acrobatics combined with CGI really should amaze you. The effects and CGI are incredible. I personally loved Max's transformation into Electro the most. You could tell the editor really took time into making his character. Even with the small details such as the sparks from his fingers to static electricity coursing through his body. His ability to teleport anywhere with electrical currents is astonishing.If you love a film with good cinematography this is the one. Starting from the main hero, the new suit gave Spider-Man a new futuristic look. I really enjoyed even the tiniest detail such as the meter on the side of Electro's head to indicate when he would be overcharging. By making and adding those small details it really can enhance the audience's experience when watching the film.Although some critics like David Sims from The Atlantic said that this film seems to be ""over-stuffed with plot and consequently struggles to invest the audience in any of it,"" I believe that the constant switch between scenes captures your attention even more. Instead of having scenes that bore the audience the director decides to intrigue the audience by having point of view switched from the main hero to the supervillain. By adding the point of view of Electro it helps you understand the character's motive to hate on people further than just by the fact of knowing that he was being bullied. This especially helps if you don't know much about the characters from reading the original marvel comics by giving you a bit more of their background story.For this film to receive 52% rotten tomatoes is a disgrace. This movie is set to entertain people and engage those who like seeing their childhood cartoon characters on film. This film should be enjoyable and meant to make people laugh a little with Spider-Man's jokes. I would certainly recommend this movie to anyone that isn't a comic book marvel fan but still enjoys watching the marvel movies and tv shows. It's always a pleasure to watch the friendly neighborhood Spider-Man on the big screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Amazing Spider-Man 2: A Web of Intrigue and Action,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 weaves a captivating tale set in the bustling metropolis of New York City. Picking up after the events of its predecessor, the film follows Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as he navigates the dual responsibilities of being both a beloved hero and a normal teenager.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in the chemistry between Garfield and Emma Stone as Peter and Gwen Stacy. Their on-screen relationship is both heartwarming and heartbreaking, as they grapple with the challenges of love, loss, and the dangers of Peter's superhero life. The actors deliver nuanced performances that make their characters feel real and relatable.The film's villain, Electro (Jamie Foxx), is a compelling antagonist driven by a thirst for revenge and a desire for power. His transformation from a timid electrical engineer to a menacing supervillain is visually striking and emotionally resonant. Foxx delivers a powerful performance, capturing Electro's internal turmoil and his growing obsession with destruction.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 boasts impressive action sequences that are both thrilling and visually stunning. The climactic battle between Spider-Man and Electro is a highlight, showcasing the film's special effects and innovative choreography. The filmmakers skillfully balance these action-packed moments with quieter, more intimate scenes, allowing the characters to develop and the story to unfold at a natural pace.The film's soundtrack, composed by Hans Zimmer, adds to the overall atmosphere and elevates the emotional impact of certain scenes. Zimmer's score is both epic and haunting, perfectly complementing the film's action-packed moments and heartfelt character interactions.While The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a thrilling and entertaining film, it is not without its flaws. Some viewers may find the plot somewhat convoluted and the pacing uneven in certain parts. Additionally, the film's exploration of certain themes, such as corporate greed and the consequences of unchecked power, could have been delved into more deeply.Despite these minor shortcomings, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is a worthy addition to the Spider-Man franchise. Its strong performances, visually stunning action sequences, and compelling characters make it a must-watch for fans of superhero films and those seeking a thrilling cinematic experience.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
General popcorn viewing,"Maybe I'm old, but I didn't enjoy Spiderman 2 as much as I wanted to. Don't get me wrong I didn't hate it, nor did I regret watching it. I just felt that there was an element of 'seen it all before' in there.I'm not going to go into the plot of a Spiderman film. If you can't guess that our web-slinging superhero star comes up against another baddie then you really need to watch more movies! I wasn't expecting some deep and revolutionary film, filled with perfect character arcs and plot twists, but I did think it would be a little more original than it was.It seemed to want to cater for the 'tween' generation, pushing Peter Parker and Gwen Stacey's relationship to the forefront of the film, as if it was nothing more than a 'teen drama.' Yes, there's the 'fantasy' element to the story of how being a superhero interferes with your 'normal' teenage romance, but when Peter and Gwen are doing their 'make-up/break-up' routine, it comes across as a 'Twilight' movie with more cobwebs.The fact is that a Spiderman movie is at its best when we see Spiderman. Andrew Garfield is much better (and much more interesting) as the superhero than when he's wandering up and down the halls of his school moaning about Gwen. The film-makers really should have learnt from 'Iron Man 3' about how the public feels about superhero movies where the hero doesn't spend enough time 'in costume.' However, when the action starts it gets going. You may have seen the advertising promoting 'three' villains. Well, that is technically true, but the only one you'll really get to know properly is Jamie Fox's 'Electro.' He's the main threat to Spiderman (and the best). And when he starts kicking off then our web-slinging friend is in trouble. Everything is better when things explode. Jamie Fox plays the tragic villain with sympathy at first, before slipping into full-blown menace. The 'Green Goblin' is also in it, but he's secondary at this stage to Electro. And don't even bother mentioning 'Rhino' – he's barely got more than a cameo in the film.It's a long film, stretching over two hours and, although the action is exciting and when it's good it's good, there was still what felt like a lot of 'filler' in there that could have been trimmed out to make it a little less irrelevant.Probably loved by kids and enjoyed by me on only some of the levels it was meant for.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Golden opportunity gone wasted. This Sequel could have been better.,"When the Spider man series was re-booted in 2012, I was wondering - Will it survive ? Does it even require a reboot since last Spider man film released 5 years back only. Why do not they just continue with the same star cast and take it forward. I guess I was right !!!The Amazing Spiderman 2 continues the story of Peter Parkar and his battle petite against highly lethal enemies like Electro and The Green Goblin incepted out of the Oscorp company and the truth behind his father's sudden disappearance.I was slightly disappointed with The Amazing Spiderman as it was dark and shady on contrary to the comical version of Sam Raimi's. Fortunately, I was pumped up to see the sequel thanks to extraordinary and catchy trailer. The movie begins with Spider man fighting the goons with satirical humor embedded which was passable. As the movie progresses, the director loses the focus of the story and includes the romantic track which hinders the movement. The film picks up the steam as we watch the epic battle between ELECTRO and SPIDERMAN which was well executed with eye-catching CGI. The editing is really weak and the screenplay is a roller coaster ride. Though the 1st half is plain, second half gathers some momentum especially the climax fight scene which was well-executed and something to look out for. Cinematography is splendid with superb art direction. Dialogues are fine. Though the story is pretty weak, it is CGI which is highly driven and mesmerizing. Andrew Garfield does fine as Peter Parkar but still I would love to see Tobey Maguire reprising the role which made him famous. Emma Stone was not in form. Jamie Foxx and Dane DeHaan were good in their respective roles.Overall, The Amazing Spiderman 2 could have better.

Harry Osborne was the Hobgoblin,"I am sick and tired of movies getting things wrong from the original comic book characters. Harry Osborne was never the Green Goblin he was the Hobgoblin, get your characters straight. Also Electro was never dropped into a tank of electric eels he was electrocuted by climbing a electric tower during a power outage and was then struck by lightning to get his powers and in the original Spider-Man there was no girlfriend of Peter Parker's know as Gwen Stacy. The only thing original from the comic book is the fact that Peter Parker has to create his own web slinging device and it does run out of its web.

Okay but nothing special,"Okay but nothing special.The first Amazing Spiderman was surprisingly good. I liked the Tobey Maguire series and felt that a reboot wasn't necessary. However, that reboot didn't feel like it is covering old ground, and felt fresh, original and energetic. It was interesting from start to finish.On the other hand, the second movie in the reboot series doesn't really add anything or feel fresh. It is pretty much a formulaic comic book adaptation.

I buy the chemistry between the actors, but not the fallout of really any of their decisions, including the villains. Especially the villain at the very end. That costume? Why god why. That actor just accepts any role I guess wow lol. How the mighty have fallen. Can see why they never made another one after this.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Webb has done it again,"This really is a golden age for fans of super-heroes movies like me with Batman, Superman, Iron Man, X-Men and more hitting the screens month after month with big budgets and even bigger takings. When a character seems to run out of steam, one just has to leave him alone for a few years and then re-boot the hero. So, after three ""Spider-Man"" movies from director Sam Raimi, Marc Webb had such a success with ""The Amazing Spider-Man"" that he's back with another winner.I actually prefer Andrew Garfield to Tobey Maguire as the titular arachnid and this outing he's somewhat schizophrenic in mood: astonishingly light-hearted in the face of any villain but really morbid when it comes to family history and current romance. There is genuine chemistry between Garfield and co-star Emma Stone (as Gwen Stacy) which is obviously helped by their real-life coupling.The chief protagonist this time is a sparky character called Electro who had an unfortunate swimming accident with some eels and James Foxx clearly had fun in a different type of role for him. The subsidiary opponent is the Green Gobin whose starring role is obviously being kept back for the next movie in the series, ensuring that we will see the creepy Dabe HeHaan again. I enjoyed the more varied use of our hero's web in this movie for a lot more than swinging from one skyscraper to another. Stan Lee has met Tim Berners-Lee, so that the web has now become world wide.There are three writing credits for this film which might explain why some characters are underwritten. Certainly I would like to have seen more of the excellent Paul Giamatti as The Rhino and newcomer Felicity Jones as Harry Osborn's assistant.

It's an OK movie but many may not like it all that much.,"After watching number one I could not wait to watch number 2. I was very disappointed. I gave it a 6 because I think their hearts were in the right place, but their minds were most of the time somewhere else. The movie was so slow in so many spots. Another problem is that things would happen and you would either scratch your head trying to understand more or have a real desire to know a lot more - but you never do. There were some inconsistencies or inadequacies. One of the things movies seem to do these days is have a scene that required the characters to do something quickly and they stand around and talk. You won't be disappointed if you are looking for that. The action sequences were far too fast and at times incoherent. It's like they were trying to see how much animation and special effects they could put in a few seconds. I could live with most of that as I do not expect Spider-Man to be the Great American Epic, but I want to be entertained without having to constantly think about things like ""why did they do that"" or ""that really does not make any sense"". And there are movies that can combine humor with very serious stuff very well. This is for sure not one of them. It was an 8.5 for me until the end. While the ending may have pleased a lot of people or not been much of a problem, for me it sucked the big one in 3 different ways. I won't tell you what they are but let you find out for yourself. While the rating on IMDb at present is a 7.1 for both movies, you will note that the second movie has only about half the votes as the first one. My guess is that word of mouth slowed ticket sales significantly, which reflected in a lot less reviews. At present box office for the 2 movies shows almost twice as much for the original. In fact, add both 1 and 2 box offices together and they are not much more than the total for the original Spider-Man 3. Numbers are adjusted for inflation. If you love Spider-Man because you like the character, this movie will satisfy you. However, if you expect more out of the movie, don't buy it - rent it. It is hard to make a number 2 as good as the number 1. But with just some minor adjustments, this could have been even better. Number one is a 10 in my book. If you do like I did and watch the movies back to back you will be even more disappointed I believe.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The destruction of possible franchise!!,"My first review on this site is of COURSE the second instalment of The Amazing Spider- Man series envisioned by 500 Days of Summer director, Marc Webb released by Columbia Pictures with a screenplay written by Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Jeff Pinker and James Vanderbilt. It was produced by Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach.I think many had very high expectations, which is one of the problems I will discuss later from an abundance of trailers that has been pumped towards TV SLOTS in the advertising campaign. One of the amazing things about the sequel, which definitely improved from the previous is the dramatisation. The first 30 minutes of the action flick provided a lot of set-up that was at the right balance and pace. Following a brief opening scene of the titular hero's parents (continued from the first movie), the current picture picks up Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Andrew Garfield) two years since the death of his Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) and Captain George Stacy (Denis Leary), Peter continues his crusade to fight crime as the web-slinger. He briefly humiliated Aleksei Systevich (Paul Giamatti) in a car chase, who with his mobsters were attempting to steal vials of plutonium.After graduation from HIGH SCHOOL with a moving speech from Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), Peter struggles to maintain his relationship with Gwen and the duties as a superhero while trying to keep a promise from George's dying wish to stay away from Gwen. To not let her daughter get between the responsibilities of crime-fighting. However, trouble brews on the horizon as now Peter as Spidey must deal with the return of Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) and formidable Max Dillon/Electro (Jamie Foxx).What this chapter of Webb's vision of the movie got right was the threat level. It was exceedingly high as the character of Peter has to deal with his inner conflict with Gwen, the lack of a father figure and the physical duress with three antagonists. My problem with the Lizard in the first trial run was the villain lacked a credible motivation and did not pose much of a challenge in terms of scale. The threat was real but not the intensity. A villain on the lackey axis than mastermind axis.The cinematography and visuals were stunning Sony did a real nice JOB with the special effects and digital animations. There were some mistakes during the edit – I will mention later but Webb's interpretation of the 'spider sense' was smooth. The acting was mostly believable as what cannot be denied is the chemistry between Garfield and Stone. Foxx managed to pull one head out in the role of the fiery, invigorating, Electro and wear the hat of socially inept and cryptic Dillon whilst DeHaan played a very menacing Harry Osborn.There were many problems with The Amazing Spider-Man 2, which did not live up to the hype as seen from the trailers. Although many of the performances from the main cast were at the very least satisfactory to brilliant; with Garfield nailing the Peter character this time around. Stone did well as Gwen, though my problem with the performance was Giamatti as Rhino. There was not much left for the actor to play with as the character and his accent as a Russian was too 'hammy' as Giamatti described. The let-down was the script, not so much story but more so dialogue, which affected parts of Garfield's portrayal in places, as well as the comedy being forced.Unlike Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3, the scope of villains for the flick was not the problem. Each nemesis Spidey faced in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 had a plausible motivation, which knit together in a joint 'arc'. The main issues were time to unravel major plot points and character development. Leave R.H.I.N.O. out of the picture, but in my opinion, Harry's transition from C.E.O. of Oscorp to crazed lunatic as a result of induced mutation through chemical mutagens felt rushed. The pacing was a lot better this time round but was a bit rapid.Another one of the many flaws this has is the fight choreography was quite weak here. First round with Electro was too easy (forget the water there is actually a scientific explanation in regard to salts in the water used to short-circuit). I won't even get into the second round and the fight against Green Goblin could of been a bit more of a struggle. It seems a lot more thought was put into the set-up to the eventual formation of the Sinister Six (look this 'team' up).Performances from Garfield, Stone, DeHaan and Foxx were mostly admirable but were affected by clunky use of crying-out-loud quips of dialogue. Best lines were ""Let's go catch a spider"", ""Yo Sparkles!"" and ""You don't give people hope, you take it away! I'm gonna take away yours!"" Aside from some out-of-place shots and underwhelming fight scenes, the visual effects, set-designs, props and costumes were stunning and the soundtrack was helped to be spectacular thanks to Pharrell Williams and Hans Zimmer's magic, even a nice end-credits wild-track from Alisha Keys and Kendrick Lamar was terrific!",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spider-man shines despite enemy follies,"I saw THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2! I have to say that I'm really becoming a big fan of this iteration of the wall crawler. Director Marc Webb and actor Andrew Garfield have really worked well to create perhaps the most believable version of Peter Parker to date, portraying him as the super smart, big mouthed, lower-middle class, New York City kid that Tobey Maguire never was. This movie has a whole lot going for it. Its got stellar performances by Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and especially Sally Field, who gives probably the best portrayal of Aunt May ever and that includes comic books! It's smart, its dramatic, action packed and at the same time it never forgets it's core message of responsibility, truth and consequences. There is a downside to the film as it pertains to villains though, as I found their motivations to be half baked and shoehorned in. The chief offender being Jamie Foxx who's portrayal of Electro is just cringe-worthy. In spite of that, I have to say that I really liked this movie a lot more than I thought I was going to and it ultimately became a fun time at the theater.

Visually grand, with excellent CGI and sound effects, but lacks effective plot and performance-capable characters.This movie is the sequel to the 2012 movie, once again centered on the figure of Spiderman. Here, young Peter Parker is very torn between Gwen's love and the fear that her action as a punisher might endanger her. Then comes a new super villain (well, the whole story about him really didn't convince me, especially when he hates Spider-Man), and it all happens too fast from there.As in the first movie, the characters are superficial and the plot is undeveloped. The cast can't shine, because they didn't give you material for it. To some extent, Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are saved for their good romantic match. The fast pace of the film and the way events run over allow no developments or delays. The film is clearly focused on the use and abuse of CGI and quality visual and sound features. Undoubtedly, they are remarkable, but they do not justify the film, which is full of dramatic and psychologically profound moments that the plot then completely wastes to the detriment of the action, CGI and show-off, which is really worth seeing. .Of all the movies about Spider-Man, I think this must be the worst, or one of the worst.",3.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Looking a bit tired...,"I may be just about near my limit for superhero movies. Either that, or nothing in The Amazing Spiderman 2 surprised me, or wowed me. It follows the standard formula of Spidey fighting two bad guys (One only introduced towards the end) across New York, a clash between his personal and vigilante life, and his on/off relationship with the only girl who knows his secret identity.But the fights, banter and plot mechanics, while done well enough, don't leap off the screen at you. Everything feels strictly routine... Even the sad 'twist' towards the end feels tacked-on in the great scheme of things. There's angst, humour and special effects in equal measure, and you won't be bored. It isn't anything memorable though, and certainly doesn't live up to the 'Amazing' monicker in the title.Still, it could be worse... At least it's not Spiderman 3 (You know, BEFORE the reboot... sigh) 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Better than the first one, but seriously flawed.","I'll be positive here- the movie did a very good job whenever spider-man was in the suit, doing his thing.It maintains (and expands) the humor of spider-man (which the Rami films really lacked), and the choreography is the best yet- Spider-man finally moves like you think he should from the comics (or video games).The villains are over-the-top (again), but for me that's part of the fun. The movie knows it's predictable, and I respect it for just kinda going with it. The acting overall is pretty on target, except from Garfield himself, who doesn't seem to know what to do during the serious scenes.The ending actually kinda surprised me. You might see it coming, but I wasn't sure...I'll give them props for that.Some of the scenes also just look really good- the CGI is *almost* to the point where it can seamlessly integrate into real footage...almost.The music was also pretty good. Not as melodic as Elfman's score, but still a fun addition to the action.Now to get all the negatives out in one paragraph: the dialogue is clichéd at best (lazy or aimless at worst), the tone of the movie is all over the place (is it campy? Is it serious? It tries to do both). The pacing is a bit off- starts with a promising sub-plot that gets a very rushed conclusion. Many characters are seemingly introduced for no reason, other than ""they're in the comic, so we'll mention them here too."" The plot over-relies on forced actions (meaning we see people change from good to bad or vice versa in the course of one scene). There's also just tons of little stupid things that are funny but unintentionally so (cinemasins will have a field day with this one).So overall...I'd recommend it if you love spider-man and just want to see some fun spider-man action, and are willing to put up with a pretty terrible script and awkward pacing. On the other hand, if you hated the ""first"" one this one might not be enough of an improvement.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Underrated but probably would've worked better as a first movie with less characters,"I gave it a 7, simply because I felt like a 6 was too low, although it may warrant such a rating.Let me start by saying I felt like the movie parts were better than the sum of those parts. The movie was very overly ambitious, although it did well to hit many important Spider-Man beats while missing many others. The most noteworthy misfire is how callously the movie casts aside Uncle Ben in favor of Peter's father and Captain Stacey who frankly are not as central. The first movie really shot itself in the foot by diminishing their relationship severely. This is supposed to be the man Peter admired and loved the most. In the comics his father is gone before Peter has made many memories of them. This movie series he has more vivid memories. But even here I found myself siding with Aunt May that essentially these were just people who abandoned him; that she and Ben were his true parents. As it should have been.However overall this movie trumps the last one, and demonstrates some understanding of Spider-Man that felt very absent in the Raimi movies. Namely the quips, his confidence while being Spider-Man versus his awkwardness as Peter, his connection to the 'common folk' of New York (although Raimi touched on this as well), making all his villains kooky science experiments, making Electro and Rhino basically overpowered henchmen as they usually are in the comics. All that stuff was great. The fight scenes were also spectacular.There's a lot in these movies that reminds me of early 80s Spider-Man, and a fair bit that reminds me of the initial Lee/Kirby runs mixed in with some of the Ultimate Spider-Man. It does a good job of ""feeling like"" a comic without coming off completely campy. This tone strikes a balance I haven't even seen in great movies like TDK and X2.The problem with the movie is the plot, or complete lack of one. That too, almost adds to the comic feel. The movie to me felt like a series of one shot issues, rather than one complete story. It felt almost like a musical, but instead of breaking into song, they broke into Spider-Man versus villain fights. But it seems like they don't know precisely where to take anyone. No one develops, no one has a Catharsis. They all just show up, overact a line or two, then move on.The movie, as I would describe it, is very raw. It's almost like Webb understands Spider-Man very well, but struggles to find what story to tell, but he knew he had to hurry up and SPOILER ALERT kill that one person we know HAS to be killed. I loved the way he handled the death. It was perfect. But that, itself could've been a movie. Electro could've been a movie. Rhino, could've gotten more to do. It's a mess.But it is a fun mess. I was entertained, so I won't be too hard on them.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Another sequel of an unnecessary reboot!,"Firstly this entire reboot was unnecessary! I mean, we were introduced to Spider- man by Sam Raimi in 2002. Tobey as Spider man, Kirsten as Mary Jane and so on. These characters and their roles were etched in our memory for a decade! 10 freaking years we could only relate to these people and we were happy.Now in 2012, they decided to reboot the entire franchise. Bloody same story with different actors! Whats the f**king point. Peter is bitten by spider, his life before and after being Spider man, his love life, his struggles with the same, relation with Uncle Ben and Aunt May, everything is the same .. but with different actors. Again.. whats the f**king point ?No doubt Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone (as Gwen Stacy) have done a good job but we tend to draw comparisons with the earlier franchise, especially when so many of the aforementioned situations are the same.Okay, now coming back to this movie. This is strictly a one-time watch movie. I didn't have much expectations anyway but I was still a bit disappointed by a few things.1. The transformation of the villain Electro was done in a bit of hurry. One moment he idolizes Spider man and next moment he hates him because he forgot his name! WTF. They should have developed his villainy character a bit. It was not at all convincing.2. Some of the things were happening for the sake of happening. It seriously lacked depth.3. Killing off the main actress and love interest of Spidey so that they can introduce another actress (most probably Mary Jane) in the next sequel, was a big turn off4. Some Characters and transformation of both villains are woefully under- developedHowever, the chemistry between Spidey and Gwen was good and some of the action sequences are pretty good. Spidey has been shown as having some sense of humor and has smart and funny one-liners. That was also welcoming",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Pass the Popcorn! review,"In spite of earning a lot of money, the first installment in The Amazing Spider-Man franchise wasn't a very good movie. It had pacing and script problems while offering nothing new in return, and it overall seemed like a pointless reboot. Luckily, there's the unwritten rule that the sequel to a superhero movie will usually be better than the original. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 follows that rule, and is better than the first one, but not by a long shot. This movie has all the big problems its predecessor had, and if this franchise wants to rise above mediocrity, these problems should definitely be solved in future movies.Beginning where the last one left, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 follows the life of Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as he somewhat struggles with being Spider-Man. He is in a relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), although he feels guilty because of it, since he promised her late father (Denis Leary) he'll stay away from her. At the same time, he encounters a new threat in form of one Max Dillon (Jamie Foxx) – an electrical engineer turned super villain during an accident. Also, Peter's childhood friend Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) returns to the city after his 8 year long absence, and he seems to have sinister plans of his own.The best thing about The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is surely the charisma between its two leads – Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. Garfield found his voice to a greater extent in this movie - he seems somewhat more relaxed and natural in his role and is arguably superior to Tobey Maguire – and, of course, Emma Stone is as sweet and likable as ever. They are accompanied by another strong performance – that of Dane DeHaan as Harry Osborn. DeHaan was a breath of fresh air to the franchise and I personally can't wait to see him in future installments. In addition to the overall quality acting, Marc Webb's direction is great, even better than in the first one. Not only that, but The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is also a nice combination of, more or less, thrilling action sequences and some grim elements which should generally entertain audiences who are looking for nothing else.However, once again, the movie utterly fails in this, perhaps most important, aspect – the script. No one expects Oscar-worthy scriptwriting from a superhero movie, but the dialogues (and some scenes) in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 are laughably ridiculous, and the character of Max Dillon aka Electro was so poorly written that even an experienced actor like Jamie Foxx couldn't save it. Furthermore, once again, the villain designs were horrible: both Electro and Green Goblin looked cartoonishly goofy. And in spite of some action sequences looking great, some of them felt like they were taken directly from a video game (which is never a good thing) and were accompanied by a cheesy dubstep-like soundtrack. In brief, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is better than its predecessor, but that unfortunately isn't enough, since the movie is, at its best, mindless popcorn entertainment, and at its worst is a serious insult to intelligence.Rating: 6/10 Read more reviews at passpopcorn.com",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Please Make it Stop,"OK this movie isn't really a one but a 7? Not quite..more like a 4. Special effects amazing of course but spiderman? Not so much. In the first 2 minutes we're watching a stereotypical looking bad guy racing a 16 wheeler through downtown city traffic with cop cars trailing him. A dangerous (not to mention physically impossible) scene. Well spidey to the rescue! With the truck smashing through cars and presumably running over people spidey makes the time to exchange some quips with the driver before stopping him. Directors guess what? Making a completely unrealistic situation takes away all the suspense! There was zero suspense in this whole thing. Nothing new to add whatsoever to the legend of spiderman. Just another brainless, heartless attempt to make more money. I was frankly sorry that I gave them my money. How about a REAL spiderman reboot?",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazing indeed,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" (2014) in my opinion is the best Spider Man movie yet, and i enjoyed it much more than any of the Marvel studios created movies yet (though i haven't see ""Guardians of the Galaxy 2014"" yet) - you can already start throwing rocks at me.Why is it so good?At 2:20 h. running time i was captivated from first till last second. Ye, it was a bit cheesy at the end in the street fight with the kid stepping in, but overall, it's a hell of a entertainment. Great special effects sequences, absolutely marvelous chemistry between two leads Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, and very captivating plot - it's all works. Althrough the sequence in which J.Foxx becomes a villain (no spoilers here) was kinda lame, he was a cool villain. And what an ending!Bottom line. As i see here at IMDb that there are many who disliked the film, here is the last nail in my review - i will wait for 3rd installment of this franchise much more that i will wait for a sequel to any Marvel movie that i have seen yet - it is superb entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

This Is What Happens When Greedy People Want Money,"I still don't know what is the point of these Amazing Spider-Man movies? Three Spider-man movies came out before, so why are the directors making the same movies again? Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are good actors, but not good as the originals. I found Tobey Maguire and Kristen Dunst way better at being Marry Jane Watson and Spiderman/ Peter Parker. I don't get what is the point of going to the movies and watching a worse version of Spiderman. Why didn't the director make a Spiderman movie with a different story line. This is what happens when greedy people want to make money and cant think outside the box. Hollywood cant come up with any new ideas? I love Spiderman, but I disliked this movie for its lack of originality.The only reason why I am giving this movie 5/10 is because of the action. There was action, but that's not enough for a movie. I watched the first Amazing Spiderman movie, and now I have watched the second. And I have to admit they are getting worse. Do not go waste your movie on this, which is an exact copy of the original Spiderman 2. What I suggest is, if you have a DVD of Spiderman 2, or have Netflix, go watch it there instead of watching this crappier version. I am not even going to see the third from how disappointed I was. Save your money and watch something original, and something you don't know what's going to happen every second.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Quite Enjoyable,"This, again, is not that bad as many users write of. The Amazing Spider-man is to me a quite good reboot. If previous movie was more about the origins, this is much more for a super-hero clash-down movie, mixed with a romance-plot enough sturdy and believable.What definitely makes this movie is again the theatricality of the villain, and of most of the battles.Something that with the previous trilogy could not be done, is a huge expansion that makes possible the making of more than a trilogy, I could explain with this the reason that the Avengers plot-line is not matching with spidey's anywhere.I'd say that comic-fans might like this, and also people that haven't grown up with the old trilogy (I myself was too young at the time).Music is something very electro-tecno like, and I wondered that Hans Zimmer actually worked on that. I guess he did the job taking a bit of his free-time, while working on that gorgeous score that he did for Interstellar.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a fun sequel that doesn't quite live up to its predecessor.,"The Amazing Spiderman 2 is a continuation of the Amazing Spiderman series, in case you didn't know (you probably already did). Peter Parker has been doing his Spiderman thing for a while, and he's pretty much pro at life. He's a famous superhero, he's graduating high school, and he's got a hot girlfriend. But then, circumstances happen. And movie happens. BEST SYNOPSIS EVER! I was looking forward to this movie. I did enjoy The Amazing Spiderman quite a bit and I was hoping the sequel would be good. It was, but the first is still better. Let's start off with some things that I liked. Andrew Garfield is the best Peter Parker that we've ever had. He's charming, he's funny, he's a good actor, and he just flat out looks like he can be Spiderman. Everyone else does a really good job, too. Emma Stone was a great Gwen Stacy, Jamie Foxx was a good Electro, and Dane Dehaan was a good Harry Osbourne. I would say Paul Giamatti was a good Rhino but we'll get to that later. The action is a lot of fun. It's fast paced, exciting, and just a thrill to watch. There's lots of punching, kicking, flipping, and electricity. You can easily tell that a lot of care was put into the action to make it look awesome and it certainly does. There is a little slow motion, but it takes such a small part of the action that it's hardly noticeable. The best thing about this movie is its look. I mean, this movie is just gorgeous. The cinematography is excellent, the city is really cool to look at, the special effects are awesome. That's really the best part of the look. The special effects. Especially Electro's electricity. Having all that electricity running through Jamie Foxx's body was just really cool to look. And when he uses that power yeah. It's awesome. However, there is a fair amount wrong with this movie. For starters, the story. Don't get me wrong; the story is good. It's written well and it follows the comics pretty well (Or so I've heard. I haven't read any of the comics. Shoot me.). But, the problem with this story (or stories, as I should say) is that there are too many. This movie suffers in the same way that ""3 Days to Kill"" suffers in which the many plot lines makes the movie look focus. At one point, Spiderman is trying to spend time with his girlfriend. At another, he's trying to find the secret behind his parent's disappearance. At another, he's trying to hide his identity from his aunt. At another, he's reconnecting with an old friend. At another, we have Gwen Stacey's side story. At another, we have Max's (Electro's ) side story. At another, we have Harry Osbourne's side story. It's just too much. Another problem I have with this movie is the same problem I have with the first Amazing Spiderman; the villains. I do think, as a whole, the villains were executed better in this movie than in the first. But, each villain has their own flaws that make them not as strong as they could be. And since there are three, I feel like I should go over each one of them separately. First off, we have Max becoming Electro. Now, when Max actually becomes Electro, he's pretty awesome. But before, he acts way too cartoony. I mean, I get it, Max is supposed to be obsessed with Spiderman, but I feel like it was overdone to the point of being corny. The delivery just took me out of the movie. Next, we have Harry Osbourne becoming Green Goblin. I think Dane Dehaan was absolutely fantastic as the character. This guy does a great job at being evil. However, I didn't care about the character. When you have this villain that pretty much drives the story like Harry Osbourne does, I want to connect with this character. That's the great thing about the first Spiderman trilogy. Before he turned, Harry Osbourne was a really awesome, likable guy. I just didn't like or care about the Harry in this movie. And then we have Paul Giamatti as the Rhino. There are so many things wrong with this. First off, the Rhino is only in this two and a half hour movie for about two minutes. He's pretty much here to set up the Sinister Six plot line, I get it, but if you're in the movie for that little and for no purpose, then what's the point? Second, the delivery is way too over the top. I get it, he's supposed to be a crazy killer, but Paul Giamatti's deliver is just so poorly done. He just looks stupid. Third, WHY THE HECK DOES THE RHINO HAVE A ROBOTIC SUIT? He's supposed to have a skin-tight rhino suit that he can never take off. I mean, the robot suit would be okay if it looked cool, but I wasn't impressed. It really just looked like it was thrown together last minute and they threw Paul's face on it. I did not like this. If you wait until the end to see what after credits clip will be here to segway this movie to the next you will be disappointed. Don't worry, there is an after credits scene, but it's just a promo for an upcoming Marvel movie. This movie is not worth staying until after the credits unless you want to see Jennifer Lawrence kick butt. Overall this was a pretty fun movie. The acting was great, the chemistry worked, the look of the movie was just fantastic, and the action was fun to watch. However, these certain setbacks prevent this movie from being a completely worthy sequel. If you walk into this movie thinking this is going to be the definitive Spiderman movie, then you will probably be disappointed. But, as it stands, I really enjoyed this movie and I wish this series the best.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Best Spider-Man Film Yet?,"NON SPOILER REVIEW!I actually really enjoyed this movie its got the best action scenes out of all the spiderman movies and electro and green goblin are so much better than doctor octopus, the first green goblin and the rest of the villains from spiderman 3.Although the story is a little forced and rushed, you definitely believe the Gwen/Peter love. You might feel sympathy for electro but you might also think he is a psychopath which kinda works, and you can't deny that the electro visuals are AMAZING.With harry you do feel sympathy but you see him quickly turn and turn again into the green goblin which looks awesome by the way.Don't go to the cinema expecting The Dark Knight but go expecting the best spiderman movie to date that will be a joy to watch with anyone.Final Verdict : 8.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Good action flick, better than it's predecessor.","When the Spider-man movie franchise was rebooted, I was not in favor of it, I actually was among those people who enjoyed the Sam Raimi films, regardless of the fact that Spiderman 3 did not deliver. I was actually looking forward to Spider-man 4 till they decided they had to reboot the franchise. I thought the reboot was really unnecessary. Andrew Garfield does have the younger, college boy look, more so than Toby Maguire to be Spider-man like he is in the comics and the 1994 animated series. Plus they also added more believable elements, like he used gadgets to create webbing, just like in the comics, which was far more believable than the Sam Raimi's movies.Unfortunately the first film had too many mysteries too many secrets about Parker's parents which were not cleared up at all by the end, they also kind of ruined the tragic Uncle Ben scene and Garfield's acting in that situation was not good. Plus the first film dragged on and on till the lizard showed up which was too late in the film, and the love story was not developed well at all like it was in the Sam Raimi's films in my honest opinion. Plus Spiderman looked really weak in the entire film, he needed way to much help to stop the lizard. What I did like was Garfield's humorous jokes as Spiderman, specially his interactions with the lizard otherwise the movie failed to impress.The Amazing Spiderman 2 on the other hand does many things right, it first clears up what happened to Parker's parents, the reason for their sudden departure, much better scenes between Gwen and Parker. And honestly an overall interesting plot. Harry's family back-story and the Oscorp back-story is extremely interesting and I was deeply invested in his character. Jamie Fox was actually good after his TRANSFORMATION before that he just came off like an idiot or a goofy spider-man fan-boy. Electro came off as a tough and believable villain and his fight scenes against Spiderman were done very well.Unlike it's prequel the film keeps me interested for most of it's duration mainly the scenes involving Electro and Harry, the interactions between Parker/Spidey and Harry were also done excellently. The climax was also good but unfortunately for me the ending was ruined on the net before I watched the film. But I still think this film also ended on a high note and I am actually interested in the sequel, and that is not something that came to my mind after watching the first film.I also felt Garfield did better in the emotional scenes this time around. Emma Stone was pretty much the same like she was in the last film, Jamie Fox was great as the dangerous Electro and James De Haan was just awesome in his role. The supporting cast also did a good job.The film's overall plot is good, but it is not what carries it strong performances from the main cast, regardless of cliché dialogs, the film also uses great high-tech graphics and CGI those action scenes are fantastic even better than the last film, all fight and action scenes were done well and were all fun to watch. Unfortunately the serious dialogs scenes were boring and kind of dragged on, dragging this movie down for me.Overall this is a fun action that is a good watch for any Spiderman fan, but I still love the Animated Series the most.Overall: 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"just OK, Should of been much better.","This movie was a big let down. It wasn't bad, but it seemed as if this movie felt very forced with many unnecessary scenes. It definitely wasn't edited properly. There are many mini plots and scenes that have no significance. At times I felt like this movie had to fill out a checklist of scenes that had to be in the movie even thought they don't fit into the story, which they are many. The acting was great. Dane was my favorite character. And it's nice to see Spider-man being silly and making jokes with his enemies. I thought the CGI was a little bit too much. I liked it better when film makers used CGI to make things seem more realistic. Now it seems as if it's used to make things look more like a cartoon. The villains weren't developed properly. Electro wasn't a good villain because he had no clear motive. He was a psychological mess. These types of people don't make good villains in movies, neither in real life. This movie has no excuses. They just needed to find a reason for him to hate spider-man, it's poor screen writing. Rhino and Goblin are in it for an insignificant amount of time. There was no room for them, but they squashed them in anyway. But the main reason why I didn't enjoy it was because of the story and it's structure. The audience can't get emotionally involved with anything because there are too many plots. When this movie kept switching plots around you sometimes forget that other things are going on. And when they reappear you don't care anymore. This film tried to put too many apples in a bag that wasn't big enough, so the bag broke. The script had many other flaws, especially with dialogue. The script was the main reason why this movie suffered. I guess they should of thrown out that checklist.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not the Spider-man we deserve,"The film had too many villains just like Spider-man 3. Surprisingly Marc Webb didn't cared for them and instead he tend towards his trademark romance.

Vfx and 3D were excellent.Hans Zimmer did a good job but his music didn't fit a teen hero like Spidey.Overall, lead pair romance with an emotional ending, one or two action sequences and Vfx were good.. but the villainy was bad.I didn't get disappointed since these films are just starters and we'll see the real Spidey and some imp characters like Mary Jane, JJ Jameson, Dr. Octopus and Venom are yet to come.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"Better than first part, but too much dialogues and less action.","First of all the name is amazing spider man 2. From the name we can say that the film is about spider man. But unfortunately it's not about spider man but more about Peter. All the actors did a good job, no question in that. Marc Webb did a comparatively better job than the first film. Then where's the problem? It's Kurtzman, Orci, Pinkner and Vanderbilt. Too much pressure on story resulting in excessive talking throughout the film. I'm not saying that it should be a story-less action film, but they should understand that it's a feature film and not a TV series (they should balance between the story and action). Secondly, too many characters. There is no need for so many characters. As a result not enough space was given to any character. There was no need to bring rhino. Instead they should have given more space to harry osborn. Electro only fights twice and the duration of the fight scene is very small. Webb did a wonderful action sequence but the pressure of excess story diminished everything. And finally at the end, x men. Omg. Will they merge the two universe?",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Ehhhhh,"Entertaining? sure. I wouldn't pay money at a theatre to see it tho.I still don't understand Jamie Foxx's role in this movie; completely rushed and undetermined. There is a serious correlation between his character and Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze in the old George Clooney Batman movie. The villain in this movie was seriously underdeveloped.Being an admirer of the the Amazing Spiderman, I was hoping the same movie elements would exist, and they did...but not without the pitfalls. Sequels always have a way of falling flat.I will give a nod to the indie shot in the bedroom scene. This movie, cinematography-ly speaking is all over the friggin map. You got awesome cgi, hand-held prosumer DSLR's, super syncopated slo-mo and Paul Giamatti talking in a terrible Russian accent in a full metal rhinoceros body suit - that is no lie my fellow IMDb friends.Spiderman really needs a new story, one that audience haven't seen before and this movie is all the same ole same ole with a bit of a better ending.

A Good Action Packed 3 D experience for this Summer,"It was a Great action packed superhero movie especially the Action and the on-screen chemistry between the characters. Direction was pretty decent with slow motion in the action sequences and flips between high fuel action. Acting was decent too and I felt touched with the Peter/Gwen story. So what is wrong with the movie? Well, there were some events which seemed misplaced and few (awesome) scenes which were deducted to improve the pace of the movie. That is where I lost the touch with the characters. Still this movie provides some serious Action and Drama and a Bit of comedy as well. Overall, it is fun to watch Spider man flying (kind of) between the skyscrapers and Electro breaking those same buildings in a flash. Characters Peter, Gwen and Max have been portrayed well by their respective actors. Also Harry Osborne's character could have been given more time on-screen (which is also well portrayed) .This movies Action is its center of Attraction which will hit you with so many waves considering which I give it a 'Seven' out of 'Ten'.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
The Amazing Spider Man 2 and this whole reboot series sure seems like a big question mark,"In 2012, the first Spider-Man came out from the new reboot series and it came out in a very ""out of the blue"" way. I can't say I never did appreciate a Spider-Man film though because Spider-Man is for sure one of my favorite superheroes out there. Why though, would they create a Spider-Man series five years after the last film in the original series?The Amazing Spider-Man of 2012 still was a positive even with all the hate I give it. It brought in new rising stars who we got to know and it played well in the summer market. The film got a new audience for this famous Marvel character and it generated sequels.In this movie, following the events in last movie, Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is really up in the air (no pun intended) with his relationship with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) and a new villain, Electro (Jamie Fox) comes into the spotlight. Peter Parker also must deal with an old friend Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan) who is now in charge of Oscorp and who's emotions turn him into the villain the Green Goblin. Parker is sure dealing with lot of stuff and it's starts to show.Andrew Garfield is again likable which makes you wish he was around more often in films. He has very good chemistry with his co-star Emma Stone but the story of them trying to solve their relationship is surely past done by now. Still though, they make this film and I don't know where this film would be without the two of them together. Electro is nerdy and not a mentally stable guy and it's quite interesting for him to be in this film because he is not the most known villain in the Spider-Man universe which makes him original. The special effects with him are quite quirky and of a different vibe than what we have seen before but like the most characters in this film, his pacing is way off. Rising star, Dane DeHaan known for the forgotten but solid film Chronicle is just as silly as Electro but it's Dehaan himself who eventually who ruins this character for us. He can't develop the character himself making it a mundane character nor is his acting really up to a par. Even the usually lovable Sally Field as Aunt Jane is nowhere to be found and really adds nothing to film even when she is around.There also isn't much of a plot here. Sure, these characters do add something but a large portion of the film wanders around going nowhere and the movie has some really bad pacing. You would expect the typical long, action battle scenes to end the story and here the last battle scene sure does change the whole series. The main settings is New York City which it had to be but really you know what you are getting with this setting by now. It' a plot that has a lot to it but doesn't really go anywhere with it. I give the substance here a barely passing grade.These are probably some reasons why this is movie is getting hated on after only one week at the top of the box office. You have wonder what Sony Pictures thinks of the future now for this series. This reboot continues to introduce us to new things to this character that we never thought would come to us but still fails to deliver the necessary stuff to make a really good Spider-Man film. I can't even say that I'm even looking forward to the likely sequels coming in the next few years and I never said this when the original sequels were coming. The Amazing Spider Man 2 and this whole reboot series sure seems like a big question mark to me.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Spidey Swings back into Action for an Entertaining Time!,"I enjoyed 'The Amazing Spider-Man"". It was effective particularly given it was a reboot, not too long after the Rami-MacGuire Movies. Andrew Garfield did well, but one complaint many had was he was very introverted, and it lacked a lot of the classic humor from the character in the Comics. Not So in The Amazing Spider-Man 2!Garfield's Spider-man is much more humorous and outgoing in this one! Garfield and Emma Stone (Gwen Stacey) continue their great chemistry from the 1st one, and Sally Field (Aunt May) also returning is great again. Dan DeHann's Harry Osborne is a true highlight. Jamie Foxx does well as ""Electro"". It should be noted not too much is given on his character's background, but it does little too diminish the movie. Tone Wise, The First ""Amazing Spider-Man"" is much better, and much more consistent. The changes in tone, is a fair criticism of the movie, as at times possibly the movie may be too fast paced, but in the end - It was Fun! 3 out of 4 Stars!",8.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A very good Spidy Movie,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 [2014]Rating: 7/10 Review:Its a HIT from my end. First of all, i was disappointed with the negative reviews which gave just 50% scores. Guys!

"Amusing, but not as good has the first one.","Two years later, Peter Parker(Andrew Garfield) is enjoying life as the web slinging wall crawling crime fighter Spider Man, and is dating the love of his love Gwen Stacy(Emma Stone), but then Peter starts to remember the promise he to Captain Stacy before he died, to stay away from Gwen so he would not put her in danger, mean while some new villains are looking to destroy Spider Man.The villains I did not feel where used to there potential, I mean they are just there nothing more, Dane Dehaan and Jamie Fox are okay in there roles. And action scenes are alright not great, so where the effects. But the scenes with Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone are enjoyable, there scenes together really work, cause they have such great chemistry. Like I said Amusing.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Amazingly bad movie,"I went to see this movie with some friends on a Friday night. I didn't expect anything from this film, unless to be enjoyable. I was nothing less that amazed by the stupidity of the whole thing, even if it didn't start badly... The first sequence where Spider-Man chase a truck in Manhattan is at some point very impressive. The moment when we follow Spidey flying between the building, we almost feel like if we were with him. In fact, we could resume the movie with what I have already told : most of the action sequence are well directed, but apart from that, there's nothing to be satisfied with. Half of the film is focused on the Peter-Gwen love story, and I can guarantee you that you will do nothing else than sigh. And the villains! There's a lot to talk about (but not in good sadly...). To not spoil you, I will only speak about Electro. At first, his name is Max, but the problem is, that you don't have enough scene to understand the psychology of the character (if there is one), so you just think that he's just a very stupid guy, and I have to say that Jamie Foxx's interpretation is probably for something. And when he turn into a bad guy, well... we almost don't see his power until the last thirty minute, where Marc Webb must have noticed that we had seen enough of cheesy scene between the two lovers. So we get a terrible action scene, where the director put all the element he can. But it just turn amazingly bad, and we almost have an overdose of bad CGI - because yes, the CGI are bad. I could write a lot more to convince to not spend one dollar for this movie, but it would turn just as boring as the film was... The first was bad, the second is worse.",4.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Masterpiece!,"I started re-watching all the Spiderman films for the upcoming Spider-Man No way Home. I watched Sam-Raimi franchise followed by Marc Webb franchise.Trust me The Amazing Spiderman Film Series is the best till date.It got a lot of disappointment and underrating because it was a reboot of Spiderman franchise and not because the actual film.Seriously production studios suck.I recommend every single person to watch The Amazing Spiderman Series, who wants to know who really Spiderman is.🕷",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
A Fine Spidey Movie...,"Andrew Garfield returns for the sequel to ""The Amazing Spider-man"" also known as the shortest Spider-man movie series, with only two movies included. But what about this one? Was it entertaining? Yes, it was very entertaining. Holding action with great suspenseful music and the plot and story was building up more and more for every minute. Great story development, with greatly introduced characters and good plot twists. Many unexpected turns that sometimes was good and sometimes unnecessary and meh. The reason it became a little lower rating was mostly because of the unnecessary plot twist at the end, and they dragged the story too long, the film could be at least twenty minutes shorter. Andrew Garfield as Spider-Man (Peter Parker) was playing great and from my view better than in the previous. He had expression and got deep into the character. His love connection with Gwen Stacy was very well performed and showed us step by step. The interesting concept here was also the unsure knowing of who was the villain. Sometimes you could think that, sometimes you could think another way, and I really liked that. I liked that it was a question of who the villain really was, and everything got revealed more in the second act. The action sequences were amazing. Spider-mans webs were flying here and there, unique camera angles and epic swings and fades. Very great suspenseful music, with a good upbuilding beat. The visual effects were on the middle. Very decent, and could have been programmed much better. I can even say that the original Spider-man movie from 2002 did have a better quality with greater originality. To conclude, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was an entertaining superhero movie, holding action, great story development and fine acting. Could have been twenty minutes shorter and the effects could be better made, but overall, it was ok.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
webb's web is just unbearable,"where should i start ? i had high hopes for this film but everything is ruined . the bad acting ,bad one liners ,too childish plot ,villains are just boring and useless, direction is nothing compared to Sam Raimi's .andrew garfield is just too boring and over the top .simply put he cannot act .Jamie foxx was wasted in the film .the CGI was so pathetic that it was unbearable .the director was high or something when he was directing . Dan de han is simply atrocious .his awkward turning into a villain is just mindless crap .and last but not the least Rhino whose CGI is the most horrible one i have seen till date looks like a over-sized tin can . my opinion is that give the rights back to marvel they sure do knows how to make a superhero film . go waste your money if you want to at your risk . my verdict : HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for 2 year old babies",1.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Crowded but good,"The Amazing Spider-Man 2 dials things up from its predecessor. There's more at stake both emotionally and physically for Peter Parker.While the actors continue to look too old for their parts, they play their roles excellently and Emma Stone is the star. The visual effects are very well done. The writing is great, the ending is dramatic and emotional thanks to excellent exposition across the film. The chemistry between the leads and balancing two lives continues to be the highlight.The movie suffers under its unfocused direction and balancing too many characters ineffectively, but that doesn't make it a bad.The movie is great and likely better than the first. If it wasn't dragged down by being overly busy it could be a lot better, perhaps separating it into 2 films would have been beneficial.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Good Second Installment,"Spider Man 2 is a good next installment!!! Went to an early screen and found that I left cinema thinking about how this series is going to take a downhill turn eventually, not sure if that will be the 3rd film or the 4th but it will happen; however not as bad as lets say Pirate's of the Caribbean.

Movie Review,"'The not-so amazing Spider-Man 2'. Spidey returns for his most most difficult battle yet - cramming as much web swinging, mid-air pirouettes and cheesy (but often cleverly timed) typical Spidey chat lines in a certain amount of time (142 minutes). Even though the special effects of this film will leave you almost on the edge of your seat, the most memorable and enjoyable scenes from Marc Webb's newest instalment of the 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is the refreshing on-screen chemistry between Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) and Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield).Jamie Foxx's portrayal of the eccentrically creepy Max Dillon who happens to stumble into his own world of trouble when he is transformed from the geeky Spider-Man loving employee of Oscorp to the easily manipulated, mayhem-causing Spider-Man loathing Electro. Jamie Foxx brought a new feeling to the category of Spidey villains by seeming misunderstood and mentally unable to cope. However Electro is not the only villain who seeks to wreck havoc, the Green Goblin (Dane DeHaan) returns in his best form yet.Yet again the 'Spider-Man' franchise has thrown one too many enemies into the movie. Due to the abundance of villains that Parker has to face, we only get half of the story. In 'The Amazing Spider-Man' we was allowed to look deeply into Dr. Curt Connors'/ The Lizard's (Rhys Ifans) mind and see what was torturing him so much. However having too many evil characters did not allow Webb enough time to develop them enough so we could fully understand them. Maybe for the next film the franchise should take some notes from Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and concentrate on a single brute who wishes to rid Gotham of the Dark Knight.The public's current favourite heroin, Gwen Stacey, is back looking as good as ever and certainly does not disappoint. If you did not already know (as of the writing of this review) Emma Stone and Andrew Garfield have been dating for over a year, and it definitely shows on the big screen. Webb succeeded more in creating a realistic, awkward but genuine typical teen relationship, teenage boys everywhere are still jealous of Spider- Man but now it is not because of his incredibly envy inducing web-swinging abilities, it is because of gorgeous down-to-Earth girlfriend. The whole reason this cinematic mix-up is worth watching is because the unique couple lighten up the atmosphere of the film that will make you feel you are right in the middle of them.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Finally a superhero movie that is credible to the comics.,"I went to watch the second part of Mark Webb's Spider-Man franchise yesterday. As it's precedent it stars Adrew Garfield as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy and Sally Field as Aunt May. Both Martin Sheen and Dennis Leary who portrayed Uncle Ben and Captain Stacy make cameo appearances in this film as well. The film also introduce new characters; Max Dillon/Electro (Jamie Foxx), Harry Osborn (Dane DeHaan), Aleksei Sytsevich/Rhino (Paul Giamatti)and Felicia Hardy (Felicity Jones). Unlike it's previous film the musician is Hanz Zimmer, who replaced James Horner.The actors's performances are outstanding, specially by actors Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. Garfield's body-language is better than Maguire's and he is way more curious, funny and emotional. Although Tobey Maguire was a great Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Garfield is a notch better. Emma Stone is a great choice to portray Gwen Stacy. The chemistry between her and Garfield is outstanding. Sally Field's performance as Aunty May/May Parker is marvelous and she has a bigger role in this one than it's previous venture. She is very secretive and is kind of a selfish woman who hides a lot of things for her nephew Peter. Jamie Foxx who portrayed Dillon was great even though the character is portrayed by a black actor. Dane DeHaan who played Harry Osborn/Green Goblin was good. Not as great as James Franco to play Harry Osborn, but better than Willem Dafoe to play Green Goblin.The film's storyline is well-built and it's more credible to the comic books than the previous Spider-Man films. It digs deeper about Peter Parker's past and his parents's disappearance. It's more humorous, more emotional and it has a more darker tone which keeps the film interesting to watch. The costumes are stylish and more high-tech and the CGI effects are amazing. However, I felt that the final battle between Spider-Man and Electro maybe had a bit too much effects. Even though the scenes where we see Spider-Man swinging around New York City is epic, I still miss James Horner's music. Zimmer's music is cool, but I felt that it wasn't that suitable as Horner's tunes.The movie is simply amazing and it deserves to be watched in the cinemas. Two thumbs way up!",9.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
not as good as the first,"First let me start by saying that this movie is too damn long, almost 2 and a half hours and that is too much for a movie like this. I didn't really like Jamie Foxx's electro character because I thought he was lame and it was kind of cliché how he got he's powers. The entire movie was like a roller-coaster ride. Peter's relationship with Gwen, electro, peter's relationship, electro etc and it was kind of annoying. Another thing people might not catch was that THE SUIT WAS DIFFERENT! I don't know if it's just me, but the sit in this movie looked a lot cheaper then the first and that was one of the things I liked about the movie. Too long, mixed plot with to many characters and weird suit, but on a good note there was good things about the film. The action was pretty good and the special effects want bad either. I know I complained about the time length of the movie but at least I got my moneys worth. Overall don't really get too hype for this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Save yourself some time,"A script this bad can only be written by a lobotomised amoeba.There is actually no saving grace in this movie, none at all. It's simply not worth watching.

The Worst Spider-Man Movie,"I have seen quite a few of negative reviews about ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" and the Andrew Garfield franchise as a whole, so I had quite low expectations for the two movies. While the first movie was alright (5/10), this one was not good at all, the acting lost its authenticity, Garfield's performance in this movie is the most inauthentic Spider-Man performance I have seen. Other supporting actors such as Foxx and Stone were okay but did not do much to stand out. The plot is messy and I do not understand why 2 villains, Electro was suffifcent and the final battle was not really enternaining to watch. Some of the visual effects were alright in this movie, but other most prominent effects such as Electro and the Electric visual effects were not impressive and felt ripped-off from some other Marvel or Sci-Fi movie.Overall, I think I can deduce that this is the worst Spider-Man movie I have watched, it really dissapoints at all levels unfortunately. Messy plot, bad acting and crappy visual effects. Please do not watch, in fact do yourself a favor and avoid the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man franchise, both the Tom Holland and the Tobey Maguire franchises are a hell of a lot better than this one in almost every way.",2.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not worthy,"I really wanted to believe in this Spider-Man. After the reboot the first movie was okay though I still personally prefer the McGuire trilogy. But this movie ate dirt.It feels unedited. There are moments that drag on where you have time to wonder what the hell they are doing and how this is contributing to the plot or character development (short answer, it isn't). The moments where we see some genuine interaction between Peter and Gwen feel tainted by the same thing.The ""romance"" of the two is selfish and driven largely by Peter's wants and ego. I didn't like it at all. And as for the rest of the movie... most of the motivations were just off or not there at all.I gave it a 4 because I feel 5 is too generous. I might re-watch a 5 movie again, but I won't be watching this one again.",,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Fun But Flawed,"Despite it not receiving the kindest critical reviews during its initial release, I was a huge fan of 2012's ""The Amazing Spider-Man"". A brand new re-imagining of the popular comic book story, it had surprisingly great performances and amounted to one of the most entertaining films of that year. And after being so keen on the first movie I was extremely excited to hear that ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" was finally going to hit theaters. It may not have lived up to my immense expectations but notwithstanding its many flaws, I really enjoyed it.We pick up our story with Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) as he struggles to balance his relationship with Gwen (Emma Stone) along with his responsibility as Spider-Man. With fresh villains emerging, including an uber-cheesy Jamie Foxx as Electro and a creepy Green Goblin, he is forced to choose between his own problems and the dangers that face the city. On a much bigger scale than its predecessor, and wildly more lively, it's more of a crowd-pleaser than anything else.It has various issues concerning the antagonists, but the strongest points lie in the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone, who provide the most heartwarming and endearing scenes. I realize the film may not be for everyone, but I found to be charming and amusing amidst its problems. Rated PG-13 for action, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is fun but flawed.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Is it just me or?,"The way Dane DeHaan portrays the Goblin is ridiculous?

Very well done if slightly run of the mill,"Given that this is the fifth Spiderman movie in twelve years, it's very easy to feel cynical when the clichés start flying out of the screen before the first action set piece finishes. After all, it's not enough any more that Peter Parker is going to pull an innocent bystander out of the way of a car spinning through the air and be late to an important event which his girlfriend has put a lot of emotional investment in to. Oh no, now he's got to have a dark secret at the heart of his family and be the very centre piece of an evil conspiracy as well. Because having him played by an actor who looks uncomfortably similar to Stan Laurel isn't a big enough difference any more.However, one inevitable side effect of the sheer volume of superhero movies being made in recent years is that Hollywood has got very, very good at making them. And The Amazing Spider Man 2 is a very, very good movie. It doesn't get close to the high water mark set by The Dark Knight of course but it's definitely a step up from the first entry in the rebooted franchise and could put in a good case for being superior to any of the Sam Raimi movies as well.Sure, there are faults to be had but the film speeds along on such sheer, good natured fun that it's hard to be bothered by them. As Peter Parker, the annoyingly youthful Andrew Garfield (he's 30 years old people, 30 years old!) is a charming and effortlessly charismatic screen presence. As he zips through New York at high speed, wise cracking at bad guys and high-fiving firemen, you get the distinct impression that he really enjoys being a superhero. There's still time for him to be bothered by guilt and struggle with his responsibilities, but it doesn't weigh him or the film down and he's tremendous fun to spend time with.He's ably supported by Emma Stone as Parker's on again/off again girlfriend Gwen Stacey. The pair's real life relationship translates incredibly well on screen and there's so much chemistry between them, it's hard not to shake the feeling that both actors want to get the scene over and done with so they can go back to shaking trailers together. Dane Dehaan meanwhile makes a bid for this year's Best Sympathetic Villain In A Spiderman Movie award as Harry Osborn. Dehaan is making a career out of playing traumatised young men with incredible power, but it's a credit to both the actor and the script that he becomes genuinely likable, even when he's committing appalling acts against the people he loves.On the other hand, it is difficult to believe that Jamie Foxx could ever be a nerd, especially as the guy who bullies him at work looks like someone Foxx could break in two by breathing hard enough, but he makes a formidable villain when he inevitably becomes Electro. His Times Square smack down with Spidey is one incredible set piece and their later ruck in a power plant only ups the ante. If the appearance of Paul Giamatti's Rhino on the posters meanwhile has you worried about villain fatigue fear not, he's barely more than a cameo.So, great cast, awesome set pieces, what's the catch? Well just like the first Amazing Spider Man, this film still can't help but be a bit unnecessary. You'll have seen all of Parker's dilemmas in this before and the needless conspiracy subplot involving his folks never comes across as anything more than a way for the studio to say ""See, completely different film?""The strengths outweigh the weaknesses however and aside from a few uncomfortable points (what's with the Mengele style German Doctor?), The Amazing Spider Man 2 is a fine superhero movie. It's great fun to watch, has an immensely likable duo at it's heart and just when it's getting a bit too familiar, it pulls the rug out from under your feet with a wicked third act. If this is Hollywood at it's money grabbing worst, long may it continue.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Not so amazing but still entertaining,"While the studio was too busy to create spectacular action sequences, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" struggles with nonstructural plot, comical script and weak character development. The movie is overstuffed with unnecessary material and some coincidences moment that would make audiences feel exhausted also appearing many new characters affected this second installment into unfocused at storyline. Marc Webb as director seems confused to gather the two main villain and failed to introduce them properly. Surprisingly, the positive side of the movie comes from Peter Parker-Gwen Stacy's love story. Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone successfully to portrait two teenagers who are madly in love and their chemistry put this movie into a different level of superhero franchise though it sometimes feels more like soap opera. Overall despite poor executed at storyline, ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"" is undeniably romantic and still entertaining as summer blockbuster movie, also an unbelievable performance from Andrew Garfield has stolen sympathy that is needed and promisingly opens a gate to the next chapter of Spider-Man.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

Cool,"Sure thing! ""Swinging into the cinematic web of The Amazing Spider-Man 2 was an electrifying experience, much like Spidey himself. The actors brought their A-game, with Andrew Garfield's portrayal of the iconic web-slinger filled with charisma and emotional depth. The film's editing spun a visually dynamic narrative, though a tad tangled at times. Strengths gleamed through in the thrilling action sequences that left me clinging to the edge of my seat, and the music hit the right notes, enhancing the adrenaline-fueled moments. Yet, every hero has their kryptonite, and in this case, a slight weakness was the crowded plot, juggling multiple storylines like a web-slinger in overdrive. The cinematography, however, soared to new heights, capturing the essence of New York City with breathtaking shots. Despite the occasional stumble, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 swings its way to a 7/10 in my book, a web of entertainment that had me hooked.""",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""If You've Got A Daddy Issue, Here's A Daddy Tissue!""","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)-It turns out that THIS is the worst Spider-Man film. I'm not sure what they did between the last film and this one, but they went wrong.It still hasn't got a cast that particularly excites me. While Andrew Garfield has grown on me and he still gives a really emotive performance that had obviously been well prepared for, none of the others were anything above good. I certainly wouldn't hand out any Oscar's.I think that they tried too hard with adding characters for future set ups in sequels that didn't happen, because this one just didn't cut the mustard.I didn't mind the 'Rhino' elements and if it had been just him in those few scenes then it probably would have worked better and given more time for Electro, played by Jamie Foxx, to shine in his role and cause the appropriate chaos for his part, which could have been awesome, based on his super powers, but instead they brought in Harry Osborn as well.Not only that, but they chose an incredibly bratty and pre-pubescent, spoiled child direction for the character and an actor who seemed to fit the role too well. Maybe when his voice finally breaks, he won't seem quite so unsettling.I use the word grated to refer to things in my reviews a lot and probably too much, but he really made my skin uneasy and ""Grated"" on me.With his addition to the cast, he lowered the maturity of the story, making it very teenaged. It could almost have been a poorly made episode of 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer'. Teenagers with monster problems.Looking at the people that they turned down to play Harry Osborn, all I can assume is that this guy was less expensive than the others?Although I am not a fan of Jamie Foxx at all, I did feel that he was wronged by this film. He didn't get a chance to prove his acting abilities, as he was overshadowed by romantic relationship issues, a friend who was creepy before anything else even happened and too much focus on incorporating Easter Eggs, such as references to Doc Ock and The Vulture, among others.I'd like them to realise that one villain is enough if they're going to spend time showing the development of the other characters. Spider-Man got lost amongst everyone else's problems and it's supposed to be a film about him.I think it also gets irritating that the lead characters all have issues surrounding their fathers. That theme is a bit heavy handed throughout and weighs the mood of the film down.It's still got that darker touch to it that the first 'Amazing Spider-Man' (2012) had, but they've added comedic and camp elements that make it more like the superhero films of the eighties.I don't mind the banter that Spidey has, but he's so overly cocky and I'm sure that's deliberate, to give room for him to be brought down a peg or two, but with everything else it became too much. The real story should have been his fights with 'Electro' whilst he tried to maintain an ordinary life with Gwen and how the results that occurred, because of who he is, affected him and his relationships. Basically adding Harry took it too far.It does have a more comic book edge to it and actually it reminds me of Tim Burton's 'Batman Returns' (1992) in its style, but I don't think that it's good enough for the 2010's and I have grown to expect a lot more from Marvel since this one was made.It's a shame that Mr Garfield didn't get the chance to showcase his Spider-Man incarnation more, as the material was overworked and the B & C list of supporting cast that he had to work with didn't really excite. To be fair they didn't have a lot to get on with.It's watchable, but don't worry about pausing it to make a cup of tea, because there's not enough depth to miss out on.556.87/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Best Spider,"I liked very much the movie.One of the best of Spider. The action was very good and the comedy were so well placed. I knew this movie will be a 10 stars movie , from the others.. But this had something more. The effect are so brilliant, and the movie was kind of complicated sometimes(the story of Peter's dad). However the ending was sad and I can't understand how that could happened... I was so disappointed. I couldn't believe it. In the end I want to say that the drama was very high. Good job , and I am waiting for the next Spider-Man. P.S. I really liked the relationship between Gwen and Peter, I hope that ""the new Spider-Man"" will be as romantic as this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"More of the same - an uneven, overblown CGI-fest","Spiderman (Andrew Garfield) faces off against Electro (Jamie Foxx), an electrically-charged super villain. Typical MCU PG shtick: a superhero cracking wise while saving the city from violent but mostly bloodless carnage. Garfield is OK as the web-slinger but much of his dialogue was strained and contrived, especially the incessant quips. Emma Stone makes for a striking Gwen Stacy but the character's 'deux ex machina' arrival in the power plant was a silly plot twist and Jamie Foxx is fine as the syntho-voiced and largely CGI Electro but painfully awful as pre-villain nebbish Max Dillion. The film seems rushed and is stuffed with too many characters. In addition to Electro, there is a perfunctory fight with the Green Goblin (including a wedged in back story) and a teaser squabble with a ridiculously mechanised 'Rhino' (Paul Giamatti, although it's hard to imagine any attempt to depict the Rhino character not looking ridiculous). The plot is a by-the-numbers superhero sketch with yet another energy-sucking threat that maybe can be stopped by feeding it too much energy (a threat/solution that's been around since at least 1953's 'The Magnetic Monster'). Typical for MCU opuses, the film is very uneven, swinging between sentimental melodrama and light-weight action-adventure, and even the tragic event in the final reel is granted no more the a few minutes of drama before Spidey is back to his signature gibes and one-liners. Most of the climactic battle is so drenched with flashing lights and shifting colour that it is hard to tell what is supposed to be happening and action sequences are filled with too many gimmicky (and clichéd) slow-mo and bullet-time shots. The film's unimpressive returns killed this iteration of the Wall-crawler (the second of three in a decade).",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
This is the best Spider man Movie I have ever seen,"I don't know why there are so much hate out there for this movie and why critics are not appreciating this movie as much the other spiderman movies. I personally and most of my friends think, this is by far the best Spiderman movie out there in the whole spiderman universe. The Character of Peter Parker is spot on. He's smart, witty and funny all at the same time. The romance between Peter and Gwen was spot on too. I loved all the action sequences in the movie. It is a fun ride. Its not a cry baby spiderman movie like the ones we have with the Toby McGuire series. I watched this movie twice the very same day and I felt the nostalgia of being a kid again watching a very uplifting superhero. All in all this movie deserves a far better rating and the industry should hold on from introducing another remake here. Let me and the audiences sink in with this one before we talk about the next.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
I wouldn't have believed it was this bad !,"Frankly, I was surprised by the first Amazing Spider-Man movie. It was refreshing and brought something new to the hero. But this one was not only unnecessary, it was a failure ! Of course I wouldn't have believed such a supposedly high-quality movie could be so bad, but it was indeed.-First, it is obviously a teenage oriented movie, because there's less blood than in a Disney one.-The story is messy and unfinished.-The characters are very cliché and too fake.-The electric special effects are retro and way too unrealistic.This movie gets a lot of things wrong, but it is still satisfying if you're looking for a classic blockbuster movie with an ordinary scenario...

THE AMAZING SPIDER MAN,"Electro isn't the best villain ever but he's still pretty interesting the film goes a bit all over the place but it's still entertaining and intelligent at times For me there is the best action of all the Spider man movies in this film. The story is not unbelievable but it's pretty good, it's not as bad as it sounds. What is really a pity is the story of the parents which is completely botched and which should have been explained in the first film unfortunately it was not done. The villain of electro is not developed enough and the idea that he is just crazy is a bit easy. Aunt May is not present enough in the film which is a shame, there is a lot of potential with this character.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"Too Many Cooks, Yet Again, Spoils the Broth!","Ah the Hollywood summer time starts and the next 3 months are lined up with some of the most anticipated movies of this year. Don't even get me started on the stars and budget of these flicks, everything seems marketed as the next best thing. From Bryan Cranston's Godzilla and Bryan Singer's X-Men Days of Future Past to Transformers Age of Extinction and Dawn Of Planet of The Apes and then some more. Apparently a separate budget needs to be planned for the same, cutting back some of em. A tough choice indeed.While Sony's decision to reboot Sam Raimi's Spider-Man franchise could be best tagged 'hasty', The Amazing Spider-man garnered enough attention and good critiques that they even green lit its 3rd and 4th sequels, all thanks to Andrew Garfield's portrayal of a 'better' Peter Parker and Marc Webb's direction. Frankly I am a fan of Sam Raimi's original trilogy and as opposed by many, I liked Tobey Maguire's Peter Parker more and maybe . But seems like Garfield's Peter Parker has grown on me and although I initially hated The Amazing Spider-man, I couldn't let go a Spider-man sequel. Just like Marvel's movies, I was bound to watch this and I did in all its splendor in IMAX. I so sorely wanted to add "".and boy, I loved it"" but unfortunately it neither had the charm nor the oomph I'd anticipated for.To start things off, we're shown the unfortunate demise of Peter's parents and the movie revolves around the the mysteries involved with the same. But it gets lost amidst Peter and Gwen's mushy romance. I appreciate Marc Webb's expertise with handling romance, as evident from 500 Days of Summer, but it also felt like too much time had been allotted for Peter and Gwen's goofy on and off relationship. It worked well in the comics but on celluloid it felt gratuitous and cheesy. And now let's discuss villains, shall we? What's with Sony and squeezing as much villains as possible in a spidey movie? Don't they know that saying 'Too many cooks spoil the broth or haven't they learnt anything from Spider-man 3? As obvious from the tag 'Rise of Electro', The Amazing Spider-Man 2's main villain is Electro and he would have sufficed for a good movie. But No, Sony just had to squeeze in Green Goblin and Rhino as well, even if it means mere minutes of them. Of the lot, Electro was impressive and tells us to stay away from obsessive 'nobody' like Max Dillon. And by the time he 'rises' to power his fickle-mindness can only matched with his ego and obsession. The Times Square scene in particular was tense, Electro felt like a bomb about to explode and spidey had to play all the right strings to keep him calm.Andrew Garlfield once again dons the Spider-man spandex suit and is bit less annoying than the first. Then again he never felt even remotely threatened by adversaries and on the other hand he seemed more worried and preoccupied with his relationship with Gwen. Weirdly, his performance felt better when he was suited up than not. Emma Stone is a brilliant actor but even she was like this adrenaline junkie who couldn't stay away from Spidey and the antagonists and in the end she just becomes a damsel in distress than anything. Jamie Foxx showcased an electrifying performance as Electro (all puns intended) and even as Max, he was able to convincingly pull off his innocent yet obsessive shades. He was well intimidating as Electro, a worthy contender for Spider-man but thanks to inane script it was never fleshed out. Dane Dehaan is no stranger playing antagonist and does a fair job of playing Harry Osborn/Green Goblin and may even slide into being a formidable villain in the upcoming sequels. Oh and by the way, Paul Giamatti plays Aleksei Sytsevich, a thug-turned-Rhino with a weird Russian which is best left at that.The Amazing Spider-man is surely dark and the weird injection of comedy was another nuance I found. Agreed, Spidey is meant to be a wisecracking superhero, but no superhero would be wisecracking if his or the one he loves' life is at stake, it makes the sequence less tense. And talk about 'being dark', the bodycounts were enormous this time and i can only imagine how much would have been at stake on the Time Square and highway stunts, yet the narrative just goes on not even addressing the grim things that just happened, crowds cheered, people went about their daily lives as if there was absolutely no threat in the horizon.The movie clocks in at a runtime of 142 minutes so good luck if you have a weak bladder. Despite the long runtime it becomes victim to some flimsily edited sequences. Action sequences were abruptly put to stop and there were some transitions where it felt like ""Did the film reel just do a backflip?"" Felicia Hardy makes a cameo and could be, hopefully, seen as Black Cat later on in the franchise. The same goes for the excellent end-credit sequence that kept us guessing, leading to speculations of the The Sinister Six.The score from Hans Zimmer and Pharell Williams upped the ante a bit this time able to give that much needed soul which the first lacked. And thanks to the same, Spider-man swinging by gave me goosebumps. I guess its in every fanboy's wishlist to do so and to watch it live in all the IMAX glory, it was nothing short of spectacular.Marc Webb is undoubtedly a skilled director but with no guidance from Marvel I guess he was just as lost as we were. Its time for Marvel to buy back its most beloved character. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 falls into the familiar mediocre territory that its predecessor fell into.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

"While certainly one of the weaker films based on the wall-crawler, and with its share of flaws, ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is able to pull through.  A very decent sequel.","Marc Webb's ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" is one of those movies that was destined to conjure up mixed reception from critics and fans. The key ingredients are all there. But it just doesn't quite gel together as it did in the prior film, and certainly not as well as it did to the prior film trilogy that Webb's movies serve as a reboot of. (The Sam Raimi trilogy of 2002-2007) But even when it doesn't gel together perfectly, this film is able to salvage itself and elevate itself beyond its flaws thanks to its abundant strengths.Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) is at an uncertain time of his life. Struggling with his feelings for girlfriend Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone), while still feeling guilt over her father's death, we see him going through the stages of make-ups and break-ups repeatedly, as he is worried his dual-life as Spider-Man could hurt her. At the same time, he attempts to re-connect with his childhood friend Harry Osbourne (Dane DeHaan), who is going through a troubled time in his life after inheriting Oscorp from his late father. These matters are made even more complex by the arrival of a new villain- Electro (Jamie Foxx), a troubled and socially awkward man suffering an unhealthy obsession with Spider-Man who is transformed by a tragic accident into a powerful being made of electricity.The film has been highly criticized by many, and I will say it is with good reason. The trouble really all comes back to the script by Roberto Ocri, Alex Kurtzman and Jeff Pinkner. (With addition contributions to the story by James Vanderbilt) This movie is one of the most over- complex and over-stuffed juggling acts I've seen since, well... 2007's ""Spider-Man 3"", which yielded some similar criticism. Too much is happening in the film, causing a lot of development to go out the window. Key plot lines (of which there are many) often only have 2-3 scenes devoted to development and resolution, and it's not very satisfying. It also doesn't help that it feels like a large amount of content was cut from the film for pacing reasons. It feels like there's a lot missing here. I also think our writing team made some bold but foolish choices with how some of the plot-lines and characters are developed, and how, well, cartoonish some sequences come across. I hate to say it, but the writing sucks.HOWEVER, the film is able to save itself from completely imploding from the poor writing. Yes, the film is salvaged and actually made decent and entertaining thanks to the wonderful cast, fantastic direction, competent production and top-notch visuals and action. I've always firmly believed that a flawed script isn't a death sentence... if the rest of the production is strong, weak writing can be forgiven. And this is a case of just that.This cast is just plain magical. Garfield really is in his element here. I wasn't a huge fan of his performance in the prior film, but here he absolutely shines. Stone is just lovely in her portrayal of Gwen, making her so likable and so human, you'll fall in love with her almost as much as Peter has. Jamie Foxx is a lot of fun as Electro, making him tragic (albeit not necessarily in a likable way, but in a way that you can pity him) and also quite intimidating. Dane DeHaan is perfectly cast as Osbourne, giving him a lot of depth and pain, yet also a faint glimmer of light and hope inside. And supporting roles by the likes of Chris Cooper, Sally Field and Paul Giamatti are just so much fun and very well-played.Marc Webb's direction is also a huge step-up. His visual storytelling is so slick and pitch-perfect for this sort of material. I wasn't sure about his earlier work, as I wasn't too impressed by ""(500) Days of Summer"", but here he shows how capable he is with handling a variety of material- from the pure emotional to the intensely action-packed. I have to say, he has particularly grown in how he directs his action, as I believe this film probably has some of the best action out of all five ""Spider-Man"" features released during the past 12 years.The rest of the production is top-notch. The cinematography is absolutely beautiful and even awe-inspiring at times. The set design is great. The costume design wonderful. (I wasn't sure about the new Spider-Man outfit, but it totally works on-screen) Hans Zimmer's score is a good match for the material. (And thankfully, this is probably Hans Zimmer's least ""Hans-Zimmer-sounding"" score.) And the visual effects are among the best I've seen this year.I also have to comment on the 3D. I'm not a huge 3D fan. For me, it's a take-it-or-leave-it gimmick. I don't care whether or not I see a film in 3D. But this is definitely one film I'm glad I saw in 3D. While dialog and plot scenes don't benefit much from the added depth, the action sequences certainly do. During the action and web-slinging sequences, I actually felt like I was swinging along with Spider-Man, and I got that same lovely light feeling in my chest, belly and head that roller-coasters me. Easily one of the best 3D viewing experiences I've had.I do think that the script unfortunately bogs the film down, and sadly makes it arguably the most flawed entry in the franchise. (And probably the second-weakest after ""Spider-Man 3"") But I cannot deny how strong all other aspects of this production are. The weak script is mostly forgivable thanks to the other elements at play.I am giving ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2"" a slightly above average 6 out of 10. It's very flawed, but still quite entertaining. This is a web-swing of fun that is still worth taking for some fans.",6.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"""When Is This Movie Over?""","I brought my son last night with anticipation of a blockbuster follow up. Sadly this movie dragged on full of story line that robbed itself of dynamic flow an action paced film requires.We've seen books turn into movies. This movie felt like a movie turned into a paperback book. The scenes had too much dialog in where redundancy of its context turned this action into more of a soap opera. I found myself having to keep myself optimistic that the movie will progress.Without having to give spoiler alerts, the scenes that had action were more of a show of graphics horsepower than brilliance in storyline. The villain(s) roles were poorly written in a way that was haphazard, untrue to the purists, and as if this will be the last Spider-Man installment. I say this because it seemed as they ran out of money/time or just didn't care to take attention to detail. If it weren't for my son wanting to see this movie, I wouldn't mind leaving. Thankfully Emma Stone kept me intrigued. Otherwise I would have been searching for a pillow.The Amazing Spider-Man franchise has done a poor job in transitioning away from its comic book aesthetic the way the Batman franchise did into the Darkknight franchise. Bottom-line I still prefer the original Spider-Man franchise because it was the best written and produced. How can they make this up to me? Well they kind of blew it with the villain aspect.

The best yet !,"The Amazing Spiderman 2 is truly a masterpiece of a movie in an era where it is so competitive in creating a good superhero movie... The Amazing Spider-man 2 blows them all away with ease.Very few films, actors and stories get you completely engrossed to the point where you feel as though you live in their world, but Andrew Garfield, Emma Stone and the rest of the cast do it perfectly.Sam Riami's Predeceasing films were good but this Spidey is 'Amazing' and it is not for what you might think. Yes the cgi and special effects are better simply for the development of technology over time. However, It is how close knit to the original Spidey these films are keeping which is so impressive.Andrew Garfields portrayal is exceptional, he has completely made the role his own, some when I speak of Spider-man will now say, 'Toby Who?' His general look in the costume is much more realistic and his humour is beyond question, brilliant. He really is 'just a normal guy' as he claimed his the first instalment saving a kid from a dangling car inferno.The Plot is twisting and turning throughout with something always going on and when there is a non-action period, the story is so enthralling we don't even notice.With emotion, love, Undeynably excellent action sequences, Depth, and Character to both Amazing Spider-man films to date, a Spidey world has been created that I never want to leave.They have a chance here to do something really special, not just 3 films say, but more like a series of 7 or 8 or 9 films (Im thinking Star Wars, Harry Potter Style) and confidently stick with Garfield. Let his character of Spiderman grow as he does over a period of years to come. It could become arguably one of the greatest film sets of all time from one of the most famous and iconic fictional figures of all time.To sum up all iv'e said:Sheer Brilliance.",10.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
Muddled Plot and Awkward Dialogue,"First, let me just say that the first 20 minutes of this film are fantastic. We finally get to see the Spider-Man from the comics that not one single movie of either trilogy has shown. I loved that. Then the film went South in a hurry.The next hour is spent introducing characters, and not in a very convincing way, I might add. Why so much time spent on introductions? Because this movie has more plot lines than spider web has geometric shapes. The plot is so muddled with so many different things and there is nothing tying them all together. There is no central theme, nothing for me as the viewer to grasp on to to carry me from one end of the film to the other. It's really a mess.The other thing that turned me off was the awkward dialogue. It was poorly introduced and unconvincingly written. For example, there is absolutely no time spent developing the relationship between Peter Parker and Aunt May, but all of a sudden in the middle of the film there's this big emotional breakthrough which is meaningless because it hasn't been set up properly. And many of the exchanges had me putting my face in my hands and groaning.What's the one redeeming quality of the film? The web slinging. It was the best of any Spider-Man film to date.",5.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
"The ""Almost there"" Spiderman","While watching ""The Amazing Spiderman 2"" it is very clear why Marc Webb was given the reigns as director. When it comes to the emotional core of the story and getting performances to match those many emotions in the film he does a hell of a job. The romance between Gwen and Peter is much more believable and real than Peter and Mary Jane's in Sam Raimi's trilogy. If only the rest of the film had the precision that the love story does this film would have been a home run.The film falls somewhere in the middle of something amazing and a missed opportunity. It never does get to the lows of some of the most terrible comic book movies like ""Batman and Robin"". What is most frustrating about it is that there is greatness hidden in such a bloated film where the misses outshine the hits. The first part of the movie where we are shown how comfortable Peter has fit into his role as the hero of the city while trying juggle his feelings and guilt about Gwen and the broken promise he failed to keep with her dad is where the film shines. This goes beyond Garfield and Stone being a real couple. There have been plenty of films where the two leads were a real life item but the chemistry failed to translate to the screen. Garfield and Stone are perfect for each other in this movie. They bounce off each other perfectly with all the romance and flirtatious dialogue they are given. While the romance is the strongest aspect of the film it does crutch on a bit too much at times, which in results in it being a bit too cutsey. That said, all the rest of the relationships are quite well done. Aunt May, played by Sally Field, is still a great emotional center for Peter. She provides Peter with what Uncle Ben did before he was killed. The characters growth is sold through Field's acting ability and some interesting plot points. In this film we meet the famed comic book villain Harry Osborn, who eventually becomes The Green Goblin. Even though Harry and Peter's relationship origin has been changed and is a bit underwritten; Dane DeHaan and Garfield do give off the vibe they were friends separated by life's obstacles. DeHann is sinister, cold, and a bit frightening with the limited screen time he has. It is going to be interesting what he brings us next time with more screen time.That screen time is given to Max Dillion and is one of the mistakes the movie commits. Where Harry's story is full intrigue, important to Peter's life, and had the potential to be something really great, we are given an extremely clichéd and underwritten backstory to why Dillion turns evil when he becomes Electro. Where Harry feels like he could have been a great fleshed out character, Electro feels like a secondary villain. Foxx does his best, and he is good, but the character is very underwritten and seems to have no other purpose than to showcase the effects in the movie.Andrew Garfield's confidence in this film has grown. He captures both the awkwardness and heroism that Spiderman/Peter Parker possesses. When he has that mask on he is a man that so many place their hope in for a better city. This point is nicely done at first but kind of gets overly dramatic towards the end. One thing that Garfield is great at is the legendary Spiderman wise cracks. His sarcasm and wit are so sharp when it needs to be. This is mainly because you can see Garfield loves playing the role. The bar has been set by Andrew for future actors of the role.One thing I will give Webb is that it seems he embraces the fun of Spiderman this time around. Where the 2012 film was a tad serious, this one embraces the spirit of Spiderman and the fun it is to be him. Even the suit has lost the out of place dark eyes and replaced them with the iconic large white eyes. The colors of the film are more vibrant, especially when it comes to Electro's screen time. When combined with Garfield's spirit it creates a light hearted superhero film that has seemed to be lost and looked down upon ever since Christopher Nolan's ""The Dark Knight"" franchise. Several points in this film will bring a slight smile to the most jaded comic book movie fans. There are times though the choice of making it lighter does backfire. Some scenes or lines come off way too corny or feel like they belong in a bad 90's comic book film.For the most part though, Webb understands the balance between fun and serious. His ambitious nature does hurt the film a bit. Where some parts of the are extremely well done and you want to see them expanded, the amount of material stuffed into this film prevents that from happening. The first time Webb had to search for his own identity and found it in this film. Maybe next time he will learn to trim the fat because underneath this good film is something truly amazing. Hopefully next time we will get to see that.",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi

A tried and tested formula film that will deliver gold at box office.,"The sequel to Amazing Spider-Man is a tried and tested formula film that will deliver gold at box office. Other than raking big bucks, it has its share of weaknesses and good points but there is nothing 'amazing' about it as such.Spider-Man continues his struggle with himself, his life (love and otherwise), conclusions, and pretty much everything a normal adults does. This makes him a superhero everyone identifies with easily (perhaps the reason there is never an apparent overdose of Spidey).Strong points of the film: Emma Stone as Gwen Stacey: Emma is a vivacious actress who lights up the screen every time she enters the frame. Personally, she was the reason I actually decided to watch the first film when it clearly seemed unnecessary. The sequel has her carry on the good work; she and Andrew Garfield together, still sparkle. In fact she is what keeps Spidey grounded and thinking clearly. Without her guidance, we all know how confused our web-slinger gets.Supporting cast: primarily Dane DeHaan (Harry Osborne), Aunt May (Sally Field), and Paul Giamatti (Rhino) deliver strong performances, even though they had very minimal screen time to make any more impact. Osborne looked the right amount of ominous and can be looked forward to in upcoming films.The final 10 minutes: sum up everything a Spidey flick is all about, and energizes the audience. With no hope of deliverance, a kid picks up the mantle against an undeniable threat; Spidey gets over his slump and get back in the battle field.Other than these, Garfield does well as Spidey, the film starts off pretty well too, and there are some good laughs here and there. After a long time, got to chance enjoy an effects laden film in good old 2D, thoroughly enjoyed the 3D-less experience.Weak points of the film: Script is in complete disarray, and no matter how perky a chemistry Stacey-Garfield share, there is no salvation for a film scripted this poorly.Electro: Jamie Foxx simply...well, sucked—such a waste of potential. Rhino in his few minutes looked a much better villain.All in all a decent one time watch. You enjoy it and the same time wonder what is the need of continuing with the franchise.Upcoming film: Sinister Six have been given a sneak preview: Doctor Octopus, The Vulture, and Mysterio are more or less going to be unleashed. Rhino and Osborne look promising, others better be good because with Emma Stone (Gwen Stacey) departing from film there may be no saving grace for film, unless it is perfect.Post-credit: there is an X-Men: Days of Future Past scene that runs after the credits. It has a young William Stryker, Mystique, Toad, Spike, Ink, and Havoc. No apparent connection with Spider-man'a next film.7/10 P.S., of course, Stan Lee has a cameo!",7.0,Anonymous,Sci-Fi
