"Created a decade ago, but still stunning","I am a big fan of the animated movies coming from the Pixar Studios. They are always looking for the newest technological possibilities to use in their movies, creating movies that are more than just worth a watch, even when they were made a decade ago.The movie is about toys that come to life when their owner is asleep or not in the same room. When the young boy's birthday is coming up, all the toys are nervous. They don't want to be ignored when the new one arrives. Woody the cowboy is their ""leader"" because he's the most popular one of them all. He's the only one that hasn't got to be afraid, but than a new favorite arrives ... Buzz Lightyear. He hates him and tries everything possible to get rid of him, but as the time passes by they learn to appreciate each other...When you see Toy Story, you may think that the different human like characters (Woody the cowboy for instance) aren't always as perfect as we are used to see in todays animated movies. Perhaps that's true, but if you keep in mind that all this was done in 1995, when computers weren't yet as strong and the technology for creating such movies was almost unknown, than you can only have a lot of respect for what the creators did. I loved the story and liked the animations a lot. I give it an 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Plastic Fantastic.,"Y'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn't looking!In Andy's Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there's a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and ""plastic corrosion awareness meetings,"" until Andy's birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops ""in the field"" (downstairs watching Andy's gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels  in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature  just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the ""real people"") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.The ""Disney Movie"" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney's tyrannical umbrella overarches this film's production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney's craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar's first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.Sure, there are ""messages,"" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz's greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz's escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, ""Clearly I will go sailing no more,"" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy's family was Pixar's triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney's *idée fixe* of the 1950's nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.Buzz  who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy's favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of ""playing inert"" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it's instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz's ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as ""Mrs. Nesbitt""). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, ""This is not flying - this is falling with style,"" simply seals this movie's greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master's infallible toy filing system.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Proof that Pixar not only cares about the quality of their work,they care about our kids.","Though I am not a big fan of computer animation,I have to give the folks at Pixar credit.This brand of animation is nothing short of brilliant.The attention to detail,such as eye and body movement is quite remarkable.Computers allow them to make their characters as close to human like as possible,something we have never seen in traditional hand drawn animation,though the latter will always be the closest to my heart.Combine this excellence with a genuinely good story idea and a top notch voice cast and the result is good family entertainment.It's obvious that the people at Pixar are not only caring perfectionists when it comes to film making,but they care about our kids,something rarely seen today.Highly recommended for any home library.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Technically impressive with great script and sharp wit,"Andy's toys live a reasonable life of fun and peace, their only worries are birthdays and Christmases, when new toys could easily replace those already there.  One such birthday Andy's top toy, Woody the cowboy, finds himself in direct competition with Andy's new Buzz Lightyear doll.  When rivalries boil over Woody tries to hide Buzz down the side of the bed but accidentally pushes him out the window, the other tops expel Woody, and he leaves with no choice but to find Buzz and return him to the house.  But with only two days before Andy moves house, time is of the essence.Given how often the same mix of animation, wit, jokes and kids humour has been used since Toy Story (Ice Age, Monsters Inc, Bugs Life) it is easy to forget how refreshing it was when it first came out.  I have just watched it again and it is dating a little in comparison to more recent twists on the formula.  It seems each one has to be sharper and have more references etc in the background.  However it is still very funny and deserves praise for being the first of a successful formula.The plot is simple but effective and actually has genuine drama and excitement to it.  The main story is fun but the degree of character development is what really shores it up.  The conflict between Buzz and Woody is taken deeper than this and, when confronted by the truth of his status as a toy, Buzz's turmoil is very real as opposed to him being a cartoon character and nothing more.  Despite the two strong leads there is a real depth in the support cast.  They may not actually have that many lines, but they have all the funniest lines.  Most of the `adult' wit comes from the Potato Head, dinosaur, the pig and slinky dog.  They are funny and are very well used.  In fact the majority of this humour and plot will go right over kids heads.Looking back on it, I do feel a cynical edge on it in so much as this film must really have helped sales of the toy companies in the film.  It's hard not to see the marketing department standing behind this film rubbing their hands.  However the actual product is so wonderfully fun that I forgot this quickly.  The voice work is excellent and the characters match the actors. Hanks is good as Woody and Allen has a good B-movie type voice for Buzz. Varney, Ratzenberger, Ermey (doing his usual), Rickles and others are all really good in the support roles and, probably, come out as the favourite characters for adults.Overall this is a classic film that will appeal to adults as much as to kids (if not more).  A good plot and a really sharp script make the already short running time fly by.  The only downside is that your kids will want you to go out and buy the damn things!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Excellent Viewing, Every Time!","This is a very clever animated story that was a big hit, and justifiably so. It had a terrific sequel and if a third film came out, that would probably be a hit, too.When this came out, computer technology just was beginning to strut its stuff. Man, this looked awesome. Now, it's routine because animation, which took a giant leap with this movie, has made a lot more giant strides.The humor in here, however, is what made this so popular. There are tons of funny lines, issued by characters voiced by Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Jim Varney, Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn and John Ratzenberger, among others. As good as Hanks is as ""Woody"" and Allen as ""Buzz Armstrong,"" I think the supporting characters just about stole the show: Mr. Potato Head, Slinky, Rex the dinosaur, etc.Multiple viewings don't diminish the entertainment, either. There are so many things to catch, audibly and visually, that you always seem to discover something new. The colors in here are beautiful, too. This is a guaranteed ""winner"" as is the sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Best Disney film. Ever.,"Toy Story is not only the best Disney film because it has the best story and the best animation, but also because of the excellent actors chosen to provide the voices of the animals. The casting was perfect from top to bottom, and the movie provides an excellent adventure story about friendship and loyalty that keeps you engrossed until the nail-biting climax.Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provided excellent voices for Woody and Buzz Lightyear -their performances alone are one of the biggest things that made this such a spectacular movie. Besides that, though, you have the excellent story that is not only noteworthy because it has never really been told from this perspective before, but also because it was just told so well. All of the characters in the film are very well developed and all have appropriate and effective actors chosen to provide their voices.And of course, who could forget the revolutionary animation! The computer animation used for this movie not only made it startlingly realistic but also opened up tons of possibilities, and thankfully the filmmakers chose to explore these possibilities. There are dozens of things that are hidden in the woodwork throughout the film, as well as in the songs  note, for example, the subtle playing of the Indiana Jones theme song in the scene where Woody knocks Buzz out the window with the desk lamp.Toy Story is by far the best Disney film ever made, it's pretty much perfect. It's adventurous, it's exciting, it's entertaining, it's good for the whole family, it's got great characters, story, and plot, and above all, it's fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Every Kid's Fantasy,"Toy Story is the film that started Pixar Animated Studios into its long string of never ending success. What Pixar does is not just absorb the younger demographic and keep the older ones mildly entertained. It completely absorbs everyone watching no matter the age or the level of maturity, films of Pixar, starting from Toy Story, have kept a certain magical touch around it with an unexpected amount of depth. Everyone as a child imagines their toys will come alive and go on their own adventures. One of the great things Pixar does is that it does not attract audiences with its overloaded superstar casts but rather with its material. The only superstar here is Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is the next most aforementioned voice over. Unlike what most people think their is an actually a method to casting for animated films as there is to a live-action one. As a result of this Pixar stays faithful to its material and creates a great genuine and warm feeling around the film and its characters.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"""Toy Story"" - The Toys are in town and something more","I'm 19, going on 20 in six days. I don't need to tell you that ""Toy Story"" is a movie tailor-made for the kiddies, but there's a special reservation for adults too. I should know, as should anyone who views it with an open mind. We've all had our favorite toys. For guys, like me, there's a 90% chance you played with either Transformers or G.I. Joe or Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or all three when you were six, seven, eight, or nine years-old. For me, it was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Godzilla action figures. I'd always imagine living out wild fantasy adventures in my room or basement; ah, the joy of being a kid again. But that's part of ""Toy Story's"" fun appeal. It gives you a chance to relive your childhood again. Today I saw for the first time in about eight years and it's still just as fresh and inventive as Pixar, probably the best film studio in computer animation, conceived it back in 1995. In the room of young Andy, the toys are alive - when he's not present of course, and cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) is the boy's favorite item. But all that changes on Andy's birthday and a new toy given to him on that day captures the boy's heart - Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen). Of course, any replacement of this sort inspires jealousy, and pretty soon Buzz is the new ""it"" item of the bedroom. Andy's given into everything Buzz Lightyear, even new bedsheets - bedsheets! - leaving poor Woody on the short end of the stick. But the thing is, Buzz has trouble believing he's just a simple toy and nothing more, as he thinks he's actually BUZZ LIGHTYEAR! It also seems this couldn't have come at a worse time for the toys, as Andy and his mother are moving away, which is causing all sorts of chaos as Woody tries to get everything organized so nobody is left behind, and that's exactly what happens with rivals Woody and Buzz, who are misplaced and must find their beloved Andy before they move. Not only that, they must also battle Sid, the serial killer in-training kid that lives next door and tortures toys. As directed by John Lasseter and his army of screenwriters including himself, Andrew Stanton (who would co-direct Pixar's future hit ""Finding Nemo"" in 2003) and Joel Cohen, ""Toy Story"" is true imaginative fantasy realized in superb animation. It more than brings the kid in you to the surface, it makes you want to be a kid again, as many toys have cameos including Army Men (including the Sergeant who's voiced by R. Lee Ermey) and Mr. Potato Head (voiced by Don Rickles). I love ""Toy Story,"" and I think anyone who views it thoughtfully will love it too.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The World Of Andy's Room,"Just in case you were also wondering what happened to all the toys that went missing when you were a kid, the answer is clear: They escaped.""Toy Story"" is the kind of children's movie adults can enjoy just as much, because it very cleverly mines deep deposits of nostalgia from the memory banks. That may be the reason the 1990s bedroom of young Andy is populated by playthings of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. If Andy was a real boy of his time, there would be a computer and a TV/Nintendo, and not much else.The voicings of the various toys add to the enjoyability. Tom Hanks was the biggest star of the moment when ""Toy Story"" came out, and he works with that likeability by creating a stable center as Woody the cowboy doll. Don Rickles has the screen role of his career (not that ""Kelly's Heroes"" was Oscar material) as a prickly Mr. Potato Head, while Jim Varney and R. Lee Ermey are standouts in the supporting cast.Tim Allen gives the movie's best performance, as a newfangled toy that takes Woody's place in Andy's heart but can't bring himself to accept that he's just a plastic plaything. It's the role of the story that gives him the best lines (""I don't believe that man has ever been to medical school""), but Allen delivers them with real panache. He more than holds his own, and you kind of see where he took off with that note-perfect William Shatner parody he perfected on screen in the underrated ""Galaxy Quest.""While this movie's use of computer animation makes it a milestone, it neither represents the most innovative use of the technology or the cleverest Pixar-ated treatment of a story. ""A Bug's Life"" seems a more worthy apex; that story was funnier, worked better on its own merits, and used the animation to better effect. But given how novel all of this was in 1995, ""Toy Story"" could have been a lot less thought-through than it was, and still made gobs of money. The fact it is instead invested with real heart, and can be watched and enjoyed today just as easily as when it debuted nearly 10 years ago, is a tribute to the people behind it.I like Randy Newman's music, just not here, and while the animation textures are surprisingly lifelike, there are places, especially with Scud the dog but also with the baby's drool, where it falls short. The story itself gets kind of rote with repeat viewings, though the transition to Sid's bedroom and its sad mutilated toys is a genius moment. So too are the vending machine aliens, who gape in rapt wonder at the judgment of ""the claw."" If it reached for pathos a little less often, ""Toy Story"" would be an undeniable classic.As it is, it is very, very good, the kind of film that's only good for children, even (especially?) the inner ones.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The best film for small children....,"My toddler has been watching this film for about 3 months, and I'm not sick of it and neither is she.

As Good as It Gets!,"What a wonderful integration of classic toys and a superb plot. It's a new height in animation (though things have gotten even more impressive long since). The voicings of Tim Allen as Buzz and Tom Hanks as Woody, with their inherent connection to their toy beings, with an incredible supporting cast, make this a romp to end all romps. There is a strain between the realities of the world and the fact that even though they are sentient beings, they are still toys. Buzz has lights that flash but he can't really fly. Woody has the ludicrous string on his back that allows him to deliver his catch phrases. Then there is the neighborhood villain, Sid, who is a maimer and destroyer of toys. There is the quest for the mishandled and lost. And a finale that is worthy of everything that has been set up. What really makes this work is the ""humanity"" of the characters. There is love and a true connection among them. If you have never seen this, it is worth every minute.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story: Thoroughly Entertaining,"With the ever increasing proximity of Toy Story 3, I decided it was about time for me to revisit the original and its first sequel to refresh my memory. Having been among the original target audience, it's a real trip back to childhood.The longtime favourite toy of young Andy, Woody is disgruntled to be pushed aside in favour of a new space-ranger action figure in the form of Buzz Lightyear. Admired by child and fellow toys alike, Buzz threatens Woody's territory, prompting an effort to remove him which results in the two being left many miles from home, with little time to get back before the family's move.Now regarded fondly as one of the best kids' movies of all time, Toy Story was the catalyst which allowed Pixar to rapidly ascend to the throne of animation where they dominantly remain to this day. Certainly it wowed me when I first saw it, almost fifteen years ago now. Indulging every child's fantasy that their toys come to life when they're not looking, we find ourselves instantly aligned with the host of strange characters. The quality of the animation, revolutionary for its time, is seen instantly, proudly boasted in the movements of the soldiers as they march downstairs. Everything looks completely realistic and, most importantly, believable. Whilst amusing beforehand, the laughs only really start to build up when Buzz arrives and we are treated to his interactions with Woody, the disagreements between the two and their petty arguments forming the basis of the film's funny factor. The added maturity of years affords the understanding of some of the film's more adult jokes, adding a little something extra to the experience for returning viewers. The action-adventure side of the plot keeps up the drama, tension, and sense of doom, keeping us wondering whether or not the reluctant duo will ever make it back in time. The scenes in Sid's house are the film's best, in terms of keeping up suspense. Their oddness is stand-out and ever memorable, the stranger toys therein encountered doubtlessly having haunted many little 'uns over the years. Certainly still enjoyable, Toy Story remains an inherently good film, though for me it stands less high than the likes of Wall-E, lacking the considerable emotional impact of that later Pixar effort.Carrying a vast legacy, Toy Story stands the test of time well, still as enjoyable as ever it was. Having paved the way for films which, as you would hope, took what it did and did them better, it is enduring, endearing, and thoroughly entertaining.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (""I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout"").

Toy Story,"Toy Story was directed & written by John Lasseter, being his, and Pixar's first major production. Toy Story was originated by John Lasseter himself, Joe Ranft, who wrote The Lion King & Beauty and the Beast, and the start of the iconic Pete Docter & Andrew Stanton as well.Toy Story broke so many barriers, creating the first full-length motion picture about toys, when we're not around, while giving them humanized traits, and problems, (I knew I wasn't the only one who used to think about my toys when I wasn't around, as a kid). It's almost impossible not to praise this film, being one of a few films 100% critically acclaimed on Rotten Tomatoes. Toy Story was an inventive family-film, created twenty-five years ago, and other then some mediocre animations, the film still holds up tremendously til this day! It is beautifully paced, while having high risks at all times.Before I jump into these amazing characters, I want to give credit to Janet Hirshen, Mike Fenton, Jane Jenkins & Ruth Lambert, for casting the absolute best voice over cast, someone could've ever put together. Sheriff Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, was the clear cut leader of the toys. Woody is the smartest of the group, stealing every scene he's in, with tremendous character development. Buzz Lightyear, voiced by Tim Allen, was a super enjoyable character, adding this toy personality, compared to everyone else's humanized personalities. Buzz complimented Woody very well throughout the whole film, creating a decent share of the risks. Rex, voiced by Wallace Shawn, was almost indefinitely the best character in the film. He is by far the funniest of the group, adding an unexpected twist to his personality. Mr. Potato Head, voiced by Don Rickles, acted as the dad character, with such a negative attitude, that clashed brilliantly with everyone. Hamm, voiced by John Ratzenberger, was one of the smartest of the pack, being very blunt, and right to the point. Slinky Dog, voiced by Jim Varney, was Woody's right hand man, being the most matured toy of the group. Our antagonist in Sid, is just as diabolical as the Joker, Thanos, & Scar. He is so dark and creepy, and poses a huge traumatic threat to any toy in the area, or in his possession.The screenplay by Andrew Stanton, Joe Ranft, Bud Luckey, Pete Docter, Joss Whedon, Joel Cohen & Alec Sokolow, was so pleasing for the kids and the adults, sneaking in their fair share of adult jokes. It captured so many heartfelt moments, ultimately hitting home when the film concludes.Toy Story was the first beautiful full length CG animated film! For 1995, these animations were essentially flawless! The production designers in Patsy Bouge & Karen Robert Jackson, created these brilliant sets & set pieces, with amazing sizeable shots, to give great depth, and life to everything.The score & music by Randy Newman worked phenomenally with the story. Not only was You Got a Friend in Me, a smash hit, but Strange Things Are Happening To Me, as well.Overall, even though this film had very minuscule nitpicks, with the editing, and some circumstances, it was still almost flawless!

Even after 25 years this is still a magical film,"I re-watched this for the first time in about 15 years and it still holds up remarkably well. The animation is still very expressive at capturing character, tone and making a believable world unto itself. Pixar would go on to create more polished films but this one has all the hallmarks of the company. The story is enjoyable for children and if parents squint they can see a metaphor in employment turnover. (Not to mention the cultural transition from westerns to sci-fi, or the meta irony of 2d cell animation being supplanted by CGI). The film is equal parts charming, funny and exciting.

Infinity and beyond from Disney and Pixar!,"Disney and Pixar studios team up and brought us an imaginative adventure story about a little boy named Andy who loves playing with his toys, with his best friend being a cowboy doll named Woody. However, when Andy and not body else is looking, the toys come to life. Woody is the leader of the toys in Andy's room, which include a Mr. Potato Head, Slinky the Dog, Rex the Dinosaur, Hamm the Pig and Bo-Peep the girl doll. However, when Andy's get new toy space ranger Buzz Lightyear for his birthday, Buzz takes the place of Woody of being leader of the toys and Andy's new best friend. Brewing with jealously, Woody attempts to get rid of Buzz, but both ended up lost outside of Andy's house. As a result, they must find their way back to Andy's house before they move - first trying to get through Andy's weird neighbor and toy torturer Sid.This is filmed in brilliant and colorful computer animation - very detailed and realistic. The story is full of surprises and adventure, from Woody and Buzz getting lost in a pizza shop to them trying to break loose out of Sid's house to get back to Andy's. The movie is also filled with comedy; you will have to watch the movie to appreciate and understand the humor only live toys could make. And, there are toe-tapping songs you would learn to love including Randy Newman's opening song ""You've Got a Friend in Me."" While this movie's plot is full of non-stop fun and adventure, making every moment exciting and entertaining, the film also concentrates on friendship and teamwork and overcoming all odds. While I mostly enjoyed this movie, I wished that Woody was not made out to be hated on so much by the other toys after Woody's jealous behavior towards Buzz. I thought this takes away at Woody's hero status too much especially for his first movie.But overall, this is one of Disney's best work, which will make you suspend your disbelief and expand your imagination. Also, hands down to a great voice cast: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Annie Potts and Jim Varney.Grade B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Just missing that extra something,"This first entirely computer animated film by Disney is a pretty good effort, but the film seems lacks that extra something, that makes it good. The action, which does not seem to stop is only' pretty thrilling and the film overall is only' kind of funny (I didn't burst out with laughter once). Therefore this film can not achieve the rating good (8 out of 10) by me, for a good film (in my opinion) is good on more than just one or two levels and it has to cover the entire film (preferably exceeding in more than one genre). Nonetheless this is (again) no disappointment by Disney.7 out of 10 (an average rating for a Disney animated feature)",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Horrible message,"I was well prepared to like this movie on the basis of the art alone, and the art did not disappoint.  However, I found much of the humor to be based on cruelty, and I was truly horrified by the overall message of the film: ""Lower your expectations for yourself and everything will work out fine."" It reminded me of The Breakfast Club, whose main theme seemed to be ""Conform to the style of the popular kids, and all your problems will dissipate."" This is just so wrong.  If you want to see really good computer animation that will amuse you, inspire your children to be good and strong and true, and which predates this  shallow and uninspiring vehicle, check out the television series Reboot, now being re-run on Cartoon Network.

Only to start, the story: The toys have life of their own, and every time we humans are distant from them, they have their lives and their own plans. Woody, until Buzz LightYear comes up,was Andy's favorite toy and also the leader of all of them.

Four Dimensional Toybox,"I see that my previous comment on this film was deleted.This is the thing that started it all: Pixar. Somewhat photorealistic modeling. Deep, deep attention to story dynamics. An animated feature not so polished since ""Snow White."" Something worthy. Something that led to the reinvention of Disney.Its an iconic turning point, like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""2001,"" ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" Greenaway's ""Tempest."" (and others) Many things after change.So it should be seen on its historical basis alone. Here already you can see that Pixar decides to combine goals. They want the movie to be just as good as the best non- animated movie. There is the well-documented attention to refining and refining the story dynamics so that the narrative spine simply works. That took years.What I mean by combined goals is that they also realized that they were presenting something relatively new in their three D modeling capability. So they wanted to have that new cinematic vocabulary enhance the narrative dynamics and vice versa. It is subtle here, not fully developed until ""Nemo."" But its plain to see when pointed out: the camera simply moves in ways that a real one does not. There are a broader set of intimate and distanced observer perspectives. These are not overused, lest you notice them, but you can see that out tolerance and viewing skill has slowly evolved from this to the later Pixar projects.

Reminds me of my childhood,I watched Toy story when I was little and it was my favorite childhood movie and I really love it because it made me think a lot and when I was little I used to tip toe up the steps and down the hall and peek into my room to see if my toys were moving but they never were but I just thought they were really good and I used to talk to them all the time about my life which you will most likely think I'm weird because I talked to my toys but I talked to my dog to and you want to know why well because I love to talked and everybody was annoyed so I just talked to my stuff.

A timeless journey of friendship and imagination,"""Toy Story,"" directed by John Lasseter, is a groundbreaking animated film that marked the beginning of Pixar's illustrious journey. Released in 1995, this beloved classic explores the secret life of toys, centering on the rivalry and eventual friendship between Woody, a cowboy doll voiced by Tom Hanks, and Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger action figure voiced by Tim Allen.The film's innovative use of computer-generated animation was revolutionary at the time and still holds up remarkably well. The characters are brought to life with vibrant detail and expressive personalities, making them relatable and endearing to audiences of all ages.The story delves into themes of loyalty, jealousy, and acceptance, presenting a heartfelt narrative that resonates on multiple levels. The voice performances are exceptional, with Hanks and Allen delivering standout roles that have become iconic in animation history.While ""Toy Story"" is undeniably charming and entertaining, some might find the plot straightforward compared to the deeper narratives of its sequels. Nonetheless, its humor, creativity, and emotional depth make it a timeless classic.

Cornerstone cinema,"In many ways Toy Story is just as big of a film as Snow White, or My Neighbor Totoro. It is the first of its kind, really. The very first feature-length computer-animated film and the founding stone of Pixar Studios. And quite like Snow White, it is still a marvelous film. With certain, minor caveats.First the praise. The story is still incredible. It has to be for the film to have withstood the test of time so well. It is about toys coming to life when humans are away at least partly because toys were much easier to animate than real humans (the humans in this film look scary, by the way), but great storytelling is often inspired by limitations. And that certainly applies here. Through simple childhood toys we explore the concepts of growing up, learning new things, meeting new people, dealing with failed expectations, fear of loss, abandonment and betrayal, letting go of things, and most importantly, about friendship and family. And it's all told through a fetching, relatable and kid-friendly narrative.The characters are also a lot of fun, though as a kid I never realized what a jerk Woody (Tom Hanks) really is. Sure, that's his point, but I always though that the cowboy had something of a point. Perhaps kids see these things differently. And nevertheless, the idea that Woody was in the wrong was clear even back then.Unfortunately what hasn't aged so well is the animation. The humans look terrible, yes, but that was clear even in 1995. But the toys were phenomenal back then. Mindblowing, quite frankly. Less so today. The movement is still really smooth and the designs are interesting, but it all looks so plasticky. The movie works around that admirably - most of the characters are made of plastic, after all - but it still leaves the movie looking flat and lifeless even when it's not supposed to look like it. I've heard it said that early hand-drawn animation looks charmingly simple, whereas early computer-animation simply looks cheap. And there's some truth to that, I'm afraid to tell.Still, Toy Story is a classic. Not my favourite Pixar film by far, but it did start something quite wonderful.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"It aged a bit, but Pixar's 1st Movie still holds up 29 years later","TDLR: I felt that Toy Story 1 is overpraised, but in a good way, TS1 still holds up many years later, and the fact that many people till watch and review this movie showed that Pixar did a good job at it.Watching the movies for the first time for Toy Story 1 was pretty magical, now I don't remember alot since I was only a kid and didn't really knew how the entertainment nor movies industry worked, I just thought it was awesome, but now that I'm much older as an 18 year old, I decided to re-watch this film and I'm actually on a marathon on watching both Pixar & Disney Films, so is going to take me a long time and prob some breaks since I do have education.Basically, my opinion for this movie is, I honestly think is slightly overrated, hear me out, I only say this because is merely my opinion, you are allowed to disagree which I recommend, but honestly, this film was very and I mean VERY solid, it was ahead of its time, was the first movie ever made with the animations but overall the characters, the actors, the story, etc. Was quite amazing, but sadly I feel like the movie did age a bit, one of my biggest criticisms is the fact that the dog look absolutely horrendous, I will give Pixar a pass since, this was 1995, in 1995, this dog looked pretty realistic for its time, but nowadays in 2024, yea this dog look pretty ugly, I've also noticed that some of the human characters do look a bit plasticly or even toy-ish like.Honestly, it isn't even the movie fault that I rated it quote on quote ""lower"" is just the fact that Toy Story 2 & Toy Story 3 exists, which not only expanded Toy Story Universe much better but the characters, stories and 100% the animation was improved SOOO much better.Toy Story is one of the finest movies/films Pixar have ever delivered but I feel like people should tone it down a bit with this movie, where's the love for Toy Story 2 & 3?Overall, this movie is pretty amazing, but I do feel like this movie isn't really that special nowadays.Pros:
The Vocals/Actors did AMAZING as their roles, Tom Hanks nailed it as Woody and many other characters.The Characters and Plot still holds up, it's interesting to wonder ""wait, do our toys actually move when we don't move?"" even back in 1995 this idea was quite unheard of, and Toy Story delivered phenomenally.Cons:

The toys are alive,"""Toy Story"" was, as known, the first movie of Pixar that should ""conquest"" the world after Disney's hand-drawn films were consider as mediocre. Except ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Cars"", ""Toy Story"" is the best of all the Pixar films (here comes a little SPOILER; this movie is not presented with the Pixar logo at the beginning of the film, before the title credits. SPOILERS OVER). It's like some TV-series; the first seasons are sometimes the best, right?Anyway, I watch ""Toy Story"" for the first time when I was 11 and I enjoyed it. It's never been my favorite movie of all times, but it's a enjoyable and watchable movie. The animation is gorgeous, the story is simple, but well-defined and the script is good. It's a good idea to make a CGI computer animated movie about toys that comes alive (SPOILERS; when the humans aren't watching. SPOILERS OVER).This film has some more adult humor comparing to the Disney hand-drawn films before 1995, which is quite good. (SPOILER) Most of the characters are simple and well-defined, except the sarcastic Hamm and Mr. Potato Head (not that I dislike them, but they deliver a more sophisticated humor than the rest of the characters). Woody is a more human main character, who makes really big mistakes in the movie, but learn what's wrong and what's right.My favorite characters were Buzz (I absolutely love his lines), Slinky (who stand up for Woody more than he deserves) and Scud, Sid's dog, who definitely should be in the sequel. (SPOILERS OVER).This movie has some scenes that could may be considered a little spooky for the youngest children, but for those who are 8 years old and upward, it's a suitable movieWhat I didn't like in this film is the score of Randy Newman, who is actually very annoying and too sugary for me. Unfortenaly he became the composer of most of the Pixar's film. But the songs in ""Toy Story"" are working quite all right.

The plot works from beginning to end. The performances are terrific--Tom Hanks and Tim Allen don't just blather their lines onto the soundtrack, leaving it for the animators to do all the work. No, rather, they're really *acting* here, imbuing their characters with as much depth and breadth as if they'd been playing flesh-and-blood people.Keep a sharp eye, movie lovers, inside gags abound: When Woody runs from an escaped globe, you'll think it looks just like the giant ball sequence from ""Raiders,"" and you'll be right! When Buzz walks amid a sea of tiny alien squeak-toys, Richard Dreyfuss' close encounter ""...of the Third Kind,"" of course, should echo in your mind.The look of the movie *is* stunning--and, IMO, it ""works"" in every instance but one: Syd's dog.

One of the greatest movies ever made,"I was a teenager when Toy Story was released in 1995. This means that I was both too old (and too young) to have much interest in it, and I gave it a miss.I thereafter ended up spending a couple decades of my life living in a world surrounded by Toy Story stuff, but never having seen it or any of its sequels.It was only after growing up and having kids of my own that I finally got around to watching it, with them. And only then did I realize what an absolutely wonderful movie this was.The existing reviews already cover all the things that make it so good and I'm not sure I can add much too what has already been said. I will just say that I've watched it (and its sequels) several times now (at my kid's requests) and somehow it doesn't get old or tiresome with repeated viewing, for them or me. The story and the character's emotional pull is just incredibly resilient. It makes me laugh, it makes me cry. I don't know of any other movie series that has done that to me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
My Favorite Animated Film EVER,"I love Toy Story. Plain and simple, it's a phenomenal film. Not only is it one of the most well-made animated films ever made, it's also one of my favorite films in general. It's incredibly appealing story, the voice acting is perfect, the characters are very likable and fun to watch on screen, and the animation is stellar for it's time.The basic premise of TOY STORY is life seen through the eyes of a toy. The film centers around the toys belonging to a boy named Andy, particularly following his favorite toy, a stuffed cowboy doll named Woody. Woody is primarily the one in charge of Andy's room, but his authority is threatened when Andy gets a new spaceman toy named Buzz Lightyear. The only problem is that Buzz doesn't know he's a toy. He genuinely thinks that he is a real space ranger.Tom Hanks voices Woody and Tim Allen voices Buzz, and both do a stellar job. I couldn't ever imagine anybody voicing these two characters besides Hanks and Allen. The supporting cast does a wonderful job as well, such as Jim Varney as Slinky Dog, Wallace Shawn as Rex, Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head, Annie Potts as Bo Peep, John Ratzenberger as Hamm, and others. The characters are so fun to watch, and you truly care about them as you watch Woody and Buzz form a friendship. At it's heart, Toy Story is a buddy movie, and one of the best made at that.While the animation seems somewhat dated today when compared to PIXAR's more recent films, the film does still look very nice. Looking back at the film, it truly is a technological achievement as well as a film-making achievement in general.Being the first animated film done entirely through computers, Toy Story had a lot of expectations to meet. And not only does it meet expectations, it surpasses them to infinity and beyond.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A childhood favourite,"Toy Story is one of those movies which holds a lot of good childhood memories for me. I first saw it in the cinema as a child, it was then worn out on VHS tape. Played to death on DVD & is now owned on special edition Blu Ray. It is by far, one of my favourite ever movies. Everything about this movie is perfect. It is a subject which is relateable to every single person who has ever watched this film; that our toys came to life when weren't there. In Toy Story the toys don't just simply come to life, they have their own world, their own relationships, their own problems and conflicts. But above all else they have friendship, loyalty & a special togetherness.The story begins with the Toys in Andy's bedroom. It is the day of Andy's birthday party and the toys gather round anxious awaiting the news as to whether a new toy has been given as a birthday present, and if it is to be Andy's new 'favourite toy'. The toy that is handed over as a present is the brand spanking new, space ranger, Buzz Lightyear. All the other toys are all in awe of him, all toys that is, expect for Woody, Andy's current favourite Toy. Woody feels threatened by Buzz and has no patience when Buzz genuinely believes that he is a real space ranger & not a toy. The story progresses sending the toys on an adventure which is like no other seen before!The casting for Toy Story is simply perfect. Tom Hanks & Tim Allen put in fantastic performances as Woody & Buzz. The relationship they create is so believable and they develop fantastic chemistry throughout the film. The best thing about Toy Story is the way it manages to involve you in the film. It makes you feel all of the toys emotions & really makes you feel for them. But at the end of the day they are just toys! We shouldn't get that involved yet somehow we do!Toy Story has many hidden meanings and gestures which really drive home the message of friendship and love. They are not cheesy, they are touching and realistic. This is what Disney do so well, they make children's films but whilst doing so they create them so they can be related to by adults.The animation is also on the money, this movie is almost 20 years old but looks as good today on Blu Ray as any other animation. Toy Story also has one brilliant soundtrack with several songs which will stay with you long after you have watched it. Overall I cannot recommend this film enough and I would recommend anybody to go and watch it, no matter what your age.A timeless classic. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The beginning of the computer animation movie legacy...,Toy is one of the most excellent computer-animated movies of all time.

One of a kind! - the first computer-animated film and a touching story of friendship,"This movie is just awesome! Bearing in mind that this was a film from 1994/95, the quality of the realistic 3D animation is stunning and what a perfect way to start a new era! Just as a new form of animation comes to life, a vast number of toys magically come to life when their child-owner Andy is out of the room. Maybe that's a true-to-life symbolisation! From the word go, every single one of those toys have become so famous and iconic. Argos (especially), Toys R Us, Amazon, Woolworths and more have never, since the film's 1995-release, been without stock of them! Like it says in the summary, it's a heart-warming story as well as a funny, super-cool movie about a pull-string ragdoll (Woody) whose popularity is short-lived as Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday as a result of new electronic toys hitting the market proving to be better than a just a ragdoll. Understandably, Woody is jealous of Buzz and can't stand his guts. He's an arrogant, self-interested toy but, more than anything else, an total, utter idiot.All the toys have their own personalities; there's Little Bo Peep who has a soft spot for Woody, Slinky Dog who likes Woody and is very friendly, Rex the world's most IRRITATING dinosaur ever, RC, the RC who revs up and down rather than talks and then there's Mr Potato Head and he is VILE! So, so mean and frequently rude. He seems to have some kind of vendetta against Woody for no reason I can think of. Then, he creates his very own campaign to destroy Woody in order to avenge Buzz when Woody's the one who has felt lonely and unwanted for so long! You'd think it'd put children off the authentic Mr Potato Head by Playskool! Oh yes and there's one more toy I didn't mention - Lenny, the toy-sized pair of binoculars. He was voiced by Joe Ranft who contributed in the story development of ""Toy Story"" and is now sadly no longer on this earth. He was killed when the speed of his car went beyond control, crashed through the wall of a bridge and plunged into the river below. The Pixar team miss him terribly...JOE RANFT 1960-2005",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
MUST SEE,Toy Story is without a doubt one of the best animated movies and one of the best Disney movies ever made! It's so wholesome but there's drama and comedy too. It's perfect for all ages which makes it a great family movie. On top of this one there are three more that follow it and a fourth rumored. Ive seen Toy Story so many times and never get tired of watching it. For me it's super nostalgic but once you see it you'll feel the same.

Where it all begins...,"Pixar strikes out in feature films with its first full-lengther, and the results are stunning! They set the bar almost impossibly high for anyone else interested in getting into full length computer animation. But what made Toy Story have such staying power and make the characters immediately house-hold names wasn't so much the technical brilliance (although it did dazzle), but the storytelling. Okay, case in point. Independence Day. The media hyped this up and it got a lot of viewers. It had a lot of effects. It dazzled our eyes (not our hearts) on the big screen. It sold a lot of DVDs. It made a lot of money...during its run. So who remembers it much now? For that matter, who will remember much of just about any of Roland Emmerich's films years from now? But who can forget Woody, Andy, Buzz, etc.? Who can forget that bedroom? Who can forget Sid? The writers at Pixar took a great idea which was understanding how many of us (even as adults) have emotional attachments to our toys and found a way to bring the heart of that idea and nail it down to a heartwarming story about friendship. That the technical details are flat out amazing for its time was an added bonus (even seeing reflections from Buzz's space helmet -- they didn't have to do that! The animators threw that in just to make the experience all the more special and believable). No other studio has ever come up to the standard set by Pixar. Dreamworks hasn't, though they have made a good film or 2. Sony Pics hasn't, etc. etc. Because they lack a great story to begin with, and when they do land upon one, they muck it up by trying to make it something it isn't. I can almost hear the writers in their studios thinking, ""Well, this is good, but we need to add more adult jokes so that the parent's won't get bored."" Advice, just follow Pixar's example and let the story unfold as it needs to. Pixar got it right and has gotten it right up through Toy Story 3. I fear we may be in for a nadir of creativity as we move into Cars 2, but we'll see...",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Disney/Pixar computer-generated cartoon has witty writing and incredible visuals to spare, though some scenes are heavy with chatter and the climactic race to catch up to a moving van is stretching things, even for a kid's picture. Still, some of the lines (which fly by at top speed) are very sharp and funny, and the star-voices (particularly Tim Allen's as Buzz) are uncanny. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Absolute perfection!,"Hard to believe it but this, one of my all-time favorite movies, is already five years old.  And you know what, it's aged beautifully.Without a doubt, this is one of the greatest animated films of all time.

Don't get me wrong, ""Toy Story"" would still get a solid ten (if only the ratings went to 11) on eye-candy value alone.

The one that started it all,"Toy Story will forever be remembered as the first feature film to be fully animated by computer. Since its debut in 1995, dozens more have joined it, including a sequel (soon to be two sequels as of this writing), as well as several other excellent films from its animation company, Pixar. However, for its unique accomplishment, Toy Story stands alone. It doesn't hurt that even beyond the technical achievement, the film is charming, well-written, and touching.The toys in question belong to Andy, who has a huge variety of them scattered around his room. The unofficial head toy is Woody, a cowboy toy who has ""been Andy's favorite since kindergarten"". Woody loves being the favored toy, but the order is shaken up when Andy receives a surprise present on his birthday: a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who causes Woody to become jealous when he begins to take over the #1 toy position in Andy's playtime.There's a lot of good stuff in this film: The animation, which mostly still works 15 years later; the voice acting, which is carried out excellently; the story, which keeps viewers engaged throughout. What gets me most about Toy Story is the way that both Woody and Buzz must grow throughout the movie. Woody has to let go of his jealousy and accept that things change when someone new enters the mix. Buzz has to learn (the hard way) that he really is a toy, but that he has a very important role as such. This is better character development than we see in some ""more mature"" films. It was here that Pixar began a long line of memorable, excellently crafted characters.Pixar has released ten feature films in the past fifteen years. Toy Story 3 this summer will make eleven. They've maintained a very high standard of quality during that time. It definitely helps that, with Toy Story, they were off to an excellent start.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Toys come to life in this entertaining computer-animated film from Pixar...,"It's only now, fifteen years after its release, that I decided to give TOY STORY a look on my large flat screen TV. I've never been a fan of computer animation per se, but this charming story has heart and wit and enough entertainment value for both young and old. The toy characters are both appealing and very funny in ways that anyone can appreciate, thanks to a clever script.Woody the Cowboy and Buzz Lightyear compete for the affections of a small boy, Andy, whose playroom is loaded with toys that come alive whenever anyone leaves the bedroom. Out of this fresh idea, the plot bounces along with supreme confidence as it races forward putting all of them in constant danger from their ever changing environment, especially when they leave the confines of Andy's home.Technically, the film is a marvel--everything simulated through computer wizardry, all of it invented with taste for artistry evident in every frame of the film--the kind of artistry that the Walt Disney studio demonstrated during the heyday of their cartoon wizardry.The brilliant colors look even more amazing in the good print of the film that aired on cable tonight.

Good beginning & end but unpleasant middle.,"I didn't care for most of the characters in this film. They were too mean spirited and I don't like Tom Hanks.

I also liked the end title duet. The score was good too. I wasn't over impressed by the animation since I consider story & characters to be more important.

Go above and beyond and you achieve greatness,"Toy Story was the first entirely computer animated film in its time of release in 1995, and it puts Pixar on the map for a generation of amazingly crafted films to be made. The attention to detail is exquisite in this picture as reflections, flexibilities, and movement are all captured in such a stunning format it's almost too much to comprehend. Everything moves so fluently, is crafted with such a broad mind it's still astonishing to this date.CGI animation is made with wondrous creativity and the possibilities to show off it's style are virtually unlimited. Though when companies in 2011 make kids movies like these they forget about the storyline and just make the film loud and colorful to attract the youth's attention. Not Pixar. Pixar is so much smarter. They understand good animation and a great storyline with characters. Show me a Pixar movie that isn't at least above average and I'll show you a car that can you can drive with no wheels.But CGI animation has it's downsides. Being released in 1995, Toy Story was the first computer animated film. Meaning other companies were racing their technology where everyone wanted to take advantage of the CGI craze. The main company in this heated competition was DreamWorks Animation Studios. Their first feature film was Antz, notable for being almost a direct knockoff of Pixar's A Bug's Life which came out the same year (1998). Following Antz came others like Chicken Run and The Road to El Dorado. Still none of which lived up to Toy Story's caliber.DreamWorks scored big when releasing Shrek in 2001. It definitely put them on the map of animation companies, and it's surely remembered more than Chicken Run. But still, while Shrek had a more rapid fire sequel release schedule than Toy Story, none of which had the same heart, message, or love any of these films had.One last downside is that CGI, no matter which way you look at it, killed hand drawn animation. Generations of kids now likely will never get to experience the classic animation like they should. If they do they will most likely hate it after being exposed to all the glossy and more stylish animation that is among us today. But shows like Beavis and Butthead and The Simpsons are just as good.Enough with the animation history, lets talk about the film. I doubt anyone will disagree with me, that this is one of the greatest animated films of all time. It combines clever antics with loving characters you become attached to. It's funny to think toys have a mind of their own. Plus all the trouble they would experience if they were alive.Andy (Morris) is a typical child. He has a number of toys of different varieties and enjoys making up little adventures the figures can go on. All ranging from a Mr. Potato Head, a cowboy doll, a toy piggy bank, and others. Woody (Hanks), a cowboy doll, who now feels threatened when a flashy, gadget filled toy named Buzz Lightyear (Allen) is given to Andy for his birthday. Buzz impresses the entire gang of toys much to the dismay and fear of Woody that he will become another forgotten toy.Simple premise. Giant execution. It's everything and more. In the nineties, this animation was simply groundbreaking. Because this was the first film made by Pixar, the standard hadn't been set yet. But it was clear after Toy Story that animation would be forever changed for more than one reason.Starring: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Annie Potts, John Morris, Laurie Metcalf, and Erik von Detten.

It really is that good. It's taken me 27 years to realise,"I think I owe Toy Story an apology.Even though I watched it countless times as a kid, and enjoyed it as a (very young) adult when I revisited it in 2013, I think I've taken it for granted a bit.Because yes, it doesn't quite have the same emotional impact as 2 or 3 for me, and the animation is undoubtedly tougher... but it's still such a fantastically well made movie, and it's a testament to the trilogy as a whole that it started so well and only got better (as for Toy Story 4? I still like it, but it doesn't feel as essential).This is just so well written, packed full of jokes, filled with great characters, and it's such a unique and creative premise. Also, the character arcs and personal journeys that both Woody and Buzz go through simultaneously are fantastic, and both are examples of almost perfect character development. It puts the writing in most non-kids movies to shame.And as for the limited, sometimes dated animation? A lot of the time it still looks alright to be honest. They made it work well for the most part, by choosing to animate toys. It didn't matter if what they animated looked a little plastic or mechanical- that can just be how toys that come to life would function. It works.Music's also really good throughout, as is almost all the voice acting.

I really like Don Rickles as the snarky Mr. Potato Head, Wallace Shawn as the neurotic Rex and John Ratzenburg as the laid-back piggy bank, Ham.The jokes are hilarious. One joke that passed me as a kid was when Woody wanted to call him something but couldn't due to there being a kids toy nearby.

Best Film of the 90's!,"That film has made its first success with the most beloved buddy picture of all time! The Next Who Framed Roger Rabbit I love how they try to make something different with CGI, because all they've done in the beginning were commercials and shorts. Ever since John Lasseter saw Tron, he knew that CGI would go all over the place. And boy has Pixar nailed it!The Story has taken itself to a whole new level, it's all about getting back to a young boy by using the power of teamwork, accepting for what you are, and telling the truth in an innocent way. Woody never meant to hurt Buzz, he just wanted to spend his life with Andy.The other toys are blinded by this accident that they decide to toss their leader out like garbage.Sid is what I believe the best villain for three reasons1.He's the bully for the toys2.He's stuck in the mind of a mad doctor or scientist3.He learns an important lesson that toys are meant to be in heaven, not in toy hell. Unless you're a Losto Bear who thinks that humans are the enemies.Man! This is the reason why people loved the 90's. There was a time when animation wanted to push itself to next level. And Toy Story was one the important examples of being the greatest survivors with a lovely story, fresh start animation, amazing characters, and epic songs by Randy Newman.This could be a fresh start for those who wanna tell stories.In fact I have novel that I'm working on.

Lost a vote cuz it was too short!!,"I want to get the recently re-released anniversary edition because this is a must have for any collection, be it animation or just good movies! What an absolutely funny, original and mesmerizing movie! I mean, come on, what kid in the history of the world doesn't, at some time, think their toys are alive. That's why girls talk to Barbie or have tea parties with all the toys, and guys chat with GI Joe and make believe the hot wheels can talk! Let's not even bring up our puppets! Pixar and Disney not only knock our socks off with the most amazing computer generated animation, but the writers of this story hit a home-run and totally captured the whimsical innocence of what we all knew was going on when we were kids; that our toys are alive and only want to be played with and cherished. In addition, the superb voice acting by a cast of actors that obviously still remember being a kid, only gives this instant classic the status of being the ""Gold Standard"" to which all others in this category will have to be judged. My only complaint and why I only give 9 out of 10, is that it is far, far too short, running 1 hour and 20 minutes! I know I'm selfish, but I want MORE!! I could and would have watched 2 or 3 hours of this! But that's why there's a Toy Story 2!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

You've Got a Friend In Me,"Toy Story Review: You've Got a Friend in MeToy Story was released in 1995 with help from production companies Pixar and Walt Disney Pictures. The box office collected nearly $364,402,211 worldwide off of this movie alone. While Toy Story was released over ten years ago, Americans of all ages today are still viewing the movie for leisure entertainment. Aspects such as plot development, thematic lessons, cinematography and animation, and originality are all qualities that make the movie stand above its counterparts. The plot development and basis of the movie are relatable to multiple audiences. The film takes place in a suburban, upscale neighborhood in which Andy Davis and his family live in a colonial, two story, stereotypical, 1990's home. While the family goes about living normal day- to day life, behind the scenes is where the action intensifies and this is where the story inevitably begins. What appeals to most children while watching the movie, are the ""talking toys"" that create their own story midst the chaotic Davis household. As the toys come to life, there are several characters that prominently take the spotlight. Beginning with Sheriff Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks. This is Andy's favorite toy, and inevitably takes on an established leadership role throughout the movie. Continuing on, the audience is introduced to heroic Buzz Lightyear voiced by Tim Allen. Buzz creates much skepticism amongst the other toys and consequently creates the first sub climax of the movie, as a struggle for power emerges between Buzz and Woody. As the movie progresses, there are many thematic lessons to be taken by audience members, regardless of age. Of course Disney never fails to incorporate enlightening take home messages into the production. This is the benefit to this movie in comparison to other animated films. Positivity in realm of life's negative events that are often out of our control is one way in which Disney and Pixar films continue to boast their movie popularity. Director John Lasseter thoroughly thought through every detail in the making of the movie, and this was never so apparent than in the close attention to detail portrayed in animation and cinematography. The colors used were bright and cheerful, as well as the authenticity of the costuming of the character's clothes were accurate in terms of realistic concepts. Furthermore, the voice lines conveyed by Allen and Hanks were portrayed with great enthusiasm to fit the characters' bubbly personalities. Lasseter also nailed this aspect in that the dialogue was simplistic enough to be understood by younger audiences, however witty, personal, and quirky enough to enthuse more mature audiences as well. Originality is a quality that every movie must have, but only the best of movies convey properly. The fact that this movie was released in 1995, and is still viewed today by many different generations is a quality that in itself deserves to be recognized. Looking back at the simplicity of talking toys, it is monumental and worth noting that many details to enhance viewer attraction were presented to perfection to thoroughly create a movie that satisfies a wide variety of audiences. The production was backed by such popular demand in fact, that producing companies and director Lasseter released a sequel four years later. Taking over the charts, both movies scored over an 8.42 on the IMDb rating survey collection, and deservingly so.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Not As Good As I Was Hoping,"This is another one of my ""I should like this movie better than I do"" films. It has an all-star voice-over cast (which I like all of them) - and that is the merit to this film and the story is cute and fun. I did get a few laughs out of the movie so I will not knock the film.So what is it about the film I dislike? The toys - not the actors voicing them - the toys themselves. All of the toys except for Rex (the T. Rex toy). I did enjoy the toon Rex - he was quite the comedy act. Mr. Potato Head was OK in the film but I never liked the toy as a kid - just boring to play with. The rest of the toys (or similar types) never interested me as a kid so they do not appeal to me in this film.It's a shame that I am not keen on this film since I really enjoyed films like ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Shrek"" and ""Chicken Run"".6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Pixar's debut film towards the golden age 8/10,"""Toy Story"" is the first ever film by Pixar Animation Studios, and the film that started the golden age for Pixar. A classic well known movie that everybody loves and remembers after 25 years. The story is so original and creative that it's pretty incredible to imagine how the creators thought of the concept. The idea of toys living and breathing, all aware that they are toys is nothing less than genius. The fact that Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) doesn't even know he is a toy and thinks he's a spaceranger is funny and gives the film a better storytelling. Both characters Woody and Buzz are different from each other, yet have to work together in order to survive. All characters in ""Toy Story"" are amazing, funny and full of characteristic.

But what amazes me the most is the emotional connection that it gives to anyone at any age and what keeps it together is the friendship between toys, even though they are only toys, the movie easily grasps the emotions of 2 people turned into best friends.Of course sometime in the future another animated movie will have the same success or more than Toy Story and may even beat it.

It's okay but over hyped,"I saw Toy Story in theaters when it first came out and it was alright but I wasn't impressed. Over the years I've come to dislike it rather than feeling neutral toward it. The concept of the movie wasn't new to me because I had already seen the Jim Henson film The Christmas Toy which was basically the same but instead of Woody the cowboy being the main character it was a tiger plush toy named Rigby and I prefer puppetry over CG anyway. Given that this movie was made in the early days of CG the people look really weird and fake, almost creepy, even the good characters. It seems to mainly focus on the petty squabbles between the jealous cowboy and the delusional spaceman. While the film has a few jokes the kids might not get, my over all impression is that the whole story lacks depth. You could maybe read between the lines and infer things but the movie glosses over most of the more serious stuff to keep the mood light. I didn't find any of the characters particularly likable either.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The Fantastic Ground Floor for Pixar's Wild Ride,"The visuals don't look as polished as you may have come to expect, so it's a testament to the quality of writing that this movie is still as good today as it was sixteen years ago. I can't undersell the ingenuity of the filmmaking either, as Pixar does more with limited technology and a thin rule book than most CGI artists can manage today. Careful, artistic shot selection and playful direction really do a lot to compensate for the occasional bad render, and a world-class cast of voice actors takes care of the rest. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen deserve every bit of recognition they get for their roles as Woody and Buzz; they really put the film on their shoulders and carry it right over the top, shifting something that would've probably been pretty good in other hands into a raging success story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Toy Story,Toy Story is a good movie. The main characters are Woody the cowboy and Buzz Light-year the space ranger. This movie has a lot of excitement and is a great movie to watch for people of all ages. Tom Hanks does an excellent job with Woody's character and Tim Allen is a real good Buzz. The animators of toy story do a super job with all of the characters and make the movies a pleasant see. In my younger days I used to wonder if toys could really talk. This movie brings out that imagination to life and creates a magical world in which toys are alive. This movie does a really good job in exploring the fantasy and imagination of children and their toys. All of the characters fit really well and this movie should be a classic for many years to come.

"""You are a toy!""","'Toy Story (1995)' is written incredibly well; everything just seems to fall, very satisfyingly, into place. What sets it apart from pretty much all others in its genre is just how flawed its protagonist is. He's a borderline anti-hero, self-destructively selfish for the movie's majority. This makes his arc all the more satisfying, though, even if it's about as classic as you can get. The friendship that forms between the two central characters feels palpable and genuinely fulfilling because it's nuanced and consistently strained. It really is remarkable that a film about talking toys has some of the most satisfying character arcs and central relationships of all time. Of course, the piece is also very funny. It fully uses its central conceit to deliver some truly inventive laughs. It doesn't feel as though it's pandering to children, either; in fact, it feels rather mature, all things considered. It's a fantastic time that will resonate with everyone who watches. It really is a classic, one to be considered amongst the greats - animated or otherwise. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Decent enough but no milestone,"Think of momentous years in Hollywood's history like 1927 (the year of the first talkie), 1932 (the first use of three-colour technicolor), 1935 (the first feature in full colour), and 1937 (the first animated feature).  I kept telling myself, in 1995, that I was witnessing something equally ground-breaking and historically important.  And who knows, maybe I was. The four historic films I alluded to above were `The Jazz Singer', `Flowers and Trees', `Becky Sharp' and `Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', only the last of which has any claim to being a classic.  `Toy Story' has no great claim, either.  In retrospect it was nothing new, just another instance of Hollywood's current infatuation with computer-generated images: pleasant, light and unremarkable.Computer animation is really a soulless device and, although I found it enjoyable, this is a soulless movie.  To begin with the animation wasn't quite ripe.  Toys, I suppose, are easy to animate: but when the flesh-and-blood children start to look as if they're also made of plastic, when the whole world seems to be made of plastic, the eye longs in vain for something else.Perhaps including children at all was a mistake.  A Hans Andersen toy story, a story that concerned toys and only toys, would have been more fun (and more moving).  The film betrays itself when it starts to think of the children.  The two central characters, after all, are BAD toys - horribly gimmicky devices that children very sensibly lose interest in after not so sensibly getting their parents to buy them some other worthless gimcrack. When Woody gave his speech about how important they really were in servicing a child's dreams and wishes and whatnot ... did anyone really fall for it? It would have been much more honest if he'd said, every toy for himself, kids be damned.I'm sorry if I sound overly critical - as I said, I liked it, so for me at least the slightly sour taste wasn't strong enough to ruin the film.  John Lasseter deserves credit for taking a formulaic buddy tale and breathing genuine life into it.  (All the more credit with a medium as unyielding as computer animation.)  `Toy Story' is pleasant and fun.  But frankly, every single traditionally animated film Disney has made from 1989 on, with the possible exception of `The Hunchback of Notre Dame', is better.  And - sorry to close with a carp - did Randy Newman really have to break into song so often?  Wasn't it enough for him to write the score, without croaking his songs out over it?",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"20 years later, it still rocks!","What more can be said? 20 years ago, Pixar released ""Toy Story,"" and the rest is animation history. Computer animation has since become the dominant form of animation. Dreamworks, Warner Brothers, and Universal (and maybe some other companies I have forgotten) have created their own computer animation studios to rival Pixar. Pixar themselves would continue to push just how far animation could go, both in animation quality and in storytelling ambition.So one may wonder, 20 years after this all got started, is the one that started it all still excellent by today's standards? The answer is an emphatic YES.The story is fairly well known by now, but I'll repeat it anyway for those who are unfamiliar. This ""Toy Story"" centers around the toy cowboy Woody (wonderfully voiced by Tom Hanks). Woody is the favorite toy of the young boy Andy (John Morris), who has several other toys, including Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky Dog (the late Jim Varney), and Hamm the Piggy Bank (John Ratzenberg, whose consistent appearances in Pixar films has become a running gag of sorts - and was acknowledged as such in ""Cars""). The film starts on Andy's birthday party, a time when all of his toys get nervous, because Andy might get a toy that he likes more than the others. Sure enough, he's received the latest ""cool"" toy, spaceman Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen, an inspired choice). This results in Woody being demoted to ""second best,"" something he doesn't take well at all. Woody attempts to push Buzz out of the way so he can get back to being Andy's favorite toy, but through a series of mistakes (and misadventures), he winds up making both he and Buzz separated from their owner Andy. Worse, they end up in the possession of their neighbor, Sid (Erik von Detten), who prefers to blow up his toys instead of play with them. Now Woody and Buzz have to make peace and work together if they are to return to Andy (oh, and did I mention that Andy is moving away soon?).The premise is simple enough, but it's in the execution where things get very inspired. Take, for example, how the toys attempt to learn what presents Andy is receiving. They send several Army Men Toy Soldiers down for a ""Code Red"" mission, and how these soldiers pull this off always puts a smile on my face. I still remember being inspired by watching the soldiers move that radio into that small leafy plant on the bottom floor (I was seven when I first saw this). I was so inspired, in fact, that a year later, I was ""teaching"" my toys how to hide in the Christmas tree during Christmas. Director John Lasseter and the Pixar team have deeply considered how a world of toys would work. How would a toy feel about getting relegated to ""second best"" when a new toy comes around? And it's pretty fun to see how the toys have to consistently make sure the ""human world"" never knows about their awareness.And the strength of this script goes beyond its consideration of a world of toys. Its tight and to the point. There are no wasted moments in the film's (short) 81-minute runtime. Pixar is not satisfied with simply showing what computer animation can do. They are interested in guiding along through a story that provides laughs, thrills, an occasional scare, and something valuable to learn at the end.Obviously, the quality of computer animation has improved greatly since this film first came out (watch how they animate a dog here, and compare it to how Pixar would animate Sullivan's fur in ""Monster's Inc."", for example). But let's remember, at the time, this was considered to be massively advanced animation. Many adult critics wondered if kids would realize just how big of a breakthrough this was in the history of animation, but I can reassure them, I may have been only 7 years old, but even I realized an entirely computer animated film was a very big deal indeed! Looking back now, I do think we should consider some of the things the animators did in this film that further emphasized what computer animation should be going for. Gene Siskel pointed out that you could see a reflection off of Buzz's helmet (and even stated, as a compliment, ""They didn't have to do that!""). The toys, the settings, everything was beautifully rendered and still looks good today. Even if one just reduced this picture to its visual qualities (inadvisable), they would still come out quite satisfied.Today officially marks the 20 year anniversary of when I saw this film (December 22nd, 1995), and it's high time I got to writing a review of it. ""Toy Story"" absolutely changed movies, and that is not a hyperbole. It's popularity made others realize the financial potential in computer animation. It's quality made everyone realize just what computer animation could (and should) pull off, both in visuals and storytelling. Pixar themselves would start a very long winning streak of highly acclaimed pictures, with many seemingly getting even more glowing reviews then the picture before it (heck we've gotten two great ""Toy Story"" sequels to boot). That this film still holds up even though many envelope pushing animated pictures have been released since is impressive indeed.20 years later, ""Toy Story"" still rocks!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Classic,"While this movie was definetly very influential in its time, and is reasonably so considered a classic in its genre, I think watching it now in 2020 just isn't as enjoyable.

So, my mom says we're taking care of my little cousin and wants to know if there's a movie out that we could see.

This is a terrific movie, but not because of the great animation.  The animation is cool, but like I've said, don't be that superficial that you judge the movies completely on animation.

The story is amazing and it took four creative screenwriters to write a good animated comedy film and it was just awesome to bring on screen.Do I really want to talk about this film so much? No. The acting in the film is cool and I think Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did great jobs as Woody and Buzz Lightyear and there are other voice actors including Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, Annie Potts and Jim Varney as Slinky Dog and they all do great jobs in their performances.The music by David Newman is really amazing and the Oscar song, ""You Got a Friend in Me"", has been known as the Toy Story film series' theme song and it is performed by David Newman. The editing and animation looks very amazing and so fantastic and spectacular that I can't stop watching this film.The characters and setting is really amazing and just cool. The film is just really cool, from beginning to end and it is just fantastic.So, overall, I love TOY STORY and everyone loves this film and this is a film that kids can grow up with. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Overrated, but still charming","I'll go with the negatives first, this is the worst and least funny villain of any Toy Story, and I think this is the most boring out of all of them. The climax is really fun but I just don't see the charm that everyone else sees in it. Of course, that doesn't make it a bad film, this film is Pixar's funniest, 2nd being Toy Story 2, and it still has a creative, great story. The thing is, I don't think this movie is an 8/10, but its not a 7/10 either. This is easily a 7.5/10 which is very annoying. Overall this film, although not a phenomenal film, is still VERY funny and is a good watch for the family.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An Entertaining Accomplishment,"This movie is one of the real achievements of the modern age, and a real measure of how good is the fact that you quickly forget your amazement at the computer animation and just get the story.We signed up to buy it the first day they had pre-orders and have enjoyed it since - and we didn't have kids then!A rare combination of many things that can be enjoyed by everyone.

Truly a classic,"With Toy Story 4 coming out in theaters this summer, I thought I'd go back and check out a beloved classice - the original TOY STORY (1995) to see if this film holds up to my memory of it.It sure does.Directed by visionary Pixar founder John Lasseter, TOY STORY is the first computer generated full-length motion picture and tells the...story...of toys that come to life when the humans leave the room. It is a simple concept that is executed beautifully with wit, charm and heart that sustains to this day and (I would imagine) to infinity...and beyond.Besides the revolutionary CGI work (which mostly holds up), the heartwarming story and the crispness of the pacing of the film, the masterstroke here is the pitch perfect voice casting. Tom Hanks was the first - and only - choice for Woody, the Cowboy doll that has been the main toy for Andy. His confidence is shattered when Andy receives a Buzz Lightyear action figure for his birthday and he struggles to maintain control of the room - and Andy's heart. In lesser hands, this character could be be annoying and a bit of a jerk, but with Hanks' inherent charm, Woody is lovable, neurotic and vulnerable as he tries to get out of one jam after another.Tim Allen wasn't the first choice for the voice of Buzz Lightyear, but with his success in 1994's THE SANTA CLAUS he was called into service on this film - and the results couldn't be better. He blends machismo, bluster and a sincere earnestness that perfectly pairs and counterbalances Hanks' tics to form a movie duo that ranks right up there with the best in film history.It is the attention to detail that these filmmakers really excel at and the supporting cast of voice actors really brings it here. From Don Rickles to John Ratzenberger to Annie Potts to R. Lee Emery to Jim Varney to Laurie Metcalf, all bring charm and heart to their characters even when they are in conflict.Speaking of attention to detail, the CGI in this film works really, really well - even after 23 years of improvements. The filmmakers were blazing a trail and there is much to look at in the background, from the 2 ""Hidden Mickey's"" in Andy's room to the tribute to THE SHINING, the background and renderings are lush and are worth a viewing just to look at hidden gems (and Easter Eggs) in the background.But none of this would matter if the story wasn't any good and I give story writers Lasseter and future Pixar Director's Pete Docter and Andrew Stanton credit for keeping the story crisp, clear and simple and infusing heart and sincerity without getting cloying or annoying. Interestingly enough, in looking at the credits, Joss Whedon, Joel Cohen and Alec Sokolow were all contributors to the screenplay as well. When I see that many writers on a screenplay, I worry about continuity and flow. But, make no mistake about it, this film has a strong vision driven by Lasseter and the results on the screen show that focus.If you haven't seen this film in awhile, give yourself a treat and check it out again, it holds up very, very well and will be well worth the 84 minutes it will take to watch it (the shortest of all PIXAR films).Letter Grade A+ - which means, of course...A rare 10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Not to be missed!!!!,"This is probably the best effort Disney has ever put into a movie and it shows!The animation can not be faulted (I even noticed reflections in polished wood tables when the toys walk across them!) the attention to detail in this digital world was brilliant.The characters were hilarious and I still laugh in all the same places after multiple viewings. It's a movie about friendship and doing the right thing after you make a mistake. A valuable lesson for young children.The jokes for adults are spot on aswell such as the quick ""Blink and you'll miss it"" scene where Mr Potatohead mocks another toy by taking his mouth off and patting his rear end with it. The word ""A##kisser!"" immediately came to mind and I laughed for ages at that alone! It was also subtle enough for young children watching to miss it altogether which shows how cleverly this movie was put together.Can't wait for the sequel!10/10 even better than Bug's Life (another Disney / Pixar collaboration) and that's high praise indeed!",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Aged poorly, but still enjoyable.","It's definitely a good movie, and despite being enjoyable, the graphics (yes, I know it's from 1995, but it still shows its age and feels jarring to the eyes) can be distracting.

It's a movie that, if you know you want to watch a film on the couch, you sit down, in the catalog pop ups ""Toy Story"" you watch it, and in the end, you don't feel like you've wasted your time, nor is it useless as entertainment, it's enjoyable to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story is the greatest Disney movie ever in my opinion! Looking forward to Toy Story 3 in two years!,"There is absolutely no question about it, Disney/Pixar's 1995 hit film, Toy Story, is their absolutely best film in my opinion.Pixar, the visual effects studio based in Northern California, was best known for making short films with three dimensional technology, including some Oscar winning shorts.In 1992 a script called Toy Story was completed and Pixar decided to take on the challenge of creating the world's first fully computer animated motion picture.In 1995, that script came to life, and the rest is history.Not only was Toy Story a gigantic hit for Disney and Pixar, it started series of films that continues to amaze and bewilder children and adults of all ages.The animation was state of the art, and continues to look amazing to this day. The characters, Woody, and Buzz Lightyear, to the humor were all amazing.Pixar won a special Oscar for making the first computer animated film, and it led to many more films of it's type to this day.Pixar, don't make us wait, please give millions of children around the world what we desperately need, more adventures of Woody and Buzz Lightyear!Here's to many more Toy Story films in the future, including the upcoming Toy Story 3 coming in three years, with Tom Hanks and Tim Allen returning as Woody and Buzz Lightyear!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Majestic,"The first outing of the Toy Story trilogy is a masterpiece of storytelling and technical brilliants for that time. The premise is bullet-proof with the Toy Story films based on the simple childhood fantasy That will exist for as long as children have played with toys and it will persist for as long as they continue to do so.I always have a special connections with Toy Story as it brings nostalgia from my childhood but not just that its characters are iconic with magic voice overs from Tom Hank and Tim Allen plus the other cast just enriches the film foundation to build on with an engaging witty script suitable for all ages which many films have failed in the past.Finally the spin-off films like Hawaiian Vacation, Partysaurus Rex and Toy Story of Terror! are a wonderful addition to the franchise with just as good as quality then most full length films out there today.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
You've Got a Friend In Me,"Who doesn't love Toy Story? The Toy Story series is likely one of the most popular Disney and Pixar franchises, and I can see why. This is one of many Pixar movies that reveals a secret world of things that either aren't alive in the real world or society has very little knowledge about, and the one that started it all.I read an article explaining that Tom Hanks wanted to voice Woody because the premise resonated with his childhood. As a kid, he wondered if his toys came to life when he left the room. While the idea of toys coming to life has been done before, it has never been quite like this. For instance, in the Winnie the Pooh franchise, the plush toys are alive due to Christopher Robin's imagination (as far as we know), and the stories would remain largely the same if the characters were anything other than stuffed animals.In contrast, the Toy Story franchise is not limited to a child's imagination; it provides a unique perspective by showing toys coming to life when humans are absent and the story being shown from their perspective, while still portraying them as ordinary toys that are played with by children. Woody, Buzz, and the rest of Andy's toys are a vibrant community, facing their own anxieties, dreams, and amusing escapades when humans are not around. Every child imagines their toys coming to life and going on adventures, and the franchise brings that fantasy to life in a captivating way. This ability to capture the magic of childhood imagination is one of the franchise's greatest strengths.Don't get me wrong; I adore Winnie the Pooh. Pooh and his friends being stuffed animals does have some impact on the stories, although not as significant as the toys in Toy Story. For example, if the characters were live animals, they couldn't be Christopher Robin's imaginary friends, and Eeyore couldn't lose his tail.Each Toy Story movie addresses common issues that children and toys face together in real life, adding its own unique twists. In this one, the story revolves around a child getting a new favorite toy and slightly growing out of the old one, which causes Woody to feel jealous of Buzz and ""lose"" his friends.If you've seen this before, you know that there are real-life toys and board games in it, like Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, a troll, Mr. Spell, a Barrell of Monkeys, Candyland, Battleship, and many more, which is another one of the movie's best aspects. Their presence makes perfect sense because this is a toy story, hence the title. They also make the movie feel like part of our world. I heard in a YouTube video that the presence of these toys has brought some nostalgia to the parents of those who were kids when this was new and helped increase their (the toys') popularity. It also led to a few significant changes to their real-life counterparts. For instance, Mr. Potato Head was given eyebrows for the first time, and Slinky Dog was brought back after being gone for decades, sporting the same dachshund-like design he has here rather than his original Pluto-like design.The animation is brilliant (for the most part), colorful, very detailed, and realistic yet cartoony at the same time. While this wasn't the first movie to use CGI, it was the first movie to be entirely in CGI, and I have to admit that it looks good for being Pixar's first movie. However, it is outdated in some areas. For example, the humans don't look as realistic as possible like the toys or even the Incredibles characters (but they do look decent), and Scud isn't fully rendered and doesn't have much texture. I find that understandable and justified due to this being Pixar's first movie. Furthermore, the animation looks even better in the sequels.I strongly appreciate the storyline of this movie. It's all about fun, adventure, friendship, teamwork, and overcoming odds. At first, Woody feels jealous when Andy gets Buzz Lightyear for his birthday, especially after telling the rest of the gang that nobody will be replaced. He worries about his bond with Andy breaking up and feels threatened by Buzz. But when they end up in a tough situation at Sid's house, they reconcile, work through their differences, and help each other escape. This leads to them becoming best friends and both getting what they want. Buzz feels sad when he finds out he's not the real Buzz Lightyear, but Woody's speech about the value of being loved by a kid helps him happily accept being a toy. I find Woody's advice about self-acceptance and being oneself to be important and heartwarming. Without the tough times they went through, Buzz wouldn't have realized the value of being a toy. Also, the movie shows that old and new toys, like Woody and Buzz, or people who prefer one over the other, can get along. Just because something is old doesn't mean it sucks or is outdated.Personally, I think the movie's message about embracing change and finding value in both old and new things is timeless and heartwarming. The characters' growth and the importance of friendship make Toy Story a classic that appeals to audiences of all ages. The movie does an excellent job of blending humor, emotion, and action, creating a truly enjoyable and memorable experience. I've had a very special place in my heart for Toy Story ever since childhood and always will. If you haven't seen it, where have you been for the last 29 years? You should check it out if you haven't before.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Plastic Fantastic,"Y'know, I always suspected that my toys were coming to life when I wasn't looking!In Andy's Room, his toys lead lives of noisy desperation come every birthday and Christmas - no one wants to be one-upped by a new addition to the toy box. Nominally led by Cowboy Woody (there's a Brokeback joke in there just waiting to happen), Mr. Potato Head, Rex the Dinosaur, Ham the piggybank, Bo Peep, Slinky the dog and a smattering of other playthings go about their toy business of playing checkers, hanging with the hometoys and ""plastic corrosion awareness meetings,"" until Andy's birthday party, when they gather expectantly around a transistor radio, listening to the reports of their toy soldier troops ""in the field"" (downstairs watching Andy's gift-opening), hoping that no gift will be exciting enough to cause Andy to neglect *them.* There is. His name is Buzz Lightyear, Space Ranger.Directed by Pixar mainstay John Lasseter, with the voice talents of Tom Hanks (as Woody), Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger (forever Cliff from *Cheers*), R. Lee Ermey, Annie Potts, Jim Varney and Tim Allen (as Buzz), *Toy Story* is that *rara avis* that succeeds on all levels - in its animation, storyline, character development, its messages of friendship and self-realization and, most importantly, its entertainment value. The fact that this is a cartoon (or animated feature - just what DO we call this new wave of computer-generated movies?) is incidental. Which makes the slightly dodgy animation (of the ""real people"") irrelevant - it gets the point across with or without the technological finesse.The ""Disney Movie"" has become synonymous with maudlin messages, redneck fundamentalism, anachronistic family values, boneheaded parents, smart-mouthing youngsters, too-hip-to-be-smart teens and insufferable pets. Though Disney's tyrannical umbrella overarches this film's production studio, Pixar Animation, *Toy Story* somehow avoided all trace of Disney's craven hand, which is doubly surprising, considering this is Pixar's first feature length film, after years of experimentation. Right outa the gate and right outa the field.Sure, there are ""messages,"" but they are heartfelt, rather than maudlin (Woody tells Buzz during Buzz's greatest depression that it matters not what Buzz thinks of himself, what makes him important is what his owner, Andy, thinks of him); there are emotional segments, which are truly heartbreaking, rather than cheesy (when Buzz's escape attempt lands him with a broken arm, proving he is Not A Flying Toy, the lyric, ""Clearly I will go sailing no more,"" launches a thousand hankies); and the portrayal of Andy's family was Pixar's triumphal achievement. Boldly contravening Disney's *idée fixe* of the 1950's nuclear family and Norman Rockwell fantasies, one of the many incarnations of a modern-day family is presented: a single mother with two kids, who are neither geniuses nor monsters, just normal children; happy to visit Pizza Planet and disappointed when favorite toys are lost.Buzz - who believes he is a real life space ranger on a mission to save the universe - become Andy's favorite toy over Woody. The funny thing is: though Buzz believes he is real, he still adheres to toy protocol of ""playing inert"" when humans are in the area. (Maybe it's instinct?) When he mentions saving a toy from Sid, the vicious boy next door, how does he propose to do it if he is to adhere to the inert protocol? Buzz's ingenuousness regarding his role as a toy infuriates Woody to the point of attempted toy-assassination. Through a concatenation of accidents, both he and Buzz become lost and must use teamwork, trust and ingenuity to beat their path back to Andy, which finds them ensconced in scorchingly funny vignettes (Buzz fastening himself in an over-sized seatbelt; both falling in with green, three-eyed aliens; Buzz hyperventilating as ""Mrs. Nesbitt""). During a climactic rocket ride, the callback line, ""This is not flying - this is falling with style,"" simply seals this movie's greatness.At least I now have a plausible explanation as to why my toys always got lost: after going about their toy business, they would just go inert anywhere they happened to be, instead of paying attention to their master's infallible toy filing system.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A Creative Introduction to 3D Pixar,"Coming out the gates busting with a strong movie is important in proving yourself as a studio, even more so when you use new technology to its fullest effect, which is evident in the wonderful if simplistic toy story.The voice acting throughout is strong, especially from Tom Hanks, Don Rickles and Erik von Detten whose twisted touch of menace is charming.The 3D models look fantastic, and although a touch plastic, are animated really well. The freshness of the locales and environments inject a degree of immersion and are fantastical.

"If You Saw This As a Kid and Haven't Seen It Since, Feeling You Have Outgrown It, You Must Revisit It, For You WIll Discover Quite the Contrary.","Toy Story fashions an existence as its characters know it out of a couple of young kids' bedrooms, a gas station, and an expanse of suburban freeway. It also enters an arcade- restaurant that recaptures that consumerist wonder of being a kid surrounded by video games and pizza. Its heroes are toys, which come to life when nobody is watching. Its conflict is between an old-fashioned cowboy doll who has always been an 8-year-old boy's favorite toy, the effective leader of the kid's toys as a collective community, and the new action figure who is starting to take his place. The villain is the grungy kid next door who takes toys apart and puts them back together again in morbid mishmashes, that is when he's not blowing them with fireworks. And the result is an emotional roller-coaster of a movie experience that does not diminish with age.For kids, a movie like this works immaculately because it tells a fun story that presumably exists already somewhere in their minds when they are playing with their own toys. They can relate very deeply to these toy characters because of the role toys play in their lives. Older viewers can be even more immersed, because you find that after all these years, you still have such emotion invested in these toys. When Woody peeks from the toy chest at his boy, Andy, sleeping with Buzz Lightyear in his arms, I am truly touched. If you saw this as a kid and haven't seen it since, feeling you have outgrown it, you must revisit it, for you will discover quite the contrary.In a way, it could have been even more interesting and rewarding to have been your parents' age in 1995 when the film emerged as the first film animated entirely by computer. To us as kids, visual nuance was the last thing on our minds. The most rudimentary elements of the cinematic experience were all that mattered to us, and we were transported. Now, we are completely accustomed to Pixar's series of family films that transcend what one normally perceives as the cornball throwaway inanity of so many of them.John Lasseter opens the film in the---let's face it---spoiled 8-year-old's bedroom, where the toys come to life when their owner is gone. Each of the toy characters is rich and detailed. The playroom cunningly figures in well-known toys from real life, which may be product placement, but who cares when it functions as a great way for us to relate that much more with these characters by means of direct familiarity.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

And, of course, I've had it on VHS, DVD and BluRay to watch multiple times.One of the things I've always admired about Toy Story is how nice the animation looks for the time it was released. Pixar clearly had access to the best equipment and talent when they put this film together, and it shows. There isn't a single aspect of the film that's overlooked. It's got serious star power in the casting department (Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are both incredible, respectively, in their leading roles), you've got a great score (some of the better work from Randy Newman, who I've never been a big fan of personally), it's got a unique story that's executed in just the right way to ensure the proper emotions are being conjured up at any given point during the film. Pixar has what I can only compare to a mathematical equation by which they tell their stories; everything is carefully constructed and calculated, and every move they make in the stories pays off well.It was the most appealing or entertaining of the Pixar stories to me growing up (or even now), but to look at the film and everything it was accomplishing in its time and to say it offers nothing of merit would be blatantly untrue.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar kick ass!,"Yap. Those talented people at Pixar shows us that computer animation can be just as alive and creative as drawn animation. People think that the computer ""does all the hard work"", but that's not true. 3D animation can be just as difficult, if not more.The voice talent people are great and the animated characters clicked well with the pre-recorded voices. Everything from the toys' facial expressions to body postures is done well, but the real success of the movie comes from a perfect script.As long as the same creative team sticks around, I wouldn't mind ENDLESS sequels to TOY STORY.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A utter triumph that will live in our hearts forever,"this film changed my life, it showed me my favorite creative medium and molded my skill as a creator and as a human being.Review -The film opens on a simply stunning sequence of a young boy named Andy playing a make believe game of Cops and robbers with a gang of toys. Its pointed that a toy named ""Woody"" is the favorite of the young boy. As Andy leaves to join his mom and friends for his birthday, the toys come to life and almost have a human like society set up. There's rules democracy and a sense of organization. As these toys investigate the party for new toy arrivals, woody senses something is not right when a new toy named ""Buzz Lightyear"" arrives on the scene. Jealousy follows that sets the 2 toys down a path of despair and self finding that ends in a climatic scene that has me in tears every time i see it.This films impact on me and everybody that has watched is apparent and amazing.10/10 Live on in our hearts toy story to infinity and beyond!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Super Entertainment for All,I have watched this film many times with my kids and never tire of it. Original plot and superb characters make this movie a joy.  Great animation.

"They Don't Call it ""Playing"" for Nothing.","The opening scene says it all. Film-making begins in early childhood, as children use their toys to create little scenes (or movies if you will). The word ""play"" when used to describe such activity indeed derived from the movies of another era, plays. Or perhaps the other way around. Either way, the point of this film is to show that creating a film and playing with toys are virtually the same thing.So the film is basically about itself. A play about playing. This is exactly the type of multi-layered construction that I believe subconsciously challenges and nurtures our kids' minds. Teaching a child (or adult!) to think on more than one level at a time is simply a gift.It should also be applauded that it's all substance and no fluff. Other animation teams have inundated their films with meaningless pop culture gags, camp, and nostalgic irony. Not to mention an abundance of toilet humor. Music by the great Randy Newman instead of the Village People.None of the mindless pandering to adults here, either, yet we are included in the fun by being subtly reminded of our own play days. Barrel of Monkeys. Potato Heads. In fact there is a strong undercurrent theme here as the classic cowboy toy is threatened by the flashy new space man who is obviously being pushed on kids via a relentless marketing campaign. We 30-somethings must root for Woody. It's Wal-mart vs. our favorite mom-n-pop corner store.These Pixar guys are brilliant, and I believe they will be revered someday as perhaps the most important influence in all of filmdom during the turn of this century's period. There is no more sure thing than a Pixar offering. Always compelling, engaging, intelligent and abstract. And this one is the best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Tales of Toydom,"Toy Story is a delightful and groundbreaking film that stands as a monumental achievement in animation. Released in 1995 by Pixar Animation Studios, it became the first feature-length film entirely created using computer animation, setting a new standard for animated storytelling and leaving a lasting impact on the genre.The story centres on Woody, a loyal cowboy doll voiced by Tom Hanks, who finds his status as the favourite toy threatened by the arrival of Buzz Lightyear, a flashy space ranger voiced by Tim Allen. What starts as a rivalry soon evolves into an unlikely friendship as they embark on a thrilling adventure to return to their owner, Andy.Hanks and Allen deliver stellar voice performances, imbuing their characters with warmth and personality. Woody's blend of leadership and insecurity contrasts perfectly with Buzz's delusional confidence, and their dynamic becomes the emotional heart of the film. Their evolving relationship provides both humour and depth, making their journey engaging and meaningful.The animation, while modest by today's standards, was revolutionary at the time and still retains a certain charm. The attention to detail in crafting the world from the toys' perspective-everything from their movements to their unique view of everyday objects-adds a layer of whimsy and creativity that is one of the film's key strengths.Randy Newman's music, particularly the heartfelt You've Got a Friend in Me, perfectly underscores the film's themes of friendship and loyalty. The song has become synonymous with the Toy Story franchise and remains one of its standout moments.While Toy Story is undeniably entertaining and innovative, its relatively straightforward plot and smaller scale may feel less impactful compared to later entries in the series. Nonetheless, it is a testament to Pixar's ability to combine humour, emotion, and exceptional storytelling into a film that resonates with audiences of all ages.In conclusion, Toy Story is a charming and influential film that captures the magic of childhood imagination. With its endearing characters, witty dialogue, and groundbreaking animation, it laid the foundation for Pixar's dominance in animated films. A joyful and nostalgic trip into the world of toys, Toy Story is a must-watch for anyone who loves heartfelt storytelling.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Falling with Style,"In a world in which toys talk and move whenever humans are not looking, a cowboy doll experiences jealousy for the very first time after an action figure replaces him as his owner's favourite toy in this popular animated comedy. The premise lends itself to a number of perplexing unanswered questions (in particular, regarding the 'rules' that the toys follow to freeze as soon as there is the possibility of a human seeing them move) but if one accepts the basic notion and runs with it, the film offers a surprisingly compelling story with striking personal identity themes as both of the main toys come to realise that they are not as special as they once thought. For Woody, it comes with realising that his owner can have other favourite toys and for Buzz it comes from awakening to the fact that he actually is a toy and not the famous space commander that he is designed as being. The film is blessed by excellent animation effects too; while many entirely computer generated animated films have come out in the years since, few have used the process quite so delightfully with lots of mobile tracking and panning shots that would have been near impossible to get right in a live action feature. The changing facial reactions on the toys (especially Woody) are impressive too - even if the fact that the toys in the film look more realistic than the humans in the film never quite feels right. This is, of course, a film about the toys though, and fanciful as the premise may well be, there is a lot to like about their loyalty both towards their owners and each other.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Innovative for Its Time, But Not My Favorite","Toy Story is often celebrated as a groundbreaking film that revolutionized animation and launched Pixar into the spotlight. The story of Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and their adventures in a world where toys come to life is one that has charmed audiences for decades. The film's clever writing, endearing characters, and innovative use of computer animation have made it a beloved classic.Despite its status as a milestone in animation history, Toy Story didn't quite hit the mark for me. While I can acknowledge the creativity and technical achievement, the story itself didn't engage me as much as I had hoped. The characters, though well-crafted, didn't leave a strong impression on me, and the humor and heartwarming moments that many adore felt a bit flat.Toy Story is undoubtedly a significant film in the history of animation, but on a personal level, it didn't resonate with me. I give it a 3/10 for its innovation and cultural impact, but it's not a movie that I particularly enjoyed.",3.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
All the things that truly matter about the movie have not aged a day,"TOY STORY is a movie I tend to only revisit now and then, but man, is it truly a modern classic! Though the textures and human characters are quite dated by our standards, the story and film-making craft remain timeless. The comedy and suspense play off one another well, and rarely has a domestic setting like this ever felt so epic in scope. Like Disney's debut feature SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, Pixar's TOY STORY is imbued with a sense of playful discovery, innocence, and joy that lets it stand apart from the studio's later output. While they would go on to make more sophisticated films, TOY STORY's strength is in its simplicity and youthful spirit-- just a perfect movie in all the ways that matter.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
What a classic,Ive always wondered if my toys came to life when i was a little boy. I guess they do! This movie was awesome. It was really funny but the creativeness of the movie steals the part. Somebody came up with a good story. Very Imaginative. The best part is that it has a worthy sequel that i believe is better but they rate the same because they are both great.

The Best Animated Movie of All Time,"1995's Toy Story is a work of pure imagination. It covers topics of fantasy, friendship and jealousy. It also contains relatable characters which shines out compared to other animated films. The actors were perfectly cast (Tom Hanks as Woody, Tim Allen as Buzz - the list goes on...) and the intricate plot can be compared to some of the best movies ever. I think everyone in the world has seen Toy Story, but if you haven't, it's a must see. Its by far superior to its two sequels, but they are decent. Not only is it a great film, it is historically significant, as it was the first fully 3D animated film. You HAVE TO SEE THIS... J",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story (1995) - My Toys are Talking!,"Disney-PIXAR's first ever CGI-animated movie ""Toy Story"" is one of the best animated movies I have seen in years. The movie brings smart ideas, charming heart, and loving characters including Woody, Buzz, and the rest of the gang of toys. The movie begins with Woody, a cowboy toy, who used to be the star of the toy chest, until this new toy arrives after the owner's birthday, named Buzz Lightyear, a space ranger toy, with beliefs that he's a real space ranger. This leads into fr-enemy rivalry involving these two toys, until they learn the true meaning of friendship. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen provide the voices for these well-known characters, and they did a great job of bringing talking toys to life. I thought the movie was excellent at writing some kind of every day diary through the eyes of toys. I think Pixar knows how to push the envelope with great ideas of animation, and they started this success with ""Toy Story"". I thought the movie is excellent in every way, it never leaves a single heart, and we grow up watching this movie and we never get tired of watching the old-fashioned buddy pictures, which made ""Toy Story"" a big success to critics and the box office. I really enjoy watching this movie over and over, and it always takes me back to my childhood. ""Toy Story"", in my review, ""brilliant in every way, and always a loving memory"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Great fun, a film that's not just for kids","I wasn't too sure about this film before I watched it. The premise (basically of showing the secret lives of toys) sounded great, but I'm not a particular fan of the often sickly-sweet Disney, not to mention that I've seen several other computer animated films that were so-so, but didn't really live up to their hype. So it was with pleasant surprise that I found myself enjoying every minute of Toy Story.The plot is straight forward; a bunch of toys, who live in a young boy called Andy's bedroom, come to life, walk, talk, and generally get up to mischief when no-one's around. They're lead by Wild West Sheriff doll Woody (superbly voiced by Tom Hanks), who, being Andy's favourite toy, takes it upon himself to organise all the toy's activities and make sure that they return to their proper place when anyone comes near. But Andy's birthday is coming up  something which the toy's are fearing, because that means one thing: presents; new toys, which if they're unlucky, could result in some of them being turned out for the next yard sale to make space!Woody's life as the much-respected `leader' of the toys is bliss, until the fatal day of Andy's birthday, when the boy's last, biggest present turns out to be a galactic crusader Buzz Lightyear figure (voiced by Tim Allen), a shiny new toy with a lot of fancy features. Woody soon finds himself knocked off his place as most popular toy, and before long, he's planning to get rid of Buzz, which not only results in him loosing his respect from the other toys, but ultimately winds up with himself and Buzz being lost away from home.Despite my initial worries about this film just being another over-hyped sickly Disney picture, I was not only pleasantly proven wrong, but would go as far as to say it's one of the most enjoyable, memorable films I've seen for several years (okay, well the film is 6 years old, but I've only just seen it!).The voice actors are great and do the animated creations justice, and it's wonderful to see so many great toy characters brought to life. Some of the toys are created based on classic toy designs, while others  such as Mr. Potato Head  are based on real existing ones. The other toys who inhabit the bedroom include Slinky' Dog (complete with springy middle), Hamm the Piggy Bank, and Bo Peep  who has a soft spot for Woody. My personal favourites are the classic green toy soldiers (who are dispatched on a covert mission to report back to the other toys on what Andy's birthday presents are), and Rex, the plastic dinosaur who can't be just scary no matter how much he tries!The story is nice and straight-forward, and as with all great simple stories, that works in it's favour and is what makes the film so enjoyable. It doesn't get bogged down in too many whats, hows and whys too much, it just delivers a wonderful world where toys come to life behind their owners back.Despite all the flashy computer generated graphics and animation, beyond that the story has a wonderfully classical' feel, being sure to deliver some good old morals with it's tale. There's no violence (well, unless you consider a plastic toy falling out of a window violent!), no bad language, and you just know that things are going to wind up alright by the end of the story. There are no real bad guys; the main conflict is based around Woody's jealously and dislike for Buzz. The film's only real villain is Sid, a cruel neighbouring kid who enjoys destroying toys in as messy and as extreme ways possible.The film is one that will appeal to all ages. As I said, initially I was rather put off by the Disney' label, fearing it would be the typically childish, by-the-numbers, squeaky-clean American tale as seen in so many other Disney films  particularly the animated ones in recent years. But there really is universal appeal in this film, with its wonderful mix of slick graphics, good voice acting, and sheer fun of bringing toys to life on screen. It's generally suitable for and will appeal to all, from very young to very old. The only bit that very young might not like so much is the scenes where Woody and Buzz are trapped at Sid's house, and they meet a horde of nightmarishly tortured' toys, that have been broken and re-assembled by Sid into creepy new creations.All in all, a great film, and one that stands the key test of being enjoyable enough to watch over and over again.And you know how all those times when you were a kid, much to the annoyance of your parents, your toys always seemed to end up in a mess and not where you left them?

Not to mention that the absolute perfect voice talents were cast to make such a memorable movie for kids and adults and teens and preteens and seniors and new borns or anybody else who eyes and hears or either or.

We get into the behind of the scenes: The toys are not just living a simple life, but they have their own community with their own rules, routines, and cultures, brought by all types of toys, everything from a shark toy to a potato head. Every toy has also it's own personality, which gets quite interesting and entertaining.

"Toy Story: My Good, Bad, and Ugly","The Good:
Toy Story set the benchmark not just for the animated films that Pixar would produce in the decades since, but for films from other animation studios like Dreamworks and Disney Animation. Most importantly, this film ushered in an era of animation that is truly fun for the whole family. Rather than filling the time with cute animals, catchy songs, and a story that caters to the lowest, or youngest, common denominator, each of these elements is subtly accentuated and elevated so adults in the audience can appreciate the humor, themes, and well crafted narrative alongside the youth in the audience that are the film's target demographic.The Bad:
It's very difficult, if not impossible, to find fault with this film. Since it's release, Toy Story has been lauded for every aspect of its production by critics, industry insiders, and audiences at large. But, the years that have past since the film's release have become its biggest drawback. Pixar has released 20 films since Toy Story graced the screens at the time of this writing, including 3 direct sequels to this film. With each new film Pixar has released they've innovated the technology and techniques to define the ever-evolving standard of computer animated films. With each new benchmark in the genre this film has fallen further and further behind looking less and less like the state of the art film that it was in 1995.The Ugly:
To piggy-back off of my ""Bad"" for this film, it's hard to find a film that did it better than this, but perhaps we can look to the direct sequel, Toy Story 2 (John Lasseter, Ash Brannon, and Lee Unkrich, 1999). This follow up did everything to one-up it's predecessor. It expanded the world around Woody, Buzz, and company outside of a few simple settings and added an exposition for Woody that accentuates a part of what was good about the first film. Adult viewers at the time of release might have been taken back to their own youths and the corporate studio television shows with toy tie-ins like The Mickey Mouse Club and Howdy Doody. With growth and maturity in the studio's ability to create engrossing stories and improvements in animation in the four years between releases, this film further entrenched the franchise, and solidified Pixar as the premier computer animation studio.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

It was 1995, this was probably the best animation anyone had ever seen up to that point. The story is perfectly written and the concept is even better. Whoever came up with the idea of talking/walking toys with personalities whenever the kids weren't looking is a genius and should've got a nice fat paycheck. I don't know if this'll end up being the BEST pixar movie after my rewatch, but it will definitely be one of the best.

Toy Story,"Every now and again when you watch antiques programmes on television and somebody turns up with a toy in it's original box - that turns out to be worth more than his car - I regret that I no longer possess any from my childhood. I do recall, however, being especially fickle - the favourite one day was never likely to reign long before being supplanted by another. That's the case here for cowboy ""Woody"". He is the favourite of owner ""Andy"" amongst, it has to be said, rather a lot of different ones. Until, that is - one birthday, we meet Space Ranger ""Buzz Lightyear"". He's actually quite an affable chap, but the green eyed monster is now in charge and ""Woody"" tries to relegate his successor down the side of the bed. That goes wrong and, accidentally, out of the window he goes. The other toys are horrified, leaving ""Woody"" with no option but to get over his laser envy, rescue his new rival and repatriate him before the whole family move to a new home! What now ensues are some fun escapades, near misses and they fall into the hands of another young boy who really does want to blast ""Buzz"" into space. The vocal talents of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are enthusiastic and entertaining, those of Don Rickles (""Mr. Potato Head"") sometimes a little nearer the bone for the grown ups and they are all helped along by a good soundtrack and a wittily written script offering us plenty of scenarios that draw the viewer (of whatever age) into this simple, pretty timeless story. It's interesting, for 1995, to note the wide variety of toys this young boy has, too - no gender stereotyping, which is quite refreshing. This is quickly paced and enjoyable animation that touches on the values of trust, companionship and team spirt - as well as the demerits of envy and selfishness - and I really enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

I now wish I had seen this movie years ago, instead of waiting for a cheap LD clearance sale.TS, while adhering to Disney movie traditions, is an entertaining diversion, and historically important as a computer-rendered movie to boot.  The difference between Disney and Pixar sensibilities concerning humor are evident early on; one is thankful that Disney gave so much lee-way to Pixar concerning story and dialogue.  While I can't say that I was as entertained by the goings-on as average Disney fans, I can say that the results are much better than standard Disney fare.  (In fact, if you can find this for under $50 on laserdisc, I can assure that your entertainment dollar is well-spent)The LD contains the pre-TS Pixar shorts (worth the price of admission) as well as director's comments, and much more.

While the animation may get more dated, the film is and always will be one of the BEST movies ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A timeless classic.,"Toy Story is truly a groundbreaking film. The animations are amazing and the story and these characters are so lovable,humorous and just flawless no matter how many time you have watched it. Woody and Buzz beat a giant ogre and a talking donkey any day of the week. The animations on the film inspired movies like The Incredibles, Shrek,Finding Memo and others. Toy Story's plot is about a boy named Andy whose playing with his toys, such as a Mr. Potato Head, Rex, and his favorite toy, Woody. He takes Woody into the living room and plays with him some more, where he learns Andy has planned his birthday a few days early, as himself, his mother, and his sister Molly will be moving. Woody gets put back in the room, and when Andy leaves, he's revealed to be the leader of the toys, and orders them to be prepared for the party. All the toys work together, aware that new toys could mean the replacement of current ones, but Woody keeps them calm. After Andy goes through all his presents, he's surprised by one last present from his mother. The present is revealed to be a new must-have Buzz Lightyear toy.They all return to their places as Andy and his friends come running up to Andy's room. When they all run out, the toys approach the Buzz Lightyear action figure. Buzz does not seem to be aware that he is a toy, which becomes apparent after he sees the package he came in (a space ship shaped box) to be his damaged ship. He believes himself to be a space ranger on a mission to save the universe from ""the evil Emperor Zurg."" The other toys take to him immediately, being impressed by his many features. Only Woody is unconvinced, showing jealousy towards Buzz. As time moves on, Andy clearly shows to have high regard of Buzz, seemingly forgetting about Woody, as with the other toys who Buzz spends a lot of time with. By the end of the day, Andy sleeps with Buzz in his arms and confirms he has a new favorite toy. Eventually, Woody confronts Buzz while he is repairing his ""ship"" where he finally realizes that Buzz actually believe himself to be the real space ranger, and not toy model of the character.Andy is given a surprise trip to his favorite restaurant: Pizza Planet. However, he can take only one toy with him. Knowing this, Woody assumes he'll take Buzz so he tries to shove him behind Andy's dresser, but instead inadvertently knocks him out the window. When the other toys learn of Woody's actions, they think he has turned into a killer. They try to attack him without even giving him a chance to explain, but he is saved when Andy come into the room to look for Buzz. Unable to find Buzz, Andy takes Woody on the trip instead. At a gas stop, Woody finds that Buzz grabbed a hold of the family's minivan and is with them. Woody tries to apologize but Buzz won't listen, and starts a fight which knocks both out of the minivan that causes them to be left behind. I remember watching this film when i was about four years old and having Woody and Buss figures and waiting for them to come to life when they thought i wasn't looking. That's the impact a film and interesting Toy characters could do to a little kid. This film remains my favorite animated movie ever and one of my favorite movies ever. Talking Toys, a mean bully who hates toys, a thrilling adventure with spectacular animation and some of the best characters ever. There is not much to go into about the plot or anything, it is simply put a perfect film for all ages it even has some small adult humor and that you don't get anymore. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Goodbye Traditional Animation and Hello Computer Animation,"When I saw clips of this film in advertisements, I thought this was a film featuring real life toys moving in stop-motion. It was not until I watched the film in VHS that I found out that the film uses CGI. Although traditionally animated movies were still popular upon Toy Story's release, moviegoers slowly began shifting to computer animated media. A few years after the year 2000 is when the general public began favoring CGI films a lot more.Personally, I still like traditional animated films because they provide a more storybook-like picture. Computer animated films are indeed more complex although they make film look more like video game rather than a movie.As for the film here, the acting is well done and the plot is as good as any high class film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Ground breaking...but animation doesn't hold up,"Oy Story is definitely a monumental film. It's the first 3d CGI animated film. It has great voice acting from Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, and the characters of Woody and Buzz are very well-defined. The conflict is set up quite nicely and there's a satisfying story within the movie. There are moments that are genuinely terrifying for children and for adults. Another great thing about the film is the iconic song You've Got a Friend in Me. Randy Newman really excels at writing those kinds of songs. Having said all of that and getting a mountain of praise out of the way for the movie which it completely deserves it, the film doesn't really hold up. The animation is very creepy, it is solidly in the uncanny valley. The toy characters are fine because they're toys, and you don't expect toys to look life-like. In that sense, it was a great choice to kick off computer animation with a film about toys. But there are some human characters in the film, and they are horrifying-they look really, really creepy, they don't move naturally. The faultiness of the animation really brings it down for me, and it's kind of ironic because they needed to make the movie to push the technology forward, but the technology wasn't really at a point where it could make a satisfying movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Pixar's first full length movie.,"This was the first Pixar movie I've seen. I remember seeing it back 10 years ago, back when it was new. Back then Pixar wasn't too well known in the world. This movie made their intro and beginning of their long line of great movies.Not only was it Pixar's first movie, but it was also the first ever CGI Movie ever made. Back then I didn't know what CGI was so I didn't had a clue how they even made the movie itself(I was only 7 when I first watched it in theaters).The story to this movie is unlike anything you've seen before. It all has to do with what do Toys do when no one is around to play with them. It features memorable characters and some existing toys like ""Little Tykes, Mr. Potatoe Head, Slinky, Barrel of monkeys, etc."" The main character is Woody a classic Cowboy doll who is the favorite toy of Andy, a kind and good boy. He gets respect and pride from the other toys. Life seems good for him.Till one day on Andy's Birthday, he receives a special toy that any boy would want a ""Buzz Lightyear"" action figure. Who has cool features that not even Woody has. And Woody fears Buzz will be Andy's new favorite toy and lose his respect and pride with the other toys.Toy story has some laughs, excitement, and great visuals for a Well done CGI movie. Every Animation lover should see this movie. If you like this movie, you'll like the sequel even more.I give it an 8/10 perfect movie for the whole family to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
a Pixar classic and one of the best family movies of all time,"Tom Hanks and Tim Allen put their talents at voice acting to work and they do it with thorough and complete perfection in ""Toy Story"" a Pixar animated classic film that even now, over ten years since its theatrical debut, continues to be loved by audiences of all ages. It retells the child's dream of their inanimate toys suddenly coming to life whenever a human is not around. All of the toys have personalities and they are even organized as their own society.Tom Hanks plays the voice of Woody, a cowboy doll with a pull string and Tim Allen provides the voice of Buzz Lightyear, a new action figure toy that has crushed all other toys at the market--but the thing is, Buzz believes he is really THE character he represents and not an Asian-made product. Among them there are other toys such as Slinky Dog, voiced by Jim Varney, Rex the dinosaur (Wallace Shawn) and Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles). All of the voices are done well and creates the illusion of real talking characters instead of actors providing voices and then having animators synchronize their 3D models with the prerecorded sounds.Now that I am older, I appreciate and cherish ""Toy Story"" and its successful sequel ""Toy Story 2"" (1999) even more than I did when I first saw them as a kid. I now appreciate the character elements, can understand the point of the jokes better, and respect the talents and efforts of the filmmakers who made this movie possible. I recommend both ""Toy Story"" and its sequel as two of Pixar's best films and some of the best family movies of all time. Children will adore and love it, adults will laugh.

Classic Pixar! This is what future Pixar films should be like!,"Remember the original Pixar movies? Remember when Pixar didn't have stereotypical surfers and rappers? It was when the characters were fun and familiar. They didn't waste out time with farting jokes, but instead had smart jokes that weren't overdone. (even if they were more geared towards adults.) Luckily, we still have one good, classic Pixar movie; Toy Story. Peter Doctor knows how to make a fun and enjoyable family movie.Woody, is the ""top toy"" of Andy's bedroom. He leads meeting and events, and is one of the most popular toys there. But, then, Andy has a birthday party. Everybody is worried about getting replaced by a toy, but Woody assures them that there is nothing to be worried about. Funny, how he ends up getting replaced by Buzz Lightyear-the new popular toy. Ironic, huh? So, he gets jealous and tries to kill Buzz, by setting up a trap and pushing him out the window. Then, the other toys find out, and think ""Let's kill Woody!"" Wow, the irony in it all! The only way the toys will forgive him, is if he brings Buzz back. So, Woody and Buzz meet up at ""Pizza Palace."" After exploring a bit, they get caught by Sid-the sick and twisted kid next door.But, what makes this movie so good? Toy Story isn't your average kids' film. It seems to have a message in it all. Two unlikely friends, Buzz and Woody hate each other at first. Then, they slowly learn trust each other, and stick together through thick and thin.Toy Story is perhaps one of those ""feel good"" movies. It's fun, and doesn't try to be anything it's not.

Unpopular Opinion Time,"Toy Story was a breakthrough movie in film history. Modern animation and children's story telling would not be where it is today without it and I give it full credit for that. However, I don't think Toy Story has aged well.Toy Story works off the premise that toys come to life when the kids that own them aren't looking. Bloody brilliant. Pure genius. This is the best part about Toy Story. And it has some of the most famous lines in cinema history.However, we spend a very large portion of Toy Story trying to convince Buzz that he is in fact a toy. And very little else happens. It just feels repetitive and very one note. The ""villain"" is supposed to be creepy but comes across lame and weird.The thing that I personally love about this franchise is the amazing set of fully realised side characters. But when I rewatched Toy Story, I discovered that they really do not play a part at all in this movie. Rex, Ham, Mr Potato Head, Slinky, barely show up and that really disappointed me.Overall, Toy Story is good and is a really enjoyable family film. However, the newer instalments are the real draw to Pixar.",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Everyone Loves Toys,"Until the Disney-Pixar collaboration that produced this wonderful film, movies were pretty much lopped into two basic categories: child & adult. Children would be lost, bored, terrified, or scarred by the adult fare, while adults would be lost, bored, and uncomfortable at the kiddie flicks. Fortunately, ""Toy Story"" changed everything.For a basic plot summary, this all-CGI film focuses on the childhood toys of young Andy. At first, Andy is in his ""cowboy stage"", and so western doll Woody (Tom Hanks) is his prized possession. However, once Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) arrives via an extra-special birthday present, things begin to change inside the toybox, as the two begin a battle for supremacy over young Andy.There are two main areas in which this movie succeeds so brilliantly: First, it is incredible eye- candy for children. Running the gamut from every type of toy and crazy situation imaginable, this film enraptures the kiddies and will have them watching over and over.Second, it works because you will be watching it over and over with them! As you marvel at the CGI effects, you will also be laughing at the hilarious jokes that, while going right over your kid's head, will make you burst into laughter. This is mainly accomplished by the cast of ""supporting"" characters such as the wise-cracking Hamm (John Ratzenberger), the cowardly dinosaur Rex (Wallace Shawn), the loyal dog Slink (Jim Varney), and the ever-sardonic Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles). Their jokes and humorous situations will make it feel as if you aren't watching a kids movie at all.Also, though the technology has come a long way even since this film's 1995 release date, it is still no less of a filmmaking marvel. For perhaps the first time in cinema history, computer- animation actually made you feel as if you were watching a ""real"" film, not just a cheap special- effects bonanza.Overall, ""Toy Story"" is one of the most influential films ever produced for its ability to blur the lines between children and adult cinema. For the first time, parents were truly able to enjoy a movie with their children.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Can it be ten years already?,"PIXAR animation was but an experimental animation company that had a track record of short film contributions to film festivals when Disney invested in and ultimately released their first project,Toy Story. I figured Disney probably had a good feeling about this one,but I'm not sure they anticipated the kind of groundbreaking swell of animation this would shepherd in.The concept is a fitfully simple and cute one: when kids are away,their toys take on personalities and lives of their own,plotting,planning,bickering,reacting,flirting,etc. In this particular den of toys, a Cowboy Woody doll(voiced by Tom Hanks) is the leader,flanked by a Slinky dog(Jim Varney),green toy soldiers(aptly casted R.Lee Ermey as their platoon leader),a Mr.Potato head(Don Rickles), a Piggy bank(John Ratzenberger,forever Cliff Claven from ""Cheers"") and a Bo Peep doll(Annie Potts). Into the mix is a new,electronic Buzz Lightyear action figure(Tim Allen,who probably does the best voice acting of the bunch here),who almost instantly wows the locals and stirs jealousy from Woody.With music from Randy Newmann--a personal fave of mine--this movie's colors,attention to detail and wry humor make it easily adaptable to kids and adults alike.

That's exactly the kind of creativity that can come about from knowing your own limitations.And other than the animation, this film has aged perfectly, and I think it always will too.

To Infinty and Beyond!,"Like Snow White forever changed animation in 1937 by becoming the world's first animated film and Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988 (the world's first successful combination of animation and live-action) in 1995 Disney once again left their mark in animation history by giving us Toy Story: the world's first fully computer animated film. Toy Story is about a boy named Andy who, like most of us, had many toys as a kid, but there was always that one special toy that we just played with all the time. For him, it was cowboy Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks from ""Big"", ""Apollo 13"", ""Saving Private Ryan"") who feels he'll never be replaced. That all changes on Andy's birthday when he gets a cool spaceman toy, Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen, from the hit 90's sitcom ""Home Improvement"") and all of a sudden, Buzz is his new favorite toy.

A milestone,"People who aren't old enough to remember the '90s don't realise how much of a cultural touchstone certain films were. Everybody saw ""Jurassic Park"" at the movies more than once. Ditto ""The Lion King"". People could quote ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"" without even having seen either movie because of the brand they left on pop culture.In some ways ""Toy Story"" might be the most revolutionary flick of the '90s. It is the first full-length CGI film. It marked the ascendancy of 3D-animation over 2D in film in the same way that ""The Jazz Singer"" showed the world that silent films would soon be replaced by talkies.Here's the point that matters the most for us, though: ""The Jazz Singer"" is only really remembered for its technical achievement in sound, if at all. If it weren't the first talking picture, it'd be forgotten about. ""Toy Story"", on the other hand, is remembered, simply, because it is brilliant.The movie is nothing but pure creativity and visual invention for its whole length. You can feel the influence of the old (even at the time) Warner Brothers cartoons with constant sight gags, and the quirky, lovable individuality of each character.The filmmakers also use feature film length to craft some incredibly beautiful, heartwarming moments into the story. The characters are not perfect, and at times even appear unlikeable. But the movie makes them so ironically human that when they redeem themselves you only love them more.The movie also evinces genuine heart-ache and surprising poignancy. The scene where Woody and Buzz realise that the deformed toys in the villain's room are actually not to be feared, that they're good hearted creatures just like the two of them despite what they've been through and what they look like: I thought that was beautiful in '95 age ten, and I thought it was beautiful now. And the villain, Sid's, long-suffering younger sister, just a sweet girl who has to live with her older brother's cruelty? I wanted to hug her, polygons be damned.Here's something else that's amazing about ""Toy Story"": I thought that the world's first CGI animated full-length movie, which is now almost thirty years old (!), would look a little dated, like the earliest cartoons do. It doesn't look dated at all. I don't know how they pulled that off.For all ""Toy Story""'s stunning technical achievements, for its somehow also reaching new heights in cartoon storytelling, for it accessing feelings in us we never thought it would bring out, I haven't mentioned what might have been the biggest revelation ""Toy Story"", and Pixar, brought us in the '90s. That is, the fact that a movie for kids has no reason to not be just as beloved by adults as any child. Gone were the days when adults suffered through kids' movies waiting for them to end. Pixar realised that the themes and lessons in their movies were just as valuable to the older generation as to the young. What children needed to be encouraged to remember, adults needed to be reminded. And in being reminded, ""Toy Story"", and all the other brilliant Pixar works that followed it, reminded us that childhood is never really gone, the child we were is still with us, needing to be loved and celebrated.Is ""Toy Story"" the best movie of the '90s? It's certainly way up there.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A new mark in history..,This movie was truly amazing the first time I seen it. It is a truly captivating picture. It was the 1st 3D movie of its time and brought many kids to see it. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen just made the movie even better with the toy that didn't want to let go and his owner to like the new toy on the block. It is very touching and as a kid I could not get enough of this movie. I can watch about 10 times in a row and mostly anyone else can. It will stay with me forever so i recommend this movie to anyone who wants there kids to watch or if you just want to watch a great family movie thats fun for every one. I give this movie an outstanding 10 out of 10.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

A Triumph For Disney!,"""Toy Story"" has been said to be the first great fully computer animated feature ever.  And I must agree.  Computer animation has been used before, in movies like ""Tron.""  But only in ""Toy Story"" has it been used with such great effect.  Seeing animation like this is impressive.  Truly cinematic history was made with this movie!  The technology may be improving past the level it had achieved when ""Toy Story"" was made.  But you just can't forget this milestone!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

To infinity and beyond.,"What do toys do when kids stop playing with them? Well, 'Toy Story' might provide some answers.As the title indicates - and as you'll see from the characters - 'Toy Story' is definitely more of a kids film. In every sense this is a beautifully animated cartoon kids will love watching over and over again. They will laugh at the antics the toys get up to, they will love the characters that might resemble some of the toys in their own room, and they will enjoy the story. It is a simple, easy to follow premise.Thanks to adding elements of danger and adventure, and themes adults can relate to, the film also has a mature appeal. Thus, 'Toy Story' is perfect for the entire family. But what is this story about? Andy is a young boy who lives in a nice neighbourhood and his favourite toy is a cowboy doll named Woody (who is wonderfully voiced by Tom Hanks). He has several other toys and when Andy is not around, they all come to life and have their own adventures.Then Andy gets a brand new, modern toy for his birthday: Buzz Lightyear - a space action figure. Buzz Lightyear soon becomes Andy's favourite toy, and this sparks jealousy in Woody. But when Woody accidentally knocks Buzz Lightyear out the window, it becomes Woody's mission to save him.There's plenty of action and adventure that follows and 'Toy Story' is sure to entertain kids (and adults!) from beginning to end. Sit back, relax, and see what the toys are up to when you're not watching!",6.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of the best Disney movies out there,"This is a great movie.  Enjoyable for any age, with really smooth computer animation.  If you haven't seen it, by all means, do!

Funny. Adventurous. And Two Really Epic Lead Characters.,"The movie is good and the characters are super cute, and interesting! Especially the two main characters. But I feel like it's a bit overrated, and the reason for that is that when it came out on the big screen there weren't that many animated movies with such good animation, and a lot of people vote from a nostalgic point of view with a high rating rather than a realistic point of view.Great fun is all that's going on, but it doesn't quite outlast classics like The Lion King (1994). I exaggerated because I compared it to THE LION KING. Ok. But the movie THE CARS (2006) is lower rated by 2023 and that's pretty sad because THE CARS is much more interesting...From a kid's point of view, maybe not. I don't know, I don't want to think that much.That's how I see things right now.Final score: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One or two?,"I have no idea which is the best, as depending on my mood either one suits me.

Still Entertaining after 15 Years,"I saw Toy Story in theaters in 95. As a kid it was funny, and original not just in story but in presentation.After 15 years the cg doesn't hold up in all areas. The human characters look stiff and the way background looks a bit flat. This plastic look works with toys so it doesn't become a problem.The movie holds up in every other area. The plot is engaging and the characters funny and likable.Toy Story is a family film it funny for children without talking down to them and enjoyable for adults.As a twenty something year old it is just as entertaining as when I first saw the original release.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Perfect time to panic,"This is about getting older and losing status dealing with a new generation that wants to do things completely differently, through the metaphor of favorite toys, representing how the Western was overtaken by the sci-fi movie.I like that there are jokes for both the little ones and the adults. Puns and other verbal comedy. When it means to be tense and/or exciting, it legitimately does succeed. I really appreciate that the female characters are depicted as having emotional intelligence and compassion. All the toys have different personalities, some in contrast to the one one would guess - the T-Rex has anxiety, and can't yet roar in a scary way. Of course a lot of one-digit-agers love the idea of their toys being alive. I personally am grateful for this movie leading to the Army Men game series, since I greatly enjoyed the first two and some of the spin-offs.I've never been a fan of the fact that Sid is supposed to be the bad guy when he's just really creative. He doesn't know that the toys are alive, that he's torturing living things. Also based on the fact that he wears a black shirt with skull logo on it, he is either the Punisher as a teen, or a fan of the character, either way, awesome. His monsters are by far the coolest thing about the movie. I respect any kid's movie that is willing to admit that they can handle at least some horror. He's even nice enough to fix his sister's doll! I do appreciate the message of acceptance of those who are different that it does ultimately lead to. I agree with the interpretation that this film is about slavery, and I appreciate that the sequels help correct the issues that it brings up for this one - not sure anyone is gonna watch just one of these today.I've seen a number of people criticize the Randy Newman score, how it's literally spelling out what we're supposed to take away from the songs in the lyrics, so this is of course the part of the review where I would put it if I disagreed with that. As a matter of fact it would be this exact sentence that would express that.Overall, I definitely prefer Small Soldiers. I recommend this to everyone. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Simply, the best animated film of them all.","Disney used to be good, wholesome family entertainment that was not only clean but fun. Now, most everything they put out is outdated postmodern trash that portrays all children as geniuses able to rule the world and all parents as evil minions trying to keep their children from having fun. Thank God for Pixar coming to existence. Starting with Toy Story in 1995, they made a great family film that appeals to adult humor as well as children. They haven't failed since. They can do no wrong it seems, and I pray it continues that way. Of all their great films, this is undoubtedly in my mind the best of them all. It is also arguably better than any animated film Disney ever did, including the classics of the 1940s and 50s. The premise is so clever and daring in that it could go wrong in so many ways. It never does, though, and in a mere 82 minutes, it covers more information than many other 2 hour films. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen have become iconic in their roles as Woody and Buzz. The animation and dialogue is so good it is as if they are really on screen arguing with one another. The supporting characters are also very good and funny. With animation, perhaps the most important aspect is the voice characters. Pixar has done a great job of not always going with a star to do the voices, but rather simply going with the one that fits the character best. Overall, Toy Story is superb film-making with a great script, wonderful voices and animation that still impresses despite all the technological improvements. Thank you, Pixar. I am truly grateful to you for saving animated films.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Cool,"Toy Story (1995) is a pioneering animated film that earns a 6/10 for its innovative yet somewhat uneven execution. The voice acting by Tom Hanks and Tim Allen is charming and brings Woody and Buzz Lightyear to life with memorable personality. The early CGI animation was groundbreaking, though it shows its age compared to modern standards. The story is imaginative and enjoyable, but it occasionally feels simplistic and predictable. The soundtrack, with Randy Newman's score, adds a whimsical touch, though it doesn't leave a lasting impression.

A Disney Classic,"Toy Story isn't just a movie; it's a groundbreaking cinematic masterpiece that revolutionized animation and storytelling, leaving an indelible mark on the hearts of audiences worldwide.Pixar's inaugural feature film introduces us to a world where toys come to life when humans aren't around, and the narrative unfolds through the eyes of Woody, the cowboy doll voiced by Tom Hanks, and Buzz Lightyear, the space ranger voiced by Tim Allen. The brilliance of the film lies not just in its imaginative premise but in the emotional depth woven into the story.The characters are brought to life with such charm and personality that they transcend their inanimate status. Woody's journey from the beloved favorite to grappling with insecurities and the arrival of the flashy Buzz Lightyear provides a poignant exploration of friendship and identity. Buzz's journey of self-discovery, realizing he's a toy in a world much bigger than his Space Ranger delusions, is both humorous and touching.The voice acting, led by Hanks and Allen, is pitch-perfect, infusing the characters with nuance and authenticity. Their chemistry becomes the heartbeat of the film, creating a dynamic that's both heartwarming and hilarious.The animation, although now surpassed by newer technologies, was groundbreaking for its time. The attention to detail, the expressive character animations, and the imaginative world-building set a standard for animated films that many strive to achieve.Beyond the visual spectacle, Toy Story excels in its storytelling. The script, co-written by Pixar's creative geniuses, crafts a narrative that appeals to all ages. It tackles themes of friendship, loyalty, and the fear of being replaced with a deftness that elicits both laughter and tears.Randy Newman's iconic soundtrack adds another layer of emotion to the film, with the timeless ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" becoming synonymous with the enduring legacy of Toy Story.What truly makes this movie stand the test of time is its universal appeal. It captures the essence of childhood wonder and the bittersweet reality of growing up. The film doesn't just entertain; it resonates with its audience on a deeply emotional level.In conclusion, this isn't merely a movie; it's a cultural touchstone, a nostalgic trip for adults, and an enchanting experience for new generations. Its influence reverberates throughout the animation industry, and its characters have become beloved icons. The film's ability to blend cutting-edge animation with a heartfelt, timeless story makes it a cinematic gem that continues to enchant audiences, proving that, indeed, toys have a special place in our hearts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Three-Dimensional Masterpiece with a Special Effect in our Hearts :,"Almost 20 years have passed since the nineties  Now, we are so familiar with the cell- phones, Facebook and the Internet that we're totally amnesic regarding these years where we had none, and we all scratch our heads wondering how communication was even possible back then. Not too surprisingly, the same reasoning can be applied for animation: we're so used to CGI and 3D animated films that we forgot how groundbreaking Walt Disney's ""Toy Story"" was in 1995, and that we witnessed an event as historical as the release of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". It's not surprising, by the way, that the two films are the only animated features included in the American Film Institute's Top 100 List.The comparison with ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" doesn't only rely on the technical achievement and the critical recognition, but also on what drove these two crucial aspects: an endearing and universally appealing story. ""Snow White"" exploited all the comical possibilities of the dwarfs, in order to use physically distinct characters with different personalities attributed to each of them, while the Queen and Snow White could be modeled in more realistic designs; the setting also allowed the drawers to extend their talents and give it the touch of magic and escapism the audiences needed back then. ""Toy Story"" does the exact same thing, it chooses the best setting that can justify a clever and playful use of three-dimensionality, by creating a sort of underworld made of different forms and colors, a world where toys come to life when the owner is absent. This choice is a strike of genius because it provides an escapist value in our own environment, Disney made enough movies set in forests, mountains, jungles, so for its first 3D film, we have the first in-door Disney film, which gives an irresistible feeling of intimacy.This simplicity is the perfect counterpart to the complexity of special effects and the creativity of the screenplay because it also succeeds to add a little touch of nostalgia and hit a sensitive chord by waking the inner child inside of us. In 1995, we're in the midst of Disney Renaissance and its streak of successful films was so full of adventures and romance, thrills and laughs that ""Toy Story"" almost resonates as a comeback to the roots of the Walt Disney Company, childhood. Haven't we all played with toys when we were kids, whether they were dolls, Smurfs figurines, cars, monsters, haven't we all used our hands, totally invisible for our little eyes, and talked instead of characters, like magical puppeteers, imagining them sliding from a ravine that was our bathtub, or escalating a mountain, the bed-pillow. Toys were always alive for us, because our games were precisely what brought them to life, and in ""Toy Story"", we always have the feeling that the creators are less 'making a film' than playing with toys like we used to do, engaging a tacit complicity with the kids in the audience, and the inner kids within the adults from the audience.""Toy Story"" assumes that toys are alive, and the script is so well written that we're immediately convinced. There's no way Woody, the cowboy doll with Tom Hanks' voice couldn't be alive, that the cocky Buzz Lightyear is only a 3D talking image, that Mr. Potato Head isn't that grouchy figurine or that the Tyrannosaurus isn't that cute andcoward creature, all the toys that belong to little Andy incarnate Disney's magical power, bringing things to life, and we realize how we all had a Disney inside us when we were playing with our toys. And ""Toy Story"" couldn't have a more appropriate villain than a kid who destroyed toys, Sid: a character I despised so much because I was definitely not a Sid when I was younger. ""Toy Story"" is an odyssey in the world of toys after which we don't look at them the same way, calling them objects is almost insulting. Indeed, I've always felt guilty because as a teen, my mother told me to get rid of my toys, to give them to needier boys, and although I didn't play with them anymore, I remember how painful it was to say them goodbye, after ""Toy Story"", now I feel better with myself.And ""Toy Story"" doesn't just take its creativity and the cuteness of its characters for granted, there are the lines, the humor, but the story too, starting with the antagonism between the two 'lead' toys. Woody is jealous because Buzz, Andy's new birthday gift, became his best friend, in other words, his favorite toy, while Buzz doesn't know he's only a toy and lives in total denial about his true nature, which adds an unexpected bit of poignancy to characters that are not just three-dimensional on a geometrical level. The film has its share of action, mostly with the Buzz and Woody's duo trying to get back to Andy's house before the family moves in, but the emotional core of the film is their friendship. And progressively, their journey will allow them to understand the value of a toy, illustrated by Newman's Oscar-nominated song ""You've Got a Friend in Me""; there would still be room for Woody in Andy's heart and there's an inner nobility in toys in the way they bring happiness during our most treasured memories.'Toy Story"" is a beautiful friendship story between two lovable toys, (have you noticed that Buzz and Woody makes buddy if you associate them), whose friendship culminate at the moment where both 'fall with style' in Andy's box. And I guess this is why we hardly remember how groundbreaking ""Toy Story"" was, maybe we just forgot about the special effects and the whole 3D thing, and simply remember the beauty of the story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Classic Tale Full of Imagination,"Toy Story (1995)*** 1/2 (out of 4)A kid's toy room is split after his former favorite toy Woody (Tom Hanks) gets replaced with the newest sensation Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). The gunslinger Woody can't except the fact that he's no longer the kid's favorite so he and Buzz end up outside of the house and must try and find a way back. The Pixar form of animation has become the standard today so I'm sure many people watching these films forget how groundbreaking this movie was when it was first released. I was only fifteen at the time but giving it a second viewing after all these years just reminds me at why this thing became a hit. Not only is the animation beautiful and extremely life like but we also got a terrific screenplay that certainly brings these characters to life and really makes them something special. The idea of a film being centered on toys that come to life when no one is looking is something so simple yet so genius that you can't help but wonder why it took someone so long to do a film. The screenplay is without question one of the best ever written for an animation movie as all of the characters, from Woody and Buzz to Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles) and Slinky Dog (Jim Varney) are perfectly brought to life. The child-like nature of the story has so much energy that you can't help but smile at each journey that the toys find themselves on. The amount of imagination in the screenplay is what makes it so special because it really does seem like something a kid would come up with while playing alone in his room with the toys. Everyone can remember what it was like being a kid and playing with these toys and bringing them to life in our minds so to see that played out on the screen is certainly something special. The film has terrific laughs but also a nice message. The voice work is terrific with Hanks and Allen clearly leading the way but that Southern draw of Varney is special as well.

They will fight for the affection of a child from the moment that Buzz is offered to him as a gift, threatening Woody's place as his favorite toy. A rivalry that will lead to a strong friendship between them. Directed by John Lasseter, one of the brightest minds of Pixar Studios, the film features the voices of Tom Hanks (as Woody) and Tim Allen (as Buzz) for the main characters.This was the film that launched Pixar to success, in a journey that still goes and deserves the respect of all admirers of the seventh art. The story of this film is deeply moving, not only to focus on strong themes like loyalty and friendship but, mainly, because it mess with our fondest memories by involving toys that we all played when we were kids. Its not a coincidence that we see, in this film, toys of our parents and grandparents living with action figures and games of our time. This film tries to touch everyone, from the small audience to the adults who take them to the movies. It's a great movie for the family and it's still current today, twenty years after his premiere.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The pioneer of animation movies.,"This was the movie that started it all for the world of animation. This was the pioneer. Now we all know that when we see a pixar movie ( especially one with the likes of john lassetter involved in it) that we are in for a cinematic experience.This movie fulfills every child's dream. Haven't you ever wondered what your toys do when you aren't there. I know I did when I was a kid, I myself had a buzz lightyear doll and I always imagined him having that Tim Allen voice.not only does it fulfill the child's dream, but there is a ton of easter eggs that pixar has included that will keep the teenagers and adults interested and laughing as well. Even 16 years after the original release date I still watch the movie and I am still finding little subliminal messages (easter eggs) that pixar has included.Disney/ pixar headed by john lassetter do a great job in making an unbelievable movie seem as believable as possible. Just for a second forget that these are toys we are talking about here and imagine that they are real people. Would they have acted any different to how they did? Knowing that what the characters did and how they reacted and how it is on unreasonable to consider that they might act that way is the key to good script writing and good storytelling. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen also do a marvellous job at heading the cast making every line seem funnier or more dramatic than it actually is.Overall i would not just recommend this, this is a MUST SEE for any kid or adult. If you have not seen this what have you been living in a cave? go out there and rent it or buy it NOW.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Amazing film,I love this film its been with me through all of my childhood and even though I'm nearly an adult I still love the film I really like the chemistry and the bond of the characters bottom Woody and I like that Woody has a lot of personality he's really funny and bosses also funny cause he's a bit of a daredevil and there's some really funny moments in there probably one of my favourite films ever this film I find that this the play the boy called Sid is naughty but he's really funny and I like that he tries to kill the toys I found really funny I would rate this ages five and upwards.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"As Buzz falls with style, we fall wholesale for this animated classic.","Toy Story is directed by John Lasseter who also co-writes the story with a whole host of other people! It features the voices of Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, Jim Varney, Annie Potts, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger and Laurie Metcalfe. Music is by Randy Newman.The first feature-length film animated entirely by computer, there's not a lot that can be said now that hasn't been said before about Toy Story, both as a film of heart and substance, and as regards its importance in the world of animation. Two further sequels would follow, both enormously successful and both equally as enjoyable. But it began here in 95, where Woody, Buzz and the gang operated on a level that beguiled the children whilst simultaneously bringing knowing laughs to the accompanying adults. Pixar paint a vivid colourful world, bringing us down to the toys level and etching in emotive threads about jealousies, friendships, neuroses' and the relationship between a child and his toys, while youthful splendour bathes the film constantly. Even though the plot is simple in terms of ambition, the characterisations are substantial and the film never panders to political correctness. The voice work of the actors is terrific, especially Hanks and Allen as Woody and Buzz respectively, their vocal comedy ticks wonderfully bring life to the animated figures, while Newman adds his optimistic tunes into the mix.Never maudlin or cheesy with its messages and sombre moments (something some other Disney films can't lay claim too), Toy Story's only crime is being too short at an hour and fifteen minutes (both subsequent sequels would rectify this issue). But it's a small complaint, probably (in my case) born out by greed for a longer adventure involving these marvellous creations. This was the start of a beautiful friendship for many, up there on the screen, and here in our own lives, thank you Pixar, you knocked it out of the park with this one, a film for all that keeps on giving delights with each subsequent revisit. 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story,"It's amazing how this movie has changed over the years. How the once amazing graphics have aged and really don't hold up is the obvious thing but there's more than that.When I was younger, Sid was just the monster next door but watching it now I can't help but notice how the movie is (inadvertently) commenting on the impact parents have on their children. Andy's mom always being there, loving and supporting while Sid is literally blowing things up and his dad just sleeps in his recliner in a tucked away room.Then there's Woody, the cowboy that made us all fall in love with Pixar. To see him now... Woody is a jerk. He's self involved, selfish and even violent all because he's no longer the favorite.But that is the brilliance of Pixar. 19 years later, the visuals may have waned but the story complexities have matured like a fine wine proving that they have always understood how to make movies for children and adults alike.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Still Looks Good 25 Years Later,"If you had a TV as a kid you've probably watched Toy Story but have you ever sat and thought about how revolutionary this film is? The human faces are pretty dated but not so bad that you can't forgive it, given it's age. Woody and the rest of the toys have very good designs that you can't notice the age because of how old you are when you watched this movie for the first time they still hold up this is probably the third best Toy Story film in the franchise I think 4 was worse but 2 and 3 both stood out. I'd say 4,1,3,2 as the order of Toy Story films if I were to rank them, all of them are still A movies guaranteed. Feel free to disagree. The plot was easy enough for a 7 year old to grasp but still endearing after all these years.

A film that will last for infinity and beyond,This film will continue to delight children for many years to come and will truly last the test of time because of it's simple story and bright and interesting characters.This was probably one of the first family films that adults could really enjoy as well and it is a testament to Disney and Pixar that other companies have tried to do this in their own films.The voice cast is fantastic and it is great that they all returned for the 1999 sequel as well as the soon to be released third film.Overall this was one of the main films of my childhood and I still enjoy it very much today.

To the infinity and beyond!!,"Pixar's first major smash hit and one of the first entirely computer animated films may not have aged well, considering the huge steps CGI characters have taken since 1995. Its biggest assets, a huge beating heart and a great sense of humor, still work so many years later and let you forget about the sometimes flat textures. The story, the characters and the jokes are what draws you into the story and soon after you forget you're actually watching an adventure about living toys. The great voice acting helps too, of course. The result, a glorious collection of exciting and fun action scenes, is so perfect, you sometimes feel the urge to clap applause in responds to the events on the screen. The voice cast of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen fit the characters of Woody and Buzz so perfectly, this film should be seen as a major highlight in their careers. From Pizza Planet, to Sid's House and the race for the moving truck, this film features plenty of memorable scenes and locations. Randy Newman's song ""You've Got A Friend In Me"" is undeniably one of the best songs to be featured in a Pixar film, shame it didn't win the Oscar for 'Best Original Song' that it deserved.

The rest of the toys are voiced by great voice actors like Wallce Shawn as Rex or Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head.I especially like what the toys do when the humans are not around, and they can be worried about being replaced by a new toy.

"Stunning animation, but the story was a bit lacking","Toy Story is the first movie made with computers and not using real-life actors. This means that the movie is STUNNING to look at, and worth seeing just for that. However, the story is a bit average, when compared to the likes the classics Pinnochio and Snow White.

While the animation is groundbreaking to say the least, it doesn't mean that it has a story to back it up.  I for one love cartoon movies, but this left a sour taste in  my mouth.  Maybe it's because in what is supposed to be a kids' movie, we see one character trying to ""off"" another character, out of pure jealousy.  The other toys were just annoying as the chorus, as they, like the leads, had a total lack of any real character.  There were some bad attempts at humor that didn't even win a giggle out of me or my family.Skip it and see Shrek or Ice Age.

Pixar's feature beginnings,"Pixar became a household name in 1995 with ""Toy Story"", about cowboy Woody (Tom Hanks) and his rival, spaceman Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), who have to rely on each other's abilities and intuition to survive a snafu.I guess that this wasn't a masterpiece in the general sense of the word, but it's impressive nonetheless (who would have guessed that Don Rickles and Wallace Shawn would ever do voices in a cartoon?). And it of course set the stage for Pixar and Disney to collaborate on well done computer animated features in the years to come: ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Finding Nemo"".I should identify that although this is G-rated, one of Mr. Potato Head's lines is not exactly G-rated (hint: it deals with a laser).

"The funniest, most creative, and most intelligent family film ever","Being a monumental achievement in modern film-making, ""Toy Story"" also proves to be the greatest family film I have ever seen. It is truly a brilliant concept. Young Andy's cowboy doll Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks) becomes jealous when Andy starts paying more attention to his new space toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). Buzz, however, does not grasp the fact that he's actually a toy and thinks he is a space ranger here by mistake. Hanks and Allen are the perfect voices for these characters, as are Don Rickles, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger, and numerous others. There are more great one-liners in this film than any other family film I can recall, one of the best being Buzz's ""I don't believe that man's ever been to medical school."" I have seen this film countless times, and it has become a true classic. It's masterfully done, not only being the first fully computer animated film, but also for it's superb writing and concept. Everything about the film, from the staff meeting scene in the beginning to Buzz seeing his TV ad, is perfectly done. Randy Newman's three original songs are all excellent. ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" lost to Pochahontas' ""Colors of the Wind,"" which I also love, but I'm not sure which was better; maybe this. Anyway, see this film.

Why The First Toy Story Is My Favorite,"So far they have come out with 3 Toy Story movies, and I also saw like a spooky Toy Story movie at RedBox and thought I heard that they are going to make a 4th one. It's interesting to think how this movie is from 1995 and was like the first fully computer animated movie, while nowadays almost all the animated movies we see are computer animated rather than the old days when they were digitally animated drawings. I miss those old cartoon movies. Anyway, Toy Story is definitely a classic movie. Kids today can watch the movie, and it probably won't seem like an old movie to them. They have made other Toy Story movies which seemed to earn more money than the first one. But, I will talk about why the first one is the best. The first one introduced us to the Toys in Toy Story, yeah they add some new toys in the later films, but this one is the first real introduction. It's always nice to remember the introduction of the characters we are familiar with in later films. Also, the later films seem to be more about adventures from the toys we know together in a group, in this movie it was mostly just the adventure of our favorite toys, Woody and Buzz. We see Woody's reaction to having Buzz as the new popular toy. Also, this one seems more about survival for Woody and Buzz, while in the other Toy Story movies it seems like it's less about survival and more about getting back to where they belong. Another reason to like this movie, from what I know while Pizza Planet is mentioned in other Pixar movies, this is the only one which shows them inside a Pizza Planet. I've always thought, that restaurant would be really cool to be at if it were a real restaurant. About Pizza Planet, I remember way back in 6th Grade in the scene when we see the Pizza Planet pick-up truck at the gas station and we hear the guys in it ask for directions to Pizza Planet, somebody in the classroom asked the teacher why would somebody who worked at Pizza Planet be asking for directions on how to get there? My teacher didn't know how to answer. In this movie we get to know Andy's original house and his neighborhood. We get to know the villain in this movie, Sid. The villains in the other movies are like the Chicken Man, Stinky Pete, and Lotso and some of his gang. I'm sure most of us could agree that our favorite bad guy in these Toy Story movies is Sid and let me give a few reasons to why we might like him the best. For one, Sid is Andy's next door neighbor. What's weird is the movie doesn't give any indication of whether Andy and Sid knew each other, so it can leave us with that question. Sid isn't like a bad guy, I mean he plays in the movie as a bad guy, but he seems to play a character we could imagine his age. I mean about a 13 year old boy who wears a T Shirt with a skeleton. He's aggressive and he likes torturing toys as a hobby of his, obviously not aware that the toys are alive. He likes explosives and stuff, and has a dark atmosphere in his room, along with mostly keeping his room locked. So, he's a G rated version of an early adolescent character who is supposed to be like the bad guy and he doesn't swear, talk about alcohol, drugs, or sex. He isn't like a criminal, just a scary kid with a dark atmosphere who likes to be the bad guy to toys he doesn't realize are alive. The climax in this movie also seems more exciting than the climax in the other movies. One thing we can find hard to believe, is how the toys have all these wacky adventures, doing things that somebody could easily notice, and nobody seems to be aware that the Toys are alive. Toy Story doesn't seem like The Velveteen Rabbit, but more like Toys who are having their own adventures, a little like The Lego Movie, where the Toys seem more alive than they seem like Toys. This is a great movie, I'd give a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

There is no way we cannot mention the magic made by 3D artists without including Toy Story. Animation is many things, for many people, times and contexts. Launched in 1995, this production became, for example, the first fully animated by computer.Rather than trying to amaze your audience with just its innovative look - for the time - ""Toy Story"" focuses on winning the audience over its characters. Let us start with its protagonists. Despite looking like just another good-natured character at first, Woody becomes increasingly complex as the film goes on, feeling not only jealous of Buzz, but also with a real fear of being left out by the one he saw as his most loyal companion. A scene that marks in a very simple but effective way, this affection is immediately in the opening credits, when Woody ""falls"" beside Andy on the sofa. In this first film, Woody is a character with a rather complicated bow, who could easily transform the wooden cowboy into a figure that children would be disgusted by because of their attitudes. Thanks to the sensitivity of the filmmakers, we understand his actions and accompany his emotional growth.Buzz, on the other hand, suffers from a problem that prevents him from determining within his reality. Believing himself to be a space hero, his naiveté and innocence in his belief manage to maximize the anger that Woody feels when he sees the astronaut so casually stealing an affection that he so cherished. Like Woody, Buzz ""loses"" something in the course of the film, a loss perhaps deeper than that of the sheriff. There is still a historical element in the relationship of the two, after all it is a fact that in the American children's imagination, there was really a replacement of cowboys by astronauts, during the space race.The supporting actors also steal the show, all with very striking personalities and visuals. The acid Mr. Potato Head is the highlight of this troupe, simply priceless, always with a sarcastic comment at the tip of his non-existent language. The neurotic dinosaur Rex also gets a good laugh. The Slinky spring dog and Pig work very well as ""stairs"", with their interaction together being excellent, while Sergeant and his soldiers play a small, but anthological, action scene. It is also impossible not to mention the disfigured toys in Sid's room, which have a great participation and a very interesting look. As a matter of fact, the little villain and his kind sister Hannah end up being the best-developed human characters in history, especially Sid. It is funny that the audience can barely get to know Andy, but that he gets so much into the crazy psyche of the young pyromaniac.The merits of the film directed by John Lasseter are many. In addition to being a beautiful work (debut of the partnership between Disney and Pixar), with a well-designed script, charismatic characters and adventure in the right measure, it opened doors to several other good productions. If it weren't for Woody and Buzz, we might not have seen (the way they got to our eyes, at least) Antz (1998), Shrek (2001), Finding Nemo (2003) and Ratatouille (2007), among so many others. In addition to the impressive look for the time, what draws the most attention in Toy Story is its plot. Creative and with deep characters, the animation has a story that manages to please children and still interest adults. In fact, this is a characteristic of the vast majority of animations in recent years. This concern with the non-child audience ended up raising the challenge for the screenwriters and turned the stories into a program for the whole family. The feature film directed by John Lasseter is one of the pioneers in this regard.It was essential, therefore, the feature film to be made on computers. Far from these machines being lifeless - as toys are not - there was, however, a lot of passion in the will of Pixar Animation Studios' artists to become pioneers. This is an achievement, consequently, that not only enhances Toy Story in a technical sense, already deserving of awards. On the other hand, the technological revolution in question also magnified animation in other terms: as in the realization of its creation of a world, in itself new, which would originate a sentimental approach between cinema and the public. The enchantment, in turn, does not lie only in the ""superficial"" novelty, because there is value in the content and in an integration between technology and narrative. In terms of deepening a sense of love for all the children who watched the animation, Toy Story fulfills, in this case, an instigating creative proposal - which, by the way, is very original, inviting. The script is concerned, moreover, with using the magical premise not only as a pretext, but as part of a study. It is important for Toy Story, therefore, to understand who these toys are and what their real goals are in the world.The script, moreover, wears patience by not exposing the premise face-to-face, building patiently the mystique and understanding of the dramas that are at stake and that serve a discursive purpose: a creation of a fictional world that resignifies real relationships. This whole ensemble enriches the imaginative sense and the affection of the spectator-children for their dolls and dolls, as well as investing the attention of the animators in a universe that has many layers of verisimilitude. It may even be that part of the target audience does not have many friendships in their daily lives, however, it certainly does in their rooms. Woody's (Tom Hanks) journey, in this case, basically covers his jealousy with the arrival of Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), a toy astronaut who believes he is a real space explorer, but who gets to be played more often by Andy, the owner of both characters. The two are lost and need to return before the boy moves.In the midst of existentialist crises, the protagonists enter trajectories that progressively intensify the love that is at stake. Certain songs, in fact, complement the dramas of the characters. The soundtrack by Randy Newman, who introduced us to classics like ""You've Got a Friend in Me"". Music is crucial in establishing unconditional love between toys and owners. ""Strange Things"" and ""I Will Go Sailing No More"" are striking in this sense. Buzz, in his instance, is about to perceive himself as a fraud, until his mission takes on other meanings, no longer being to protect the galaxies, but to protect the heart of a mere boy. Woody, on the other hand, even without Andy playing with him, needs to be at his disposal when the boy needs it. This magical idea of love above all is very rewarding to the public, although open to some questioning, as it supports a little slave-like thinking. But even so, the argument manages to find a resolution, bringing the antagonist Sid (Erik von Detten) to oppose Andy as a child and, ultimately, to suffer the consequences of his behavior. The moralism builds an imaginary that is powerful enough to impact, without having to be expository or pedagogical. As a promise of an eternal friendship, Toy Story transposes cinematic walls to embrace us, talking to us personally.And like any game, the animation would need to be imaginative, it would need to entertain and also conquer. Of the most exciting adventures that animated cinema has ever presented, Toy Story is, above all, a good story. The necessary events occupy the short duration of the film very quickly, however, never seeming rushed or needing silly solutions to find conclusions. The confrontations that emerge in the course of the narrative sound natural, like Buzz ignoring Woody's calls to enter a spaceship and then be captured by Sid. There is a lot of intelligence in the way the script takes advantage of the dramas, like the enmity that Andy's other toys take from Woody, to rearrange specific scenes. Various possibilities of solutions are emerging for the characters, bringing them closer to their objectives, however, recurrently, a new problem appears to be a barrier to the anticipated success of the mission. When the cowboy is just a window away from his owner's room, for example, a twist in the plot of Buzz Lightyear prevents him from being rescued. The linked events, therefore, exemplify excellent precision in cohesion.The animation, taking into account that it is a film released in 1995, is quite fluid, especially in the action sequences. An absolute highlight in this regard is the climax of the film, with Woody and Buzz racing to reach Andy's moving truck.Certainly, the film does not have the emotional nuances that its sequences would present, but it is extremely rich in establishing the public's empathy with such characters, so that this future becomes a possibility. Each of the supporting actors - who would gain more presence in the narrative at other times - traces a particular personality. Each staff occupies a space in the imaginary. Iconographical, an animation is created that takes from the public's nostalgia with the toys of his past - or those of the present - to recreate his own. The premise is somewhat simple, however, the reinventions in the journey show a creative care that deservedly earned animation an Oscar nomination for Original Screenplay. A technological experiment, a cinematic revolution, an intimate achievement. Toy Story takes on several meanings over the years, however, in the end, the most important thing even lives in the connection that the work establishes with its audience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Good film!,"Good film with the likes of Don Rickles, Jim Varney, John Ratzenberger and Annie Potts. Not to mention the hilarious toy aliens, and the creepy kid Sid. The voice talents aren't the only things worth mentioning, the film has a remarkable story and a truly irreverent script (""I'm from Mattel, actually I'm from a smaller company that was purchased by Mattel in a leveraged buyout"").

Toy Story,"Afraid this doesn't really hold up that well. You hear so much about great wit, but that comes only in short fits, a few good lines here and there. I know they're toys, but the characters in ""Toy Story"" largely suffer from the sort of super-quirk ""Juno"" and ""Little Miss Sunshine"" and the lot suffer from. It's basically really quirky toys talking to each other and facing acts of villainy and committing acts of heroism for an hour and a half. The animation is impressive considering when it was made but unlike hand-drawn animation from the old Disney films it HAS dated, and noticeably, often looking like a video game cutscene now. The voice work is fine, but there's just nothing truly interesting about this world or these characters. It's a pleasant enough movie and occasionally very fun, but the overwhelming affection for it seems to me the result of nostalgia and memory rather than any lasting value. Compared to the rip-roaring adventure of ""The Incredibles"", the spine-tingling melancholy tone and sophisticated ideas of ""WALL-E"", or the sense of longing and loss and adventure in ""Up"", ""Toy Story"" falls short. Very short. In fact, I'd much rather take the small-town nostalgia of ""Cars"" over this. A good starting point for Pixar but nothing even remotely approaching a classic.",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Amazing,"Amazing! I have just seen Toy Story. The first one. For the first time. And it's like I'm seeing it back in the days before Toy Story 2 got out on the big screen. The only thing I wouldn't have known was the future story of Apple Inc.This is a wonderful one hour advertisement where you can see branded toys. The only thing that is original in this one hour waste is the way Steve Jobs' employees created a toy universe. It was so yesterday to create a new line of cheap plastics than do some silly adventure. It was called an adventure so people won't have any issue leaving the children alone for one or two hours of advertisements. It sounds so much more educative to have cartoon adventure instead of having cartoon characters selling you stuff. And, instead of a real actor, the cartoon has precisely zero morals: it can sell plutonium to a 5 year old or to some radical terrorist group without blinking. Unless the art director thinks the blink would raise the quantity at least 10 percent.Now about the creative part. Steve Jobs' employees never bothered to create something like say Hanna-Barbera. They just pushed older toys into this new advertisement. And here's where the creativity ends.What's even better is the world imagined. A world where children are isolated. Where they depend on their branded toys. And watch out for the bad kid! He is real creative. But the toys are working together to bring back what the lower case 'c' in a circle meant: a toy identical with million others on the shelves. Oh! And don't forget! A good kid would preserve all the junk: large useless wasteful boxes with advertisements for the whole line of plastic somethings.Contact me with Questions, Comments or Suggestions ryitfork @ bitmail.ch",,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The start of something big,"Nowadays people assume that when it comes to what they see up on the big screen computers make absolutely anything possible. If you can dream it you can see it with the assistance of a little computer wizardry. But of course that was not always the case. The computer animation revolution had to start somewhere and that somewhere was Toy Story. The animators at Pixar made the impossible possible. You watch the movie today and it's easy to take it for granted. You forget that Pixar was attempting something entirely new and that there were more than a few doubts as to whether it would work. Oh, it worked alright. It worked spectacularly. Director John Lasseter and his animation team created a visually stunning masterpiece the likes of which had never been seen before. Movie animation would never be the same, Toy Story changed everything.The movie looks great but in order to be deemed a success there had to be a story to match the visuals. All the technological wizardry in the world would not have been able to hide a lousy story. Thankfully that proved to be no concern as we get a compelling and endearing storyline, one which provides plenty of opportunities for some good laughs as well. For as revolutionary as the animation was it is the story and the characters which ultimately make the movie so beloved. To infinity and beyond! Just saying it brings a smile to your face. The toys which are the stars of this story are great, memorable characters. Each is infused with its own unique personality. You can dismiss no toy as ""just a toy"". Each toy has its own story, its own life. All the voice actors deserve great credit for the work they did in making each toy stand out in its own way. Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear are of course the big stars and they both fit their roles perfectly. But whether playing a dog, a pig or a potato head each voice actor was uniformly terrific. R. Lee Ermey as a little green army man and Wallace Shawn as a Tyrannosaurus with serious anxiety issues are two personal favorites. So many characters which are so easy to embrace and each of whom is good for some laughs too. And there's even room for a great villain in Sid, the evil toy-destroying kid next door. A great cast of characters brought brilliantly to life by the great work of the animators and the voice cast.Toy Story triumphs in making you feel for its characters. Who can't empathize with Woody as he fears being pushed aside by Buzz? Who hasn't had insecurities like Rex? Who can't understand Mr. Potato Head's longing for a Mrs. Potato Head? When the toys hurt you hurt, when they triumph you feel as if you shared in it. It's a movie guaranteed to put a smile on your face. If there's any complaint it might be that the movie, at a trim 80 minutes, isn't long enough. We want to spend more time with these toys. Of course we would get the opportunity to do so in sequels to come. But the original movie certainly stands on its own merits. It's a movie you can happily watch again and again. And when you do take the time to really look at the world the animation team created for these toys to inhabit. The level of detail in the backgrounds is just as stunning as the beautifully rendered main characters. No corners were cut in creating a world which looks truly lived in. A whole world magically brought to life. Toy Story was, in its time, unlike anything anyone had ever seen. And all these years later the magic is still there. It's a movie which will be discovered, and loved, by generations to come.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A Classic in Computer Animation,"Toy Story is the first ever computer animated film and was an instant classic. It was one of the movies I grew up watching, so I have some nostalgia bias. It shows the evolution of kids' interest in toys from Western based toys like cowboy toys to space based toys like astronaut action figures.The story involves a kid named Andy and his favorite toy Woody the Cowboy. Andy has a birthday party before he, his mom, and his toys move. Andy gets a Buzz Lightyear action figure and Buzz quickly becomes Andy's new favorite toy. Eventually, they get into the hands of Andy's not so good neighbor with a horrific imagination around the same the move is taking place.I find this is the best film to compare to when you want to see how computer animation has evolved as it was the first film to be fully computer animated. I often like to compare the first Toy Story to the last (of which is the fourth when writing this review) to see how computer animation has evolved as both are part of the same franchise. It has been around 24 years since the release of the two films. When the fifth releases, I would then compare the first with it to see a little more accurate representation.With Toy Story being a classic and a nostalgic film of mine, it'll be an easy recommendation of mine and an easy 10/10 for me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Let me just say it...My favorite Animated movie,"I really like animation, just the idea that you can basically take any idea, and characters, and make them do anything you want. Now a days there are three major animation companies, Disney, Dreamworks, and Pixar, sure there are others, but they never make films as famous as these three. And of those three, without a doubt the best working today is Pixar, they revolutionized animation by creating the first CGI animated movie, and that's what I'm talking about.Toy Story is not the most complicated or mature animated film you'll ever see. It's a simple story of a cowboy doll named Woody, who is neglected by his owner Andy after he gets a Buzz Lightyear Action Figure. Then by some weird circumstance, they both end up in the home of Andy's neighbor Sid, who is basically what would happen if you put Hitler and Osama bin Laden together, made them a teenager, and turned Jews and Americans into Toys.The animation is great, as the first fully CGI animated movie, it's beautiful to look at, but the characters are so engaging that you forget about the animation. And there are so many hilarious moments that any flaws with the film are forgivable. But really the only flaw I can see is that the humans look more like toys than the actual toys.Everyone has their favorite animated movie, some have one of the films in the Disney Animated canon, some say one of Dreamworks movies, maybe even a Don Bluth or Blu Sky movie, or another Pixar flick, but my favorite animated movie is Toy Story, maybe it's just nostalgia, but it's still a wonderful film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story Review,"Woody, a toy cowboy is considered to be Andy's favourite toy, but when Buzz Lightyear joins Andy's collection of toys Woody feels is position is being threatened.I was born in 2003, 8 years after the release of this film. For me Toy Story was not a big part of my childhood, and I can only really remember watching once before now. This was essentially my first viewing of the film and was very glad to see that the film is as good as they say.The imagination of John Lasseter is astonishing. Throughout the entire film I found myself constantly in awe of how John was able to make a movie about toys so intriguing.Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are both equally great as Woody and Buzz and their relationship is what makes this film. The rest of the cast all give very good vocal performances but they were very much used as comedic characters.My favourite scene in the film is when the toy soldiers set out to do recon on Andy's birthday party, I found it extremely hilarious and visually pleasing.My one gripe with the film may just be a misunderstanding. Buzz is shown as not believing that he is in fact a toy, but it isn't explained whether or not the rest of the toys went through that also.Overall Toy Story is an extremely well made film with a great cast and a filmmaker with an incredible imagination.9.5/10

You've got a friend in me,"""Reach for the sky""! The opening statement of Woody (Hanks) a toy cowboy during a boys playtime. A statement that proves to be ironic when he later looks up at a toy from space, Buzz Lightyear (Allen). Woody's owner is growing older and Woody struggles to accept the change as Buzz becomes Andy's new favourite toy. Leading from the once strong leader into a bout of jealousy and even malice as he tries to take Buzz out of the picture. Woody is then separated from Andy via a fight with Buzz and has to find a way home. Further change occurs as Woody is forced to align with Buzz to escape the toy antagonist Sid. It takes 3/4 of the movie for Woody to finally change his ways, and work with Buzz for the final great escape.Woody's journey from leader to outcast to redemption is intriguing to watch unfold. His final monologue with Sid was beautifully written as the toy out wits the boy. The whole irony of his story is that a child's mind is fleeting and 10 minutes of playing with Buzz and Woody would have been in the game again.For me it is Buzz that follows the greater path of change. Noble and confident throughout mostly due to being under the illusion he is an actual space ranger. Kudos to the writer who decided to take a toy from this world and make him believe he is real! Simple but incredibly compelling. Buzz's final realisation that he is a toy is arm breaking for him but heartbreaking for us. For a family movie Buzz's breakdown is surprising and well delivered and the journey back to being he hero has Buzz literally ""Reaching for the sky"". With us the viewers figuratively as we are up there with them cheering the final events.Woody and Buzz's journey home is supported by a cast of toys, each with a filled out personality. Loyal Slinky being one of my favourites, always reluctant to turn on his buddy Woody like the others.It's the direction of John Lasseter that puts us into this world. When Woody shouts ""You are a toy"". It's John speaking to us. From the beginning the camera is at ground level. We are not supposed to be a child watching his toys come to life but an actual toy, low level shots panning up throughout give a feel to the vastness of a toys world. We are right there through each playtime, adventure, triumph and failure and by the end Buzz may be flying but we are falling for these toys, in style.The story and characters are a success but the triumph is the medium in which the story is told. Through 3d animation, never before seen feature length. The Pixar animators made a bedroom and a pizza planet truly realistic. They brought toys to life in movement and texture. But most astonishing of all, they made us care for a bunch of 3d shapes put together through countless hours of rendering in a computer. The result is a metaphor for change, not just in the story itself and it's characters but in the medium it is told. The great change from 2d to 3d animation which is now common place for feature animation.This movie is a game changer for cinema and animation alike.

Old but Gold,"I'm very glad that Disney+ has finally arrived here at Philippines and I've finally got the chance to watch Toy Story. At first, I was hesitant to start the movie series knowing that the first one had been released 26 or 27 years ago. I have thought and assumed that the first Toy Story movie would have a cliche plot and every scenario would not be new to me, but I was wrong. Even the old or classic ones of Disney movie won't still disappoint up to this day with its story, plot, and life lessons. Upon getting to the finale of the movie, it was just fun, relief, and amazement what I feel. I'm very excited and looking forward for the movie 2!

I would watch it many time before I choose to watch any other Disney movies. I think that the animation in this is also amazing. Having Tom Hanks as woody I would say was a good choice and has been great in many other toy story films. I think for the technology they had they made it amazing.

One of Pixar's finest that has you looking back before leaving the room,"Andy's favourite toy Woody the cowboy gets jealous when he is replaced by the new space toy Buzz Lightyear.Anyone of any age who has already seen this film will tell you, no matter what think about CGI, that the sheer concept of this film is excellent. For the person who thought up the idea of toys coming to life, thank you. You have given this world an imaginative theory, which will be with us every time we leave the room.Though everything about this film is exquisite, the ideology of living toys makes it what it is. When we first see Woody get up off the bed we need to blink a couple of times to make sure its real. Of course with modern technology CGI is hard not to use and this film was one of the first that was used effectively and though has now lost its significance. Nothing is lost in terms of the story however and the visuals and the finest direction Pixar ever achieved until Wall-E help create a warm fun family film. Will any other company beat Pixar on the animation stage? Shrek, Kung Fu Panda and Madagascar, though all good, don't have that extra depth and sophistication Pixar creates so easily.Filled with great laughs and a suspense adventure, Toy Story is a sit down and enjoyable movie for the whole family. But then it is so much more than a movie.Every Pixar movie has a message. Wall-E provided an insight into loneliness and the good of man kind, Monsters Inc told the tale of children's fairy tales and Cars reflects doing something for others.This 1995 hit preaches to its audience through its characters. Woody's jealousy at being replaced and his suffering are almost tear worthy. We have all had our favourite toys and replaced them and this simple message will trigger something deep down inside any viewer. Buzz's commitment to who he really is and his strong beliefs are great in shaping his character and preaching to viewers to believe who they really are.Most importantly though is friendship and how important it can be to get someone out of trouble for the good of someone else. This message is further emphasised through the best Pixar song of all time, ""You've got a friend in me"" Always consistent, always funny and always entertaining, Toy Story is a fun family film that will forever be remembered for its strong messages, entertainment and animation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"Toy Story was technologically groundbreaking, but also a heartwarming and original adventure","Honestly, I don't think I can fully appreciate Toy Story's boldness and uniqueness, as Pixar has since made great family computer generated animated movies ubiquitous, and I certainly have been able to take that for granted my whole life. Even so, watching Toy Story for the first time in over a decade, it exceeded my expectations in its characters and script, and the animation looks as good as ever. Woody's internal struggles and seeing a protagonist of a kid's movie be clearly flawed but still likable is so refreshing. I love the animosity between Woody and Buzz, and the way the toys each have their own quirks but are something of a hive mind. Even if the events that occur are a bit over the top, the structure and plot is actually really exciting and coherently presented. I loved the misjudgement of Sid's toys and their role in the success. I've seen movies twice as long fail to deliver on half as realistic and well fleshed out characters or emotional stakes as in Toy Story. Between the groundbreaking animation for the time, the consistent characters and plot, and sheer adolescent joy and adventure, Toy Story deserves its place as a classic.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"8.5/10 - Sharply Written, Fun to Watch","I don't think that I really need to sum the plot here, but just in case you don't know, Toy Story is about the toys of a kid named Andy, specifically a cowboy named Woody, that kinda gets pushed aside when Andy gets a new, shiny toy - Buzz Lightyear, the space ranger. Oh, and obviously the toys are alive, and they hide from humans whenever they're around.Oh, and Toy Story is the first Pixar movie ever, and the first full-length CGI film that got into theatres.I'll admit, I watched it a lot as a child but I haven't seen this film in years, so I thought that I may not be as good as I remebered, and you know? It was actually as good, even better.Every main character is so fun and memorable - not only because of the sharp, funny dialogue, nor the iconic design, but because of the awesome voice acting as well (Woody, Buzz and Rex are awesome examples for that). The writing is really sharp and funny, as said, and this film is full of little puns that just don't get old.I also really like the soundtrack, that has that childish vibe (which goes very well with the theme of this movie) to it but is still really on point and iconic.The plot is overall intriguing as well, even though it won't be super unpredictable or mind blowing.The only issue that I have with Toy Story is the animation - it didn't age quite well at certain points (Sid's dog XD), but I do think that overall the animation is really solid, even though it's not as detailed as what we got used to with time.So, yeah, I enjoyed it all the way through, and I truly feel that this film has a certain charm to it. If you haven't seen it already, please do. I'm feeling an 8.5/10 on this one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

The one film that started what is now a cliché,"I remember it all very well. I was about six years old when this movie came out. I remember the movie being sold out when I saw it and I had to wait to get in to see it. It was well worth the wait, even as a six year old I could realize that. Toy Story was the first fully computer animated movie ever to be made. This was a huge impact in the world of special effects and art. That was part of the reason why this movie was such a huge success. The other reason for the huge success is because of the concept of the movie. Where else can you find a movie where toys come to life and have their own world inside of a little boy's room. This is one of the first movies to have that type of story.The other computer animated movies to follow Toy Story are A Bug's Life, Antz, Toy Story 2, Shrek, Monster's Inc., Ice Age, Shrek 2, The Incredibles, The Polar Express, and Shark Tale. After seeing Shark Tale, I figured out that computer animated films are starting to become a cliché. However, the Pixar movies are really good.The voice work in Toy Story is also really good. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen are the perfect voices to fit the characters of this movie. This was also a part of Tim Allen's big uprising in the '90's.Every kid should see this, most kids that I know like this movie. Anybody else who somehow hasn't seen this should also see it to see where the animated films of today got started from.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Very nice,"In 1995, ""Toy Story"" revolutionized animation by becoming the first feature film entirely created by computer. Set in a kid's bedroom, the film introduces us to a world where toys come alive when their owner isn't looking.Woody, the pull-string cowboy (voiced by Tom Hanks), is the beloved leader of Andy's toy collection. His friends include Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, Hamm the Pig, and Bo Peep. But Woody's comfortable existence is threatened when a flashy new toy arrives: Buzz Lightyear, the space ranger.The film's magic lies in its ability to fully animate characters and their surroundings. We soar through space with Buzz, bounce off beds, spin around hanging toys, and zoom through loop-the-loops on model car race tracks. The attention to detail is mind-boggling, with each frame requiring hours of computing time and massive amounts of data.""Toy Story"" isn't just about technical wizardry, though. It's a heartwarming tale of friendship, loyalty, and self-discovery. As Woody and Buzz navigate their differences, the film captures both kids' imaginations and adults' admiration.So, buckle up for this visionary roller-coaster ride-a timeless classic that reminds us that even toys have dreams.

Great Movie,"Still one of the best computer generated movies, great story, voice work, and the animation still holds up after all these years. A terrific movie for all ages. Tom Hanks delivers a believable character in Woody, and this is clearly some of Tim Allen's best work in his career, if not his BEST, he often just plays boring frustrated dad characters, it gets really old, and he doesn't have any energy, but his voice works as Buzz Lightyear. Altogether the movie is funny, the story's well crafted, enjoyable to watch over and over again. Very much advised to watch this over the much overrated The Incredibles, this one's actually great. Not average but for some reason believed to be great which The Incredibles surely isn't, but that's another review. If you haven't seen it, buy it or rent it.

Woody's world is turned upside down when Buzz arrives on the scene, sparking a rivalry that threatens to unravel the harmony of their toy universe.

Pixar begins,"I recently went to see the double feature which included ""Toy Story"" and ""Toy Story 2"" and I don't know if it's the nostalgia kicking in but it was still quite fun. I mean it wasn't good as when I first saw it when it came out when I was in elementary school, but it was still pretty entertaining and brought back some memories. The animation was amazing, and phenomenal when it first came out and still holds up today. The voice actors even did a great job, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did a great job with there performance in portraying Woody and Buzz Lightyear. It was a exciting adventure, although the plot was simple it was effective and entertaining.The story is about toys coming to life, but keeping themselves secret by acting like they aren't alive. But the toys coexist with humans peacefully, except the toys in Andy's room get worried on birthdays and Christmases of being replaced. Thus when Andy's favorite toy get replaced by a new favorite toy, the conflict starts from there when the older toy that was Andy's favorite tries to hide the new toy, but ends up hitting it out the window. Although this day and age, kid's who are about Andy' age probably won't play with the types of toys portrayed in the movie, and the magic was sort of lost from when I saw it when I was in elementary.

Brings out the child in you.,"I remember watching this movie when I was a child. I was a great fan of animation movies as nearly every child is, so I was very excited about it. And, I have to say that it has exceeded my expectations in every possible way and knocked me out of the ring. The concept of toys talking when humans aren't around caused a certain excitement in me, I was happy that toys were alive, I was a child again without knowing it. The characters are so well designed that one gets intensely attached to them.Especially Buzz Light Year, when I was a child I dreamed of wearing a space suit and traveling in space with a jet pack at my side. And when I saw Buzz, I was totally surprised at how my thoughts of a super hero were projected into reality. And Woody is a great character, the Mr. Popular , the guy next door, call what you may he is that. And the rest of characters are equally good.

A Film That Made My Childhood,"Introduction:
""Toy Story"" was the first film to come out of Pixar. And frankly, it still remains as one of the best. While, in my opinion, the weakest film in the series, that doesn't mean it's at all bad. Toy Story is still an amazing film, and one of the best animated films of all time.The Story:
Telling the story of two enemies that becomes best friends by the end. Not needing to be complicated, the film tells a very simple story, that can be enjoyed by adults and kids.And I just love the idea of what the toys in your room are up to while you're not looking.The Characters:
Woody and Buzz Light-year are two of my favorite characters in all of cinema. As they both go through their respective arcs. Woody learning that he doesn't have to be the center of his owner Andy's attention. And Buzz, who learns that he can accept the place he has in the world.The Animation:
Being the first full length computer animated movie, the style was impressive for time, but is not all that impressive today. However, it did look good back then, and I can forgive the film.Conclusion:
Toy Story may not be my favorite in the Toy Story series, but it's still a great film. And one of my favorite films of all time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

An Instant Classic!,"After a few short films and no major recognition-in 1991, Pixar set out to start the ball rolling for computer-animated entertainment and in 1995 unleashed not just a mere film but a work of art. An instant classic when first released...Toy Story went on to earn nearly $400 million worldwide and capture the hearts of children and adults alike with its unforgettable characters, magical musical score, hilarious script and the classic quote ""To infinity and beyond"".Woody (Tom Hanks) is an old-fashioned pull - string cowboy doll living a life of luxury as the favourite toy of a young boy named Andy. Surrounded by a colourful cast of characters - such as the cynical Mr. Potato Head, the wisecracking Piggy bank Hamm and Woody's brown-nosing second-in-command Slinky Dog - Woody seems something of a king. However, when a new toy arrives on the scene-a high tech spaceman action figure named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Woody suddenly loses his popularity. But this toy comes with a surreal extra feature - he thinks he's the real Buzz Lightyear!! In the effort of removing Buzz as Andy's favourite toy-both toys are swept out of their home, and into the outside world where they unite reluctantly in friendship for an adventure home.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I'm glad I got to witness hisTOrY,"As a kid I didn't really like 3D animations. Everyone in my class used to get schoolbags, lunchboxes, water bottles etc of Pixar cartoons. The three most popular ones were of Woody, Buzz Lightyear and Mr Incredible. In my review of The Incredibles I mentioned how I hated The Incredibles until I watched it myself, since I came from a conservative family which didn't allow me to watch foreign films. I finally watched Toy Story when I was 15 years old, and this was so awesome! Later I got to know that it was the first ever 3D animated movie, and since then my respect for it has increased exponentially.Toy Story is a story about Woody, a toy cowboy who was his master, Andy's favourite toy. Andy was absolutely obsessed with Woody, until Buzz Lightyear came over and completely took over his love. Not just Andy but even the other toys started getting more interested in Buzz. As a result Woody became jealous and decided to settle the score. Things don't go the right way when Woody also ends up getting thrown out along with Buzz, and then they both have to team up to get back to Andy.The thing that really strikes me about Toy Story is that it had a huge risk to carry. Since it was going to be the first ever 3D animated feature film, it was supposed to give an example for the other films to follow. There are many examples of how the first film of a genre makes the genre successful and when it doesn't happen (Superman, Super Mario Bros, Alam Ara etc). In this case Andrew Stanton and Joss Whedon did a great job in making a mark by writing the story that is one of the most iconic of all time.The animation is also pretty good. The first game isn't even close to what gaming is now, the first science fiction movie is nothing in front of science fiction movies now. But the first 3D animated movie is easily something that can give a competition to what they make nowadays. The ADR, the cinematography, the story, the comic timings and even the message that the movie gave - everything about this movie is so good. This is the reason why today Toy Story is one of the most iconic franchises of all time. My favourite character in the movie was RC. He was the only one who didn't misjudge anyone. He helped Woody and Buzz come back home together. Even watching his remote control was fun; it had a steering wheel! As a kid I was never allowed to play with remote controlled cars, so just seeing such an advanced car being driven was enough to get my attention.I'm lucky to have been alive at a time when Toy Story was a phenomenon. It was an absolute perfection of a movie. It's kind of surprising that Joss Whedon, the same guy who made this masterpiece, later went on to make the 2017 Justice League. I hope this movie stays alive in the future and we get to see what all things can be added in the future movies because, let's get real, this franchise isn't gonna die anytime soon.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

An amazing family film,"Toy Story is a timeless classic. Probably the most genuine, innocent, simplistic yet powerful attempt to create a children film which appeals both adults and kids alike.It is the story of how two rival 'living' toys - a old western cowboy toy (Woody) and action figure of a space commander (Buzz Lightyear) become best friends under some dangerous circumstances. There are bunch of numerals toys like Mr. Potato, a Barbie, a magnifying toy, a truck, alien toys and many more.The film is crafted so well that within some few minutes of the film, you are intrigued to it. It is a fascinating film, with amazing characterization. The toys are so believable that you feel close to them. You feel cherished when Allan and his company make a spoiled brat kid Sid (who loves blowing up toys) realize how important is to save toys which bring back the memories of childhood.I must say the script is effortless and very well written. Music by Randy Newman is also great. One striking thing in this film are its sound effects and CGI which are considered ground-breaking for a 1995 film.Overall, the film is highly recommended. Not only for children, but for everyone who love cherishing the childhood memories - the lovely Toys.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
For kids also for adults,"As the beginning of Pixar's animated feature film, Toy Story is still a very interesting and imaginative work even today.

It is a fairy tale that also belongs to adults.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"The Magic Starts Here,","Toy Story is a fantastic movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding voice cast. It is complete harmless fun from start to finish, as we follow a group of toys that come to life when the owners are not around. All the characters are very well established, Woody is very layered with great depth and there is great development put in to Buzz Lightyear over the course of the film.The humour in the film is terrific, a great balance between what children and what adults will find funny. It is clear that Pixar tried very hard to ensure this would be a movie that the entire family, people of all ages, can watch and enjoy.The cast is phenomenal, Tom Hanks shines as Woody and truly embodies the emotions the character is undergoing. Tim Allen is also terrific as Buzz Lightyear and conveys the characters realisation of his reality brilliantly throughout, other highlights for me would be Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head and John Ratzenberger as Hamm.It is a feel good movie and you will find it hard not to wipe the smile off your face from start to finish. Funny, sweet and well animated, Toy Story is fun for the whole family.When Andy gets a new toy for his birthday, his favorite toy, Woody, grows jealous as he feels he's getting replaced.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"Good, but I prefer the second film.","I have seen this several times before, although apparently I never rated it at IMDb. I've only started adding ratings to my lists of watched movies in the past few years, so I don't know if I actually rated it before. If I had, I might have given it a 9 or 10 in previous years, but after watching it again, I'd have to give it an 8. Most of this lowered rating is due to Woody's petulance and jealousy in the first half of the film, although the second half makes up for it.Of course, it IS the first computer-animated film, and ushered in a new era of animation. Still, is that necessarily a good reason for giving it a higher rating? I wouldn't categorize this as my favorite Pixar film by any means, although it's certainly not my least favorite. I'm of mixed emotions regarding the Randy Newman music. I enjoy some of his songs (like You've Got a Friend in Me,) but dislike his singing. Also, whenever I hear him singing, I'm reminded of the Family Guy bit where he basically just sings what he sees.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of the Best Animated Movies,"Toy Story is probably one of the best animated movies that I have seen. The characters are a cast that you can root for, the plot is easy to follow, and the entire film is generated within the realm of computer animation. There are some things that are holding it back, the first one being that animation is dated in comparison to it's sequels and other animated movie titles. Perhaps if they were to do a technical remaster of this movie but who knows. Another thing that holds back this movie is the runtime, which is sort of a nitpicky thing to criticize but for what it is, it's not too short and thankfully not too long. Overall Toy Story is a good watch for movie night with family and friends. Definitely recommend for entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

One of the all time greats - but you know that already.,"The toys of a small boy have their cosy lives thrown into disarray with the arrival of a new space toy, and the family's imminent move to another home...The first real mainsteam adult-friendly computer animated film. Actually the first real computer-animated film. Toy Story took a cutesy premise and made it believable with a very good storyline, excellent voice acting and amazing design, especially for the time even though this holds up exceptionally well now.More important than this is the longevity of the characters, you can have the prettiest backdrop and brightest colours going but if a kid doesn't like the characters in the thing it isn't going far.Go to a birthday party for any kid under 10 and you'll likely see a Buzz Lightyear or Woody the cowboy. More important this film can be watched and rewatched by anyone from 3 to 43 and there will be something to enjoy, again and again.As a side-note: My videoshop password was Woody for about 5 years thanks to this movie.What you hope kids will learn: Be good to your toys. What they'll take away: Space toys are cool. And Cowboy toys are cool. And Dog toys are cool. And I need one of those Dinosaur toys. Oh, oh, oh and a Mr Potato Head... And a Piggy!

Toy Story — An incomparable animation about toys' secret life,"Toy Story, the first of the series, was a spectacular achievement. Not only was it completely rendered digitally, the quality was very high to equal or better most standard animation, but it was actually excellent fun. On top of that, you had the novel idea of a toy's secret life, a great story, awesome voice acting, lots of jokes, a bit of drama, some suspense, real life conflicts of personality, solid dialogs, and some heroics, all of which resulted in a complete package that anyone of any age can appreciate.The cast distribution was done smartly, each actor corresponding perfectly to their characters. The soundtrack was discreet and avoided a big sing along, which is a blessing.The only thing that could be thought of as negative was the technology limitation at the time. The colors are a bit stiff, lacking a bit of shadowing and lighting, but it's really minimal, certainly not enough to distract from this quality piece.I highly recommend it unless you're not interested in animation at all.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
the beginning of Pixar,"Nice message about friendship, I like this kind of interactions of odd couples, Woody and Buzz can shine on their own.

"Superbly animated, brilliantly witty, instantly likeable and endlessly entertaining.","The first ever fully computer generated movie, `Toy Story' really is a milestone in cinematic history. Enjoyed by young and old alike, this is funny even for the most bitter minded. After all, what's not to like? It isn't a three hour epic like `Gone With The Wind' but it is thoroughly entertaining for its eighty minute running time and hastily avoids wearing out its welcome.Not only is the animation brilliant but the characters are even better. Tom Hanks was perfectly chosen as the neurotic, jealous but easily likeable Woody. He proves that he can do comedy, even if he doesn't physically appear in the movie. Always reliable for his comedy, Tim Allen certainly delivers jokes at a rapid rate. And he perfectly fits into the role as Buzz Lightyear. The chemistry between the two main characters is priceless. Sure, they aren't `Bogart and Bacall' but they make a great duo. The supporting cast of characters include Rex, Slinky, Mr. Potato Head and Little Bo Peep. They are brilliantly animated and while most of the limelight goes to Woody and Buzz, they still make good use of the scenes they're in.The film was soon followed by a sequel `Toy Story 2' in '99. While the animation was more impressive and it was a bigger film, I still preferred the first one. Mainly because `Toy Story' had more chemistry between Woody and Buzz. But also because the sequel didn't have as many good laughs and aimed for boring sentimentality a bit too often.So overall, `Toy Story' is an outstanding breakthrough in the world of animation.  The comedy, visuals and level of enjoyment are all picture perfect. There are no flaws and the film barely ever makes a wrong move. 8.5/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Nostalgia,"I watched this film when I was just three years old, since then I've watched it almost twice every year and it doesnt get old. Over the last couple of years I haven't had the time to watch it, but I watched it the other day.This movie being a major part of my childhood, I have to exclude all emotions and review this as a movie itself.Being one of the first animation movies, this movie truly delivers. It has an incredibly interesting plot. I mean a toy sheriff has to deal with the jealousy as a toy space soldier takes his place as Andy's favorite? That already is enough to catch someone's attention. Then the acting is superb. The animation is done beautifully and the story is extremely fluid and is paced beautifully. Character development is more than sufficient in this movie and it is paced properly into three acts. I have to say this movie really is one you should watch at home and that you can enjoy. Just beautiful.I rate this an 8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Perfect! A badge to be worn proudly by Pixar.,"Of course my opinion, but truly,honestly perfect! It is an amazing standalone, kid, and Pixar film with all the great motifs of all. It teaches children good values about who are in the world, and mortality. It also appeals to all ages and has incredible animation for 1995, and also was great enough to be unforgotten all the way until now 2015, 20 years later. Buzz's realization that he is just another product to be sold in the world, is in my opinion, one of the greatest moments of movie and entertainment history. The movie gives you a lot of things to speculate on like is Woody a bad toy? Or can a movie have virtually no villain but the hero or at all? The choice is 100% yours and that is what I love most about the movie. It is absolutely timeless and unforgettable and I highly suggest watching it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Great movie! Wrote this for English 120! Check it out!,"Have you ever wondered if toys come alive when you aren't looking? Well, the movie Toy Story answers just that!This movie has me by my heart strings. Growing up when I was a wee lad of small age and stature. I had grown in love with toys. As all small boys I imagined them being alive. So you can assume when I was a child and saw Toy Story for the first time I was off my rocker and was enamored with this glorious depiction of toys being alive. My childish mind had loved the idea of toys being alive and all the way till today. This movie is a part of me and my childhood. I have a whole box of toy story figures to prove it.The film starts in a small boy's room, named Andy. It is a regular day in 1995 I'm assuming. Cardboard boxes are set up to look like an old western town. Woody, a cowboy doll and one of the main characters, voiced by Tom Hanks, is ""sheriff"" in the town. Andy is playing with his toys and pretending Hamm, a piggy bank is wreaking havoc upon the town. And Woody is there to stop him.Within the first two minutes of the film, you have tasted the whole buffet of what you're getting yourself into. A story driven adventure with toys. The toys are lively, relatable and moody. The two main characters are complete opposite in all aspects. There's Woody, a sheriff cowboy, aged with years of play and kind of an old outdated toy, complete with a pull string that says ""There's a snake in my boot."" Buzz Lightyear, voiced by Tim Allen, is a space ranger of star command. He is updated with all new bells and whistles complete with a ""karate chop action,"" a laser pointer, and he glows in the dark. The antagonist is the next door neighbor kid, Sid. A creatively destructive boy that likes to blow stuff up.When Buzz shows up unannounced, and threatens Woody's ""spot on the bed"" Woody is determined to get rid of him. And what ensues is a wonderful plot that is carried on with lively, entertaining characters. Supporting characters are just as special and well thought out. Mr. Potato Head, is based on the actual toy Mr. Potato head. He, of course is mad at the world and generally grumpy, probably due to the fact he gets his face knocked off many times throughout the film. Slinky, is based on the slinky with a twist of being a dog. His character is rustier and offers the maturity compared to the rest. Rex, a toy tyrannosaurus, is silly, clumsy, and the comedy relief. Hamm, a piggy bank, is the witty, one liner, know it all. Bo Peep, a doll shepherd and the love interest in the movie. Although this plays a very small role in the movie. Sarge is a veteran small plastic army man, who leads a small battalion of little green army men. Lastly there is RC, who is a remote controlled toy vehicle. He doesn't say any words in the movie except his ""revs"" he does to communicate with the others.The lovable characters, and beautiful voice acting come from a diverse cast of celebrities and voice actors. The movie also pays close attention to detail to everything you expect and more! I've seen this movie over the years, well over 15 or 20 times. Each time I watch, I notice something new. For instance, I noticed some of the adult jokes in the movie earlier I had not gotten. In one of the scenes Mr. Potato Head gets frustrated and removes his mouth and touches his butt with them. As an innocent child I had disregarded this gesture as something else but in retrospect I now know that he was implying the saying ""kiss my ass"" which made me laugh out loud the first time I had gotten it. I had been so naive and innocent before. And now watching the movie with my adult ""glasses"" I have gotten a whole new look of the movie. Makes me love it even more. When it offers something to the parents as well, you know you're making an excellent movie.My critiques are few and probably nit-picky. This movie is a well- rounded film and I don't have much to complain about. First off, I wish some of the supporting characters had more screen time to flesh out their personalities even more. I loved the interactions they had and I was sad to see there wasn't much of them throughout the film. Owning the Blu-Ray version of the film made me spot some technical animation errors as well. No film is without errors of course but I thought I'd mention them. The toys' feet seem to shake a tad when they walk and they seem to awkwardly float a little above the ground at times. Also the facial animations can get a bit funky and odd at times. I have no idea how difficult it is to make facial expressions animations on computer software, but I'll give them credit where credit is due. They did a fantastic job and I applaud them.I am no expert on films, but I am just an average joe. A joe that knows a good entertaining movie when he sees one. There is probably more errors or more critiques that I haven't mentioned or noticed but to me the film is as good as it needs to be. To be a kid friendly toy adventure. If you're a kid at heart, I'd still recommend this movie to you. Your inner child will thank you. I know I'll be watching this one for many years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Monumentally Influential,"The influence of this film cannot be overstated. Nearly every single animated film released today owes a lot to the computer generated graphics pioneered by ""Toy Story."" Although it looks pretty dated for today, this movie is a complete overhaul after decades of traditional animation techniques that made feature-length films in the genre something that was restricted to Disney and other studios. This film was an absolute game-changer.But aside from all of that, we get a heartwarming tale of a cowboy doll, Woody (Tom Hanks), who feels jealousy after a new space ranger action figure, Buzz (Tim Allen), begins to take up his playtime with their child, Andy (John Morris).Great voice acting by the leads. Randy Newman also has some great tunes on the soundtrack.

A resounding success,"Pixar knocks it out of the park with its first feature film, about friendship, jealousy and the capriciousness of privileged white kids in a society of disposability. A clever, sharp and imaginative screenplay expertly voiced by a stellar cast (I would give this 5/10 just for casting Don Rickles as Mr. Potato Head) keeps the swiftly moving story engaging throughout, flagging only a bit when self- deluded toy Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) is briefly depressed. The film hops from one great set-piece to the next with head-spinning speed that leaves me marveling at how simple director John Lasseter and the team of animators make it look to bring these toys to life with just a few touches of individuality. Every viewer will probably have their favorite parts. Back when I first saw the movie upon its initial release, mine was the new-age toys who worship the Claw; upon recent viewing, I think it is ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"" rendition of evil neighbor Sid's bedroom.

A revolutionary work that has gone down in history,"The Toy Story cartoon is a unique creation that we owe to the joint work of Pixar and Walt Disney.

In addition, the film was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Original Screenplay category.The cartoon, like the creator companies, set another bar for themselves, both in a creative sense and in technical innovations. The project managed to attract attention, of course, primarily due to the unusual format, because the characters were drawn on a computer, and projects of this scale have never been done before. But with all this, ""Toy Story"" offers a memorable plot, great characters and a really worked-out world. This combination allowed the cartoon not only to collect an impressive box office of 375 million dollars with a budget of 30 million. Dollars, but also to make the story itself legendary. The cartoon is still popular today, has several sequels, and the younger generation continues to watch the story of cowboy Woody, Buzz Lightyear and their friends with unprecedented interest.Today, viewers are already used to dozens of diverse animated computer projects. It is difficult to surprise us with computer graphics, although every year the technical side of cartoons is also improving. In such a situation, I wonder why the cartoon, which is more than 25 years old, is still interesting to review, given its meager implementation to date. Yes. In 1995, it was a real revolution, but in modern realities, the project, for obvious reasons, lags far behind the mass of others. And the answer suggests itself. The interest does not subside thanks primarily to the story that we see in this cartoon.Toys are the main characters of this picture. They come to life in those moments when people don't see them. Toys live their own lives, have social connections, their own social circle, becoming one family. Each of the heroes adores his master Eddie, they are good together, the heroes know that their mission is to be the boy's toys and give him joy. And this scenario works great. Even as an adult when viewing this picture, I think many are ready to admit, we have at least once, but wondered what if it were true. What if our toys, our children's toys, came to life when we are not with them. An amazing idea, terribly interesting and at the same time adding some magic to our usual life. And let it not happen, such a plot of ""Toy Story"" makes the world much more beautiful.The cartoon is designed to teach viewers true friendship. Everyone's favorite is cowboy Woody. He is a kind of leader of his team, a guy who is used to being the first, beloved and, as it seems to him, exceptional. However, everything changes when a new advanced Buzz Lightyear toy appears in the house. The current situation threatens to bring confusion to a small toy society. Subsequent events will clearly show how the leader of Woody will learn not to be just a pet and the first toy, the story will teach the cowboy to be a leader, a good friend and a connoisseur of each member of the team.""Toy Story"" is an undoubted revolution in the world of cartoons. The film even became the 99th in the list of the greatest films in the history of American cinema according to the American Film Institute. This work will give a lot of pleasant impressions thanks to a nice picture, a lot of jokes, a dynamic plot. The picture is a real decoration of the cinema.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"To Infinity And Beyond, this went.","I told a friend I was going to re-watch 'Toy Story' in the theater due to it being a ""classic"" in which he immediately disputed. I disagree. Much like 1977's 'Star Wars' or 'Citizen Kane,' 'Toy Story' was far before it's time and revolutionized it's genre, in this case: animation. In addition, they took it to the next level with creativity, a perfect combination of humor for both kids and adults as well as an excellent homage to toys people around my age grew up with. I was at the tail-end to some of the toys shown or in the middle when I was a child. So, of course, a great deal of smiles were on my face throughout in remembrance. But, as a movie-lover/amateur critic, it has to go beyond that. I won't like a movie without a great and original script/dialogue, deep characters, good pacing and surprises. This movie has them all. I loved the lines, the voices were pitch perfect, the adventure made up from just from imagination was inventive from minute one and all characters intersected beautifully. Just as child Andy's birthday party is to start, every toy (alive when no one else is around) is worried they'll be replaced and current head-toy cowboy Woody attempts to convince them otherwise. Unfortunately, it is he that's replaced by Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear (love the variances to his name, including ""Light-beer"") who seemingly doesn't know he is anything but an astronaut. Not too far deep into the story is a touching realization/awakening for both and great learning for the people watching, kids and adults alike. Excellent movie, perfect start for the apparently unbeatable Pixar studios and suitable for all ages.

My favorite film as a kid and remains a classic today,"As a kid, I remember watching the first two Toy Story films frequently and collecting all the characters from the movie. I found out that it was the very first computer-animated film about two years ago and assumed that's why the movie is still so popular. Woody and Buzz are what made the film what it was then and today and were my favorite characters. I'd have to say that my favorite scene is where Woody and Buzz are launched in the air from the rocket and Buzz frees himself to fly into Andy's toy box. The film remains a classic and always will be to me. I also cannot wait for the third movie to come out June 18, 2010 because I'll be the first in line.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"""To infinity and beyond"" - A Review of ""Toy Story""","Toy Story is a 1995 animated film that follows the story of Woody, a pull-string cowboy doll, and his friends as they navigate the challenges of being toys and dealing with the arrival of a new toy, Buzz Lightyear, to their home. The film explores the themes of friendship, jealousy, and growing up.One of the things that I loved about the film was the animation. The animation was groundbreaking for its time and it holds up well today. The film's story was also well-written, it was engaging, emotional and had a strong narrative that explores the emotions and feelings of the characters. The voice acting was also top-notch, Tom Hanks as Woody and Tim Allen as Buzz Lightyear were stand out performances. The film's humor was also on point and it was able to balance it with the emotional moments.The film also introduced audiences to an entirely new world of talking toys, it was a unique concept and it was executed perfectly. The film's themes of friendship, jealousy and growing up were also relatable and it had a universal appeal.Overall, Toy Story is a film that provides a unique concept, imaginative animation, engaging story, excellent voice acting, and a perfect balance of humor and emotion.

And the amazing part is almost everyone though that Toy Story would be flop and their luck of faith, although disturbing, was way off. Also the characters like Woody, Buzz, Rex and the rest of the gang have rooted in pop culture and its sequels are awesome in their own right.

It was a great movie.,"This was, and still is, a great movie. It was amazing how the toys sort of live a double life, behaving like humans when no one's looking. I loved how all the toys are like a big family, with Woody being like a leader. As for Buzz Lightyear, I thought he was going to be really tall, but it turns out, he's shorter than he appeared. It was hilarious how Buzz believed he was a ""space ranger"". Also, Woody and Buzz sort of reminded me of Tawni and Sonny from the show Sonny With a Chance when they first met. Both Buzz and Sonny were ""the new kid"" who got accepted by almost everyone, and both Woody and Tawni were the only one who didn't accept the ""new kid"" and got jealous (but eventually learned to accept the ""new kid"").

"Pixar Changed the Industry with ""Toy Story""","There were some big technological steps taken in the 90's and we, as movie watchers, got to benefit from them.

Along with the new computer-age animation, ""Toy Story"" employed known actors for the voices. Perhaps that was to give it some legitimacy, but that was rather rare. Animations were largely using voice actors up until 1995 with an occasional star here and there. Toy Story's main hitters were made up of known actors: Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, R. Lee Ermey, Jim Varney, and Wallace Shawn. A generation of families have now benefited from what Pixar and ""Toy Story"" did for animated movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Nice movie,"Toy Story is a 1995 American computer-animated family/buddy film, directed by John Lasseter and featuring the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen. The film was co-produced by Ralph Guggenheim and Bonnie Arnold and was distributed by Buena Vista Distribution. It was written by Joss Whedon, Andrew Stanton, Joel Cohen, and Alec Sokolow, and featured music by Randy Newman. It was the first feature film released to use only computer-generated imagery.I used to watch the movie when I was a child. Actually, I hardly watch it, but I had a chance to watch it recently!!

The Snow White of CGI and better!,"Firstly, Toy Stoy is just a great and heartfelt movie with great and relatable characters and story. When I say it is the Snow White of CGI, it is because what Snow White did for traditional animation, Toy Story did for CGI. If you look closer at it, you can see the faults in the graphics, but to h*** with that! It was the first of its kind!I cannot add much more to this. Toy Story is a fantastic movie and a milestone in the world of animation.

Simply GREAT,"This piece of art definitely indicated what is Pixar capable of. Such a great blend of animation, characters and story. A classic that I keep watching over and over again - mostly synchronized to local languages. Still, guys who did the voice-overs did a great job. A rather simple story, but spiced with so much details. It also covers many views of childhood, kids' imagination, family and yes - it brings messages about friendship, jealousy and trust. Every single toy got character and is equipped with specific character attributes: one big toy is actually sensitive, another is grumpy and cynical, then there is a toy not realizing it's actually a toy and so on. There is not a single boring part. Houmor suits both kids' and adults' sense and there is a plenty of intelligent details about toys features.

Nothing steps to this... Disney/ Pixar's first,"Every child dreams of his toys coming to life and playing back, but the main idea has always been what it will be like if toys did come to life. Well Toy Story answered that question in a more enlighten way that made you eager to see more of the adventures Andy's toys were getting into. Toy Story has a masterpiece storyline that makes you just sit and wonder, the screenplay that blends this toy acts to human interaction is so well done, that if not that the fact that this can't be true, this movie may make kids think this is possible.The movie is about a group of toys who pretend to be lifeless whenever humans are present and come to life to discuss, when humans are not around. The toys behavior, actions and fears are all based on their need to be played with by their owner.This group of toys belong to a boy named Andy, and the Andy's favorite toy is Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), a cowboy dull. Things were rosy when Woody was on top, but then came a new toy who took Woody's place Buzz (Tim Allen). Now Woody who feels threatened tries to get back at Buzz but he drags himself down with his acts, and now he may never see Andy again.Toy Story was the first fully computer animated feature film at its time and it came about when Disney approached Pixar to produce a computer animated feature for them after seeing their short animated film Tin Toy (1988). The production of this movie went through many ups and downs, mostly due to the fact that Disney wanted a story that was nail biting and out of this world perfect, which caused Pixar to work on re-writes that saw the lead characters changing form till they finally settled on Woody the wise leader of the Toys in Andy's room and Buzz the new addition to Andy's toys who is confused as to who he really is.Then there was the talk between Pixar and Disney about songs. Disney's movies at that time were all musicals with the characters breaking into songs, to further pass their message along, but John Lasseter didn't want that at all claiming this is a buddy film, so the two reached a compromise, that the score of the movie will be directed towards the action at hand at the point. That can be seen in the movie at one point when Buzz wanted to fly out the window to prove that he could fly and that he was not a ""Toy"". The song that was playing during that scene of Buzz trying to fly had such lyrics as: ...no, it can't be true, I can fly if I wanted to.Toy Story received massive recognition during its time Review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes has the movie at a 100% approval rating from critics and it also won Three Academy Awards (for Best Original Song, Best Original Score and Best Screenplay).The movie was a financial success, and it gave birth to two other sequels which were bigger financial success Toy Story 2 (released in 1999 and gaining 100% approval at Rotten Tomatoes) and Toy story 3 (released in 2010 and gaining 99% approval at Rotten Tomatoes and it is the highest grossing animation till date making over 1 billion dollars). There was also a direct-to-video animated film titled Buzz Lightyear of Star Command: The Adventure Begins (about Buzz) and also an animated television series Buzz Lightyear of Star Command.Toy Story is a classic true and true one DVD you should own.www.lagsreviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
To Infinity And Beyond,"Toy Story gives CGI animation a really good start. This movie took its execution on the concept of living toys to a whole new level thanks to a very engaging story. The characters are also highly memorable. And the humor is very clever with some jokes the movie can get away with. The animation can look outdated, but there's no denying it looks really good to this day. This is the kind of CGI animation we had back in the earlier days. Funny enough, I have seen some deleted scenes that I'm honestly glad it didn't make it to the movie. Otherwise, they would keep this from being Pixar's amazing debut.

Still the best,"It was a classic on the day it was released, and it's still a classic 10 years later. The story is great, the characters are great, the voice talent is great, and the animation is great. Only the detail suffers by comparison with current computer animated films, but that is perhaps only to be expected.I was surprised and delighted to note Joss Whedon at the top of the list of those responsible for the screenplay - his name means a lot more to me now than it did 10 years ago.This 3D retooling is interesting. For one thing, it demonstrates that it is a relatively easy exercise for CGI animated features. Having said that, it doesn't add an awful lot to Toy Story. Given that the film wasn't envisaged as a 3D feature, there aren't any sequences specifically designed to showcase 3D. The climactic chase and rocket scene works well, and there are scattered moments which make you go, ""Oh, look!"" But nothing which makes you go ""Wow!"" In the way the trailer (created specially for this 3D version) did.But watching Toy Story, 2D or 3D, is never a waste of time - it's that good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Toy Story was like the Snow White of 1995,"I remember going and seeing Toy Story when I was 5 years old at the movies. I fell completely in love with it! It had great animation, great characters and a great story! My favorite character was the Slinky Dog played by my favorite comedian the late Jim Varney (God rest his soul). I loved it towards the end when Slinky is trying to get Woody and Buzz into the moving van and the others toys in the moving van pull on him so hard that he begins to stretch out! That was hilarious! I also liked it when Slinky says Come on PotatoHead! If Woody says it's all right well darn it it's good enough for me! Woody has never stared us wrong before! With Toy Story PIXAR showed us what Computer Animation could do to tell a great story! Toy Story like Snow White it an animated classic that'll go on forever!

This film is the first animated film made entirely using computer technology in film history,"This film is the first animated film made entirely using computer technology in film history, and it is also Pixar's feature film debut. The film has a tight rhythm, witty and no lack of tender moments, and the times have changed, still not outdated. Each toy has a distinctive three-dimensional ""character"" character, which is unforgettable, and the racing chase climax is exciting and exciting.

This Movie is Great!!,"Toy Story was the best Pixar movie i ever watched! It has a good start where Andy has a birthday with his favourite toy: Woody. And Andy's Mom says ""Go Get Molly, the party is about to start!"" So Andy runs to his Room to get Molly. Woody realized he was not Andy's favourite toy anymore, So Woody wants to be Andy's favourite toy again! Woody had to find a way to knock Buzz out of the house, And Andy bringing Woody to Pizza Planet! So Woody was fighting Buzz, He realized he was a lost toy. So Woody Found A Pizza Car with a Spaceship on the top! So Buzz finds a Spaceship Claw Machine. Buzz found Alien toys in the Machine! The Aliens found The Claw! So Sid tries to get Buzz, But he got double prizes!! The Ending was great!! The ending had Andy moving in a new house, Then getting new stuff for Christmas, Then Woody And Buzz seemed happy at each other!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of the best films ever,This has got to be the movie I have watched the most. I remember watching it on loop some days. That being said does it stand up to this day oh yeah it does. First off every part of this film is ironic from pizza planet to the rocket to the claw. But the best part has to be the friendship between woody and buzz voiced perfectly by Tim Allen and Tom hanks. Also I don't remember it being this funny. I crack up every time I hear YOU ARE A TOY. Plus seeing woody's arc from being a bit of a jerk to a selfless toy who helps his friend is believable and satisfying to watch. All in on a film that I will watch and love any day and has got to be one of my favorites.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The toy story is the best I've ever watch,"It's a decent Pixar movie its the 3rd best at of all of them now lets toy story 1995.I love how pixar start's off with there first film and did i love?a liitle bit its a little overrated but ok.I love buzz Lightyear he is fun the whole movie is funny its the most funny out of all the movies but i love. I love slinky,rex,porky,and the bo peep scene were wired not for kids but ok. I love the ending its the best part of the whole movie. The animation it looks pretty good i guess but does was made 1995 so of couse. So woody i did not enjoy sorry he was annoying and he jealous because of buzz but he is it for the WHOLE MOVIE basically until the freaking ENDING like come on and he is loud and mean i don't like it. Sid is horrible and were in his place for the whole movie i don't like that.the middle is a little bad but kinda still good
Story: 5/5. I'm watching these films again with my niece and nephew and I am impressed at the fact that, so many years later, this story still manages to be engaging and effective. It establishes its characters and its rules early on and in a very unstandable way. Andy has many toys, Woody being his favourite, and every birthday and Christmas, the introduction of a new toy introduces possible competition. A clear and simple premise and it is pulled off expertly with clear motivations and good character development that was always sensible. The humour is good and sharp and does not feel dated. The threats were real and tense, too, which is a great achievement for a film with such a setting. The children loved it and followed along easily. The voice acting was good all-round.Visuals: 5/5. This was 1995. That's insane. This is the film that would go on to inspire so many other 3D animated films. With all of the difficulties they would have faced, they did not shy away from interesting angles and camera movements. It was always fun and interesting to look at, with loads of bright colours and action. It really is just impressive what they managed to do here and even the awful human faces did not pull me out of it because the limitations were just there at the time.Sound: 4/5. Having Randy Newman on this soundtrack was absolutely bonkers and it worked. The title track is a classic and always will be a classic. The score was good in general, even though it was not so packed with character that I would call it specifically memorable on its own. The sound design was great.14/15: This is a part of cinema history and it holds up for more than just being innovative for its time - it is just a good story.20 people found this helpful.One of the most incredible, amazing, fantastic and wonderful Disney classics I've ever grown up with. The characters, the mystery, the effects, the story, the musical score, the unforgettable songs, the laughs, everything this classic film offers to anyone and everyone still never gets old. Clearly in this film my favorite character is Woody mostly because one of my favorite things about him is that he really thinks like only a true friend would because only a true friend will never give up on you and will always be there for you no matter what happens and Woody is one of the best examples of that kind of friend I've ever known, Tom Hanks was a perfect actor for playing Woody and for Buzz Lightyear they couldn't have chosen.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Review,"Disney and Pixar team up to create Disney's first full-length computer animated cinematic masterpiece, Toy story. Made in 1995, Toy Story was a marking point in movie history not only for its computer animation, but also having a timeless story full of witty characters and adventures.Toy Story is set in a suburban like neighborhood following an ensemble group of toys. Toys have human like abilities and personalities, but are forced to hide them from their human companions for the sake of being a toy. The main group of toys include a cowboy action figure, a piggy bank, a plastic dinosaur, a Mr. Potato Head as well as many more, all of whom live under their owner, Andy. The movie opens with Andy's birthday, which means receiving new toys to accompany old ones. Woody, voiced by Tom Hanks, is Andy's favorite action figure and also the group's leader. Woody and his fellow toy friends are somewhat threatened but also enthralled by this event. After a short time of announcing what Andy received, the toys are relieved to find that Andy did not receive any new toys. They were in for a surprise. Little did they know that there was a surprise toy on Andy's bed. It was the newest and coolest toy on the market, Buzz Light-year, a space orientated action figure voiced by Tim Allen who turns out to be Andy's next favorite toy. The strange thing about Buzz is that he believes that he is an actual space alien fighter. The toys try to convince Buzz that he is a mere toy only to be favored by Andy. Since Buzz believes he is actually a space fighter this leads into leaving the house and begin his journey to outer space. This ultimately pursues Woody to go and save his rival while getting tied up in a wacky adventure.There is a reason why this film acquired nineteen awards and ten nominations. Both adults and children will be entertained with the concept of living toys. The plot of the movie is really where it shines. There isn't one point in Toy Story where the plot gets boring or dragged out. People at Disney's Pixar developed the characters so well that it makes you understand how characters behave. Also, with a movie with so many diverse characters the audience is bound to find someone relate to. The only downside about seeing this movie is its length. It is around eighty minutes but it seems like the movie is about two hours, but that doesn't mean it isn't a full price movie because it is absolutely worth your time. Toy Story is definitely recommended to all families and especially kids. As for everyone else as an audience, I would recommend the movie if you would like to revisit your child hood or if you just want to see a beautifully animated movie. Whoever the audience may be, Toy Story will put a smile on your face.Toy Story is a classic beyond all means. It has stunning visuals, a crazy plot, deep character development, and most importantly it brings people back to a time when nothing mattered except toys. The most inspiring aspect of the movie is the moral of friendship. It really teaches people that they can't get anywhere in life without companionship. Toy Story also really captured the thought of ""what if toys were alive"" and executed it in a witty way. This movie will definitely be playing on family TV screens till ""Infinity and Beyond""!",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
A true delight,"A stunning feature film entrance from Pixar! 'Toy Story' is a true delight, from the first second to the last.The CGI animation is excellent. All the toys look brilliant, as does the world itself - I love the feel of it. The music is very good, Randy Newman does a nice job - ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" is a cracker.Tom Hanks leads a strong cast. Hanks plays Woody, to fantastic effect. He is the best part of this film. Tim Allen is great, too, as Buzz Lightyear. Don Rickles (Mr. Potato Head), Wallace Shawn (Rex) and John Ratzenberger (Hamm) also bring fun.Everything else is just as terrific: the humour, the pacing, the plot - I enjoy it all. There are probably some flaws in parts, namely Buzz's supposed unawareness, but nothing impacts the viewing experience. Go watch!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

"On it's 20th Birthday, Toy Story still soars To Infinity and Beyond!","In 1989, Disney's The Little Mermaid became a success and launched what is known to be a Disney Renaissance. While The Rescuers Down Under underperformed, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King later became big hits. Unfortunately, Pocahontas, while turning a decent profit, didn't do that well with critics. Because of that, Disney needed some help.They managed to co-produce with a CGI animation company known as Pixar to release their very first computer animated feature known as ""Toy Story"", a story about a cowboy doll named Woody who becomes jealous when a new space toy named Buzz Lightyear becomes top toy to his owner named Andy. One day, when Woody knocks Buzz out the window, he becomes despised and after reuniting with Buzz, they get separated from their owner and end up in a house owned by Sid, a boy next door who destroys toys for fun. Because of that, they need to come up with a plan to make it out alive. But first they need to overcome their differences in order to do so. I remembered seeing this film as a child on VHS and loved it. Twenty years later, it's still a beloved classic and there are a lot of things to talk about.First off, the story is very well-written. It displays some themes of jealousy, friendship, being a toy that makes you special to your owner, and what it means to go Infinity and Beyond. Also, it has some of the best comedy I've ever seen as it has lots of laugh out loud moments including a scene where Buzz starts acting a bit crazy after pretending to drink some tea with some dolls in the ""I'm Mrs Nesbitt"" sequence and the ""You Are A Toy"" where Woody shouts at him that he is a child's play thing and Buzz replies ""You are a sad strange little man and you have my pity. *makes a Vulcan gesture* Farewell. However, the most important thing about the story is it's heart and it's moments are handled really well. Like the scene where Buzz realizes that he's nothing but a toy which leads to the song ""I Will Go Sailing No More"" from Randy Newman which would leave everyone in tears, but the most important scene in the movie is the iconic ""To Infinity and Beyond"" sequence where Buzz and Woody are flying in the sky after freeing themselves from a rocket. That scene itself is and always will be the most epic part in animation history.There's a lot more good things to discuss as well like the animation. I'll admit it doesn't hold up that well after twenty years due to some of the human character animation that look like toys than actual human beings. But to it's credit, this was Pixar's first computer animated movie and some of the animation in Toy Story works to it's advantage. Like the textures of all of the toys and some incredible details like that spoon (seriously, it looks really neat). The pacing is very brisk. At it's 81 minute length, it's never too fast, but it's never too slow either and it takes it's time to let the dialog flow and it does it perfectly. The music score from Randy Newman is really beautiful and well-composed with it's light-hearted tone while balancing it with it's serious moments and the songs are really good. Whether you love Randy Newman or hate him, you can tell that he's actually a good singer and his songs ""You've Got A Friend In Me"" and ""I Will Go Sailing No More"" hit the right notes by being memorable songs.Then, there's the voice acting and it's really spot on. Tom Hanks does a fantastic job as Woody, a cowboy doll with his wit, sympathy, and realizes that others are important to Andy as he is. Tim Allen is great as Buzz Lightyear, a space toy with wit and confusion as he figures out whether he's important to Andy or not. Their chemistry together is the heart of the movie since it's a tale about putting aside each other's differences and working together which strengthens it to it's advantage. The side characters, including Bo Peep, Mr. Potato Head, Hamm, Slinky, and Rex, voiced by Annie Potts, Don Rickles, John Ratzenberger, Jim Varney and Wallace Shawn are never annoying and are very funny. The human characters are also good too and Sid, while nothing special as a Pixar villain, is still very menacing he reminds you of a bully at high school.Toy Story started the trend of computer animated films and other production companies such as DreamWorks Animation, Blue Sky Studios, and Illumination Entertainment to do the same. While some of them rely on style over substance, there are some that had the same heart and creativity and competed against Pixar for nearly two decades and it's still going as of today. Toy Story and later films such as Monsters INC, Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL-E, and Up is what made Pixar so compelling because of their heart that helped them earn their critical acclaim. What I'm trying to say here is that computer animation is what made the industry so successful it convinced Pixar to do the same in the late 2000s' which they also succeeded. Not because of the writing, not because of the characters, and not because of their heart, but because of one thing: imagination. It convinced DreamWorks Animation to do the same and they lived up to them just that on movies such as Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How To Train Your Dragon.So, overall, Toy Story is not only one of the best Pixar animated films ever made, but one of the best CGI animated films that will always go To Infinity and Beyond forever. My thumbs up to Pixar and Happy 20th Birthday.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Great,"Woody and Buzz are set to their adventurer, yet adventurer is a bit predictable... don't get me wrong, the movie did capture right the meaning of a toy and an interesting conflict, yet it does happen when the story become predictable by how it set. The start is predictable by how Buzz thinks his a real space ranger and how Woddy wants to get rid of him. Other than that, the story is write in a smart way to give the film a more artistic touch. The story is engaging, the action is intense, and it did capture right the emotions from the audiences. Its just an example of how you can give a lot from a concept that is just a toy.I know that the animation is from the 95s, but it does look daded. It also has a lack of creativity. Each way, it does have its own world to set itself on and the character animation is smooth enough for its time. The animation here for its time is pretty much GROUND BREAKING, but for today, it does look really ugly.The characters can be a bit of a mix, Woddy starts a bit weak by acting selfish towards Buzz and trying to get rid of him. But he does come at the end as well devolved. While not being fantastic characters, they manage to be good enough for an animated feature. But than there are the others, the other toys comes off as more one dimensional troops more than anything. Non of them is annoying, and they does have some personality, its just their problem is that we don't know them a lot. But each way, the characters we DO focus on are likeable, well developed and original!I highly recommend to check toys story out. It does have some minor flaws that keeps it away from being a top in animation, but it is a great and enjoyable Pixar film non the less.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Awesome,"A very sweet and fun movie. TOY STORY has great computer animation. A simple yet well told story is also added as well.

Andy's toys all have a conscience and are led by his favorite, Woody. But alas, the big new toy from the party unknowingly takes Woody's mantle.Envy and jealousy are brought up well. So is the ignorance of Andy's toys and the loss of innocence from Buzz Lightyear. TOY STORY is well packaged exceeded only by its sequel. A good rent.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

Very first full-length 3D CGI animated film ever made,"Made by the well-known studio known as Pixar and released by the heart of Disney. A story about play toys that physically interact with each other while their owner is out of sight. Woody (Hanks) and Buzz (Allen) are the most memorable characters to date when it comes to 3D graphic animated films (or even animated films in general for that matter). All the sequels and shorts of the series that exist so far all have very memorable and heartwarming moments practically during every big moment of the film. The adventures these toys have will never get any more interesting and exciting. Every other main character besides the first two mentioned are all well thought out and are just as memorable as the other two.

Even the head with spider legs which help them in the movie I think appears there.And guess what? Buzz can not fly, but he do fall with style with his 'wings' opened. Good times from childhood.I liked the story and the details of scenes are very well depicted . Animation gets the attention of children but are made to relate to many adults issues.In few days I'm going to watch Mario Bros which is in theaters.

Andy is a young boy that has to give up his childhood toys. But the toys won't accept that they figure out a way to get back to Andy and stay with him.,This was my favorite movie growing up. It shows what a kids toys would do if they had to be given up and could really talk. Andy is a sweet kid and he wants to keep his favorite toy but can't and I don't remember why. But all in all it is an amazing movie with a great story line. Andy would not give up his toys without a reason. They are in ways his best friends. He loves the toys as much as they love him but some how or another they get separated and the toys won't accept that. They do everything they can to get back to their best friend and don't give up till they get back to Andy. And is so happy when he gets his toys back and he tries his hardest not to lose them again.

Almost perfect,"Toy Story is one of the best animated films I have seen. This film was a real game-changer in the animation industry and I can see why.

Pixar's first feature is a blastoff and classic,"24 years after its release, the first Pixar feature film remains a hallmark in its library and cinema as a whole. Full of humor and humanity, Toy Story is a finely crafted blockbuster with impeccable script delving into our natural yearning for affection and acceptance of one's self.Toy Story is centered between the struggle of Woody and Buzz for Andy's affection, their owner. Buzz is the newcomer and he replaces Woody as Andy's favorite toy. Driven by insecurity, Woody causes Buzz out of their house and this starts the film's main plot of both getting lost and trying to find their way back home. Buzz during this period continues to believe that he is indeed a true space ranger. Woody's true character is gradually unraveled for his utmost devotion to Andy and simultaneously convincing Buzz that he is a mere toy. By a set of circumstances both land on their neighbors house and under the possession of Sid, the toy destroyer kid. Inside Sid's house happens the reveal that shocks Buzz to the core, finding his true meaning: to make kids happy. Toy Story plays off both themes and subplot satisfyingly without sacrificing drama over humor. In fact, both drama and humor come hand in hand.Toy Story looks dated now with 2 decades of technological improvement, but during its time was revolutionary. It should be judged as such. The film is a visual splendor with bright colors aided with a rousing score and an original song by Randy Newman.For anyone interested in animated films, Toy Story should come first on the recommendation list.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
An explosion of supernova star.,"There is a phrase from east european poetry that could be translated as ""Face to face is seen nothing. A big requires a distance"". And also I can remember Sergey Prokofiev who in relation to Sergey Diagilev in 1930s said: ""A scale of this person grows with the distance from him"".That's what I can say about ""A Toy Story"". Of course ""Toy Story"" became a hit immediately. But a door to a new artistic path that this movie opened - is maybe the rarest thing that can happen in the culture. It was an explosion of supernova star that had been brightening for decades! I'm so jealous to people that were involved in creation of it... But in November 22 in 1995 I was celebrating only my third BD.This movie is a very rare example of good drama, genuine humor, originality and multidimensionality of layers of thoughts. It is permeated of irony, humor and candor. Every twist and turn seems not only ""edgy"", but also natural and smart. Woody and Buzz are showing how complicated relationships in complicated circumstances become a strong friendship in the form that is comprehended to any person on the Earth.

Thinking Outside of the Toy Box,"Imagine a different world when humans left the room. Toys come to life from the toy box, and the leader of the group is Andy's favorite toy, a cowboy doll with a pull string named Woody, voice of Tom Hanks. His owner Andy, voice of John Morris, has a birthday party and finds a new favorite toy named Buzz Lightyear, voice of Tim Allen. The other toys quickly become impressed by this new toy and claim him as their new leader, leaving Woody jealous of Buzz. In an attempt to get rid of Buzz for good, Woody soon finds that his plan backfires. Instead, Woody and Buzz end up in the real world with a long adventure ahead of them as they try to get back home before Andy's family moves away.Woody and Buzz don't get along, but they must figure out a way to work together to get home safely. They realize the only way to get home is if they help each other instead of ignore or hurt each other. When Woody begins to help Buzz, they slowly find out they are becoming friends. Now they would willingly help each other in order to get back home to Andy. This shows the importance of friendship and the positive effects of having a good friend. No matter what, they will be there to save you if you need saving.""Toy Story"" was the first film to be completely created by computers. This set the stage for all children's movies coming out now that are entirely computer animated. The toys and people they create actually look real compared to all animated movies being released at the time. It's amazing to see such deep expression on the characters' faces. The film was very upbeat and sent an easy message for children to grasp. Even the humor made children and adults alike want to see this film. This was one of my favorite movies as a child and still is today.As a child, I always wondered if toys came to life, and when I saw this movie I believed it was true. I wished that I had a Woody or a Buzz Lightyear doll. I even wished that my Mr. Potato Head would talk back to me, even though that might be a little scary- it would be cool. I liked the personality that each toy had. I didn't really understand the concept of the movie was revolving around friendship, but I loved the new way they were starting to make movies.

A delight!,"Kids have always wondered if their toys ever came to life when they were asleep and if the toys themselves had lives of their own by doing the same things that humans do.Toy Story is the first film from Pixar Studios to make cartoons more humanistic with CGI than by drawing them out. Tom Hanks provides the voice of Woody the Cowboy, who is the ringleader of the toys around Andy's room. He overhears the important events around Andy's life and one of the things shocking is that they are moving to another home.Most of Andy's toys are compiled of average boy toys: from a nervous dinosaur name Rex (Wallace Shawn) to a grumpy Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickels), a smart Aleck piggy bank called Hamm (John Ratzenburg); even Andy's little sister has toys that join with the gang, Bo Peep (Annie Potts of ""Ghostbusters"" fame) has a crush on the cowboy. There are other characters in the story; a dog on a string name Slinky Dog (Jim Varney of ""Ernest"" fame) and a plastic army doll name Sarge (R. Lee Ermey of Full Metal Jacket).One of the elements of ""Toy Story"" is very psychological, and that is the fear of a new toy. Sure everybody likes to get a new toy, but the problem is that when people buy new toys, they automatically forget that their old toys exist and lose excitement within them. When Andy's birthday party comes a week before the leave, Woody sends Sarge and the plastic army men with the baby talkers to hear what kind of presents Andy has gotten this year. As Mr. Potato jokes that he wants a wife, the gang gets cut off by a nervous Rex and realize that the toys have to stay still.The new toy in Andy's life is the popular and all out, Buzz Lightyear (voiced by Tim Allen) in which he pushes Woody to the side leaving the new toy on the bed. Everybody clamors over Woody being pushed off the bed as every other toy in the room tries to figure out what's up there.Woody is introduced to the new character as he tells everyone he can fly and fire a high laser. A smart-ass Potato Head makes a statement about Woody's voice box that it sounds a car ran over it. Days before the move, Woody is left out of the group as everybody including Bo Peep are all with Buzz Lightyear.Woody has a plan of getting rid of Buzz and he uses an electric race-car to push him out the window. Now every toy is against Woody and want to beat him up; but Andy saves Woody when him and the rest of his family are going out for pizza and can't find Buzz, so Andy takes the cowboy instead. With little relief, when the car stops at a gas station, Buzz has been hiding under the car and fights with Woody outside; suddenly the car leaves with both toys stranded.Buzz has a plan for both him and Woody to get back with Andy; they get into a pizza truck and try to find Andy and his family and notices that the neighborhood bully Sid is there so the toys hide in a toy machine where they are taken with another toy back to Sid's house where one toy is torture to death (relax, its not the main toys). So now they have to work together in order to be with Andy and tell the other toys that everything is all right.""Toy Story"" is a blessing with delight and wonder and just like my review of ""Monsters, Inc."" it's a movie of curiosity and a joy to behold.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"

I used to watch Toy Story almost every day growing up, can't tell you how many times I probably ruined that VHS.The characters are still my favorite in the Disney catalogue. Some people will say that the animation isn't as groundbreaking but this was the film that laid the foundation for CGI as we know it.Still had a blast rewatching it on the big screen with my family. What else can be said: TO INFINITY & BEYOND!Side note: the theater didn't have it's Disney intro like they did with Pirates of the Caribbean.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The definition of a classic,"Rating: 8.0Just about anyone of any age can enjoy this movie. It's iconic and a classic, back when Pixar was more creative with their plots. Nothing much to say, it's a solid children's film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"The original, and still the best.","Woody and Buzz team up to escape evil Sid's house to get back to their nice owner Andy in this unparalleled animated masterpiece, where the script is just as good as the incredibly cutting-edge animation. There is not a single bad thing you can say about this wonderful movie, so just be grateful it exists and watch it over and over again. Not that you need me to tell you that, of course. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
I love this movie,I love this movie. When I was little I kept watching this movie together with my cousin. To this day I continue to see her along with my nephews who love her. I'm looking forward to the new movie. The movie that I like the second when they go to the toy store. In this film what I liked the most has been the part of the move.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
👍,It's a classic and it's really good! If you've never seen this. You don't exist because about everyone has watched this lol.,8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The one that started it all,"In my love for movies, I have come across various types of movies that feel very special to me, but there is one production company in particular that resonates closely to my heart. Pixar is that company and the animation powerhouse of the industry. In 1995, they ventured into their first movie feature with Toy Story, the first movie to be 100% made by computer effects. This of course gives the movie an iconic status in cinema history.The story is about toys that come to life when we aren't watching and in this case, we see Woody (Tom Hanks), a cowboy doll cope with the arrival of a newer toy named Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen). For such an innovative film, the plot might seem quite basic. Still, this works pretty well for the movie, as a good buddy story ended up being a fitting way to introduce us to this world. Future installments would tackle more intricate themes of toys having ""souls"" and their ultimate relationship with humans and specially children. However, the first adventure is still fondly remembered as a feel good movie for all ages that entertains to a great extent. In retrospect, we now know that this little movie was the start of a great series of films (with some duds along the way as well). And what a great start it was.Rating: 9,5/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
"""Go to an Infinity and Beyond""","First animated movie that revolutionized the animation industry. Voice acting was so enjoyable alongside the stroy. By keep watching this movie, you'll never feel old.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
One of my all time favorites!,"Worth watching and rewatching. I love every single one of the Toy Story movies (there are 4 in total for those who don't know, and this is the first and original one).Every single one of these movies are so heartwarming, family-friendly, witty, and hilarious. I also really appreciate that this series celebrate the beauty of friendship. All around entertaining, it's the perfect stay-home-and-snuggle-with-your-favorite-snacks go-to kind of movie. I can probably binge all 4 of these movies. The music is also fantastic and the songs are so well-written.They NEED to make a Toy Story 5. I can't get enough of this series. Must watch. Enough said.",9.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
All time greatest kids story - also for adults,"This has to be the greatest kids all-time story, especially  for young Boys. Which small boy has never imagined that his toys are real and come alive? Technically this is the film that revolutionized animation. It also brought animation from the ""cutie-cutie"", good always beats evil of Disney, introducing a more up-to-date cynicism, slightly dark & gray material, such as the kid Sid and even our hero Woody - though the latter is the main subject matter in that he is attempting to redeem himself. The characters are rich, three dimensional(Most are - except for most humans which is quite ironic and charming) Future generations will love these characters and they will endure forever. Toy Story 2 unashamedly attempts to bring the girls into the action with the lively girl-cowboy character Jessie, and while it is also very successful it just never reaches the freshness found in the original TOY STORY.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Truly deserving of its legacy.,"Please note that I am writing this review having watched the re-release of Toy Story in 3D.If you're reading this you're probably interested in reading what people have to say about the film rather than looking for advice on whether or not to watch it; Toy Story is a highly popular film/franchise and I'm sure that describing the plot would be a pointless exercise. What I do want to describe, however, is the amazing artistic quality of this film that is now roughly fifteen years old at the time of me writing this review. The first feature length animated film, upon its release Toy Story didn't settle for this title; rather, it made its own legacy and is still now perhaps one of the greatest animated films ever made.In Toy Story, it seems that Pixar don't miss a trick; there are gags on gags in all manners, from visual jokes and easter eggs to the wit of the dialogue. These characters, these toys, really do feel human. The themes the film deals with, the most prominent being jealousy, are conveyed through the toys in Andy's room as if Toy Story were a live action drama. We all can relate to the core concept of the film; which of us didn't imagine our toys coming to life like this when we were younger?Watching Toy Story in 3D shows that despite this new technology where we can watch the latest releases in eye-popping 3D, a film will always be as enjoyable in the standard two dimensions if it as well made as Toy Story. Yes, the 3D was highly enjoyable, especially given that the film was not produced with 3D effects in mind; but I could sit at home watching Toy Story on any screen, in any number of dimensions, and feel just as immersed.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Must Watch,I can not describe in words how much I love this film.,10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
very good songs,"this has some of my favourite songs ever to be used for an animated film: Strange Things and You've Got a Friend in Need. the songs makes this now dated(!) film more original than Toy Story 2. The animation is fantastic and cutting-edge at the time. Also, it's only 6 years old now, the animation is still as impressive as it was back all those year ago. What else can I say. But this is 1990s equivalent to Snow White and the 7 dwarfs and,indeed, a lot better!",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
The best movie of my childhood,"The best movie of my childhood. Captured the imagination of myself and billions of others, this movie influenced my childhood and was a terrific movie. Nothing has changed, this movie remains strong and still holds up today. Its a beautiful story which is totally ingenious. I will be showing this movie to my children and I hope it remains a part of childhood for many for generations to come.",10.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
Spectacular,"The first computer-animated picture, ""Toy Story,"" achieves a liberating and new three-dimensional reality and freedom of movement. The film doesn't only animate actors against painted backdrops; it fully animates them and allows the viewer to freely navigate around them.It took 800,000 hours of computer time to create Toy Story. Each frame requires up to 300 megabytes of data.John Lasseter and his team bring Woody, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Bo Peep to life. When their owner is not present, the toys come to life. Woody sends all of the troops downstairs in a Bucket of Soldiers to keep an eye on what's going on. ""Toy Story"" lacks the plot ingenuity and wit of ""Rabbit"" or other Disney animated features like ""Beauty and the Beast."" Its greatest pleasures are just for the eyes, but what delights they are!",8.0,Anonymous,"Adventure, Animation, Comedy"
