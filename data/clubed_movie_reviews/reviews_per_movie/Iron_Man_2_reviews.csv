Iron Man 2 is Totally Worth it.,"For some reason this movie had not been getting the greatest critic reviews. I do not understand that at all. I thought the movie was very enjoyable and a successful sequel in the series.For anyone who has seen the first Iron Man you can expect much of the same in this movie. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony Stark like he is meant for the part. He has the same sarcastic wit and self-confidence that is evident in his other movie roles. Gwyeneth Paltrow, as Pepper Potts, has a comes more to the forefront in the sequel. I also personally love that Jon Favreau is the driver for Stark/Potts, and that he gets into the action a little bit. You have to respect the director for that, even though Jon has done plenty of acting himself.Normally in when they replace someone in a sequel with a different actor/actress I am very upset. However, Don Cheadle replacing Terrence Howard in Iron Man 2 as War Machine/Lt. Rhodes made me happy. This is similar to what happened with Maggie Gylenhal in the Dark Night.Samuel L. Jackson playing Nick Fury has a bigger role, and it leads all the viewers into wanting The Avengers movie to come out immediately. Scarlett Johansson also showed up with some impressive stunt work, along with her always gorgeous looks.All in all it was a well done sequel. The plot is not too convoluted to follow. The new villain, played by Mickey Rourke, is very impressive and fun to watch. The action scenes are all entertaining but they do not completely drive the movie. The only thing that I wished for leaving the theater was a longer final fight scene.Also, make sure to watch after the credits!! It is short, but worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Awesome suits,"This movie contains some throughly enjoyable moments that are on par with some of Downey Jnr's highlights as Tony Stark. The relationship between Pepper and Tony is taken further and built upon brilliantly in this movie. It contains some really cool and innovative action scenes which are taken for granted now. However the poor villain, a pattern in Iron Man Solo Outings, and the lack of direction meant this is easily the poorest Iron Man Performance. It's still an entertaining watch but you wouldn't be wrong if you skipped this movie when rewatching MCU Classics.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Great beginning and end, not so great in the middle","At its high points - the first act and the climax - Iron Man 2 is actually better than the first film. Everything up to and including the action scene in Monaco is just great fun to watch: the action, the character interactions, and of course Robert Downey Jr's wonderful portrayal of Tony Stark. And the action scene at the end is pretty epic.The problem is, the film just stops being so much fun in-between. In a large proportion of this time, it's either going too slowly with little happening that's exciting or even particularly interesting, or it's providing some silly moments like Iron Man lounging on a giant display donut. To be fair, there's no problem with the many subplots this movie has: they all blend together quite smoothly.The acting in this film deserves credit: almost everybody does a great job. Robert Downey Jr and Gwyneth Paltrow are just as entertaining as they were in the first film, Jon Favreau gets more to do as Stark's chauffeur, Don Cheadle is actually a little better than Terrence Howard as Rhodie (again, maybe because he has a bigger role), Mickey Rourke portrays a decent but overall ordinary villain, and once Scarlett Johansson is allowed to do something substantial with her own action sequence, she's well worth watching. The only weak link is Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, who gets quite annoying after a while.Overall, Iron Man 2's slow middle section prevents it from being better than the first film as a whole, which is a shame considering how brilliant the beginning and end segments are.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Solid action-packed funny sequel,"I liked it a lot better than the mixed reviews I was reading would have led me to believe. It's not as fresh as the original, but the charisma and humor were there, and so were some great surprises. RDJ was amazing as always - it's hilarious that Iron Man is a funnier superhero than Spiderman, but the improv makes it work. Thumbs up! I think that anyone who enjoyed the first movie will like this as well, and enjoy a great thrill ride! And don't forget to stay after the credits for yet another Marvel movie tie-in that leads towards the inevitable Avengers movie in 2012! Don Cheadle did a good job - ScarJo was good, but not what I imagined the Black Widow to be like, but she *was* hot... And Gwyneth did her usual impeccable job. Mickey Rourke added weight to what could have been a cardboard cutout stereotype, and Sam Rockwell's character, though annoying, was well played.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Clash, Bang, Boom! Tony Stark is back.....","Jon Favreau knew exactly what he was doing with this movie. This is a sleek, no-holds barred superhero movie, with great performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke. Let's face it, it was almost impossible to top the first one; nevertheless this a good sequel to one of the best superhero movies ever made.Scarlett Johansson fulfilled her role as the the sexy and cunning agent Natasha Romanoff, and Gwyneth Paltrow is fine as Pepper Potts. Sam Rockwell plays Tony Stark's competitor, and does a pretty good job at it.The only problem I have with this movie is that too many things have been fitted into 124 minutes. I understand that the movie was meant to be a roller-coaster ride, intended to thrill, but a little more character development would certainly have helped the movie. For example Samuel L. Jackson ans Johansson's characters are underused. Also, the ending was a little disoriented and predictable; something just didn't feel right about it.All in all, Jon Favreau has made a movie that would please the fanboys and satisfy the critics. This is a movie that entertains, while still complementing the first movie, and setting up a third movie. If you liked the first movie, just go ahead and watch this movie - you won't see a masterpiece, but you'll have a fun day at the movies.P.S.- Watch out for the after credits scene",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Nutshell Review: Iron Man 2,"Downey Jr continues his smirky role as the playboy and laissez-faire persona of Tony Stark (no Downey Jr, no Tony Stark I'd say!), now facing a life-threatening intoxication situation, and constantly having to deflect the US military's interest in and compelling him to turn over the Iron Man suit. Then of course there's the romantic angle with Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts who gets expanded screen time here, to whom he hands over Stark Industries to by appointing her CEO. I had enjoyed all the scenes between Paltrow and Downey Jr as they shared great chemistry, and didn't mind that the film took the pause from the action to throw the spotlight on this. In fact, Stark is pretty much the Santa Claus in giving away things, having to face his mortality and to put some business continuity plans into motion. A little too bad that the scene in the teaser trailer highlighting the banter in the plane didn't make it to the final cut.But all work and no play makes him a grumpy soul, so enter Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman, his new sexy private secretary from the legal department who is more than meets the eye. Johansson has now proved that she's got it in her to be in an action film, and her limited action scenes here will surprise and leave you breathless. Mickey Rourke seem to have picked off from his Wrestler role in playing the Russian villain Ivan Vanko, riding on the parallel and theme of Fathers and Sons, whose father was seemingly played out by Howard Stark, and is finding it apt to finally take it out on Stark Industries using similar technology the earlier generation developed, and now backed by sugar daddy industrialist Justin Hammer, played by Sam Rockwell. Rockwell plays the classic business rival bitterly humiliated by Tony, and from observing Ivan's potential, decided to bankroll the Russian's capability for the US military. Hating a man in common make for strange bedfellows indeed.Cameo wise, there's Stan Lee if you can spot him in a brief moment, probably his easiest and non event-filled one to date given he's just standing around, Samuel L. Jackson continuing his role as Nick Fury of SHIELD, now assessing Tony Stark to determine if he's indeed the man they need for his top secret boy band, Gary Shandling as the senator pursuing the weaponization of the Iron Man suit for the military, and of course, director Jon Favreau himself who continues his role as Stark's chauffeur Happy Hogan, and you can tell his acting itch from his expanded role in getting in on the fun rather than just solely standing behind the camera.But of course the tongues will wag whether Don Cheadle can pick up from where Terrence Howard left off. Whatever the reason may be for the latter's departure, he will likely be kicking his behind now for leaving the project. That anticipatory look Rhodes had in the first film at the metal suit worn would bring a smile to any fanboy in the know of what would be the next logical step, and frankly speaking I would have enjoyed some continuity here. But having a different actor in a role done by someone else in a preceding film isn't something new, and Cheadle stepped in confidently from the start, helped by the script which puts it in point blank terms that he's there now, and they should move on. Well said, and great job on being War Machine, in a best-friends-temporal fallout subplot which accounted for the action at the midway mark.Justin Theroux, who wrote the screenplay for Tropic Thunder, took over the scriptwriting for this film, doing the narrative justice with plenty of fan-moments, and oh-not-so subtle merchandising opportunities that Tony Stark would be proud of. The excellent casting has the brilliance of Theroux's story to thank for in keeping the many subplots in check, making Marvel fans happy through the plenty of easter eggs peppered around, coming up with an intoxication of a different sort for Tony Stark to deal with and a chance for him to go back to the drawing board, getting his hands dirty with the building of something.Action-wise, yes there is only a handful of them, but each of them brought something to the table in terms of excitement, thrills and spills. The special effects and graphics here were one up against the previous film, and it was a definite visual feast especially when suits got up against suits, warranting a second look at the film just to catch everything that's happening at the same time. The finale was a full 30 minutes worth of action end to end and features the Iron Man-War Machine tag team up, which served up a lot more than what we've all glimpsed from clips here and there. Singapore, this is yet another opportunity to be proud of with our compatriots also involved in the visual effects department, ala Kick-Ass.Iron Man 2 is set to convert the non-fan, and is crafted so that newcomers to the hero could jump right into the fun without needing to watch the first one (why haven't you!). For Marvel fans though, you have Jon Favreau to thank for whetting all our appetites in making this film the teaser to the other upcoming Marvel films such as Captain America, Thor, and I will be right there to holler Avengers Assemble! when the time comes. Stay until the end of the credits for a scene which will make you salivate. A-One!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
And that's coming from a neutral viewer:Iron Man's astonishing return!,"At first, when a heard about a second installment, i thought, i was unsure in it, because Jon Favreau is relatively new on the director's chair, so could he pull of another classic superhero movie?The answer is simple-YES! I saw it in its opening day and the theatre was full.I went along with a few friends, and all of them loved it!Here are some things, we all agreed we liked.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT:It was pretty good in this movie-making aspect, although it is an action movie, there is some quite exciting development, especially the leads.Don Cheadle made a perfect substitute of Terrence Howard, and looked pretty good in the movie.So did the Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlet Johansson's heroines.For me, Scarlet is one of the most gifted and talented and in the same time, the most beautiful actresses in the last decade and even more.And last, but not least, of course, the Iron Robert Downey Jr., making one of his unique, specifically for him, roles.He is smart, funny and in the same time, well, action hero type of guy-he adds so much to this otherwise, stereotyped role.Sam Rockwell was a little irritating, but that's what his role is supposed to be, and to those who have doubts, yes, Mickey Rourke made a decent and interesting role again.TIMING:Almost perfect, except, maybe, the opening credits and a few over timed scenes afterwards, everything was alright and on the perfect spot.PLOT/STORY:I finally can say it-YES, the day has come.A day, where superhero movies haven't got just CGI, put a pretty decent story, attached to the normal amount of CGI.Well, hard to say normal, a little bit over-the-top, but nonetheless fun, when you get use to the headache.The humor was perfect, brilliantly touched to the smallest line.And most importantly-it's not that predictable-i don't mean the ending, but the development, leading to it.Excecutet skilfully, when looked from this point of view.CGI:10/10, nothing else to add.Believable Flawless.Perfect.With no big flaws or plot holes, very funny dialogue, skillful acting and good directing, Iron Man is definitely the best movie of the year so far.The perfect blockbuster as well.I'm glad a saw it, and if the first one didn't made me a fan, this one did.I can't wait to see it again.Cheers to Iron Man Amazing! I would've given this a ten, but with some very few weaknesses, i'll lower this a little, although it did make me a bigger fan than before...My rate: 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Really good sequel,"It isn't as good as the original but Iron Man 2 is still a really good sequel. Robert Downey Jr. once again gives an incredible performance and is extremely charismatic. Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson and Sam Rockwell all give great performances. Jon Favreau's direction is really good and it's consistently funny. The CG is impressive and the music by John Denney is good. However, Mickey Rourke is wasted as a forgettable villain and the final battle is a little short.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Doesn't reclaim the originality and fun of the original, but it'll do.","I went to go see this with a friend on Saturday night. Now, I heard the film from others that this a step or two below the original, but I went in with an open mind. By the time the movie was over, I was pleased. But then, after thinking about it more, this is a disappointment. The film is drastically different in pace. Honestly, it gets a bit of a bore for awhile, which never happened in the original. Sometimes, its just hard to take this film seriously as a superhero film. In my opinion, the overwhelming number of laughs and silliness in this film makes it hard to take seriously. There is a large list of new things in this sequel. First, we learn much more about Tony Stark's father than we ever did in the original. Its quite interesting. Jon Favreau has a much, much bigger role in this film than the original, and I absolutely loved his role in the film. We learn his character has a personality. The talented Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodey,and I actually liked him better in the role. They both seem so different in the role. There's Scarlette Johansson as Black Widow. I was honestly disappointed with her role in the film. It was too small, I thought. Mickey Rourke is raw and sinister as Whiplash, the main villain, and its a perfect fit. He does an absolutely perfect Russian accent. Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer is a good fit for the most part, although it was hard for me to take his character seriously after awhile as a villain. Sometimes, it seems like all his character does is be funny. Samuel L. Jackson has a much bigger role in this film as Nick Fury (he had a credit ending scene in the original). In a way it succeeds over the original, but for the most part it doesn't. It's missing some of the excitement and originality that made the original a truly great achievement in film. This is quite a bit different from the first, and you may not like how different it is. I certainly didn't. Many new actors, and a whole different type of ballgame. There's a bit, I think, too much silliness in this film. But still, it'll do. Go see this. Its not as fun as the first, but its not as disappointing as Spider Man 3 was. And do be sure to stay after the credits if you're a fan of Marvel Comics. Make sure you notice Stan Lee's cameo in this as well. Its rather brilliant. Overall, good film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Very mediocre and didn't live up to the hype,"Iron Man 2 isn't as bad of a movie that people say it is, although it isn't great either.
It is one of the weakest movies in the MCU, which was a surprise especially when Iron Man 1 was one of the best MCU movies.Tony stark doesn't have the same motivations and doesn't care if people get hurt, which is completely out of character for him, since he started being a Superhero because he realized how many people his weapons were harming.Not a good movie, watch it only if you really like Robert Downey Jr. Otherwise skip this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I like it... a lot,"I went to the premiere last night and maybe it's because I've just discussed the movie with some friends that I'm still excited about it, but I truly enjoyed it. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll only state that there's old,new and more depth. That said I may be a bit on the generous side regarding my score, but it contains some of my favorite actors and the performances to go along with it.Downey Jr performance is excellent and Rourke(!) is still a hero, though my Russian is much better. ;) The incredibly beautiful ladies in this movie are as stated. One thing I thought was a pity was that Scarlett Johansson could've been given more time on the big screen, but maybe next movie will sort that out.I'm not one to criticize the directors vision and I won't, seeing as it's like the last movie, but more fun stuff. The Stark character has some funny moments that you don't want to end. Cheadle and Downey seems to have a chemistry that really works, but it may be good performances (what acting is all about).Marvel action at its best and yes... I'm easily amused.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Excellent again,"I am big lover of superhero movies and I really enjoy in them and it looks like I found myself in them . I like when I see Batman,Spiderman or maybe Iron Man . I was very surprised when last year I read article in newspapers that in 2010 is coming Iron Man 2 . This is one of the most expected movie in this year . I am surprised with more one fact . Why is movie coming a week earlier in Europe than in USA . I decided that I will watch this movie because I expected it so long . Then I saw trailer in cinema and I knew that it will be something spectacular . I was so excited and I didn't want to miss it .When I saw this movie I knew it that I can't be disappointed . Whole first impressions were great and I thought that I will again watch one masterpiece . This movie is something what I can't miss . There are maybe few things which made this movie a bit worse but I don't mind it .Jon Favreau directed this movie and he acted Happy Hogan . His directing is always full of imagination and great sense for entertainment . His funny appearance entertained me . I can still say that he didn't screw this serial . I can also say that his directing was completely different from first one because from one simple movie we got one big astonishment . I knew that i can't be disappointed with his directing . I can still say that his connecting of every part was on higher level and he got the best from whole cast .Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man was again excellent . Looks like he is enjoying in acting of this superhero . I can see that he isn't missing chance of his life because now he showed how he can be so good . Actually I like his performance from Sherlock Holmes and Iron Man . His sense for fun and great action made this movie great . I couldn't believe that from one I can say boring acting to great relaxed acting . He is again showing simplicity of one superhero . He was so realistic .Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko was great . No matter what I liked performance by Jeff Bridges but Rourke was definitely better . He made this movie great . His damn good performance deserved award ""The Best Villain in 2010"" . I can say that every his appearance was superb . If someone made this movie more amusing than first that was him . I think that he is definitely great choice by Jon Favreau . His convincing acting and something what is called sense for acting was great . I can see that he was on level .Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts was again in one difficult role and she acted her role the best that she could . I can see that she was on level maybe sometimes she had some failures but again something what we could see in first part . Her role was difficult but she found herself in it . Maybe she wasn't the best part of movie but I can't say that her performance is bad . She sometimes was in some her world but good performance .Don Cheadle as War Machine or Rhody was pretty convincing . His acting was in some cool style and I was fond of it . He surprised me so much because I didn't expect strong performance by him . There were so much parts when he was on level . I was surprised because he made big progress because of weak performance by Terrence Howard in first part . He was also great choice by Jon Favreau . I think that this movie is really better made .Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman was pretty good . She had good performance no matter what her appearance was based on her beauty what is definitely truth . Maybe sometimes she had some downs but many times she had her ups . I was very surprised because she was in some hand entertaining . Her movements were good and every scene was delighted with some her sense for appearance . I think that she is so good actress .Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury wasn't so good but he had a style . He is definitely valuable actor and you can see how his sense for acting .I think that this movie was the best of superhero movies .",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 2 Kicks-Ass,"I'll put it very simply, I think this movie was really cool. Excellent story, visual effects, action, all of it combined masterfully to create a great film that delivers entertainment and style throughout, without sacrificing a good plot. It has all the right elements and the cool elements in a proper balance making it fun yet not dumb.I liked a lot Iron Man 1 and I think if you also did so, then you would most likely like this one too. I really like films of this genre like Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Hellboy 2, Watchmen and I think both Iron Man films are up to the level. It's great to see that this sequel is as good or even better than the first one.I absolutely recommend this movie, it kicks major ass.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Don't listen to critics, this is one of Marvel's Best","With Marvel now having 15 movies out right now, there is a lot of people on the internet always criticizing Iron Man 2 on websites & YouTube. Don't listen to them. They are wrong.You have to realize the time period when this came out. Iron Man was such a monster success and as us comic book fans, we finally got War Machine in a film. Not only that, but they incorporated Tony Stark's alcoholism into the story line which was fantastic. Iron Man 2 was THE COMIC BOOK movie at that point. I remember everyone talking about it in 2010 and loving it. It did extremely well in box office. Mickey Rourke was fresh off of his Oscar nomination from The Wrestler. Sam Rockwell just did Moon. Don Cheadle was a very acceptable replacement for War Machine.The review of this film is that this is a great comic book film. People were still in awe over The Dark Knight just two years ago, and this was more light hearted and fun. Dark Knight was depressing and dark. This was upbeat and entertaining. Mikey Rourke as Whiplash was fantastic. And his character interacting with Sam Rockwell was brilliant. They are two of my favorite actors so I'm a bit biased. Don Cheadle was actually better than Terrence Howard. And of course Robert Downey Jr and Paltrow were amazing as usual. The film's story was great. Whiplash had Tony's technology and this caused the Government to find the excuse to shut down Tony. Meanwhile, besides external forces trying to shut down Tony, he is battling alcoholism and his own struggle with the metal possibly killing him. Besides the inner demons and Govt, but Whiplash is out for revenge toward Tony. He is the Russian counterpart to Tony, brilliant, but different version of Tony Stark. Tony's rival, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) is competing with Tony in making the most advanced weapons.The movie has Tony against the ropes. Alcoholism, Whiplash against him, Govt against him, Justin Hammer trying to take him over, his physical problems with the reactor killing him, and his affection for Pepper Potts that can not bloom due to personal issues. So much going against Tony. This inner struggle and external struggle leads to one of the best Marvel movies.The film introduces us to a deeper perspective of SHIELD led by Nick Fury who has his first decent part in a Marvel film rather than a cameo. Also, the introduction of Black Widow who goes onto to play a huge role in the MCU. Agent Coulson gets a bigger part. And there is a few tie ins to the future Marvel movies such as Capt America, Thor and Avengers (critics bashed these subplots, but ITS A COMIC BOOK MOVIE that is staying true to the source material, I enjoyed it!) Critics also said the movie didn't have enough action, but this is another part I completely disagree. The action was just enough. The race track scene was one of the most memorable action scenes in all of MCU. Iron Man 2 wasn't support to be a Transformers movie or a dumb Zack Snyder DC film, its about the character of Tony Stark and his struggles. And this film nailed it.So why all the hate ? Because people tend to have short term memory. People are so spoiled with the Avengers movies, Guardians, so many sequels for the solo heroes, more solo origin stories - that Iron Man 2 got left behind in many people's heads. They don't remember how awesome it actually was to see War Machine for the first time. They don't remember how cool it was to see Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell as villains. To sum it up - people have short term memory and are spoiled. The idiots over at Collider are in their 40's and can't even remember anything beyond 2 years ago.In the end, Iron Man 2 is a fun entertaining film. Perhaps I'm biased because I had such a great time in 2010 seeing this film in theaters and getting really big into the Iron Man franchise (I'm a Batman & Spider-Man fan). But this movie just worked so well for me. I smiled the entire time watching it.Now Iron Man 3 ? That is a terrible film. I get offended when people put IM 2 and IM 3 in the same category as 'bad ones'. Iron Man 2 is NOT a bad film, its a GREAT film and one of my favorites in the MCU.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Something's missing,"There's RDJ and his immeasurable charisma, there's Rockwell and Rourke rocking their lines, there's classy Paltrow and shallow ScarJo (bait for the horny nerds), there's good action.. and yet, something's missing. Don't get me wrong: this movie is FUN, from beginning to end. Too much talking? No way. Not enough action? Maybe, but there's plenty (2 fights, 1 'friend ruckus'). But the thread that ties it all together don't seem to be that strong (I blame it on Theroux). Anyway, go see it, you won't regret. One more thing: don't believe people telling that this movie talks way too much about the Avengers: a few bits here and there is not too much. And stay for the after-credits scene.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another magnificent superhero sequel.,"Reading Iron Man 2's plot summary, things sound bleak for our characters. But not at all. This is a breezy, light-hearted, inoffensive affair that saunters at a magnetic pace, with emotional discomfiting a far thought. Which is pretty refreshing, to say the least. In fact, Iron Man 2 is the complete of antithesis of recent comic book movies. For one, it certainly isn't darker than its predecessor, absent its slow-burning first half and latched-on social commentary. It also gives itself the poetic license to stretch credulity. This is a movie about a man who flies around in metal suit, blasting away multicolored-haired Russians with electric whips. Realism simply doesn't apply, and thankfully director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux take affectionate liberty with the bonds of belief. Yes, Ivan Vanko can secretly build super technology unbeknownst to his suppliers. And yes, the only way to incapacitate a drunken Tony is to beat the crap out of him in a Iron Man suit. No complaints here!Iron Man 2 is also very much Iron Man's superior, although partly by default. The first movie was stuck with a pedantic origin story. However, the sequel had no shortage of possible paths to take. Which did it choose? The way you should always go; the road of characterization. Rather than tediously expand upon its universe, Iron Man 2 simply reprises its dramatis personae and sticks them into situations graver than before, upping the ante but reiterating the overall heart and spirit of its predecessor. The characters are well-etched, each snappy exchange rendered with a mature pathos that contrasts with the spurious scenarios that they feature in between of. Iron Man 2 could easily be called a comedy, but the naturalism of the comedy is seamless; you get the sense that it would be impossible to write this movie without having these vibrant characters joke and jeer.To bring the clever screenplay to life is the phenomenal cast. Robert Downey, Jr., as always, is effortlessly captivating. Charisma defined and an scandalously unsung master of versatility (he's not just playing himself, people!), it's no breaking news that he's still one of the most watchable actors ever. He is the perfect Tony Stark, and a more-than-worthy representative of the thinking man's action star. His chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow as the pragmatic Pepper Pots is electric, and she too turns in a fine performance. Wistful, but by no means a damsel in distress, she is probably the realest character.The baddies, just as essential as the hero, don't disappoint either. Another wrong from last time round successfully remedied is the lack of genuinely menacing villains. Jeff Bridges honored us with his always-welcome presence in Iron Man, but his warm affability was anything but menacing. This time, however, Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell (oddly, both novices to blockbuster attention) are on duty, offering more than enough bang for your villainy buck. Rourke as Anton Vanko/""Whiplash"", supplements a composite of the unintentionally hokey showman, supercilious mastermind, and the seemingly unstoppable behemoth. This effectively fends off one-noteness, and Rourke perfectly embodies the duality of Vanko's deceptively boorish visage and surprisingly vast intellect, while still indulging in the welcome irreverence that comes with the comic book villain (his Russian drawl is humorous but gives him an otherworldly conviction).Rockwell, on the other hand, is flat-out comic relief as Stark's weaselly rival – though not necessarily a threatening one – Justin Hammer. He is excellent in the part; an absolute delight to watch, whether irascibly mugging in a loss for words with his insubordinate partner Vanko or, in one of the movie's best moments, shamelessly accolading his own (faulty) inventions with juvenile zeal.Unfortunately, with all these characters butting heads for screen time, co-stars Don Cheadle and Scarlett Johansson as Tony's pal Colonel James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes and eventual partner War Machine and alluring temptress of a new assistant Natalie Rushman, respectively, are given the short straw. Both are more than able of carrying a scene, but while the script lavishes Tony with many moments in which to brood his way into some fine character development, and to convey Pepper's many grievances, neither supporting character is as lucky. Cheadle's moments of potential are all obstructed by the War Machine suit, and everything otherwise requires him to lucidly voice reason as a foil to the devil may care Tony. Johansson is a non-event, her Natalie Rushman an amoral nothing role, and her Black Widow guise is not so much daring femme fatale as listless sex symbol. She acts as merely a vessel for fan service, be it in her skintight suit for the general audience or that she represents another stepping stone to an Avengers movie for esoteric comic book fans.The movie is inter cut between the scenes of terse characterization and octane action. The latter is a dizzying combination of rapid vicissitudes and toe-to-toe skirmishes, high on CGI, low on genuine peril. In fact, Iron Man 2 could quite possibly have been a masterpiece of the genre had it lived up to its first forty minutes of exuberance and intrigue. But once the clumsy pugilism of Iron Man and Whiplash takes place, the movie falls flat. The power play is nonexistent, because it's hard to believe anyone could stand a chance against ol' Shellhead. And if no sense of alarm can be conveyed when Iron Man is caught in an unusually melee showdown, the flight sequences leave no impression. Yes, the special effects are astounding, but it's all for nothing if there's no dramatic undercurrent.Otherwise, please, don't mistake my raving for fanboy hyperbole; Iron Man 2 is great. It's well-written, well-acted, and simultaneously a loving throwback to comic book norm and a break from recent tradition. It's a rare occurrence to be thankful for, because God knows if this follows the superhero trilogy formula, the third one will suck. Which would tragically make this movie's thrilling departure from cliché null and void.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel Gets Mediocre Sometimes,"Iron Man 2 has plenty of epic scenes - new heroes and villains making insane entrances, a beginning cameo that sparks intrigue in fans, fights that really keep people interested, and a couple suit ups that should go down in history. But altogether, the movie doesn't have much to it. It's poorly written. Sam Rockwell made a fun introduction to Marvel as Justin Hammer, a major villain for Robert Downy Jr.'s Iron Man. Hammer is joined with Mickey Rourke's Whiplash, which isn't something I'll complain about, but both villains are a little boring. This entire movie is just Tony Stark's past coming to haunt him, and it doesn't make for a good story. There's plenty of epic moments, as I've said before, but they don't mop up the poorly written movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Very good, but sadly not as good as Iron Man 1","I'm really torn between a rating of 7 and 8 and should probably see it again before a final verdict. But my initial feeling is this one had too much talk and too little heart.While there certainly was more action, the action scenes - especially the last - did not feel threatening at all. The one possible exception to this is the first battle between Iron Man and Whiplash - the one on the race track from the trailer.The main problem is probably too much dialog, possibly too much happening, and too little heart. Too few quiet moments. I'm not sure.My guess is the film makers heard that people loved the humor from the first (which was mostly ad-libbed from the actors) but missed more action. So they apparently gave the whole cast (of GREAT actors all around!) free reign to talk up as much as they want in each and every scene. And they added action sequence after action sequence to make up for the mere two major sequences from Iron Man 1.The end result was slightly underwhelming, yet almost satisfying.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
*A Charged Sequel with Growing Pains*,"!! Possible Spoilers!!*Iron Man 2* picks up shortly after the events of its predecessor, finding Tony Stark basking in the glow of his newfound hero status. However, the film quickly reveals a darker underbelly to the billionaire playboy's life. His reliance on the Arc Reactor, the power source for his Iron Suit, is slowly poisoning him, while the demands of the public and the military put immense pressure on Stark Industries.Mickey Rourke delivers a menacing performance as Ivan Vanko, a bitter Russian scientist seeking revenge against Stark for his father's downfall. Vanko's creation, the Whiplash suit, proves to be a formidable opponent for Iron Man. The film also introduces Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury in a more prominent role, laying the groundwork for the Avengers initiative.While Downey Jr. Continues to shine as the charismatic and witty Tony Stark, the film struggles to maintain the same level of originality and excitement as its predecessor. The plot becomes increasingly convoluted as it juggles multiple storylines, including Stark's personal struggles, the threat of Vanko, and the introduction of new characters like Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and War Machine (Don Cheadle).The action sequences are undeniably impressive, with the iconic climax featuring multiple Iron Suits battling it out. However, the film's pacing suffers at times, and the overall tone is less focused than the first installment. Additionally, the resolution of the palladium poisoning plot point feels somewhat rushed and anticlimactic.Key plot points:-* Tony Stark's dependency on the Arc Reactor
* The introduction of Ivan Vanko and the Whiplash
* The development of the War Machine armor
* Black Widow's first appearance in the MCU
* The increasing involvement of Nick Fury and

Johansson and Jackson indicted for scene stealing,"Java Man Reviews ""Iron Man 2""Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com May, 2010.OVERVIEW:While the identity of most super heroes remains shrouded in mystery, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.) has been publicly revealed as the breast-plated bad-boy known as Iron Man. Unlike Batman or Spiderman, Stark has to deal with things like Senate hearings, jealous G-Men and rival CEOs. Everyone wants the Iron Man technology. Meanwhile, over in Russia, a metallic mastermind named Ivan (Rourke) is steeling himself to challenge Stark for world supremacy. Returning from the original Iron Man are Stark's trusted assistant Pepper Potts (Paltrow) and army liaison ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Cheadle). New characters are Natasha Romanoff (Johansson) and Nick Fury (Jackson) both of whom add a big dose of scene-stealing appeal.REVIEW: 3 of 4 Java MugsSequels are inevitably compared to their originals and more often than not they don't measure up. Because of the cast, this one could have been an exception: Downey is still a marvel to watch and Paltrow may be even better in this version; Cheadle, who replaces Terrence Howard, is also fine. Rourke and Rockwell as villains and Jackson and Johansson as intriguing spy types are all fascinating; and Shandling as the chairman of a Senate investigating committee is hilarious. But the screenplay is very much by-the-numbers, and it just doesn't add up. The captivating characters and stimulating situations which distinguished the original have given way to long and loud action sequences.But if it's action you want, you've got it; these scenes are very well done and are accompanied by lots of heavy metal music (what else?). The cinematography is also noticeably sharp with a lots of excellent aerial views. Great location work in and around California, and in Monaco during the principality's Grand Prix, also adds to the film's visual vitality.I waited in a long line to see this movie, but it was worth it because of the enthusiastic audience that surrounded me. Come early to get a good seat--and stay late through the end credits for a big hint at what may be coming next from the franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Pure Masterpiece!,"This is, without a doubt going to be one of my top 10 movies of 2010, quite possibly the number one film. I really can't see anything that could possibly top this film. One of my favorite movie going experiences EVER. I was thrilled with Iron Man back in 2008 but this takes that experience and adds to it. I'm so happy to report that unlike other sequels made only for a cash grab, Iron Man 2 delivers on every front possible. There is no doubt why IM2 will be the box office smash of 2010. With good reason, the film is well worth the price of admission, more so then any movie I've seen in years. Director Jon Favreau has done it again, with great style and flair. The new actors are injected perfectly. Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell and even good old Garry Shandling are exceptional. We all knew Scarlett Johansson could handle the sex appeal but she's especially good as Tony's new assistant/SHIELD operative. Don Cheadle trumps Terrance Howard's Rhodey in every way. I'm also relieved to report that Robert Downey Jr. and Gwenyth Paltrow are even more amazing in their lead roles. They've really grown in to embodying these wonderful characters. What many don't realize but soon will is that this film has tremendous depth. The lead characters all respond to turmoil and are fleshed out beautifully. Judging by the commercials, people may expect wild action but they are going to be pleasantly surprised at the complexity and depth of the film itself. What only adds to the experience is the fact that they managed to deliver fun in to the equation. This masterpiece is one of those rare summer event movies that really does deliver something for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What was promised- and more.,"To classify Iron Man 2 as an archetypal sequel wouldn't justify the effortlessness in which it flows seamlessly from the original Iron Man's story; the film takes pride in picking up straight from where its predecessor left off, and in beautiful fashion. As a whole, IM2 feels more of an add-on to its predecessor and focuses on tackling the issues arising from the fallout incurred from the ending of original Iron Man.Having said that, audiences shouldn't just expect a hollow romp of recurring Stark-isms, repetitive action sequences and a predictable storyline. IM2 definitely has an edge over the original in its case of moral dilemmas and intertwining relationships between old and new characters, and to top this off the plot line of IM2 has so many unexpected and original turns that the film is so engaging it makes most other comic book adaptations appear sheepishly predictable.Having less opportunity to rely on Stark's antics to dazzle audiences, Robert Downey Jr. succeeds in adding a realistic amount of depth to Stark's character, and as such, the issues of alcoholism, sickness, mortality and the international weapons race can be tackled with a believable attitude by both the actor and the director. Thanks to a touch of genius from the writers, actors and director, these serious issues are tackled without compromising the fun, super-savvy feel of the Iron Man franchise.As a film, Iron Man 2 wasn't simply a carbon copy of Iron Man, and as such it wasn't what I expected. The film was approached in a much different way by those who made it and I think this is a very good thing. They've kept life in the Iron Man/Avengers franchise, introduced new characters without feeling like they are forcing Marvel memorabilia down your throat, and closed a dark episode in the Iron Man saga without changing the pace or tone of the franchise.For me, this movie marks a fantastic achievement for Favreau and Marvel Studios. I would definitely recommend this to anybody who enjoyed the original Iron Man.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Fun Way To Kickoff The Summer,"Tony Stark, is back in this high-octane, high action summer blockbuster. The film picks up right where the first one left off, where Stark reveals that he is Iron Man. We are introduced to a new villain named Whiplash played by Mickey Rourke. We soon find out that he and Mr. Stark have much in common with their past. Meanwhile Jimmy Rhodes, played wonderfully by Don Cheadle, must deal with the government and Stark's crazy antics. This is just a reader's digest version of the story, I want to talk about the film itself. This film is the first of this summer's blockbusters. This film is bigger, louder and more action packed than it's predecessor, which not necessarily a bad thing. With the addition of Sam Rockwell and Scarlett Johansson really brings a ""freshness"" to the story. Director Jon Favreau has done another fantastic job, proving that he is a first rate action director. The characters are great, Paltrow gives a great supporting performance, Downey is funny and series as ever, and Rourke is a force to be reckoned with. The visual affects are very good along with solid sound editing, however, I do feel that Johansson and Sam L. Jackson, where a but underutilized. I really enjoyed this film, but I was hoping to see more from these characters. That's what sequels are for. I do like this film, but it did lack in some parts where the first one succeeded. I do love the special affects, but they could have been better. Unfortunately with the passing of special affects wizard, Stan Winston, who worked on the first film, it did loose a little luster but not much. Overall I was a satisfied as a moviegoer and a future film maker, I would definitely go see this film again. It is worth your money, but unfortunately, it will probably be overshadowed by the mind-numbing, horribly acted, D rated special affects, crapfest known as ""Twilight"". But hey, that is my opinion, and I'm sure people have other opinions, and that's OK.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
EVERYTHING you would want in a movie and much more!,"The makers of this film held nothing back. When it works, as it does here, it rekindles even a cynic's movie love. So kudos to Downey, Paltrow, Cheadle, Scar-Jo, Rockwell, Rourke and especially Favreau. What a film! It is a sight to behold. Every scene was captivating, whether it was full on armor action or the charismatic ""down time"" delivered by the best cast possible. Isn't that what movies are suppose to be about? It's good to see the response to the movie has been, for the most part, positive. I've noticed that sometimes expectations are unreasonable or some fans are too attached to their comic book preconceived notions. (X-Men and Wolverine fans I'm looking right at you!) Iron Man 2 stayed close enough to its roots and I hope most judge it as a film first. If you do, I'm almost certain that everyone will enjoy it as much as I did.It easily fulfilled and then exceeded all of my expectations. The only thing I worry about is that they may be setting expectations for that Avengers movie too high. How can it possibly live up to the standard these movies are setting and setting up????? Iron Man 2 is EVERYTHING you would want in a movie and much more! It is a special treat when a sequel reaches up and delivers an excellent film that you thoroughly enjoy as much if not more than a beloved first installment. It truly feels like they just paused and kept telling the same story but with more of an edge. Hopefully, they can do it again and skip that third movie curse. Think of it as another installment and they'll be fine. Fitting Avengers in to the mix is even more fun to think about but I heard that Favreau will be involved with that as an executive producer. So, I'm not worried. In the meanwhile, we can all enjoy this film because it stands on its own but as a great part of a running saga.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is how the Super Hero movies are supposed to be,"I really liked this movie with one exception, too much unnecessary comedy. I liked how they spiced it up with all the giggles, but some of it was just too much, and it retracted from the seriousness that Iron Man is supposed to be. I also heard that black widow was useless, and her character was necessary. I was at first upset that she didn't have the accent, but it would probably conflict with Rourke's character, so its acceptable. But overall the acting was great, especially on Rourke's part, and the FX were great. And to be honest, I like Cheadle better than Howard as Rhoades, they should have gotten him in the first place.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Tony is BACK!,"Once again Tony Stark is back with his Narcissist behavior. This movie was great from the beginning to the end. It is a great super hero popcorn flick, but it's not a great film.

It has personality, unlike other super hero movies who try to be serious (And copy the dark knight that succeeded with being serious) but in the end fails because you can't take these kind of Super heroes serious.When they made this movie, they didn't try to make it serious, instead they made it funny and entertaining, like a superhero movie should be (Except Nolan's Batman series). This movie has it's flaws, but it's still great. This movie was as great as the first Iron Man, but this contained more action and I thought that Robert Downey JR and Mickey Rourke was Awesome.

More of the same...but not.,"People faulted this film for being good, but not great. What the hell, so will I. Iron Man 2 has all the right ingredients to make a great summer blockbuster superhero film, yet the final product is more of what we already saw, minus the heart.Iron Man 2 has Tony Stark AKA Iron Man fighting off Ivan Vanko, a man hellbent on revenge, as well as a new arms dealer Justin Hammer. For the sake of cramming more characters in sequels, like all sequels do, we also have Natasha Romanoff/Natalie Rushman, better known as Black Widow.Black Widow, or the eye candy known as Scar Jo, adds nothing to the film for me. This was one of my worries, too much going on. Iron Man isn't overloaded like X-3 was, but it was getting there. The story is the classic revenge tale, with Mickey Rourke as the villain. A role he was only given because of his recent career revival with The Wrestler. If you watch The Expendables, you'll notice he looks exactly the same as he does here. Almost as if they were shooting next door and he wandered onto the set. Ivan, isn't that memorable as a villain (looks don't count). Rourke tried his best, but there just wasn't much there in the script.The action set pieces are entertaining enough to appeal to a younger audience. The threat level doesn't feel as big, with the addition of War Machine, again more stuff added, it just felt like we were waiting for Iron Man to succeed. The stakes simply weren't high enough for me to really care this time around.The party scene with Tony in the Iron Man suit, drunk and shooting off missiles in his house was laughable and was just added to have the two character fight each other. Superhero sequels tend to be a but better (X2, Spiderman 2) but this one just dropped the ball a bit. I don't know if the first one set the bar too high or if the filmmakers were just a bit lazy. Either way, we lost out a bit on this one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Pulp Fiction of Comic Book Films,"This Film from start to finish is genre perfection, the script the acting the cinematography the little bits of detail that makes a great film, the effects are out of this world, so good you don't even think about them. Overall this tops Spiderman 2 and by some distance i might add as the greatest comic book film to date.To start script is sharp witty, off the cuff, it quite often even verges into the Tarantino realm of dialog, so good are Downey JNR, Rockwell and Paltrow, that even the most menial of scenes become enjoyable, Rourke who was a worry for me was great not over the top and camp right on the money and also brought a great physical presence to his role. Johansson while looking the part, is the only weak point of the film for me, but even this is a minor note. But Rockwell, and Downey are close to perfection. With Rockwell having one of the better monologues in recent memory. Plot, pacing and coherence are perfect the movie just flew by didn't want it to end. There are no wasted scenes each is a treat onto itself no over indulgence or hammy dialog.Cinematography, mise'en scene, action, effects are all top notch. Sat in awe of how Iron man looks about four thousand times more realistic than spider-man, action has a really visceral impact without ever being choppy or shaky cam. Again cinematography is the major stand out and to quote R Lee Emmy film looked any better ""it would be a modern art masterpiece""Directing is great i am now a devoted follower of Faverau he has taken all the annoying clichés and boring formulas that we keep seeing in these movies, and given us an action movie with brains brawn and the patience and execution to back it all up. There are no cop outs or annoying walls of writing where you can tell script is out of ideas and they just plonk something on the page, this is thought to the T, there is so much detail here its hard to take it all in, this one of those films you can go back and watch fifty times. From Bill O'Reilly to Amanpour from CNN, to Larry Ellison. There is something in every frame.So summing up don't listen to the pandering,sycophantic reviewers all agreeing with each other this movie is a real treat, weather your ten twenty or even fifty years old there's enough here for everyone it doesn't treat you like a 2 year nor does it go all star trek with the tech speak.

Pure Awesomeness!!!!!!!!!,"This sequel is definitely up on par with The Dark Knight in my book. The story and acting is so believable that it seems as if they are the characters and the graphics are definitely upgraded from the original film!!! Then the armors and weapons all look as if Iron Man and War Machine could be reality. Now don't get me wrong there is a good amount of dialog in this film but it does the film and characters justice. So you'll really understand where the characters come from. Even though I thought Terrence Howard was great as Rhodey, Don Cheadle was just as good like I predicted. Mickey Rourke really shined in this role as he did in Sin City and The Wrestler, his presence gave the me the same reaction as Heathe Ledger did with The Joker just speechless.

This is not better or worse than the first one,"I can't say that this is better or worse than first one. One thing that Iron Man 2 is better than the first one is the action scenes. There are more robots to robots clashing in this one although they are a bit short and do not provide enough thrills. One thing Iron Man 2 does not have in the first one is the intensity of the story. This time, the story is not so fast, and in the middle, it drags. Jon the director tries to inject drama into this but in the end, it pulls the fast pace into a slower one. I am not saying it is bad but it just does not put justice to the first one which has a fun pace.The story: Like I said, this cannot be compared to the first, in fact. Since, Tony is back and he has bigger problems to deal including a villain. The first third of the movie is energetic including WhipSplash known as Ivan in a car racing scene. The second third of the movie is where the pace goes slower for Tony to deal with his personal problems and that gives time to Ivan to build robots. The last third is where Tony thankfully solves his major problem and prepares to suit up for the climax. It may not have the energy like the first one but it is still fun with new characters. John Debney,who replaces Ramin, creates an epic score for this one.Overall: It still entertains and has a lot of fun. I would say it is certainly a good sequel to the first while it is not comparable. This may be the only movie for your thirst of superheroes movies unless you count Jonah Hex in.

"It feels like Iron Man, It sounds like Iron Man, it looks like Iron Man yet something is missing","I was eager to find out if Iron Man 2 could become as good or even better than the first entry in the franchise like Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight. Unfortunately it is neither as good or better - a slight disappointment.Without going into detail, the 2nd arc drags on far too long and the character of Rhodey and the Black Widow go from A to Z without any real explanation. On the bright side of things Robert Downey Jr. still delivers the goods.The pacing is way off and so is the supposedly climax of the film. A huge letdown. Marvel didn't do itself a favor by rushing the sequel so fast. I think another year or so would've done the franchise justice.In so many ways Iron Man could've been to Marvel what Nolan's Batman is to DC a hit with the critics and fans alike. With this entry they dropped the ball. It's not the worst sequel - it's not FF 2 (that franchise stinks as a whole) but it isn't X2 either.Jon Favereau is still the man to direct the franchise but Justin Theroux must stay away from it.

Complete Action Package! Excellent and Entertaining!,"It is always exciting every time we watch Iron Man movie. Complete action package, great characters interest and interlude with effective humor. Tony Starks is an eccentric, self-centered but genius multi-billionaire who builds Iron Man suit. Thiz time, he faces health issue and ready to confront another thread from his business rival, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and mysterious villain Whiplash (Mickey Rourke). In the first Iron Man two years ago, I said to everyone that Tony Starks in that movie was too humanist, which was so wrong. Starks should appear more arrogant to present his original character (If you ask me thiz kind of stuff. Well, comic is my world. I recall when my dad bought me first Iron Man's issue from overseas). But at thiz sequel, Iron Man character really fills my expectation. Robert Downey Jr. acts amazingly well, improving his first appearance. The most powerful element in Iron Man's movies is simply Robert Downey Jr. himself. Mickey Rourke is our other attention after his breathtaking performance in ""The Wrestler"" (2008). He plays save for his villain character and it looks just fine. For the fight scene, Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is surprisingly kick ass. I don't know whether is the camera angle or the fight choreography that makes it so attractive, Johansson really left behind her girly image. Unfortunately, I don't like Nick Fury's character (Samuel L. Jackson) which is reconstructed from Nick Fury's original character. Other mentionable performances are Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle. The movie is directed by former Actor, Jon Favreau. His previous directing credits are ""Zathura: A Space Adventure"" (2005) and the comedy ""Elf"" (2003).

An exhilarating and funny superhero sequel.,"Iron Man 2 is a fine sequel. Almost the whole cast returns intact, and director Jon Favreau has more screen time in his role as Happy Hogan. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is riding high after the events of Iron Man (2008). He has become famous worldwide, and he re-institutes the Stark Expo. But problems begin to pile up. Another wealthy industrialist wants his Iron Man technology. Then a new villain appears. Stark's relationship with his assistant Virginia Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is also expanded upon. There's a lot going on in the film, but its rather weak script hurts it for sure. Mickey Rourke as the villain Ivan Vanko stands out. He's more menacing than Obadiah Stane was in the first film. Vanko's first encounter with Stark leads to a thrilling fight scene. Unfortunately Rourke's character isn't fully developed. This is a problem with other characters in the film as well. Vanko is a memorable villain but if Rourke was given more screen time and his character had more of a backstory I'm sure he could have been even more memorable. Still, Rourke tried to make his character as complex as he could.The film's special effects are excellent. Some of the time, however, they're used on shootouts and explosions that don't produce much excitement. There's a lot more humour this time around. I was smiling or laughing during most of the film. Scarlett Johansson as the beautiful Natasha Romanoff gets to show off some impressive martial arts moves. It's rather funny afterwards because no one else can fight like her. Overall, the film is not as good as Iron Man. Still, it's an entertaining summer blockbuster and the performances are solid. I wasn't expecting much from the film but was pleasantly surprised.

Iron Man 2 has all the exciting battle scenes and clever dialogue Iron Man did and even manages to make it better than the first.In Iron Man 2 Stark has to face off against the government for the rights to his own Iron Man suit while defending his life from new super-villain, Whiplash (Mickey Rourke).This film delves deeper into the character of Stark than the first film did. Stark's hidden alcoholism begins to come into play and Stark's relationship with his assistant, Pepper Pots (Gwyneth Paltrow), is expanded on.The premise of this movie isn't impressive. Whiplash is the son of a contemporary of Stark's father, Howard. Whiplash feels his father was forced out of business with Howard unfairly which is why he had to die in poverty. Whiplash is just the genius that Stark is and with the funding of Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), the CEO of Stark's rival company, he builds his own suit to rival the Iron Man suit.But Stark doesn't have to fight Whiplash alone. He has his old friend, James Rhodes (Don Cheadle), to help him. Rhodes steals an iron man suit from Stark and makes a few modifications and to the joys of comic fans everywhere enters War Machine. Iron Man 2 is nothing new for super-hero movies but it manages to prove that super-hero movies are not all bad. Iron Man 2 is just plain fun. The dialogue is better than the first Iron Man and same with the action sequences.Downey is perfect as Stark, no other actor could pull of his arrogant humor as well. The studio made a wise decision in replacing Terrence Howard with Don Cheadle as Rhodes. The two actors play the characters a little differently but Cheadle is ultimately better.Scarlet Johansson is also thrown into the mix as a government spy named the Black Widow. It seemed Johansson's sole purpose in the film was to be the 'hot girl fighting crime' that is stereotypical of all comic book movies.Samuel L. Jackson plays Nick Fury, a character who will mean a lot more to comic book fans than the average viewer. This movie has a lot of little moments the die-hard fans will love. Also true comic geeks should be sure to stay for the scene at the end of the credits.Iron Man 2 did what The Dark Knight did and proved that super-hero movies can actually be good film. Iron Man 2 is an exciting ride that should not be missed.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Outdated and predictable to a tee,"I could not watch this movie to the end because it was so boring and predictable that it made me sick. No storyline whatsoever. It was all over the place. I guess writers could not come up with anything, so they decided to copy all the old stuff they knew and dump it in one place. Prolonged dialogs about nothing. In the best traditions of Cold War propaganda that apparently is still alive with some oldtimers, Iron man is fighting against some soviet guy who speaks his native Russian with horrible American accent. They used every single stupid cliché possible. Saving poor scared child, strong independent women wiping floor with poor ""denutted"" men, retarded dialogs , very typical happy end of course. It was like when the character takes one step you already know what the second step will be and how it all will end. When i was watching this movie i thought that the screenplay writer must be or really old and stuck in some time that had long passed or if he is young he is very stupid and out of touch with reality.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Some of the Shine Is Off,"With the eye-popping special effects front and center, we need to again delve beneath the surface and figure what separates this from other blockbuster superhero movies. This is a fairly captivating effort, but it doesn't really advance things that much. I suppose Robert Downey looked tired because he was, after all, dying in the film, but I also got that little bit of smugness that comes from walking through the part. Still, there's a great villain who can match well and some great technology to keep things interesting. One of the demands of this is to make your protagonist somewhat vulnerable. It falls just a bit short at times in catching us. Still, I liked the byplay and the fun and don't regret having seen it. I liked the first much better because it has a more sophisticated plot and substructure.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Only the churlish would complain!,"I saw this at a free preview in Singapore, so reviewing it seems like the least I can do. More importantly, not only was it great value for a free viewing, but I plan to pay to see it again later this week.Sequels almost always suck, so I was expecting to be disappointed, especially as I loved the first movie (and I'm not a comic book movie fan, generally).Robert Downey Jr is just great, again! Iron Man, and now IronMan 2, is warm, and funny, and entertaining... because Downey is.Supporting characters from last time (Paltrow, Cheadle, Favreau) were fine, and provided continuity. Cheadle had a bit more this time, so we got the bromance thang going.This time Stark's joined by a bunch of new characters. Sam Rockwell was thoroughly entertaining as his arch-rival Justin Hammer, very funny. Scarlett Johansson got to wear some skin-tight outfit as an ass-kicking Russian spy, nice. Samuel L. Jackson, shows up briefly (but very coolly) as a one-eyed spy boss. And the resurrected Mickey Rourke shows off his Russian accent as the vengeful genius with a grudge, and a neat turn in remote controlled drone (very topical) Iron Men.And let's not forget the Ironettes! Even the AC/DC soundtrack was OK (and I loathe AC/DC, they're so last century).If you liked Iron Man, you'll like Iron Man 2. What more do you want, buddy?",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
good enough sequel,"Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is back declaring that he has created world peace. The problem is that his arc reactor heart is killing him as fast as saving his life. And then there's Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) who is on a mission to avenge his father with superior arc technology.It's a good continuation sequel. I like Mickey Rourke as the new bad guy. He has the look and the menacing demeanor. I even like the accent. Sam Rockwell is normally a special actor, but his sleazy weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer feels very generic. And Garry Shandling is stupid as a Senator.Overall, it does feel a little bit bloat with the vast number of characters and the complicated history in this movie. There are a few characters they introduce that payoff in later movies. For example, Scarlett Johansson seems like nothing more than a simple T&A show. If not for the later movies, I would say she's a bad distraction.The fact is that it does two things all at once. It's Iron Man 2, but also pre-Avengers. And it does them both well enough. But like a ship with two masters, it can veer off at times. It could have been a great movie that is strictly Iron Man 2. But this is a good enough movie that advances both goals.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Puts the comics on the screen,"Tony (Iron Man) Stark and supporting cast have been continuously published for up to almost half a century now; there must be something entertaining and appealing about these characters. This movie (unlike some other comicbook adaptions this century - yes, ""Azrael Begins"", I'm looking at you) actually puts recognisable versions of the published characters on the big screen.If you've been reading Iron Man for decades, as I have, then there are many resonant moments and stirring visuals that will bring a smile to your face. I don't think you can go much more than 5 minutes at a stretch without experiencing some frisson of gleeful recognition.If all you know of the character is the first movie, this will not disappoint. It has the same mix of comicbook physics, great performances and entertaining action in another script smarter than the genre usually supplies. There's a layer of enjoyment accessible to long-time readers that you won't tap into, but you won't miss it.(It was great to see Howard Stark presented as the Walt Disney of the Marvel Universe here! Great cultural shorthand.) Superior popcorn entertainment masterfully done!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A predictable sequel that continues the story of the first film without, however, being as good as it is.","After an excellent first movie, this was a predictable sequel, but I have to admit that the movie is a bit over the top and that, sometimes, it feels like a very expensive video game. Furthermore, the main character, Tony Stark, is perhaps one of the nastiest and most irritating comic heroes, and this movie seems to try to accentuate that by turning the protagonist into a spoiled playboy who has expensive toys and looks at women like if they were, also, toys. Okay, I know the character was also portrayed like that in the original books, even though I'm not a comics fan. But the movie could give something that made Tony Stark someone we could really care about.In this film, the hero will face his first great antagonist, the son of a Soviet scientist that Stark's father knew. At the same time, Stark has to face the US Army, who are eager to get their hands on the combat suits he created, discovering that his father knew of a new chemical element, not yet officially discovered, and in which lies the key for the survival of Stark himself. With these brief lines, we can see, right away, that the script is not exactly one of the strong points of the film. The feeling that remains is that the script shoots in several directions, trying to create a more complex story, but that something got in the way and prevented that objective.The cast basically has the same names as the previous film. Robert Downey Jr. Is back to the red armor for yet another film, where he has shown himself to be deftly sarcastic and irritating without losing his heroic pose. Mickey Rourke is a welcome addition to the cast, playing the villain. The actor was able to adapt to the character quite competently. Samuel L. Jackson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Don Cheadle also return, but they don't do more than they did in the previous film, still fulfilling what was asked of them. Scarlett Johansson deserves a praise for her work here, but the rest of the cast just do what needs to be done.The film is yet another very expensive blockbuster, abundantly financed by Marvel, and it is very obvious that it will become one of the most watched films of the season. With so much money and financial interest involved, the film was doomed to a loud and flashy bet on high-quality, but still obviously false, effects and CGI. The film has a lot of action and the fights are excellent, although obviously choreographed and stilted. The cinematography is crisp, vibrant, and magnificently beautiful. The film bets a lot on quality props, good sets and costumes, as well as a good soundtrack.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as the first one,"The action scenes were fantastic. The acting was good as always in the MCU, Don Cheadle and RDJ are amazing of course. Black Widow's introduction is great, posing as someone showing her hidden background. This film isn't bad, and definitely not the worst of the MCU, it's just not as good as some others. The problem with this film and some others, is that the villains are terrible, some people don't even remember them, of course I do because I just love marvel but still, the villain's story really isn't that good, and with Whiplash being a character introduced through the movie, not even die hard marvel fans knew about him at first, they knew about his father, but not him. Overall the film isn't bad, just one of the worst of a great franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Complex but FUN..... Believe The Hype, GREAT film.","Iron Man 2 delivers action with great emotional moments and a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated. It hits a high standard of excellence by combining humor, a complex plot, breathtaking action sequences, a heavy dose of self discovery and realization, betrayal, forgiveness, love and puts it all together in one amazing package. All too infrequently, a much hyped blockbuster hits the mark with such power that it resonates above all others. Iron Man 2 is such a movie. Much like the first film, it's truly deep and complex but sacrifices none of the fun. The inner turmoil worked well, the beautiful thing is that we can relate to each character, especially that of Tony Stark. Stark's indomitable charm mixed with his flawed character makes this hero more interesting then most. Mark my words; Iron Man 2 is a movie people will be talking about all year if not for years to come. Iron Man 2 delivers action with great emotional moments and a movie that lives up to all the hype it has generated.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as the first.,Like most sequels Iron Man 2 fails to live up to the lofty high standards set by Iron Man (2008). That being said Iron Man two does some nice world building for future MCU films introducing War Machine and Black Widow and also getting a better look at Shield and Nick Fury. This sequel often gets hated on and there is a reason for that with the plot genuinely being decent the execution of this does not pay off. The stakes do not seem as high as they were in the original and what seems like a big enough story is actually quite small scale.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 2,Iron Man 2 is a decent follow up to the first. The cast is great again and there are some fun action scenes. The race scene and the final fight are quite good.

We get an introduction to Black Widow in this which is great.

Suffering from sequalnitis,"SYNOPSIS:
The word is out, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is Iron Man and everyone wants a piece of the technology. Unfortunately, Stark isn't the only one capable of building a suit and the others who can, aren't who you want replicating it.REVIEW:
The thing with MCU films is there are always redeemable factors (possibly other than Dark World I've been trying to avoid that for years). The first 30 minutes of this film I love. After that, it starts to go downhill a bit. It doesn't completely go off the rails, but it starts to focus far more on the health of Stark and how the piece in his chest is killing him. Now, I wasn't hating the movie during the middle, but especially when compared to the first film, there was a lot less going on and it didn't keep the same pace that the other films do and to me, it didn't have a good final battle. I honestly felt that Stark had more trouble on the race course (which is one of the best scenes in the MCU) than he had at the end. Granted he had help, but it also ended very soon and there didn't seem to be any real threat to his life displayed in the film. There was more of a threat coming from his chest throughout the film. I know it wasn't the fault of the studio and I like Don Cheadle, but I feel Terrence Howard was a better Rhodey and was more believable in that part. The film wasn't terrible, but wasn't one of the best. I still did enjoy aspects, such as the direction from Favreau, the addition of Agent Romanov (Scarlett Johansson) and I loved Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko, but I will find myself revisiting the other films far more than this one. 6.5/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Pretty good sequel that's entertaining, explosive and sexy.","""Iron Man"" is not my favorite superhero(that place goes to Batman)nor does he rank ahead of Wonder Women still Tony Stark is an interesting cocky sucker of enough character to watch. As ""Iron Man 2"" for a sequel really delivered. As director Jon Favreau once again kept the action rolling with special effects and kick ass action sequences. Once again Robert Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark former weapons mogul turned special agent Iron Man. This time his challenge is a Russian villain named Ivan(Mickey Rourke fresh off his classic performance in ""The Wrestler"") who wants to destroy the world with his new chemical and high tech weapons. And Sam Rockwell struts as a money hungry arms dealer.Returning is Gwyneth Paltrow as Tony's girlfriend now company CEO. And to spice up the picture a real treat of eye candy is Scarlett Johansson as Natasha who's sexy as hell! She becomes a new superhero! Really this film is a showcase for cutting edge technology that shows human inventions. And it was nice to see a cameo by Bill O' Reilly too.

"Robert Downey Jr., you did it again!!","I gotta say, Robert Downey Jr. is the best actor I've ever seen! He beats out greats like Johnny Depp and Brad Pitt. He never ceases to impress and woo. Every movie he is in, he always steals the spotlight. Robert is perfect in any role he plays. He has got to be the most charismatic guy on the planet. AND the best looking! Yes, his handsomeness is on great display in this amazing film!Now, getting to Iron Man 2, it triples the magic of the first one! The script (and some hilarious obvious ad-libs by Robert Downey Jr.), the plot, the acting, the casting, the chemistry amongst the actors, the directing, the effects, the sets, the messages- PERFECT. PLUPERFECT.The comedy, the drama, the action, the themes, the FUN! My oh my, this movie was something a sequel never is- better than the first! First off, I LOVED the first Iron Man- absolutely adored the film. I had high expectations for Iron Man 2, but I thought it would be impossible to make the sequel any better than the fantastic start to a franchise was. But, I was wrong! Iron Man 2 is 10 times better than the first, if that's even possible! Honestly, I think everyone in the world should see this movie. I'm a big movie buff, and I say this only about the films I truly love. The plot was more complex this time with more subplots to add to the fantastic story. This is nothing like your regular superhero movie. This isn't Batman, Spiderman, or Superman. This is as realistic as it gets. This is something that could truly happen in real life, especially nowadays. It very much applies to modern times and modern problems. This is a very realistic man dealing with very realistic problems. By the way, Tony Stark wasn't that narcissistic at all, even though many people seem to say he was. RDJ portrayed him as truly likable with real emotion, charm, and on-the-dot comic timing. A real-world hero. Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark will go down in history as one of the big screen's most memorable characters.This movie kept the audience laughing throughout with the superb witty dialogue and many intentionally hilarious scenes laced with intelligent humor. The movie had some truly emotional and serious scenes, courtesy of the great talent of Robert Downey Jr. It is art. It is pure charm on display for all to see. It is a gift. It is true talent and ability to sway the emotions of the viewers. Robert is my hero- in more ways than one. As a woman, I am so happy a man so ideal actually exists! Is he peerless? Quite possibly!The serious undertones of this action-packed intelligent comedy give the movie its edge. The fact that this movie very much applies to the real world is very appealing.The Avengers is next, but that will contain the unrealistic superheroes like Thor and Hulk, which belong with Spiderman and Superman...that won't be the same...the Iron Man franchise is the real superhero franchise- not a kids' make-believe one. Iron Man 1 and 2 have such great charm and that real-world quality that are not present in the Batman franchises, the Spiderman franchise, the Superman franchise, the Hulk movies, and all the other superhero films. Iron Man 2 is unmatched in its strength as true coolness and top-notch entertainment. It is so smartly written and performed that it makes me truly proud of Hollywood. Thanks to RDJ and Jon Favreau!I am more than pleased with Iron Man 2. I am beyond blown away. It's worth every penny to go and see it! I'm going to see it for a third time next weekend!This film is eye-candy, brain-candy, and heart-candy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"A small step down, but a great sequel","Iron Man 2 is definitely one of the most underrated sequels of the MCU. Robert Downey Jr returns once again as Tony Stark/Iron Man after revealing to the world that he is Iron Man, Tony must face new challenges such as the government thinking his suit is a dangerous weapon and wanting him to hand it over, finding a new replacement for the palladium core in his arc reactor that's keeping him alive while also poisoning him, and fighting a new enemy that ties into his family's legacy. Mickey Rourke stars as the villain Ivan Vanko/Whipflash and I highly think his villain definitely doesn't get the credit he deserves. The only problem I really have with his villain is the accent doesn't always hit its mark and he only has a couple of scenes of actual action that doesn't last long at all. Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts too as the new CEO of Stark Industries. Don Cheadle replaces Terrance Howard as Rhodey and now I can't imagine anybody, other than Don Cheadle portraying the character. The film also gives us a proper introduction to Samuel L Jackson's Nick Fury who is the the Director of Shield and Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Overall, Iron Man 2 isn't as great as it's predecessor, but it is a more than solid sequel that gives us plenty to be entertained by. Rating 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"""It's Good To Be Back""","And indeed it is. The first Iron Man came like lighting from a clear blue sky, a movie that started Robert Downey Jr's career, movie loved by audience and critics. Now there is a sequel and people are asking if it's worth it. And I say Hell Yeah.Now when the whole world knows who Iron Man is, Tony is having a hard time staying alive. There are two men coming after him, a Russian Ivan Vanko who has an unfinished business with Tony. He claims that he stole the idea for the arc reactor from his father (which of course isn't entirely true, he is a Russian, you can't believe those.) The second guy after him is actually a competitor in business, Justin Hammer, who, for years is trying to build a suit like Iron Man's but with horrible results. Now with the government wanting Tony's Iron Man suit and Stark Industries closed for business, he has a chance to become the leading weapons industry.The acting and the cast here are truly remarkable. Robert Downey Jr. is, well he is Robert Downey Jr. He is perfect as usual, you can't miss with him being cast in your movie. Gwyneth Paltrow does a great job being the love interest. Mickey Rourke doesn't have much time on screen but when he is you can see he enjoys the role and still tries to establish the character even with such limited screen time. Sam Rockwell is the comical villain and he is great at it. Samuel L. Jackson is a synonym of the word cool and he proves it once again as Nick Fury. He briefly appears but when he does he's got one of the best lines in the movie such as ""Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to exit the donut."" or "" I am very real. I'm the realest person you're ever gonna meet"". The weakest link in the chain is Don Cheadle. He horribly doesn't fit as James Rhodes. He is uninteresting, and he acts too serious for this role. This is supposed to be entertaining, fun movie. And when he has no idea what to do, he copies Terrence Howard's take on this character. His character changed from the best friend ever to the worst friend. He became arrogant too. He actually thinks he is better than Iron Man!! But that of course isn't true. As always there is a great little cameo by Stan Lee. I can't forget all the rush on the internet Olivia Munn being a superhero and then she had just a tiny cameo as a news reporter. I was chuckling in the theater and no one had idea why.Casting Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was the smartest idea anyone ever had. She is the sexiest woman on Earth and seeing her in a tight leather suit is worth all the money on Earth. Her only fight scene in the hallway with like a dozen guards is amazing. It is one of the best choreographed fights of this year. It is just purely awesome, sexy, full of adrenaline and even funny.I just feel like all those composers started to try again after last year's (almost) fiasco. OK, there were few exceptions, the Star Trek soundtrack, Up soundtrack and the Sherlock Holmes soundtrack. In this year there is more than just three great soundtracks and Iron Man 2 is one of them. The score is darker and more bad-ass. Three tracks that really stand out: the first track (Ivan's Metamorphosis), Monaco Drive with this heavy James Bond feel and the track titled Black Widow Kicks Ass. Soundtrack as such features songs from AC/DC, Queen and even Daft Punk.There are more action scenes in this one than in the first movie. The action scenes are much better, they are fast paced, bad ass, simply better. There is even one car chase scene.In summary, if you liked the first then I guarantee you that you will enjoy this one too, it's a must-see for any fan of Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Iron Man or a comic-books. (There are tons of comic-book references including the Avengers, Hulk and it's just great fun looking for them.) This is a great, entertaining summer movie so go and watch it.Definitely wait until the end of the credits there is a great extra scene and you find out what agent Coulson was doing in New Mexico.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 2 be Continued...,"The second instalment of iron man turned out to be...let's say average! Whilst Mr Downey Jr and Mickey Rourke maintain a good level of acting, the storyline somewhat blues the essence of what Iron man is truly about...Firstly, everything cool about iron man stays relatively unique. The hot rod red and gold colours maintain his glamour, but the production of other suits means that Iron man doesn't seem as special now. Secondly, 'hammer industries' really loses the fear factor when Hammer himself is portrayed so badly by Sam Rockwell. Not so much a villain as a comedian, which is not what the doctor ordered.I'm intrigued by the marvel series after watching this, with Natalie rushman clearly the aesthetically pleasing type and the introduction of the second coolest man on the planet (Samuel L Jackson), the story is beginning to piece together.. but compared to the first movie in the iron man series, this was a little below the bar setJ Boss reviews gives 7.0/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

We knew Jon Favreau was good when we saw 'Elf'. He just keeps on getting better. This is phenomenal. I am afraid this movie is not for 'artsy' type. Girls and refined folks! Advice for y'all! Keep away. This ain't your scene! This is a plain and simple hardcore action movie with a great story and even greater action. Mind blowing action! Both the movies have great scripts. Favreau is lucky with that one. And awesome actors playing them. I am not gonna give away the story. I recommend you see for yourself.If ever there was a 'Phoenix' in Hollywood, its Robert Downey Jr. A decade ago he was convicted and imprisoned. The only thing going for him was Ally Macbeal. Hollywood had written him off. Now he's headlining two big franchises. Tony Stark and Sherlock Holmes. Speaks volumes about his quality. He rose from his ashes.

Good film,"Good film, but tiring of the Marvel characters - did not see Avengers. Many interesting side characters make an appearance this time around. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) plays more of a prominent role as the leader of S. H. I. E. L. D. Scarlett Johansson has great screen presence as Natalie Rushman (aka. Black Widow)-she holds herself pretty well in a great martial arts scene. Don Cheadle has replaced Terrance Howard as Lt. Col. ""Rhodey"" and gets to play a more prominent role as an Iron Man suit-armored partner to Tony. This film, unlike the first film, tends to lean towards the idea of teamwork more. (Perhaps they're just prepping us for an Avenger film?) Mickie Rourke is engaging on screen as the Russian physicist villain Ivan, which he plays with dark relish. Although his technology-glowing, electrically charged whips-isn't anything new, he is always fun to watch. Likewise, Sam Rockwell is great as usual as a villain, the wisecracking Justin Hammer.At the very least it's mildly entertaining and I like Robert Downey, Jr and his support of Make A Wish - it's the only reason I watched this.The plot simply continues on from the last film, after people have found out the true identity of Iron Man. While it's nothing too complex, the progression of the story is logical--it would surely bring some enemies out of the woodwork if they knew who he was. The film's pacing isn't as zippy as the first film, where something always seems to be happening, and some audiences may be disappointed as a result.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 2 = Double Awesomeness!!,"Before Iron Man was made John Favreau said he can never imagine anyone except Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man and as we know RDJ's career went to a totally different level after that movie... Iron Man 2 promises the same..Not many think that this movie could achieve the status the previous one achieved but mark my words, it will provide double entertainment as the previous one.. Sure its ending is also not up to the mark as the previous one but Robert Downey is the star his action sequences, his comic timing and his one liners are so brilliant that u might tempt to give an Oscar to him right away!Mickey Rourke as Whiplash is superb as ever! He is mean, he is strong, he is dangerous.. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow is sexy and perfect, although many may complaint about not being given the full description about her character when she is introduced in the film.. Don Cheadle beats Terence Howard as John Rhodes in this movie.. But the real surprise came in the form of Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer.. His performance was a delight! Gwyneth Paltrow was same as the previous one..To conclude this movie promises to deliver double awesomeness in form of action, humor, special effects and everything.. Don't Miss this one!!My Rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"It's not terrible, but it's far from great.","Iron Man 2 feels like a significant downgrade compared to the first film. Where the original had an exceptional balance of story, emotion, and action, this sequel struggles to find the same equilibrium. That's not to say it's all bad-it does have some strong positives, such as expanding the MCU and diving deeper into Tony Stark's emotional and psychological struggles. On paper, these ideas sound fantastic, but in execution, the movie falters.A major issue is the pacing. At times, the movie feels downright tedious. It seems like they tried to replicate some of the magic from the first film, but the combination of certain camera takes, an excess of dull dialogue, and a lack of action makes it fall flat. When there is action, it doesn't feel impactful enough to justify the slow build-up.The conflict with the government and the consequences of Tony Stark's bold reveal of his identity in the first movie had a lot of potential but were underutilized. These elements could have been explored in a much more engaging and meaningful way, adding tension and depth to the plot. Instead, they end up feeling like missed opportunities.That being said, it's not a complete failure. There are moments of charm, and the development of the larger MCU framework is an essential stepping stone for future films. Still, the movie leans too heavily on ideas that worked in the original, without delivering the same energy or payoff.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Best movie of 2010,"The people giving this a ratting lower then 10 must have not watched the same movie.Sure at times Stark is not Kicking butt But every movie needs time for background stores etc etc, At no point did i find myself saying ""this movie is boring or getting slow"" It was 100% the best movie from Start to end.If you really want to see this movie then see it at the IMAX, Well worth it, And make sure you stay after the credits =) you'll be happy you did.I give this a 12/10 or even more, it really was the best movie of 2010.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Stark with a spark,"With (Robert Downey Jr.) Starks alter ego Iron Man's status well and truly established on the world, a new terror is rising in Ivan Vanko. (Mickey Rourke) plays the cold hearted Vanko, distant, undisturbed and focused on nothing but his mission. The mission to avenge his father and pay a dept he believes the Stark family owe. Much like the first movie the light hearted charm remains in Stark and (Gyyneth Paltrow) Pepper Potts flirtatious encounters. Yet this time newcomer Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) is added to the recipe stretching the reflexes whilst bringing new dimensions to the newly formed love triangle. Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) with what appears to be a cameo unveils her as a member of the shield, yet his presence once again is highly welcome, rarely is there a dull moment when big Sam is on screen.Iron Man 2 is a rollercoaster of a ride. Stark is unwilling to give up his technology and weapons now the world knows he is Iron Man and he is arrogant in his beliefs that the rest of the world is nowhere near in designing a battle suit close to his. Much like the first film expert research must have been made, Robert Downey Jr is the personification of Stark and Iron Man once again. Each character has been perfectly cast for this movie. Mickey Rourke is excellent as the Russian hell bent on revenge a vendetta that goes back to his father being exiled from stark industries. (Don Cheadle) is now playing Rhodes and although I prefer (Terrace Howard) in this role, Don Cheadle is worthy of the part as war machine the trusty sidekick of Iron man, although Don provides more of a comedic tone than I felt Terrace Howard brought. Reluctant to delve into the secrets of his technology Stark is boastful and makes more enemies in fellow business man Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) the antagonist. Sam Rockwell brings a more thrilling opposition than Rourke much like (Jeff Bridges) brought prior to this in the first movie, not so much crazy more jealous of the success of Tony Stark type of guy. The film is similar to the first and doesn't really bring nothing new to the table, however I'd say Rourke has more screen time than Jeff Bridges had in the first film which allowed him to stand out.The effects and locations make for an all round well thought out movie and although the story has no real twist it has enough to keep viewers watching. Jon Favreau brings a much faster paced movie this time around, still, it often is as entertaining and gripping as the first time around. The threat to our protagonist gets bigger and the effect up the ante where the stakes become higher. The biggest downfall for Iron man and Tony Stark in this particular one is whether he can indeed be trust with his own devices. Where the cliffhanger of the original left off with Stark annoying himself as Iron Man to the world, actually leaves the highest level of hostility.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Bland,"Iron Man 2 is the Third film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the second film in the Iron Man Franchise, and sadly its not one of those sequels that surpasses the original. While not terrible, Robert Downey Jr. is still as charismatic as ever and we get some great character introductions from Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson, with Don Cheadle replacing Terrance Howard. (which in my opinion was a great replacement) The Story does focus more on The character of Tony Stark, which isn't bad but it's a lot of story and story with little pay off. The action in the end is great, the acting is on par, and Favreau is one of my favorite directors, but the film is just okay. I expected more, but I didn't get anything less.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing to say the least,"Do you remember how you felt right after having watched 'The Empire Strikes Back'? 'The Return of the Jedi'? 'The Matrix'? Or the first Iron Man movie?If you are like me, I would guess pretty darn excited -- 'Can't wait to see what happens next'! Now try to remember how you felt after watching 'The Phantom Menace' and 'The Matrix Reloaded' --Well, after watching two of the biggest travesties in the world of sequels... I felt completely frustrated, angry and cheated!I won't say I feel the same resentment after having watched Iron Man 2 but it comes pretty darn close.Iron Man 1? A fantastic movie! Iron Man 2? I want my money back! And my travel expenses!What is wrong with Iron Man 2? Do you have a couple of hours?Maybe...no script? Really, are these guys serious? They make a movie costing around $150 million dollars and the script SUCKS BIG TIME.Plot holes anyone? There is NO motivation: you have no idea why you should care about the characters, since the characters themselves don't have a clue what they are supposed to do or feel and why in this story. I'm not saying the actors are bad, they are doing all they can, but they are given a crappy script to work with.No sense of suspense or danger: despite one hundred of explosions and a couple of thousand stray bullets in crowded areas, NOT ONE PERSON gets killed or wounded in the whole movie! The closest you get to 'wounded' are a couple of bruises. How am I supposed to care for someone when I KNOW he won't get hurt? This is a MAJOR difference from the first Iron Man movie, where the threat was real.Somebody desperately tried to make Iron Man 2 into a movie for all ages -- well, it worked, in the worst possible way.This is also why all of the action scenes are boring, since all you see is CGI animated cartoon robots bashing into each other -- sounds a lot like Transformers you say? That's right, but with EVEN LESS human emotion, since no one gets hurt.It was pretty difficult to mess this up, but they somehow managed to do it.I've read all the rave reviews -- ""action packed!"", ""entertaining!"" ""terrific!"" Are we talking about the same movie here? Seriously guys, either you have a very low standard or you have never watched a movie that truly deserves those rave reviews, like: The Matrix and the original Star Wars trilogy.And no, I'm not comparing Iron Man 2 only to 'classic movies'. Even newer movies like Star Trek or Kick-Ass or even Iron Man 1 were ten times better!Kick-Ass was made for $30 million, instead of $150 like Iron Man 2 and it completely kicks Iron Man 2's ass in every department.I want to erase Iron Man 2 from my memory but I'm afraid it will be very difficult -- still having nightmares about Jar Jar Bings --Thank you Iron Man 2 screenwriters, for ruining the Iron Man 1 experience for me. I wish I could sue you.Why I still give it 5 stars? Because the actors tried. And because I smiled a few times. That's it. A DVD throwaway movie at most, it really wasn't worth my money.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
not bad,"Iron Man 2 is a solid sequel, earning a 7/10 for its entertaining yet imperfect delivery. Robert Downey Jr. Continues to impress as Tony Stark, bringing charisma and wit to the role, but the film's multiple subplots dilute the story's focus. The introduction of new characters like Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) adds excitement, though some, like Whiplash (Mickey Rourke), feel underutilized. The cinematography and special effects are top-notch, delivering visually stunning action sequences. However, while the soundtrack complements the film's energy, it doesn't stand out as particularly memorable. Overall, it's a fun ride but lacks the impact of its predecessor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A drop in the series but an important one,"Iron Man 2 follows the events of the first Iron Man and takes a turn to change the series into what we know now as the MCU. With many cast members coming back for the sequel we are introduced to a lot of new and fun faces to the series as well. With the introduction to many new beloved characters many fans have fell in love with with every installment added to the Marvel series.Story wise with Iron Man 2 has dropped slightly since the first, feeling more like a bridging movie to set up other movies and the future Avengers movie that came out two years after Iron Man 2. With the introduction of many now beloved faces including Black Widow, War Machine, and the Iconic Nick Fury with Agent Phil Coulson too. This film though did give us a more of an understanding with the arc reactor in Tony's chest and the overall negative aspects of him using it and the Iron Man suit too. Alongside with giving us a darker side of Tony's father, Howard Stark and the more darker stuff he did before his mysterious death 1991.Jon Favreau once again directs the hell out of this film. Feeling more updated and bigger than the fantastic first film. With the use of long uncut takes in many beautiful scenes and action packed ones as well. And with Favreau acting in the film with a much bigger part than the first film, he made himself serve very much as the comic relief in some very action packed scenes and very serious scenes as well. That was the one thing with this film is that it felt much more comical than the first film, which had splashes of comedy put throughout mainly done by Tony Stark himself in very awkward scenes to write them off a lot better. Iron Man 2 though, Many characters just come off as comedians like Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer is just all around comical and is suppose to serve as a driving force for the main antagonist but comes off as mainly a little prod that keeps poking the antagonist until he breaks out yelling.And that is where I come to the script, a hand full of the lines in this film feel very forced and rushed to either rapidly pass the story forward or to get off some supposedly funny joke that will sometimes come off as just awful and unfunny all around. But the other majority of lines and scenes in this film do have a lot of power to them like the interrogation scene between Tony and Ivan and the phone call too later in the film. Very powerful and gives an almost 'cat and mouse' feel to the film on who will outsmart the other in this race to kill one another. And of course the writing for Black Widow was amazing with the different dialogue and tones she has to do for the different personalities she had to pull off in this film to be that 'agent' status throughout.Action and special effects wise definitely grew a lot more since the first film with many more action scenes and drastically improvement on the CGI work and fight choreographing too to it. Feels a lot more natural during the whole film, thanks to Favreau and his brilliant directing too with it.Iron Man 2 is definitely a let down to the near perfect first film but it definitely is a fun one to watch with its unique characters and bigger and badder fights.Iron Man 2 gets a 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Incredible sequel and good set-up for ""Demon in a Bottle""","I really don't understand what people were expecting, looking at some of the negative reviews. This sequel gives you everything that was great about the first film and then some. Better action, more humor, more characters, and more Easter eggs leading into the Avengers movie. It delves further into Tony Stark's character, showing that his arrogant public persona is a ruse...behind the scenes, he's scared to death because the artificial heart he created is slowly poisoning him to death. He begins drinking heavily, which is leading up to a ""Demon in a Bottle"" sequel; comic book fans know that I'm talking about a key Iron Man story line that helped define the character. I loved Scarlett Johansen as the Black Widow...her one action scene was awesome. The two major Iron Man/War Machine fight scenes beat the action sequences in the first film. The final scene was much better the first movie's finale. I can't wait to see Captain America, Thor, and the Avengers movies!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

There wasn't that much new change or difference in 2 that we didn't catch on 1 except for that there were so many ROBOTS.The conclusion is, Iron man 2 is not one of those movies that will be immortal in your mind, it's not one of those movies that will remain on the talk between people forever, It's just a perfect movie for entertaining that will make you enjoy every second of it, It's a must popcorn movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A sequel that doesn't bet on ""twice the action"" formula.","This is one of the very few blockbuster franchises that I have followed so far. I usually see them fast, or I don't see them at all. And following the Iron Man franchise has ""payed off"", so far. But this part is different and does feel different than the first, and for some reason it's not so easy to immediately answer why exactly.The first thing that came to mind is that despite the bigger budget of the second part, the ""level"" and the time of action is the same if not shorter than in ""Iron Man 1"". I never thought that I will ever caught myself thinking that there should be more action and less talking in a so-called ""summer film"".The real substitute for all the chasing, shooting and blowing up that is a bit missing in this film, is an array of new characters. The constant talking of everyone, especially Tony Stark of course, gives the film a dynamic pace and probably makes those 2 hours go by much quicker. But from my view, the most silent character of all, Vanko, was the most interesting one.What is also specific for the Iron Man franchise and many of this kind of big films of the new millennium, is the skillful adding of ""counter-culture"" elements in a very mainstream product. This part left me down here quite a bit. The first trailer for the film had me thinking and hoping that we'll see some kind of a critique of war-profiteering and that it will all lead us to a path of at least some moral dilemmas. But sadly, all of Vanko's motives for vengeance are reduced to some old family rivalry. I guess it is (still?) too much to ask for more from a king-size summer opening film like this.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A rousing follow-up that very nearly matches the brilliant first instalment.,"Sequels are the most difficult movies to get right. Fickle audiences are anticipating more of what they loved in the first flick, but don't want it to become repetitive. On the flipside they also expect it to be fresh and innovative without it feeling like an altogether dissimilar movie from the original. Trying to find that balance is an extremely tricky thing and most don't succeed. Where does IM2 fit in? It's not in the higher echelon of action sequels alongside The Dark Knight or X2, which bettered their predecessors, but it's definitely not far off and that's no easy feat.Justin Theroux's screenplay is crammed with a plethora of plot strands and for the most part – minus a partially neglected Tony / Pepper subplot here and a wasted opportunity with Vanko there – he manages to juggle them quite effectively. The biting social commentary from the initial film is back in addition to the trademark casual humour not seen in other comic book adaptations, however Theroux has expanded the Iron Man franchise with a slightly more light-hearted approach, undoubtedly due to the burgeoning Marvel movie-universe that is currently being formed. Subsequently there's a much stronger focus on the collective Marvel effort to come in the future, thanks to a larger part for Nick Fury (Jackson) and a couple of teasing moments (make sure you stay until the end of the credits) that hint at other characters looming nearby.Returning in the director's seat is the ever-surprising Jon Favreau, once again helming with confidence and flair. His handle on the action set-pieces increasingly gets better, despite a vaguely underwhelming climactic showdown, with the clash at Monaco's F1 Grand Prix and ruckus at Tony's Malibu mansion the highlights. The special effects team greatly aid Favreau as the CGI is practically faultless; the diverse machinery on show is photo-realistic ensuring the fight and flight sequences look amazing. Sans computer effects, a lithe Johansson rumbling with a handful of Hammer's henchmen will have you in awe, not just because of the outfit worn by Johansson but due to the excellent fight choreography and the fact that most of the stunts were performed by the actress herself.Portraying our uniquely cavalier protagonist, Downey Jr exudes charisma and style yet again. His cocky, eccentric exterior becomes a tad monotonous but never reaches a level that decreases his likability. Unexpectedly the cast member that challenges Downey Jr to best on screen is the equally peculiar and compelling Sam Rockwell. He makes what could have been a smarmy, one-dimensional villain into a humorous and engaging tyrant who even manages to outdo Tony in the comedy stakes. Elsewhere Rourke makes for a suitable tattooed Ruskie, Paltrow and Johannson offer sweet and sexy respectively and Cheadle fills the boots left by Terrence Howard gratifyingly. Kudos to Cheadle and the filmmakers for making the 'new' Rhodey's entrance a memorably quick-witted in-joke too; they swiftly dispel the audiences concern of having a different actor in the role.A rousing follow-up that very nearly matches the brilliant first instalment and will leave you keen for more Iron Man, whether in his own movie or not.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Loved This Movie,"I don't normally write reviews, but I had to after seeing some of the Critic reviews. I am a huge, huge comic book fan. Have been since I was 7. Iron Man caught me off guard. I was always loved the 'Avengers' (Marvel comics always beat DC in my world), but Iron Man was never one of my favourite characters, but the first movie was right up there with Batman Begins, Spiderman 2, and X-Men 2.For me Iron Man 2 is in that league.

A fair sequel...,"I very much enjoyed the first film in this series and was hoping for more of the same in the sequel. Fortunately I wasn't too disappointed, it lived up to the first one, maybe not quite as good (sequels seldom are), but a fine effort nonetheless. The setting is New York where Tony Stark, having revealed himself as Iron Man and having brought peace to the world, is holding his Stark Expo, an exhibition of technology from all over the world. An idea originated by his father, Howard.In Russia, Ivan Vanko, brooding after the death of his father, Anton, who had worked with Howard Stark on the early prototype of the power source that now drives Iron Man's suit. He was extradited back to Russia for espionage and made to live in Siberia. Ivan, now seeking revenge works on a suit of his own. Meanwhile back in the USA, Tony Stark has been summoned before a Senate committee who are determined to get him to give them the Iron Man suit for military use. One of the experts called to the hearing is Justin Hammer, one of Stark's former competitors when he made weapons for a living. Bringing his friend, Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes to testify backfires on the committee and Stark wins the day, but things are not over between him and Hammer.Stark now decides to hand control of Stark Industries over to Pepper Potts having discovered his health is at risk from wearing the suit. The papers are drawn up and a woman from the legal department, Natalie Rushman, brings them for signing. She impresses Stark and later becomes Pepper's assistant. Heading to Monaco, Stark decides to compete in a motor race. He is surprised when Ivan Vanko turns up and destroys his car with plasma whips. Fortunately, Pepper is there with his Iron Man suit and he manages to subdue the Russian. Vanko goes to jail but is later sprung by someone who is very interested in his work.Returning home, Stark prepares for his birthday party, but with many things praying on his mind he gets drunk wearing the suit and ends up in a fight with Rhodey. Enter Nick Fury who helps put Stark back on the road to recovery and reveal that someone close to him is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent. Hammer is due to show the work he has been doing at Stark's Expo and he has a few things he wants to surprise him with. Things are brewing up for a big fight at the end, but I don't want to spoil it for you, I'll just say it's pretty spectacular and Vanko isn't finished with Stark just yet.This is a very well made film with plenty of very well designed and executed special effects. The score is great, but if you put AC/DC, The Clash and Queen in there you're always going to get my vote! The performances were all good, special mentions go to Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark, Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer and Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko. Honourable mentions go to Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts, Don Cheadle as Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes, Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury.I must admit I didn't much care for the character of Tony Stark at first, he is egotistic and narcissistic. As the film went on he did show he does have a human side though. Justin Hammer is equally egotistic which I found made for an interesting dynamic to this good versus evil story. I also had a problem with America being the centre of everything, yet again, it's like the rest of the world doesn't exist! (Apart from Monaco). Although I did find it amusing when Stark is standing in front of a giant US flag projected on a screen with an Australian/British rock band providing the music. But enough of these minor niggles, the film is great fun, not as good as the first one, but as sequels go, it's certainly watchable. Over all, recommended.My score: 7.2/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Takes the comic book genre to the highest level,"I love this quote by Robert Downey Jr.: ""I can honestly say that Tony Stark is the coolest character I've ever played. If I look at anything, it's the mythology that has grown up around him and how I can use that to raise this movie to a really high order of art."" Mission accomplished, Robert. IM1 took the comic book genre to the highest level and IM2 builds perfectly upon the first film. Downey and Favreau again deliver a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. In fact, the action is taken to the next level while sacrificing none of the complexity or heart that made the first film a pure classic. I totally agree with most of the film critics who are praising Iron Man 2.Iron Man 2 does indeed do the near impossible and that's improve on the first film. It really is as fabulous as you've heard and as good as everyone is saying. The entire cast, the crew, the FX people and writers should all be as proud of this exceptional movie as they were of the first film. Nice job!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Better than Part One !!!,"I hated Iron Man I. Really, I hated it. I was disappointed with the plot, shallow characterization, wrong translation of Hindi etc. And after last year's piece of crap that was Transformers 2, I didn't expect this sequel to deliver because the trailers, the teasers or the plot didn't convince me. So, I go in the empty theater and seat myself in the second row. In twenty minutes, I've finished my popcorn and the crowd finally shows up. The theater's full. The movie starts rolling and Iron Man enters the scene and warmly greets the audience by a ""It's good to be back"" remark. The rest of it is pure awesomeness. Well, I'll summarize the whole experience in two sections for ur convenience:The Good : 1. Acting. The cast fits. RDJ is exceptional as Iron Man, Scarlett Johanson is perfect as Black Widow and Mickey Rourke excels as the formidable Ivan Vanko. 2. The story. Good story, very involving. 3. The action, obviously. 4. The special effects were awesome. 5. The humor. The humor was veryveryvery good. My stomach almost burst open during the last scene, which was Hilariously surprising.The bad: 1. Some actors don't fit their characters. I couldn't digest Don Cheadle as Rhodes after Terrence Howard's amazing performance as the same character in part one. Also, Samuel L. Jackson (whose appearance in this movie was a little more than a cameo) sounds more like Jules from Pulp Fiction than Nick Fury. 2. The last fight scene. You'll know why the last fight scene stinks, after you see the movie. 3. Bad character exploration. The appearance of characters like Happy Hogan, Black Widow and Nick Fury feel like a little more than cameos.All in all, a great movie.

I watched the first installment and the sequel both in the theater, and I must admit that I enjoyed this one much more than the first.

Better then I was expecting but not what I hoped for.,"First let me start out by saying that though this movie is good it won't be as good if you haven't seen the 1st movie.The viewers main complaints have been the lack of a solid plot (like transformer 2 except not as bad) and some of the plot holes. After catching an early screening of this movie I had mixed thoughts going in but largely came out generally satisfied. To me the trailers I saw didn't look very impressive and once they got rid of Terrence Howard it just bummed me out even more.The movie generally seemed to take itself less serious than the 1st movie, that irritated me. One of the things I loved so much about the first movie was how well they conveyed it so you didn't feel like it was another cheesy superhero movie. Iron man 2 definitely had some hints of that.On the actors front everything was generally solid besides a few accent slips here and there. The only thing that stuck out to me was the feeling of Don Cheadle being sort of the replacement man,, I honestly couldn't shake that feeling. The plot holes I mainly heard was ""why didn't Stark just fly over whiplash and blow his head off?"" I generally understand their points but without the dramatized fights the movie would just be boring! :p However, the climactic ending (iron man 1 lacked) and the awesome CGI coupled with cool fight scenes really make this movie go from zero to hero. I would say that this is like a Transformers 2 except without such a big letdown and not as bad.Overall: 7/10 or B",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
That's more like it!,"What makes this second part of the Iron Man live story better is that it sticks to the genuine comic books characters.

It was what i expected.,"While watching the first Iron Man, I was a little disappointed. The movie was entertaining to watch, but it did not have enough action, or Iron Man in it. It seemed like a ton of story telling, and not enough of what the genre it is under: action. So, with this in mind, it took my friends a lot of persuading to get me to go see the next Iron Man in theaters, but they did so, and boy do I regret it.First off, don't get me wrong, I thought the movie was OK and watchable, but I was not happy spending so much money on it when I could've just borrowed it from my brother when he bought it on DVD. Usually when I go to the movie theater, I want to watch a movie that would keep me entertained throughout the entire movie, and making me want to see it again. Iron Man had neither of these.When the theater employee up front was done talking about how people should turn their cell phones off and all that good stuff, people started cheering for the movie to start. I just sat there and waited patiently. As i was watching the movie, I was waiting for some sort of action to occur. When I finally got it, it was at a slower pace than I would've hoped, and it ended very quickly. I started realizing that this was happening the entire movie. It takes a long time for action to occur, and when it does, its length is low.Now, the movie has a lot of story telling as i was saying before. Importantly, there were way too many scenes and characters in the movie that you would not understand if you know nothing of Iron Man outside the movies. In other words, if you haven't read the comics, you would not know the names of some of the characters, or even how they were introduced. Thats right, they don't introduce some characters. For example Samuel L. Jackson's character. It just seemed he came into the film randomly.There is still some great parts to this movie. The dialog at times could be funny and entertaining, and just the overall special effects that Tony Stark has in his work area is a treat to the eye. The last action scene had a lot more length than the others, and definitely a nice little relief from the entire movie.Overall, this movie is a nice little film to watch if you don't care about the action scenes. If you're a big Iron Man fan, and read all the comics and such, then you would love this movie. If you are like me, the casual movie goer who is looking for a film that will be action packed and full of explosive fun, spend your money elsewhere.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An enjoyable banter-filled character driven super-hero film.,"A delightful banter heavy super-hero film in which the emphasis of the film is clearly put on the character of the film and less so on the super-heroic exploits and trials that comic-based films generally focus upon. The diminished focus on action pieces might threaten to bog the picture down but the character interactions and their barbed-filled vocal exchanges keep the film moving along at a clean pace until the inevitable CG heavy battle scenes.Not that there is a lack of money spent in terms of CG wizardry on the screen. But instead of merely focusing their efforts on the suit battles, the film is littered with highly detailed sets and the constant use of extremely high-tech holographic touch sensitive technology is all pervasive. Not to diminish the skirmishes involving the Iron Man suit though as they are fun to watch, very smoothly executed and very aesthetically pleasing especially Micky Rourke's frankensteined creation clashing with Tony Stark's ultra-slick technology.The plot itself treads no particular new ground although it does attempt to through in a great many sub-plots and personal dilemmas for the ample cast of characters to deal with. The problem with most of these dilemmas is that they generate very little serious drama as they are mainly dealt with in either a succinct manner or are treated in a rather glib fashion and things just sort of seem to work themselves out almost accidentally due to the increased amount of events and characters involved basically just diluting the situation to the point that it almost seems an afterthought when it is reconciled. This casual dismissive tone carries over to the antagonists as the film spreads itself out a little too thin to the point that what should have been powerful character conflicts involving the major characters just seem like minor scuffles.There is also the odd sort of underlying theme of a stereo-typical conservative American approach to the way in which the film idolizes weaponry and pushes the agenda that America possessing the most powerful weapon in the world would undoubtedly result in an increase in world peace. Then there's also the extra step the film takes that Americans apparently feel more comfortable in having a shallow, fun-loving, but seemingly trust worthy private individual in possession of the most powerful weapon in the world but not their own government.Is the writer trying to make a statement about the current mental state of American with the increase in paranoia and private militias or is it just more poorly thought out Hollywood worship of the Dirty Harry one man army character doing things we are afraid to take responsibility for? The film makes an attempt to explore the folly of this approach by the sudden attack of Ivan Vanko utilizing similar technology that supposedly was beyond the reach of the rest of the world as promised by Stark. This is then further compounded by a frustrated military friend being able to utilize one of the suits which seems improbable considering the vast amount of hack proof machinery that Stark regularly employs. But like with most issues in Iron Man these are just brushed aside or ignored in the face of an impending threat and we are left wondering what became of all that anyways? But despite all these faults I found the film infectiously enjoyable. Despite the fact that many characters aren't utilized to their fullest, they are immediately compelling and a joy to watch when they are on the screen. Micky Roarke is incredibly fun to watch as he is both a brutal thug and a introverted technology wizard who is only truly friendly to his father and his bird. Tony's relationship with his ambiguously defined girlfriend Pepper Potts is very engaging and their constant over-lapping dialogue exchanges were genuinely funny and wholly natural. Of course most of this has to do with Robert Downey Jr.'s great acting abilities and he really elevates the quality of the movie with his level of skill.Despite the intensely glib tone of the movie I found the whole thing very enjoyable. There's nothing new here to be sure, but the abilities of everyone involved elevate the movie as a whole into a very satisfying experience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Superb In Every Way!,"WOW! The director has crafted a super sequel that both dazzles the eyes and touches the heart. Much like Spider-Man 2, the truly remarkable special-effects of the new movie make it virtually impossible not to suspend one's disbelief. The effects actually beat Spider-Man 2. A lesser filmmaker would have been content to let the effects be the whole show, but Favreau gives us a movie populated by genuine characters and situations that make the film just as compelling in its quieter moments as it is during the big action scenes. IM2 combines the thrills of a big summer romp with the craftsmanship of a prestige studio picture. It's not simple popcorn fun although it certainly works in that capacity but it's as complex as its conflicted protagonist. It's a slickly engineered special-effects extravaganza with a saucy sense of humor that's well-acted and masterful at every turn. That's the kind of movie that I love to see one that isn't just dark to be dark or isn't just self-indulgent or overly serious for the sake of having some sort of false sense of gravitas. These Iron Man films are sweeping and even epic but, at the same time, they're tremendous popcorn entertainment. How many films can you say that about? Truly Superb.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
RDJ and Favreau keep this busy sequel an excellent and amusing thrill ride,"Superhero movie follow-ups have been a tough business lately. ""Iron Man 2"" marks Marvel's first sequel since ""Spider-Man 3"" left millions disappointed in 2007. So to quell any lingering fears, ""Iron Man 2"" is not a letdown. It's far from it. To think director Jon Favreau and star Robert Downey Jr. would lose sight of what they did that turned a lesser Marvel character into a multi-million-dollar franchise would be a gross underestimation.Downey Jr. does not relinquish Iron Man's reputation as the wittiest superhero ever brought to the big screen. ""Iron Man 2"" provides just as much of a humorous joyride as the 2008 film, backing up all the subtly outrageous dialogue with superb visual effects and action that seizes all attention. It all still works because Favreau has locked down the blend between not taking the story too seriously but still telling it with conviction.But oh yes, ""Iron Man 2"" complicates things a bit. Self-outted billionaire superhero Tony Stark aka Iron Man has a lot on his plate from government subpoenas asking him to hand his suit over to the people to a private matter: his fake heart -- the arc reactor -- is slowly poisoning him. Feeling like it all might cave in on him, Tony makes his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwenyth Paltrow), Stark Industries' new C.E.O.Screenwriter Justin Theroux (""Tropic Thunder"") accepts the responsibility of weaving these plot lines in with three new significant characters. Mickey Rourke assumes the villain role: silently vengeful Russian physicist Ivan Vanko, who after a failed attempt at using his own whip-toting arc-reactor suit to kill Tony in the film's first action sequence on a Monaco raceway, finds himself in the employ of Tony's arms-dealing nemesis, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). With Tony going in and out of the public's good graces, Hammer uses Vanko to create droid soldiers for the military, which would effectively make him the real ""American hero."" Scarlett Johansson goes redhead for a supporting role as one of Tony's new assistants who is more than she appears to be.The busyness continues because of Marvel's commitment to an eventual ""Avengers"" film in 2012 combining Iron Man and heroes of future Marvel films. Samuel L. Jackson appears as Nick Fury, director of S.H.I.E.L.D, looking to recruit Tony for his team and nudging him in the right direction as Tony's deceased father, Howard, holds the answer to his ""heart condition.""The overcrowding, however, never gets the best of ""Iron Man 2."" Theroux has designed the story to move along quickly and effectively, letting the action and the humor carry the entertainment factor evenly throughout the film. The unfortunate trade-off is that very little resonates about ""Iron Man 2."" Tony's attempt to find a new core element for his arc reactor is the one true through-line. Everything else from Tony's feuding with Pepper and his buddy Jim Rhodes (Cheadle) to Hammer's frustrations with Vanko's progress to Nick Fury all act in service of the plot. The element of Tony's irresponsibility and alcoholism, perhaps the greatest potential of the film to make any kind of statement, appears in only a couple brief scenes. Downey Jr. and Favreau give us many great Tony Stark moments, but he doesn't have a chance to grow -- just make us laugh and remember how great a character he is.And honestly, how great a character he is. Downey Jr.'s shtick hasn't gotten old in the least despite his increased exposure the last two years and the writing caters to him even more this time around. Maybe a lesser actor playing a lesser character wouldn't be able to lift up a busy superhero story with this many subplots, but RDJ has that ability. With an imaginative visual effects crew at his back and a director who knows how to condense action and make it count, he'll likely continue providing easy-to-love action entertainment as Iron Man no matter how many different chinks these films develop in their armor.-Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Disappointing sequel,"Naturally, after having seen Iron Man 1 and the fabulous Robert Downey Jr, seeing nr. 2 at the cinema was a nobrainer. But, while Spiderman and Batman produced the same cinematic level, Iron Man 2 does not. The cast is brilliant, the action scenes and gadgets are wonderful, but the plot fails completely. There is too little character development, too few surprises and, frankly, not enough big laughs either. The story could have done with more drama, like the first did, more ups and definitely more downs. RDJ's acting is over-the-top. Fun at times, but tiring at others. There are too many unfinished story lines, which suggests faulty cutting. Ms. Palthrow has had better appearances. Her character also could have done with more development. RDJ deserves better. And so do we! I'll keep my fingers crossed for nr. 3, but get some real writers in!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Really 'Avengers .5',"'Iron Man 2' has a reputation for being both not as good as the original and for being bogged down by set-up for 'The Avengers'. Both of these things are certainly true, but they're ultimately not tragic flaws.Though the villains and the stakes feel inconsequential, 'IM2' zips along at a fast clip, and fueled by great performances and a far more exciting and satisfying finale than its predecessor, it manages to entertain while also laying the foundation that the entire MCU is built upon.Flaws and all, 'Iron Man 2' is still a worthwhile entry into the MCU, and well worth revisiting for those who may not have liked it the first time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I think not,"The old saying goes that when people retire, they don't come back head strong. I disapprove very strongly whoever said that. When Iron Man come on the scene in 2008 as a remake of the original comic book, I said it wouldn't last. I was completely, out-of-my-freaking-mind, this movie rocked. I'm talking about Robert Downey, Jr. He may have had a rough beginning, but he has shown his true colors, especially the gold and the red colors. Now that they have added a third to make it a trilogy, I can't wait to see that one. I didn't think I would like Iron Man, but I do – here's what I think and believe about this, I think we are going to see Downey, Jr. more and more and more. Great acting, wonderful cast (Downey, Jr., Paltrow, Rourke, Cheadle, Rockwell, Johansson, Jackson) and a wonderful director who by the way made a cameo in the second. Let's give our props to Jon Faverau. Great movie, Great Job!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I am almost satisfied.,"For the record, I gave Iron Man 1 a solid 8.4, for all the calibers and brilliance it delivered. Now with Iron Man 2 I gave it 7.3. Here are my reasons.1, The comedy still plays out pretty good with Downey's performance well utilized. Though some of the jokes were not as genuine as the original. Jon Favreau's approach of mixing sci-fi action with comedy still works, that's maybe the best news for fans and non-fans alike. Fortunately, they didn't follow Transformers 2's formula ""bigger the better"" or we will see some serious disasters. We still have these jaws-dropping dynamic action sequences which are well controlled and edited. The F1 track one was definitely one of the best crafted sci-fi fighting scenes, almost with a nostalgic feeling attached to it(light saber becomes light whip?)The climax is as big as one can imagine, but there comes the shortcomings. The first Iron Man was so charming to me mainly because as the movie processes, audiences were sucked into Tony's mind of tech geek and crazy stuffs. The scenes with Tony testing all the parts of his design were pricelessly detailed and looked genuine, like you can touch this technology and really invite it into your kitchen someday. But Iron Man 2 was too busy telling a more complex story, giving up all the opportunities exploring more facets of a crazy inventor. So on so forth.2, Terrence Howard was a better Rhodes, delivering charms by himself or charmed the audiences by being the buddy/nanny for Tony. Don Cheadle feels so serious that he never gave this charming awkwardness as heartfelt as Howard. Beginning with him, I perceived several problems with the supporting characters. Having Scarlett Johnson kicking human asses is a smart move, but she doesn't feel entirely immersed with the Iron Man atmosphere (especially when she fought with security guards while Tony fights robots). The villains, however, are weak. Hammer is supposed to be a genuine idiot, with too much ego and too little brain to be in the pentagon. His ideas are never fit into the Iron Man technology, that's what the movie has successfully illustrated with the climax. With that in mind, one can expect any goofy acts from him. Sadly, he spent too much time on the screen and made him almost like pretending to be an idiot(not mainly due to Sam Rockwell's performance). On the opposite, audiences may find Mickey Rourke much more delicious to watch. He's a total bad-ass with an attitude. Beneath that, he's also a heartless technology maniac(typical villain from Russia). Except the 124 minutes of running time had mostly underused him, portraying him to be someone largely inferior to every aspects of Iron Man(overly obsessed with whip-type of weapons,keep making the same mistake,etc.) Somehow I was expecting him to be the key of saving Tony, but I was wrong because the makers can't wait to get Nick Fury back on screen, and made the story logically plausible but not structurally remarkable.My friend, who also loves movies, remarked that he didn't want to see Iron Man 2 because it's ""too predictable as they bring some bad-ass robot toe-to-toe with Tony Stark and Tony wins"". I told him that's not the point of any popcorn movies or superhero movies, but I guess he's not totally wrong with this one. Nevertheless, Iron Man 2 still boasts with masterful polishing and will most probably be nominated best special effects by Oscar.

Good but not great...,"I enjoyed this, don't get me wrong. It's a brilliant summer blockbuster, but there's just something off with it, and can't put my finger on what it is. Everything is there, a good balance of action, drama and humour. I'm racking my brains as to why I didn't enjoy it as much as Iron Man.I've came to the conclusion that's it just isn't memorable enough. It's as if they just made it for the sake of having a sequel. There's nothing that memorable about it at all. The pacing I feel is really uneven, there's only 2 main action scenes, and as good as they are, I just felt that they were just showing off the special effects. It just didn't have any substance.Robert Downey Jr is a brilliant actor, and I have to admit, there were scenes in Iron Man 2 where he really did make me laugh. The comedy was spot on, and it contained quite a lot of 'laugh out loud' moments. Anyway, the problem I have with Stark is that he doesn't feel like the same man from Iron Man. He comes across as arrogant, where as in the the first movie he was really smart. I wasn't too keen on the introduction of the Black Widow either, as much as I enjoyed watching Scarlett Johansson on a 60ft IMAX Screen.I left the cinema feeling flat, and disappointed. I'll wait for the DVD release and watch it again. But I wasn't that impressed today, sadly.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not  a great film to an original super action flick but not a bad film either!,"Iron Man 2 (2010) is not a great sequel to an original superhero Action films from 2008 portrayed on a comic books of Jon Favreau's Iron Man film from 2008. This film still delivers and is not that bad either. It is a good Action comic book superhero film but it is a lackluster sequel film. I am sorry Iron Man fans but it try's to be a good film, but it fails in some points. Robert Downey Jr. gives Iron Man 2 its fascination. The rest is a cluttered, clattering toy story. The general excellence of the casting trumps the inarguable excellence of the technology. This is a forgettable follow up to Iron Man and falls short on Part I in every way from its awful plot to its short action sequences, it is an awful movie but in some was it is still a good film. Iron Man 2 was a HUGE disappointment, it's the worst movie out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in my opinion and this sequel is rushed out. Iron Man 2 has lot's of problems I thought the last half got torn apart like it does.The best scenes are still the ones with Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow (as Stark's charm-resistant assistant, Pepper Potts), or just Downey alone. The rest feels like padding, which is something a sleek-suited superhero shouldn't need. Not only that This film was rushed out and it was really too long. This film shouldn't have Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) in it, making a prequel in it. Terrence Howard been replaced by Don Cheadle. Tony acting like a jerk again. On his birthday party been all drunk in an Iron Man Suit, not caring about his company beside Pepper. Don Cheadle as Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes stealing his suit and getting in to a fight with Tony was the worst idea and scene ever. Than they building weapons in the armor ""War Machine"" that JUST WASN'T RIGHT. This film isn't the best portraying film ever by a comic book, which the original is way better than this film is. Natasha Romanoff lying and spying on Tony was wrong and judging Tony was wrong. Romanoff beats all Justin Hamme's bodyguards while Happy fights in a boxing fight with one bodyguard and barely beats him. While Natasha Romanoff is John Rambo one woman army, kills everyone. Come on guys she knows martial arts but she is not a super invincible woman. She is a human been vulnerable like me and you.In my opinion she stole Iron Man's scenes, Tony should have saved Pepper again and stop the bad guys alone. He had a help ""War Machine ""on the end of the film. I still prefer Iron Man (2008) to this film, sorry. Lame one liners, non stop explosions but no one ever gets hurt (especially not the innocent civilians), and a very predictable story line makes for a dull movie.Iron Man 2 with a lot of problems isn't the worst sequel and it isn't bad at all. It does have scene ways that turn's in to good. It has a good things too in it. Iron Man showed the world just how much energy, rhythm, humor, sincerity, and quality filmmaking and storytelling could be crammed into a Superhero movie that managed to satisfy both longtime series fans and newcomers in search not of the perfect comic book adaptation but merely a well-crafted Summer blockbuster that delivered the goods without sacrificing story.I like Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash I thought he did a perfect job portraying a super villain and arch enemy of Iron Man in this film! Which I personally, think he did a better acting than the rest of the crew did. He is a professional and he can act the way he was told too. The fights between Iron Man and Whiplash on the track race were cool. I really love that. Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) is a combination of Iron Man's enemy the Crimson Dynamo (Dr Vanko, who wears weaponry/armour that can control electricity) and the supervillain Whiplash (who possesses a specially-designed razor/acid whip). That was awesome of making one of the most memorable super villains portraying by comic book even if it does have a little changes it is still good.I love the songs portrayed by AC/DC, the scores of the soundtrack a perfect to film. Even tough the film was not that good, I still did enjoyed in some scenes. Awesome cast, overpowering budget, & state of the art technology could do so much more, but by looking at the other reviews I'm certainly in the minority. The fights on the end of the film with CGI battling Iron Man with War Machine and successfully destroying the drones were terrific and I enjoyed with that. But that was all.Tough It was a A disappointing sequel and a disaster film I still like it and It was on a way still a good film, but the original was the best. I will still watch watch this film, even though it is a little let down but still watchable.Iron Man 2 is a 2010 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Iron Man, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures.7/10 Score: C Studio : Marvel Studios, Paramount Pictures Starring: Robert Downey, Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke, Samuel L.

I dosed off a while, and when one of the action scenes popped up, my head stood straight, and my eyes were open like a wolf that spotted an elk. The humor was excellent though.

Is it as good as Iron Man 1 or 3? No, but it is still amazing, and compared to some of the new mcu films, I'm sure everyone would be very happy to get another movie like this again. I also think that the newer movies are rated higher cause of more mcu fanboys and fan girls, but this movie came out when there were less fans and trust me to movie is amazing, it just didn't live up to the iron man 1 standard, but it's a great fun film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Lacks the punch of the first....still a decent watch,"I watched Iron man 2 with great expectations as i had recently watched the first Iron man on DVD and it had pleasantly surprised me. After watching this one, i felt that this movie too falls in the list of movies following the trend ...see it....enjoy it....forget it. Though it did not turn up as disappointing as some of the recent superhero sequels are but it is not half as good as the earlier Iron man edition. Nevertheless this is a decent watch mainly due to RDJ who portrays the superhero with effortless ease and incredible charm. But the movie as a whole does not offer anything very different from the usual summer blockbuster. The wit and charm of its prequel are clearly missing. Action scenes are relatively less and the characteristic one liners are few and far between. Still it has a lot of ""guilty pleasure""....which is a must for any movie of this genre. The Monaco race sequence episode has been done brilliantly and is the highpoint of the movie. Among the star cast Scarlett Johanson is a welcome change and Paltrow too got more screen time than the previous edition. Cheadle and Samuel Jackson haven't got much scope. But as stated earlier the movie belongs to RDJ who should increase his fan base after this movie. RDJ has an great screen presence and had lit up some of scenes by his charisma. The bottom line is that its an average popcorn flick but if you are a RDJ fan then perhaps you shouldn't miss this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
OK but only just,"Firstly, I should say that I loved first IRONMAN movie. Indeed in many respects it raised the bar for future comic / action hero movies. Like the revised Batman movies it was not afraid to be a bit darker, particularly the origin story at the beginning of IRONMAN 1.Sadly the sequel has none of that. I'd say the studio executives wanted something that would appeal to everyone and unfortunately they got it. It's a Magnolia paint of a movie.Why? Well whilst I did care about Tony Stark in the first movie, I did not connect with any of the characters this time around. The director features too much in the movie. The comedy is slightly overdone. Finally, the bad guys: an arms dealing moron and a Cape Fear bad guy reject just did not provide any sense of suspense. Not in the same why Jeff Bridges did. Pity because both actors could do better with better material.On the whole the special effects are good but the plot, script and story are poor.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A decent sequel,"Granted this movie has some flaws (but what movie doesn't?) and not as thrilling as the first Iron Man movie but it's still very enjoyable and has some very good points.Pretty much all the actors do very well and are well-cast. Like we're introduced to new characters like Justin Hammer, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. We see more of Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. We see Rhodey (now portrayed by Don Cheadle) become War Machine and battles along with Iron Man at the end. When I saw Cheadle as Rhodey, at first I didn't like how they changed the actor, but surprisingly he fit the role better than Terrence Howard. Robert Downey Jr. of course is spot on with his performance as Tony Stark being both arrogant and full of himself but also likable and charismatic at the same time. However, Gwyneth Paltrow was good as Pepper Potts and I liked how they showed more romance between her and Tony Stark but her nagging got kind of annoying. There's also a lot more lovely ladies in this one than the first one like Scarlett Johansson and the Ironettes.The action sequences and visual effects are very impressive too. However, the plot seems to be pretty slow in the middle but it gets better in the end.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Dimension,"Common sense hits the front office at Marvel's adventure in movie-making. Until now, they've just made bad films. Bad.The basic problem, I believe, is that the rest of the world is out exploiting the third dimension and Marvel insists on making flat movies. Even Spidermen, where the character lives and fights in space was flat. All of a sudden, Marvel and ILM wise up. This not only matches but excels what we have at this time in terms of complex three dimensional motion.The camera flies. Objects fly and the two weave in ways new to us. The camera is usually placed in some relatively stationary place to allow you to see what is going on. That place is removed from the action. Sometimes the camera becomes or emulates a POV of a flying or moving object as if it is in the action — or perhaps a character. The game in this new future is a matter of combining the two so that it has the properties of both, but is neither.Done well, it generates pure cinematic excitement. Done well, it overwhelms everything else and thrills because it is so otherworldly. It is done well here. Done well. And it doesn't have to be used to cloud deficiencies elsewhere. All is at least competent and some things: Downey, Rockwell and the production design are excellent.This dimensional thing is done so well that it is mirrored elsewhere. Stark's computers have a hand and voice manipulatable three dimensional, haptic, multiaffordance holographic interface. The motion is less important here than the notion of projected dimensionality. His nemesis? Well, he manages an entire army of drones by a single QWERTY keyboard and a DOS-like display. The contrast is, I think a deliberate thing. They would have pimped up Stark's machine anyway, but having the contrast is a subtle narrative reminder of the difference in dimensionality of the thing.Oh, it is also mirrored in the two women. One is a lighthaired, ponytailed redhead who never leaves the plane. The other is a fiery darker redhead with wild hair (in her real persona) who in a remarkable fight scene is profoundly three-dimensional.Samuel Jackson has decided to do anything, work anywhere, take any pay cut to be the face of the master organization that watches us. I think he knows that this legacy will live for generations, planted in juvenile minds eager for explanatory conspiracies. These theories for some reason rarely are discarded as kids age. It is his face now that is often associated with the leader of the new demigods the genre is creating. Smart building of intellectual property for someone with limited range.Downey. What a guy. Let's hope he takes some of his power to create projects that matter in some way beyond merely thrilling by advancing the craft of seeing.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Superior sequel,"In many ways to me at least is better than the first one to the cast, acting, pace, thrills and definitely more witty and entertaining. Robert Downey Jr. is on the top of his game here as Tony Stark he was cool, funny, brilliant and bad@ss but maybe a bit too cocky but that's his character I guess. The supporting cast was great and Scarlett Johansson though hot as always looks better than ever and she really impressed me here, Mickey Rourke made an effective villain but I could hardly understand him most of the time or bought the accent, Samuel Jackson is cool as always but the standout person here was Sam Rockwell but Gwyneth Paltrows and Don Cheadles character really didn't do much for me this time around sorry to say. I really had a fun time watching this flick from beginning to end and it really surpassed my expectations and it's definitely what a summer blockbuster should be, an escape. The final act wasn't as thrilling or effective as the final act in the first one but it was definitely exciting but it kind of left me wanting more still just like in the first one but just like what Spider Man did for me this will probably get better and better with each sequel and I can't wait! Overall it has solid performances, action, laughs, thrills and it was just brilliantly done, an improvement but there is still some flaws to be tinkered with but I still recommend it for the fun of it all.

I was wrong; I thought this was better, a more likable and entertaining film than the first! Of course, it helps to know in advance that the ""hero"" (""Ton Stark,"" played by Robert Downey) is even more obnoxious in this film. Knowing that, I didn't let that bother me and just enjoyed the good acting in here and the excellent special-effects.Mickey Rourke (""Ivan Vanko"") is almost always interesting to watch so I enjoyed his role, too, even if I had a hard time understanding his Russian accent.The story is, yes, sophomoric but most action films today are. Just enjoy the funny lines, CGI, the pretty women (Gwyneth Paltrow and Scarlett Johannson) and wild heroes and villains and you should get your money's worth out of the viewing. See it on Blu-Ray and you'll enjoy it that much more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another great superhero movie!,"IRON MAN 2 was as good as it gets for superhero movies. It is a well-built story using characters and situations dating back to the 1960's. (Hence the nice addition of Tony Stark's dad in filmstrip sequences). The rivalry between him and a cold war Russian inventor plays out a generation later between Tony and the inventor's son, a character known as Whiplash (but never actually called that in the movie). I have to say the writing was top-notch and the characters excellently portrayed. For any armchair psychologists out there, the child-rearing theory of nature vs. nurture surfaces in Whiplash' origin. The young boy grew up in a climate of hate, and well, this is what happens. OK, getting too deep, more on the fun stuff...Paltrow as Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts, the director as ""Happy"" Hogan, and Rockwell as Justin Hammer all did a great job. Mickey Rourke dialed it down a notch and was superb. You will get some laughs from Favreau, functioning mostly as a chauffeur. Adding in the Black Widow (Scarlett Johanson) was a stroke of genius. Her fight sequence deserved applause! A nice touch: her decorative belt rings (first seen in Spiderman issue #86, 1970) became her weapons. Very cool! There's a reason I didn't mention Don Cheadle as Rhodey. His wooden performance was the weak spot of the whole film. I don't get it because he is such a great actor. But his presence was toxic and it looked like he threw off the other actors (noticeably Downey Jr).This film is great fun, balancing character development, science (best invention - Hammer's ""Ex-wife"" missile), thrills, politics and laughs. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Spider-Man 3 Syndrome: Exhibit: C,"The first Iron Man was different from your average comic book movie because it lacked the unnecessary drama, instead replacing it with many more laughs, a much more likable main character, and plenty of comic book flair usually missing from the other comic movies. With the success of Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to go forth with their long-waited and epic idea to bring a few of their best heroes together into one massive flick that will make anybody that is a fan of comic books squeal with glee and delight. The Avengers is sure to become the biggest addition of comic book film-making since the original Spider-Man broke barriers and records many years ago. The Avengers will be incredible.Which leads to the biggest issue of Iron Man 2: the film is just a tad notch above set-up flick. Just like what Dead Man's Chest in the Pirates franchise did, Iron Man 2 became a 2-hour movie with a slew of conflicts in which were not all resolved because there is another installment coming. Suffering from the Spider-Man 3 effect, Iron Man 2 is chock full of story lines interweaving together, and not all of them are interesting, and not all of them even reach a resolution. We see more Tony Stark than Iron Man. The cameos steal the spotlight. Some of the villains were whether annoying or as much of a threat as a newborn puppy. Many pieces were built around the set, but not all of them fit.Tony Stark 2—er, I mean, Iron Man 2 is about our hero (Robert Downey Jr.) taking on the government, rivals, and even his own health—which is depleting rapidly because of hit artificial ""heart."" With his health slowly dying away, he starts drinking, acting even more eccentric, and even stepped down from his CEO duties. In the meantime, the Iron Man technology is being imitated around the world, with an intelligent Russian (Mickey Rourke) trying to kill Stark with his own version of a powersuit. Justin Theroux provides the screenplay, and stuffs it up with cameos, references to the future, problems, villains, and a few plot lines from old-school Iron Man comic book issues. A lot goes on.Let's at least marvel at the powerhouse cast. Robert Downey Jr. does an excellent job as Tony Stark/Iron Man yet again, providing a great blend of narcissism with subtle fear of death. Gwyneth Paltrow doesn't get much screen time yet again but does a great job with the material she has. Other performances throughout the movie were very good, including Garry Shandling, Mickey Rourke, Samuel L. Jackson, Sam Rockwell, Don Cheadle, and to an extent Scarlett Johansson (whose fighting skills nearly stole the entire show). Great performances, but nearly all the supporting actors I mentioned didn't have much time to truly craft a whimsical, memorable performance to the likes of Heath Ledger as the Joker, Rosemary Harris as Aunt May, or William Dafoe as Green Goblin.The acting isn't the only thing chock full of small samples and no main course; there was little action, little tension, little chemistry between the two leads, and little suspense. What progresses the movie and prevented it from being a total disaster was Robert Downey Jr. entertaining the masses with his portrayal of Stark. Granted this is a movie about Tony Stark, but the film is called Iron Man, and one would hope for more of him in the suit. As a matter of fact, Iron Man engages in action in only three scenes, with one of them being extremely short. Just like in the original, the final epic battle was extremely short, extremely underwhelming, and very anti-climactic. Whiplash could have been an intimidating force to the likes of the Joker (in both versions, shut up), Doc Ock in Spider-Man 2, and Syndrome in The Incredibles (not a Marvel villain but a comic book-like villain nonetheless).Like a cruelly beautiful woman, the film is a big tease. There are a lot of characters, but they aren't in the film enough. The special effects were very good, but were not used a lot for the action scenes. Plenty of hints and references towards other Marvel comic books, but none of them lasted more than a minute (even though the last one was indeed------wow). Another problem is that the freshness and originality of Iron Man disappeared, which made this a tougher follow-up than one would assume. Is the film disappointing? Yea, loosely. Is it entertaining? Most definitely, but the potential carried is what makes this a somewhat-frustrating movie. It made most of us beg like an unsatisfied bum for 2011 and 2012 to arrive so we can see more (and longer) comic book crossovers.Bottom Line: Iron Man 2 is most definitely entertaining and loads of fun—sometimes. Other times, we are watching a storyline we don't really care about, watching appearances we know should last longer, or watching potential get ruined because it's being carried over to the next installment of the Marvel movie-making franchise. While this is more script issues than directing issues (Jon Favreau did a decent job, but his character wasn't necessary at all), someone during the production should have stood up and shouted ""What's with all the loose Walt Disney references??""Wait, wait, wait, I meant ""Isn't this a repeat of what happened to Spider-Man 3??"" Iron Man 2 = Spider-Man 3, except more fun, much less embarrassing, and a better-looking future. The film isn't a boring disaster, but you are constantly left with a desire for more--long before the movie is even over. Now why can't this Avengers movie come faster?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Sub-Standard time wasting empty  story i.e. Garbage,"This film is a disgrace to it's predecessor- Fact. The word redundant scenes takes on new meaning. If you were teaching a class in redundant scenes (i.e. scenes that tell you nothing, contribute nothing to the story or the plot, but just help to get the film to its status of two hours of a waste of people's time).How many scenes have no direction and could be dropped in anyplace, or to any film. What about the silly dialog? The emergence of characters based solely on their personalities, Jackson for example. You have quality actors in this film looking like very bad actors. The roles given to them and the motives of the characters are paper thin. The only person that looked mean and meant it was Rouke. How many times have we seen the Sam Jackson character. I swore he looked like Shaft returned.Anyone giving this film a rating higher than 4 has no idea about quality. It sounds bold but it is how serious I feel about this zero (if i could) rating. Last film I saw was Titans, and that was at least marginally engaging with a obvious plot, but it followed a plot - at least. Was it asking too much to have a believable story from start to end?Another film which pulls steals peoples money, and the Hollywood industry is so poor these days that people are forced to watch nonsense like this and then say it was ""fun"".",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Weak, but not terrible.","Just going to get this out of the way. Iron Man 2 does not exceed it's predecessor in any way. The plot is beyond predictable, the acting is great with solid performances coming from all of the leads, and the special effects are good.The plot is simple enough. Jon Favreau clearly played it safe, which at least is better then the disaster that Spider-Man 3 was, but everyone was expecting much more from him this time around. The motivations for almost all the characters don't really make sense (I'm looking at Ivan Yenko and Rhodey here), but it still is enough to move the plot forward at a fairly brisk pace.Unfortuneatly this movie seemed pretty determined to show off all the new gizmos and gadgets Tony had developed in the slight time period between the two movies. As cool as it may have been, that ""oooh ahhh"" effect does not carry a movie.The acting was great, with an absolutely amazing cast giving exceptional performances. Don Cheadle did a great job taking over for Terence Howard, Robert Downey Jr was as amazing as usual and Mickey Rourke was a perfect choice for the antagonist.Strangely enough, Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L Jackson had absolutely tiny roles in the movie, more serving as part of a prelude to ""The Avengers"". Why they felt they needed to blow their budget on some big name actors/actresses that they hardly used over a bolder writer I don't know.The effects were good, but still nothing special. I thought they nailed Whiplash (Thank god they avoided the leather outfit that was seen in the comic books), and some of the better action scenes had some great destruction, which we all love of course.If you REALLY liked Iron Man 1, you will like this. If you thought the first was okay, then this is probably a renter for you. Overall this was a passive move by marvel entertainment after a few hits (by the way could you please make another hulk movie?).Oh well, don't come expecting too too much.7/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Only enjoyed 30mins in total,"The movie has a few scattered visual scenes which are amazing, as well as the usual Iron Man/Robert Downey Jr. Comedy which are brilliant - but these make up about 30mins running time of the movie - the rest is fluf and plot-less. I wanted to love IM2 - I really really did - but i found myself checking the time for when it was over a few times. The action was really condensed into the final 15mins, which by then, was too late. The introduction of ""The Avengers"" was a frustrating distraction to the overall plot, and I felt sorry for Samuel L. Jackson who deserved better than 10min of screen time which makes little sense to the plot. I'm going to rewatch the first Iron Man at home to restore my faith in the franchise. Hope Iron Man 2 doesn't kill the franchise and they pick things up with a better plot and a more even spread of action in Iron Man 3.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not as Great as the first, but Still A Good Sequel","THE first ""Iron Man"" was such a well-crafted and fun movie that its sequel would be hard put to keep up the standard. Well, this one, directed by Jon Favreau, tries hard and is nearly there. It has all that one would expect from an ""Iron Man"" sequel, even if it is unevenly plotted in some places.What's more, there is Mickey Rourke thundering in as the menacing Ivan 'Whiplash' Vanko and the sexy Scarlett Johansson as the ass-kicking Natalie Rushman (a cover for Black Widow?).The narcissistic and egoistic Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) has owned up to being Iron Man. Under pressure from the US government, the press and the public to share his technology with the military, Tony is unwilling to divulge the secrets behind the Iron Man armour because he fears the information will get into the wrong hands.Meanwhile, Tony's past is coming back to haunt him. A demented Russian inventor named Ivan Vanko (Rourke) seeks revenge for the wrongs that had been done to his father. With Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and James 'Rhodey' Rhodes (Don Cheadle) at his side, Tony forges new alliances and confronts the powerful new forces that have ganged up on him.The most nail-biting and inventive sequence of the movie comes about 20 minutes into the movie - at the Grand Prix scene where Ivan causes some spectacular mayhem and destruction. After that, every thing seems to pale beside it. The CGI sequences of the armoured men and droids battles bring a sense of deja vu, especially if you recall the actions of the first film. The other 'villain' of the film, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), remains very much a caricature (even if the film is adapted from a comic book) while Garry Shandling seems to be playing Gary Shandling rather than Senator Stern.There are a few pleasant surprises though. They are Samuel L. Jackson as the hard-talking Nick Fury and of course, Johansson who lights up every scene she is in. Paltrow maintains her charm as Tony Stark's assistant Pepper Potts but she is overshadowed by the nubile and fighting-fit Johansson. At least she helps us forget the 'down' moments of the movie when director Favreau delves into Tony's 'electronic heart' and blood problems.All in all, director Favreau has kept the faith and maintained the thrills and spills of the flying Tin Man. - By LIM CHANG MOH (limchangmoh.blogspot.com)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Too bad it's not like ""The Dark Knight""!","I had colossal expectations for this movie. That was a bad mistake. I expected to relive ""The Dark Knight"" moment. A perfect sequel. I expected Mickey Rourke to give a performance worthy of Heath Ledgers Joker and I hoped for a deep and intriguing story. Alas none of my hopes and dreams came true. But it was still a pretty good movie.No need to waste words on the visuals. They are everything you expect them to be in a modern Marvel movie - marvelous.The acting is pretty solid. Robert Downey Jr. was cool, funny, egocentric and everything you expect Tony Stark to be. I though I would miss Terrence Howard but Don Cheadle did a good job as a recast Rhodes. I was a little disappointed at Rourke, he did a pretty swell job but still it was not one of his best performances. Maybe I got that impression because of the lack of depth the writers gave the character, or maybe the very little dialog he had.The action was nice and entertaining and as its predecessor it had a few very funny moments nicely and delicately put in place. Also there was a few details that made the whole experience a little more special like Don Cheadles opening line that went something like ""It's me, I'm here, get used to it."", and can be understood as a response to the recast from Terrence Howard.All in all it's a very entertaining and visually beautiful movie, but it falls a little short from Iron Man (2008). The story maybe has the depth but the presentation of it felt a little rushed. It also felt like the movie should be at least 20 minutes longer or so. Also the soundtrack hasn't got the power of the first movie.If you love Marvel you will probably like this movie. If you like action you will probably like this movie. If you liked Iron Man from 2008 you will probably like this movie. And if you see Iron Man 2 levelheaded and not bearing sky high expectations you will probably love this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A good sequel but stop a tad too short of being perfect,"For those of you who said there is little or no story in this movie, just what were you watching? The couple making out in front of you, or were you busy attending to your SMS or email messages? Now I just got to know that Sam Rockwell was a contender for the role of Iron Man/Tony Stark in the first film, I am so glad he didn't get the part and Robert Downey Jr did.In the first movie we got to see a lot more of Iron Man, while Tony Stark stood quietly in the background. In the sequel it is Tony Stark that matters more than Iron Man. In fact Iron Man has become a mere tool for ego and fame and is beginning to become a liability to SI and tony. Unfortunately there isn't enough running time for the director to explore the deeper character of Tony Stark and his struggle with his alter ego and alcohol. Shame.Pepper Pott should have had more anger, anguish and frustration, but the character was not explored.I agree with some reviewers in saying that there is likely a spin-off in the Black Widow character. Although I must say, Scarlet Johannson's performance was a bit off. I always thought the character to be quite a bit colder, as in an ice queen.Is it me or is Samuel L. Jackson putting on tens of pounds?! I could hardly recognize him in the café scene with Robert Downey Jr!!! Shame that Sam Rockwell is still playing villain. He is quite a versatile actor who is constantly under-utilized and under appreciated.Notice how I am talking about characters and not story or the SFX? Well, for those of you watching this movie thinking there is a better story than the first, you do know that you are watching a sequel to a comic superhero screen adaptation. 30-40 years of history does not shrink well into a 2 hour movie... it won't even fit a 10 hour one.As for special effects, what else can you not expect to be thrown into a modern blockbuster like this? Heck, even the kitchen sink can be entirely CG! What's new since Jurassic Park? Overall, there is perhaps a re-watch value somewhere, but it is definitely worth the price of the ticket you pay the first time round.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Brilliant.,"Call me biased if you will, because I admit I was completely taken with the first movie, but I absolutely loved this film. I went into it knowing I would enjoy it either way, but fully prepared to admit it if it wasn't good. There are a lot of people saying this was disappointing. Those people are everywhere, in every board, for every film. Pay them no mind, and I encourage you to go and see this film for yourself, make your own judgement.With amazing effects, and just the perfect balance between character development and action, this movie has it all. It picks up directly where the first one left off, and gives us everything we loved from the first film and then some. The suit got more advanced, the bad guys got badder, and the tension between Tony and Pepper went up a notch. Any loose strings from the first film are tied up nicely, and I'm happy to say that Stark is every bit as egotistical and brilliant as he was in Iron Man. As for Potts, while some complain about her, I really don't see the problem. Pepper is easily the most relatable character, not just in Iron Man, but in every superhero film, as far as female leads go.Comparisons should not influence your decision, because there is no film quite like this one out there, aside from the first installment. A firm ten out of ten from me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Tony Stark still has the Spark,"The waiting and wondering have finally paid off. It's here, and handsomely boasts a cast ready to do justice to the unforeseen successor that is Iron Man.Tony Stark - quirky Downey Jr. who makes the role seem unplayable by anyone else, is full of his usual cocky charisma in this second outing along with the return of Pepper Pots and Rhodey whose character is welcomely replaced by Don Cheadle, who as fans will know by the trailer, gets his fair share of action in this sequel.Set straight after the memorable ending of Iron Man, numero two doesn't hesitate to have a crazy Russian plotting to end dear Tony's life within the first few minutes. Which isn't at all helped by jealous weapons specialist Hammer played by Sam Rockwell, who proves to be a dangerous foe indeed. At least like most people Tony can always depend on a one eyed Samuel L Jackson or a silver sidekick to help him out in these tough times.Thankfully director Jon Favreau hasn't made the same mistake Michael Bay and Co. did with Transformers 2 by trying to build on the same ideas as the original and add so many characters you forget what film you are watching. But that doesn't mean Iron Man 2 is without its flaws.The main downside - like almost every sequel made, is the story and characters don't seem to have half the impact they had the first time round and you find yourself praying the film will start to be everything you ever hoped for. With the finished result feeling like an unassembled but still quite appealing mess. And since the first Iron Man had such success you'd think it might have easily been one of the rare exceptions. Still, if it is like the first one this will definitely be a film that grows on you the more you watch it.Now since that proved very 'I'm not persuaded to watch this yet.' let's compensate by the fact that there is still plenty of fun to be found as well as lots of action sequences in this sequel; Whiplash (Rourke)'s sequence in particular will probably put off anyone hoping to be Formula One drivers for life, but it's often these most barmy scene's that make you forget about why the plot is so simple.To not leave any readers of this review feeling too heartbroken; the following four words are likely to seal the deal for any man/lesbian to still feel up to watching this, which they should since this is far from terrible.

"Like Tony Stark: Mass appeal, but ultimately shallow.","In this highly anticipated sequel to acclaimed pseudo-hero film Iron Man, director Jon Favreau flaunts an all-star cast including Downey Jnr., Rourke, Paltrow, Johansson, Cheadle, Rockwell and Jackson in a part-blockbuster, part-dramedy romp that ultimately delivers what it promises, but isn't without its faults.We follow the life of Tony Stark, and how he deals with the pressure and responsibilities of being Iron Man, apparently the world's only saviour and the only man who can claim to have 'successfully privatised world peace.' Tony is a troubled superhero, a far cry from the typically one-dimensional characters we're used to seeing in this genre, and on that front, there is some depth to this film. On the flipside, we are introduced to Ivan 'Whiplash' Vanko, the token evil Russian physicist intent on taking down Iron Man for reasons that (unfortunately) are not entirely clear or motive-driven.Despite this, each main actor in this film delivers at least a satisfactory performance. With each film he stars in, RDJ flirts dangerously with the line of being typecast as the smart-ass anti-hero, and Iron Man 2 is yet another example of that. However, it is obvious he enjoys being Tony Stark and his sharp delivery compliments his excessive flow of off-the-cuff one- liners nicely.While Paltrow, Johansson, Jackson and Rockwell do just what is expected of them in their respective roles, it is Rourke who makes a thoroughly pleasing turn as Vanko. Although a motive and backstory is all but non-existent in the context of his character, his commitment to the Russian accent and anti-social tendencies of a man who has just spent the last quarter of a century in prison just goes to show that, somewhere between his personal problems and willingness to put down others in the profession, we forgot that Rourke is, simply, a good actor.This film actually suffers from too much star power in more than a few instances. Favreau is obviously working a multitude of angles here (some significant and some very minor) but it is apparent he hasn't quite mastered the art of ensemble filmmaking. While RDJ gets the screen time he deserves, other characters (including Vanko) just seem to fall by the wayside as the climax approaches, and are all thrown together in the concluding scenes to wrap up the film in a neat little package.Plot holes appear occasionally from both a scientific and political perspective. Usually, the realism factor in a superhero movie would be a non-issue, but because Favreau goes to such great lengths to recreate our world in its modern context, one cannot help but point out physical and technical impossibilities; the kind likely to make cinema-goers sit back, roll their eyes, and assure their friend that 'there's no way he could have possibly survived that in real life.'Ultimately, Iron Man 2 does keep the viewer entertained for its duration with adequate performances all round and tight, magnetic pacing, but never advances beyond the level of being a mere stepping stone for The Avengers (2012), and Mr. Stark, instead of being the self-assured individual he was in the original Iron Man, ends up being nothing more than just another piece of the puzzle.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

"Iron Man 2, another fun and great film","It's fun and fast-paced. Robert Downey Jr. delivers again, with all the cast doing great jobs. Contrary to popular (critic) belief, Iron Man 2 brings another enjoyable superhero film to watch. The storyline continues to unfold, the action and effects are nice, and the actors all did well.Whatever complaints other people might have on the story, the events, the lack of or excess of - it may be true, but that doesn't make it less of a great movie. Iron Man 2 was more character driven, and you truly do see many of the past characters and new ones develop. Thanks to the well-picked cast, all of the characters were fun to watch. They gave emotion and humor together, and I'm too lazy to talk about each of them individually, but Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark was definitely the savior of the whatever flaws the movie has. As he said himself, he is Iron Man, and his personality made the movie very lively.As expected, you got to see awesome Iron Man action with lots of explosions and whatnot. Some might say that there was too much mindless blasting, like Transformers, but that's what made it fun. It mixed in with the characters evenly I think, and it's an overall great and fun movie throughout.Not saying it didn't disappoint in some parts (which it did), but you can't please everyone. I find the first Iron Man to be better, but that was because it was a new, cool idea that just bursted out. However, Iron Man 2 continues as a worthy sequel.

There's a great movie in here somewhere.,"MCU 2021 MarathonMCU #3:I enjoyed Iron Man 2 much more on this re-watch. It was definitely all over the place and too long, but you can see how it subtly sets up the best of the series, Iron Man 3.And whoever is in charge of casting at this point forward in the MCU should get an Oscar.Robert Downey Jr. is again excellent, flipping from the entitled sarcastic playboy to the brooding dude with daddy issues to the manic inventor and boy-genius.Mickey Rourke oozes Russian bad-boy masculinity as the villain. His scenes in the first act are excellent.And then there's of course the introduction of Scarlet Johanssen as Natasha/Black Widow. Damn if she doesn't suck up all the air in every single scene she's in as she insinuates herself into Stark's inner circle. She morphs from Tony's ""siren"" (Stark's a better man than I would likely be in a similar circumstance) to a bad-ass MMA fighter.It actually calls out the absurdity of not spinning off a Black Widow off earlier. This was clearly pre-Me Too, but shameful nonetheless.The special effects are again excellent. The first big fight scene at the Monaco 500 scene and the suited up fist fight between Iron Man and Rhodes/War Machine are epic.""Sir! I'm gonna have to ask you to exit the doughnut.""Nick Fury",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
One of the best movies of marvel studios.,"First, this film is for fans, no for general public, I'm a big fan of marvel and I see this film 6 times, this film is great, casting was excellent, in this movie I see the shield of captain America, the hammer of Thor, and many cameos of the other heroes, black widow was excellent, i love her, mickey Rourke as whiplash was great, war machine was excellent, people say that this film have a little action and many villains, they are wrong, because a villain doesn't count his physical and weapons, but his intelligence, whiplash created his robots and he use them as pawns first to confront stark, not all is combat body to body, also has its advantages, i love this film and I'll wait for iron man 3 and I want see the mandarin.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Captures the spirit of Marvel in cast Iron,"Tony Stark reveals his superhero alter ego identity and while resisting calls by the government to hand over the Iron Man technology he finds himself threatened by a new enemy.I'm happy to say there's not much to dislike about Actor/Director Jon Favreau's excellent follow up to 2008's blend of comic book action, humour and effects.Iron Man 2 picks up where the first one left off, as billionaire Tony Stark must contend with the government, his own friends, as well as new enemies played by the wonderful Sam Rockwell and the perfectly cast Mickey Rourke.Thankfully Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt and looks great as the Black Widow, although the costumes cuffs looked a little out of place. Don Cheadle unnecessarily replaces Terence Howard as Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes but is just as good, phew!The leads; Gwyneth Paltrow surprisingly cast in this role returns and is the grounded back bone of the film. Robert Downey Jr. once again is fantastic as the witty extrovert Stark. There's lot of emotion as you see Stark's father and a glimpse of their relationship. Downey's acting captures Stark's battles with his mortality and his alter ego fittingly.The effects are well executed and don't detract from the action or story in anyway. Fans will enjoy nods and references including The Avengers, Captain America and Samuel L. Jackson's second Nick Fury cameo, to name a few.Again there's a great script and storyline that zips along at a nice pace backed by a fitting music score and rock tracks. Personally, I feel it's better than Iron Man due to it's sharper editing and sleeker look. Stick around until after the end credits as there is a nice teaser of another superhero.Like the Fantastic 4's films all in all Iron Man 2 is the perfect comic book flick that captures the spirit of Marvel, it's just a shame Sam Raimi's Spiderman didn't have the same perfect blend of drama, action and adventure that Iron Man has...",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"Too much Potts, too many suplots and too long to get to the suited- Scarlett shots.","The beauty of the original film was that at focused on the origins of the character, a side-benefit of that was the fact that it had Robert Downey Jr in the lead as the charismatic billionaire playboy Tony Stark. Let's face it, following Stark around for the first 40 odd minutes was as much fun as the bits where he put the claustrophobic's nightmare suit on and fanged around with rock music playing in the background.Now for #2, we've been there and done that.Perhaps that's why they chose to focus the first 10 minutes on establishing the new playa in town Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) who it must be said looks like he is carved out of wax in this film? Perhaps the lethal cocktails of drugs, alcohol and steroids that he has ingested over the years has pre-embalmed him from the inside out? In any case he looks creepy, which is a good thing I guess as a villain.Vanko is the son of an ex-colleague of Tony Stark's Dad, who was the original brilliant scientist and inventor who set up Stark Industries in the first place.Vanko's Dad has just died, and he has decided he does not like Tony Stark one bit.I think I'll take a breath to point out that Iron Man 2 is a good film, but not the great one as some have suggested, and like Spiderman 2 it is nowhere near as good as the original, (why does everyone talk Spidey 2 up? It was mediocre at best.) The problem is that they tried to force too many new bad guys in, and tried to bring in subplots for Pepper Potts of all people, even Stark's bodyguard gets his own couple scenes, I know he is the director but give me a break! What I am trying to say is that they took too long to get Scarlett Johansson in the catsuit, and once they did she only got a few minutes to strut her latex clad stuff. (For all the reports about her frontal assets I need to say that there is strong competition from behind... so to speak.) Everyone now knows that Stark is also Iron Man, and the government wants him to hand over the suit so that they can do... whatever with it. What everyone doesn't know is that the very thing keeping Stark ticking is also slowly killing him, and he desperately researches every possibility that might prolong his life and save him.Along the way a nifty young lawyer named Natalie (Johansson) moves into Tony Stark's radar screen, he is entranced by her various skills and capabilities - and no doubt by her amazing rack and smokin' body - and appoints her his personal assistant. This is handy for the latter part of the story, (and hopefully a sequel that will ideally take place in either a sauna or nudist colony. I will be happy in either case.) Pepper seems a little perturbed (jealous) by her presence... but who the hell cares? Once Vanko and Stark finally are introduced all logic and plausibility flies out the window. This is OK in small doses as leaps of logic are required in any superhero film, but the first film took such pains to show just how all these crazy events could almost be believed in so-called real life that changing tack and throwing logic out the window is annoying. So many leaps were required that I was puffing and my knees were sore by the end of the first Iron Man / Ivan Vanko battle.Vanko and Hammer ultimately team up to move towards their dual goals, for Vanko revenge for Hammer the #1 spot.Nick Fury (Sam L Jackson) pops in (contractually obliged to be in almost every Marvel superhero film for eternity) and informs Stark that he knew his Dad, and that he might revisit some old home movies for advice and perhaps assistance.(I soooo wanted to bag Mickey Rourke as the bad guy, especially when I knew he was to be a Russian. I thought his accent would be tortuous but it actually wasn't, at least right until the very end. I think he did OK in a mostly non-speaking role but didn't add much to the film bar his saggy cheating death appearance.) When watched in isolation Iron Man 2 is a bit of a muddy mess at times that survives largely on the goodwill and credibility forged by the far superior original. I liked bits of it and think the franchise definitely has more in it to come, but feel a little let down by this one. Perhaps that's why I waited almost 2 months to watch the damn thing after it came out.Final Rating - 7 / 10. Worth a look, but the original was far superior. Less Potts, less Roads, fewer bad guys, more Scarlett in the suit and a return of the more palatable Tony Stark for 3 please Mr Favreau. I'll even let you have your own pointless sub-plot if you do that for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Great Sequel,"Iron Man caught me by surprise when It hit theatres back in 2008. Heading in I was thinking how the hell are they going to pull this off. Iron Man ended up being one of the best comic book movies ever, and it was only a matter of time for a sequel.Iron Man 2 is not as good as the original, but it is still a great film and should stand on it's own. We get to see a different side of Tony Stark as he spiral's out of control. We also get to see more interaction between himself and Nick Fury who made an appearance after the credits of the original.The action sequences in Iron Man 2 are spectacular and are a work of art. I was really impressed with the special effect's used especially in the final scenes. The camera angles during the flying sequences were handled very well.Robert Downy's portrayal of Tony Stark is one of a kind and awesome. I don't think anyone could've been able to play Tony Stark as well as Robert Downy which is impressive. Mickey Rourke had me convinced he was really Russian. His performance as Ivan Vanko was Great. He had a creepy vibe going for his character which really added to the plot. Scarlett Johansson blended in really well as ""the Black Widow"". Her fight scenes were pretty damn good. Sam Rockwell in my opinion stole the show. He was hilarious throughout as Tony Stark's rival ""Justin Hammer"". He had some good one liners and his interaction with Ivan were awkward and funny. I was hoping for Terence Howard to reprise his role as colonel Rhodes but Don Cheadle did a great job as a replacement, so that did not bother me as much.The original Iron Man will be hard to beat as the bar was set so high, however for a sequel, Iron Man 2 is a great follow up. I felt that the action sequences were a lot better compared to the original, It's weakness was the storyline and plot which at times seemed clustered and can confuse you. Still, those little problems did not hinder my enjoyment and I thought Iron Man 2 was solid followup to the original.7.0/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 2 A Bit Disappointing But Decent,"Iron Man 2 is a bit disappointing yet decent comic book sequel. Don't get me wrong it's okay but there's was too much talking and not enough action. I enjoyed Inception this summer a lot more than this one. Robert Downey is solid as Tony Stark but even he can't save this from being a bit of a disappointment compared to the first one. He's everything Tony Stark should be and is still a perfect choice for the character none the less. Gwyneth Paltrow does what she can as Pepper Popps despite not having a whole lot to do.Don Cheadle is all right as Jim Rhodes and War Machine who's involved in the action more than the previous one. Scarlet Johannson is decent as Natalie Rushman/The Black Widow who like Paltrow doesn't have much to do except for a third act action sequence which is okay while it lasts. Sam Rockwell is a good actor (Moon, and Machstick Men) but I actually found him to be rather annoying as Justin Hammer one of the villains if you want to call the role that. I think it was more the character than him who I thought is annoying. He wasn't menacing or threatening to Tony at all. Rockwell did however a bring some comic relief to the movie.Mickey Rourke's underused as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash who is intimidating even with very little dialog and screen time. They could've done a lot more with his character who after an impressive display of destruction at the race track he takes a back seat for a large part of the movie particularly the second half. He shows up briefly near the end only to be dispatched as quickly as he appears. Whiplash didn't turn to be as much of a threat to Tony as he could've been.Samuel L Jackson does his usual thing as Nick Fury in a small role considering he has only two scenes with Downey Jr. He's in it for five minutes tops to set up the upcoming Avengers movie and Kate Mara is wasted in an early cameo appearance. The story itself was kind of predictable, and the few action sequences were so-so but they missing that wow factor. Most of the action happens in the third act which turns out to be a bit of a letdown because it's over too fast. The only one that had any real intensity to it was at the race track when Rourke's Whiplash confronts Tony for the first time.There's a lot of talking in the second half and almost no action except for a fight between a drunk Tony and Rhodes in Iron Man suits which weighed it down a bit. Not that there has to be constant explosions, fist fights, and violence every 10 minutes but some more spectacle would've made it better. And for a movie called Iron Man I was surprised about how little we actually see Stark in the suit. This movie suffered the same problem that Spider-man 3 had of trying to put too much into one film with mixed results. Actor/Director Jon Favreau is admirable in making this sequel despite it's flaws that further develops Downey's Tony Stark which isn't necessarily a bad thing but certain key characters (Potts, Rhodes, Black Widow, and Whisplash) unfortunately aren't given much development and lack screen time.The fight at the end with Downey's Iron Man and Cheadler's War Machine facing off against Rourke's Wiplash is over in like 30 seconds was a big disappointment because it felt rushed. What was the point of him showing up after the drones were killed if he's just going to get killed off thirty seconds later. There wasn't any danger or suspense to speak of and dispatching the main villain in such a short battle at the end seemed like a wasted opportunity to show how dangerous he could be. Overall this movie really isn't that bad. Iron Man 2 has some action, drama, a little humor, and solid performances by the cast (Robert Downey Jr) for the most part it just could've been better.The part with a drunk Tony in an Iron Man suit wasn't all that funny either. I prefer The Dark Knight over this sequel as far as comic book movies go because it delivered everything you could want or expect from one of those films. Iron Man 2 on the other hand wasn't as good as the original which is shame because I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't help feeling a little disappointed after watching it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Downey Jr. and Rockwell are outstanding, but this sequel lacks the balance and energy of its predecessor","Without a doubt, Iron Man was a total knockout when it was released in early 2008. It was an all around awesome movie that surprised just about everyone with how well made it was. Having Robert Downey Jr. sizzle in the lead role likely helped, as did the blend of action, thrills and laughs. It was a great start to the summer, and one of the few movies people remembered even came out that year after The Dark Knight was unleashed almost three months later. With hype running high on Iron Man 2, is there any way it could even possibly match up to the original film?The film opens with an interesting introduction to Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a Russian physicist who does not appear to be much of a fan of Tony Stark (Downey Jr.). Rather quickly, the film jumps a few months after Stark's announcement to the world that he is Iron Man. He has become an even bigger celebrity, has helped bring peace to a few warring nations, and the US government is hounding him to hand over the technology for military use. And that is just the start of his new set of problems to go along with his new public identity.While Iron Man was a fairly straight forward story with fairly little jumping, at times, Iron Man 2 feels like a convoluted mess. On top of Stark coming to terms with his new life and problems with long time friends and colleagues Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Jim Rhodes (Don Cheadle, replacing Terrence Howard), writer Justin Theroux throws in rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) to turn up the heat alongside Rourke's Vanko, new ""assistant"" Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) and a more fleshed out Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson). While a movie like The Dark Knight was able to use its multitude of story lines to its advantage (with no small help to its longer running time), Iron Man 2 seems to have problems not too long after blasting through the starting gate.The multiple stories going on and weaving throughout the film are not bad, they just lack the interest and the drive the story at the heart of the original film had. At times, there is just so much going on that it becomes boring and feels like it is dragging the film out. I originally envisioned the added emphasis on S.H.I.E.L.D. and the first real push towards 2012's The Avengers would hinder the film, but at times, they are the most interesting things about it. Their mere mentions and initial origins feel more fleshed out, and more developed than half the ideas Theroux seems keen at throwing at the audience. They are the elements that stick, and despite having just come from the film, seem to be the only real integral things I can take from the film.Even worse is the character development. With the exception of Stark and Hammer, the rest of the cast gets very little time to really do much of anything. We get hints at how deadly an adversary Vanko is, but outside of a moderately thrilling sequence at a racetrack, we never really see how devastating he can be. Rushman is more of an enigma if anything, and seems to be here strictly to offer a tease for what may be a pivotal character in a later Marvel film. The chemistry between Potts and Stark is the only thing worthwhile thing Paltrow really gets to offer in the film, and Rhodes seems even more downplayed here than in the original film (even though Cheadle seems to be a much better fit for the character than Howard ever was). Spider-Man 3 had this same problem of adding too much to a good thing, so why did anyone think it would work out for the best here?But I digress. Downey Jr. was perfect the first time in the role as Stark, and looks even more at home in the role here. We really get to see the psychology and inner workings of the character more in this film, and Downey Jr. pulls it off with finesse over and over again. There are times where he looks like he should and wants to be doing more, but even at his most subdued, he is chewing up everything around him. He was born to play this role, and at no point does he ever seem to lose track of who the character is or how he should be played. At the same time, Rockwell knocks his role right out of the park. He plays Hammer with just the right amount of sleaze and sarcasm that he nearly steals the show in some sequences. He does great as the villain, and while some may be annoyed by his character, I could not get nearly enough.The effects are stellar across the board. I had heard some of them were not quite up to par, but I could not find any scene where I was not impressed by what was happening on screen. They are not perfect by any means, but the wow factor of the original film is still on display here. And thankfully, the extended ending battle scene for the most part more than makes up for the stilted and much too short battle from the original film's finale.Jon Favreau took a gamble on Iron Man and it paid off. For Iron Man 2, I think the gamble was a bit too much. I really enjoyed his extended performance as Happy Hogan, but the film just lacks the balance and the energy of the original film. There are some awesome sequences, and excellent performances from Downey Jr. and Rockwell. But as a cohesive whole, the film just feels like a bit of a disappointment. A decent disappointment, but a disappointment nonetheless.7/10.(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Click, Clack, Click, Clack, Click, Clack.","Loud migraine-inducing sequel which is made kind of like a two hour-plus music video with enough lights, cameras, and action to keep those with short attention spans happy for a few short moments. The movie takes off where its predecessor left off as Robert Downey, Jr. (in the titled role) has become a major international celebrity, but he has issues abound as the U.S. wants his weaponry for the obvious reasons. Meanwhile, arms producer/dealer Sam Rockwell and Russian recluse Mickey Rourke come into play as the antagonists. Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson make appearances to obviously set up ""Iron Man 3"" (I feel another major migraine coming on). And of course we have Gwyneth Paltrow (boring as usual as the love interest) and the usually dependable Don Cheadle (taking over for Terrence Howard who clearly knew better than to get caught in this franchise) who round out the main players in the all-star cast. Yes ""Iron Man"" makes a load of money at the box office, but critically there is not too much to talk about. Downey, Jr. seems content with playing the ham (think ""Tropic Thunder"" and ""Sherlock Holmes"") as his better work (""Chaplin"" and ""Good Night, and Good Luck."") seems a very distant memory. He has fun with the material and runs with it, in spite of the fact the substance is lacking in most cinematic areas. The screenplay is wishy-washy and Jon Favreau's (who also has a substantial acting role) direction does nothing to help in the end. Much like the original, this one is just a loud clunker that makes you root for the bad guys who keep up the intensity with their witty one-liners and tongue-in-cheek humor. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 2.  Must be the start of summer,"Jon Favreau is out to make a good comic-book summer popcorn movie with Iron Man 2, no more no less. Anyone expecting the super dark out of this film lime the Dark Knight need venture along to something else (for one, Nolan's own Inception, but that's not here nor there). We once again have Tony Stark, the man and self-made legend, who is unique among superheroes as he 'came-out' as it were at the end of the first film as being in fact Iron Man. He now has to deal with other things, such as the government wanting, telling, him to hand over his technology for defense (""I have just privatized world peace"" is a keeper of a line), and his heart and soul Pepper Potts, and other new things, such as prickly competition in Justin Hammer, a hot red-headed secretary who can kick ass (and other things)... oh, and his father's legacy and the possibility that his technology for his heart may kill him.So as you can imagine, Stark is not quite at the top of his game. He can still kick ass as Iron Man - when the suit is in close proximity - but his nearly-close-to-deathness and still cleaning up after Stark company mistakes (such as the gnarly Russian cold-war leftover Ivan, aka 'Whiplash', played with gnarly gumption by Mickey Rourke), make him even more of an egotistical jerk than usual. This is what Favreau makes interesting: Stark has grown over time, but the obstacles in his path really knock him for a loop despite always putting a slightly self-deprecating and sarcastic face on things (or, other times, drunk-off-his-ass face on things, which brings Rhodey to become a ""War Machine""). What does a hero have to do to still be an extravagant billionaire out in public and not have to suffer fools trying to crib his technology?Stark's complexity carries the dramatic weight (if sometimes not quite as much as before; the midpoint becomes a little sluggish, though certainly not unwatchable when Sam Jackson comes on screen as Nick Fury), and Downey Jr still makes him one of the most fascinating and just plain f***ing fun superheroes around. Tony Stark is someone you'd love to hate if he weren't such a lovable louse. He's a womanizer and doesn't put on airs, but he deeply cares more about things that do matter than most, and Downey is able to balance out that snark and sense of humor of things with more heartfelt moments like with Paltrow's Pepper Potts (watch those scenes where he offers her the CEO position and then near the end when... well, don't want to spoil that, but they are touching). The new additions to the cast help a bit as well: Rockwell has some fun playing a one 1/2 dimensional slimeball of a politico, and Rourke gets to grit and act gnarly with the best of them as Whiplash. And Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Romanoff... woof.Oh, and the action is still high-flying and exciting and has some surprises in store for the audience (others like the 'ex-wife' actually, pleasantly, underwhelm as irony), and Favreau is able to still manage getting in the humorous beats in those intense moments of action and daring-do. While not every joke hits or line connects, enough do to keep things going on; Favreau even has fun with himself in the Happy Hogan role in a fight scene that is just about perfect for him. The biggest problem though is the allusions - no, wait, flat out references - to the upcoming Avengers movie and other tie-ins to the Marvel universe. In the past it was a little more subtle (a SHIELD joke near the end of the first one, and a cameo of Stark in Incredible Hulk notwithstanding), and in this they are crowbared in a few scenes, albeit one involving Captain America is very funny.But look, this isn't Shakespeare, and it isn't necessarily trying to up the ante on the first one (though, frankly as one of the truly great comic-book adaptations, what could), but it kicks some ass and gets some laughs and assembles a top-shelf cast for a script that's worth the time and money and energy. It's a nice kick-start: the summer of 10 is here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Overstuffed,"Iron Man 2 is overstuffed, pulling in superfluous directions. It introduces Black Widow (and expands on SHIELD), War Machine, two villains, Stark's degrading health, his father issues, and expands on his complicated relationship with Potts. Had these plotlines been in separate movies, they could've had proper development. Instead, nothing intertwines and the movie is messy. Furthermore, Stark's character doesn't arc. He solves problems, but doesn't grow. In fact, he finishes the movie by mocking his doubters (even though they were right about his technology being a public safety threat). Ultimately, Iron Man 2 only feigns drama around merchandising and action.Technically, Iron Man 2 is a downgrade. Rock music is more sparse, imagery is less dramatic, editing is basic, sound lacks symbolism, and the tone is muddled. The first action sequence is appealing, but the climactic battle is uninspired. Meanwhile, the cast adds several big names, but there's less emotional range for them to explore. Previously, Downey was able to show vulnerabilities that are noticeably missing here. Overall, Iron Man 2 is more like a collection of parts than a cohesive whole. Its individual ideas are interesting, but it's too cluttered to connect. Iron Man 2 is fine entertainment, but it's also a missed opportunity.Writing: 4/10

Whip-Panned ?,"Call me a ""Thor - The Dark World"" apologist if you like, but for me, the worst film in the MCU is probably this slightly ill-fitting sequel to the one that started it all. I should say, that even though I do still think it's the worst film in the series, it's not actually all that bad, but it feels a long way away from where we'd be just a few years later.Having declared himself Iron Man to the world, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) faces criticism from his government that his suit is a weapon he wealds without oversight and should be handed over to the army. Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) has a vendetta against the Stark's since his father helped develop the initial arc reactor but was then disavowed and exiled. Creating his own arc reactor and powerful whip weapons, Vanko is narrowly defeated by Iron Man, but Stark's professional rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) sees an opportunity to one up his bitter competitor, he breaks him out of prison.Again, there is much setup in this film, Scarlett Johansson debuts as ""Natalie Rushman"" in a role that owes slightly more to ""the male gaze"" than I really remembered. Eventually though she suits up and we see something of what Black Widow would become. James Rhodes gets his suit. John Slattery takes over the role of Howard Stark, Garry Shandling makes the first of a couple of key appearances as Senator Stern. Kate Mara has a tiny role as a US Marshal which feels like it really ought to pay back into the MCU again somehow.The problem with the film is that it sags massively in the middle. Once the Monaco scene is over, it's almost entirely talking until the final fight, which is somehow both long and underwhelming, given how easily Ironman and War Machine despatch the drone army. I do like a lot of that talking, some of it, like the sitting in the doughnut bit has become iconic, but it's noticeable that my son (whose 10) struggled a lot more with this film than he did with the first one.Marvel's worst film is better than a lot of people could manage at their best, but it does feel like this was just a bit before Feige really nailed down the formula.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
BEST ADAPTATION EVER! Long live the new king!,"Well, it's happened again for the armored Avenger. It's no wonder that everyone is again praising Iron Man in some way. Iron Man 2 is the best comic adaptation movie ever made. The original Iron Man may have surpassed every original installment of any superhero film to date. Now, the sequel advances as well if not better than the previous great ""number 2's"" in history. Spider-Man 2, X2 and TDK all took the second films of the franchise to new heights. Iron Man 2 does the same and when you start at the remarkably high level that the first film achieved, that's saying something. It manages to deliver everything with the same style and integrity of the first film but adds more intensity and action. Again, like the original, Iron Man 2 is a film everyone can enjoy because it cares enough to deliver excellence on every front. The remarkable cast more than delivers and Cheadle was certainly an upgrade. The story itself is told in a masterful, crisp manner. It utilizes great dialogue that's witty, perfect use of humor yet again, advancement and complex characterization all the way through. Add the huge comic book style slugfests that were lacking from the first and you have what ten years from now people will be calling the best sequel of the decade. This is truly movie-making of the highest order and it easily deserves all the praise it has generated from both fans and critics alike. Long live the new king! What makes Iron Man a true rarity is that it's a fine film for kids but it's even greater if you're an intelligent adult.

Iron Man + extra charisma - Novelty - Initial charm = Iron Man 2,"Not difficult to guess the best part of the movie. Sometimes you feel that a particular role was destined to be played by a particular person. You can't separate the role and the person. Robert Downey, Jr. is Tony Stark. He is so convincing that if not for the backlash of the fans you may very well change the name of Tony Stark to Robert Downey, Jr. He is absolutely enjoying this role and it shows on the screen. Also Mickey Rourke is an excellent casting choice for Ivan Vanko / Whiplash. He is really cool. I read that it was Downey who initially proposed Rourke's name for Whiplash.Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts is good. But I thought the cheeky romance between Stark & Pepper in the first movie was not so great here. They could have improved the dialogue between them. Sam Rockwell plays Justin Hammer, the rival weapons manufacturer to Tony Stark. On one hand I was seeing Downey, Jr. absolutely enjoying his role but on the other hand I thought Rockwell was somehow not into the role and was somewhat disinterested. Rockwell is such a fantastic actor and especially after last year's Moon, I think it's time for the studios to make better use of him. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black widow is arresting as usual but her fight scene is the only action piece in the film that was rather boring to me. It was there to please Scarlett's fans but the makers should have taken more care about it and made it a tad more interesting. And Don Cheadle is brilliant in his role as Lt. Colonel James Rhodes / War Machine.The Iron Man was such a fun movie because it was novel and also there was a cute charm to it. Iron man 2 repeats it, so somewhere the novelty is lost and this is not as charming as the first part. Nevertheless Iron man 2 is a very engaging watch. All the action sequences are cool especially the piece on the race track. Once again, I hated Scarlett's fight sequence. When I saw all those drones at the climax, I was afraid for a while that this might turn out to be torture to ears like Transformers 2 but thank gosh there is not much metal clanking. The final showdown between Iron Man and Whiplash was surprisingly a low key affair, I mean they could have put a few seconds more there.All in all this is a really fun watch & you won't regret spending money on this.There is a special clip at the end of the credits which shows the discovery of Thor. If you didn't knew by now, check this on Youtube. For the fans of Thor, this would be thrilling.I'm seeing a full blown invasion of the screens by the Marvel characters in the coming years. With Thor coming in 2011 and Avengers probably in 2012, Marvel fans would be licking their lips. I don't know what else will be coming in the next 10 years. The coming decade could very well be a decade of superheroes if DC also joins the fray.I've actually got a crazy weird idea for a movie whereby Marvel heroes attack DC headquarters with the help of DC villains and in the sequel DC heroes attack Marvel headquarters with the help of Marvel villains. Just imagine Team 1: Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, Whiplash, Galactus, Dr. Doom vs Team 2: Spiderman, Ironman, Hulk, Lex Luthor, The Joker, Thor.

Great movie!!,"OK....so let me just start by saying, Iron Man 2 is AMAZING!! It's so good, it made me go unconscious for a little while....well almost. I read so many terrible reviews, so I walked in the theater a little skeptical. What I got was incredible though! It was everything I hoped for and nothing I was worried about it. ""Too many AC/DC songs"" and ""too much Burger King"" were 2 things I kept reading about, so I was kept thinking that it was going to be like a cheesy 2 hour music video/Super Bowl commercial. There were 2 AC/DC songs, which were only 30 second clips and fit the scenes they were in, plus I mean, directors like certain bands; just like Scorsese loves the Rolling Stones and puts tons of their tracks in his stuff, apparently Favreau likes AC/DC. Honestly, I didn't see Burger King anywhere in this movie and I can usually spot product placement instantly because it drives me crazy. It was great though is the bottom line. Even the change to Don Cheadle was fine and I loved first line of, ""I'm here, it's me, get over it,"" which obviously had a double-meaning. I loved all of it. Even Scarlett Johansson was good in it. She didn't have very many lines, so her inability to act well wasn't even noticeable, and she was a bad ass with bad ass fight scenes.I dug it, you'll dig it, go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I just don't know what was missing,"Something was particularly missing in this installment. I felt they used many characters that just weren't needed. For example, I just did not see the purpose of Johansson's character. The plot was well themed but it lacked direction at certain intervals. I kept on reminding myself that this is a comic book movie, this is a comic book movie...But so was Iron Man. The director tried too hard to make it good but in the end it just lacked a strong plot that made the first one so good. Also, the bull technology nonsense that they kept on talking about just made my head spin. So many plot holes, so many unnecessary scenes and characters. In the end, the director just created a summer blockbuster; in nowhere would this ever be considered a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Rhodey, get down!"" Nice movie.....","""Rhodey, get down!"" And with those words, a one-second effect, a secret Iron Man weapon that was so stunning and so unexpected and so well rendered, forced the audience to make a noise I'd never heard a group make before: A cross between a gasp for air and a Scooby Doo ""gewuhhhh???"". For a moment, the Chicago reviewers sitting shoulder to shoulder with laymen Q101 contest winners—they (we) were all children again.That moment was enough to make up for the Iron Man bathroom humor scene that—and I'm not making this up—serves as a primary conflict to drive the movie's plot forward.Still, it's basically impossible not to enjoy the film. Mickey Rourke, Sam Rockwell, Garry Shandling—these are what Iron Man 2 considers bad guys—a group of actors who are so entertaining unto their own right, it takes their unquenchable thirst for the blood of Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson to balance any semblance of screen karma.Once you're aware that's the tone—a shift from the oft-intense Iron Man 1—the little things, like completely disconnected setups for movies to come, glossed pseudo science and the most artificially extended protagonist romance since Dawson's Creek Season 4 won't get to you so much.The visual effects are sequelfied, too. Stark's Jarvis lab interface is celebrated to masturbatory limits (and I mean that in the best, best way), Whiplash's electric attacks are not quite like any other effect I've ever seen, the Iron Man briefcase transformation is still unbelievable after watching it about 20 times (I swear that 1/4 of the movie is dedicated merely to the setup of that moment—which is a completely valid use of screen time) and there are many robots Personally, I'd have preferred less of the fighting to take place from telephoto distances in the cover of night, but such is the case with larger scale fights—it's hard to frame an Iron Man centerfold when the guy is battling a small army rather than merely assembling his suit for the first time, tweaking thrusters while floating around his garage.But I'm using too many words. This is what you need to know: Iron Man 2 is not as good as the original Iron Man, but don't be so worried about some of those early, negative reviews—it's worlds, worlds, worlds better than Transformers 2, Spiderman 3 or some other franchise-devastating catastrophe. You'll still enjoy the movie a ton. Go see it already (opens midnight tonight in NY/LA/CHI, tomorrow everywhere else), just don't deconstruct it afterward.Also, Jon Favreau, I know you've taken some crap for your cameos, especially your personal extended fight scene. Don't listen to the haters. You gave us Iron Man, and if you like getting your ass kicked on camera, who are we to question that you've earned it. Also, the Swingers audio reference—you know the one—that was money",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Time to hang up your suit - IRON MAN,"This movie was everything that Iron Man 1 was not. Yes, it was terrible, predictable and irritating. I was so mad how they essentially didn't even show any super hero stuff for 90% of the movie. The children in the theater kept asking their mother's: ""Mommy, where is Iron Man? I thought this was Iron Man mommy?"". The mothers had to calm their children. It was so sad. What was even more irritating was how conceited Tony Stark was. I was kind of amused by how the senator kept harassing him. For 55% of the movie - Tony Stark was pompous and an ass. He was not even remotely amusing. Then of course there is the villain who was played by an obviously uninspired Mickey Roark hoping to cash in on the success of his hit The Wrestler. He basically had a horrible Russian accent and had LIGHT SABER BULL WHIPS as a weapon. This movie was terrible. I want to sue the makers of this movie for the two hours I wasted by watching it.

An okay sequel but with WAY too many subplots,"Iron Man 2 is just tolerable. I have just rewatched it recently but I don't hate it.Robert Downey Jr is the perfect Tony Stark but the plot is a bit too cluttered with Tony's problems and also his past.But it has great moments with the racetrack sequence, the fight between Rhodey and Iron Man in his house, Black Widow showing her fighting skills and also the chemistry between Rhodey and Stark during the finale.It's better than people give it credit for but it does have it's problems.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining but bland,"Score: 6.5.Note: I did not see the first movie, but I didn't think it was necessary.First, the good parts. Robert Downey Jr. does well playing Iron Man, a superhero who has various personal issues but yet isn't annoying. He's also supposed to be a physicist but unfortunately he seems unconvincing in this role. However, that's easy to dismiss as he rarely actually does any physics in this movie.The plot isn't very strong. Basically the military wants the Iron Man technology and there's also a nemesis that wants to destroy Iron Man and blow stuff up. Unfortunately none of the issues Stark faces here are particularly tense. This wouldn't be overly problematic if the action made up for it, but it doesn't.In fact, the action scenes mirror the social conflict in this movie. I never felt that Stark was in any danger in this movie. The longer action scenes were a bit painful because of this. I blame the lack of tension on the G rating of this movie (in some places it's PG-13), but it's on the lower end of PG-13. As a comparison to another superhero movie, Iron Man 2 is far tamer than 'Spiderman'.Perhaps the most painful part of the action was Scarlett Johansson, whose martial arts choreographed scenes were laughable, in a bad way. In fact, any fighting in this movie is essentially what you would find from a movie for little kids. Disappointing.The redeeming quality of this movie is some of the dialogue, which was humorous on many occasions, although silly at others. Hopefully the powers that be will realise that trying to make action appeal to such a wide age range is virtually impossible.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Much better than the first and just downright entertaining!,"This movie will definitely be one of the best movies (if not the best) I see in 2010. Robert Downey JR returns to do Tony Stark, better and funnier than ever! Tony Stark is enjoying life as himself and as being the famous Iron Man. A huge threat comes to his attention. A man with whips is trying to kill him! With the help of Don Cheadle as War Machine, the two of them try to bring a man who calls himself Whip Lash to justice! Mickey Rourke plays the part very well! It just goes to show you've never too old to be a badass villain! Scarlet Johanson plays a very hot, but very suspicious lady! The rest of the cast are good as well.My only complaint is the middle half of the movie goes abit too slow and drags on abit. I wont reveal why, but you will see what I mean when you watch it. And Iron Man does reveal how he goes to the bathroom while wearing the Iron Man suit! I'd give this movie a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A pretty poor sequel,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Iron Man"" 2 (2010) had a lot to live up to its great first part. It everything to be a great sequel, same director, more money and freedom, fresh and hot from his Oscar nomination performance Mickey Rourke but at the this movie failed. The reason is pretty all over the place writing of the story. I mean the story itself was OK, but not its writing. The pacing also suffered as they tried to show to many things at the same time.Overall, Iron Man 2 is the worst from its trilogy. It lacked everything that first movie had.

It just has an energy to it that can't quite be described in words!,"'IRON MAN 2': Five Stars (Out of Five)Like many second films in popular fantasy / action franchises (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK', 'THE DARK KNIGHT', 'SPIDER-MAN 2', 'ALIENS', 'TERMINATOR 2', 'X-MEN 2', etc.)'IRON MAN 2' takes what worked about the first film and totally ups the ante and creatively expands on the characters and drama of the first film to probably it's emotional and entertaining peak! It in many ways blows the first film out of the water. Although the action is a lot less frequent than you might expect, from a big superhero blockbuster extravaganza like this, when it does happen it's breathtaking; the race-car fight scene, which happens about a third of the way into the movie, is so cool it's mind-blowing and it's also emotionally intense (It's one of the raddest scenes I've ever seen in a movie and the rest of the movie never quite tops it; so the climax does happen pretty early on but that's OK, there's still plenty of quality movie left even so).What's best about the movie is not the action though it's the character drama and dialog; it would be a crime if this thing doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination for best screenplay, although I'm sure that's a crime that will most likely be committed (Robert Downey Jr. also unarguably deserves a nomination for his acting performance as well though). The movie is jam packed with some of the most witty clever dialog and interesting character development I've ever seen in a blockbuster like this! The whole thing is a very complicated psychological character exploration, all revolving around the most fascinating superhero character to ever hit the big screen; the eccentric somewhat mad genius that is Tony Stark (once again insanely but amazingly portrayed by Downey Jr.).The film centers around Stark's battles (not with bad guys and world threats, but) with health issues (he's being poisoned to death by the machine he created, in his chest, that initially saved him), alcoholism, a Government that wants to take control of his technology for what they say is the good of the country and his overall fight to keep his sanity dealing with all this stress. Throw in Sam Rockwell as an impressively portrayed billionaire tech rival and Mickey Rourke as a soft spoken madman bent on revenge against the Stark family, who he blames for stealing his father's ideas, and you've got a complete circus act of oddly interesting characters. There's also Don Cheadle cleverly taking over the role of Stark's best friend James Rhodes (although Terrence Howard in the first film was better), there's a little Samuel L. Jackson being cool like always and there's some more Jon Favreau (more than the first film) that adds some nice comedic touches. There is a very sexy Scarlett Johansson playing another super hero named 'Black Widow' but the female characters are a little underdeveloped compared to the men.You can tell it was written by a man (actor Justin Theroux who's only other writing credit is co-writing 'TROPIC THUNDER', another Downey Jr. scene stealer); the women dialog is mostly important plot advancement stuff but with the guys 80 percent of it could have been tossed and the plot would have been intact but it's just so natural and entertaining; like real people shooting the breeze! That's the brilliance of the film! Favreau has also come pretty far as a director; he's much more polished now and knows what's most important to the film. The whole movie just has an energy to it that can't quite be described in words.

"Good, but it's not nearly as good as the original","Jon Favreau has finally given us a sequel to the amazing super hero movie that was Iron Man. Tony Stark is back to give us more witty one liners, smashing action, and to sleep with all 12 Maxim cover models. Unfortunately, the sequel is beginning to show a few signs of what I like to call sci-fi syndrome. It has gotten a little bit too in love with itself, and as such is going too much in depth with side characters. In the first movie, Robert Downey Jr and Jeff Bridges dominated the screen time, showing off Gwyneth Paltrow on the side when it could, and this lead to a great feeling of the hero against the villain. In this sequel, Mickey Rourke did an amazing job in his character, was actually intimidating, and seemed completely cool, but he hardly had any screen time at all, so it was impossible to actually see him as a powerful villain to be feared. Jeff Bridge's character was clearly evil and a force to be reckoned with. This dilution of the villain and hero lead to this movie's fall from grace.Now, I do need to point out here that the movie was enjoyable. The action scenes were gripping, and the funny and cool lines were still there. It was just clearly inferior to the first movie, and therefore a letdown. The characters were weaker, and the acting from everyone except Robert and Mickey was a bit unpolished. The movie was still fun, and it was still worth seeing, but it wasn't anything great like the first would have lead us to believe this would be. Is it worth $10 down at the cinema? Maybe if you're really bored. But if you have a decent TV, maybe wait to get this one from Netflix and save yourself a few dollars. Overall, Iron Man 2 receives a 7/10 from me.This was a snippet from my full review. To see the full review, visit my site at http://docamos.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Possibly Better than Original!,"I went in the theaters with an open mind ready to expect the best and that is what I got. Iron Man 2 is just as good maybe even better than the first one. Robert Downey Jr is superb as Tony Stark once again. I also loved the performance by Mickey Rourke as Whiplash. I didn't expect much out of him. And of course we all know why Scarlett Johansson is here.This movie takes place right after Stark becomes public. He has to deal with the government who wants to take his suit and Whiplash who wants to kill him because of his father, Howard.I loved everything here. I enjoyed the action, the chicks, the cars, the special effects, and much more. The only thing I really hated was that Don Cheadle replaced Terrence Howard. I love Cheadle's acting but Howard was perfect in the first one.Overall, this is a fantastic sequel. I hope they make Iron man 3 and I can't wait until the Avengers in two years. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A fun watch but no Iron Man 1,"This movie has all the makings of an amazing superhero action movie in the league of The Dark Knight, Watchmen, and even the original Iron Man movie, but unfortunately it didn't live up to that expectation. Don't get me wrong, this movie was enjoyable start to finish but it didn't have the emotional punch of the other movies mentioned. Really there is no heart here, and never once does the movie require you to think.Without the great work of Robert Downey Jr. in the role he was meant to play, this would movie would lack charm as well. Iron Man 2 is close to two hours but seems to lose the time. Whiplash (Mickey Rourke), a truly great villain for Iron Man didn't have enough presence in the film. His final scene ended up feeling fairly corny.It's hard to express everything wrong with a movie like Iron Man 2 but there just wasn't any meat here. Gwyneth Paltrow who was terrific in the first Iron Man is only allowed to play one note here until the very end. She's the party pooper to Robert Downey Jr.'s perpetual party.Don Cheadle steps into Terrance Howard's shoes as Rhodey well enough but as with every relationship in this movie, the Cheadle and Downey Jr. story is underdeveloped. Scarlett Johansson plays Downey Jr's new assistant, hired on the spot. She adds some sex appeal to the cast, but again, it feels like we didn't see very much of her, and no bathing suit scene.The main problem I have with this movie is that we don't tread any new territory. It feels like this movie just had to be made because it was going to make a lot of money. I wanted an Iron Man 2, but one that was more engaging. Jon Favreau does all he can with the uninspiring script and plays ""Happy"", comic relief and a bright spot in the movie.In the end, this is a light, fun sequel that still leaves a lot to be desired. It seemed to be filler left on the cutting room floor from Iron Man 1. Iron Man 2 will not be selected for preservation in the National Film Registry, but it's going to make a lot of money. Probably pass the 400 million domestically and maybe even scratch close to the 1 billion mark worldwide.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Distracting blockbuster fare but lacks the spark and flow of the first film,"Although it was of course a summer blockbuster with all the flaws that came with it, I did really enjoy the first Iron Man film for what it did well. It was breezy, light and fun and it made it an easy film to like. I was hoping for more of the same from Iron Man 2 then and it is a little disappointing to find that it cannot quite replicate the same effect. Normally I would not be overly bothered by plotting in a summer action movie but for me this is sort of the problem with IM2. It is not that the plot is bad or complicated, it is just that it seems to lack a flow to it, meaning that it stutters along quite badly, robbing it of the light touch and sense of fun that the first film relied on.We have a Russian scientist out for revenge on the Stark corporation, Stark struggling with blood poisoning from his power source, Pepper Potts taking control of the company, Justin Hammer competing for military contracts, Stark refusing to share his technology with the US military (much to the chagrin of Rhodes) and Nick Fury continuing to try and recruit Stark to his Avengers initiative. In fairness the film is not as ""busy"" as it could have been with all these characters and aspects bumping around, but it does give it a rather messy feel and the film never feels comfortable until the final action sequence around the Expo. At this point there are goodies and baddies and everyone is pulling together in the same direction and it means nothing distracts and nothing breaks up the motion in the way that happens through most of the film.This is not the same as saying the film is bad, just that it doesn't quite have that fresh feel of the first film. Stark's excesses are overplayed to the point where he is a bit hard to like. The first film balanced this well (thanks to a great turn from Downey Jr) with his wit and character taking the load, but here the first part of the film gets a bit tiresome as Stark is in one glamorous location after another without much for the viewer to ""like"" about him. This turns around gradually but again never to the point of being as good as the first film. Downey Jr is still good though and he uses his laid-back charm to good effect when he gets the chance – it is not his fault that this film is ""busier"" than the first in terms of characters, so he has less time to spread out as he once did. Cheadle is OK but I would have preferred Howard in this role; the former just seems too hard and one-note here. Paltrow is amusing in her minor role while Johansson plays to her strengths by being firey in her hair and eyes while wearing a cat suit – nothing to say on her performance as an actress but she seems happy being a sexualised action figureen so who am I to question? Rockwell is great fun though. He plays well against Downey and he brings good humour to his parts. Rourke is a nonsense but an enjoyable one, he has a good presence and his character is at least interesting, which goes some way to making up for his rather silly costume. Favreau's appearance in front of costume doesn't do much as his comedy moments aren't that funny, while Jackson is determined to keep showing up in things being ""Samuel MF'ing Jackson"" over and over again. Shandling and Slattery are nice bits of casting.It isn't an actors' film though and it is mostly about the effects. The main CGI moments are great – free flowing, well delivered, quite exciting and technically impressive. Ironically some of the ""backdrop"" effects (like where the cast are clearly getting out of a car somewhere in the world other than where they appear to be) are pretty poor – not quite 1950's back projection but still they don't look real, although it is just a minor quibble.Overall Iron Man 2 is a reasonably enjoyable summer blockbuster. It has stars, it has noise, it has cheeky humour and all your money is up there on the screen to be enjoyed. Unfortunately for the franchise it has too much clutter in it that breaks up the flow of the film and makes it too heavy to feel as fresh and fun as the first Iron Man film. It will still please the target audience and it will work as a Friday night DVD but the studio's efforts to pull the Avengers together has actually hurt this specific film, making it less enjoyable than the first film by virtue of losing sight of what worked there by piling too much on top of it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Weak second installment in the MCU - part 1.,"It has all the things first Iron Man film didn't have. And that's not necessarily a good thing.Good : RDJ is fantastic as Iron Man and Tony Stark. He has proven himself to be perfect choice in the role in multiple films now, and this is no exception. No matter how ridiculous the screenplay was, he is the last thing wrong with this film. Also, we get introduced to two new characters, Nick Fury and Natasha Romanoff. Their introduction feels very apt for the first Avengers movie which came in 2012. Samuel Jackson and Scarlett Johansson prove to be the perfect choices in the first go. RDJ has a very great chemistry with all the cast members. His one liners are damn good. In the entertainment and performance level, there are no complaints.Mixed : Even though it was entertaining, it was a total mess. It had a ton of good ideas for a solo Iron Man film, but all of them do not coalesce together to form a solid plot of the film. The plotlines were good, but the final story did not turn out to be so good. I can appreciate what they tried but not what they did. It feels like a misfire. The arc they tried to give to Stark was quite good. But, the screenplay was ridiculous at many parts. We don't feel sorry, neither we sympathize him. Instead, he feels like a gigantic source of annoyance, even though he was to be sympathized.Bad : It feels like an advertisement for Avengers, rather than an entertaining build up. Studio allowing a very short period of time for making this movie is quite apparent. Whiplash feels as if he would've been a really great villain, but due to ridiculous screenplay, he feels uninteresting. He had motives to stand against Stark, but in the end he feels like a slimy goofball who wants to kill Iron Man to show that he is tough. And the other villain, Justin Hammer, is a blant rival of Iron Man who is a kind of a whiner and just a clichéd villain. I loved Terrence Howard as War Machine. Don Cheadle sucks. When Howard was casted, I felt like I would get a War Machine solo some day, or at least be in a really good role other than being a sidekick to Iron Man. But with Cheadle, I felt that it would be better if they make him just a sidekick and luckily, that's the case till date.Conclusion : It's an entertaining mess. You will enjoy RDJ and his one liners, and, the overall charisma that everyone, except Cheadle, bring to the characters they play. But if you expect it to be a solid sequel, it ain't so. Whiplash feels like a wasted villain and Mickie Rourke feels like a wasted talent. He did fine with the material he was given to work with, but it never felt like he was necessary for the role. But the biggest issue would be that it feels like an advertisement of Avengers rather than a build up, and the plotlines not meshing together makes it a disappointment to a certain extent.Rating.Score : 6.3/10Grade : B.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
***Out-of-this-world rocked!!!*** (http://themovimaven.posterous.com),"""I.privatize.world peace"" sums it all.The novelty of ""Iron Man"" hasn't worn off on me. While it would never be the same as witnessing the first scene of Iron Man soaring into space and the joy of the trial and error, Iron Man is still the only one of its kind that is as grounded in future reality as it could be.Tony Stark is one of the rare exceptions of being a publicly known superhero. And possessing the traits of a superhero, he does not. Robert Downey Jr. doesn't disappoint in the sequel wherein the world knows him not only as the billionaire weapon manufacturer extraordinaire, but more pivotally as The Man in armored suit.RDJ is the brain, heart and soul of Iron Man. It makes me wonder whether the script was written to be specifically tailored to him. Bold and brash, he's got that smug and swagger that commands the world over. Naturally narcissistic and sarcastic, over-sized just doesn't cover it as far as his ego goes. Never known for subtleties, his flashy style and fast-paced lifestyle suits him just fine - even in his quest to discover the new energy source since the arc-core machine that keeps his heart beating is also slowly poisoning his blood.RDJ's personality carries every single scene that he's in. Numerous outrageously riotous one-liners bring on continuous giggles and laugh out-louds. Be it frivolous or witty or sarcastic, Stark goes toe-to-toe with the newly minted CEO of Stark Industries aka love-interest Pepper Pots, newly appointed eye-candy secretary with an ulterior motive aka Black Widow, Hammer the competitor with an ambitiously ambiguous agenda, or Nick Fury from yes, the upcoming Avengers team (sidenote: the geeks in us would notice Captain America's shield and Thor's hammer). Everyone seems to have so much fun and it shows. I don't recall ever laughing so hard for so long in a non-comedic movie!And Whiplash... what an entrance! I totally didn't expect the Monaco mayhem to happen early. With connected past through their fathers, he's a worthy adversary. The Grand Prix thrill of the peril where Whiplash faces off with Stark sans suit is the stealer of the movie (and the manner in which he ends up donning the suit is a real treat), even more so than the last sequence of dash, smash and blast of the battle of the war machines in the end. Although the mass zig-zag laser cut or the armed superobots is the incredible icing on the metal. If there's a ""flaw"" in all these, Don Cheadle as war machine is too flawless to be believable. Not anyone clad in the suit is ""Iron Man.""One might argue that this ""Iron Man"" lacks heart, but I tend to think that it's just as it's supposed to be. ""Iron Man"" doesn't take itself seriously; it's a nonstop joyride starring a wisecracked eccentric atypical superhero, and it deftly delivers.The MovieMaven http://themoviemaven.posterous.com",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More 'Marvel Universe 0.5' than 'Iron Man 2',"Nowhere near as good as the first one, but enjoyable nonetheless. It's patchy and talky and Tony Stark spends much more time out of the suit than in it, but I still liked it. I can see why it's getting some poor reviews, it's all over the place with (too?) many characters and slows down in the middle. I think if you're not that familiar with the Marvel Universe you could find it confusing and maybe even boring. The thing I really enjoyed about this movie was that all the disparate events and characters go towards starting to define a cohesive movie version of the Marvel Universe. One of the things that has bugged me about superhero films in the past is that they try to occur in 'the real world'. The Hero is usually the only hero to exist, and only enough super-villains exist for the hero to vanquish in 2 hours. But these stories were never meant to work in the real world, they should be told within the context of a world of Marvels; a world of powers and magic, of super-spies and secret organisations, of advanced technology, miracle elements and mystical weapons. Iron Man 2 attempts this, but arguably at the expense of it's main character and a tight stand-alone script. The fan-boy in me likes the film for trying.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Too Smug For Its Own Good,"So Iron Man 1 was fun, mainly seeing a serious actor like Downey Jr having a go at comic book action. He was surrounded with quality support and provided a nice, out-of-his-comfort zone performance that made the film a little more than the average comic book effort.Downey Jr is back in this and again supported by a good cast. But this time he's too comfortable in the role and there's no real sense of involvement for the audience. Reminded me a little of the later Roger Moore Bond films.The support cast is fine, but like Downey Jr all pretty much one-note. Rourke has little to do and Rockwell is wasted. The women are a bit better, with Paltrow having a bit more to do and Johansson having fun.I'm sure this will be a success and sure that it will probably generate a third movie; I just hope that the next one is a little more interesting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A very enjoyable sequel,"With the surprise success of Iron Man in 2008 a sequel was bound to be made, with Marvel aiming to make the ultimate superhero film, The Avenges. Whilst a sequel was always a risk of never matching the quality of the original, but most superhero films then to buck the trend with the first sequel.Six months after the events of the first film Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has become even more of a star because of his success as Iron Man. He made Stark Industries into a more ethical company and appoints his assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) as his new CEO. But there is trouble on the horizon: the US Senate demand that Tony hands over his Iron Man suit, the palladium that in the arc reactor that keeps him alive is also poisoning his blood, killing him slowly. There is also a deadly threat from Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a Russian physicist who develops his own reactor and powerful suit so he can gain revenge against the Stark family. Vanko gets recruited by Tony's main rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) to make an army of suits so they can take down Iron Man. With Tony slowly dying his behaviour becomes more erratic and he slowly drives his friends away, with his best friend Lt. Colonel James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) to steal one his suits, allowing War Machine to be born.Iron Man 2 has many good and bad elements, mostly good. Jon Favreau continues in the director's chair and adds to his cast of talented actors. Of course Downey and Paltrow were great together and had excellent chemistry. It was a shame that Terrence Howard left as Rhodey but the filmmakers found a great replacement with Cheadle, an excellent actor with a role that increases in this film. Rourke and Rockwell both made great villains, particularly Rourke as the intelligence and powerful Vanko. It was a shame he did not have more screen time as he was a great as the bad guy and shows he was not just a one dimensional character. Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson were also good additions (yes I know Jackson was in the end-credits scenes in Iron Man). But they screen time was limited. Favreau improves as an action director with better actions scenes like in Monaco and the special effects were brilliant like in the last film. But the end fight scene could have been a little more epic. Favreau makes the tone of Iron Man 2 a little more serious then Iron Man was (which was not bad at all), but he keeps a strong scene of fun in the film and there is a lot of humour throughout. He knows how to deliver a blockbuster. Plus there are plenty of hints toward the upcoming Avengers film, which is great to see for all the comic-book geek within all of us.But Iron Man 2 is not as strong as Iron Man. The screenplay by Justin Theroux is sadly a little too unfocused and had too many subplots. Some elements do not fit as well in the film and makes it a little too long and some felt forced like Rhodey's falling out with Tony. It also suffers from having too villains, confusing the audience on who they should focus on. What made Iron Man was because it had a simple story. But this is minor and the screenplay is solid for the most part.A very enjoyable start to 2010's summer season.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Why no story?,"Not sure i understand why writers today, for Hollywood films, just cannot write (or perhaps get approval and money) for an actual good story? While the cast is immensely pleasing and the effects nearly perfect, there is just no story here. This inability of film-makers to actually produce these special effects films which also contain at least an interesting story is a great curiosity to me. If one were a student of Marvel comics, you might recall the many great stories that the writers made around their characters. There is a great emptiness, a gratuitous over- stated violence about this film that is sad, given the audience and potential for this film.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not a bad sequel..,Iron Man 2 has some similiar elements and plot devices to it predecessor. It isn't too drastically changed or amplified to its prequel and that's what I like about it.Solid story with some minor flaws. The beginning and ending were good but the middle was a bit slow and unnecessary. The characters were decent. The antagonist was a good villian and Tony has developed nicely so far. With good music and visuals and with good writing and directing it is definitely worth your time.Overall a semi enjoyable film.Memorable: No Rewatchable: Quiet unlikely..,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
On par sequel is iron clad entertainment,"Though I'm not a fan of Robert Downey, Jnr, credit to his choice of role in reprising the Iron Man character, this is a fantastic sequel to what was already shaping as a fresh and energetic franchise. Here he does battle against an eccentric Russian scientist Mickey Rourke (!), who's developed a competing manned drone with which his financial backer (Rockwell) hopes to overcome the Iron Man brand, flailing amid the deteriorating reputation of its creator whose rock-star lifestyle is waning on the authorities (a case of art imitating life to some extent).Paltrow and Cheadle reprise their roles, Paltrow now firmly in the frame as the brains behind the suit of brawn, whereas Cheadle, now without a suit of his own, is somewhat subdued by comparison. Clark Gregg once again makes for an amusing FBI agent, Scarlett Johanson is there as a double agent, and there are small roles for Garry Shandling, Kate Mara and John Slattery. Samuel L.Jackson pops in again to deliver mystical sermons on saving the world, becoming a better super hero etc.If you enjoy the sarcastic, dry-witted dialogue and the straight delivery combined with explosive special effects then this comic-strip film should appeal. It's just as good as the original (in my opinion) and though starting to become a little self indulgent in parts, isn't yet too self aware. Certainly the best of the current slew of comic book re-imaginings.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Enjoyable sequel,"After the events of the first movie, Tony Stark aka Iron-Man (Robert Downy Jr.) has revealed to himself to the world his true ID and he is making history. Ivan Vanko (Michael Rouke) avenges his father's death whom he believes his father's ideas were stolen by the starks years ago and decides to make himself a powerhouse named Whiplash. However, Tony is dealing with issues as the radiation in his pacemaker is slowly killing him as he needs a different kind of energy that can make him healthy for with the help of Pepper (Gynth Paltrow), Nick fury (Samuel L Jackson) and BlackWidow (Scarlett Johanson) as he faces an enemy far worse than his last one.An entertaining sequel to an excellent Marvel movie and probably the weakest of The Avengers set up movies as Jon Fevervue returns as director. This movie deals with conflict including decent character development and good acting but i do admit it is inferior to the first movie or The Avengers no doubt but there is some nice action sequences and good effects by ILM. However, i do admit it's a good sequel that also sets up for the next Avengers movie by the end credits.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I have a big soft spot for this movie.,"Perhaps it's because, unlike most MCU films, it feels like characters are just living in this universe. They're not driven by plot or action, they're just caught up in the obstacles that come with living in a world of superheroes, even if Marvel was clearly still trying to figure out what that world would be like.It's cool to see these characters just living their lives and dealing with their own personal problems while the villains deal with their own somewhere else. It makes for a somewhat uneventful story, but it sets it apart from other entries, both for better and worse.As I mentiones earlier, the MCU was still very undefined. The introduction of Nick Fury (as more than a cameo) and Black Widow isn't the first attempt to expand the world of the movie beyond its central hero (The Incredible Hulk had a Tony Stark cameo and the Super soilder serum played a big part in the plot), but it is the first time they had the main hero interact with this wider world, and while it's definitely not done as gracefuly as in later films, it does makes the universe feel lived in.Also, while I think that Scarlett Johansson is great as Black Widow (and that she's great here), she was definitely not as confident in the role as she would be in later films.Overall, it's a step down from the first one, but one that I still ejoy quite a lot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Just as good or maybe better than the first!,"You cannot always know what to expect in a sequel but I was blown away by how good this movie is. A perfect blend of a good story line, good acting, action and a touch of humor. Robert Downey Jr is even better in this film.I think after the first film he has just perfected the part of Tony Stark. Don Cheadle as Rhodey was brilliant. I originally did not know what to think when I heard Mickey Rourke would be playing the villain in Iron-Man 2, so i was really happy when he pulled of a stellar performance as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash. There were plenty of characters which is good to see in a film, many films have to little characters, but in this film there is many in Tony, Rhodey, Pepper, Nick Fury, Natasha, Whiplash and Justin Hammer. Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury was amazing but when you think about it what role doesn't Samuel L. play well.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
This is one fun feature,"Well billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has let the world know he is Iron Man. While this hasn't affected him, Tony has ""other"" matters getting his attention. The substance in the device that keeps him alive is slowly killing him, so he needs to find a new substance. Then the government/military wants to get their hands on the Iron Man technology, which Tony won't give up. Next Tony has to decide who will be the new CEO of Stark Industries if he dies.If this isn't enough to deal with, Russian criminal/inventor Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) is out for revenge on Tony because of something Tony's father Howard did to the Vanko family years ago, so Vanko becomes Whiplash and then teams up with fast talking, slick weapons designer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) who is also after any way to ruin Tony. So can life get any better than this!!!!So while we see Tony's life becoming a self-destructive mess, several people come into play to help him get back together if he wants help or not. They include Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), Lt. Col James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Don Cheadle), Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) who is in Stark's legal department, but has her own secret, and Col. Nick Fury (Sameuel L. Jackson) head of S.H.I.E.L.D.Overall I found ""Iron Man 2"" a very enjoyable escape from worrying about things. After most of the credits of rolled on the screen, we have ""one more scene"" before the Paramout logo appears. We are in New Mexico and the camera goes to a dig site where we see Thor's hammer.

Worth Watching,"After almost waiting for two years, we finally saw one of the most anticipated movies of 2010.To begin with, this movie fell short to be a masterpiece if compared to its predecessor. Back in 2008 'Iron Man' had amazed the critics as well as the movie buffs across the globe because of its sheer story and superlative action; thus raising the super hero genre movies to monumental heights. It was inherent for us to have high hopes of its next title.For those who are still having doubts on this, I would certainly urge everyone to watch this film in the big screen. 'Iron Man 2' practically starts after the events we saw in the first edition. Tony Stark's revelation of being 'Iron Man' has prompted the United States government for asking him to surrender the technology for better cause. Here Stark meets his new adversary Ivan Vanko a.k.a 'Whiplash' enacted by Mickey Rourke who seems to have a personal motive for seeking vengeance. Apart from this we are also shown some new developments in Stark's life which I wish not to disclose here.Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man had been the best choice made by director Jon Favreau; his charisma and acting talent had alone made the first movie such a success. Apart from some of the similar faces we have seen earlier, this time Don Cheadle as Lt. Colonel James Rhodes proved to be a worthy addition to the title. Personally I feel it would have been nice if Rourke's character was given some more attention because being the foremost antagonist of Iron Man his legacy seemed to be too short lived.'Iron Man 2' have concerted more on the drama elements than on the action possibly for making grounds for the future movie on 'The Avengers'. As an advisory note if anyone is planning to watch this movie only for its adrenaline pumped action then it might be little bit disappointing, as the sequel is not having much action so to say like its forerunner; however whatever action was there it was top notch and equally commendable.To finish with, this movie lives up to its expectation as I had said earlier, only I hope in its next title they balance the story with some more action. This is surly not to be missed in the theaters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bad.  Simply Bad.,"Okay, I am not a big comic book fan, nor do I know too much about ""Iron Man."" I am a big-time movie fan though, and there are certain things that a comic book movie (and basically ANY movie) needs to be successful.And they are: THRILLS... EXCITEMENT... SUSPENSE... STORY... ""Iron Man 2"" has none of them. How does a movie like this get released without them? ""Iron Man 2"" has no exciting plot for the hero to overcome to stop drastic consequences. No exciting action sequences to keep us on the edge of our seats. I don't know or really care how much this film keeps to the comic it was based on--if it doesn't have an involving, exciting story, it fails.All of the actors, Downey, Johannsen, Favreau, Rourke, Cheadle, give mediocre, forgettable performances. All of them are good actors who I have enjoyed watching in other films, but seem to just be trying to be cool, hip, and clever in front of the camera this time.This film should have reminded me of the ""Batman,"" ""Superman,"" or ""Spiderman,"" films, but it has more in common with the ""Ocean's 11"" movies: a bunch of big stars hamming it up, trying to be ""cool,"" and having fun in front of the camera, instead of trying to make a good movie.What does Mickey Rourke's villain want in this film? How will it affect the world if he achieves his aims? Why should we care if he succeeds? Why are there no moments when Iron Man seems on the verge of losing everything? This film is an example of letting success go to the producers' and actors' heads. Hopefully the fan-boys will realize and admit it stinks before more action and comic book films turn out as dull as this one.Grade: D",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Robert Downey Jr.,"At first sigh, it is not exactly the expected part of series. because something missing. but the lead sin - a not realistic accent to the vulnerability of Tony Stark is saved by the genius of Robert Downey Jr., giving one of the most credible and nice character from Marvel universe. another good points - Don Cheadle as Lt. Rhodes, Scarlett Johansson as Romanoff and, sure, Mickey Rourke as a vilain who impresse more for its past story and for a sort of old fashion ambiguity. short, a nice film for not the fans of Marvel industry.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Still better then the first,"Well this movie just starts out strong it pulls you in and you will enjoy the ride. Robert Downey Jr. is phenomenal this guy is right for the part. This movie will make you laugh and you will get to see some cool explosions. But then the movie slows down in the middle almost to a stop. It almost makes you mad because you were loving this movie then all a sudden it comes to this screeching halt. The movie will pick up towards the end but if you're like me and like the main hero take on the main villain fights that they have in every other superhero movie then the end fight will make you just be annoyed with this film and leave you with this ""wow that was lame"" feeling. If you like movies with fights and explosions then sure see it. If you are a comic nerd then at all cost avoid this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

There are also a couple of obvious links in the film to other films.The cast is amazing I though that Don Cheadle as Rhodey would be a let down but in my eyes he is an upgrade, he really hits the floor running. All the cast are amazing and Mickey Rourke makes an awesome Russian, he really brings his character to life.Basically defiantly go watch it and see for your self, but if u like the first one or anything marvel you will LOVE it!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good for the genre,"It's a pleasant surprise, to see that a blockbuster's sequel can be also made in a honorable way. The first ""Iron Man"" was in itself a pretty good movie in the superhero genre - and the second one stands true to the trend. The conflictual premises of the protagonist are correctly structured, and the general setup, with the political and global background, is way better than in many of the other similar movies.It's true that the antagonist, played by Mickey Rourke, is somewhat sketchy and short-spanned - but the good news is that the character leads to a valid final confrontation, that also deserves laurels for the smart and resourceful ways of combining all the elements - the hacking angle being the most generous of all. Unfortunately, less can be said about Hammer, an improbable caricature, and about the simplistic satire around the politicians. The target is the right one, but the means to touch it, too cheap.The photography and the visual effects, of course, are commendable, although the narrative rhythm might be lacking here and there, mainly in the first third of the story - more precisely, up to the Monaco incident, that is masterfully shot. All in all, it delivers, so it would be unfair to demand more. Good thing that the superhero action movie are also able to offer great entertainment - at least, from time to time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a disappointment,"The first installment with Downey is one of my all time favorite movies. Iron Man 2 fell flat. Too much talk, not enough action. Don Cheadle's performance was weak as usual. Terrence Howard is a far better actor. All the actors seemed to be just going through the motions. Weak story line. What's with this Ivan Vanko character? Some sort of mishmash of villains from the novels and a weak villain at that. Weak enemy robots. All they seem to be able to do is salute and get blown up! Weak nemesis in Justin Hammer. At least Scarlett Johansson was nice to look at. Weak final battle. The movie is just plain weak. We need Super Heroes not comedians! Batman still rules!",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Pretty good the second time around.,"Rating: *** out of 4.If the first IRON MAN was the origin story, than naturally its sequel would throw in the consequences. That doesn't make it a better film; in fact it's too much of it actually. But with the right balance of humor, thrills, special effects gimmicks, and more of Robert Downey Jr. as the narcissistic Stark, IRON MAN 2 is an adequate follow-up, even if it goes wildly out of control as it makes like SPIDER-MAN 3 and throws in as many subplots than it can handle.But unlike the latter, director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux (TROPIC THUNDER) keeps things better in balance and some of the sub-stories don't come quite as pointless as the one's in SPIDER-MAN 3. Still, if your gonna put Mickey Rourke as a cool bad guy named Ivan Vanko, you might as well give him better use than a filler for the grand finale. Vanko is the son of a disgraced Russian physicist who once collaborated with Tony Stark's father. Now, Vank demands revenge to lift his father's legacy. But the movie seems more interested in Stark's own problems with his life as mankind savior. A US senator (played hilariously by Garry Shandling) argues that Stark should hand over his technology to the US Military. Stark declines, taking him one step further to competitor Justin Hammer, who has tried endlessly to apply his own technological breakthroughs akin to Stark's and failing miserably. He now recruited Vanko, who failed in his first attempt to assassinate Stark, to build him a new breakthrough that would rival Stark and shame him in his own ""Stark Expo"" - Stark's annual unfoldment of his latest inventions. This gives more time for Rourke to play Ivan, not as a kick-ass bad guy, but as a comic relief spending time conversing with his pet Cockatoo. There's yet more plot: Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) gets a promotion as new CEO of Stark Industries, she gets a new assistant named Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson) who's really more than who she is. Plus Stark is being considered to be a part of the Avengers Initiative by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson, who extends his after-credit cameo in the first as a full-time role), and Stark's buddy Lt. Col. ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (now played by Don Cheadle) gets his hands on one Stark's earlier Iron Man suit that gets a few modifications. Did I miss anything? Is IRON MAN 2 a crowded movie? Yes. It's not only over-plotted, it's cast reads like a who's who of who would people want to see in the latest Hollywood blockbuster (You want Scarlett Johannson in a tight rubber suit kicking butt? You got it!). But hey! In the heat of summer time, boredom can easily be cured by some explosive blockbuster fun, and IRON MAN 2 works fine.It's not as great as the first (which I never thought of as great as others think), and too much of it is a bid distracting (Stark is still front-and-center, but sometimes they tend to put him aside, then bring him back, and set him aside again), but it's a certified fun movie on a boring day.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not bad, for a human","IRON MAN 2 is a surprisingly decent sequel and a definite improvement over the silly, convoluted and somewhat childish original. Try as I might, I could never get into the first film's storyline involving a supremely arrogant Robert Downey Jr. and a ""what's he doing here?"" Jeff Bridges. The effects were unremarkable and the story bogged down in the ""origins"" nonsense that made it a chore to sit through.This sequel gets into full stride straight away and explores what it's like to bear the weight of responsibility. Stark is by now an alcoholic who ends up alienating most people around him, and I just found the whole thing more involving and engaging. There isn't an overwhelming about of action, which is great, because the two set-pieces that do occur (the race track showdown and the extensive climax) are all the better for it.Downey Jr. remains a bullish and unlikeable character, but there are more interesting supporting roles here for Don Cheadle and, in particular, Mickey Rourke, who's enjoying something of a career renaissance as of late and who has a ball as the crazed, whip-wielding bad guy (and I absolutely LOVE those whips!). It's not perfect, because Gwyneth Paltrow is still a drippy irritant and director Jon Favreau needs to learn humility after casting himself in a supposed comedic part, but the presence of special agents Samuel Jackson and, in particular, Scarlett Johansson, add to the entertainment value immeasurably. I just we could have had more Kate Mara...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Sequel, though not as bad as it could have been","My least favourite Iron Man film, and for a good reason. Whereas the first Iron Man film was a great origins film, this film had the burden of answering the question ""then what?"". And it drops the ball, completely.Well, okay, perhaps that's not exactly fair. It's not a bad film, no sir. For one, the villain (played by Mickey Rourke) is very good. Rourke is a great actor, though he has a tendency to always play the exact some role of a grizzly badass, and that doesn't change, but he always throws in a little variety to keep it interesting. Ivan Vanko in this film always has this look on his face, like he's internally grinning at you, because you fail to impress him. A man always in charge, even while in chains, frighteningly brilliant and at times even unstoppable. In short, an excellent villain.Furthermore, Robert Downey Jr. is still an amazing Tony Stark. His few opening scenes are pure gold, especially the hearing, and when he acts out the vulnerability of the character, I believe it. The problem here isn't the acting, it's the writing. I've enjoyed the fact that Tony Stark always fights villains that he has created himself. Likewise in this case, which is fine, but otherwise they took a huge step backwards with the character of Tony. And this is a common sequel mistake where the main character seems to have learned nothing from the events of the first film. Tony Stark in this film seems to recess back to that egoistical jerk that we saw at the beginning of the first film. Granted, they at least try to justify it by pointing out that Tony is the sort of man to do things like that, but it still feels wrong somehow. We expected more from you, Tony.And it doesn't help that the film tries to force in a subplot about Tony's dead father and all the usual clichés that go along with that storyline. It's tedious, it's boring, it's not needed and the film really should have focused on the villain and the newly-found responsibilities of being a superhero maintaining world peace. Not this unconvincing emotional busywork.This film has its ups and downs. I love the action, the visuals and the music. I like the villain very much and I like the returning actors. But the story just isn't that strong and the film lacks focus. If you're a fan of the superhero genre and you liked the first film, you're not going to hate this one. It's not great, like the original, but it's decent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I Think Not!!!,"The old saying goes that when people retire, they don't come back head strong. I disapprove very strongly whoever said that.

I'm talking about Robert Downey, Jr. He may have had a rough beginning, but he has shown his true colors, especially the gold and the red colors. Now that they have added a third to make it a trilogy, I can't wait to see that one. I didn't think I would like Iron Man, but I do – here's what I think and believe about this, I think we are going to see Downey, Jr. more and more and more. Great acting, wonderful cast (Downey, Jr., Paltrow, Rourke, Cheadle, Rockwell, Johansson, Jackson) and a wonderful director who by the way made a cameo in the second.

Rust never sleeps,"Another flash-bang-wallop of a Marvel feature in the now continuing saga of Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man, this is equally as exhilarating as its predecessor. The suit is still the star for me, my main objection being that old metal-head's screen-time is reduced greatly by the increasing focus on the troubled Tony Stark, who besides a worsening poisoned-blood situation (caused by his palladium-based artificial heart) which threatens to kill him, suffers rock-star excess, over-drinking, the approbation of colleagues and lovers, the chiding of S.H.I.E.L.D recruiting officer Nick Fury, disputes with a confrontational congressman, continuing rivalry with smooth operating megalomaniac Justin Hammer, oh and daddy didn't love him either - all of that before Mickey Rourke's Whiplash enters the scene.So, quite a lot going on then, which with so much character development, gives the likes of Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and Sam Rockwell (the latter, the real show-stealer here) the chance to act and interact, although Don Cheadle seems very ill at ease as pressed-into-action hero-or-villain War Machine and Rourke gets to mumble and mutter a lot in a heavy Russian accent. Scarlett Johanssen, provides energy and sexiness as martial arts expert Black Widow, obviously laying down a marker for the Avengers movie to come.The action sequences are a little hit and miss for me, the first fight between Iron Man and Whiplash being the most memorable, but the later flight / fight with Whiplash's drones is all just lights in the sky and the final reckoning with Whiplash over and done with too quickly.Punctuated by a mainly heavy-metal (geddit?) soundtrack, this is one film you won't be easily able to ignore. How long it actually lives in the memory is a different matter entirely, sort of like reading a comic-book I guess.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Expcept he has a reason to be resentful of Tony Stark and I liked this twist that the supposed bad guy actually had a real moral reason to fight the hero.

decent second installment though not as interesting as the first one,"Iron Man 2 didn't degenerate all all into an episode of Transformers 3, but the ones expecting a story as enjoyable as the original will be a bit disappointed. This follow-up to the 2008 success has some problems with the plot, I'm not saying it's a bad movie but certainly worse than its prequel. There are a lot of scenarios but none of them explaining what's really happening. Furthermore the action scenes we have aren't excellent at all, the storytelling is amusing and entertaining, acting performances up to the situation as well but the whole product is less convincing than Iron Man 1.

My review of The Avengers....I mean Iron Man 2,"Now I'm all for movies being loyal to their origins (in this case the original Marvel comics), but at some point, there has to be a little bit more of the ""human elements"" that create the fine line between the two in this film. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is the ego driven technology typhoon, whose cocky humor gets annoying at times, has a problem. His power supply is running low and he is slowly dying. This film takes a more serious look into what Iron Man is truly composed of, but unfortunately the characters don't seem to understand the situation as much as we do. If Tony Stark cannot take himself seriously, then why should we as an audience?Wipelash (Mickey Rourke), Iron Man's new enemy in this film, is a very dark, interesting character. Sadly though, is given about 15-20 minutes of screen time, majority of which he is either building something or hacking computers. Even his on screen presence is often interrupted by the annoying and uninteresting Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). His actual action scenes where he is actual causing destruction may total 3 minutes.Iron Man and Whiplash share a minuscule amount of time on screen together. They meet near the beginning and again near the end. Everything that the two characters were doing in between were totally unrelated to the other (This may be the one part of the film that actually frustrated me).Later in the film, Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) discusses Iron Man's health with Stark. Now for a fan of the Avenger series (like myself), you would probably recognize him, but for anyone else, you wouldn't have a clue what his relevance is. Same goes to Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) her appearance seems to build slowly up to one scene where she beats up like 10 guys.Much of the film I felt like I was watching an extended trailer for The Avengers. Another portion was like I was watching an Audi commercial. Another portion was like watching a married couple bicker at each other (Pepper Pots (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Tony Stark showed no chemistry at all). Many scenes were so unrelated, I don't know how they weren't cut out. The small portion remaining was what I had hoped much of the film was about, more action, and less boring, totally random dialogue.Overall this film is no doubt a ""filler film"". It's just a tiny piece of the big picture that Marvel is working towards. It's one thing to hype a movie with news and trailers and other things.

The film is deeper in the story, the characters are as funny and charming as ever with the edition of some new characters, and action to keep you happy and satisfied through-out the entire film.In this film we see how Tony Stark is now a big celebrity and has helped bring what seems to be world peace. However, he has enemies on the move and are going to try and show the world that even Iron Man can bleed. So now with time running out and new mysteries about his own past to solve, Tony has a lot to do for this exciting follow-up to the 2008 blockbuster.The film has everything the average summer movie-goer wants to see in a film, great action, beautiful special effects, well-written script, and characters that you just have to love. Iron Man 2 in my opinion is better than the first and is probably one of the best superhero films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
How much cheaper it could have been without the first 90 minutes,"The surprising thing about the initial movie release of Iron Man was that not only was there action, but thought and intrigue. There was almost something in the movie for everyone simply because wading through the scenes you didn't find interesting were blocked well and didn't run on and get you impatient. Not so with this new entry. I was hoping that it would have gone more the way Spider Man II went: More plot for morons, more build to romance, enough head on action to appease the geek. This for me did not happen. Now granted, I don't claim to be an expert in movies. I don't know the intimate histories of all the stars and starlets out there, or the screen writers, nor the directors or producers much more than the average Joe but I'm not all that willing to accept less than what was offered in a preceding film. Even though the same constellation was involved with this production it just didn't quite do it for me. I was disappointed. Here's why: The first 90 minutes of this film were vague and uninvolved. You may argue the fact, but to this reviewer it seemed that the entire movie was during the last 30 minutes when good versus evil clashed in a way we hope it would. I have seen it twice, and the second viewing confirmed what I couldn't pinpoint in my first watch: The movie was boring for the most part. Nick Fury was a ""meh"" (though Jackson still is just right for this part); Scarlett at her best was image happy. The whole sequence with her kicking her way through the Hammer corporation I couldn't decide was her stand in, or CGI, or just the actress. I saw this in a DLP theater and the way her hair flew around the screen just didn't look justifiable (even though the leather suit did justice to her makeover); Pepper seemed almost borderline personality disorder - mood-swings were almost menopausal. Even the Iron Man seemed a little over the top even at his worst. The one thing that was almost perfect was Rourke's portrayal of Ivan. He is the perfect ugly bad guy as we have come to expect since his role in Sin City. For the most part to me, the whole thing seemed like it was over acted. Hence, when action commenced, it all seemed to fall in place. Still, there are redeeming graces that occur. The filming and coloration are up to par, the enhanced Iron Man effects appreciated. Thanks to CGI, it was still a great theater experience. I don't know how it will fare on DVD. I think over the coming weeks, the viewing of this movie will drop significantly from opening day, just the opposite of ""How To Train Your Dragon"", which is doing really well still. It's not that this movie was a total waste, it is just expectations were not met in this reviewers opinion. Sorry guys.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Good follow up, good characters, good fun","First of, make sure you stay after the credits, again. Second, this seems to be a very wordy film.Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke have great dialogue and Don Cheadle replacing Terrance Howard is on form too, you get great action and great performances from all, a very good second film, but one more and that is it, at least you can see what is going on, unlike Transformers.You often wonder how they can do a next film after the first Iron Man was so good, well at least they handled the two main villains a lot better than I expected. Action is much harder than the last one, so try and get a digital showing, I saw at Vue in London on the 29 of April, so the crowd was small, no kids.An interesting super hero film, wait for third film to compare them all.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fantastic movie!,"Sometimes, Hollywood fails in making a sequel that's just as good or better than an original film: not so with Iron Man 2! This movie is a complete success from the very beginning, containing exciting action scenes, invoking concern from us viewers, and making us laugh. The roles were well acted by everybody. Robert Downey Jr is an on screen delight...his method of acting is so much fun to watch. He has a charisma that many actors of today seriously lack. He took on the role of Tony Stark as if he was truly that man. He had perfect chemistry with everyone, and I was sorry to see the movie end. I haven't seen many of RDJ's older movies, but as far as I'm concerned, I plan to see everything he makes from now on!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"not as fine as the original, but entertaining enough","As ""Iron Man 2"" opens, Tony Stark, the wunderkind head of Stark Industries, has just revealed to the world at large that it is indeed he lurking inside the metallic suit of the planet's latest crime-fighting superhero. But such a public admission comes with a steep price. For now the United States government wants him to register himself as a deadly weapon; a rival defense contractor (Sam Rockwell) is determined to beat Stark at his own game by creating his own army of iron-clad warriors; and an arch-nemesis (Mickey Rourke) from the former Soviet Union has suddenly appeared on the scene in his own superhero getup to destroy Stark in a mano-a-mano battle on the streets of Monaco.As a piece of pure Saturday-matinée popcorn entertainment, ""Iron Man 2,"" directed by Jon Favreau, is, perhaps predictably, a notch or two below its dazzling 2008 predecessor. However, the sequel still has enough quality elements – most of them holdovers from the first film – to recommend seeing it: namely, Robert Downey Jr. as the wisecracking, hard-living but lovable boy genius, Stark; Gwyneth Paltrow as his endearing personal assistant, now CEO of Stark Industries, Pepper Potts; and enough funny one-liners to take the edge off of some – though not all - of the script's numerous plot contrivances. As with the previous film, Downey Jr. and Paltrow achieve a wonderful love/hate chemistry between them, and the cast has been expanded to include Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson (who had an uncredited role in the first one), and Kate Mara as well.The screenplay by Justin Theroux makes at least one right choice by having Stark becoming ever more gravely ill as a result of the chemical he has to keep pumping into his chest to survive in his semi-cybernetic condition. This has the effect of humanizing the character, making him destructible and vulnerable and, thus, someone whose fate we can come to care deeply about. And, needless to say, Downey Jr.'s smart, savvy performance is equally instrumental in helping us to connect with the character.The special effects and actions scenes are impressive, of course, but it is Downey Jr. and Paltrow who once again make the movie soar.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I was ready to love this film...,"About three days before I went to see ""Iron Man 2"", I watched the original ""Iron Man"" for the second time. This time, my 20 year-old watched it with me. She'd never seen it before and loved it--thanking me for recommending it to her. And, considering that I not only saw the film twice (that's very rare for me) and gave it a 9 in my review, I obviously was stoked to see the sequel. Too bad I was so underwhelmed by it.While my daughter said she also liked this film and said Tony Stark (Rober Downey, Jr.) was a jerk like he was in the comic books, I though he was simply a jerk--and perhaps my not reading the comic book made it harder for me to take this bothersome portrayal. Now I am NOT saying I expected him to be perfect--after all, in the first film he was truly irresponsible and sarcastic. But, in ""Iron Man 2"", you also liked him despite, or perhaps because of these flaws! In this sequel, that likable roguish quality was missing...he was simply an annoying and self-indulgent jerk. Now my perception is not everyone's, I know. Perhaps it's because I am 46 (a bit old for this sort of film) and because I haven't read a comic book in 35 years. Whatever the reason, I found it hard to love the film when I disliked the leading man so much. Heck, while he was very one-dimensional, it was often easier to like the baddie (Mickey Rourke)!! At least he had some sense of purpose in life other than his own misguided narcissism.My other serious problem with the film is the over-reliance on special effects. Too often, the film simply overloaded my senses--as it seemed bent on topping the eye-popping images of the first film. And, while it did this clearly, it did so at the expense of the plot and, more importantly, character development. As a result, I just can't see this film as anything more than eye-candy for the very easily amused and not a film with any serious depth--something that was NOT a problem with ""Iron Man"". Watch it if you want...just don't expect a lot of magic.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man Shows Rusts,"Robert Downey Jr. returns as billionaire weapons designer/superhero/stand-up comedian Tony Stark. Unwilling to mass-produce his Iron Man suit, the race is on to replicate it. Justin Hammer played (Sam Rockwell) is the Bill Gates to Tony's Steve Jobs, evidenced by the stress on their competing arms expos. When Stark's showboating at a racetrack leads to a curiously well-timed showdown with a mysterious Russian named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), Hammer sees an opportunity to fund a project to surpass Tony's and win a lucrative military contract. Ivan has other ideas in mind, wanting to make Tony pay for the betrayal his father was dealt. Can Tony stop them? Will Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) finally accuse him of sexual harassment?Truth be told there are some funny lines and a couple of quality moments of comic book style action. There's also a ton of falsified marketing. Iron Man 2 is going to get your hopes up, then disappoint you with a ridiculous subplot. There is a tremendous lull in the action because Tony is forced to discover a cure for a blood-polluting toxin found in his arch reactor. It's not terribly interesting and it's brought in for what I like to call the ""Batman Effect"": the altering of a hero's costume for the purpose of merchandising.I know the first movie wasn't action heavy. It was the origin story explaining how Tony Stark became Iron Man and it was filled with witty jokes and banter between Tony and his secretary Pepper. Well for some reason it was decided to take out those sincere moments and throw in interloping arguments. Many conversations in Iron Man 2 can't be recalled because they consist of characters talking over one another.Don Cheadle has replaced Terrence Howard as Stark's go-to guy Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes. Though Rhodes physically does more in this sequel, he seems to have less face time because Tony needs to talk to just about everyone else in the world. Now Tony is to meeting with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who you may not remember if you left Iron Man prior to the completion of the credits. Scarlett Johansson is brought on board for a role that equates to eye candy. Rather than see her emote like an android, I'd prefer some more time with Stark's robots. In the original, Stark's lab was a fun set where he tinkered with his suit while being assisted by his inventions. It was Frankenstein meets Pee-wee's Playhouse and it was one of the many strong points of Iron Man. I suppose that since he has his suit now he doesn't need to spend time in the lab, but the subplot that has him making adjustments is a tough pill to swallow. It's not unreasonable to say that his arch reactor is poisoning his blood, sure it's not a story line worth spending half the film on, but it's not unreasonable.Then Rhodes willingly, and stupidly, betrays his better judgment. I understand that there is a plan in place to make Rhodes into the hero known off-camera as War Machine, it just bothers me that they would take the already powerful Iron Man suit and find it necessary to add a minigun. I'm sure if they used some thought, someone could have found a more reasonable method to create the character.By this time, I'm not certain that anyone actually directed this movie. These Marvel sequels look so much alike and play the same numbers for an encore, it's movie making by committee. Some scenes really could have been trimmed down, take the protracted Senate hearing for example. Action scenes were few for comic book hero film with it's protagonist in his post-origin stage. In the first film Tony was a charismatic guy who was bit of a jerk but made up for it with redeeming actions and humor, ultimately changing his character over the course of the film. In Iron Man 2, he's taken a step back in all regards as though Iron Man rusts. In fact, the only good laughs I found in the film came from the timing of Sam Rockwell. There's even a S.H.I.E.L.D agent whose sole purpose makes him the harbinger of movie titles. Since when was it considered okay to load a feature length film with promos? These are not decisions made with the guidance of an ""artistic vision"".Iron Man 2 isn't the worst sequel from Marvel (I think Spider-Man 3 will carry that moniker till the day I'm placed in the cryogenic chamber). At its best you will be entertained by parts and not offended by the rest. It's not terribly juvenile, nor is it loaded with kitsch. The saving grace of this par treatment is its cast, who put in as much effort as the licensing factory will allow minus Scarlett.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Tony Stark is Back!,"The world is aware that billionaire inventor Tony Stark is the armored super hero, Iron Man. Under pressure from the government, the press and the public to share his technology with the military, Tony is unwilling to divulge the secrets behind the Iron Man armor because he fears the information will slip into the wrong hands. With Pepper Potts and James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes at his side, Tony forges new alliances and confronts powerful new forces.It's been about two years since the last IRON MAN film and now, the sequel officially starts off the summer on a disappointing note. Like many sequels, IM2 fails to live up to the original, yet it isn't an entirely bad film. It's just very disheartening to see so many flaws in a film in which the original film was so great.The main flaw of the film is, you guessed it, the story structure. When the film gets to the second act, the film gets into the convoluted territory. There were like five plot lines going all at once, most of which were even unnecessary. It was just a mess and I didn't believe some of the characters' actions. The characters Pepper Potts and Lt. Rhodes seem to be against Tony Stark just for the sake of giving him more problems to resolve.Another problem is the underused actors since there are so many characters, including Mickey Rourke. Rourke could have been a pretty cool interesting villain if he would have more screen time, but he ended up being a generic villain. Sam Rockwell is another new cast member who I didn't seem to care about. Robert Downey Jr. is great in his suitable role as always along with Gwyneth Paltrow. I thought Scarlett Johansson was pretty sexy with her bad ass fighting moves, and Don Cheadle doesn't disappoint.The film also suffers from the role of what SHIELD has over this film. There's just too many references and characters that appear here just to remind the audience that Tony Stark will be in an Avengers movie. However, saying that, the film does have some pretty fantastic action sequences, although there aren't many. One cool scene was in the climax, which was explosive and kinetic.Overall, there isn't much to say about this sequel. The first act and climax are good, but the second act is just a convoluted mess. However, as a summer popcorn flick, it's entertaining while it lasts but is immediately forgettable after the credits roll. But let's be honest. Every one is going to watch this movie regardless of what other people have to say. It's just THE movie to see this summer so I'll just say stay after the credits to see one extra scene. Enjoy it for what it is and nothing more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Fun, fast and action packed!","The original Iron Man is obviously a hard act to follow; but surprisingly Iron Man 2, just about pulls it off! It revolves around the star ego of Tony Stark, playboy millionaire by day, action hero by night; although this time around he is no longer prone to hiding his identity because he revealed it to the public. This sparks controversy, shocks and outcry through the US government.The acting is superb, Whiplash is very intriguing, when he is actually in it; mostly revolving around his real identity- Ivan Vanko. Robert Downey Jr also delivers a stellar performance as Stark, who's device is not only saving him but killing him also.The special effects are amazing whether it is chopping race-cars in two or Iron Man fighting corrupted robots next to war machine, it is sure to be one of the best visually of the yearOverall, you're in for one hell of a ride, i would give it a seven and a half but it is closer to an eight.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A 'Stark' contrast to the original,"I walked into the first 'Iron Man' movie with low expectations, but came out pleasantly surprised at how good the flick was.The opposite can be said for 'Iron Man 2'.Unlike its predecessor, the narrative of the sequel was flat and Dull, trying desperately at times to cram in sub plots of little interest, seemingly for the benefit of future 'Marvel' films (Avengers).The movie was disappointing overall but not without its good points. The look of the film is superb, with stunning visual effect put to good use in many creative and innovative set pieces.Great performances once again from returning cast members Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow, with Mickey Rouke stealing the show as Ivan Vanko.However, the characters of Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) added nothing of any interest, with their screen time slowing down an already tedious storyline. Two characters inserted only to serve as a tie in to the aforementioned Avengers movie.I would sum up Iron Man 2 as a dazzling piece of eye candy with little substance. Not a complete mess, but a disappointment none the less, as it never hovered anywhere near the high standard set by the original.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 2 is the best sequel in years since star wars,"Iron Man 2 is great, it has great action scenes, great actors and actresses for the carectors, and even very funny laughs. Robert Downy Jr. is Iron Man know one can pull off Iron Man like him. Mikey Rourke is a great villin he puts the whip in whiplash. I was a little disappointed that terrince howerd wasn't gonna be war machine but Don Cheadle pulled it off wonderfuly, he was the best choice for the role sine it wasn't howerd. Gwyneth Paltrow played a great role as pepper. Scarlett Johansson was hot, slick, and sexy, she was great for the guys to watch, and did a great role of black widow. Samule L. Jackson wasn't in Iron Man that much but he did to good as a nick fury character and think he can pull it off in the new nick fury movie thats supposed to be coming out in 2011. sam rockwell was a great actor in this movie he can really make you hate him, he can play a real ass whole. And the return of leslie bibb the sexy, hot, and slutty reporter from the first Iron man, shes only in it for about 10 to 20 min. but she was hot in that amount of time.

Good fun but not as much fun as the first film.,"Iron Man 2 follows on from the hugely successful Iron Man with Robert Downey Jr reprising his role as Tony Stark/Iron Man.This time Stark reveals that he is Iron Man and denies access to companies and the military who demand to know the secret behind the suit. Enter Justin Hammer, a weapons manufacturer trying to replicate the suit and Russian Ivan Vanko who wants revenge on Stark and you have the basic set up. Set among an Expo Stark enterprises has set up and continuing the sexual attraction between Stark and Pepper Potts the film is a lot of fun.Some nifty action sequences including one during the Monaco Grand Prix keep the film moving at a good pace and the introduction of Natalie Rushman adds more sexual fun. Stark is a cheeky chap and the film is laced with some nice humour, with his constant jabs during a Senate hearing or his staff being buffeted about during the fight at the Grand Prix. Downey Jr has fun in this role and so too does Sam Rockwell with Hammer and Don Cheadle in the role of Lt.Col. Rhodes, with Scarlet Johannson doing a nice job as Rushman.The first Iron Man was a really enjoyable romp, with much more humour throughout and it's sequel feels a little tired and flat for the most part. It's also it seems more of a set up for future films based around The Shield/Avengers of which a plethora of upcoming films are hinted at including a sequence after the credits obviously highlighted the film Thor. This might excite some who are fans, but I found it a little annoying, but perhaps if you don't really follow these things, you might not pick up on them.It's a fun film, even if it's predecessor is better, but like many of these films is you don't analyze it too much (like how does anyone fly with that suit exactly and where does all the ammunition go?!) you have yourself a perfect DVD for watching on the sofa with chocolates and snacks, which is exactly what I did.More of my reviews at iheartfilms.weebly.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
entertaining (but Mickey Rourke doesn't pass for a Russian),"First, I should admit that I had never heard of Iron Man until the first movie got released. The first movie was certainly entertaining, as is this sequel (the third one was to a lesser extent). My only beef with this one is that Mickey Rourke's portrayal of the villain comes across as awkward; he's played lots of good roles, but he's the wrong person to cast as a Russian. I guess that we can ignore that and luxuriate in the title character's antics. I haven't seen ""The Avengers"" (or most of the other superhero movies from the past few years; there are so many that I can't tell which is which).Basically, we can recognize the movie as nice brain candy. I wonder how Stan Lee originally came with the idea for a superhero who wears an exoskeleton.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
They don't call it Marvel for nothing! Great Film.,"It's an intelligent movie that actually works way above the level set up by a lot of previous comic adaptations. Without question, the makers of this movie went all the way in making it a remarkable experience for everyone. To their credit, they never assumed that the hype or good will of the first film was good enough to put butts in the seats. They really respect the source material but they've accentuated the believable and realistic angles of a great story. This is a story about great characters first. The action stemming from that is amazing and only serves to add to a great story. Tony Stark is about a hero's journey of internal struggle. He's a complicated character and he represents the dark side in all of us and the hope that we can overcome those demons. Everything was juggled perfectly but I expected no less from this crew. They don't call it Marvel for nothing.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Better than the average, but not up with the best","Iron Man 2 is a good film. It has two dymanic, beautiful leads at the top of their game. Is has a mean looking, potentially threatening bad guy. It has smart, shiny, clever technology and mercifully, at 124 mins, isn't too long. These are all good qualities and add up to a solid piece of cinematic entertainment.It is a sequel, and a piece of a greater story, so does it stand alongside it's predecessor. Not particularly well, sadly. It lacks the freshness and revelatory qualities of the original and doesn't provide anything new. This time Iron Man is confronted with more Iron Men. So I guess it's just, literally, more of the same. The relationship between Stark and buddy Rhodes is rehashes rather than built upon, likewise with loyal confidante and friend Pepper Potts, where there is a clearly a spark, but adds no more than a kiss toward the end - an easy cop-out.Where it's greatest failure lies, is that there isn't really any excitement. The bad guy, Mickey Rourke, confronts Stark/Iron Man during a sensational, thrilling action set-piece in Monaco (with a very cool weapon, by the way), but then virtually disappears for the entire second act, while the less effective (though highly entertaining) ""other"" bad guy, Hammer takes over. There is no tension building and no real threat to Iron Man (other than a serious butt-kicking). The hero never really seems in any real danger - even when he faces death fron his own life-saving chest thing, he simply invents a new one and the problem is solved.So, how does it rate overall. A good film, entertaining, clever... better than your average hero movie, but not up with the best. By the time",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Iron Man 2 has all the parts there, but something still seems to be missing...","I have found it hard to explain what is exactly wrong with this film.The script is a bit lazy and its obvious the studio stayed firmly in the comfort zone when they made this film, but its far from a terrible story or indeed a weak one. It is however fairly predictable for the most part, but with this genre that isn't unique either. It has its moments where it is almost fresh in its approach but then lets itself down by cute coincidences or amazing convenience to help the storyline along. The dialogue in the film is great, and at times it's a credit to the film that some of the best scenes come from non combative periods where Tony is simply interacting in a very human way with one of the other characters.The characters within the film are solid enough, and all acted anywhere between competently and brilliantly. Specific merit must be handed to Sam Rockwell's Justin Hammer, the Tony Stark wannabe who is always looking out foe his own interests. Rourke does well with what is essentially a weakly comprised character in whiplash, a character who seemingly is a brilliant scientist but also an immoral muscular killer (the writer having his cake and eating it by the looks of it). Robert Downey Jr is always excellent when slapping us with a witty one liner, but for some reason the makers of the film felt that Stark needed to be filled with daddy issues and have him moping around in self pity rather than being a little bit more close to the bone in areas such as his drinking problem and realisation of mortality (both attempted at but neither really let off the leash in any way).The action sequences are best described as 'efficient'. They have moments of unique ideas, but the strange abruptness of them and a seeming lack of any kind of flow to them makes them almost forgettable as a set piece, only leaving you with a memory of a specific use of a weapon or a one liner Stark might have reeled off during. This interspersed with lulls in the films general flow (on too many occasions unnecessarily to allow us to endure Stark's self pity again) really ends up frustrating since they highlight the dip in the film between the several genuinely great scenes it contains.The nods to avengers related references was great as a fan of the marvel universe, but also served as a reminder that this film had been tainted by the need to promote the franchise it was a part of rather than simply letting the film breathe on its own. And the sense this might have been rushed a little to meet a set timetable for films leading up to the crown jewel avengers film at the end of it all cannot be dismissed lightly.In summary, the characters and dialogue carry what is otherwise an inessential sequel, and although a little jerky throughout and ultimately leaving you a little let down, it's still better than a lot of the more average efforts marvel have recently produced. To try and determine where it exactly went wrong is not easy, as all the parts are there but yet something still feels missing, and that could simply be a bit of a soul. The safe zone marvel and the studio bosses hide inside may have left the film a little sterile ultimately.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Bigger, Faster, Dumber, and Way Way Louder","Iron Man 2 (2:05, PG-13, Imax) — Fantasy: Comics & Pulps, biggie, sequelThis film suffered from what I'm calling Transformers 2 syndrome: It's bigger, faster, dumber, and way way louder than the original.I like Marvel's Iron Man. He's one of the few comic-book characters who doesn't fetishize his secret identity. Quite the contrary, in fact. It's billionaire industrialist Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) who's the larger-than-life personality. He revels in his role as world savior, but he's clear right up front that it's all about him; Iron Man is just a suit of armor he wears when it, um, suits him.Like DC's Bruce Wayne, AKA Batman, Stark doesn't have any innate superpowers. He's just genius-level smart; really good with gadgets; and blessed with scads and scads of money, which gives him free time, independence, access to the world's best technology, and not much need for accountability. But, whereas Wayne is constantly plagued by self-doubt, Stark is supremely self-confident. Indeed, in this sequel he doesn't even blink when owning up to a psychiatric evaluation of narcissism.Sigmund Freud would have had a field day with the daddy issues on display between Stark, villain Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), and their respective fathers, Howard and Anton. The dads were both genius inventors themselves, but Howard went on to fame, glory, and wealth, while native Russian Anton was driven from the country in disgrace during the McCarthy era. Howard is long dead, and Tony remembers him as aloof and distant, but early in the movie Anton is shown dying in penury and misery in Siberia as Ivan looks on. With his dying breath, Anton blames the entire Stark family for his misfortune, and Ivan sets out to settle old family scores.Here's where things start to get ... well, unbelievable is too strong a word for a premise that has already stretched believability to a fine sheen, but let's say sloppy. We're asked to buy into plot premises that frankly don't bear close examination.Right off the bat, we're supposed to believe that the 2 dads, back in the Cold War era, came up with brilliant weapon designs that nobody in the intervening half-century has even thot of, let alone tried to build. Anton's take the form of weathered blueprints, while Howard's were disguised as the landscape architecture for the Stark Expo Plaza (a roman a clef version of the 1965 New York World's Fair grounds).Then we're supposed to accept that Ivan knows exactly where to find Tony: driving a Formula 1 car at the Monaco Grand Prix. Ivan makes his 1st public appearance as Whiplash, wielding 2 powerful sparky electronic whips that can shear an engine block in half. Except that we just saw Tony take the driver's seat at the last possible minute, claiming that it wasn't any fun owning a race car unless he could drive it himself. His hypercompetent, loyal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) looks on aghast as this scene plays out on live TV. We see the regular driver throwing down his helmet in disgust and stalking off. So how did Ivan know this was going to happen? As I said, sloppy.Similarly, screenwriter Justin Theroux makes a big deal about Ivan's love of birds. Rival military industrialist Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) tries to ingratiate himself with Ivan by promising to fetch his birds from the old country, but then tries to pass off a replacement cockatoo as the original. Ivan makes a huge fuss over this. We're convinced that this bird will eventually play some kind of significant role in the film's resolution, but no. So why spend all the screen time setting it up?Conversely, we get almost no screen time explaining the relationship between Lt. Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes and Tony. Indeed, on the 1st 3 occasions where we encounter them together, they seem to be working at cross purposes, and Rhodey's primary allegiance is clearly to his employers at the Pentagon, as he absconds with one of Tony's spare suits of armor to turn over to Hammer. Rhodey didn't get much play in the 1st movie, where he was portrayed by Terrence Howard, and so people who attended the sequel needed more of a clue that he was supposed to be Tony's boon companion and trusted confidant, especially since switching actors to Don Cheadle further undermined the continuity.And there are 3 characters — Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johannsson), and Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) — who are agents of SHIELD, but absolutely no effort whatsoever is expended explaining what SHIELD is, what it's relationship is to the Pentagon, or why Tony Stark is giving them the time of day.In short, while director Jon Favreau does a fine job with all the slam-bang action/adventure stuff that most viewers probably signed up for, we were evidently expected to check our brains at the door. And it's not as if they couldn't have made this stuff more believable; they just didn't try!The ""surprise"" at the end consisted of a car driving aaaaccccrrrroosssss ttthhheee dddeesssseerrrt, finally arriving at a big circular excavation; the viewpoint tilts down, and we get a brief glimpse of Mjolnir.

One of the most enjoyable films I've ever seen,"You need very little persuasion to fall into this movie's utterly entertaining world. I really can't imagine anyone not liking it. Robert Downey Jr., Scarlett Johansson, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Sam Rockwell in particular all put in near perfect, memorable performances. But it's the very well written story that carried the day, for me. It's not real deep but it's not mere window dressing either. What would Ironman do if requested to give his technology to the military? And how would he handle toe to toe competition? And there's more, but it's better you see it rather than hear about it.John Favreau is clearly gaining in skill and ambition as director while still being willing to feed our male fantasies. Scarlett is a great example as the lithesome Natasha Romanoff. No graphic novel could ever match her role for visual female sumptuousness and sheer beauty. You'll wish there was more of her though wisely Favreau leaves you slightly frustrated.All in all a fun movie way beyond my expectations. But I'm glad I'm not Favreau. What could he do to top these two movies?",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
nothing special about this one,"I must admit that after seeing jon favreau in couples retreat i felt that this one might suck, especially since it had to live up to the high hopes of the pretty good first one. Luckily for me it was pretty decent and i could rest easy knowing that favreau got into couples retreat for the money (i hope), that he hadn't gone completely crazy and got into that piece of trash for the plot.Still, they are no real OMFG moments here, the comedy is the real gem of this picture, with Downey Jr continuing to show he is a master of subtle clever wit. All in all it was definitely a good time at the movies with friends, just not really anything to write home about.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not the usual kind of sequel,"In Iron Man 2, Robert Downey Jr. returns as billionaire Tony Stark, this time facing pressures from the government to share his armor technology with the military. At the same time, he discovers the technology which keeps him alive is also slowly killing him. He appoints Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) as CEO of Stark Industries, while her old job goes to Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson). Meanwhile, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), the son of his father's enemy, joins forces with Stark's rival competitor Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell).First off, I enjoyed the first Iron Man, but I wasn't a huge fan. I felt Jon Favreau's direction and Robert Downey Jr. made the film better than what it could've been. Tony Stark was fun, story was okay, and the villain was a bit disappointing. The idea of the villain being just another version of the protagonist never appealed to me. I felt the same way about the wannabe-Hulk villain in Incredible Hulk. Now, if the villain is very different from the hero (Joker vs. Batman / Superman vs. Lex Luthor / Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock), the hero has to apply different strategies, which makes for more entertaining battles. Well, in the Iron Man sequel, that idea hasn't changed too much—Iron Man still battles a similar foe, although there are now more of them. Thankfully, the shootouts, the flights, the computerized special effects, and the mass destruction are a lot of fun to watch, but it is not the central focus.This film's focus is all about the characters, an unusual direction for a sequel. It's no Transformers 2, that's for sure. Majority of the time, you won't see Tony Stark in armor. You do, however, get to see a bit of a darker and a vulnerable side to Tony, which happens to make him more complex, engaging, and sometimes, dangerous. Robert Downey Jr. plays Tony flawlessly, and he's just as much fun, if not more, than before. Some may be put off by the dialogue-driven first half of the film. The film isn't all about ""let's hurry up and get him to fight somebody."" In fact, it takes its time, and there's not a whole lot of action in the beginning, but there's a certain build-up that leads to the eventual confrontation with the baddies. The film isn't so much about a specific villain or a goal, but it is mainly about Tony, his psychology, and his reactions to life. Gwyneth Paltrow is back as Pepper Potts—she is as we remember her from the last film—charming and continuously getting Stark out of trouble.Many interesting side characters make an appearance this time around. Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) plays more of a prominent role as the leader of S.H.I.E.L.D. Scarlett Johansson has great screen presence as Natalie Rushman (aka. Black Widow)—she holds herself pretty well in a great martial arts scene. Don Cheadle has replaced Terrance Howard as Lt. Col. ""Rhodey"" and gets to play a more prominent role as an Iron Man suit-armored partner to Tony. This film, unlike the first film, tends to lean towards the idea of teamwork more. (Perhaps they're just prepping us for an Avenger film?) Mickie Rourke is engaging on screen as the Russian physicist villain Ivan, which he plays with dark relish. Although his technology—glowing, electrically charged whips—isn't anything new, he is always fun to watch. Likewise, Sam Rockwell is great as usual as a villain, the wisecracking Justin Hammer.The plot simply continues on from the last film, after people have found out the true identity of Iron Man. While it's nothing too complex, the progression of the story is logical--it would surely bring some enemies out of the woodwork if they knew who he was. The film's pacing isn't as zippy as the first film, where something always seems to be happening, and some audiences may be disappointed as a result.Overall, I found Iron Man 2 to be entertaining and a worthy sequel, and just different enough not to feel tacked on like an add-on to the previous film. Many sequels can get lazy—they just throw in everything and make it bigger and louder. Some sequels simply let the story progress. This is that kind of sequel. I give Iron Man 2 *** out of **** stars.You can also follow my reviews on http://twitter.com/d_art",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Bigger does indeed not always equal better,"I enjoyed almost all of this. It does have things that the first lacks, such as a villain presence, grander battles(and more armored participants in them, without getting excessive; some will argue that it's chasing first, combat second), and a greater amount of action(if a little of it is merely showing off) which, again, puts you right in the situation, as well as during flight(not as spectacular or breathtaking, not sure why). There is not a lot of tension in this, certain things don't pay off(this forgets that it's its own thing, not only a setup for Avengers) or have consequences, and there's not enough sense of ""danger"". The score, with a handful of exceptions, is a wallflower. I barely noticed it. This is missing the constant energy that its predecessor had, albeit it relatively seldom really slows down. There is not sufficient development for the plot(that never really grabs us) or the characters(of whom there are too many and they are not all granted motives, nor do they always make sense in what they do), and so much occurs in merely one film. Next to nothing moves ahead from where it was left off last time. The Black Widow gets to do a bit of awesome fighting(a little of it looks odd somehow, perhaps because of the angles), Johansson nails the femme fatale thing(looking *stunning* all the while) and if you think catsuits can't get any hotter, you *need* to see her in hers... but she(and a rockin' Jackson) serve no purpose, and they are not used for *anything* in this. Dialog can get a tad annoying, especially that of the overly dorky and awkward Rockwell(why is it popular to put weird roles in American flicks?). With that said, the humor is of the same tone and typically works, the lines are(often) as fast and as sharp, the acting is great, the FX are photo-realistic(thank you, ILM) and beautiful(without getting terribly indulgent), it is exciting and the editing and cinematography are excellent, this time, as well. If you want to be entertained, this will do the trick, if you expect a similar approach as what we got from Favreau before. This is not as good, however. There is plenty of mild violence, several instances of suggestive/skin-laden material and infrequent moderate language in this. I recommend this to any fan(and if you like the comics and the tying together of the franchise, stay after the credits). 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Like a drunked party you don't want to go to.,"Back in 2008 when Iron Man was the insane box-office smash, truthfully never bothered to see it in theaters. I had no interest in the film, no matter how positively the reviews read. It was released on DVD at the beginning of Autumn, I did rent it to see if I would fall under the spell of Iron Man...I didn't. I thought it was neat, but my heart wasn't in perpetuated with it. I was astonished that people compared it to the Christopher Nolan masterpiece,The Dark Knight, released that same year. When Iron Man 2 was released, the same situation occurred (almost like deja vu), where I rented it, didn't care for it (though I did take interest in the stunningly beautiful Pepper Potts). Fast-forward to 2013, days after of the Iron Man 3 release. Gwyneth Paltrow had become my celebrity obsession, Iron Man 3 was denting box-office, and reviews were pouring in claiming part 3 outgrew its predecessor. I saw it twice in theaters, enjoyed it, but found the entire experience to be polarizing. After living my infatuation with Gwyneth Paltrow for months, I decided to revisit the films and found my opinions to have morphed into new thoughts.IRON MAN 2 (2010)It's so disappointing to say that such a smashing film was followed by a sequel that barely knows how to walk let alone run. Every scene is written and cut like the filmmakers said ""Good enough."" Even the most laid back viewer would be able to pick up on Iron Man 2's lazy writing and sloppy arcs. The poor choreography and occasional plot holes create too silly of an environment at times, which is supported by some nauseating dialogue. The whole picture feels like one of the drunken parties we would see in Iron Man 2, where Tony Stark is making an ass out of himself: we don't want to be there when we know the man has so much more to offer. The film doesn't fail completely, mostly due to the bracing visual effects and the hardworking cast of characters. It's wonderful to see Downey Jr., Paltrow, and Johansson work together and collaborate here. The comedy that the first film skated on is only found in the raillery between Tony and Pepper. Justin Theroux wrote the ""screenplay"" for this sequel, I think he should stick to acting or learn to pen some narrative flow into his writing.Rating: 4/10Grade: CAnyone can tell you that Robert Downey Jr.'s screen presence is what guided the series to the popularity levels it reached. Downey's effortless charm is so believable, it makes you wonder if he's really putting forth the effort in his acting or if he's playing an exaggerated version of himself. He has superlative chemistry with his co-star Gwyneth Paltrow and together, they are the pillars that ground the series. Both actors excel in the entire trilogy making the acting the most dependable aspect in the series. ""I watched the Iron Man movies to see Gwyneth Paltrow"" said no one in history other than Ryan C. Showers.Even with two sequels that didn't live up to the standard set with the shining original film, it's a movie series that is a fun ride. Tony Stark is just as an amusing character as you will find in the action hero category today. The special effects are always worthy of our attention and the actors pull together something that may have been ambiguous on the page. Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and Iron Man 3 are blockbusters with a little more than you could hope for.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

So much fun!,"So I'm the type of person who rates movies based on their enjoyability and how much I personally enjoyed them. Like, I would give Sherlock Holmes a 9.5/10 while I'd give Avatar a 8/10 just due to expectations and enjoyability.Anyway, Iron Man 2 was A LOT OF FUN. I loved it. I went to the midnight premiere and was laughing during the entire movie. Of course, I had read the reviews anticipating a kick-butt beginning and ending with a slow middle, but that's not how the movie was for me. IM2 was one fun ride that rarely let up on its humor. Compared to IM, I don't know. I think it's just as good--if not better (WHAT?! Yes, I don't agree with the majority of IMDBers)--but it's different so I don't know how to compare.The cast did a spectacular job. RDJ was top-notch, him and Gwyneth had delightful chemistry, Rourke was crazy intimidating, Rockwell was good over-the-top funny, Scarlett was kick-butt, and special shout-out to Favreau who was funny. Cheadle was fine...I wasn't particularly amazed by his performance, but then again, I wasn't by Howard's either.One slight blip in the movie was that there were a lot of characters added so the movie had a bunch of plot lines. I didn't notice while watching the movie, but after watching it, I wish they had just stuck to one or two characters and elaborated on their story lines.Anyway, IM2 was a great movie.

Best film based on a Marvel comic,"Put simply, Iron Man 2 is the best film I've seen so far this year. That doesn't mean no movie released this year can be better than Jon Favreau's masterpiece of a comic book film, but I certainly don't think any potential blockbuster this year will be as funny, exciting, well- developed and brilliantly acted. As hard as it may be to imagine, Iron Man 2 is even better than the original movie - and, you know, the first part was, along with Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, one of the best comic book films ever made. It does almost nothing wrong, and while it isn't 100% brilliant all the way, it's as good as any ""traditional"" comic book adaptation can be. (The Dark Knight being a ""non-traditional"" adaptation.)The story is a little more convoluted than in the first movie, but fortunately director Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunder) don't make the same mistakes Sam Raimi made with Spider-Man 3. Sure, there is more than one villain, but the only ""active"" villain is Ivan Vanko; Justin Hummer is more of an instrument, and is not a classic villain in the sense that he is neither intimidating nor particularly dangerous. He only has the ""resources.""Those who have seen the first installment might have noticed that, while the movie was excellently-written and acted, it kind-of-suffered during its climax because of some weak action. Well, this certainly isn't the problem here, since Iron Man 2 provides with some of the best action you'll see this year. Unlike, you know, a film like Transformers 2, the machine-on- machine battles in Iron Man 2 are actually exciting and tense because we know there are people behind those suits; because those people have been well-developed throughout two movies, and because Favreau, unlike Michael Bay, doesn't feel the need to shake the camera as much as possible and cutting every millisecond while shooting an action sequence.Performances, much like in the previous film, are absolutely perfect. Robert Downey Jr. is Tony Stark, there is no doubt about it, and even in the film's weakest scenes - which are very few -, Downey makes the movie work. This time around, Stark is dying - the substance that makes the suit work and keeps him alive is actually killing him - and Downey Jr. now portrays Stark not only as a charismatic playboy, but also as a somewhat deeper character, who resorts to alcoholism because of all his problems. This alcoholism is not the main point of the film, though - it certainly is addressed, but it's something that gets dismissed rather quickly. This is for the better, I believe - even more problems and another sub-plot would have only hurt the film, and I'm sure the filmmakers will be able to explore this characteristic of Tony Stark in a deeper manner in subsequent films.Don Cheadle, replacing Terrence Howard from the previous movie, is effective as Jim Rhodes. (He's even got some great one-liners.) Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Pepper Potts, and her relationship with Tony manages to move forward a little. There's great chemistry between the two of them, and they've got some great scenes together. Mickey Rourke is just great as Ivan Vanko - the majority of his dialogue is in Russian, and although he isn't precisely three- dimensional, we know just enough about the characters for him to remain both (a little) mysterious and intimidating. Sam Rockwell is also delightful as Justin Hammer - a very coward and unlikeable characters, that's for sure, but Rockwell manages not to turn him into a caricature. Scarlett Johansson, on the other hand, is just superb as agent Natasha Romanoff. With this part not only does she prove that she's the sexiest, most beautiful actress alive - one just has to hear men's reaction in the theatre whenever she appeared on- screen -, but also that she may be able to hand an entire action film by herself. She was just... *sigh*... amazing.So is the film perfect? Not really, but its faults are small enough for them not to hurt he overall quality of the picture. Still, while the John Debney's score wasn't particularly awful or bothersome, it simply was... mediocre. There's nothing memorable or outstanding about his music. It's just... there. Completely forgettable. On the other hand, while I certainly was excited about the presence of a couple of AC/DC songs (Shoot to Thrill and Highway to Hell), I expected more of them, at least three or four, not just two! I mean, there's a reason why the film's soundtrack is made up entirely of AC/DC songs right? (I already bought it, by the way, and it's a nice re-collection of classic songs.) For example, if you know AC/DC has a song called War Machine and one of the characters in your movie is called ""War Machine""... wouldn't it be logical for you to put that song in the film? Hopefully they're saving it for the next installment or something.Anyway, those faults aren't particularly big, and the film as a whole is just amazing. It had been some time since I last left the theatre so excited. I mean, I am studying film-making, and when I left the theatre after watching Iron Man 2 I just thought ""this is the kind of film I want to make."" And by that I don't mean a superhero movie necessarily... I mean a film that does so many things correctly: it's laugh-out-loud hilarious at times, but it's also incredibly exciting. It's got some amazing special effects, interesting and believable characters, great performances, a complex but effective plot and it even works as a set up for a bigger universe of superheroes. Once again, Iron Man 2 is the best film I've seen this year so far, and I just can't imagine any blockbuster being more successful. I'm definitely seeing it again a couple of times in theatres... yes, it's that good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An Injection of adrenalin and poor character development,"To be honest with you , the future audience of this movie, its worth every penny. Of course just like every other movie it has its strengths and weaknesses.Its strengths are it has a well written script and it also has a compelling plot.Robert downy Jr. doesn't hesitate to make you laugh and beats you straight to the punch. Another strength is how well made the CGI effects were. Im honest when I say that I usually look for the most realism and and most bull crap moments in any movie that I watch. I especially look for the ""nu-uh that can't happen!?"" moments. now here are the weaknesses. The only way you may understand this movie......to fully comprehend where it is coming from is if you watch the first movie. Because the movie doesn't give any character depth or character development. ""If you watch this movie you will probably ask yourselves what the heck is going on?"" if you don't watch the first movie. Another weakness that was a huge part for me, was that the movie did not mention anything about the AVENGERS only until the end. And don't get your hopes up the only mention about the avengers is on a label on a folder on Tony Starks desk and he doesn't even open it. In conclusion I give this movie a 7 out of 10 and that is already a lot in my reviews. definitely watch this movie if you have seen the first one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A perfectly efficient blockbuster, but not a perfect film","Iron Man 2 is a perfectly efficient blockbuster, but not a perfect film. In the era of Dark Knights and Bourne Ultimatums, it might be more common for fans to expect a sequel to live up to – or, rather, even surpass -- its predecessor, but let's be frank: most of them don't. Whether it's Rocky or Police Academy, most sequels tend to bury themselves into the ground.Held to this standard, Iron Man 2 is entirely competent – a fun, mindless blockbuster – but it's not necessarily superior to the first film, and that might disappoint fans who were expecting more.It's probably better to address the weaknesses first: number one would be Mickey Rourke's role as Ivan ""Whiplash"" Vanko. When Robert Downey, Jr. campaigned for Rourke to be cast during the 2009 Oscar race, I was ecstatic; I thought he'd knock his role out of the park. And he definitely tries his best, but the character – as written in Justin Theorux's screenplay – is curiously minor (and, truth be told, his suit's pretty lame). He has a grand introduction during the pre-credits; then disappears for most of the film. He reappears at the end for what we expect to be a climactic battle, but (without spoiling anything), it's even more underwhelming than Jeff Bridges' battle at the end of the first film, which was one of the few things that some fans seemed to quibble about back then.Some critics have written off Iron Man 2 as being another Spider-Man 3 due to its extraneous subplots and characters, but honestly, it's not nearly that bad. Yet there's no denying it does feature too many characters – Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) serves no true purpose other than to establish herself for further Avengers-style spin-offs; Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury seems to appear merely because of his purpose in the grand scheme of things rather than because he's necessary for this particular film's narrative. And director Jon Favreau's Happy Hogan character (who showed up briefly in the first film) has waaay too many ""cameos"" here – maybe he's setting himself up for future installments (which would assure him a spot in the films he's not directing, I suppose), but the character feels wholly pointless. And Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is largely relegated to the sidelines – if you took her out of the film you probably wouldn't really notice.Sam Rockwell rocks (I'm surprised Peter Travers didn't try that one in his review) and is one of the strengths of the film; charismatic and funny, he gives Downey, Jr. a run for his money. He was one of the studio's original choices to play Tony Stark during pre-production on the first film, and after seeing him here, as an equally egoistic adversary to Stark, it's easy to see why.Downey, Jr. himself is still great, but – much like his real-life self – much of the sudden public adoration has rendered him even more arrogant, and I have to admit that, as a result, I didn't enjoy his role quite as much. It's not so much the performance (Downey's rarely in poor form) as it is the character.These are the negatives. The film does have a lot going for it – it's pretty fun, goes by rather quickly (despite all the subplots going on) and features enough well-edited action to please the sort of junkies who loathed Transformers 2. (Plus, none of the robots in this one talk jive.) While not quite as impressive as its predecessor, Iron Man 2 is definitely an efficient blockbuster. There's nothing here as complex or challenging as, say, The Dark Knight, but it is what it is, and in spite of some wandering plot lines, it doesn't attempt to overreach. You pretty much know what you're getting going into this flick, which is more than can be said for many pictures.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not that much of excitement but entertaining enough!,"The Iron Man sequel did not meet in my opinion the expectations, and that probably because we already liked so much the first movie. To be fair it was a great action-movie, not slow-paced, with good visuals and that captured the essence of Iron Man but other than that it just missed something.The storyline is pretty much simple and predictable but since it's an Iron Man movie we couldn't expect of some mind-twisting story but it could have been better. I mean if the story was more complex it would have been more explosive and the character inter-relationship could have been built a little better but since it was not than it's just ... the regular comic book Iron Man movie. Besides that the visuals were NOT that great as people might think. The editing of the scenes was done well but the way some of the scenes were captured especially the ones where is involved flying like in the beginning where you have to really stare at the screen to realize what Iron Man is doing because the scenes are too quickly cut. The visuals are good but not that good I mean for a 2010 movie I was expecting something better, not Avatar type but neither to be a little bit over that G.I. Joe bullsh*t. Besides that the cinematography is good and offers some nice stand-up captures and scenes.The acting of the movie was If I think better than the first one. I mean Robert Downey Jr. played very well the extravagant and cocky Tony Stark, Mickey Rourke offered a very good display as the Russian, Ivan, you have Samuel L Jackson as Nick Furry and a very good performance by Sam Rockwell who plays Justin Hammer.The thing I was 10 minutes cheering for and 10 minutes disappointed about was the music used in this movie. The one composed I liked it but some of it was just used wrong...At the end of the day this is a kick-ass movie, it;s a great action flick, with jokes, explosions, nice ladies, very good acting and with all the douchey scenes (and YES! it has douchy scenes) it was very entertaining. As to say if it was better than the first I don't know... It depends on how you see it and what you expect from an Iron Man movie, I liked the first one much more because the dialogue was more interesting and here it was full of jokes and stuff not to mention the character development which was better in the first than in this one but this one is like I said, a great movie to get me and you entertained and definitely worth the money.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"it's a challenge to build the second piece of the puzzle, but by Jove, director Jon Favreau and his cast and crew have done it with flying colors","It was quite a challenge to top such an exhilarating, original (at least by today's storytelling standards) summer extravaganza like 2008's big hit ""Iron Man."" That film was well done on a technical level, but the reason why it is so good and why it is twice the movie that ""Transformers"" (2007) was because it used its special effects as a service to its story instead of simply relying on them to save the day. So it's a real challenge to not only build on that, but improve upon that. But by Jove, director Jon Favreau and his cast and crew have done that with flying colors with ""Iron Man 2"" which to my mind is not only better than the original, but the best film that I've seen so far this year.The movie picks up where the first one left with Robert Downey Jr.'s alcoholic, eccentric character of Tony Stark revealing his alter-ego identity as Iron Man. While he combats a power-greedy senator's strive to strip him of his technological triumph and to maintain a somewhat stable employer-employee (and sometimes romantic) relationship to his assistant Pepper Potts, again played with grace and conviction by Gwyneth Paltrow, a new villain with his own technological tools and dazzling wit (Mickey Rourke) arrives, seeking revenge not only on Stark as a person, but his legacy.It seems to be a trend these days for the second installment in superhero movie franchises to be better than the first. That was the case with Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" saga, with Christopher Nolan's marvelous reinvention of the Batman character, and now with Jon Favreau's Iron Man pictures. In my original review, I stated that I really enjoyed the first ""Iron Man"" picture but felt that its climax was a little lacking and that there were some weak zones in its plot. However, all of that is built up and enhanced with the sequel and if there is one word I can use to describe it, it is: exhilarating. Even as it builds up new story lines with new characters, some of which may be ostensibly unnecessary, it never bogs down.Like ""Spider-Man 2"", ""Iron Man 2"" brings up the plot element of the main character's alter-ego taking over his life to the point where his normal life starts to fall apart, causing him to shun his responsibilities and obligations. Although this is a sort of familiar story, the filmmakers do a great job at keeping things on the move. What's also great, and carrying down from the first picture is how it's not all grim and tough, but has effective moments of comedy such as a scene where Scarlett Johanssen reveals to a cocky boxing manager that she knows a little more about the sport than she led him to believe. And of course the highlights are conversations between Robert Downey, Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow and these melodramatic moments are blended with the more traditional tones seamlessly so that it does not feel like the movie is phasing in and out of one personality, heck, like its central character.You want special effects? You got 'em. Just like in the first picture, ""Iron Man 2"" is packed with lots of explosives, bursts of action, ear-jarring sound effects, and marvelous camera tricks and cinematography to lock the audience's attention in place. But once again, these special effects, unlike the effects in ""Transformers"" and its sequel, are used as a service to the story and that is why they do not overstay their welcome. The movie saves its drawn-out climax to the end and this climax is twice as exciting as the somewhat shallow final battle of the first movie.Robert Downey Jr. is still most effective as the troubled character of Tony Stark. He's charming, witty, humorous, and believable not as a caricature, but as a human being. Gwyneth Paltrow is equally effective as Pepper Potts; Scarlett Johansson is both seductive and convincing as the new assistant who has her own way of backing herself up; Sam Rockwell does a fantastic job playing the techno-dweeb big on money but short on brawn; Mickey Rourke is sinister and cold-blooded as the villain; and Don Cheadle does a surprisingly good job taking over for Terence Howard as Tony Stark's military pal.I can't think of one person I know whom I won't recommend seeing ""Iron Man 2."" From start to finish, this is one exhilarating piece of film-making. It excels, I say, over its already exhilarating predecessor and many of its companion superhero sagas, and proves itself to be one truly enjoyable time at the movies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What a summer blockbuster sequel should be!,"Big expectations from the original are hard to live up to, which just seems unfair to this reasonably enjoyable and exciting sequel. Going over that age-old Hollywood mantra that ""bigger is better"", this sequel throws in bigger set-pieces, better special effects and a superb cast. But unlike most sequels to successful hits, IRON MAN 2 is not only big in terms of special effects and action set-pieces, it also has stronger characters (perhaps the only real problem with that is that they're too many of them) and an even stronger plot.As with the other people who enjoyed the first IRON MAN movie, my hopes were high for the sequel. As in other superb comic-book movie sequels like SPIDER-MAN 2 and THE DARK KNIGHT, the storyline frees itself from the exposition settled in the first movie and are now able to take the story into a different direction for the sequel. Following the end of the first movie, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has already admitted his identity as Iron Man and, as he puts it, ""successfully privatized world peace"". Arrogant as he is, he gets the job done, but saving the world is only half the battle. Stark also has a demanding Senator Stern (Gary Shandling) on his back who wants his Iron Man technology surrendered to the military, a similarly egotistic rival (Sam Rockwell) who wants Stark and his crowning achievement be reduced to yesterday's news, and of course there's vengeful Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) bent on killing Stark to avenge his father. Only to make matters worse, the arc reactor that's keeping Stark alive is slowly poisoning his blood, and would kill him if he doesn't find a substitute to the reactor's Palladium content.There are enough characters here that could have made this as an early reunion for The Avengers, with a powerhouse of a cast to boot. In addition to the return of Downey's egotistic Stark and Gwyneth Paltrow's delightful portrayal as long-suffering assistant-turned-CEO Pepper Potts, there's also Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff aka Black Widow (Scarlett Johnasson in a black leather suit and sporting red hair! 'Nuff said), Samuel L. Jackson's return as Nick Fury (after a very brief cameo in the first), Don Cheadle replacing Terence Howard as Lt. Col. ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (who finally gets his ""next time"" opportunity as he dons the suit as the battle-ready War Machine), and even Favreau's Happy Hogan (nothing more than an extended cameo in the first film) gets more screen time. On the bag guy side is Rourke's disgruntled Vanko, Rockwell playing another character we would love to hate, and Shandling's hilarious portrayal of a greedy politician. Too many of these characters could have repeated the misstep that SPIDER-MAN 3 had done; too many characters with too many subplots that ruin the flow of the story. But director Jon Favreau and writer Justin Theroux avoid this pitfall by just giving our characters enough screen time that they deserve and only throwing in subplots that actually move the story along.IRON MAN 2 is what a summer blockbuster sequel should be; it throws in everything we expect from its superb predecessor and giving is a little more without being something akin to an overstuffed, overcooked turkey. The action sequences are great in the first movie, and they're even bigger here. It even has a better, more thrilling climax than the one in he first, and more interesting and even outrageous villains than in the original. As usual, Downey Jr. is still one of the chief delights with his portrayal of a different kind of comic-book hero. Throw in a cast that looks absolutely perfect and every thrilling action set-piece in place and you have a sequel that's actually worth the wait.Rating: **** out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not up to the standard the first set, but still one to check out.","Two years ago, the first Iron Man movie was released, becoming a surprise critical and commercial success. So, naturally, a sequel was inevitable. The question was, can the sequel fulfill what seems to be the code for comic book movies, and top the first? The answer: Not quite. But that is not to say it was a bad movie at all. It just falls short of great. One of the main issues of the movie was the pacing. There were many points where it lagged, leaving you simply waiting for the next scene. It just felt a little padded out. It just didn't feel as well put together as the first.Of course, the movie had many good points as well, including Robert Downey Jr pulling out his charisma again as Tony Stark and Mickey Rourke embracing his dark side to play a pretty good villain. Not to mention Don Cheadle doing a fine job stepping into the role of Rhodey that Terrence Howard playing in the first, with this time the character having a much bigger and better role. When the action scenes do finally arrive, they are generally a whole lot of fun, with the exception of the big villain fight, which was sadly very anti-climactic. A big complaint from some people about the first movie was that it had a disappointing villain with a mediocre final fight. Well, Iron Man 2 had a really cool villain, but an even more mediocre final fight. The visual effects were just as good as the first film, but also seemed to be used a lot less.Also joining the cast list was the likes of Scarlett Johansson, Sam Rockwell and the director Jon Favreau, as Natalie Rushman, Justin Hammer and Happy Hogan respectively. Johansson did a decent job, not bringing a whole lot to the role, but basically all that was needed for the character. Favreau being in the movie was pretty unnecessary, with his character being basically the same sort of offsider that Favreau played in Daredevil. As Justin Hammer, Rockwell did well playing a sleazy Stark competitor.In closing, the movie is worth checking out, but make sure you don't go in expecting the first movie again. I personally enjoyed myself, despite feeling occasionally bored. I feel that it was the sort of movie that will seem better on repeat viewings, when I'm not just waiting to see when they will give us another action scene. Not that I am only interested in action scenes, it's just that as I said before, certain parts of the movie just lagged a little too long.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
What are these naysayers talking about.  This is a great sequel!,"If just for the comedy in this film it rates an 8 IMO. This has a new twist story line; great action; new science; and more laughs than I could count. The humor is fast and always coming until the very end. It's also intelligent because it makes you think about the science and the possibility of peace. In fact, the only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because it seems that all movies today need to blast your eardrums out to get people into the theaters. Hopefully, they'll learn that when you get these movies to your standard home theaters, there's a problem balancing volume for dialog and action.I thought it was a great sequel and can't imagine what the people who have been cutting it down here on IMDb were talking about.

Something of a disappointment,"IronMan 2 was a missed opportunity. The spark, the magic that made the first movie so special, was all but lost here. The inclusion of Sam L Jackson as Nick Fury and Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was completely unnecessary in terms of plot ... what one earth where they doing there? Talk about blatantly setting up the Avengers franchise. But on the strength of IronMan 2, I can't say I'm excited by the prospect. The big flaw for me was that Mickey Rourke as Whiplash was hardly in the movie, and as for how Don Cheadle becomes WarMachine ... sheesh! His motivation for grabbing an IronMan suit as Tony's party gets out of hand was totally unrealistic. As is often the case in franchise flicks, No.2 was bigger but by no means better. And, crazily, there seemed to be a severe lack of action until the very end of the movie.Number three has a lot to do ...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Despicable people wallowing in their own excrement,"I enjoyed Iron Man 1. I enjoyed the fact that the main character was brought down to earth with a big nasty bump, confronted by the reality that he sponsors, and that sponsors his reprehensible lifestyle.That the sequel should suggest that this lifestyle he 'enjoys' is to be endorsed and aspired to, automatically places it into the category of artless social propaganda. It is, essentially a tale of unlikable people with the power of life and death over others, battling it out for the right for that power. Yes, Starks realises his dad loved him really, and that he really ought to cut back on the partying, knuckle down and join the 'team America' and and fight the 'bad guys'. Those bad guys? Well, we'll see who they are in Iron Man 3.

A highly enjoyable MCU entrance,"#MCUrewatch. Okay, so probably Iron Man 2 isn't a good a film as its predecessor. In terms of narrative and character arc it isn't as good. But this film really embodies what makes the MCU so entertaining and successful. The film is so enjoyable and the two hours fly by. It gives comic book fans what they want and more. Downey Jr does a great job and high marks for Johansson, Paltrow and Jackson as well. The villains are once again one dimensional but Rourke and especially Rockwell really seems to enjoy their roles. There isn't much action which is actually a good thing. The first half feels like a exotic spy film with the whole Monaco sequence. And the final climax is effective and not over the top ""city destroying"" as some of the future films. Iron Man 1 is the better film, but I might just think its successor is more enjoyable.

"Very Little of Note, Unfortunately","The first Iron Man, although not being an amazing film, is at least somewhat distinct - which is a fair achievement since it's not necessarily the most original film. Iron Man 2 is not so distinct, and in places feels like a rehash of the first film.It would usually be customary to write some more about the various aspects of the film, but most were just so forgettable (or near-identical to the first film.)If you really enjoyed the first Iron Man then you'll surely enjoy this; if you didn't, then tough luck since it doesn't offer much that's new - although it's a perfectly competent film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Canned laughter.,"When all is said an done, Iron Man 2 delivers. The question now perhaps is, did we need it in the first place? First things first, Downey simply makes this entire franchise worth watching and waiting for. He's got the Midas touch here when he's the troubled and pseudo egotistical Tony Stark. I simply can't think of a more capable and gifted actor in the last several years who's been able to reposition himself as an elite actor after years of a spiralling demise. What Downey brings to this Marvel tin soldier is depth and heart (even if his seems to be failing). The sequel picks up where the last one left off and for the first hour really has me enjoying these faces again. And with the scope of real domestic issues here, I was captivated. But as the story continues and Marvel simply wants to force feed us the impending crisis (as Sam Jackson seems to keep popping up to remind us) in all various remote locations in the world, we have to start cataloguing what elements are important to the story today and what can be shelved for later. After all, Avengers is still years away. Sam Jackson pops up and then flares up more and more like a case of vaginal warts. He offers the parties involved nothing of substance, but the possibility of a relationship later. More and more characters are introduced, subplots and villains galore and an army of Iron men. All of this occurring at the pinnacle disintegration of Tony Stark. Here Favreau begins to touch on the real dangers that Tony has within him, but finds a quick fix amongst the film canisters of a drunken father. Before you know it, the two hours have whizzed by and you can't help but wonder if you simply watched a retread of of the first Iron Man plot line. The film still works because of the richness of all the characters and it showcases how much the best actors can take what would potentially be a subpar script and make it into a gem.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It is the action you want... - it is the action you will get!,"Metal clash watered with chatter, occasional loss of control, with your every-day cute hi-tech villains, deadly high-heel chicks, plus a healthy portion of jokes failed on most. Add to it some allegedly going on sense of love during and after the explosions, and you get Iron Man, dubbed 2.It is unfortunate that the movie fell behind on 3D in making, which is the de-facto expectation today from any high-budget action movie, so it came out flat on a few things, figuratively speaking :) Also, contrary to the expectation of a longer movie, it came out even shorter than the original: 1:52m vs 1:56m, so it does feel short, especially after watching a 2:35m Avatar spectacle.Still, I enjoyed it, but not sure if I'd see it again, unless it is re-released in 3D.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
impressive but not marvels best,"Iron man when released in 2008 made fans of the character really excited for what was next in is story and while i like the character and the story's that are told i think that this one did not impress me like it should have and that really bums me out as marvel has some of the hottest movies that have been released in recent years so i am still unsure if this one impresses me at all.
obviously Robert Downey Jr is the star of the entire movie he has really brought to life Tony Stark as the very troubled man you do really feel he kills it as the role and another star who really makes me fanboy scream is Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff and my word does she kick so much ass that it further proves how awesome she is and the villains of this movie were Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke they were perfect villains in evilness in strategy not really but i have to say there acting is not bad in this one. Don Cheadle wasLt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes which was a change from the first movie which really bothers me because in this one war machine is given more to do so i was really happy to see him team up with tony in the finale. there was some outstanding supporting actors there was Gwyneth Paltrow,Paul Bettany, Samuel L. Jackson,Clark Gregg and Jon Favreau so not only do we have a solid cast of leads we have supporting actors who to me hold it all together.
i'm really on the fence with this movie i like some aspects of it and others i hate so it would seem fairly even if they hadn't make me engaged the entire movie and that's what Marvel and the Iron man series has done so that makes me happy obviously the part which upsets me is the change of actors from Rhodey is something that upset me and i like the new one it's just something that bugs me and probably the fans too but i obviously think its still solid and it holds up and its not the best but its not the worst so i don't mind.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not  a block buster but still highly recommended,"The movies has got some strong performances by a star studded cast and impressive special effects but fails to live up to its prequel. The plot of the film is a bit uneven and it does not seamlessly blend to make it a gripping entertainer. Robert Downey Jr is excellent as ever but did not have many wise-cracks in his dialogue delivery as in the prequel. Also some of the sequences around Robery getting drunk in the iron man suit and him sitting in the middle of the large do-nut seemed a bit un-necessary. I loved Micky Rourke in his role but Don Cheadle does not come anywhere close to Terrence Howard in his role.

Iron Man 2,"Iron Man 2 is based upon the comic book series created by Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby. The film is also a sequel to the 2008 film Iron Man. Basically, I figure that if you are reading this review and you are interested in seeing Iron Man 2, then you are probably a fan of the original film two years ago, the comic book series, or perhaps both. For that reason I am not going into a lengthy synopsis of the plot because the fans know what they are in for and they are the ones who are going to go and see this movie. The 2008 Iron Man film, I found to just be okay. I think the thing I really liked about it was Robert Downey Jr's performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He was narcissistic and arrogant and the performance was pulled off perfectly. However there was little else for me to be impressed upon in the first film because I found most of the other performances to be lacking character and emotion, the story really did not do anything for me and the action and special effects sequences went on too long and became a big part of the story, whereas I prefer more background on the characters, the hero and the villains. It was an okay film, but not great. I wasn't sure how I would like Iron Man 2 after my disappointment with the first outing of what is sure to become a series, but I actually liked Iron Man 2 better than the first film, a lot better. First of all, I found the acting a lot better in this one from everybody and the newcomers were really good also. Secondly the film gave us more of a back story to the characters and villain and I found it got more personal this second time around. Instead of just non stop action and explosions there were more scenes letting us know these characters better and I found that to be far superior and more interesting than non stop excitement from the special effects department. I also found this version to have more humour in it and there are certainly some smiles and chuckles coming your way and it made the film a lot more fun and entertaining for me than the first one. I think fans of the first one will likely be a bit disappointed with this version and the reviews tend to reflect this because it is not as action packed as the first film and I have also read complaints that people had of the writer and director trying to put too much into one two hour film. There is quite a bit going on this time around, but I did not find that the film suffered because of it. Instead, I found it gave us more to look at and think about and was a pleasant alternative to the non stop action scenes I mentioned above. The writing I also liked a lot better because it gave us more time with the characters, had a more interesting story and because some of the one liners and humour that I mentioned were in the film earlier. These last few years it seems that most superhero films have been compared to 2008's The Dark Knight because of what a great film it was and I would have to agree. I don't think you will get too many that will get the genre right and give us as interesting a look at it as in The Dark Knight, but we may yet still be surprised. Iron Man 2 while I am giving it the same rating as The Dark Knight, is not as good as The Dark Knight, but as a film in this genre, I do think it is one of the better ones. The Dark Knight was more gruesome, dark and disturbing while Iron Man 2 is definitely lighter and more kid friendly than The Dark Knight and is not as much into the development or psyches of the characters. Iron Man 2 knows this and more, or less just wants you to have a good time watching it and leave feeling entertained. For those goals Iron Man 2 succeeded and then some.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Fun Filler Episode in an Iron Man Show,"Continuing the expanding saga, Marvel Studios takes the next steps in fleshing out the MCU with Iron Man 2. Having secured a period of World Peace since his big reveal, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) finds himself dealing with a crisis of health, as well as some skeletons crawling out of his fathers closet. While the origin film felt massive within its personal scope, the sequel feels quite small and inconsequential, akin to a filler episode of a television show. Though this film is a ton of fun, the story in between the fun are what make this a bit more lackluster than the previous. Whiplash (Mickey Rourke) comes off a generic villain, being nothing more than a glorified lackey for the show stealer, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). Being the reflection of what Tony Stark once could have been, Hammer is witty, charming, and delightfully arrogant. Through any of the boring moments, Rockwell's performance is the best part of the film, outside of RDJ. Though we get the introduction of Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) & Don Cheadle's James Rhodes, they are mostly featured in inconsequential roles, just helping push the plot across. With little major physical threat, it's odd to say that the action sequences are some of the most memorable and entertaining in the early MCU. With the racetrack scene, the birthday blast, and the StarkExpo confrontation, each fight brought in a unique and compelling aspect, which made them genuinely exciting to watch. Although it isn't perfect, Iron Man 2 is a wildly fun ride, well worth its more forgettable facets.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
IRON MAN 2 - A Colossal Letdown,"Summer blockbuster season always brings with it at least one big disappointment. This year's comes right up front – and what a disappointment it is. IRON MAN 2 is a classic sequel in the worst sense: we've got more villains, more heroes, more money in the budget, and none of it amounts to an experience that comes even close to that of its predecessor, which stood out in 2008 as smart, effervescent counter-programming in the summer dominated by the dour DARK KNIGHT.The problems with IRON MAN 2 are bone deep, but they manifest themselves everywhere on the surface. While the first film focused neatly on Tony and his development from careless cad to honorable hero, this sequel gives him nowhere to go, and at some point in the filming/editing, director Jon Favreau must have realized this; hence, his new movie's many secondary characters and subplots receive a disproportionate share of screen time here. Tony is all but discarded as a dynamic character – and it becomes very clear very early that without the original's central arc (and I ain't talking arc reactor, hiyo,) there's really not much novel about this franchise.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Rusty,"""If you could make God bleed, people will cease to believe in Him."" Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke)It's apt to say Iron Man 2 is bleeding, but we know it won't be money. Rather it is that lifeblood of originality in story and dialogue characteristic of the original Marvel comic adaptation absent here. Remaining are pyrotechnics and gymnastics worthy of straight-to-video productions. I'm being sardonic. Obviously, the effects are going to be first-rate; it's just that the story is so burdened with sub plots that the original story seems now to be minimalist with its dramatic emphasis on character development and relationships rather than quips and effects.It is mostly visual mayhem while Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) keeps the government at bay as it tries to co-opt his invention and Russian scientist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) challenges Iron Man with some very electric strategy. No less a threat is Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), an industrialist wimp with the old domination ambitions accompanied by an unhealthy dislike for the likable Stark.The limitations are plentiful: very few lines for Rourke, an Oscar winner who deserves more than a few Russian words, several grunts, and silver teeth. The plot has too many strands and too few appearances of Iron Man. Perhaps just as disappointing is the underuse of Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman/Natasha Romanoff, whose Catwoman-like costume demands more eye time and whose acting chops, like Rourke's, probably lie in the editing trash bin.The relationship between Stark and talented assistant Pepper Potts goes to a new level, not a welcome development for this minimalist reviewer who prefers the cool of a professional relationship to a second-rate passion. And that feeling is pretty much my take on this first summer blockbuster: easy on the eyes but starvation for the brain.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Overcrowded, But Doesn't Deserve All the Hate","In preparation for the upcoming Captain America: Civil War film, I've decided to go back and reexamine Iron Man and Cap's previous entries that I haven't reviewed.Don't get me wrong, there's plenty wrong with Iron Man 2. But after re-watching for about the 3rd or 4th time, I couldn't help but enjoy the hell out of the film. It's nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be. It's action packed, filled with timely humor, and great character development, even if it does have a pretty weak villain.In the next line of villains with the same abilities as the hero, Mickey Rourke stars as Ivan Vanko/Whiplash, a man with his mind set on vengeance for what the Starks did to his family. It's hard to ever get truly invested in Vanko as a character. Marvel really struggles with its villains, and Whiplash is another example of that. However, it may be more of a case in which Rourke simply didn't care about giving the character any depth at all.It's even more frustrating because Sam Rockwell is so good as Justin Hammer. He fit the witty humor of the Iron Man films impeccably, and doesn't take himself too seriously. If only the focus would have been on Hammer instead of Rourke.The Pepper and Tony relationship is better than ever in Iron Man 2 as Pepper is introduced as the new CEO of Stark Industries with Tony sidelined with other issues. I've said it before but I'll say it again, Pepper and Tony are one of the only superhero relationships that actually work, and it's once again handled extremely well in this sequel.Rhodey is back as the reluctant best friend to Tony, though this time, Don Cheadle suits up as War Machine. I didn't mind Terrence Howard's portrayal, but I think at this point, I couldn't see anyone fitting more nicely alongside Downey Jr. Their pairing make for some of the best action of the film.One of the film's few problems lies with the inclusion of so many different story lines, and a few shoehorned in characters. Scarlett Johansson makes a grand first impression as Black Widow, but she didn't really need to be there. However, her scenes alongside Jon Favreau are very memorable.Sure, there are quite a few unnecessary elements of the film's plot, but Iron Man 2 is still an enjoyable and highly re-watchable film.

"Good, not great","Let me say it straight – Iron Man 2 is good, not great. I definitely liked it but nowhere as much as the first film.Specifically, Iron Man 2's plot does not seem that interesting and as such the narrative relied on special effects for impact in certain scenes. No matter how fantastic or bombastic action and effects could get, they just don't help the storytelling very much. The new antagonists – Justin Hammer and Whiplash – are both weak and not compelling. They both pale in comparison to Obadiah Stane (brilliantly played by Jeff Bridges) in terms of personality and antagonism. Don Cheadle as Col. Rhodes/War Machine never felt like he belonged in the film and the more he appeared on screen, the more I wished Terence Howard was back.I also felt that the comedy in this film seemed forced. While the first flick made me laugh or smile, the sequel did not amuse me very much. While Robert Downey, Jr.'s performance as Tony Stark is worth praise, I find it weird that Stark now seemed more psychotica far change from the conflicted man he was before.Aside from Downey's stellar performance, the other big redeeming value was the film's adaptation of character elements from the critically acclaimed Iron Man comic storyline Demon in a Bottle. In that storyline, Stark was portrayed with an addiction to liquor and this concept was nicely portrayed in Iron Man 2. Expect to see Robert Downey, Jr. drink and drink a lot.Having waited two years for Iron Man 2, I felt a bit disappointed. I tried to like the film. It is not a bad movie, but more of a less compelling continuation. The distraction scenes (leading to the Avengers) and the improved action scenes simply could not lift the film's weak story. Adding insult to injury, the final battle with Whiplash is totally unsatisfying to watch.As long as you don't set your expectations very high, Iron Man 2 can be enjoyable. Clearly its presentation is different from the first film, and that made it less enjoyable for me.

"Fun and Legacy, Too","In the noisy gaudy opening of ""Iron Man 2"" billionaire bad boy Tony Stark arrives at his Stark Expo in the Iron Man suit. Once removed from his body armor, Robert Downey Jr. as Tony admits, ""It's all about legacy."" Amidst the fun, high energy and stupid plot line, legacy does resonate as a poignant theme. I agree with A.O. Scott, that casting overcomes a lot in ""Iron Man 2""—I think I liked the movie more than he did. Robert Downey Jr. is awesome. And Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko provides what every hero story requires: a formidable villain. Director Jon Favreau is smart in never taking the movie too seriously, letting his actors morph and evolve. Favreau provides some spectacular action and visuals. The Monte Carlo Grand Prix where Vanko attacks Stark is stunning and heroic high drama.Downey is amazing in carrying off such a wide-band character in Tony. His Tony even cops to being a text book narcissist. Downey is one of the gifted actors, whom we can discern what is going on in his mind—through his eyes. He brings a crisp intelligence, brashness, and sobering humanity here. We learn that the palladium core that keeps Tony alive is rapidly poisoning his blood and killing him. At the same time S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury (cool Samuel L. Jackson) wants Tony to uncover his father Howard's legacy, and solve the mysteries of his heart—on also a more profound level. Tony confesses his estranged relationship with his Father—""He never told me that he loved me."" But in his research Tony watches a message from his Dad. He says proudly, ""You are going to change the world what has always been and always will be my greatest creation is you, Tony"" From then on I was into the movie.""Iron Man 2"" may not be a good as the first, although it has a huge upside. Scarlett Johansson is hot as S.H.I.E.L.D. ""triple agent"" Natasha Romanoff. She looks stunning in tight leather and performing Jeff Imada designed fight choreography. Beautiful and sprite Gwyneth Paltrow reprises her role of Tony's worried assistant Pepper Potts—who Tony appoints as new CEO of Stark Industries. Tony and Pepper are so in love with each other. Will they ever figure this out by the end of the movie? You have powerful actors Downey and Rourke squaring off. Rourke is menacing and dangerous—he plays it dead on. In a subdued interrogation scene Vanko tells Tony, ""If you make God bleed, people will cease to believe in him."" Vanko is out to avenge his own father—defending his own legacy. Sam Rockwell nails the pompous and annoying Justin Hammer, Tony's industrial competitor. Gary Shandling is dead pan genius as the Senator, who demands Tony turnover Iron Man. To which Tony reminds, ""I have successfully privatized world peace.""""Iron Man 2"" is visually stunning with the spectacular battle with the Vanko built drones at the story arc. It is also a lot of fun as self destructive Tony in Iron Man suit dances to the late Adam Goldstein's mixes. ""Iron Man 2"" is an action packed, fun, and funny mixed bag. It's not all that coherent. It's engrossing mainly because of Robert Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke, and its surprising story of legacy in spite of itself. And that works as well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another Phase 1 meh,"One of MCU's lower tier movies. I guess they were still trying to find their footing.The great things about the first one still carries on, Tony Stark can't be a more perfect casting. The Senate sequence is a great piece of introduction but the movie goes downhill as we progress.The villain Whiplash isn't that great but Sam Rockwell shines is some scenes with his charisma. A great introduction to Black Widow but she is done much better in Winter Soldier.Jon Favreau lacked a lot compare to the first one, mostly because of rushed productions for Avengers( everything pays off). The climatic scenes are better than first one but still forgettable action-sequence.I liked the small world building parts of Caps shield prototype, Coulson going to New Mexico and Nick Fury's Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement and Logistics Division.It felt cramped between both a sequel to Iron Man 1 ( consequences of past actions) and prequel to Avengers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not The Worst Night I've Ever Had At The Cinema - how's that for praise?,"I was such a big fan of the original movie and had been looking forward to this sequel for a while. Sadly this effort just didn't live up to expectations.That is not to say the movie is terrible or boring but it just missed something.Downey Jr, Rourke, Rockwell, Paltrow and Johansson performing together should have added up to something great but unfortunately it just added up to something that was OK.Hard to identify a single flaw but I got the impression that the film makers started off with a project that was just too ambitious (a cynic might describe it as a project that was too poorly defined).Some of the plot leaps, clunky dialogue and vanishing characters made me think a lot of material had been cut and gaps had been filled with hasty re-shoots.Go and see this by all means. You will probably enjoy it but it really could have been so much more enjoyable.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Lacks the finesse of the first installment but Delivers !,"The brilliance of the first installment, the direction of favreau, inclusion of Theroux (of Tropic Thunder fame) for the script and the charisma of Downey Jr. created huge expectations for this sequel. The film delivers in almost all departments but Iron man 2 lacks what everyone is mentioning as ""that something"".With a cast that includes rourke, rockwell, Cheadle and downey himself, the movie never slackens. Downey is at his best as Tony stark and Paltrow is even better than the first installment. Johannson is just eye candy. she has a few good action sequences but does not have any major role to play in the movie. Samuel Jackson appears to remind us of The Avengers here and there. The dialogues are well written. The action sequences are brilliant. Lauri Gaffin's sets are gorgeous.Theroux could have sharpened the script here and there. A few complexities refrain us from regarding this in the same level as Iron Man 1. Nevertheless it is a treat to watch. Go with an open mind and forget Iron Man 1 for a while and you will enjoy it.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not bad for a Skell,Robert Downey Jr. is again brilliant as Tony Stark in Iron Man 2. While not as fresh or interesting as the first Iron Man this movie has much to recommend. The pacing is good and the characters are brought to life with some very good acting.Gwyneth Paltrow reprises her role has Pepper Potts and has a love/loathing relationship with Tony. Again there is a list of bad guys Ivan Vanko(Mickey Rourke)who plays the main antagonist. His main beef with Tony is that his father was cheated by Tonies father. The other bad guy is Tonies industrial rival Justin Hammer(Sam Rockwell) who wants to get his hands on either Ivan(who has the knowledge to build an Iron Man suit) or one of Tonies Iron man suits to sell to the military. There is also a secret organization the Avengers headed by Colonel Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson)who sends Natalie Rushman(Scarlett Johansson)to protect him. This is the basic set up of the film.What works well in this movie are good special effects and solid acting on all parts. The fact that Iron Man is vulnerable and actually getting sick from the poisons of being Iron man makes Tony act with abandonment which helps move the film along. Some of the disappointing parts of the film is that transitions seem unnatural and some of the charm that endeared us to Tony in the first film.Overall grade B.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Too Much Iron,"Just a few years ago the careers of Robert Downy Jr. and Mickey Rourke looked like the smoldering aftermath of one of the explosive battles in Iron man 2. Now they're together staring in one of the biggest movies of the summer. The problem is biggest does not always mean best.Downy reprises his role as weapons mogul Tony Stark. We pick up the story after Stark announces he is Iron man. Soon we are pulled along with him as he's stretched every direction by the government, friends and enemies. As he's spiraling out of control he becomes somewhat of an ass but Downey's irresistible charm pulls you through.Rourke joins the cast as a disgruntled Russian baddie who invents his own suit and weapons manufacturer and rival to stark, Justin hammer (Sam Rockwell) finances his operation. Rourke steals almost every scene he's in with little dialogue. His presents on the screen is commanding. Rockwell is solid, as Downys smarmy know it all rival. But in the end the show belongs to Tony Stark. Downey keeps you hanging on every word with the help of Justin Theroux's dialogue. There is sharp wit and bite with every snarky comment. The movie oozes humor and it saves the picture.While Theroux wrote great dialogue, his story suffers from a bloated plot. Too many new and uninteresting characters such as the members of S.H.E.I.L.D. put a speed bump in the middle of the movie throwing of the pacing a bit. Sam Jackson and Scarlett Johansson give wooden performances that take away screen time from the Downy, Paltrow would be romance and the more interesting plot line of Starks daddy issues. I understand that they are trying to set up an Avengers movie but not at the cost of Iron Man.The action is bigger and louder as you would expect in a summer sequel, but is unnecessary. Its always gonna be more fun to see one dastardly bad guy pummel the hero, than whole mess of not so dastardly ones get ripped to shreds. The smaller action scenes do work but the climax leaves the movie down flat. In the end Iron Man 2 leaves you wanting a little more man and a lot less iron.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
much more action... less story... still great,"If you like movies with more action and less time being wasted in developing a back-story and detailed character build-ups then this movie is definitely for you.Fans of the comics will probably enjoy the movie more than those of us who are not already familiar with the new set of characters. But things fall into place as the movie develops so it doesn't take away too much from the overall enjoyment.The actors are all pretty good, Mickey Rourke does very well and so does Scarlet Johansson. Don Cheadle seems a little out of place in the beginning (not because of his acting, more because I really liked Terrence Howard in the first film) but as the movie develops he starts fitting the role much better. By the end of the film I didn't miss Terrence so much. Samuel L Jackson could have done with some more screen time, but I feel that they are developing him for the next installment in the franchise.Overall, the film was still Great! With a mix of the humor and fantastic special effects that made the first film so good.Go watch this movie with an open mind, expecting lots of action, some good moments of humor (there were lots of ladies sitting near and around us laughing out loud at many parts of the film so they obviously found it to be pretty good, as did the guys).Everyone's going to be talking about Iron Man 2 and everyone will have their opinions about what they liked or disliked about it (compared to the first installment).

Doesn't hinder the potential for Iron Man 3,"It is harsh, inappropriate, and perhaps a bit exaggerated to compare this sequel to the likes of the third installment in the Spider-Man franchise, but I couldn't help but think of how both just seem to deflate any momentum their potential sagas have going. The difference is that while ""Spider-Man 3"" was over done and downright laughable at times, ""Iron Man 2""is just simply... done. There is little to hate about the film, but not much to really like.This installment lacks the episodic quality most superhero films require. There is too much downtime and too few points of interest to allow for a wide enough landscape to justify the two hours worth of material. After the exhilarating sense of discovery we experienced on the first film, the sequel needs some emotional draw and high risk scenarios. By the time you reach the super charged final battle sequence it is simply too little, too late.The film also seems to assume that everyone who saw the original installment stayed past the credits to see Samuel L. Jackson's cameo. The introduction of Nick Fury is nonexistent and it comes off as mildly silly to have this character with an eye-patch (however cool it may look) suddenly come into the scene if you are unfamiliar with the background, which for the most part, I am. The beauty of the original was its accessibility to the masses who aren't familiar with the lore of Iron Man, but this installment lacks that same quality.The menace that was Obadiah in the original is not given an adequate replacement. Mickey Rourke serves well as Whiplash but the role is reduced to a minimal two main sequences. Justin Hammer is played well by Sam Rockwell but his character's antics and goals are kind of silly and don't really raise the stakes very high. Also, isn't Natasha suppose to become Black Widow or something? Is there not suppose to be a hint that she's going to go through a transformation of some sort? I'm not even sure who Black Widow is but I kind of expected to get some sort of nod in that general direction. That disappointed me. I know nothing about the lore of the comics, so forgive me if I had inappropriate expectations.It's a worthy enough sequel that doesn't carry the franchise forward very much, but also doesn't really hinder the potential for an Iron Man 3.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 2: Satisfying!,"'Iron Man 2' has been the most anticipated movie of May, and yet the year 2010. So many action scenes have been awaited in this movie including the appearance of 'War Machine', 'Whiplash', 'Black Widow' and not to forget, new armors of 'Iron Man'.Action scenes have been the most anticipated thing in this movie. Too bad, the movie didn't put a lot of fighting scenes. The fighting scenes are only a few and they are pretty short. In around 124 minutes of duration, I have expected around at least 40 minutes of those to be fighting scenes.All the visual effects and the story are not really a problem. The blasts, explosions and damage, they were pretty perfect. The details were also satisfying. Only fighting scenes were the real missing things.The fighting scene at the end was great. I thoroughly enjoyed it especially when they're up against 'Whiplash'. But, the fight was way too short. There were like only a few moves they did and done. It needs more action scenes. In total, there were like only four short fighting scenes.In summary, 'Iron Man 2' was satisfying but needs a lot more fighting scenes. But, the movie was still great. 8 stars for 'Iron Man 2'.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Iron Man 2:  A Few More Suits, No Additional Substance","Iron Man 2, much like the original, does a lot of things right. The special effects, the charisma, the characters, and the technology are all top notch. Watching Tony Stark play around in his massive, billion-dollar man cave makes every man/boy reconsider what he's doing with his life and why he didn't get into weaponry. So what's the problem? All the good stuff happens in the first 60-minutes, with the following 60 leaving not just a little, but a lot to be desired.This film opens up with the it's new villain, Ivan Vanko, played by Mickey Rourke, a Russian physicist hell bent on not only destroying Tony Stark, but also his reputation and his enterprise. By creating a device that sends electric volts through cable whips attached to his back and arms, he not only gives this film a boost of fresh air, but he also creates one of the most unique villains to date. CGI aside, this dude looks completely crazy, completely frightening, and the most impressive part: completely real.The rest of the story contains all the key characteristics of the original Iron Man, but makes them bigger, more exciting, and more out of control. The cars, the women, the style, the suits; it's all there. It doesn't feel old, per say, but it does feel a little outdated. My biggest concern, lies not in the fact that the film isn't innovative, it's that the film doesn't quite innovate enough. They start with an interesting villain, and turn him into something that's been done previously in Iron Man before; a man who creates another suit. They create Iron Man clones that don't do anything other than die at the push of a button or the shot of a gun. Iron Man and Tony Stark are still pushing boundaries, but everything around them is stuck in place. Where can the series go next? That's the exciting part.There's a lot of talk in this film about the Avengers, the future installment of the Marvel franchise that features Ant Man, Wasp, Thor, Iron Man, and Captain America. Now whether or not these characters make it into the film of the same name is TBD, but it's safe to say that Iron Man is definitely going to play some part in piecing this film together and it might be exactly what this franchise needs to bring back the action and the energy we once thought that it had.If you're a guy, you're going to check out Iron Man 2 no matter what I say. To that, I say go ahead, see it for yourself. It's a high budget action adventure film about a man in an iron suit. It can't be that bad right? Correct. It's not that bad, it's just not quite what it could be for the feature length, only about one half.Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Marvel Comics' ""Man of Steel,"" um, ""Iron,"" is back","One of the many great pleasures of watching 2008's ""Iron Man"" was that it allowed to some degree for star Robert Downey, Jr., playing billionaire industrialist Tony Stark, who moonlighted and eventually revealed to the world his secret identity as the armored superhero Iron Man, to exorcise the many demons from his lonely, drug-fueled days in the annals of Hollywood Hell. Stark, of course, has in the past dealt with debilitating bouts of alcoholism, so this role would have allowed Robert Downey, Jr. to face any remaining demons from his past. It is this deep personal struggle that has made Tony Stark/Iron Man one of the more fascinatingly introspective characters in the Marvel Comics Universe of superheroes.But whatever meditations these movies could have had in dealing with the harrowing perils of drug addiction gets lost in the bang-bang pacing, action and special effects of the latest Hollywood superhero blockbuster to boast spectacular visuals and top-notch performances but lacking any real depth or content. Actor/director Jon Favreau is quickly becoming a favorite in Hollywood, especially with the way he's handling his work on the ""Iron Man"" movies, and he proves his mettle, regardless of the lack of thematic complexity or depth that they could have had, with this sequel ""Iron Man 2."" And while I would have personally much more enjoyed the subject of Stark's internal struggles with alcoholism rather than his external struggles with the U.S. government, I guess what we get here will have to do for now.While less skillful and entertaining than its 2008 predecessor, I personally feel that I somehow enjoyed this one a lot more, perhaps because it features a more-fleshed-out supporting role from Stark's best friend Lt. Col. Jim Rhodes (Don Cheadle, having fully replaced Terrence Howard from the previous film), who of course later dawns a powered armor suit of his own to become the awesomely bad-ass War Machine. And the movie has a killer soundtrack by those Aussie bad boys AC/DC.This time out, Stark has really let his arrogance get to his head, and this is something that Downey, Jr. really pushes past its limits to become cinematic gold. He has effectively saved the world from certain doom so many times in the past that he has also effectively ""privatized world peace,"" and the government wants a piece of his technology because he has so quickly and so suddenly made them look incompetent.All that's about to change when the villainous Russian physicist Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) shows up on Tony's home turf one day and challenges him to a duel. Vanko is especially miffed at Stark because he believes that Stark's father stole the technology that he developed with Vanko's father and had him deported back to Russia to cover his tracks. So Ivan, possessing blueprints for Stark's technology to exact his revenge, develops some nifty little weapons of his own to become the whip-wielding super-villain Whiplash.On the home front, meanwhile, Stark's ticker is deathly ill and feels that his time is running out, and he hands over control of Stark Industries to his would-be love interest Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). And just as he does this, another character is introduced, Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johannson), who also hides a few secrets of her own since she is also the lethal spy/secret agent Black Widow.A lot of stuff goes on in ""Iron Man 2"" and there's the main problem (other than that other issue I mentioned earlier about Stark's battles with alcoholism getting the shaft here): a lot goes on and the movie kind of feels crammed as a result. Rourke is a fascinating presence whenever he's on the screen, which unfortunately is not very much, but I enjoyed his scenes the most, especially since he comes under the yoke of Stark's rival weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). Johannson's Black Widow also gets shafted as well, since she doesn't really become a big player in all this superhero stuff until the film's action-packed, 20-minute climax. And at least Cheadle's War Machine is made useful in the film before (note that I said ""before"") he and Iron Man have to go to work as a team to defeat a newly powered-up Whiplash (which is a little anti-climatic and a bit short, to say the least).Am I nit-picking some things? Probably. But the reason we keep coming back is because of the action, special effects, and Robert Downey, Jr. as Marvel Comics' Man of Steel... Iron. He's utterly perfect for this role: he's arrogant, greedy, narcissistic, and drops more biting one-liners here than Arnold Schwarzenegger ever did in his prime (not knocking the great Schwarzenegger here, but you get my point). But he's a hero, and that all that matters in ""Iron Man 2.""9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's not about us. It's about legacy.,"After the release of Iron Man, people were ready for another type of superhero genre, not goofy and campy but also not serious and brooding. Iron Man helped this into Hollywood and the world, so Iron Man 2 had to continue the run and prove that it can do the same things but still be a good movie. And boy, did it...not.It has the good elements of Iron Man: RDJ's performance, humor and entertaining action. However, there are the negatives in this movie too. The villain is not even different from the first Iron Man. Sure, it is technically two people this time with Justin Hammer and Ivan Vanko, but their personalities are the same as Obadiah Stane. Hammer is a billionaire weapons developer who wants Tony's tech and tries to replicate it. Vanko is a vindictive man with ties to Tony's father, Howard, who fights Tony in the end with a much larger suit of armor. So no real difference except that it was split into two people. There is also the fact that it tries so hard to set up so much, such as the Avengers, introducing Shield, War Machine and Black Widow. That is a lot to cover and it doesn't leave time for a good story.RDJ continues to be great as Tony Stark. I like that they explored his alcohol problem as it just looks further into his insecurities. There was also the scene where Tony watches a prerecorded video by his father, Howard, saying that his son is his greatest creation. To me that was pretty powerful. Kudos to John Slattery for acting like a tool like Tony, but still being able to loving and adoring of his son.The humor in this movie is also very good, especially for RDJ. The Senate committee hearing is really funny as Tony is just blowing every question off and acting entitled, which isn't unusual for him but RDJ makes it look so easy and it let's us like Stark even more.The action too is very good, including the fight in Monaco, Rhodey v Stark and the final battle against the Hammer Drones. I will say that the sound effects used for the suits moving was very distracting as it was so clear how much CGI was used. The suits used in this movie were really incredible such as the suitcase suit, War Machine's suit and Tony's final suit.In this movie, there is so much they have to set up for future movies, mostly the Avengers. It very clearly gets in the way of the story and while it is good to know what could be, it was very time consuming.I will also say that the product placement in this film was insane such as Oracle, Elon Musk's cameo, and all the other products shown at the Stark Expo.While it is an entertaining movie, there is so much that gets in the way that really distracts from the movie itself.+ RDJ + Cool, new suits + Fun action scenes and humor - Rehashed villains - Too much setup for futureFinal Score: 7.2/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
How many times can I write boring to complete the ten line rule,"It is 111 if you are not using spaces. This movies was without question the most boring movie I have seen in a long time. And, I invited my friend to come with me since he doesn't go to the movies often and now he is mad at me because he hated it also. Now, don't get me wrong, I am thoroughly an Iron Man fan and read the comic most of my young life. But I think the movie was a movie designed to further the franchise. The setup for the Avengers is now strongly in place as they spent a very large part of the movie harping the Avengers. It took almost two hours before we even get to see the suit do anything worth watching. They spent more time showcasing Scarlet fighting than they did with Iron Man. Robert Downey also proves that he just gets more irritating as he gets older. That and whoever said Jon Favreau and Gwynneth Paltrow are stars should be put on trial. The four main characters just do not go together and the fact that they took out the best performer from the first one - Terence, is quite sad. I like Don Cheadle as much as the next guy but he doesn't even come close to making Rhodes believable.

Robocop without blood spill,"I don't like comparing very much, every movie is a new world for itself, but in this case I have to mourn this sequel. Of course it is a decent piece of Hollywood popcorn cinema, this kind of pictures always succeeds in the western world, like Bollywood movies in India. You have to leave your brain outside (if you own one) and you know what you have to expect. I for myself tend to celebrate this expend as a therapy to escape the real and dull world, and my children have phun. But Iron Man 2 left me quite disappointed. If I wouldn't have known the first part, that maybe wouldn't be the case.But now I misseda good and fresh new story instead of an hours-filling struggle to entertain me with the obvioustension and dramatic highlights instead of those simplistic chases and fightsmore dimensional characters and especially charm like in Iron Man 1actors and a director who really enjoy their workthe begun love story at a somewhere noticeable level continuedIron man 2 isn't much more than a rehash of its predecessor. Number one mostly successfully tried to keep me interested, say, with Tony Stark's imprisonment, with the love story (remember the scene where she have to fix the power unit in his chest ? - nothing like this in here !), the machination of his father's friend, and so on.The present sequel is far too clean and free of any obstacles for the Hero's final victory. It has no highlights except the presence of Mickey Rourke, whom I wish that his career now may have taken a new start. To say that the most impressing things in this movie were his old-style glasses and his big fingernails, may sound weird but that's it. Although I found especially his character not as delightful as he could be with a better script or a better direction.But always looking for the box office eradicates seemingly every creativity, since the rules say 'take no risk, but always the money'.The most ridiculous appearance was for me one-eyed Nick Fury's with his Avenger organization. That Avenger thing may be a part of America's comic culture, but it did nothing good for the story except giving an explanation why a former model (Scarlett Johanssen, beautiful and seductive, outperforming bland Gwyneth Paltrow at every scene they commonly have) should work at a department of Stark Industries. Samuel L. Jackson's and Scarlett Johanssens's talents are both wasted at most of their screen time, which is, in his case, fortunately, not for long.My conclusion is that this is a ready-to-wear movie not made by caring authors or artists but concept creators and financial analysts. There is no dirt, no danger. There is no chemistry between anybody, because there is no scene for it. There are no highlights, no risky scenes, no surprises. Nothing to remember, but the box office performance.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A fantastic continuation of the series.,"Everything about this movie is extremely well done. The sound design, the acting, the effects, and everything else is great. There are only a few things that were kinda bad in this movie, but they don't really ruin it. Potts (the assistant) is more annoying than she was in the first one. She was already annoying in the first one, but now she's got more screen time and screaming. Some of the action is a bit boring (people are fighting with the same technology again) and some of the dialogue is a bit predictable. This movie is extremely entertaining. Its not as good as the first one, but its definitely worth watching. There is an end-credits scene. Its a teaser for ""Thor"" which has already released. Thor is a much worse movie and I wouldn't really recommend it. Basically, this is a great movie that's slightly worse than the original. Go watch it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A sequel that could have been much better,"Coming off of one of the better Marvel films to date, Iron Man 2 is an OK film, but I expected a lot better. With Robert Downey, Jr., arguably one of the more popular actors in the world today, in the starring role, why wasn't the writing up to par this time? Yes, it may be said that the first Iron Man revamped Downey, Jr's career, it was notably because the writing was up to his performance, which was good, by the way, and the sequel is more worried about being an action movie and introducing new villains, allies, and trying to be funnier, which eventually becomes one of the more tiresome elements of the film. That being said, the film's action is quite satisfying, especially the last scene with the kind of robot war that happens. Unfortunately, it's the only good one. Otherwise, the party scene is reminiscent of Spider-Man 3's dance scene, and the Justin Hammer character is unnecessary and unfunny, but the film hits a few good spots, and it recovers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I thought the sequel to Iron Man was a blast,"This film did almost the same amount of business as the first film, but a lot of people consider it an inferior film. I am not one of those people, I actually think it is just as good as the first film. The first film had a bit more polish, but this one had more bang for your buck as the last action sequence in this film has more action than all of the cation scenes in the first film put together. They did recast Rhodes in this film substituting Don Cheadle for Terrance Howard, but quite frankly I thought it was an improvement. Cheadle just has a better presence than Howard and though they recast the role because Howard wanted more money, I think it worked in favor of the studio because Cheadle is a better actor. All the other primary players are accounted for as Robert Downey Jr. is back as Tony Stark/Iron Man and Gwyneth Paltrow is back as Pepper Potts. The two do great as a very eccentric pair and I thought Mickey Rourke as the villain was an improvement over Bridges in the first film. I just am not seeing what others saw that make them say that this film is a worse film than the first one.The story has a man in Russia with ties to Tony's father blaming the Stark family for all the misery that he and his now dead father have had to endure. He designs his own reactor and a pair of whip like weapons. Meanwhile, Tony is having problems as the U.S. government wants the Iron Man suit and the reactor in his chest is killing him at a rapid rate. So, thinking his time is limited, Tony goes crazy trying to live every moment as if it was his last. This leads to him to giving away his possessions, wearing his Iron Man suit to his birthday party and driving a race car. It is during the race that he first comes face to face with the new villain Ivan Vanko. Vanko is stopped by Iron Man, but his stay in prison is shortened when Justin Hammer, who is desperately trying to design his own Iron Man suit springs him in the hopes Vanko can create him the suit he yearns for. Tony soon gets information on a way to save himself and it all culminates at an all out battle at the newly opened Stark expo.The movie to me was fun as they brought back most of the cast and as I said, I thought the one they had to recast was an improvement. Also, introduced in this film is Natasha Romanoff who gets to showcase her skills a bit in this film. A lot more than Hawkeye would get to showcase his in his first appearance in the first Thor film. I enjoyed the Iron Man suitcase armor in the first fight with Vanko and I liked how Vanko looked in that fight as well. Something primal as a man with just a couple of whips and slight enhancers on the body trying to challenge the hero.Once again, not sure why this one is thought of as inferior. Tony was dying, that is why he reverted a bit to the jerky out of control self. He was just trying to enjoy his last days. I heard a lot of complaining that the final fight with Vanko was not long enough, but that was only one portion of the final action scene. Before that you had Iron Man being chased by drones while Romanoff was kicking butt at Hammer industries and then you had Iron Man and War Machine fighting against the horde of drone robots. Like I stated earlier, this final action scene was long and had a lot going on. The humor was still good and there was still heart to it. To me, this film is just as good as the original and the action was actually better.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Goes Beyond the Original,"What can I say? Jon Favreau can never disappoint. Whether he's funny as an actor or artistic as a director. He's a master of his craft and definitely found his niche.

From being sweet and hilarious in Heart and Souls, to sarcastic and witty with an edge of drama in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang to perfecting his ability in playing Tony Stark. Robert is versatile and can go beyond some of the other great actors.Gwyneth Paltrow is the perfect female to play Pepper Potts, as seen in the first film. She's funny, she's brainy, and she's sexy. She's got a beautiful face to look at and a sweet voice to hear. Her character, Pepper, takes a backseat for screen time to make room for others, but she still plays a prominent role in Iron Man's future.Samuel L. Jackson, gets a small cameo and Scarlett Johansson joins the cast as a really sexy, seductive, ass-kicking seductress who bounds to keep both Tony Stark and audiences on their toes. Don Cheadle comes along as well to play sidekick and Mickey Rourke is chilling and terrifying as villain Ivan Vanko.There's mind blowing special effects, triple the intense action sequences and give just the perfect amount of comic relief and you've got a sequel that does ten times better than the original. It's not surprising. Iron Man, wasn't bad by any means, but it just feels inferior to this. I can't imagine how it will seem when the third chapter is unveiled.Strap yourself in for a roller coaster ride of a lifetime. It's fun, it's dark, it's full of surprise and it's action packed.

Just as good as the first one.,"After seeing this movie, I thought that this one was not excellent, but just as good as the first one. It continues where Iron Man 1 left off, and introduces plenty of new characters that die-hard comic book fans will know by heart. The action never stops. Plenty of good CGI. The soundtrack is classic rock by AC/DC and there's some laughs. Comparing it to that other super hero movie of the last decade is easy....it ain't no Dark Knight but is more like Superman II. Stay after the end credits for a bonus scene. This is the best superhero movie of 2010, period.

"Weak on its own, fine as a building block of the larger series","Robert Downey Jr. reprises his star-making role from the first film, as a charmingly egotistical, but ultimately courageous superhero. The film has a terrific cast, some clever banter, and a handful of genuinely thrilling action sequences, but the story isn't as focused or compelling as that of the first film. It feels as if the filmmakers are trying too hard to win over the comparatively few fans of the comic books, but in doing so alienate, to an extent, the mainstream audience. That said, IRON MAN 2 works as an exciting summer blockbuster with wit and spectacle, but doesn't quite measure up to the original. Action violence abounds, and a few innuendos and scantily-clad females pop up as well.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 2,"Taking place six months after the first Iron Man, Iron Man 2 finds a world where Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has successfully ""privatized world peace,"" but fearing other countries getting their hands on Stark's Iron Man technology the Senate seeks to have Tony hand over the technology to the government. Also seeking to steal Stark's technology is Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) who wants to regain a weapons contract with the military. Complicating things further, a mysterious Russian physicist named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) turns up to destroy Tony Stark.Iron Man was a huge surprise when it came out in the early summer of 2008. A 2nd tier Marvel comic book, Iron Man became one of the top grossing movies of 2008, and even held it's own very well against the juggernaut that was The Dark Knight despite it's much smaller fanbase. It also resurrected Robert Downey Jr.'s career, showing that he was capable of leading a franchise despite his past mistakes, and showed that Jon Favreau was a viable action director. Since then Downey has found himself nominated for two Golden Globes winning one of them, and added yet another big action franchise to the current notch in his belt. Of course, all eyes are on Iron Man 2 to see if the movie will top it's predecessor in the expectations department, so how does it hold up.In my opinion, Iron Man 2 equals it's predecessor. The second installment of Iron Man is funnier than the original, and it ups the ante on the action from the first movie as well. What really makes the movie though, is not the action, but the characterizations. Fleshing out Stark's narcissism as well as his inabilities to deal with his emotions opens new doors into the character. Favreau and new writer to the series Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunderdo a great job of handling a large cast that would normally sink most other comic book franchises.The casting in this movie is superb even if it seems jarring to see so many actors and actresses playing characters that aren't typical for them. Apart from The Spirit and The Island, Scarlett Johansson hasn't played an outright action fueled character, but she equips herself admirably to play the part of a believable martial arts trained heroine. Don Cheadle does a great job taking over the role of Rhodey from Terrence Howard, and even tops his predecessor. Sam Rockwell does a superb job as Stark's rival, and a man who tries his hardest to be as iconic as Tony Stark, but fails miserably on all counts. Mickey Rourke steals nearly every scene he's in, though, as Russian physicist Ivan Vanko. I was never sure if I would be able to buy him as a Russian, but the work he put into researching for the character definitely paid off.On the downside though, sometimes it feels as though there's too much of a rush to get from one point to the next. Scenes feel as though they move to the next before they're truly done playing out. Unfortunately, this is one of the issues of having such a large cast that needs to have proper screen time to flesh out the characters. To add to that, the second half of the film is a bit derivative of other action films. While the film may do a great job of going in a different direction than other comic book films by outing it's central character and performing a character study on a man who thrives on his popularity in that position, but in the last act of the movie it falls into the same trap as other action movies with an ending that can be cliché.All in all, I highly recommend this movie, especially if you like movies based on comic books and if you like the first Iron Man. Franchises like Iron Man, the current Batman series, and Kick-Ass set a new benchmark for comic book movies and action movies in general. With great action, acting, characterization, and originality these movies have moved beyond their genres to capture something that extends beyond it's core audience.4.5/5",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Iron Man 2 is most definitely Iron Man's superior. It ups the comedy and action while simultaneously introducing new ""Avengers"" characters.

The meat of the story is rather bare bones, the Russian baddie dithers, corporate fiend Justin Hammer has a comedic way about him that's distracting than creative.
Tony behaves in an eccentric way, acceptable if the psychological impact of his reasons were explored more.
Bare bones, there is hardly any real development of a plot, meandering dialog. Nor does it attempt to be a pebble in the steam that breaks cliche in even a small way, take the Russian's vanilla portrayal.Thanks for reading my first ever review.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Loses its way in the middle, but brings it back in style","In Iron Man 2 Tony Stark is dealing with high pressure from the government to turn over his technology to make weapons, however he feels that the technology should stay with him, however another physics prodigy has other ideasThe reason that the original Iron Man was so good for me, besides the fact that marvel had finally taken creative control over their own characters, was that Robert Downey Jr. was able to completely personify the character of Tony Stark. In Iron Man 2 he is back again doing all of the things which made the original so great. However in my opinion it was Mickey Rourke who stole the show.With a combination of excellent script writing and an actor who has really found his form again, Rourke was able to take a Marvel character who isn't particularly strong or developed, and give him an amazing screen presence, every scene he is in you feel uneasy, with his appearance intimidating, and his lines delivered to perfection to give the audience the feeling that this guy knows exactly what he is doing.Sam Rockwell is also typically brilliant as the Tony Stark wannabe, with all of the one liners, but none of the charm, every time he is on screen, you can't wait to see him get his comeuppance.I do feel that after the first big action sequence the film begins to let off the pace a little too much, where I personally was left slightly bored waiting for what I was sure to be a big finale. One positive in the middle section for Marvel fans however is that the middle section is full of fan service, look out for a famous piece of memorabilia in Tony's labThis brings me to my next biggest complaint. Nick Fury, Samuel Jackson and the writers have managed to take one of Marvel's greatest heroes and turn him into what I can only describe as a non-character. Nothing he says in this film captures the comic book character, and some of the one liners are painful. I feel that fans of Marvel will like him purely because they know who he is supposed to be, however people who are unfamiliar with the comics I imagine will not understand this character.However the ending of this film is so utterly well done that it reduces all of my complaints to knit picks, with a showdown of epic proportions that is sure to have you leaving the cinema feeling completely satisfied.P.S. Marvel fans don't forget to wait until after the credits, no matter how much of a fool you feel waiting",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Iron Man 2Super-heroes should never reveal their alias – who do you think they'll blame for all those flipped cars, smashed buildings, and dead bystanders?Luckily, Iron Man, otherwise known as Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), is well heeled, and can easily cover restitution.But what he can't afford is: a Senator (Garry Shandling) demanding his technology, a Russian looking for revenge (Mickey Rourke), a Russian with a secret (Scarlett Johansson), relationship woes with his assistant (Gwyneth Paltrow), best friend (Don Cheadle) and dead father (John Slattery); not to mention a corrupt competitor (Sam Rockwell), and the Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson).With its revolving door of characters, its lack of action, and endless Avengers Initiative preamble, Iron Man is much denser and duller this time around.Moreover, if Iron Man's armour existed, it wouldn't belong to the government, but on the stage...in the ultimate production of The Wizard of Oz.

Atomic Man Boobs 2: Worst Comic Book Movie Ever?,"Everyone involved in the making of this film, from Robert Downey Jr down to the assistant's assistant's assistant whose only job was to gently dab the anus of Gwyneth Paltrow's chihuahua with lemon-scented baby wipes, must all be packed into a spaceship and blasted into the sun.Stupid. Juvenile. Predictable. Embarrassing.Supposedly Mickey Rourke actually spent time in a Moscow prison and studied Russian history to ""prepare for his role"" ... erm, for what exactly, to play a human cartoon? If you'd told me he got the part in the morning and was shooting by midday I'd have no reason to doubt that. His character was stunningly dreadful. As were everyone else of course.Only bright spot in an otherwise abysmal 2 hours of cinematic shite was Sam Rockwell. As ever, he's interesting and fun to watch.

One Of The Worst Sequels Ever Made.,"Everything that made Iron Man such a refreshing, entertaining & thrilling ride is completely lost in this sequel as the third instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is possibly their worst film to date, is a pathetic follow-up to what was & still remains a fascinating action- adventure, and even Robert Downey Jr.'s charisma is unable to conceal its poor narrative & shoddy execution.Set six months after the events of the first film, Iron Man 2 continues the story of Tony Stark and covers the intense media attention he's been enjoying after revealing his identity as Iron Man to the whole world while resisting the US government who covets his technology & battling his own personal health as well for his arc reactor is poisoning him. And we also have a new enemy in town pursuing a personal vendetta against Stark.Directed by Jon Favreau, it's hard to believe that it's the same guy who helmed the last feature for he seems to have forgotten everything that made the previous film work. The screenplay is terrible from the start for the concept looks clear but it lacks refinement on deeper levels. Cinematography is fine, Editing makes sure every irrelevant scene makes its way into the final print & there's nothing new to add about its score.Coming to the performances, Scarlett Johansson, Mickey Rourke & Sam Rockwell join the reprising cast while Don Cheadle takes over Terrence Howard's role but not even one of them is good enough. Downey Jr. retains his charm n wit but even he fails to bring back the magic that was there the last time, Rourke started well but is then completely sidelined until the end, Johansson fails to make a big impression while Rockwell is surprisingly forgettable.On an overall scale, Iron Man 2 is a major step down when compared to its predecessor, is a massive downgrade in quality in all filmmaking aspects & a definite loss of opportunity to build something spectacular after such a brilliant platform was provided to it by the first film. Even the action is pretty boring & is over way too quick, the villain isn't intimidating enough & majority of its characters are treated as caricatures.

Finally an Iron Man film - not a film about a guy in an Iron Man suit.,"The first Iron Man film seemed more like an action film with a guy in an Iron Man suit than anything else. This film actually felt more like an Iron Man movie and it was a more enjoyable experience. All the usual, excellent cast members, made their appearances. Robert Downey JR. and Gwyneth Paltrow are the returning champs while Sam Rockwell, Mickey Rourke and Garry Shandling come along for this one. Finally, Scarlett Johansson finds an action role fit for her and it should carry her into Marvel History as the Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff in future film endeavors – I hope. After seeing her in ""The Spirit"" (2008), I was a little worried. Samuel L. Jackson continues his outstanding portrayal of Nick Fury. However, there is a casualty. They still haven't found the right guy for Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes. In the last film it was Terrence Howard, who looked the part, but I thought wasn't able to sell it well enough. In fact I laughed at him way too much. This time it hurts, because I like Don Cheadle, but not here. The search continues. The SPFX totally do the job right. There is an excellent introduction in the beginning of the film of our hero to the blaring tunes of AC/DC, that is totally believable and quite exciting. Many of the fight scenes truly give us the feeling that we are seeing a comic-book come to life. What is good about this film is, if you do not know much about Iron Man that does not matter. Anybody will enjoy this one and can follow along with the story. Mickey Rourke adds a nicely acted dimension as the bad guy that Tony Stark's Iron Man has to face. I rather enjoyed this film after having a bad taste in my mouth after watching the first one.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Passed the sequel challenge,"First things first how did this sequel one up itself from it's predecessor? Continuity: The film takes place 6 months after Stark reveals his identity in the first film and the entire plot is driven because of that.Characters: Downey Jr. is back and his freestyle acting yet again is what brightens his screen time. Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as Rhodes, which really didn't bother me that much because personally I think both Cheadle and Howard are brilliant actors. War Machine will not disappoint. Mickey Rourke plays Ivan Vanko who is a hybrid of the Crimson Dynamo and Backlash and this character should have been given more screen time. Paltrow comes back as Pepper and her ability to keep up with Downey has improved. If there is no Mandarin for this film at least they got Justin Hammer another well known foe who I think should have been the villain of the first film. Scarlett Johansson plays the Black Widow, pretty much that is a character for the male audience. And Sam Jackson plays Nick Fury.Action: It had a lot more bad-assery (hope that's a word) than the first film, a lot more. However it wasn't presented like that in the trailer, which therefore I was sort of hesitant to expect greatness. If the trailer was presented like the A-Team thats coming out this year or the first Spider-Man film eight years ago then I would have bought my ticket way in advance. But don't be mislead, there is a lot of action sequences.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good but not as good as the first one,"Iron Man was awesome but Iron Man 2 falls into the just good category. The main reasons for that is because of small loop holes in the script and not very good action sequences . In Iron Man 1 in the scene where Iron Man goes to save a village he launches a mini missile to destroy a tank and slowly walks away from the tank as its blown up in the background that was the first time that I actually shouted ""wohoo"" in a movie theater for an English movie. The action sequences in Iron Man 2 just did'nt have the ""wohoo"" factor. When comes to performances there is no need to say anything about the cast they are just so apt and perfect for their roles . But sadly an actor with talent like Mickey Rourke is left out as he has very less screen time but he surely does make his presence felt. In the end Iron Man 2 is a good but its former was much better in every aspect. Final verdict watch it for Robert Downey Jr. and the climax ( not becuz it's awesome but if you are a fan of Avengers this is where it begins ).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Brings back the fun but lacks the substance of the original,"The first Iron Man was a great film. The action was exciting, the interaction between the characters was great and Robert Downey Jnr was fantastic as Iron Man. The same can be said here but the film has something that stops it from being as good as the original. Its like they made the perfect sequel but it wasn't long enough so they filled it up with lots of unnecessary scenes that slow the film down and edited out Mickey Rouke's scenes.That said there is a lot to like here. Fans of the original will enjoy this but from what I've heard the producers rushed the director to make this in two years instead of three, which is a shame. Mickey Rouke does a great performance as Whiplash and when he has a chance to show it, he is ruthless. He kills people but we only get to see the blood on his hands from after the fight leaving it for us to imagine the actual fight itself. He is the best thing about this film and its a shame that he has such a limited screen time as he is involved in the best action scene of the film set in Monaco.Other supporting cast members include Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer who is good in places but I felt that they could have given him more to do because it is clear that he is immersed in his role completely. Don Cheadle takes over the role of Rhodes and does a good job as well. Scarlett Johansson has some great fight scenes but again they could have used her more as well. Gwyneth Paltrow gives another good performance but sadly she was in many of the scenes that could have been edited down.Another problem for some people is the advertising of the up-coming Avengers film. This is more time that could have been spent developing the villains of the film. There are also a lot of reference to it such as Captain America's shield. There is also a fight scene in Tony's house that was silly and you were not sure who you were supposed to be supporting and also do we really need to see Tony drunk, shooting empty bottles of champagne at a party? Tony is meant to be different to other superheroes but there are scenes like this make him less likable.However as mentioned earlier there is a lot to like and it comes towards the end of the film. The final action sequence is enjoyable (even though hundreds of people would have died) and had everything you would expect to see in an Iron Man film. There is also a lot of funny dialogue between characters, which keeps this enjoyable. I only hope that the next one fixes the problems from this and features what everyone loved from the first.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Scarlet Johansson is fantastic in this movie.,"This is one of the best science fiction movies Hollywood has made in many years. The middle of the movie drags a little, but it finishes strong. Robert Downey is great but the real star is Scarlet Johansson. She is beautiful; she is fantastic; she is wonderful. Her fight scenes are incredible; her overall performance is magnificent. Also she definitely has a flair for comedy. In short, Ms. Johansson is a great performer and proves it in this movie. Ten stars for Scarlet Johansson. Mickey Rourke is also excellent as the bad guy. The cgi's add to the story. This movie is actually better than the original. The Tony Stark character is further developed and the audience learns Pepper Potts' first name.

Iron Man 2,"Sadly, this is really quite a lacklustre sequel that takes formulaic to a whole new level. ""Stark"" (Robert Downey Jnr.) has now been outed as the eponymous super hero, and just about everyone is after his technology. Aside from Uncle Sam, it appears that the son of his now deceased business partner - ""Ivan Vanko"" (Mickey Rourke) - is first in the queue. Armed with some pretty impressive laser whips, he is out to avenge his poor dead dad. Meantime, business rival ""Hammer"" (Sam Rockwell) sees an opportunity to capitalise on this by offering the government a drone army that could do the peace in our time bit, but of course he has a megalomanic ulterior motive... Though the film looks good, and there are plenty of action scenes with pyrotechnics and airborne antics, the scenarios recycle themselves once to often. There is no jeopardy, and both Rockwell and Rourke really just substitute excessive ham for menace. Most of the originality and humour of the first film has been lost, indeed this is just a bit relentless and actually quite dull. Perhaps because so many of the other MCU characters are more interesting than this one?

Upped to the 10th Power,"A couple of things we knew we were going to see - hinted at in the 1st Film - Rhodey as War Machine, the Suitcase-Suit, the dying Stark who has to drink 80 glasses of Green Machine a day, Pepper Potts as the head of Stark Industries - S.H.I.E.L.D., Nick Fury and The Avengers - Black Widow! We get to see all of it in some form or other in this excellent Sequel. Adding to my belief that Robert Downey Jr was practically born to play Tony Stark, he builds on the first performance and reveals even more about who Iron Man is.Nothing really can be said about this that otherwise cannot be seen by simply watching the film. In Blu-Ray if Possible, on DVD if not... Looks good both ways.My only beef is that Terence Howard did not reprise the role of Rhodey/War Machine - But the addition of Scarlett Johanssen as Black Widow, Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, Mickey Rourke as Vanko, and Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury - Ease my initial disappointment at seeing Don Cheadle take up the mantle of War Machine - But the fact that Cheadle plays it JUST like Howard did - Even the Mannerisms, so it really IS the same Character, Cheadle does the best he can, not being Physically matched to Howard but personality-wise captured it. Also, the repeat performance of Leslie Bibb as the Vanity Fair Reporter Christine Everhart was well used- Even hinting that she was a fair Reporter, so maybe if there are any more of these, we'll get to see her come back, probably one of my favourite characters from this franchise. Finally, director Jon Favreau gets to be Happy Hogan a Lot MORE in this film much to my relief (Why recreate a great Iron Man character and only show them twice? Much better to have them in the film as much as the story can benefit by it?) The choice of Justin Theroux/Screenwriter made this a much darker story than the initial Iron Man story - As Tony builds Iron Man in the first film, this film mirrors that by having Vanko building his Arc-Reactor weApon. I thought they were bringing In Omega Red (X-Men Villain) into the story with the addition of Vanko, but apparently this is a combination of a couple of Iron Man Villains.This film is just another link in the upcoming promise of an Avengers film, and Marvel is gathering all of its forces for this effort.

Worth the ticket price but not as good as the first!,"The film was entertaining and i felt like i'd got decent value for my cinema ticket.Downy was great as usual, Rourke was excellent, and Don Cheadle was very good however i would have preferred Howard had reprise his role, he just added that little bit of extra grit to the character.The special effects were amazing, the humour was there, and the action scenes were on the whole excellent.There were two main downsides to the movie that stopped it being an all time great - Scarlett Johansson: a completely pointless role, apart from shots of her in her bra she didn't offer anything to the character, her fight scenes were annoyingly unrealistic and far fetched, and at one point she managed to change her hairstyle for a fight. She was clearly added for sex appeal for the fan boys but surprisingly didn't look as hot as usual.The end fight: the fight between Rourkes character and Ironman lasted about 30 seconds and without spoiling the film for people who haven't scene it had more than a predictable ending.Well worth a watch but it didn't have the wow factor of the original.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Why do people hate this movie? It's every bit as good as the first one!,"""Iron Man 2"" (2010), this movie is equally as good as the first movie. What's with the hate it gets? It's definitely a worthy sequel to ""Iron Man"" (2008). Granted, it's not quite as good as the first film. But, I still consider it a perfect movie by my standards. It has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and a perfect soundtrack. The story is a continuation after the first film. After the opening scene, it takes off with no looking back. This movie digs deeper into a strong story, with a lot going on. The first one had a lot going on, but this one has a lot more subplots. But, they are all resolved in the end, and that's what's important for a well done story. Once again, Robert Downey Jr. is pitch- perfect as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Gwyneth Paltrow is great as Pepper, and Don Cheadle does a good job as Rhodey. To be honest, Don Cheadle is not as good as Terence Howard in this role. However, he does still work as a passable substitute as Rhodey. Scarlett Johansson joins the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie. She does a great job, and she puts out her second best performance in this one, out of all her roles in this franchise, with her best performance being in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014). Mickey Rourke does an excellent job as the villain; Ivan Vanko, and Sam Rockwell does a great job as Justin Hammer. The sets/locations are beautifully laid out, and work perfectly with the context of the film. Obviously, being 2010 when this film was released, the special effects are first rate. Finally, the soundtrack is well composed with the tone of this movie. Overall, this is a solid sequel, and every bit worth watching as the first movie. I never understood the unnecessary hate it gets. I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars.

Well what do you expect?,"When you went to see the first Iron Man movie what were you expecting? Thats right, Guns, Women and Explosions and lots of them and that's precisely what you got. Now that the second movie is out I have heard many people complain that it is rubbish and not as good as the old one and I ask myself ""What film did they go and see?"" Because when I saw the new Iron Man I loved it. I don't mean in a ""film of all time"" kinda way, I mean in a ""seat gripping adrenalin"" kind of way. It has all the essential elements of the previous movie with the addition of Scarlett Johansson which, in my books, is a very welcome one. Now this isn't the first time that I have heard people say this about a film which leads me to thinking that there is a sub-culture of people whose MO is to immediately dislike a sequel. Granted, in most case the sequels are never as good as the original but when you are considering movies like Iron Man you can't maintain too high an expectation or you will always be disappointed. With this movie I think they did good.To conclude, the long and the short of the movie is this, starts off where the last finished, starts going out of control, chaos, nearly dies, avengers do their bit, new suit, big fight, the end.

Good action film,"They took the complexities of Tony Stark that they established in movie one and built upon it masterfully. Now we get a reformed and guilt ridden weapons manufacturer weaved with a celebrity who should have never let the cat out of the bag in the final moments of Iron Man 1. They promised to up the action from the first film and they certainly did but the storytelling never suffers for it. Like in 2008, the evolution and growth of the characters is of paramount importance. It has the same flavor and humor of the original and it may even focus more on the fabulous relationships already developed. I was stunned at how they managed to deliver a better film. I didn't think that was possible. Everyone came to play and this great cast brought their best stuff and it shows on screen.

Iron Man 2,The world knows Stark is Iron Man and the government don't like it and want to take control. Howard Stark's ex partner's son and scientist in his own right (Rourke) wants revenge for his father being left out and Stark's competitor Hammer (Rockwell) recruits Rourke. Meanwhile Stark is dying - his heart gadget won't last and he starts behaving like a idiot accordingly much to the annoyance of love to be Paltrow. Scarlet Johansson puts in her first appearance as Black Widow.This is the synopsis and indeed it is overly complex and baggy compared to the wonderful simplicity of the first one. That said Downey Jr's performance and humour plus some good set pieces still make this a lot of fun. It is though the weakest of the 3 Iron Man films.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fun and honest movie.,"After The Dark Knight, it seems most of people always expect movies being all the same, nothing more than carbon copies of themselves.That said, is important to mention Iron Man 2 was quite a surprise. I was expecting for a movie with silly dialogue and over the top and pointless action.However the movie was way better than I thought and it gave me fun, some good laughs and emotion. Don't expect action throughout the movie. The action IS in the movie and it was WAY better than the first movie.There is a good amount of dialogue, but it's important to make people understanding some stuff that happens in the movie. There is character development, something hard to see nowadays, even in a ordinary flick.We had a cool hero, his lover, his friend, his nemesis, his problems, his fears. That's it, a honest movie with some good action scenes to make things better.Maybe the ending could be longer, and some characters didn't actually add too much. So far, these are my problems with the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 2 is the only film you must not miss. Simply Awesome!,"Just came back from a 12'clock session of this movie, a lot of people were there but i got a good spot so here it goes....Plot: Now that the world knows about the identity of Iron Man, Millionaire Tony Stark denies the governments demands to try to produce more of his iron man suit for the military. Later, he will face even more deadly enemy, Whiplash. Also featuring new heroes: Natalie Rushman and Lt. Col. James Rhodes (who soon becomes War Machine.) I didn't expect much for this to top off the first one, it did well and this movie is more superior than other superhero movies we know today, such as: Spider-Man and X-Men. It just made these two movies look like toy dolls.The running time made me felt like i was watching it for days, but it was a long experience of greatness. Even, the CGI effects have really changed and it was something different to see for movies today.Overall: Iron Man is back in this overloaded Blockbuster full of exploding action, laughs and dazzling CGI.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
great stuff,"i had high high expectations for this film,since the first one was so good.i'm happy to say i wasn't disappointed.there is more going on this one that much is certain.Sam Jackson returns as Nick Fury head of Shield in a expanded role.Mickey Rourke plays a baddie(with relish and gusto)Scarlett Johanssen's character is underwritten and underutilized,which is unfortunate,because the character is rife with potential.here's hoping they remedy that situation in the upcoming avengers film.Sam Rockwell has an interesting role.Don Cheadle replaces Terrance Howard as Lt.Colonel James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes,and i have to say,i think he is a better fit.and of course Robert and Gwyneth return as Pepper and Tony.and we finally get to know Pepper's actual first name.for me,Iron Man 2 is a 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""I'm not saying Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair, sipping on an iced tea, because I haven't come across anyone man enough to go toe to toe with me on my best day!""","An average sequel at best. Iron Man 2 is pretty disappointing and nowhere near reaches the height of its predecessor, but it could have been a whole lot worse. The result was a mediocre sequel. Iron Man 2 unfortunately suffers from too much world-building and setting up The Avengers (which it didn't even directly lead up to). The plot is also convoluted, but certainly not convoluted enough for it to be hard to understand the story.There are also flaws with some of the casting. Don Cheadle was miscast as War Machine/James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes. Howard was perfect as Rhodey and he would have been a better War Machine.Sam Rockwell was miscast as Justin Hammer. Marvel should have cast an old man to play Justin Hammer instead of someone much younger. Justin Hammer was an old, white-haired senior citizen with a cane in the comics, that's how he should've been in the movie. Mickey Rourke was miscast as the supervillain, Whiplash. Plus, he wasn't even the same Whiplash from the comics, in this movie, he was a Russian guy named Ivan Vanko who was never ever even from the comics, and Mickey Rourke's Russian accent was bad and unconvincing.Ivan Vanko was a terrible and forgettable villain and he was underdeveloped. S. H. I. E. L. D. Kept annoyingly popping in and out of the movie.Robert Downey Jr.'s performance was just okay in this sequel, but disappointing compared to his great performance in the original Iron Man film.Scarlett Johanssen gives a very good performance as Black Widow and one of the few positives from an average film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Sequels don't always cut it.,"Iron Man 2 is not on part with the first movie, not even close ,if anything this is the worst movie of the MCU as yet. The main reason for the decrease in quality from the Iron Man, is that Iron Man 2 is by default a filler,though quit an expensive one (it had a budget of 200 million, 60 million more than the first movie), but filler none the less which exist only to introduce S.H.I.E.L.D. and Black Widow in to the MCU and set the stage for the Avengers.Not that I am complaining for any of this things (:p), what can I say I am only human. So what is good with it?First the new actor who plays Rhodey Rhodes is really good and I buy why he and Tony are best friends, Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts is decent on her role, but the person who steal the show are Samuel L. Jackson's Nick Fury(one of the best casting ever) and Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, the role that made her in to the A-list actress she is today. For real why anyone in six years after this flick hasn't made a movie with her in the lead role?Second the action scenes are well executed and the CGI are great and don't disappoint either.Now the main drawbacks from the film: One the villain is just there in order for Iron Man to have someone to fight. Two the movie's plot is slow and though it is only two hours and five minutes long it feels much longer. Third and final is the man himself (Not Stan Lee) Tony , whose character doesn't change from the whole situation, to be honest after the first Iron Man ,his character will remain mostly the same up to Civil War eight years and five movies later.In the end Iron Man 2 is an enjoyable movie with good action and a mostly functional plot. An the fact that is the worst for what the Marvel Studio has gave us or among the worst if you include Thor and Thor the Dark World.,which aren't also bad, just not the best, is a sign that this one of the best Franchices in history.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Who cares about ""It could be better"", It already IS the BEST!","Well, if you ask me what is the greatest super hero movie of all time, i can tell you even for 1000 times, it's Iron man 2. Why? Because it's better than Iron Man 1. The better story line of Iron man 2 attracted me right from the first time i've seen the trailer. It is not just a movie for kids like the first one, it's more complicated yet simple enough for us to understand and not making our head hurt like The Dark Knight did when we try to figure out what the real meaning of everything is. In Iron man 2, everything is almost obvious but still, there is something and someone can make you say: Wow! I didn't expect that! The graphic, what can i say, Kick-Ass. All the Marks look better with all those gadgets and weapons. The HUD is cooler and Jarvis, well, he is one of the biggest hits of the movie. I was shocked when the first time i watched the movie, when Tony uses his basement aka laboratory. I was like: WTH? Is that near future? If that is then that really kicks Avatar's future ass. Iron man 2 doesn't need to be 3D. It hits very hard in 2D already. The graphic of Iron man 2 is a real masterpiece that you can not take your eyes off the screen once you started to watch. Mr. Robert Downey Jr. comes back impressively. Together with Gwyneth, they create the funniest couple in a super hero movie. Samuel and Scarlett didn't exceptional job although they didn't really play big parts. Sam Rockwell still rocks with his moves, he may be a bit annoying but that is what we are looking for, an annoying and jealous Justin Hammer. Don Cheadle, yeah, i saw how he managed to be Terrence Howard, not very good but still a great effort. Thanks to the War Machine suit, his face is limited behind the mask and the movie is safe.Phew! Some would say Iron man 2 is boring, he is invincible. Yeah, so? Doesn't the world need a perfect super hero, rather than a man of steel who's scared by Cryptonite, rather than a dark knight who is affected badly by emotions and decisions that never had his real life. Tony Stark is a typical super hero. He showed the world who he is, yeah, he can do that, because he the coolest and the strongest. The world needs him, a perfect hero. It's 100% that he kicks all villains ass, it's not a rated R movie, not a super block buster movie but has a great crew. Whoever you are, just try Iron man 2 for once. It is not disappointing, no it is not!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
An okay film that mostly works because of Robert Downey Jr,"Iron Man 2 is the sequel to the really rather good Iron Man and is a fun and easily enjoyed action film. Robert Downey Jr is again excellent as playboy technologist Tony Stark/Iron Man and his charisma and wisecracking keep the film rolling along nicely. The plot of Iron Man 2 doesn't really match that of Iron Man which was full of contemporary touches but the basic premise is that a Russian rival to Iron Man emerges and attacks Iron Man who must battle someone nearly as brilliant as he is.That Russian rival is the fantastic Mickey Rourke who puts on a believable Russian accent and looks terrific as the downtrodden son of a genius who lived in poverty and obscurity while the Starks lived in glamour and luxury. The revenge that Rourke's character creates is not much of a plan as it basically involves him fighting and losing in a very public sphere but that is only the setup for the rest of the film where Rourke is given the resources to build a credible threat to Iron Man's prowess.The first showdown between the main villain and main hero is a bit more flash than substance. Rourke's character with electrode whips is awesome but the Monaco GP is not well rendered. Mixing a real event that the audience will be very familiar with and the fantasy can work but it doesn't here. The cars fly about and explode at unrealistic angles and it is all just an excuse for fire. Later action sequences also make suspension of disbelief a little difficult especially when the heroes are cornered and don't just use their otherwise ubiquitous flying abilities to get out of a difficult spot.The action is what is always difficult about sequels. More explosions doesn't necessarily equal better fun. What was terrific about the first Iron Man was the character of Tony Stark. Here he again is excellent but too much time is given to shiny effects. Fortunately there is more than enough of Stark the man to make this a good film. For reasons that become clear during the plot, Stark is living life as if it could end soon and his breakdown is harming his business. The very reliable Pepper Potts picks up the slack and makes actually a much better CEO than Stark does even when he's not having emotional trouble.The father-son relationship stuff is interesting if not overly original. The key plot device contained within the design of a future world city is a little less creative than this reviewer at least came up with but it is still decent fare. The metaplot items are there for those who look hard enough including the Expo which seems a clear reference to Shanghai and Russian-American arms treaties that are currently going through Congress can be read into the Congressional hearing scenes though there's nothing quite as impressive as that cave in Afghanistan from Iron Man 1.The supporting cast are decent. The new Rhodes played by Don Cheadle is a massive upgrade and his is a much better supporting role representing the tension between the collective good as represented by the military, and the good that an individual can do represented by Stark. The plot that surrounds War Machine is very believable. Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer is the comic relief and while he may be a bit fidgety at times, the banter that he is on the receiving end of for the most part is terrific particularly before Congress. Scarlett Johansson's Natasha Romanoff is not much more than a stereotypical sci fi martial artist but for those who are fans of hers she will have some appeal. Samuel L. Jackson gets slightly more lines than in the first film and he does what he can with limited screen time. Gwyneth Paltrow is again excellent - are her best performances the two Iron Man films? Pepper Potts is thrust into a more senior role in this film and Paltrow brings it off expertly, she has great timing with Robert Downey Jr and their scenes all work very well together.The lighting and effects are good if not mesmerising. The overarching shots of the Stark Expo are beautiful. Not all the visual sequences work well and the Stark Cheerleaders are an unfortunately size zero group of models so it is a relief that they are not featured much. The post-credits scene is just about worth waiting for but only just unlike the first film which was definitely worth waiting for.The film itself could be a 3 or a 4 star outing. It is not as good as the original but is still some nice lighthearted fun made much better by Downey Jr.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Good Action Great Movie,I Loved The first Iron Man but this is by far so much better in every way due to the superior Iron Man's Return as Tony Stark.

There is however an evil native man trying to get his revenge after the death of his father from the mighty Iron Man. He turns himself into a electrical vaporising machine man where he starts off Tony in the Grand Prix of auto racing and goes head to head with Iron Man in front of a whole crowd and stadium. Later on he experiments on a whole army of ironic machines and sends them to kill Iron Man but Iron Man 2 his sidekick is there to help and in the end defeat the mega electrical native man.

Just awful,"Coming off of Iron Man (1), I really had pretty decent expectations for this movie. It seemed like the writers had their act together in creating a well thought out film that could combine both coherent plot-lining and captivating special effects. Iron Man was never the most popular comic book, but the producers recognized that they didn't need to create an A.D.D. nightmare to compete with the big boys.Boy, they sure f*cked up with the sequel...I understand that Stark is supposed to be increasingly eccentric, and Downey did a fine job of communicating that. But guess what? The rest of the characters were written that way too, which is just too much! Even the bit players are obnoxious and unbelievable. In Stark's Senate hearing session, for example, the audience lets off a hooting of cheers and applause every 10 seconds, and the investigating senator shouts ""F*ck you Tony Stark; F*ck you Tony"" into the microphone at the end of the hearing. Believable? Hardly. Necessary? Absolutely not. Trashy? 100%. Even superhero movies have to have some element of the plot grounded in reality to make a connection with the audience. Iron Man 2 had nothing.Don Cheadle was a poor substitute for Terrence Howard, delivering his lines without any sense of purpose or emphasis. I typically think Cheadle is a fantastic actor, but poorly done here. Again, the resounding issue in the film comes down to believability. The ""willing suspension of disbelief"" is absolutely necessary in any fictional work (particularly one with such fantastic future technologies), but should absolutely not apply to actors' ability to connect with their roles, nor to the coherence of the plot.The worst thing about the whole ordeal was that the movie was so terrible that I was forced to leave half-way through the movie, before Samuel L Jackson even made an appearance...",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A good continuation of the series.,"Even while I can understand some of the people's disappointments with this movie, the movie in itself is not a bad one at all. It's pretty good and entertaining for what it is, it just isn't ever up to par really with its predecessor.Basically the thing that this movie offers is some good, simple entertainment. And there really is nothing wrong with that, as long as you don't expect a very clever or well written story, with plenty of surprises and originality to it.It of course is still a shame that this movie didn't featured a better and more compelling story in it. The movie does in fact feels rushed, as if the studios were in a hurry to shoot and release it, after the surprising big financial and critical success of the first ""Iron Man"" movie. It's a good continuation of the series but not one that is offering much new stuff. In fact, it's a bit of a more poorly done rehash, without all of the great wittiness and spectacle of the first movie. But perhaps this is also due to it that this movie feels less fresh, since we already are familiar with all of the characters and its universe.But still, the one thing that mostly was disappointing about this movie was its poor handling of the villain's story lines. But in all honesty, this also was the biggest problem of the first movie. It's a shame that this was something they didn't managed to do right this time around. The villains often aren't featured prominently enough and it's not always exactly clear who the main villain is supposed to be. Besides, their plot lines just aren't the most interesting ones and definitely also not original at all.Nothing wrong with the actors playing the characters though. Robert Downey Jr. once again returns as Tony Stark/Iron Man. He is being sort of less likable this time, even while you are supposed to be sympathizing even more with him in this movie but hey, he is still being an awesome character and Robert Downey Jr., as always, did a more than good job. But there of course also are some additions to the cast this time. Mickey Rourke was a great villain but didn't always get used well and not enough throughout the entire movie. The one person I in fact was very fond of was Sam Rockwell, as Justin Hammer. This guy is such a great actor and lets hope he will get to reprise this role in future movies. I even wasn't all that bothered with Scarlett Johansson, as Black Widow. I actually thought she got incorporated into the story pretty well and wasn't distracting at all, as most other people seem to think.And really, this is not a bad movie at all. Even while it does plenty of stuff wrong, the movie still manages to bring some decent entertainment and also some good action. It's never boring to watch, since the story is always kept going and as far as big budget superhero flicks go, this still is being one of the better ones to watch out there.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Re-watched after the last 2 years of MCU content,"Disney is now taking control.addition of a female specifically referred to as ""powerful"" - check!addition of incompetent, bumbling male idiot - check!addition of a fighting female that humiliates bumbling male idiot - check!also said female somehow does damage to numerous large trained male guards, without sustaining any damage herself - check!Disney's influence is starting to be seen clearly and immediately, however it is in its early stages, so it is soft and the creativity the authors of the original material had is still there.The interesting thing is there is a scene that touches on an unfortunately very unpopular idea in modern America - the idea of private property and self-ownership independent from government. I believe this is the first and last time we witness such a scene in a Marvel movie, since Disney becomes more and more involved in the process.Overall an entertaining, honest and focused (except the several Disney things mentioned in the beginning) movie, which is way better than any of the MCU content from the last about 2 years.Checkout my review with the same title of Iron Man for reference of why I wrote the previous sentence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A bit underwhelming!,"From a sequel to the excellent original you expect more and better. While this movie isn't bad it did not wow me like the first one did. Robert Downy junior is excellent and does save the movie from getting extremely dull. I can understand the director's approach to make this superhero movie into something more. But in doing so he sacrificed the one thing that matters the most in movies like this,action. There is not enough action. And the action that was depicted wasn't nearly as exciting as it was in the original. For a movie about Iron Man there just wasn't enough Iron Man to be enjoyed. And let's face it. That is the one reason people are coming to see this movie. To me the plot in an action movie is always secondary. Since in this case the focus was on the story I do have to say something about it. Well,that is going to be difficult. There is no coherent plot to speak of. And as a result it is far less compelling than it could have been. The villain (Mickey Rourke) isn't bad ass enough to actually be taken as a serious threat. The introduction of Black Widow showed promise,but ultimately was more used as window dressing. Finally we got to see War Machine in action. Still far to brief for my liking. All in all there is a decent movie but nowhere near the level of the far superior original.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 2 is Totally Worth it.,"Iron Man 2 left me a very pleasant taste. Maybe it doesn't have the same amount of action than the first one but it is compensated with better CGI, a better developed plot and a more interesting story. Billionaire Tony Stark must contend with deadly issues involving the government, his own friends, as well as new enemies due to his superhero alter ego Iron Man. As I say before, this sequel isn't full of action like the first one but in my opinion it has enough to leave you satisfied and entertained. It also has good moments of humor specially from Robert Downey Jr. The cast is excellent, and practically the same of the first one with the addition of Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman/Black Widow and Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vankov/Whiplash and the substitution of Terence Howard with Don Cheadle as Rhodey, in fact I think that with Cheadle the movie gains in acting . Downey is again perfect as Tony Stark/Iron Man, it is a role made for him. Gwyneth Paltrow is good enough as Pepper Potts and Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as Nick Fury. In conclusion, Iron Man isn't as exciting as the first one but it has everything to be a total summer blockbuster and pleased the viewer.

Iron Man's mid series crisis,"After the massive success of the first Iron Man movie and the new Incredible Hulk (2008) movie Marvel had many more movies planned in the future such as Thor and Captain America which would later create the Avengers team up movie Avengers Assemble but while those movies were in production Marvel needed to fill the gap with a new movie so we got Iron Man 2 to fill that gap.The first Iron Man movie was amazing and visually stunning which also introduced (Robert Downey Jr) as Tony Stark/Iron Man the movie was action packed, funny, smart and was everything we wanted in an Iron Man movie including the usual (Stan Lee) cameo so Iron Man 2 had a lot to live up to but did it deliver?.The movies storyline is a bit of a let down with most of story focusing on Tony Stark battling with the government to keep the Iron Man project in his hands only. Tony gets sick and has a sort of a midife I'm know I'm going to die crisis where Robert Downey Jr basically has to act like he did when he was on drugs so that's funny in an ironic way. The movies main villain played by (Mickey Rourke) is just the most generic movie villain ever and doesn't really have any defining characteristics unless you count speaking Russian there are a few fight scene's in the movie but only one is decent and sadly it's in the last 20 minutes of the movie and by this point your half asleep from boredom and sick of the constant unfunny jokes and sarcasm from Tony Stark so by the end of the movie you enjoy the action because it's the only real action in the movie which in a comic book movie you'd expect more of especially from Iron Man.Overall the movie isn't bad but it just isn't as action oriented as it should of been and the storyline could of been so much interesting but the movie does introduce (Don Cheadle) as War Machine who would later partner up with Iron Man and become an Anvenger himself the movie also introduces (Scarlet Johansson) as Black Widow who has her own kick ass fight scene in the movie her character would later get more back story and a more quiet badass persona in the Avengers movie but for a first introduction of the character it's done rather well.The special effects and CGI are admittedly a little better than they were in the first movie which makes sense as it had a higher budget and the Iron Man design was kept in it's Mark II stage War Machine also stands out from Iron Man making it easy to tell them apart even when using simular effects and in fast paced action scenes.I recommend watching this movie if your a fan of comics, Iron Man or just Marvel and the MCU as a whole and while not the best movie in the MCU it's still very entertaining and continued to make Avengers a reality in the years to come.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

I think the weakest writing was for the Scarlett Johnannsen character, but her acting was good in spite of that. The main attraction for me, even though I'm a fan of Robert Downey Jr., was Mickey Rourke and he did not disappoint. He's the best thing about this film when he's in a scene. Not the anyone else is a slouch, but I'm glad Mickey is back in films. I will add that I can't picture anyone else playing Tony Stark, though. Very impressed with the CGI and other special effects.

I am Iron Man the suit and I are one.,Iron Man 2 starts off where the first one left off and hits the ground running from there. Tony Stark is a national icon Iron Man is seen by a grateful American public as a protector. The government sees the armour as a weapon of mass power that should not be in the hands of just one man. Then there is Justin Hammer a Business rival of Tony Stark's who is obsessed with creating his own Iron Man armour and mass producing it. the Trouble is this the tech used for Iron Man is so superior to anything out there that Stark figures it will take at least twenty years to create an armour like his. Tony is living large and hiding a tragic secret but on top of all of that comes Ivan Vanko or Whiplash armed with tech. Dangerously close to Starks Vanko wants revenge . plus there is betrayal spy work and of course the Black widow wonderfully played by Scarlett Johansson and the ever gruff super spy tough guy legend Nick Fury played by the one and only Sam.L.Jackson. The movie moves at a rocket pace and delivers the acting is solid the story is strong and the story ties up all the loose ends plus gives us more Iron Man and the introduction of War Machine Tony's best friend and fellow crime fighter.

A high-flying sequel with new challenges,"""Iron Man 2,"" directed by Jon Favreau, continues the saga of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) as he grapples with the dual burdens of his superhero identity and the legacy of his father's company. This sequel introduces new characters, including the enigmatic Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and the vengeful Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), adding layers to the expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe.Downey Jr. Maintains his charismatic portrayal of Stark, balancing the character's ego and vulnerability. The dynamic between Stark and his friend James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes (Don Cheadle) evolves, particularly as Rhodes dons the War Machine armor. Rourke's Vanko, with his electrified whips, presents a formidable, if somewhat underdeveloped, antagonist.The film excels in its action sequences and special effects, offering thrilling aerial battles and high-tech showdowns.

I liked how the story about the antagonist managed to blend well with the story about Toni's father, I liked the design of the weapons the russian dude used, but the final fight where both Toni and Rhodes went in battle against Ivan Vanko was blank, empty and short. Nothing spectacular happened and the fight was 10 seconds long, altho we were waiting for a grand final ending where Ivan would finally show his upgraded super-weapon.

Jackson, Scarlett Johansson, and Don Cheadle (Rhodey was previously played by Terrence Howard in the first film).The plot is all over the place: partially an ""Iron Man"" sequel and partially a set up for ""The Avengers"" that would follow two years later. As such there are many instances where it seems like there are too many plot threads going around and the pacing of the film flashes around like a pinball. It's not necessarily a bad thing, as the audience is rarely left with a dull or uninteresting moment; but because of its bloated cast and its 125 minute runtime, we aren't really given much room for character development. Whiplash, sadly, could have been remembered as one of the most iconic Marvel villains, but there are very few scenes in which him and Tony Stark are paired together and he only truly begins his villainous scheme in the last 40 minutes of the film.It's important for its introduction of more and more things to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it disappoints slightly as it really could have fleshed out the motivation of Whiplash and the inner demons of Tony Stark better. Great special effects and good performances. It's obviously a crucial piece of the MCU pie and thus you won't be left too badly burnt on your road to better constructed and more entertaining films.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
better than 1st,"after a less than mediocre start to the series iron man 2 had a bit more of a kick, although the action was not throughout what there was was impressive. especially the Monaco race. overall a massive improvement on the first and a relatively good film. it is a good film to see with some friends on a Friday evening and 1 i will probably be thinking about getting on DVD. on this note i guess i am great full of the lack of 3dness as it defiantly doesn't need it and in the cinema it bumps up the ticket prices.overall i would definitely recommend you to watch this, but don't expect it to be your favourite film although for me it was up there with avatar and shutter island (another one to watch) for this year. hope this is helpful and sorry about my terrible spelling ;P",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Meh!,"I was never into Iron Man. X-men I liked, Spider-man was OK, but how can I identify with a rich jerk who just happens to be a self absorbed genius? I mean, I'm not rich!Other people must have felt like me, since I've never heard of Iron Man being of the same caliber as most other comic book heroes. After all, he is a technological Superman who didn't have nice parents. But while Superman battled Lex Luthor or some evil villains from his home planet, Iron Man battles moron competitors, the uselessness of the military and some guy with a grudge. It just doesn't work.Mickey Rourke again takes on his old, fat, long haired persona, only now he is also dirty and speaks mainly Russian. When he does speak English he doesn't make much sense. Iron Man does a little Go-Go-Don-Cheadle-Gadget and wins. Samuel L. Jackson appears in a few scenes as the parental figure that knows all, can do all, yet he needs Iron Man for an abstruse reason while Paul Bettany does... the voice of Jarvis.Bottom line: The only thing that doesn't waste one's time is seeing Scarlett Johansson as a hot redhead again, with Gwyneth Paltrow steaming with cat-envy around her. The rest of the film is consistently average, never once creating a moment of true tension or at least great special effects, while it never goes to a moment of bad quality either. So, yeah... meh!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A great blockbuster action movie to kick off the summer,"The sequel in the Iron Man series is one that is very welcoming, original for a second movie and a great blast of a movie to kick off the summer right. It was a lot of fun, there WAS a great villain, awesome action scenes with likable characters. The movie was a perfect length at about 2 hours but some scenes I felt could have been left out and even a character as well. As Scarlett Johanson is very attractive her character could have easily been never put in because there is no real importance even though it was refreshing and she brings the sex appeal to the movie goers.I really enjoyed the movie and it is actually a worth while sequel to an eventually long and spread out series in the future. This second film was an exiting experience that had comic relief in certain parts of the movie. It is not full of action but when there is, it is very cool as the special effects are awesome. Overall, i recommend all movie fans to see this movie. It is a great time, not really any swearing and suitable for the kids of all ages.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Good Sequel to the First Film,"Considering how much I liked the first film, I was expecting to like this one just as much. However, this was a tad disappointing. I loved the new additions to the story like Nick Fury and Natasha Romanoff, who both had pivotal roles to play in the movie, although they could have been given more screen-time. Sam Rockwell was good in his role as antagonist to Tony Stark, and Mickey Rourke played the creepy villain in this film. I loved Robert Downey Jr., and he shares amazing chemistry with Gwyneth Paltrow in this one. One issue I had with the film was that too many things were happening. The structure of the screenplay could have been kept simple. Could have been better but I enjoyed it nevertheless. A good enough sequel.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Convincing Film,"The thing that is so hard to do in films is to make your content convincing. This is why so many other films fail. Favreau does not fail. I was worried going into Iron Man 2 that it wasn't going to live up to its hype and its prequel. But it did. The only criticism I have is that it is a bit slow for its type of movie. However, the content within the slower scenes is often filled with witty dialogue, low-key visual spectacles, and some confusing concepts. What I'm trying to get at is that Iron Man's audience is typically smaller children, and for them, I would say this movie is going to be a bit boring, for it lacks in the action department for the most part. But what may be its downfall box-office-wise is also its greatest accomplishment. Much like the Dark Knight, Iron Man 2 takes the superhero world and not-cheesily but convincingly conveys what it would be like in today's world. Not to mention we actually see Tony Stark go through a hero cycle in this one, without taking away his compulsive and loud personality. All in all, Iron MAn's long awaited release was worth it in my eyes. It was a perfect movie to kick off the Summer hype films and it makes me eager to watch what else Favreau has planned for the franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Iron Man 2"": a worthy successor to the original","""Iron Man 2"" is the sequel to the highly successful ""Iron Man"" film, and it definitely delivers on the action and entertainment front. The film picks up where the first one left off, with Tony Stark struggling to come to terms with his new role as Iron Man and the responsibilities that come with it. The acting is once again top-notch, with Robert Downey Jr. Reprising his role as Stark and delivering a performance that is both charismatic and nuanced. The plot is also well-done, with a lot of twists and turns that keep the audience engaged.One of the things that sets ""Iron Man 2"" apart from the first film is the introduction of several new characters, including Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow and Mickey Rourke's Whiplash. These characters add a lot of depth to the film and make it even more enjoyable to watch. Additionally, the action sequences are even more impressive than the first film, with some truly spectacular set pieces.However, while ""Iron Man 2"" is a solid sequel, it doesn't quite live up to the first film. The pacing is a bit slower, and the villain, Whiplash, doesn't quite measure up to the first film's villain, Obadiah Stane. Additionally, the film feels a bit more like a setup for future films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, rather than a standalone story.Overall, ""Iron Man 2"" is a thrilling action film that is definitely worth a watch, especially if you enjoyed the first film. The acting is great, the action is spectacular, and the new characters are a welcome addition. While it may not be quite as good as the first film, it's still a solid addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Quite a drop-off from the first one!!,"Saw IRON MAN 2 over the weekend and thought it was merely okay. Doesn't come close to the original. And I wasn't exactly going crazy about the original one either. The best part was without a doubt the Monaco race track scene where Whiplash makes his entrance. That scene was, in one word, AMAZING!! Probably the greatest entrance of a villain in any superhero movie that I've seen. And the action that follows was equally brilliant! Unfortunately everything else ranged from merely okay to downright baaaad. Tony sitting in a donut was downright cringe-worthy as was Sam Jackson's lame line about exiting the donut. Hardy-harr-harr.. who the heck came up with that one? And the scene where Tony gets drunk and rowdy at the party immediately reminded me of the scene where Peter Parker does the same thing in SPIDER-MAN 3. Yuck!! And I agree with Roger Ebert - the finale was both overwhelming and underwhelming! Overwhelming because of all those hundreds of drones flying around blasting Iron Man with all the firepower they can muster. How the city stayed intact with all those huge fireballs left and right is beyond me. Much less how lucky can one Iron Man get against a slew of such machines. Even by comic-books standards this is really pushing it. But then we get to the showdown we've been waiting for - Iron Man vs. Whiplash! How long does that last? Oh a few measly seconds. Are you kidding me?! How can you create a climax which isn't even 1/4 as great as the racetrack scene. I wish they scrapped all those drones and gave us a proper ending with Iron Man vs. Whiplash. I mean this ending makes the ending in the original one (Iron Man vs. Iron Monger) look like a masterpiece in comparison. And I actually considered THAT one pretty underwhelming - there's just not too much excitement seeing two metal suits clanging against each other.So yeah I thought this one was a considerable drop-off from the first one. The actors were all good (though I still prefer the acting in the first one) and the racetrack scene was superior to anything in the first film but outside of that the story is really uninteresting and bland. And the ending, as I said, was both overwhelming and underwhelming.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

How super is it?,"I caught this movie with friends and in doing so became probably one of only a very few people to see it without having watched the first ""Iron Man"" movie. Knowing the basic premise behind the original comic book, though, I found that ""Iron Man 2"" holds up very well entirely on its own, and as a piece of entertainment is a thorough success with nary a dull moment.Like any good action movie, I think, ""Iron Man 2"" realizes it can't consist entirely of action, and this one at times feels just as much like a comedy or political thriller as it does a superhero-based special effects spectacular. That comedy is rooted in and succeeds because of really good character work, particularly with the lead Tony Stark. The script by Justin Theroux (who is, I found to my pleasure, related to the other writers Paul, Louis, Marcel, and Alexander Theroux) shows a facility with pointed, revealing dialogue and a whole lot of wit. This script also seems preoccupied with getting characters to declare -- if not in so many words ""Oh, yeah? Well just try and make me!"" which is deeply satisfying to empathize with even if it does eventually become a little repetitive as a theme.Robert Downey Jr gives another simply brilliant performance, and his character seems fully alive as a self-absorbed, witty, arrogant, and super-intelligent jerk of a superhero who knows his own life is about to end. This character is as much of a reason to watch the movie as anything.There is no attempt to hide the fact that much of the plot and its developments are based on pure technobabble -- a new element is discovered with suspicious ease, computer systems can be commandeered with only a few taps, &c. -- but these are not terribly insulting when left out in the open, and they do not interfere with the political caste that keeps the action story moving. Towards the end things become a little less thoughtful and it becomes harder to invest without a grounding in how the rules work for the new technologies that have been introduced, but it never descends to dullness.Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L. Jackson do well in their roles but those roles, while significant, are never explained or fleshed out much, and they sometimes seem to be there largely to look impressive each in their own way. Gwyneth Paltrow extends the cast of all-stars with a good performance as Pepper Pots, though she seems a little stuck on the note of ""beleaguered."" It's a nice surprise to see Garry Shandling show up as a fun comic-relief senator.This was great entertainment and well ahead of a standard issue genre action or superhero adaptation picture, served effective and real wit, good dramatic sub-plotting, and an extremely memorable lead performance from Downey that does a huge amount to make some scenes that would otherwise be laughably absurd very believable.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 2 Movie Review,"Iron Man 2, arguably one of the most anticipated movies of the summer, opens next week. And with its opening, the summer blockbuster season starts in earnest. And I was so excited, I took a relatively long trip to see this movie early.And what a way to start off the movie season.The first Iron Man movie, I think, came as a surprise to many movie fans. Yes, as a member of the Avengers, Iron Man is important in the Marvel Comics Universe, but usually takes a back seat to the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, the X-Men, and of course, Spider-Man.But the first Iron Man movie was comic book perfection. Short of the Dark Knight and possibly Spider-Man 2, it may have been the best superhero movie ever, depending on who is making the argument. It took a relatively unknown character in Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of the self-loathing, narcissistic playboy billionaire Tony Stark, and brought the story t the masses. The introduction story was ideal in every way. And Stark's progression from a selfish genius to a superhero is unlike most we see in movies.And taking that all into consideration, it is incredible that Iron Man 2 out duels its predecessor.More at http://neoavatara.com/blog/?p=10808",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

A Worthy Sequel that Expands the Marvel Cinematic Universe,"Iron Man 2, directed by Jon Favreau and starring Robert Downey Jr. Once again as Tony Stark, is a worthy sequel that expands the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

More mega-budget metallic mayhem.,"The sequel to the excellent Marvel adaptation Iron Man isn't as strong as the original in the story department, being a fairly routine 'villains vs good guy' tale that does little to develop the central character; it also suffers from some interminably inane dialogue (people are talking, but they don't really seem to be saying much). Thankfully, the film compensates somewhat in terms of sheer spectacle and excitement (and I'm not just talking about Scarlett Johansson in a figure-hugging leather catsuit!).The first of Iron Man 2's incredible action set-pieces introduces Mickey Rourke's Russian villain Ivan Vanko, who causes mayhem during the Monaco Grand Prix in an effort to kill Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and thus avenge his scientist father, who he believes was cheated outed of fame and fortune by Tony's father Howard. He fails of course, but not until he's trashed several F1 cars mid-race, slicing them in half with his 'power-whips'. Great stuff!Vanko is given another chance at killing the playboy billionaire turned superhero when unscrupulous weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) busts him out of jail and gives him the means necessary to develop an army of drones. The film culminates with the inevitable smack-down between Iron Man and Vanko's obedient robot warriors, a satisfyingly chaotic battle full of big guns, grinding metal, and destruction on a massive scale.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

""" If I knew I could trust the military, I would gladly give them the weapon ""","From the incredible, innovative and often futurist mind of comic book artist, Stand Lee, comes this sequel to his hero. The Film is called "" Iron Man II. "" Director Jon Theroux, follows the basic character Iron Man, and challenges him with several new problems at once. First the alter ego of the Iron Man, Mr. Tony Stark, (Robert Downey) learns, the atomic power pack in his chest is not only saving his life, but is killing him at the same time. Secondly, his best friend, Lt. Col James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) is covering for his friend but is also trying to secure one of the top secret iron man suits for the military and with the help of Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) may well succeed. Lastly, there is the main frame heavy, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke, excellent acting), who vows to destroy Stark for betraying his father. Samuel L. Jackson, John Slattery, Garry Shandling and even Stan Lee all make cameo roles. The film is action packed, exciting, and promotes audiences to expect more in the following sequel. If that isn't enough, there is Scarlett Johansson and Gwyneth Paltrow who provide eye-candy with a attitude and a powerful executive allure for Stark.

Too fractured,"Picking up where the first Iron Man film left off this film continues the tale of Tony Stark, the rich and somewhat eccentric inventor of technologies most people can only dream of.Being a typical action film this one is filled to the rim with explosions, chases, fire and women that are too beautiful to actually exist. There is a story line and it isn't half bad - it's enough for a decent film. But, and this is a major but, as it tries to mimic the stories from the cartoons it skips through this story a bit too quickly at times leaving gaping holes and making the film feel like running across a giant Swiss cheese where you have to jump the holes to make it to the other side.The appearing Nemesis is fun to watch and the trails that are left to the Avengers are clear enough - but fitting, somewhat. Appearance of most characters is good - just a few that are a bit dodgy (Johansson didn't really work for me in this one) All in all, this is popcorn cinema, but not the best of it. It can be enjoyed, but there's better things out there to enjoy.

As far as having Scarlett Johanson being as an action heroine - not really believable! Still great to look at though - blonde or brunette.

"""Iron Man 2""-  An entertaining but uneven follow-up.","One of the more divisive and maligned entries in Marvel's ever- growing Cinematic Universe, 2010's ""Iron Man 2"" was a strange beast indeed. Filled with eye-popping visuals and phenomenal performances, yet suffering various issues with pace and focus, the film has gone on to become one of those rare examples of a ""Marvel blunder""- one of the only entries in the entire series that isn't universally hailed for its high quality. And yet, I can't help but feel it was too harshly judged and receives far too little credit for its major accomplishments. In the grand scheme of things, sure it might be in the bottom tier for the phenomenal franchise... but it's certainly also an entertaining and oft-thrilling installment that's worth giving a second shot to if you haven't seen it in a while.Things are changing for Tony Stark, once again played to perfection by Robert Downey Jr. The public adores him and his superhero alter-ego ""Iron Man"", he's virtually untouchable by any government agency, and he's just kick-started a year long convention (Stark Expo) that is set to bring together the greatest minds in science and development. Yet not all is well... he's recently discovered that he is being slowly poisoned by the arc-reactor that keeps him alive (the thing that is saving him is also killing him in an ironic twist), he's contending with vile corporate rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), and a new villain has emerged with ties to his own past- Ivan Vanko, also known as ""Whiplash"", portrayed by the delightful Mickey Rourke. Stark must rely on his cunning to juggle these intertwining developments in order to save not only the world once again... but to also save himself.The film is often cited as being a disappointment for placing too much focus on setting-up and ""sequel baiting"" the various upcoming releases that were set to follow, leading to an overstuffed story-line that sometimes confused rather than enthralled. And to an extend, I can see the problem and admit its presence. Certain scenes do feel out of place and a little too much focus is given to secondary characters like Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), often at the expense of screen time for more primary characters. Motivation becomes a bit iffy at times, and some of the major sub-plots at play often go for long stretches without being addressed.And yet... I don't see it as that big of a problem. Sure, it can be annoying during a few key scenes, but to me, there's just too much to like here to dismiss the entire experience. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, as they say. And its admitted problems with structure and focus cannot stop top-notch performances, wonderful visual direction and some clever writing from shining through.Everyone is at the top of their game here. Downey had by this time cemented himself as the perfect player fir the role of Stark, and he is magnificent. He was born to play this role. Rockwell and Rourke make for a great evil duo, both playing their parts uniquely... Rockwell as a hammy and troubled businessman that feels like what Tony would have become if he never ""grew up"", and Rouke as a hulking, seething mountain of a man with a major chip on his shoulder... but also a savage sense of humor. Gwyneth Paltrow and Johansson round out the major players as the women supporting Stark- Pepper Potts and the aforementioned Romanoff. They both do great work here- especially Johansson who is revealed to of course be an undercover SHIELD agent (that's not spoiling anything, it's in the trailer) that would go on to become a greater presence in future films. Don Cheadle takes on the part of James Rhodes from original actor Terrance Howard, and I think he improves on the part in every way. Howard introduced good-ole Rhodey... Cheadle defined him. And even minor roles by the likes of Jackson and director Jon Favreau get a lot of good business in the film.Visually, the film is stunning thanks to director Favreau's keen eye for thrilling and exciting imagery. I particularly admire how he is not just content in filming everything in bland, shaky closeup. He's a director that likes to give you long, wide shots where you can appreciate the beauty of the carnage and the furious action, and only relies on shaky-cam to emphasize emotion and desperation in a few calculate, key moments. He also has a knack for expertly combining practical and digital effects, leading to a near-perfect blend that really pulls you into the film. It is a shame that after this movie, he took a step back into a producing role for the series- his work as a director was inspired.Finally, despite some hiccups in the pacing and structure, I actually quite liked the script by Justin Theroux, who had previously worked with Downey on ""Tropic Thunder."" There's some really great quiet moments and a lot of genuinely entertaining beats of humor that I appreciated. One stand-out sequence involving a drunken brawl between Stark and Rhodes, both in Iron Man armors was one of the highlights. And I also really gotta commend Theroux's ability to constantly build and ratchet up tension... the entire film seems like its building to the finale in a very appropriate and organic way, and when it finally pays off in a flurry of explosions and effects, it feels earned.In the end, ""Iron Man 2"" might not have quite been the film we wanted. But it was still a great time at the movies. It has some fundamental flaws that will certainly turn a portion of audiences off, but I think if you can soldier past those issues, there's too much here to like to not have a great time. It's not perfect, but it's still perfect fun. I give it a solid 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 2 - 6.6/10,"6.6/101. Overall Plot - 7/10
I like how this is a good heroes journey story. The way Tony goes from an invincible hero, to being sick, being full of himself, and not caring about much. To having to get back up again. And to honor his father's legacy, and be a hero. I really like the idea of him being sick, and trying everything to find a cure.Another plot point I really like is the involvement of Shield. It does some really good world building with it.The main villain being whiplash and Justin Hammer, I just don't really care for. It's just kind of boring2. Entertainment / Engagement - 7/10
I would put this lower, because the movie is kind of boring throughout. But I do really like the final fight scene, and think it is very entertaining. Watching War Machine and Iron Man fight together is very fun to watch.3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 6/10
I like how they go more in depth between Stark and his dads relationship. You learn along side with Tony about how they were as father and son.The villains reason for being the bad guy aren't much to care for, and is hard to get invested into.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 6/10
I would say the theme for this one is, living up to your legacy. Because it's about Tony trying to make right, and finish what his father started.I love how they go deeper into Tony Stark's relationships. And how we see more of Stark's problems he deals with.5. Characters - 7/10
I really like the inclusion of more of Shield, and all those characters. I like the introduction of Black Widow in this movie. And even the teases of future characters.Rhodey is a lot better in this movie. But that could just be because of the recast.I don't really care for Whiplash and Justin Hammer being the villains in this. Hammer is just super pretentious and annoying, but he's supposed to be that way so it's fine.I like Tony's character arc in this movie. He goes through the heroes journey very well. And the struggles he is dealing with are very accurate to the character.I also really like Rhodey's storyline in this, and how he develops more as a character, and becomes the War Machine.I don't like the design for Iron Man's suits in this one as much as the first one. They seem more bulky and plasticky, rather then the sleek original.6. Acting / Writing - 9/10
All the actors are good in their roles. Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko or Whiplash seems pretty dull throughout. He's supposed to be angry and want revenge, but it doesn't seem that way.Don Cheadle as Rhodey is so much better. I really like how when he first comes on screen he says, ""Look, it's me, I'm here, drop it, let's move on"". I think that's funny because they are kind of acknowledging the recast.7. Cinematography - 8/10
Love the camera shots in this. Especially for fight and flying scenes. They are filmed in a way that makes it seem significantly more realistic. The only thing I don't like is how, because it looks more realistic, sometimes the camera shakes a lot more when it's zoomed in. And I hate when cameras shake, because it blurs and hides the finer details of shots.8. Score - 6/10
Average Iron Man music. Is good but nothing notably crazy good. Definitely not as good as the first Iron Man film.9. Editing / Pace - 6/10
The editing is done very well, with lots of cool shots during cool scenes.The pacing in this movie is horrible. It starts out very slow and is that way through most the film. Then right before the climax it mega speeds up, and is fast the rest of the film. That's just not a good way to tell a story.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 10/10
The effects in this movie are so good. It is basically as good as it is gonna get. Everything looks so good, and there aren't any noticeably bad things.Any problem I had with CGI in the first Iron Man is fixed in this one.Average Score:
7.2/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:
6.6/10
This is an incredibly mediocre movie. The only thing it has going for it is the final fight. It's still pretty enjoyable to watch, and is a must watch if you like the Iron Man character. I really enjoy the addition and introduction of some side characters like Natasha Romanoff. And I love Rhodey in this movie. Making him fight along side Iron Man as War Machine is very cool.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A fantastic movie which defies the preconception of the sequel.,"Whenever a stand-alone movie becomes a sequel, frequent moviegoers cannot help but cringe at the idea of having their favorite films ruined by the mere greed of movie studios. Thankfully, fans of Iron Man were able to have greater hopes than those of other movies turned sequel due to the abundance of material available via the original Marvel comics, thus giving birth to the illustrious sequel that is Iron Man 2. This superhero flick opens up as a Russian television set portrays Tony Stark(brilliantly portrayed by Robert Downey Jr.) revealing himself as Iron Man during a press conference. Moments later, the setting contrasts itself dramatically as the film captures the final words of an elderly Russian man towards his son, Ivan Vanko(Mickey Rourke). With the assistance of his father's blueprints, Ivan creates his own version of Stark's Arc Reactor with the intent of weaponizing it for his own purposes.Anybody who has seen the film can more than happily realize the fact that Robert Downey Jr. was a phenomenal choice for the portrayal of Tony Stark. While watching the movie, it appears as if he has completely become Tony Stark, possessing every single quirk that the billionaire playboy shows. His lines move naturally with a tone of voice one would expect from the overly arrogant Stark. However, what truly stood out to me in Downey's acting style is his portrayal of Stark's descent into a state of weakness. Without revealing further pieces of the plot, I can assure any moviegoer that Downey allows you to feel a conflict between laughing at Stark's actions and feeling absolute sympathy. I can firmly state that, without Downey, the character of Tony Stark would not have captivated me nearly as much as it does now.When it comes to costumes, anybody can agree that we would all pay an extremely large amount of money to obtain one of Stark's suits. They are simply some of the most interesting pieces of technology we can even imagine, while also looking simply fantastic. In Iron Man 2, we are introduced to Stark's different models for his Iron Man suit, each showing a different taste which I greatly enjoy. Also, we are introduced to the creation of Ivan's 'suit', which consists mainly of two electrified whips with an amazing capacity for destruction. All in all, the ability for the costume designer to transform the original drawings of these suits from the comics into these realistic suits of metal interests me to no end. If there is anything to take from the movie, it is the ingenuity that is put behind every small detail.In its entirety, Iron Man 2 was an amazing movie which defied the preconception of the typical sequel. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first movie, and especially to those who recently saw the amazing movie, The Avengers. As my favorite Avenger, I could not possibly see myself enjoying the movie itself without first both experiencing and loving both movies of the Iron Man series. In my opinion, Iron Man 2 deserves an 8.5/10 as it may not be perfect, but it is truly an amazing film.I shall be anxiously waiting for the release of Iron Man 3 in 2013.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Tony Stark leads strong in entertaining follow up,"I picked up an old copy of Total Film magazine (issue 160) the other day which was promoting the future 100 and Jon Favreau, Iron man 1 and 2 director said ""The big challenge is how do you not have it be two guys in suits hitting each other? I've done that. I don't want to do more of it."" I read this after watching the 2010 smash on DVD and was rather surprised as there was plenty of guys in suits hitting each other, particularly at Iron man's own home which begs the question, how different is this to the first one? The first Iron man shook up the superhero summer two years ago which was overshadowed by the Dark Knight but it was still a great blockbuster and a great story, being funny, light hearted and 100% action packed. And although this release is fun entertainment, it falls quite short of the bar the first one raised.Opening with star of the moment Mickey Rourke being a recluse and formulating a plan to attack Iron Man the story is laid ahead for us and soon we are with superhero Tony Stark, a legendry comic book character and thanks to Robert Downey Jr, an icon of masculine bravado and cocky swagger that you cannot hate him for. He has created a genius and if there was ever a reason to go see a film for the best comic book real world character, here it is.Rourke as Whiplash has been praised by many, certainly his evilness and swagger is excellent but in relation to the story his motivation to go after Stark seemed rather strange.Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L Jackson set up the upcoming Avengers film nicely with carefully reserved performances giving us all something to look forward to.The story of Iron man 2 sees Stark living with himself as a now global superstar and the difficulties he conceals behind the scenes with his health, well being and fame.There are a few lapses in action sequences which are all rather flashy rather than substantial in the moment fights. The Monaco grand prix is impressive and as mentioned the big suit fight in the house is rather good.The great quality of this action film is it has a deeper meaning to a popcorn film. It feels more than a warm relaxing entertainer than a franchise maker. Sure Iron Man is glorified to the heavens in occasional conventional action battles and 'emotional' confrontations with friends and fans but this all feels genuinely authentic and exciting, the icing on the cake if you will and where you may read reviews with 3 out of 5 stars this deserves an extra one for being pure guilty and entertaining indulgence.And yes, it is by no means a match for the 2008 release but for a laugh, for entertainment and for something containing one of the best comic book creations in Tony Stark, this is certainly worth catching",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron Man 2 Review,"In the first Iron Man film, we saw an arms manufacturer develop a conscience and become a hero trying to clean up the mess his company left behind. A follow-up was inevitable, and Iron Man 2 would continue to track Tony Stark's moral journey through even more highs and lows.Among the high points of the film, Iron Man confronts a new villain that pops up out of the blue, who trashes some race cars and sends them flying down the track. The film's climax pits Iron Man against a whole contingent of drones, before Iron Man and War Machine team up in an explosive all-out fighting sequence. All this action is really cool, but the film still dishes out plenty of amusing banter and interesting thematic material to keep everything even.Unfortunately, the film suffers a few low points. In spite of the dramatic issues the film tackles, the pacing is not always perfect; scenes in-between the action can be a hit-or-a-miss. This is because the film juggles a lot of different things in its plot. It is notable how the film continues to track Tony Stark's growth, for even though he embraced a new identity as a hero, he still has his ego to contend with, and it gets him into all kinds of trouble in this film. These scenes do dig up significant levels of conflict, and ultimately, it presents a compelling account of how Tony's obsession with technology and fame gradually erodes his soul and isolates him from the people around him. However, the film also tosses in other random elements - including a Russian bad guy who has no real relevance to the story's main conflicts, and some random scenes with Black Widow and Nick Fury that only serve to whet audiences' appetites for 2012's Avengers. In spite of these haphazard plot points, the film doesn't necessarily congeal well, making for a rather uneven story.Fortunately, the film looks good, with decent photography and editing. Robert Downey Jr. continues to excel as the main character, while Gweneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Johansson, and Samuel L. Jackson are all fun to watch. Mickey Rourke has some cheesy parts (especially with his ""I vant my boid"" line), but I think he's good most of the time. Writing is okay, but probably could have used more refinement. This production features good-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. John Debney's music score is pretty awesome.Iron Man 2 is decently-entertaining and its story has a few significant points to make, but it is rather mixed, and it has led many viewers to regard it as an inferior sequel. Regardless of its issues, I find the film perfectly enjoyable.4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Mixed | Film: Very Good)",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
New fan of Robert Downey Jr.,"As a teenager, I watch tons of movies and TV shows. Typically I don't care enough to research the actors. For some reason. I felt the need to read about Robert Downey's background. Wow! He has been through a lot. As a teen, I avoid drugs and that culture and could never imagine being an addict, but Robert Downey lived that life and not only survived, but came back stronger than ever. It seems those experiences have made into a special kind of actor and the perfect one for Iron Man. I definitely want to explore more of his films and wish him good health and a long life so his talents can continue to shine. I would recommend all the Iron Man films to all viewers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Expect to be disappointed.,"Like Transformers 2. Bigger budget, more big names, more special effects. Less of a coherent story to make it all work.Shoehorn Scarlett Johansson into the plot like they shoehorned her into a leather suit. Not because it makes sense to the movie. Just because it makes sense to the 18-35male demographic. Figuring out how to use her in the movie appeared to be an after though.If you go in expecting to be disappointed that it doesn't re-capture that feeling you got from the first Ironman you should not be too disappointed as it will meet your expectations. Just go in expecting to see more special effects and try hard to ignore the seemingly thrown together scenes and rambling dialog.I think Mikey Rourke gets the award for worst casting here by far. As a bad guy he was utterly boring! He seemed to be phoning it in most scenes. Only showing up at the set to collect his paycheck. This movie could have been much better with a more inspiring bad guy. Just about anyone would have been better than Rourke IMHO.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A step down, but still fun","Not as good as the first one, but still a pretty solid romp. It's main problem is it's trying to set up ""The Avengers"" in the same way ""Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice"" was trying to set up the next 20 films down the line, which in both cases, they thankfully learned from. There's enough plots in this movie to make at least 3 movies. The stuff with Black Widow and Whiplash is pretty good and really fun, but in terms of plot, it doesn't really deliver.

The plot isn't as interesting, or all that creative, but it's done well enough that I didn't ever feel bored; though some of the pacing is off.I like Don Cheadle so it's good to see him come in, even if his character is rather forgettable.

As all sequels go...,"It starts with a bang from the great moves by Robert Downey Jr. and the witty one liners. Followed by the crazy iron man tricks. Slightly better than the first movie in terms of action. What it really lacks is a true storyline. While some may say it definitely is better than the first I beg to differ. Robert Downey Jr. simply manages to play a drunk crazy old rich fool who thinks he knows it all. The villain is smart and sometimes more appealing that Mr. Stark. Scarlett Johansson is as gorgeous as ever. She didn't look this good even in Lost in Translation. The action is great, the story decent the movie above average.

Solid,"Iron Man 2 is not The Dark Knight. And it shouldn't be.For my money, I can't think of a movie that better embodies the term ""popcorn flick."" Like its predecessor, this one is all about fun. There are rock 'em sock 'em explosions aplenty, as well as some slickly filmed fight sequences that are quite memorable (but, honestly, aren't earth-shattering when compared to any number of other uber-energetic comic book films of the last decade). Don't be fooled, though; this sequel to the 2008 hit actually builds on the mythos of Tony Stark in some welcome ways.Front and center in this particular feature is ""the past""—that is, it's very much focused on Howard Stark (Tony's father) and his vision of a futuristic society that thrives on the energy derived from his Arc Reactor. There are also some other juicy tidbits we learn about Stark Sr., not the smallest of which has a little something to do with rewriting the periodic table. Also thrown into the mix is a physicist who worked with Howard back in the day. He's a disgruntled Russian who feels he's been slighted because—among other things—of Tony's success. He's got a son of his own named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), and he's determined to avenge his father's legacy at all costs. Yes, the plot is driven by a stereotypical variation on the revenge story we're all familiar with, but, given the already superficial nature of the film (which, let's be honest, we all expected), it works well.Iron Man 2, quite simply, does everything a competent sequel should. In this case, it further highlights the flaws of its protagonist, and it builds on the comedy/action pairing that made the original film so successful. It even ties in new characters—such as Nick Fury and Natasha Romanoff—who are fairly interesting in their own right while settting itself up for a third film that will (hopefully) continue the trend.Despite all its upward momentum, Iron Man 2 does falter from time to time. As is the case with many-a-movie, our hero solves seemingly impossible ""puzzles"" in record time (here, we're talking about scientific enigmas that can only be deciphered with the use of improvised proton accelerators). This directly correlates with a looming sense of danger—developed by a specific plot element that I won't ruin here—that's established early in the film, and, because of this ridiculously absurd ""quick fix,"" said surprisingly tangible sense of dread is undercut in an extraordinarily premature manner.But, again, what did you expect? This is Iron Man 2, not the philosophical diatribe of a makeup wearing psychopath. As tired as I am of this clichéd phrase, it still applies: ""It is what it is."" Because of that, there should be zero complaints.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Waste Of Talent, Script And Time","This is one of the dumbest and most painful to watch movies in it's genre today. There is so much potential here, that has masterfully been laid to waste here. Robert Downey Jr. played Tony Stark as the cliché arrogant, spoilt rich-kid in the first movie. In the second add morose, self-destructive dumbass to the list.Half of the movie is wasted on his mood swings and substance abuse. A little ::too close:: to reality.The chemistry between Pepper and Tony Stark --so does not work. The back-n-forth, him grovelling at her feet, is so old and preposterous it makes you cringe and hate both of them!. Scarlett Johansen's character is wholly redundant. It was plainly injected to add sex appeal and as it plays out, chubby Johansen looking up at the camera for 3 seconds, after ever take down, as if she is expecting the audience to cheer for her, is asinine shtick. Very painful.The only silver lining is Mickey Rourke's character. He is the only guy who seems to take this movie-making business seriously. He did full justice to the measly air-time they gave his character. Had he been given as much lines as... Pepper Potts, he would have stolen the movie from everybody.The movie is dull, slow, painful and insulting.

Inferior sequel,"Iron Man was always going to be a tough act to follow, and I feel that this film wisely goes down the light-hearted route. Plenty of gags, along with lots of action to keep the kids happy, although Tony Stark himself just doesn't seem to generate the same charisma as in the first film. Sam Rockwell played his 'love to hate' character Justin Hammer expertly, although elsewhere James Rhodes/War Machine being played by a different actor to the first film felt oddly disappointing...",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A solid sequel to the movie that started the MCU.,This was a solid follow up to the original Iron Man and the movie that started the whole MCU. There is a lot of great action scenes and some awesome humor.

"Good, but a lot to follow","In light of the many fabulous Marvel Universe movies that have been released since 2010, ""Iron Man 2"" is part of the bottom half. Still, it's quite a good movie, even though it can be hard to follow. There are a lot of plot lines: the Whiplash line, the obligatory evil capitalist line, the relationship with Pepper Potts line, the impending mortality line, the unresolved father issues line, the battle with Congress and the military line, and the Nick Fury agent of S. H. I. E. L. D. line. Whew! A slightly simpler plot might've made this a better film, but I understand you need a richer tapestry once the foundations of the characters have been set. The biggest improvement they could've made was giving Mickey Rourke a bigger part. He's squeezed tightly by the rest of the story, but ""Iron Man 2"" is much better than 95% of the sequels out there.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Worth watching,It's worth watching to see what happens to Stark and everyone else that was in the first film. One can watch this movie at any time of the day. It would be best to watch the first film to know what happened. There are some things that just wont make sense if you haven't seen the first film yet. Children can watch this movie pretty much at any age. But please parents make sure that your children can watch this type of action pack movie. This movie is at least 8 out of 10 stars. There is a lot of action within the movie. To me this movie is on that list of movies that can be watched multiple times within the year or even years.

"Personally, I thought it was better than the first","I know I will get a lot of hate for this, but I actually liked this movie more than the first. Now I'm not saying that this film is better than the first, I guess in terms of writing, this is the worst film. However, I had more fun watching this movie. To me, this was the more fun of the two.Now it isn't a perfect film by any means. Pepper Potts wasn't great in the first film, but in this film she seems to have two modes. She's either annoying, or she is a complete idiot. I'm sorry, but if a droid ten feet away from me begins beeping and blinking red, I won't just stand there and look at it, I'm running away as fast as I can. Also, like the first film, there is way more talking then action, in fact there's even less action in this film.However that brings me into the good stuff. While this film has more talking than action, I actually liked the talking. Robert Downey Jr. was hilarious, he always had me smiling. And because of this, despite Stark still being a douche, I liked him a lot more. The film is just full of witty banter. So I liked when there was action and when there wasn't action. And once again my favorite character was Rhodey, once again reminding me of myself. Scarlett Johansen was hot. The two villains made the perfect antagonist. Ivan was intimidating, and Hammer was funny. And I liked the story. It's basically part Iron Man movie, part trailer for the Avengers, and for me it worked.I can't really see why this film was hated by so many people. Sure it has good reviews, and most people seem to like it. But of all the Avengers movies, this one seems to get the most hate. I really enjoyed this movie, it isn't perfect, and the first film is probably a better film, but I enjoyed this movie more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Ambitiously Bigger, but Better?","My memories of the original ""Iron Man"" are generally limited to the notion that I had a good time watching it, and that, for a big-screen translation of a popular comic-book property, it was more cohesive and clever (and boasting a far finer cast) than its less-successful Marvel brethren (think ""The Punisher"" and ""Incredible Hulk""). While it didn't come close to touching ""The Dark Knight"" (which is probably an unfair comparison for two wildly different superheroes), it was entertaining in a breezy, thrilling manner that got good mileage out of Robert Downey Jr.'s infectious, snarky charisma. ""Iron Man 2"" continues this cycle with consistent results: the action sequences are frantic and fast-paced without being incoherent; the cast well-chosen (with a barnstorming Mickey Rourke stealing the show); and the integration of CGI convincingly rendered. As both a continuation of the plot threads and character arcs in the original and as a standalone film, ""Iron Man 2"" is a solid, consistently entertaining effort that cements one-time indie darling Jon Favreau (who wrote and starred in the cult classic ""Swingers"") as the directorial antithesis of Michael Bay's sloppy, migraine-inducing action style. That being said, there is a nagging sense of lack within the proceedings, as though screenwriter Justin Theroux (""Tropic Thunder""), in an attempt to outdo the original, crammed in as many characters and subplots as possible simply to keep the film busy; while there are many Howard Hawks-ian comedic exchanges that recall the screwball comedies of the 1940s and '50s (many belonging to Downey and Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts), there are just as many characters who feel less than necessary (despite their considerable appeal, Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson don't have much bearing on the film's outcome). If ""Iron Man 2"" is flawed for this reason alone, then that still makes it better (and certainly more ambitious) than most of this summer's blockbuster fodder.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as the 1st film,"Iron Man 2 fell quite short of its predecessor. You still have the charisma and strong performance from Robert Downey Jr. And Scarlett Johansson and Samuel L Jackson are a welcome addition. But the plot is flimsy at best. The main antagonist is weak and unimpressive. Mickey Rourke's character's motivation is quickly explained in 30 seconds and the start of the film offered little context or explanation and now he's the main threat? He was so unimpressive that he should have been someone Ironman wiped out in the first 5 minutes.

The only thing that certain people criticize is the each individual plot, each individual had their own Story elements, But in My opinion it was Better like that. You need a film with great Character development, not just ACTION ACTION ACTION. The Action needs to Blend in with the story, it's like a song same beat, but Just snaps & wakes you up. ROBERT DOWNERY JR. IS the BEST Tony Stark In Marvel universal, The IRON MAN is so BAD-A**, And the race track OMG it's so SEXY. Don Cheadle: WAR MACHINE/RHODES Was used great in my opinion, I sort of Miss Terrance Howard, cause he carried that swag, but other wise WAR MACHINE Suit looks BAD-A** Etc, don't want spoil. MICKEY: WHIPLASH, I Thought was a smooth Criminal. In the Movie they used him as a smooth guy who wants vengeance on the STARK family, Mickey did a well done expression with him, but he was still a bad a** too. THE BLACK WIDOW chick, All I have to say is WOW. Samuel L. JACKSON: As NICK FURY, I Liked how they used him in a way and Black widow to assemble the AVENGERS ( The superhero teams, THOR, CAPTAIN America, HULK & IRON MAN & MORE) Justin HAMMER Was like an opposite side of TONY STARK, his acting was spot on to. IT Just had a great cast. including Pepperpotts. The thing I Wish was a little longer was the end battle between The 3.

Just as good as Transformers 2?

And you scumbags out there didn't even pick ""Old Dogs"", ""Land of the Lost"", ""G.I. Joe: Rise of Cobra"", or ""All About Steve"" hell, even Alvin and the Chipmunks 2 for that award!! But no, you're just too stupid to do so and picked my all-time favorite movie.The people of the Razzie Awards are just a bunch of lame ass people who have no acclaim for movies. I'm pretty sure that Michael Bay threw his Razzie Award in the trash can for what they've done.I know a lot of Transformers fans out there in the world are probably mad from what they've seen. They'll probably rant on them pretty soon if they get a chance to do so. I mean, Transformers 2 for Worst Picture? That is just sad. Transformers 2 haters can shut up for a while. I prefer this movie than ""Alvin and the Chipmunks 2"" because that movie has one of the worst endings I've seen.Seriously, the Razzie Awards sucks now, because of this. I'm going to give them two middle fingers for saying that. Transformers 2 gets two thumbs up as well.The bottom line: Golden Raspberry Awards SUCK!!!!!

Apart from that, there's nothing else of merit I can say really so I'll just say some more negative stuff. The plot was just so stupid and so many of the characters were just SO obvious (as in you get pretty much the same character in other films).

Great Addition to Marvel.  Not so much to Iron Man.,"Tony Stark. I started reading comics since I could read (circa 1989) and Iron Man didn't really catch my eye because he had more depth than most of the comics. And as a kid, I didn't like depth outside of explosion from ordnance and impact action. Iron Man had a problem that just didn't interest me and that problem really took a toll on issues. That problem was ALCOHOLISM. This is what separated Iron Man from other super heroes. (That and he wasn't induced with super powers, but enough with semantics). So I am going to open this up with; Why the hell is Stark not an alcoholic in this. They replaced his alcoholism with egotism. But - he was an ego in the comics too...No, I won't bash this on stance of being a comic-nerd. But I will say this. Iron Man 2 should be called: Avengers Initiative Initiative. It had more bearing with the Avengers than it did with the actual Iron Man. The movie has a lot to tell and it tells it pretty well. Stark is under fire from Congress for owning and monopolizing the MOBILE SUIT WEAPON, Iron Man. His Arc-Core also seems to be slowly killing him and he still has to maintain Stark Industries along with policing with Iron Man. The action has about the same pace as the first movie. Maybe even weaker? I can't say that though, it does a decent job at delivering, but Iron Man doesn't really face many humans in this one, like he did in the first one.The effects are outstanding of course, with plenty of effects to choose from. From multiple IRON MAN suit designs (which made Iron Man so cool EARLY on in the original comics) and explosions and gun fire. The cast is stellar; everyone does their part well. The director even plays a 400% more direct roll in this movie and does it really well. You will hold no ill-will toward Jon for being more of a ham in this movie. He provides key comedy relief.Don Cheadle plays the new War Machine. A face I didn't really like when I heard about the change, but he does a great job none the less. As far as the rest, if you're a comic book fan and eagerly await the following Marvel movies to bring The Avengers to Fruition, then you will have to see this. If you're just an action fan that enjoys comic-book action, then this should be priority if there is nothing else out to sate your hunger. Everyone else? You can easily take a pass and not feel bad about it.Overall the movie is well done and it's tough to weigh which one was better. Both movies have great things about them. But again, I didn't feel like I was in an Iron Man movie. I felt like I was in a prologue to a prologue to the Avengers that was catered with OUTSTANDING Robert Downy Jr. Humor.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Solid sequel,"Yes, the original 'Iron Man' movie was Marvel's 'surprise hit.' They were probably going to do a sequel anyway, but I'll bet they never thought they'd be pushing so heavily towards this side of the franchise. Anyway, it's fair to say that a sequel needs to give 'the same and more' and, to be fair, 'Iron Man 2' achieves this.It's bigger, louder, more special effects and more heroes/villains added into the mix. Personally, as a casual comic book-movie fan, I quite enjoyed it. I always thought most people did, until I read the online message boards, where it turned out that opinions were pretty divided on its merits.So, just to let you know that there's a sizable proportion of people out there who will disagree with me when I say that it's a pretty fun romp. No, it's not Shakespeare and it doesn't really try to be. I guess it's supposed to appeal to young fans (dare I say male fans?) who will buy the obligatory Iron Man T-shirts, Iron Man lunchboxes and Iron Man pyjamas. No, I didn't buy any of those, but I still enjoyed the film.Unlike other superheroes (think Batman, Superman and Spiderman), the 'secret' identify of our Iron Man isn't that secret, for at the end of the original film billionaire playboy Tony Stark decided to reveal to the world that he was the man in the iron mask – so to speak. Therefore, in Iron Man 2, he's an even bigger celebrity than he was simply for being the owner of a multinational arms manufacturing firm. It's actually quite nice to see an 'alter-ego' who's actually more 'ego' than anything else. Yes, he's a bit of an idiot. You probably wouldn't see Bruce Wayne getting drunk wearing the Batsuit at a party and using his Baterang to slice watermelons thrown from an adoring crowd. You see that here.Perhaps that's Iron Man's appeal – he's a bit of a plank and we can relate to his love of adoration? He is definitely a flawed – if very lucky – individual and he makes a change from the usual brooding hermit that most superheroes are portrayed as.Naturally, it's Robert Downey Jr's charm that carries the film through, but it's fair to give his supporting cast a mention. Naturally, seeing as the film's not called 'Iron Man and Friends' they have a lot less to do and a lot less material to work with. But they do okay to play off the star. If it's not a bit odd to say that Sam Rockwell's villain came across as a bit too 'comic-booky' for my liking (yes, I know it's a movie based on a comic book) – it just felt like he was trying a bit too hard.I know 'Iron Man 2' has its critics and I guess it's not perfect, but it is fun. It's nearly two hours and I always think one of the true tests of a movie is whether if feels like its runtime. And, in my opinion, Iron Man 2 flies by like a man in a yellow and red metal suit.Bust out the popcorn and enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I guess it's the best superhero sequel blockbuster of the year.,"The Iron Man films might be my fourth favorite superhero franchise, behind Nolan's revision of Batman, the X-Men series, and the Spiderman trilogy. I enjoyed Iron Man 2 for three reasons: the strong cast, the special effects, and Robert Downey Jr. Reprising his role as Tony Stark, Downey uses his natural wittiness to maximum effect. At times though, he just comes across as a pompous asshole. His nonchalant approach to acting is entertaining to watch and makes me think he's just being himself in the roles he chooses. That being said, there's a lot of flaws and clichés in this film. Unfortunately, with these big budget blockbusters, the studio puts too many constraints on the director. Too much time is allocated to action scenes and there's way too many characters for the audience to have to care about. As with the latest Batman movies, an important supporting character had to be replaced by a similar and more talented actor than the first installment. I really hate when that happens!Iron Man 2's cast is the best I've seen in a superhero movie. Aside from Downey, the rest of thecast includes: Mickey Rourke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle, Sam Rockwell, and Samuel L. Jackson. Since none of them get enough screen-time and are given nothing to really work with here,their talents go to waste. The plot is basically just more of the same from the first. Instead of showing how Tony Stark becomes Iron Man, we now get to see how he maintains being Iron Man. Gwyneth Paltrow returns to her role of Stark's primary love interest and Scarlett Johansson plays Stark's new personal assistant. It's a shame that Scarlett is only in this movie for her sex appeal. She deserves more screen-time and a better script to work with. The two most fascinating characters are the antagonists played by Mickey Rourke and Sam Rockwell. Rourke plays a crazed Russian hellbent on revenge against Stark. He's a very intimidating and interesting character. Too bad the only things we know about him is that he has a genuine love for his father and pet bird. Rockwell, playing Stark's rival Justin Hammer, is very entertaining to watch. He has perfected the art of being a douche and the results are quite convincing.Recently, one of my favorite actors has been Don Cheadle. He replaces actor Terrence Howard as Stark's best friend, Lt. Colonel James Rhodes. This role is so meaningless that they could have found any African-American actor to play it. As with all big-budget films, a recognizable face is all that matters. For Iron Man 2, they just happened to get the popular actors who actually do have talent. That brings me to Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson. Why is he in this movie? The answer comes in 2012, in the form of another big-budget superhero movie titled ""The Avengers."" Iron Man 2 is merely the platform for introducing another huge blockbuster to the masses. These Hollywood producers and executives are smart. They don't care about bringing down the quality of one film in order to create awareness for the next. Iron Man 2 will rake in tons of money regardless of how convoluted the story becomes. More time should have been devoted toward the central plot instead of wandering off into subplots. This film would have been stronger without the additions of Scarlett's and Sam's characters. The overkill doesn't go unnoticed by everyone.I thought the first half of Iron Man 2 picked up where the first one left off. The second half got a little sloppy. The end battle scene was anticlimactic and somewhat of a letdown. It's almost like the writer ran out of ideas and settled for a disappointingly lazy climax. The first confrontation was more exciting than the last. Don't get me started on how laughable a certain (over-choreographed) fight scene is near the end of the film. It's unbelievably unconvincing and feels like it was just thrown in there to let it be known that this certain character is a bad-ass.Even with all of the negatives involved with Iron Man 2, the pros still outweigh the cons. This is a solid popcorn film that aims to entertain. The stingy film critics who don't recommend Iron Man 2 would be lying if they said there's nothing to enjoy here. It's entertaining the whole way through and provides a few laughs. The talented lead actor and director, Jon Favreau, understand that Iron Man is much more engaging without his mask on. For fun and entertainment, Iron Man is your superhero.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Marvel Cinematic Universe Marathon 2019 #4,"Iron Man 2 is a spectacular film that is superior to it's predecessor and a perfect entry in the MCU.

We Need More Downey & Rockwell Movies,"Iron Man 2 is a worthy sequel to 2008's genre-defining OG, captivating with its entertaining feats. Here, Robert Downey Jr remains the franchise's main attraction, with a magnetic performance that perfectly balances Tony Stark's convincing brilliance, addictive charm and fascinating arrogance. Marvel happily dons Downey's character with more compelling layers, as Tony's struggles with his newfound role as a superhero is spotlighted, along with his gripes against his own mortality and relationships. This exploration of Stark's dilemmas provides plenty of substance for fans to be easily invested in the persona, crucial for the Marvel saga. Apart from the storyline and arcs, Iron Man 2 deserves praise for its treatment of its supporting characters. The introduction of Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow & Don Cheadle's War Machine were absolutely well placed with no shortage of chemistry, bolstering interest on their significance in the larger MCU. Sam Rockwell was another sweet selection, showcasing another entertaining persona that challenges Stark's propensity for ego-drenched monologues, albeit the half-assed results that Rockwell makes the most of, for comedy's sake.Now, as Iron Man 2 doubles down on its character-driven narrative, the action spectacle does become a side-quest, falling short on the promise of superhero mayhem. With such a small dose of mano-a-manos, the lack of creativity specially in the most critical showdown, was more glaring. Missed opportunities! As for Mickey Rourke's Whiplash, his lacks menace to become a memorable antagonist, obviously outclassed by his archenemy.Nevertheless, Iron Man 2 succeeds in entertaining its audience by enriching its already engrossing characters, while establishing new heroes that are a breeze to rally behind. Its humor & emotional-charged narrative and strong performances keep the picture engaging, even if the action and villains fail to leave a lasting impression.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Changed score from 5 to 9,"Originally scored this a 5 (five!) when I watched this 11 years ago. I don't know why I was so harsh on it, I think it had a lot to do with not liking Mickey Rourke as the villain with his electric whips, or the army of drones that were too similar to Iron Man's suit, or even Sam Rockwell as an antagonist. For sure I was deeply disappointed (and to some degree still am) that Terrence Howard was replaced as Rhodes- but I appreciate Don Cheadle's take on the role. Maybe my expectations were just too high and I wanted a grittier follow up to Iron Man. Whatever the case may be, I just watched it again for the first time in 11 years (as I am watching all the MCU films in MCU timeline order) and I really enjoyed this film. The character development, the character interaction, the introduction of Black Widow, the early Nick Fury appearance, the humor... all in retrospect, this is actually a pretty good installment. And after I watched the deleted and alternate scenes, I got a great appreciation for the editor and director for leaving those scenes on the cutting room floor- it was a good call because those scenes would have negatively impacted the pacing, or been over the top with the corniness.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as Good as the First But Still a Fun Time,"This movies doesn't have the same growth and character moments that the first film has. In fact to some degree this film is a regression in development for the main character which makes sense but can be painful to watch. The conflicts of the movie also seem a little all over the place with the two antagonist, civil conflict, and internal conflict of the main character. There is a lot going on and while in the end it works well enough none of these individual aspects feel on their own exemplarily like the conflict in the first film.However it is still a good time with a lot of funny moments that work to balance the more serious ones. Along with the tension caused by civil fighting creates fun moments of growth though out the film. Overall its not a bad film by any means however as a follow up for the first movie it falls a little short due to how good it was.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Another Score for Marvel,"""Iron Man 2"" is the third chapter in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, i.e. the third Marvel Comics movie produced in-house at Marvel Studios. This second episode of ""Iron Man"" sees Robert Downey, Jr. turn out a strong performance as Tony Stark, and the cast of the film does a similarly grand job as that of the original.One notable change in the movie is that Col. James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes is now played by Don Cheadle, as opposed to Terrence Howard who filled the role in the first ""Iron Man"" film. Both Howard and Cheadle turn out strong performances in this role, and it's hard to say which does a better job, but it is a bit of a glaring change, with Cheadle looking so dissimilar from Howard.The rest of the cast all do quite well in this movie, including Gwyneth Paltrow, reprising her role as Pepper Potts, and Mickey Rourke who plays the film's villain, Ivan Vanko (a character who features characteristics of both the Crimson Dynamo and Whiplash, villains from the Iron Man comic books).All in all this film is a strong chapter in the MCU's ongoing Iron Man storyline. The film develops the Tony Stark character, matching it with the classic comic book Tony Stark by introducing us to not just the billionaire playboy, but also to the Stark that struggles with alcoholism and whose own contraption that saved his life is now endangering him with radiation poisoning. Both of those plot features are drawn straight from the 1980's mythology of Iron Man. Likewise, the film goes a step further by introducing us to a larger piece of the MCU puzzle by giving us more information on SHIELD and Howard Stark. Black Widow (aka Natasha Romanov, played by Scarlett Johansson) is also introduced in this movie, and is featured prominently.While it's probably fair to say that this movie falls just short of being as good as its predecessor, again, it's certainly a great, fun movie from Marvel. I rate it at 8/10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A Great Sequel that lacks a strong Antagonist,"Iron Man 2 lags behind it's prequel only in the Music Department and the Antagonist. John Debney's score doesn't have the uniqueness of Ramin Djawadi tracks. Djawadi's 'Driving with the Top Down' is an unforgettable score while nothing of Debney's is noticeable. U can hear the BGM here but it won't register in ur mind.But that's not a big deal. The problem here is that neither of the three enemy's of Stark (Ivan Vanko, Justin Hammer & Tony's Palladium core) make an impact. The impending death of Tony due to his Palladium dependent Arc-Reactor does make up for an interesting plot but it always seems like Tony will find a replacement somehow. Whereas both Vanko & Hammer are more annoying than menacing. Neither of them match up to Obadiah Stane.Apart from these two, the sequel is much better than the prequel. The first Iron Man movie has already set the bars high. The sequel takes it even further up. Especially the action sequences which are much better than the prequel. The CGI is so good that the suits look real enough. Even after a decade, the visual effects don't look dated. The story has so many plots going on. Yet Director Jon Favreau has successfully kept the focus on Tony throughout the film. Every plot is centered around tony. And RDJ, the face of MCU's Infinity Saga, just nailed it. Only if the Antagonists have been more impactful, the Sequel would have beaten the prequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Over-rated?  maybe just a bit,"Boring. Adolescent. Bad enough to be camp if one could stand Downey.

This film has the feeling of a straight to video production. If you want to get up or chat during the flick, feel free - you won't miss anything important. Uninspired scenes with dancing girls seem to abound.We are treated to endless depictions of Iron Man's pathos (well beyond Downey's range apparently,even if it was interesting - which it is not). If you want to know how bad, think Will Smith in I Am Legend.It is just amazingly silly to see the Iron Man 'hands down' flight take-off routine.

In the middle of all that, he crossed a bunch of people including a Russian guy. What? Again with the Russians. Just stop it already.

A Step in the Right Direction,"After how good Iron Man was, expectations are high for a sequel.

There just feels like no variety and it's leaning so heavily on RDJ to carry every scene. Problem is he can't be on the screen all the time and when he isn't...for me the film falls flat.War machine with Don Cheadle is perfect. His character, the suit, perfect. The dynamic with him and tony couldn't be better - so glad they recast. Almost a shame he wasn't in it a little more.As sequels go it's not bad, but it's not great either.

Expanding the Universe with Style,"Once again, I have to emphasize that Robert Downey Jr. Was the best possible choice to play Tony Stark. His performance is so natural that it is now impossible not to see the character in the actor, no matter where he is. The chemistry between actor and character is so strong that, although this film serves more as a gateway to new characters that will appear in future MCU films, this does not detract from the immersive experience provided by the cast.Iron Man 2 continues to explore Tony Stark's journey after the events of the first film. The plot introduces new challenges and characters that expand the previously established universe, keeping the narrative engaging and dynamic.The visual effects and action scenes that use increasingly crazy and interesting technologies are impressive, with combat sequences that continue to captivate. The inclusion of new characters enriches the film's universe and sets the stage for future stories.Despite being a key piece in the development of the MCU, Iron Man 2 maintains its charm and depth, offering a satisfying continuation of Tony Stark's journey and the evolution of his heroic alter ego.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A worthy but imperfect sequel,"The makers of Iron Man 2 should be commended for preserving most of the things that made part I so successful, without overdoing anything. Robert Downey Junior is wonderful as ever (though his playboy antics walk a very fine line between amusing and over-the-top). And Gwyneth Paltrow is lovely and charismatic as Pepper Pots, a rare superhero love interest who is attractive, intelligent and dignified in an understated way, which is something you don't often see in action pictures where women's independence is acceptable as an over-the-top novelty.Unfortunately, the goodwill generated by Paltrow's performance as an effortlessly worthy woman is squandered a bit on Scarlett Johanson, who is physically beautiful, but subscribes to the female-in-an-action-movie norm. She is too skinny to be a viable action hero, and dressed so slinkily that her sole function is clearly that of a sex object.The biggest problem with this movie is Samel L. Jackson, who has played the same role so many times he kills your suspension of disbelief. The man on screen is clearly Samuel L. Jackson wearing an eyepatch. His presence serves only as a distraction. Don Cheadle is a fine actor, but no better than Terrence Howard, and its a shame the filmmakers couldn't have brought him back.Otherwise, the film has some problems with logical plotting and characters' motivations aren't always clear (i.e. the brawl between Iron Men at Tony's birthday party). However, it is funny, entertaining, exciting, and subtly thoughtful, with implications about world peace and arms dealing which feels like a breath of fresh air amidst all the current action pictures' assumption that their audiences have a 2nd grade comprehension level.The bottom line is, if you liked part I, you'll enjoy part II.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Decent, necessary and stupid","Overall, a very strong sequel compared to most. I love how it really dived into tony starks egotistical side, this emphasises how much he develops in future movies, this is the part I find to be necessary. It sets his personality in stone, as if he is going to be arrogant and childish throughout future movies, which makes his leap from that so incredible. The change in actors for Rhody was great, he played a decently sized role in the movie as a whole. The dialogue was rough for some scenes, it peaked whenever Tony was arguing with pepper.The way the first introduced black widow was interesting. It wasn't bad but she didn't actually need to be in the movie, obviously she plays a huge part later. The villain is really where it fell flat for me, his motivations for being a bad guy really wasn't strong and was not highlighted nearly enough which mad it feel, for me, as if he was just bad to be bad. The action was great... a bit stupid at points. It confused me how whiplashes whips could slice straight through a car but could barely cut a millimetre through the iron man suit, but it is what it is. Decent movie 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Decent sequel,"Iron Man 2 takes a deep, dark look at the man behind Iron Man, specifically at his inner demons. We all have them, our specific regrets that make us who we are. Tony thinking his father was never fond of him nor wanted him around. The fact that alcohol becomes a crutch to lean on as he battles the fact that he might be dying, his undying love for a Ms. Pepper Potts. During a car race two new villains appear, one is obvious, Whiplash, one not so much, Justin Hammer. Unbeknownst to Tony some new friends also appear, one Black Widow and the ever present S.H.I.E.L.D. There is a lot going on in this movie, and it probably should have been longer or made into two films. Mickey Rourke was right in that his character was not fully developed, nor was just how ever pervasive Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. are. This is still a great movie. R.D.J. was born to play Tony Stark and that fact shines through. Also, this movie has the best line in all of the MCU, and was probably echoing the thoughts of every man watching the movie; when Tony first meets Natasha (calling herself Natalie here), as she is walking away says, ""I want one"".

This wasn't a good movie,"It was nice look at, the production was smooth and special effects OK. Robert Downey was great but his sarcasm and ego thing got tired after 20 minutes and unfortunately nothing else happened.This movie was way more about watching high profile actors be on screen and underachieve. First Iron Man rocks way better. Scarlett Johansen? Just there to be in black leather and kick legs. The movie got too full of itself, made you not care about anyone and was a detached mess.It seems that nobody is capable of making an action movie these days that even makes an attempt to try to have anything other than special effects or action - All action and no story is old damn news. I thought Tron was great - could've been better but it really held itself together.

Just your average film.,"I'm not the biggest fan of marvel film adaptations, but I did like Sam Raimi's spider man trilogy. I didn't have to high expectations coming into this film, so I wasn't disappointed with the results. I'm just going to say it, this film was average at best and I always forget I've even watched this film.Let's start with the characters. Tony stark still has his over confident personality, which is still better than all these other wooden characters from marvel films lately. I thought whip-lash( if thats even his name) was going to be a bad-ass after seeing the trailers. He had his moments, but in the end he was never a threat, his fight scenes were short and he was easily beaten. Black widow served no purpose in my opinion, just a woman in tight clothing, big whoop. Hammer was just another annoying and useless villain.The action scenes were poorly done, I can only seem to remember the short one at the race track and the one at the stark expo thing. The end fight scene was horrible, left on a bad note. It was mildly amusing to see war machine and iron man destroy stark's house. At least this film wasn't completely mindless like most movies targeted at the general audience.To summarize, this film is not as good as the first one, and didn't leave a lasting impression on me.

Whiplash and Hammer became less than perfect enemies in the development of Iron Man 2. This film has a new conflict with a new enemy that threatens a different side of Tony. Hammer as a business competitor while Whiplash becomes an enemy who wants to avenge him. It's a pity to see the appearance of the two enemies. At first glance, it doesn't have a good impression, especially the less promising Whiplash characters. Hammer's presence doesn't say much in the film either. Less convincing in terms of the appearance of evil characters and less convincing as evil characters. Iron Man 2 presents a conflict that is not much different from the first film by continuing Tony Stark's story as Iron Man.

Iron Man 2: A Solid Sequel with Flaws,"Hello everyone, I'm Mr. C Reviewer, tonight we are discussing the Movie, Iron Man 2. I watched it on Disney plus. The Movie first aired April 26, 2010. It has a runtime of 2 hours 4 minutes, Iron Man 2 was rated PG-13. The Movie was directed by Jon Favreau and was created by Justin Theroux and was loosely based on the comics by Stan Lee, Don Heck, Larry Lieber and Jack Kirby.Summary: Tony Stark grapples with the consequences of his dual identity as a superhero and a public figure. As the world demands accountability for his technology, Tony faces mounting pressure from the government to relinquish his Iron Man suits, which are now viewed as potential weapons of mass destruction.Review: -I appreciate how this movie begins; it opens with a scene on a television screen, showing a viewer watching Tony speak, effectively picking up the scene of Tony where the first film left off. I appreciate how the film effectively indicates the locations of its scenes within its narrative world, and I find it particularly helpful that changes in locations was clearly communicated through on-screen text.I found the acting in the movie to be quite commendable. While there are certainly areas that could benefit from some enhancements, overall, it was an enjoyable experience. As an autistic individual, I was pleased to see that subtitles were available for the film. However, I felt a bit disappointed that translations were not provided for dialogue spoken in other languages all of the time.The film's cinematography was impressive, utilizing a variety of shot types to enhance storytelling. Wide shots effectively conveyed the scale of events and provided context for the action. Close-ups captured characters' emotions, while medium shots balanced interaction with background elements, offering a comprehensive view of character dynamics. Over-the-shoulder shots fostered intimacy during conversations, engaging viewers in the dialogue. Tracking shots added fluidity to movements, intensifying excitement in chase scenes and battles. Finally, bird's-eye view shots delivered a dramatic perspective during high-action sequences, such as Iron Man's aerial maneuvers. Point-of-view (POV) shots immerse viewers in Tony Stark's experiences, especially when he interacts with his suit or technology like JARVIS. Slow motion enhances key action moments, allowing audiences to absorb critical details during fight sequences and major reveals. Establishing shots effectively introduce new locations and transitions, guiding viewers through the narrative. Cutaway shots enrich storytelling by showcasing reactions to main events, while dim lighting strategically highlights essential elements within the frame.I feel that the movie excels in crafting visually breath-taking sequences, especially during action-packed moments featuring Iron Man's suit and his confrontations with various villains. The technology employed to bring Iron Man's suit to life was considered cutting-edge for its era. However, I believe that ""Iron Man 2"" relied somewhat excessively on digital effects, lacking a sufficient balance with practical elements. I found the depiction of gore in the movie to be well-executed and highly convincing. I found the soundtrack to be quite impressive; it complemented the movie's scenes beautifully and is definitely something I would consider purchasing on vinyl.-I appreciated the opportunity to reconnect with familiar characters and meet some new ones. I liked how this sequel delved deeper into Tony Stark's personal struggles. After viewing the first Iron Man movie, I felt that he had undergone significant growth by its conclusion, leading me to hope for a noticeable reduction in his ego in this follow-up. It was fascinating to observe these characters as they navigated their daily lives and faced their unique challenges while the villains pursued their own agendas elsewhere. This narrative choice may result in a storyline that feels less action-oriented, yet it sets this instalment apart from others in both commendable and less favourable ways.I appreciated that the film prominently featured strong female characters. Natalie's role stood out to me, not merely as a sidekick but as a powerful figure who competently holds her own against her male counterparts. The portrayal of Pepper Potts adds significant depth to the narrative, illustrating a strong and independent woman who both supports and challenges Stark. Although Pepper Potts was granted more agency compared to her character in the first film, I believe her role still aligns with some traditional tropes often seen in female characters within superhero films.-Similar to the first film, this one also features an additional scene during the credits that sets the stage for the next MCU movie, Thor. Personally, I found myself slightly preferring the original Iron Man film than this one.I rate each Movie I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it an 6.9 Remember this was what I thought about the film personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Not bad for a second film, lets hope the 3rd is as good as the 1st","This would have been great had Terrence Howard not asked for so much money and just done the part, Don C. is a good actor but if you want to maintain continuity than for the love of film making use the same actors, because the combo of Robert Downey Jr., Gwyneth Paltrow and the rest of the crew made a very strong foundation and that foundation got some holes shot in it when they brought back ""Roddy"" (Terrence Howard's original character) and replace him with a completely different actor!!! What the heck guys, you could have given him a different name/title/rank something, but making the same character and having him played by two different actors is just wrong. Also the part of ""Justin Hammer"" was a bit much, but I think that was the whole point so we can let that one slide. Mickey Rourke made a great addition and the special effects were top shelf, definitely a good movie, but what keeps it from being a great movie and out-doing the first is the continuity which was ruined by one simple actor not willing to play ball. Who knows maybe there were other factors in the mix, but I stand by the point that you shouldn't have two difference actor's play the same character. Nuff said.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A bit over the top, but still fun to watch","Jon Favreau's followup to his 2008 smash hit Iron Man, based on the Marvel Comics superhero. We reunite with Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) right where we left him. He has announced to the world that he is indeed the man inside the suit of armor, and the world has never been safer because of it. Tony has run into a bit of a snag when the government tries taking the suit from him because they see it as a weapon, while Tony calls it a ""shield"". Meanwhile other copycats are attempted but fail, making the Iron Man suit a one of a kind, and therefore not a global threat.Well, like any good superhero story, a villain surfaces. Ivan Vanko (known in the comic book world as Whiplash, played here by Mickey Rourke), a Russian engineer whose father worked with Tony's father Howard. Vanko is out for redemption for what the Stark family has done to his, so in true evil villain fashion, Vanko tries to take out Stark with his own weapon design, only with some minor modifications.Back home in the US, Tony is bombarded with requests for his suit by the military, including his friend Lt. Col. James Rhodes a.k.a. War Machine (Don Cheadle). Tony is also feeling some pressure to join the organization S.H.I.E.L.D., a group spearheaded by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) who is essentially creating a Justice League like group that in the comic book world includes Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, and Thor to name a few.The majority of the film focuses on Tony and what his legacy will be. Is the Iron Man a weapon or a shield for the country to get behind? Is it a hazard or a necessity? Tony must decide what is right for his company, his country, and himself. His faces congressional committees, the media, and terrorist threats. It's not an easy life for the man in the shiny suit.As far as sequels go this one is not bad. What I was hoping it would do that it failed to do was add something different to the franchise. The action in my opinion is worse. It's to forced and over the top, unlike the first film where the action meant something. He battled his way out of a cave of terrorists, he saved a village under attack, and he fought the man who tried to ruin his company and keep selling weapons to the rest of the world. Here he fights a swarm of robots, his friend, and a the main villain twice, the first of which is cool, the second being lame.I was pleased with the acting of Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer, one of Stark's competitors. Rockwell is building up an impressive body of work as of late (excluding Gentlemen Broncos) and this film is no exception. He is smarmy and gets under your skin. I was also pleased with Paltrow and Scarlett Johansson (plays Tony's assistant). Neither one annoyed me or took away from the main line of action.The real winner for me was the screenplay by Justin Theroux. Downey Jr. played his role perfectly and hit each line the way he should have. The only character who I thought lacked the most was Rourke's. I thought he was at a disadvantage to begin with because he spoke limited English and had a Russian accent. I wasn't a huge fan of him overall in the film. Not sure if it's the character or the actor. Either way, I could have done without him.What I am curious about is whether or not the Iron Man franchise will be done with. I am aware that The Avengers is in the works (the group of super hero mentioned earlier) so he will all but surely get a part in that. Whether or not he'll get a new movie by himself is up in the air for me. They need a really, really strong villain that has interesting abilities and can speak English.Overall a good movie. A little too much emphasis on product placement and neat gadgets, but a a good movie nonetheless. Those expecting a solid action packed thrill ride might be let down by the in between moments, but I think for the most part people can enjoy this film. No glaring flaws. Just a fun movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Highly entertaining superhero flick,"Released in 2010, ""Iron Man 2"" naturally continues where 2008's ""Iron Man"" left off. With the knowledge that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is also Iron Man being made public, he must contend with serious heart problems, Daddy issues, alcoholism, a competing rat (Sam Rockwell), a mysterious new employee (Scarlett Johansson), a personal assistant who is now CEO and who also loves him (Gwyneth Paltrow), a friend who becomes a War Machine (Don Cheadle), Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. (Samuel L. Jackson) and a vengeful Russian with ties to his father's legacy (Mickey Rourke).I like this sequel better than the popular original because I generally don't like ""origin stories,"" as far as superhero movies go. More than that, ""Iron Man 2"" brims with confidence and is just full of kinetic entertainment from beginning to end, highlighted by a rockin' soundtrack and some curvy cuties, most notably Scarlett as The Black Widow (the character's film debut). On top of this, the writers add some meatier elements to the table, like Tony's father/son issues and his sad struggle with alcoholism (which comes straight from the 80's comics, the first superhero to be depicted with this problem).The film runs 124 minutes and was shot in the Greater Los Angeles area of Southern California, Monte Carlo, Monaco, and New York City.GRADE: A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not really worth it,"I watched Iron Man 2 earlier today and I found it quite boring and annoying. I am not a big fan of Robert Downey Jr. but I liked the original Iron Man. Personally I found this film boring because of the lack of action and the amount of talking. Also another mistake of the movie was letting Don Cheadle replace Terrence Howard. Cheadle and Downey Jr. did not have the same great chemistry like Howard and Downey Jr. And Iron Man's character is very weird in this. For example their a scene where's he's at a party in his suit. That was very awkward to watch.The story is also very predictable and well not that great. While watching I was also very confused throughout the movie. I liked the villain he was cool enough but other characters were annoying like Scarlett Johanson and that other girl. Iron Man (2008) was great because they didn't overreact with the story, I just didn't really like this movie. Granted it had some good moments but not enough for me",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
I like Robert Downey's faith,"I like Robert Downey's faith in Christ. It's the only reason I watch his films. Having said that, remember when Michael Bay tried to accomplish something epic with Transformers 2 with all these new characters and stuff? Well, Jon Faverau has managed to accomplish what Michael Bay never did- make a near-perfect sequel that manages to be just as great as the first. Now like the first, there's not a ton of action, but those scenes where action is absent, Faverau manages to make the most out of them. Complete with great action, laughs and characters, Iron Man 2 is the first big summer movie, and a must see on the big screen for sure, especially if you see it in digital! Iron Man 2 picks up half a year from when the first movie left off. The Stark Expo has just begun in Flushing, New York, and is to last all year. Tony, in a televised hearing, privatizes world peace. Life seems to be great, except for the fact that the reactor keeping him alive is killing him. This doesn't stop him from being Iron Man though- he continues to go on as Iron Man for the moment. He even considers replacing Pepper Potts with Natalie Rushman, appointing Potts a CEO to Stark Industries. However, in Russia, Ivan Vanko, the son of physicist Anton Vanko, having just lost his father and jealous of Stark's success, creates his own arc reactor, and becomes Whiplash, a badass villain with two electrified whips that can split anything in half with enough force.His first appearance is at a race in Monaco, and after a brief (and failed) attempt to kill Tony, he meets up with Justin Hammer, Stark's rival, and they both collaborate to build a new technology that will hopefully overthrow Tony. However, with a stint at Tony's house appointing James Rhodes as War Machine, and several other plots, Tony Stark, suffering through personal problems, doesn't know if he really can be Iron Man and resolve all this.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Low 7/10,People may say this movie is a waste of time and doesn't add anything that much to the story of Tony Stark. But the charm of Iron Man 2 is the realism of an icon-turned hero. The portrayal of Tony in this movie feels relatable. Iron Man 2 is the most indie-Esque movie in the MCU. Cause the focus isn't really on the plot but on Tony Stark's reaction to the story. It's like the price of fame and the lack of balance between being Tony and Iron Man. The best way to watch this movie is to be laid back until the 3rd act of the film. It's an odd movie and feels so out of place. But unique at the same time.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My Least Favorite MCU Movie,"I know this isn't at the bottom of most people's MCU list rankings, but it easily at the bottom of mine. I don't even think the movie is that bad, but watching this movie immediately after the first makes this movie look like a dumpster fire. They just tried to do what the first movie did but with everything dialed up to ten. More action, more cheesy one-liners, and more characters. That doesn't sound that bad but they just didn't pull it off. All in all, this is the most disappointing sequel in this entire universe and my least favorite movie in the MCU.6.6/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Iron movie,"IM2 is a good movie on it's own merit. The movie is based on a comic and you should therefore not expect too much of this movie. It's a fun action movie. What works for this movie is the witty dialogue, spectacular visuals and the overall fun feel of the movie. What one might say doesn't work for this movie is the pretty formulaic story, the forgettable characters (with the exception of a few) and a plot that can be ripped to pieces under scrutiny. So would you like this movie? Yes, if you're not critical and are just looking for an entertaining movie that doesn't take itself serious. Also the violence in this movie isn't extreme (with the exception of a few scenes) so kids can watch this movie under the guidance of their parents. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"If you enjoyed Iron Man,you'll enjoy this entertaining sequel.","Iron Man returns in this action packed and for the most part hugely entertaining sequel.Downey JNR is once again on good form as Tony Stark and there are fun new inclusions to the cast list including Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke.Rockwell very nearly steals the film from under Downey Jnrs nose delivering a highly enjoyable performance as a kind of Tony Stark wannabe.Mickey Rourke plays a Russian baddie but the director does a good job with his actors and never allows Rourke to become panto or over emphasised,he's just a brooding menace. The film does have it's shortcomings though.Like the first film,it does go all Transformers towards the end and it doesn't take long for CGI to bore but the chemistry of the cast and the fun being had does go a long way to paper over those particular cracks. Scarlet Johansson is introduced for no other reason than she looks great in a tight leather outfit. Gwyneth Paltrow also turns up without offering much more. Don Cheadle replaced Terrence Howard as Col Rhodes which is a shame for the continuity but on the whole the film fizzes with fun and thus delivers the very thing its target audience pay for.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"""Iron Man 2"" could be critically bashed a hundred times over.  So just have fun with it instead.","""Iron Man 2"" was a good sequel. I am only so simple with words because that is all it was frankly. Now before I sound like an unsatisfied little boy, I thought the movie was very entertaining, therefore it did it's job well. I hate comparing sequels to their predecessors, but the reality is that nowadays or just ""right now"", when it comes to a series the ""bar"" must continue to be raised higher and higher and higher. I can guarantee myself that this is a very rare thing; for the ""bar"" to continue to grow higher. I will not compare ""Iron Man 2"" to any other film because all films are different and that is just unfair. But anyways back to business. As I sat beside my easily-impressed, overall fun friend in the theatre, much yearning to take a washroom break (perhaps this affected my perception of the film), I was wishing I could just have a fun time like him as he laughed his head off at all these comedic scenes. But me being me, I found it hard to ignore the questions running through my mind. It was impossible for me to push away the feeling that the mood in ""Iron Man 2"" was continually changing. As in, every 30 seconds. During scenes that seemed to be giving off a rather serious mood, I remember thinking the film right there was trying to make me feel concerned for so and so. But then the feeling instantly vanished as if I was supposed to forget about it and laugh. This happened quite a number of times.I won't bother debate about the ""realness"" of ""Iron Man 2"". I would only say the visual effects were incredible and among the best around right now. I'm sure an incredible amount of time, effort and money were put into that. The only troubling thing was that the huge amount of CGI took away much of the ""human"" feeling in the movie. That is, the film element that very much helps me connect with the characters. This is the same problem that I had with ""Transformers 2"". But then again, this isn't a review on that movie at all. So I'll kick myself now and move on.In this movie Robert Downey Jr. gave a solid performance just as he does in the first film. Some other characters however were more ""invisible"". What I am trying to say by that is many of the characters with smaller roles had no depth. They seemed to be there for the sake of having another joke in the film. Then again, maybe I'm just boring.Anyways, it is not my intention at all to make you turn away from watching this film. I just figured perhaps if you are reading this after going on ""IMDB"" you are someone looking for something more critical than ""It was a good movie."", which you'll find almost everywhere else on the internet. I hate communicating like this because you could get the very wrong impression that I did not like ""Iron Man 2"". I really, really liked it.So the bottom line is: If you are like my awesome friend: go right now and see this movie. If you are like me: go right now and see this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fun joyride,"In the sequel to IRON MAN and prequel to THE INCREDIBLE HULK, we follow Tony Stark facing court due to the usage of Stark company weapons, and at the same time fight the film's two villains, Whiplash (Mickey Rourke) and Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell). The film also introduces Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to the MCU, who has the best fight scene in the whole movie.To be honest, this film is more forgettable than THE INCREDIBLE HULK. IRON MAN 2 lacks so much of the charm and fun that made the first film great, and tries really hard to capture that same magic, but to me the first IRON MAN film just feels like a lightning in a bottle, and the kind of story it tells and the WAY it tells, and plays off is so much more grounded and compelling than the sequel. For a lot of its runtime it feels IRON MAN 2 is drifting off from character to character that are building up to the climax, but I don't know if I missed something or not, because I never felt like the movie was actually building to anything.On to the things I approve of in the movie, Johansson is a fantastic addition, and though she doesn't do A LOT in the movie, her fight scene near the end is kickass, and as for Robert Downey Jr., he is great as usual, but to me the stand outs of the film are Rourke and Rockwell. Rourke is pretty menacing in the role, and Rockwell is a comedic, Saul Goodman-type character, and a joy to watch.Despite not having a very compelling plot, IRON MAN 2 is still a fun joyride that is elevated by good performances, and a badass main character.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Every Bit as Good as the First Movie,"At the end of the first movie ""Tony Stark"" (Robert Downey Jr.) admits to the world that he is Iron Man. This sequel picks up where the last movie left off with a few major developments. First, a Russian physicist by the name of ""Ivan Vanko"" (Mickey Rourke) sets out to avenge his father's supposed betrayal by Stark Enterprises by killing--Tony Stark. Additionally, Tony Stark's main rival in defense armaments named ""Justin Hammer"" (Sam Rockwell) wants to acquire Tony Stark's technology by any means necessary in order to corner the market on Tony's invention. And if these two problems weren't bad enough there is also another problem Tony has to deal with-he is slowly dying. Anyway, rather than disclose the entire plot and risk ruining the film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that I thought this sequel was every bit as good as the first movie. Naturally, there is plenty of action and CGI but like the original movie it also brings back the humor and the same attractive actresses in Gwyneth Paltrow (as ""Pepper Potts"") and Leslie Bibb (""Christine Everhart""). Along with that, Scarlett Johansson (""Natalie Rushman"") also graces the screen. Likewise, both Robert Downey Jr. and Mickey Rourke put in fine performances as well.

A satisfying sequel in MCU's baby steps,"Continuing my journey with my first born to the world of the MCU and getting to remember why it became so good almost two decades ago. Maybe if was getting judged these days, it probably didn't get so much love, but when judging it back in those days and maybe also in a retrospective look - it passes both tests successfully.Tony Stark went out of the shadows and got the recognition as Iron Man, but now the potential enemies starts to grow within and from the outside. Evil force of a Russian scientist is getting real and activated with the inspiration of Iron's Man suit invention.At the same time the judgment system is trying to regulate the potential rough Man of Iron and stick a mirror to his face, for him to understand he needs to share the information about his weapon to a proper institute, for research purpose and what not.Tony and Pepper are getting spicy and we got Tony's recognition that he might not survive, due to his increasing power and the fact that this suit is sucking his life force. Sounds a lot, doesn't it? Well...it is. Several subjects for at least two movies get squeezed into one and though it is a lot of fun, and the action sequences are pretty polished, it is sometimes too much.The chemistry between Robert Downey Jr. And Gwyneth Paltrow is of the chart. You can add his chemistry also with Don Cheadle and you get multiple collaborations, that made this movie fun to watch. Mickey Rourke is not bad as a villain, but is not being used enough.

"Great atmosphere, far too many themes","""Iron Man 2"" is not the perfect sequel to his predecessor, which was surprising and exciting.

But whilst I didn't love it like the first movie, I did find it somewhat enjoyable this time around.This one is a bit more concerned with setting things up for Avengers than the previous movies, I recall Jon Favreau had a lot of problems with the Marvel higher-ups, due to their constant interference, to the point that they were having him rewrite the script as the film was still shooting. In particular, elements such as the S.H.I.E.L.D. subplot, were the result of a need to establish the greater Marvel Cinematic Universe in preparation for Avengers, at the expense of the coherence of this film's own plot. I remember Rourke being upset his character lost a lot of screentime and character development as a result.Downer Jr is again great as Tony Stark, Rourke hams it up well and is an intimidating villain!! I surprisingly did not take to Don Cheadle as Major Rhodes, which is strange as I like him as an actor!Garry Shandling, on the other hand, is an actor I hate.

While the storyline is intriguing, it is unfortunately overshadowed by the abundance of special effects and action sequences, leaving little room for character development or emotional depth.Robert Downey Jr. Once again delivers a stellar performance as Tony Stark, bringing his signature wit and charm to the role. However, the other characters in the movie fall short in comparison. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff (aka Black Widow) is underutilized, and Mickey Rourke as the villain Ivan Vanko lacks the charisma and complexity of other Marvel villains.The direction and production design are well-done, as to be expected from a Marvel movie. The special effects are impressive, especially in the action scenes, but at times feel like they are taking center stage over the actual plot.The pace of the movie is fast and exciting, but also feels rushed at times. The dialog is filled with quips and one-liners, but lacks the depth and substance that could have made it truly memorable.Overall, Iron Man 2 is a fun and enjoyable movie that fans of the Marvel franchise will likely appreciate. However, it falls short in delivering a truly exceptional movie-going experience. While it has its moments of excitement and humor, it ultimately feels average and forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The MCU stumbles in its (kind of) sophomore outing, that while not without its good points does feel overstuffed and unfocused","6 months after revealing to the world he is the superhero dubbed by the public as ""Iron Man"", Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) embraces the fame and attention the role has brought him as he opens the Stark Expo showcasing technological advancements from across the globe. Handing off most of the business affairs of Stark Industries to his assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) whom he names CEO, Tony finds himself under intense pressure from a senate subcommittee chaired by Senator Stern (Garry Shandling) to turn over the Iron Man armor with rival weapons manufacture and government contractor Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) all too eager to get his hands on the armor to reverse engineer it. Additionally, Tony is also facing possible death as the arc reactor keeping his heart alive is slowly poisoning him leading to brash and impulsive decisions. The new attention on Tony soon brings Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) after Tony who carries a grudge against Tony's family.After the success of Iron Man, Marvel Studios announced their intent to produce a sequel. Despite the success of Iron Man the movie went through length rounds of negotiations including the return of director Jon Favreau and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury who despite appearing in the post-credit of Iron Man had a contractual dispute with Marvel that almost lead to him abandoning the role only to be brought back with a nine film contract. The film was the first MCU property to be released following Marvel's acquisition by Disney and with the confirmation from 2008's The Incredible Hulk Tony Stark cameo establishing the shared universe intent there was naturally considerable hype built around this follow-up. Made for $200 million, Iron Man 2 only grossed slightly more than its predecessor at $620 million, and while the movie received some praise from critics and audiences it was seen as a weaker installment in comparison to the first one with many feeling the film felt overly busy and cluttered with too many pieces. Iron Man 2 is a fun movie in bursts, but it's undeniably an overstuffed movie that isn't as well balanced as it should be.As you've probably gathered from my plot synopsis in the first paragraph, there is a lot that goes on in this movie even when we don't account for the Avengers initiative setup that takes up a considerable amount more screentime than the teaser at the end of the first movie. With Tony facing multiple crises both personal and professional, having not one but two antagonists out for him, and introducing or expanding on several other characters, Iron Man 2 gave me a similar feeling to Spider-Man 3 where there's good elements at play but they're not given room to breath and often feel like they're crowding each other out. Don Cheadle in particular is really good stepping in for Terrence Howard in the role of Rhody, but it's only really in the third act he gets to make an impression with most of the prior scenes not really allowing him to do all that much. We also have elements that are seemingly brought out of nowhere with a plot point about Tony Stark's animosity towards his father given barely any development that makes the payoff feel inconsequential as a result.I will say that Robert Downey Jr. Is still good playing Tony Stark, but it does feel like he is going through a similar arc to what he went through in the first movie. The fact that Tony is facing his own mortality is supposed to be a driving factor behind why Tony is engaging in selfish self-destructive behavior, but for much of the running time Iron Man 2 feels very uncritical about Tony's behavior despite the intention being to paint it as a bad thing, but the fact you often seen many emulating Tony's behavior and often celebrating it as something to aspire to makes it feel massively misjudged in its handling on that point. The movie also has even less interesting villains this time around with both Justin Hammer and Ivan Vanko not particularly interesting or memorable as antagonists.Iron Man 2 isn't an MCU movie I revisit very often. While there are things that do genuinely work, they often feel suffocated by how much bloat is in the movie with not enough time dedicated to any particular thread to make you care to the point you did in the first one. Iron Man 2 feels like a ""Bridge episode"" from a serial TV series in that it just exists to setup obligatory plot points for things the writers want to do rather than anything in it being a motivating factor in itself.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
My God that cast!,"""I never understood the problem with this movie. I honestly don't get it.The story is quite all over the place (you have Tony Stark relationship with Pepper Potts, Tony Stark fight for his life, Avengers touches with Fury and Coulson and Black Widow, Tony fighting with Justin Hammer at a business level, Ivan Vanko going for revenge on a personal level... Lol. That's a freaking lot and I didn't include Tony's father and alcohol issues. Oh, and War Machine's origin).So yeah. I get it. To some, it's too much. But I absolutely love almost every single scene from this movie. I don't care. I just love every story beat, even if it's not artistically well developed.Sadly, again, """"Iron Man"""" doesn't know how to end a movie. We got some dumb villains doing dumb things for some reason, and there is no tension really, and it gets too big in concept but the budget just doesn't allow for it to translate well enough onscreen, and it kind of sucks. Oh well. I still love this one.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
It's decent entertainment but also a bit of a lazy sequel,"I absolutely loved the first Iron Man. It looked silly in the previews, but it turned out to an almost perfect mix of comedy, action and story/character development. With great anticipation I awaited this second installment..only to be mildly disappointed.Iron Man 2 doesn't stray too far from the successful formula of its predecessor, but for some reason it doesn't really add up.At least I am sure that the action is not to blame; there is a lot more of it this time around, and for the most part it is spectacular.There is still plenty of humor around as well, but Iron Man 2's track record isn't flawless here. While most of the jokes are pretty good, a significant portion does fall flat. Robert Downey still does a brilliant job, but Sam Rockwell's character, while well-acted, is annoying in a very non-funny way.But the biggest problem this time around is that all the jokes and the action don't really add up til a memorable tale. You never really get the idea that there is much at stake or that the narrative is going anywhere. The plot jumps through all the familiar hoops but nothing is really fleshed out. As a case in point, Mickey Rourke is totally wasted as the bad guy.Also, I am getting really tired of the phenomenon that a movie seems to exist solely as a commercial for the next installment in the series....half of the running time of Iron Man seems to be a commercial for the upcoming Avengers movie.Iron Man 2 offers enough action and jokes to provide two hours of fairly solid entertainment..but unlike the first part, it's not more than the sum of its parts. Not all of the humor works, and in terms of characters and story it feels lazy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
More Iron Man!,"After the spectacular first one, I was definitely looking forward to Iron Man 2! Robert Downey, Jr. was so good as Tony Stark, he brought Iron Man into my top list of favorite super heroes! I was very glad to hear he was back for the sequel. He doesn't disappoint! Tony is as arrogant and hilarious as ever while still kicking butt as Iron Man. Though, this time around, he's having some issues- the arc reactor in his chest is poisoning him, he's having daddy issues, there's a new villain 'Whiplash' (a great Mickey Rourke), a competitive weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer (played wonderfully by Sam Rockwell), the government wants his suit. So much to deal with but I enjoy watching Tony deal with all of it. We also get to learn more about his father, Howard Stark. Legacy is very important in this movie.The acting is great all around, with Robert, Sam, Mickey all having fun. Gwenyth Paltrow is beautiful as ever though her role here mostly consists of being stressed out over running Stark's company. Don Cheadle takes over for Terrence Howard as Rhodes and he does a pretty good job. I only really started to like him towards the end where I felt the most that he was Tony's best friend. Scarlett kicks some serious butt here but I thought her performance was only alright. If only the script gave her more to work with.There are some sweet action sequences like the Monaco race/Whiplash attack and Iron Man vs. War Machine/Drones/Whiplash climax. Watching Scarlett take on all those guards was a treat! So was seeing Sam Jackson as Nick Fury. Iron Man and War Machine fighting side by side? EPIC! Negatives? Maybe too much talking, the middle portion is a bit slow, Rhodes wasn't all that likable until the end, the fight between Iron Man/War Machine and Whiplash was too brief, Whiplash felt a bit too one-dimensional which was sad when you think of how the character could have been without all the editing.Still, Iron Man 2 is a fun sequel with a ton of humor, great lines, interesting story, heart, action, and fun performances.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Cheadle's more competent than Downey's.,"Director Jon Favreau expands on the success of the first film. The dialogue crackles, the special effects pop, and the action onscreen never slows down. During the next hour or so, though, everything all begins to break apart slowly and imperceptibly. Downey, Rockwell, and Rourke are all having a great time, but Don Cheadle's role as Stark's redundant buddy-cum-sidekick Rhodes is redundant. 'Iron Man 2' is gleaming, endearing, and never dull.However, it's wildly unequal and overly complicated. The film leaves the audience feeling unfulfilled and yearning for more. Let's hope the series' potential is realized in the planned third installment.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Boosted By Strong Performances, Special/ Practical Effects, Costume Design As Usual With Marvel Movies, But Let Down By A Weak Plot","Pros:
1. The costume design for both Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and War Machine (Don Cheadle) is amazing, and the Iron Man suit in particular looks far better than it did in the first film.
2. The score and soundtrack are lively and action-packed, especially with the call-back to AC/DC.
3. The special and practical effects still look fantastic 10 years later.
4. Robert Downey Jr. and Sam Rockwell (Justin Hammer) give brilliant performances.
5. The action scenes are captivating and really entertaining to watch.
6. The comedy is placed appropriately and it always procures laughs.
7. Gwyneth Paltrow (Pepper Potts) and Robert Downey Jr. have great chemistry together and it really shows in their character interactions.Cons:
1. The co-plots of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) struggling with his new heart device, and Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) seeking revenge for his father's exclusion from Stark Industries, seem like they were hastily cobbled together for some semblance of a story.
2. Somehow Lt. Col. James 'Rhodey' Rhodes (Don Cheadle) is able to utilise (which includes flying) a iron suit relatively well as soon as he steps into it, even though it took Tony Stark multiple attempts in the first movie to master it.
3. The end boss fight between Iron Man, War Machine and Ivan Vanko is really anti-climactic as Ivan Vanko is finished off ridiculously quickly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Grab your popcorn and get ready for the ride,Just came back from Iron Man 2 and it is a movie to be enjoyed. One feels like a young child watching this movie as it plays out like a comic book in front of the viewer. The pace and action of the movie are terrific. Robert Downey Jr.'s acting and presence in the movie carries it with charm and charisma and you like the Tony Starke character who unlike other comic book hero alter egos actually is not nebbish. Gwyneth Paltrow is good in this movie though she is more wallpaper in many of the scenes and the Sam Rockwell character was just a joy to watch. Mickey Rourke rocks in his role as he eats scenery with panache and yet his acting is so natural. If I had any problem with this movie was the presence of Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johanssen they were just draining on the movie. Jackson again plays the same character he has been playing for it seems the last 15-20 years and basically puts me off any movie he appears in while Scarlett may be easy to look at but what is the big deal about her acting she is listless and incredibly charisma free. The director Jon Favreau is superb and his acting is fun and basically grab your popcorn and get ready for the ride and with AC/DC music what else can one ask for. My rating 9 but the Jackson/Johannsen presence you lose 2 for a 7,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as the first but still good anyway,"This movie is entertaining, funny, all that good stuff, I don't know why, but there has always been something that just do not like about this film, the emotion I guess is kinda missing but it's alright, it's good but not great.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Unbalanced: too much talking, and not enough tension, action, or excitement","Instead of being called ""Iron Man 2,"" the title of this film should read, ""Iron Man's Day Off"" because we spend so little time with Iron Man and more time with endless scenes of boring conversation and arguing. When you actually find yourself genuinely annoyed at fictional characters for, frankly, just talking too much, it's a clear sign of a film with flaws. Remember that feeling when you've just begun your 40 minute commute to work, and the radio-show you're listening to is about to do an interesting bit? Instead, 40 minutes later, the over-talkative DJ is still stuck on the same silly rant from the beginning of your commute and because of a 9 o'clock meeting you never get to hear the bit. This is Iron Man 2 the longer it played out. Example - Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) and Warhammer (Don Cheadle) are planning for the final showdown we've been waiting for at the film's climax. In my head, this scene still has not ended: ""You stand there, because if I stand there I (insert sarcastic comment). Okay, deal!"" Great, now we're finally getting down to business, as both characters then go off for battle. But one of them stops. ""Wait, I don't like this, what if you..."" as they suddenly walk back to argue some more. Well by this point in the film, only a lobotomy-patient would not want to yell ""Just go fight the bleeding robots! Stop proving to the audience how funny and sarcastic you are and go do something cool! We've been waiting 90 boring minutes since the racetrack battle for something else remotely exciting to happen!""The first 20-30 minutes of IM2 are easily the best as the introduction of Ivan Vanko character, played effortlessly by Mickey Rourke, sets up what you think will be an interesting story. The opening action at the racetrack was well-executed, exciting, and is the highlight of the film. This is also the point where the film lost its steam. The next 90 minutes is constant chatter – most of it uninteresting - and moments of interaction that almost over-emphasize the quirkiness of the characters as opposed to providing any real tension. These quirks and imperfections to the characters were positive qualities of the first film but are overdone here. Apart from the story, the character interactions by themselves are well written and very funny at times. But at @ 1:15 into the film I remember thinking, enough of the humor, enough of the tedium, when is something of tension, interest, or action going to happen? More of these boring scenes serve no other purpose than linking themselves to a 10-second gag in the film's final moments. By the time the grand finale arrives, you feel like you've just walked out of a tax seminar and really don't care to see any action because you just want to sleep. If you are still awake by the time the action arrives you'll get something that falls far short of any reward for surviving 90 minutes of sheer boredom. The finale is a 5 minute fight with the drones as the Iron Men return fire while flying through the air, which was nothing too innovative or blow-you-away exciting. The only great moment following the flying-around involved Rourke's character making a final appearance, but it is over in almost 30 seconds. And when I say ""30 seconds"" I don't mean it as hyperbole, it really is this short.Ivan Vanko repeats the words ""drone better!"" during the middle of the film. The filmmakers must have said the same, in favoring a story which drones on and on like a robot with little humanity inside – despite a semi-moving back-story involving Stark's father (played straightforwardly by Mad Men's John Slattery). Still, pacing is what killed this film. This is an Iron Man film but we get so few moments of him in action, or anything in the way of excitement. The action in the first film felt far more personal and well-conceived. I do though place strong exception on the racetrack scene – the golden egg of the sequel. Still, the rest of the constant conversation in IM2 wasn't interesting enough to be enjoyable, and because of this you'll just want to see action if you aren't asleep yet. This is the clearest symptom of story and pacing issues.I'll also mention that Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) was a hard character to read - was he a villain, or was he just a feeble and tragic figure? I never quite knew what to feel for him. I kept waiting for him to shed the sideshow act and show a genuine and serious tone with serious resolve, but this never happens and ultimately he goes out with a whimper instead of a bang. The other addition, Scarlett Johansen's Black Widow, provided great eye-candy but her character really wasn't given much to do in the film's 2 hours.Overall this is a comedy/drama film with a couple stops for action - which to me translates for an incredibly uneven film for this genre, especially for something as potentially through-the-roof entertaining as Iron Man can be! Talking doesn't necessarily mean boring, but the story wasn't nearly gripping enough for the constant yapping to be an interesting listen. Of all the stories which could have been told, this was the best they had for us? By itself this film is not a bad one, but compared to the first it was a disappointment. The name of the game was ""unbalanced."" The lack of tension and panache to the story (after the 30 minute mark) made the action feel like an afterthought when it finally arrived, and made even the humor feel as tedious as a trip to the DMV.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Underwhelming Sequel,"Iron man 2 brings back the hero to stop a new threat, while also introducing Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson)Unlike the first film, Iron Man 2 lacks the likeable humor and exciting action sequences.
It felt boring and uninteresting.
The cast should have been great! Rockwell and Rourke were excellent choices for the films villains. But, just as Marvel is known for, they leave their villains underdone and forgettable.
Scarlett Johansson also leaves you wanting a much better actress for Black Widow.I do still enjoy Iron Man 2 an entry in the MCU, but it was definitely disappointing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Fun & Entertaining,"This movie was very good. Robert Downey Jr. brings a lot of fun and humor to this film as he did previously to the first film. Lots of great action and fun CGI with entertaining performances from Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Scarlett Johanson, Samuel L. Jackson, and Sam Rockwell. Mickey Rourke is perfectly cast as the super villain and looks totally BAD A**. The movie is fun to see with friends with a few thrills and laughs and hot supporting actresses. It is not an epic or a great film but is lots of fun. The first Iron Man is a better movie but this might be a bit more fun. This film introduces SHIELD and a ton more new characters to look forward to in the coming films. I liked the film and I think you will too.

A decent damn good action superhero sequel MCU my favorite,"I love the first Iron Man I like Iron Man 2 It is a big step down from the first movie, seen it for the first time I try to understand the movie what they try to do with this film. The acting, the tone everything in this movie fall flat, but it is decent at least is not boring or stupid like Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) that movie sucks so much!!! It is a damn good action MCU movie I am taking ""Iron Man 2"" over the new MARVEL films anytime . It is part of my life so Iron Man 2 is a decent okay action film at best. They are worst MARVEL films I totally hate than the second entry in ""Iron Man"" trilogy. Iron Man 2 I will still watch it. Iron Man 2 is good/bad mixed film and an okay at best.The action sequences are good specially the fights on a race track with Whiplash and Iron Man I like that. Samuel L. Jackson is perfect as Nick Fury I wish his character would have more much to do, but the screen writer did not let his character more to do except giving Tony Stark advices. I liked that Tony Stark tried to fix the things he broke it and he tried to make sure with the new element that he structured in his arc reactor and ends his palladium so that he want die. Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman / Natasha Romanoff was her first gig and she was okay I liked her. But acrobatic stunts Johansson's stuntwoman for the fights in which Black Widow fights off Hammer's bodyguards were all fake and not realistic.AC/DC return for this film with three soundtracks: Thunderstruck, Shoot to Thrill and Highway to Hell I like those songs for the movie. So yes AC/DC is one of the reasons why I don't consider Iron Man 2 as the worst MCU movie ever. Listen to this soundtracks and you will enjoy your self. The opening scene in which Iron Man jumps off the plane and you hear that song I like very much. I mean Robert Downey Jr. didn't do a terrible performance as Tony Stark/Iron Man but his character in this movie was a disaster. Paul Bettany's voice as JARVIS is till good and like able to the film.The rest of the film is a completely disaster they make Iron Man in to total joke in this movie. Jon Favreau ruined the movie what was he thinking? And he got crap for Iron Man Three while in that movie he was decent in here he wasn't. Iron Man 2 is MILES much way better film than Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018) I will never watch that movie again!!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Fast paced,"As with part 1, ""Iron Man 2"" delivers a fast paced kick of action and adrenalin.There is a good story to part 2 and it doesn't have a dull moment. There is action from the very beginning till the end.And of course, the cast is amazing, just as in part one. However, one thing that puzzled me was why they had Gary Shandling in this movie. He was so out of place here, and he looks like he is constantly constipated. But other that than, the cast did a marvelous job. Hats off for Mickey Rourke for his performance in particular.The movie is full of cool effects and lots of wonderful CGI. Truly a treat for the eye.Usually, I am not too keen on movies based on comic books, but the Iron Man movies are actually making it work.

corroded man,"I've always had and in fact always will have a sense of awe on the level of technology Hollywood manages to apply in creating motion pictures. The sequences, sets, artwork etc. look extremely genuine on screen that gives us a real time experience. Now, there is a popular sect of movies in Hollywood that boasts extravaganza in everything except a logical storyline and among them as one of the front runners is Iron Man 2. Directed by Jon Favreau, the director for the first venture of Iron Man series casts all the same actors in the previous roles and the new ones being Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle and Mickey Rourke in this sequel which boasts almost twice the quality of the visual effects produced by the first film. Tony Stark is back, this time as the most popular figure in the world because he is the IRON MAN. After the dramatic revealing of his secret identity, Tony Stark pledges to achieve universal peace. But all superheroes cannot carry out their 'good job' so easily; there are always obstacles in the form of villains. So does iron man, who faces hostility in every clichéd way possible. Very much like Spiderman 3 , Iron man 2 fails to impress due to two reasons. Robert Downey Jr plays very redundantly throughout without experimenting and Gwyneth Paltrow plays her role like a zombie. I doubt whether Don Cheadle actually had any idea about his role in the movie because he moves back and forth with the nature of his character. Scarlett Johansson looks stunning but again lacks a well defined role. The only relief in terms of acting was Mickey Rourke who did justice to his role though not given much screen space. So in first case the lack of character definition provided the major flaw to the movie. If the actors had done a good job, I wouldn't have cared much about the complex storyline. For one thing, the sequences are so startling that one thing struck me immediately; the filmmakers have lost all respect for the world. So here, the second factor too comes to effect where the director has complicated the theme with less of logic and more of mindless destruction and in a way terrorism too. So if you are ready for a thrilling and chilling ride with lot of explosions, firing and iron man vs. iron man and if you think the story accounts to nothing, then iron man 2 is the one for you.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"See if you have to with the friends, but otherwise, much better films available! =)","A man made of Iron!? Are they MAD!? Frankly, I would have just used a giant magnet to beat him in the first instalment. But alas! They didn't listen, now Downey is suited up in CGI again to return in this sequel. At first look at the opening of the film, seeing Ivan Vanko, aka Whiplash (Rourke), give an unconvincing, whimpering shout as his dad peacefully dies; immediately, 'don't laugh, it's supposed to be serious' is the first thought that crosses the mind. But then away from that hideous piece of acting, and after the long, long, ever so long title sequence, the film really starts to begin. The plot isn't a surprising one, as Vanko coincidentally is a super villain physicist (that old chestnut) who knows how to create the palladium energy source and tries to sell it to Hammer (Rockwell). Meanwhile, Stark has some trouble's of his own, and has to find a new element to stop the palladium's toxicity from killing him. Besides the fact he has an army of droids coming to kick his metal American ass. The narrative is relatively easy to follow and most people will understand it, except the one person with the east London accent who always says, ""I don't get it"" to any film that wasn't created by Disney. Downey does give another sublime, cheeky performance, saying his cute one liners and woman-wooing ways that makes you giggle. Apart from his comedy; everything else is pretty much dark and serious which isn't always the best road to go down when making a film about a super hero, for example, Spider Man 3. Oh dear. But Favreau does manage to dodge the bullet with putting Downey and his light hearted ways on camera nearly all of the time. No pressure Robert! As for the rest of the cast, pretty average and almost shadowed behind the lead. The action sequences are much more complex in this film, which is more eye pornography than meaningful. As there is more talking and witty banter between characters in this film, the fighting scenes are neglected and only a few are shown, which makes you savour them, like it's the last Fruit Pastel in a tube. The special effects are typical of a tent pole movie; well constructed with a perfect shine to make you believe they're real which overall adds to quite an intense effect. If you really want the full experience of this film's fighting sequences, you have to see it at an IMAX. Overall, Iron Man 2 is a watchable sequel with a few moments that have to be seriously tweaked, but definitely worth the price of an admission ticket with the friends. Plus the soundtrack is awesome, AC/DC and SugarHill Gang in the same movie!? Count me in!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Can't ask for much more from a sequel.,"If you appreciated Jon Favreau's Iron Man, then you'll love IM2. There's not much new on show, but once had a taste of what Tony Stark has to offer, you'll know what to expect. Although Robert Downey Jr.'s character thrives as a philanthropist and making the world a better place, unrest broods in the background. Two villains occupy Stark's attention. The maniacal Ivan Vanko (Rourke), who disproves Stark's theory that every country in the world is far behind his technology, and Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), the CEO of a competing weapons/defence manufacturer. The one that sways heads is Scarlet Johansson, the Marvel Universe's much needed heroine (sorry Pepper).Ultimately IM2 is only as strong as its hero, so pretty damn strong then. Having less superhero smash-ups and more human character development is attractive to comic- book fans and movie lovers.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

"I'd love to leave my door unlocked at night, but this ain't Canada.","It was very entertaining, but...I can understand how the realization that you are dying can make everything seem pointless, but it really makes for a depressing start to a movie that is supposed to be an action adventure. Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) was really a pain to watch while he whined and made an a** of himself.Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) was reduced to be a complaining CEO as Tony fell apart. It was not a joy to watch.Now, Don Cheadle was great. Scarlett Johansson was hot and kicked butt. Mickey Rourke was perfect for the role of the bad guy.I will look forward to seeing most of these characters return in The Avengers, but I hope they lose the pity party and focus on action.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Downey was good,"There's something about Robert Downey Jr's sarcastic tone and out there charisma that suits this character (no pun intended). Mickey Rourke & Sam Rockwell are now villains Ivan & Justin, two competitors of Tony Stark (Downey, JR). Don Cheadle plays James Rhodes, AKA Warhead, Scarlett Johansson plays Natalie, Samuel L. Jackson plays Nick Fury, Jon Favreau plays Happy, Paul Bettany plays Jarvis, Leslie Bibb plays Christine, and Garry Shandling plays Senator Stern. Guess what? They're all excellent. Shandling, especially, who has some of the funniest lines I have seen thus far this year. Rockwell has one of the funniest opening scenes in the film. There's so much to like about Iron Man 2, that, although not flawless, you forget its flaws, and just enjoy the spectacular ride you are to have.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"Another Sequel, Another Day","When you enjoy the novelty of a film so much, the sequel can be a hard sell---because where do you find more novelty? You can introduce more characters, like Scarlett Johansson as Natalie Rushman aka you know who. You can try making things bigger and badder, but that in itself is not novel. No, it is best to devise a new story line that comes out of nowhere and sets the viewer on his keister. Surprise plus great acting can win the day.But ""Iron Man 2"" mostly employs the more-of-the-same strategy and disappoints. Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is not so heroic and he doesn't go through a traditionally heroic story arc. Screens full of explosions and high-test action only entertain so much. One of its best scenes comes early, when Stark drives in the Monaco Grand Prix.Another entertaining scene is when Stark testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee and is grilled by Senator Stern , played by Garry Shandling. It has something to say about senatorial showmanship, government overreach, and the smarmy types who are elected far too many times. And Stark stands his ground, even if he is a narcissistic sybarite.IM2 is one of many sequels that fall short, but one always hopes that the magic of the original can be amplified to take us to another special place, as with ""Terminator 2"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Doesn't compare to the original,"This film is disappointing after the first Iron Man film. I had very high expectations but it did not meet them.

I didn't mind watching this but I didn't enjoy it either.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
A sequel that is on par with its predecessor,"While not quite the pinnacle of its genre that some people make it out to be, the first Iron Man was a ton of fun. It was further proof that comic book movies could successfully be made for both fans and those unfamiliar with the source material. Iron Man 2, while not the surprise hit that the original was, is – for the most part – on par with its predecessor.First off, one of the primary complaints that I've heard from many people is that there is too much of a focus on S.H.I.E.L.D. members Nick Fury and Black Widow, and that their mere inclusion in the film only bog the movie down. To that, I wholeheartedly disagree. I found that there were enough hints throughout that subplot to get the audience excited about The Avengers, but not so many that the film lost sight of what its goal was. The focus of this movie is indeed on Tony Stark, and while it's true that there are a few subplots that occur throughout the film, I never felt that they interfered with the coherence of the storytelling.Even those who absolutely loved the first Iron Man will admit that the action was somewhat lacking, particularly the battle with Iron Monger at the end of the film, and this is where Iron Man 2 outdoes its predecessor the most. Not only is there quantitatively a bit more action to be found in this sequel, but also in terms of quality, I think it's a step up. The climax of this film, especially, is exhilarating from beginning to end.The performances and characters in Iron Man 2 are also very solid. Robert Downey Jr. is as charming and witty as he was last time around, further solidifying himself as the most spot-on comic book movie hero. The banter between him and Gwyneth Paltrow is also just as endearing, and the scenes that do focus on their relationship is time well spent. Don Cheadle is also great as Rhodey, as I bought him more as a military man than I did Terrence Howard in the first film. That being said, there is one scene involving his character that's just baffling (and you'll know it when you see it).Mickey Rourke, surprisingly, does a fine job as Whiplash, and while I think just a bit more time could've been spent developing his character, I'm starting to believe that the Iron Man villains aren't really important to the series in the same way that the ones from most other comic book movie franchises are. It's a pretty good thing, too, considering that I found the character of Justin Hammer to be, well, awful. To me, he just came across as a cartoon character, and I never once bought him as an intelligent multibillionaire.Iron Man 2 is a worthy successor to a great comic book film, and an excellent start to the summer movie season. Despite a few too many moments that ask the audience to suspend their disbelief, as well as one pretty pitiful villain, the film succeeds with its endearing characters, solid action, and engaging story. Also, stay after the creditsagain.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"A Bit Far From the First Movie's Impact, But Still Great","The reason why Don Cheadle is the new James Rhodes in this movie I don't know it, but he's performed just great and has contributed, very much, to the movie's success. It seems to me Robert Downey Jr had less action and time on scene, but Don Cheadle has filled that hole.About the villein, it has not been negative to opt for Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko; however, he pretty much did more with his mind than his body; the drons he built did more that him on his suit.So far so good. It's been a good to watch-movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Isn't it Ironic? I don't think,"There are plenty of rough spots to iron out in ""Iron Man 2"". I did not feel the super charismatic powers in this one as I did in the original. Not to say that the sequel was a total disaster, but there were some narrative elements that Director Jon Favreau and especially actor-turned-screenwriter Justin Theroux should have unwrinkled in this mediocre sequel. In this ironic chapter, Tony Stark (of course Iron Man himself) becomes a narcissist iron-tuned man machine in arrogantly telling the world that his iron weaponry is the country's main armed defense and they are helpless without him. Starks then faces new super challenges in being a identity-revealed super hero: competitive corporations try to develop their own ironisque design suits, his mechanical heart is causing his blood toxic level to rise, he faces pressure from a jealous U.S. Senator, is obsessed in pursuing his deceased father's vision to become a reality, and delegates his CEO executive powers of Starks Enterprises to his right-hand woman Pepper Potts. Of course, Iron Man does encounter new enemies. Those would come in the form of an avenging Russian named Ivan Vanco, who has constructed a miniaturized arc reactor of his own including whip-like attachments harnessing the electrical energy. And also the garrulous & obnoxious Justin Hammer, a CEO corporate rival who desperately tries to hammer out a super iron suit of his own to no avail. Starks' BFF Lt. Colonel James Rhodes does return in this installment in taking the high road on becoming an armed super hero of his own, in order to help Iron Man not to dive into a colossal downfall. We also get some spy eye-candy in this one with the gorgeous Natalie Rushman, Starks new assistant who may or may not be the Rush woman she claims to be; and there just might be another limelight to her persona. Robert Downey Jr. was again stellar as Starks/Iron Man, so I am down with him still playing the armed superhero. Gwyneth Paltrow as Potts lost some of that Potts' thespian high that she embodied in the first installment. Mickey Rourke did kind of wrestle with his underdeveloped role as Vanco. The undervalued Sam Rockwell did rock once more in the acting arena with his performance as the determined Hammer. I felt kind of cheated with Don Cheadle's flat work as Rhodes; Terrence Howard was more divine in the Rhodes role in the predecessor. I was elated that there was a casting trip to Johannsonburg by having the stunning Scarlett Johansson portray Natalie Rushman/Black Widow. I do credit Favreau for enterprising some challenging direction to ""Iron Man 2"", but this ""just in"", Justin Theroux's immensely chatty screenplay was too much talk and not enough creative bite. There were way too many mumbling elongated conversations in ""Iron Man 2"" which provided a mechanical restlessness in its viewing audience. So I am bit in the red with ""Iron Man 2"" but I am still down with Downey. *** Average",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
"The MCU's Worst Film To Date, Thanks to Bill O'Reilly","Jon Favreau returns to direct Iron Man 2, once again starring Robert Downey Jr., this time as the open superhero Iron Man; open meaning he has no secret identity. When things begin to stop going his way, he becomes very irrational, drinking at parties and ruining his reputation. When an enemy comes around, a Russian named Ivan Vanko, Tony must put aside his immature actions, and once again assume the role of the one and only Iron Man.To begin, I don't know what happened to Jon Favreau's mind in between Iron Man (2008) and this movie. Some movie-hating parasite must've crawled inside of Favreau's ear and influenced him to make a bad movie. This movie isn't, in my opinion at least, absolutely horrible, but no normal human could say this film is good. The cheap plot, bad dialogue, horrible villainization, and the fact that the whole film is a trailer for The Avengers (2012).To start with the pros, Robert Downey Jr. does pretty good as Tony Stark, and Gwyneth Paltrow as Pepper Potts is pretty good as well. Mickey Rourke as Ivan Vanko isn't really an overwhelming performance, and neither was Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. The best casting choice, however, was Bill O'Reilly as himself. Yes, Bill O'Reilly is in this movie. And he's the highlight. Just kidding.The special effects aren't the best, and it shows most during the fight scenes. The CG on Whiplash (Ivan Vanko) is really bad, especially during the final fight scene, in which the main villain fights for about two and a half minutes. There is honestly more arguing in this film more than any actual physical fighting.The plot is also very bad. Many plot holes exist throughout this movie. I feel as if Marvel sacrificed this movie so that The Avengers (2012) could be good, which paid off. However, I also feel that Marvel could have made both of the films good, without have making Iron Man 2 bad like it is. There's many ways this movie could have been better, starting with the introduction of our villains. There's an old saying that says ""a movie is only as good as its villain."" This is true most of the time, including this film as an example. Whiplash, or Ivan Vanko, is a villain that is only introduced by the history between his father (Anton Vanko) and Howard Stark, Tony's father.Overall, Iron Man 2 is a very washed down film, with a poor villain and some bad acting. The plot was cheap, and the exposition was way too heavy. I'm going to give Iron Man 2 a C-, or a 7 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Entertaining but underwhelming.,"If anything that's the media these days is that sequels rarely surpass the original in turns of epic scope and balls-to-the-wall action with the exception of The Dark Knight and Spider-Man 2 as well as the first two X-Men films and Hellboy 2. In my opinion Iron Man 2 is an entertaining and bombastic superhero movie that does well with what you expect from a sequel to the first hit back in '08 but it falls really short on some levels.Well, to put it quite frankly, the sequel itself doesn't feel as coherent as the first film which did a great job of setting up the hero and the suit he uses to fight evil with great doses of humor, warmth, and charm. There are so funny lines in the film but the jokes fall flat and don't have that serious bite that was prevalent in the first film. But the biggest flaw is the story. So many loose threads are left hanging and are never resolved again. I was pleased with the introduction of Whiplash(played excellently by Mickey Rourke)and his motivation to go toe-to-toe with ol' Shellhead, but the film rarely goes in depth into his personality and his inner workings for the audience to truly sympathize with this character. Add to the fact that Natasha Rushman/Romanov known as Black Widow has barely any decent character development along with Sam Jackson as Nick Fury and you have a film that leaves you cold in that respect.Though a plot is essential to telling the story, I was really let down by the lack of action scenes in the film. I enjoyed the fight between Iron Man and Whiplash in the early part of the film as well as between War Machine, but there wasn't enough action to get my adrenaline pumping like it did in the first film. By the end of the film where you thought you was gonna get a satisfying climax, the fight between Iron Man, War Machine, and Whiplash(who looked more impressive than when he first appeared) was over FAR too quickly for it to be truly awesome. Needless to say I was let down BIG time.There's one scene that I felt defied logic. When Iron Man arrives to confront Justin Hammer near the end of the film, Whiplash programs the drones to kill Iron Man and not only that, use War Machine to attack him as well; one of the best scenes in the whole film. But when the robots start firing their weapons, absolutely everyone in the building suffers NO casualties whatsoever. Then finally when Whiplash is defeated, he sets off a self-destruct switch that programs all the robots to explode yet in the aftermath of such event, we witness no injuries or deaths that actually happened. This movie was supposed to show the consequences of letting weapons of mass destruction out into the public yet we never witness the horror of it.With all that said, is Iron Man 2 a good film. The answer is a fair yes and I was entertained. However, there's no denying that it is the weakest compared to the first film which I enjoyed a lot. With the recent news that Iron Man 2 will tie into the upcoming Avengers film, I feel somewhat skeptical as to how this all is gonna play out. I like superhero movies but when they start crossing over into other universes, it becomes all too much. Iron Man 2 is a good film but it's story and plot leaves a lot to be desired.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Not as good as the first one,"Some of the magic is missing from ""Iron Man 2"" despite a supercharged plot, plenty of AC/DC in the soundtrack and the presence of Marvel luminaries like Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), Natasha Romanov (Scarlett Johannsson, who was great) and Clark Gregg's Agent Coulsen.Mickey Rourke is great as the villain who has history with the Stark family. He doesn't talk much, but is effective as the main foil for Robert Downey Junior's Tony Stark.There are some cool action sequences, including at the Monaco Historic Grand Prix.Still, the sequel to the movie that really kickstarted the billions of dollars made by the Marvel Cinematic Universe fell flat in comparison to the original.The middle third of the film dragged on and I lost interest. There were some scenes that could have been left on the cutting room floor, giving us a punchier film, without some of the banter that, for me, got less amusing as the movie wore on.Also, is it just me or is the idea of guys in those suits crashing into each other now less of a spectacle? They need to reinvent the combat scenes for the sequel.Still...eons better than anything Marvel released since about 2018 - I'm reviewing this in February of 2025 - so there's that, at least.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
Extremely enjoyable,"I wasn't super excited to rewatch this one, but I really enjoyed it. The cast was great as always, and the CGI was also incredible. I can agree with some complaints, such as the villain. But on an enjoyment scale alone, not including quality or any other factors, just how much I enjoyed watching it, I think I liked this one better than the first.

"My greatest creation, is you !","""Sometimes, the sequel enhances some features the first instalment did not accomplish whatsoever. Take the example of the humour, the coming undeveloped subplot as the Avengers Initiative and, finally, Stark's tough-trade past. Even so, it occasionally gets lost by the character's immaturity, the lack of some action pieces and the vague-Russian-villain evolution which ends up being some of the most mediocre of the entire MCU""Let's track this from the beginning: I found first Iron Man humorous, but not as much as the second one. If you contrast both flicks, the first one seems way too serious and basically heavy in the plot because it is the first time Tony experiments this sort of technology, taking up half the film. Meanwhile, the sequel is about discovering Tony's past and his true character identity. It deepens in his past and tries to comprehend the with-great-power-comes-great-responsibility lesson. Besides, Iron Man 2 is a crucial film in order to fully understand the Avengers because, as you could see, it introduces the S.H.I.E.L.D backstory and the leader-member of the organization: Nick Fury with his loyal assistant Natasha Romanoff. Therefore, the film serves to place future subplots and the motivation that each character will be looking for. In case you do not believe me, just take a closer sight on Captain America: Civil War. The result is a two-hour-no-boredom film with great potential and countless gags. Still, some folks might not like the sequel because it often seems as if the movie does not have a direction at all. As I have been told previously, the new immature facet of the drunk, reckless and self-centred superhero: Iron Man, ends up being annoying and a little frustrating amongst us. Similarly, as it works nearly as an Avengers induction, it loses focus when talking about the soul character of Tony Stark, because, as you could see, for now on Rhodes and Pepper turned out to be the centre of attention thanks to the sequel, in other words, the prominence of Tony Stark is reduced deliberately. Finally, but not least, the main villain is scarcely developed, making viewers conclude that his actions are taking place owing to the ghost of his father who appeared, by the way, for just one minute in the full-length film.I have to be honest; I was a little disappointed, but the humour brought at least compensates it a little (70/100)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"
good,"Their Finest (2016) is a charming yet flawed film that earns a solid 6/10. Gemma Arterton shines as Catrin Cole, bringing both warmth and determination to her role, while Bill Nighy provides much-needed humor and depth as the aging actor Ambrose Hilliard. However, some supporting characters feel underdeveloped, weakening the film's emotional impact. The cinematography effectively captures the atmosphere of 1940s London, offering a visually appealing experience, but it doesn't venture into anything particularly inventive. The story is engaging, with a mix of romance, humor, and drama, but its uneven pacing and the attempt to balance multiple tones leave it feeling somewhat disjointed. The soundtrack complements the setting and era well, but it lacks a memorable quality that could have added more to the film's overall impact. While Their Finest has its moments of charm and historical interest, it ultimately falls short of being truly compelling, making it a decent but not outstanding watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi"

Has aged well!,"I actually really like this film despite it being overlooked. I think the things I notice with the early MCU films is that they age really well because even though they are obviously sci-fi films they are much more grounded than modern superhero films and that works in their favour.In the case of Iron Man 2 I like how it shows the back and forth between the military/government and Stark over the ownership of the Iron Man suit, I think it makes a lot of sense following the ending of the first.I know the villains don't get as much screen time as they possibly should due to a lot of things going on in the story, but I actually did like Hammer and Vanko as characters and thought they worked well for the military aspect of the story.The visual effects hold up insanely well like the 1st and the action is very enjoyable, this film still feels big even 15 years on.Somewhere between a 7 and an 8 for me.
