"Slow and sometimes self-conscious, but still remarkable gorgeous & moving","The Double Life of Veronique (1991)Director Krzysztof Kieslowski is one of the undisputed poets of Cold War and post-Cold War cinema. The movies in his Polish/French trilogy, Blue, White, and Red, are finely tuned, sensitive, imaginative dramas that use mystery, music, psychology and visual fluidity to immerse you in another world that is beguiling and fascinating.That's exactly what goes on here. It's a stunning movie-making ""achievement"" in how it pulls off this unique blend of amorphous elements, leading you into the ambiguity of the director's invented world. And into the world (or worlds) of the lead characters, both played by Irene Jacob, a classic kind of restrained French (French-Swiss) actress with a limited range, but within that range she has penetrating beauty and a moving, melancholic aura for the camera, which lingers on her face through much of the movie. Her roles as the two women who are classic doppelgangers--they look alike, have similar talents (singing), and both have heart problems. And they overlap in reality for just a few seconds, with only one seeing the other until later, when the other finds she took a picture of the first.This is an unashamedly lofty film. It has high art written all over it, but not in the experimental or cutting edge way of independent filmmakers of this time. Rather, it pushes European mainstream film to its most refined limits, not giving up a narrative logic, not giving up musical scoring and photographic pyrotechnics, and not giving up a cast of beautiful people doing beautiful things. In fact, the star, first shown as a child, is looking at the stars in pure wonder, and the beauty of the world is sustaining and truly marvelous for her--and this I think is the life view of the director. That the world is amazing, filled with odd and beautiful coincidences, and is mostly there to be lived and enjoyed regardless.To some extent, he is both characters, both Veroniques. The allegories of 1980s Europe, splintering under Communism's last few years, have been written about a lot (the Polish Weronika gives herself to her music and dies for it, trapped somehow, the French Veronique is free to reject her talent, travel, and yet, ultimately, end up a puppet to her personal weakness). But the fact is, Kieslowski was both the successful Polish director who died young (though he didn't expect that I'm sure) for his art, and the successful expatriate living a life filled with art and pleasure. He embodied the modern Europe, filled with the heady optimism that led to the love of a new Europe without borders, infinite in its possibilities.It's worth noting that Communism has just fallen when this movie was made. There is a brief scene (the bus scene with the soldiers) that inserts this with, as usual, elegance. (Note here that he again makes the individual's inner needs more important than the greater politics.) The French Veronique is free to be hedonistic, the Polish version cannot quite do that, though you feel her struggle with what to do with her life as a singer.All of this is obviously impressive. For its intentions and its inner coherence, the movie is terrific. But it's also starting to feel self-important, a little overblown in both its allegories and even in the basic doppelganger hook that holds it together. It's also a slow movie. If you don't completely drown, happily, in the aesthetics of the film (which would be easy to do), you might find there are little moments made too important, too detailed, too unaware that the audience is getting ahead of the movie and is restless. For me this was in some of the musical segments, in the marionette scenes, and even in the very last moments, which should have blown me out of the water.Final word. I think it would help to see this film before the Three Colors trilogy, because they are better movies, especially ""Blue"" and ""Red."" I have seen ""Red"" several times, and it also stars Jacob, and I love it completely still. This predecessor is thinner in comparison, but only in comparison to this remarkable director's startling successes immediately after.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The most beautiful movie I've ever watched,"I still remember over 10 years ago watching this movie all alone in a theatre with no one else (Monday afternoon or some other week day time). Irene Jacob, the streets of France and Poland, the editing, the love scenes, the plastic ball reflections, and especially the music all are so beautiful that actually made me shivered and stunned.Kieslowski's in another world now.  I always worry whether it's possible to watch another movie that struck me so badly.  A million thanks to him for showing me the most beautiful film of my life (probably).p.s. this film has only been released in VHS - so ridiculous, a shame of the industry.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful/Complex - An Interesting mixture,"The above statement works not only as an honest description of the film, but also of the character (or characters) portrayed by Irène Jacob. The Double life of Véronique is not a film that allows easy description, it doesn't seem to fit in to any genre or category, it is a film that must be experienced under it's own terms, as a serious, hypnotic work of art. Director Kieslowski sets up the odd dreamlike atmosphere right from the start, using mirror reflections and odd camera distortions to show us the bizarre way that Veronique/Veronika sees the world around her. The use of sepia printing also gives the film an odd distilled look, taking us right out of any ""real"" reality, giving each of the frames something special. The problem this creates is that it takes away any real connection we have with the characters, we never really feel anything for them or are even that concerned for their outcomes, Kieslowski moves his actors around his ""stage"" in the same way the marionettes are manipulated in the film, but the film works on such a subtly hypnotic level I don't think that Kieslowski ever wanted us to feel part of this world. Kieslowski follows Veronique/Veronika through Paris and Poland, intimately probing her with close, hand-held camera, the cinema-verite effect of this making the viewer feel almost like a voyeur, following the women's every movements and encounters. The Double Life of Veronique is a film that definitely deserves to be seen and requires multiple viewings if we are to get everything out of it's complex, pre-destined narrative. A film full of beautiful images and haunting moods that you'll remember long after, if only there had been a little more focus on the characters I would certainly give it a 10. Maybe my next viewing will lift its marks. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The Movie & the Music,"Only a few of the previous comments on this movie has mentioned the use of music. Just like in Trois Couleurs Bleu, the music of La Double vie de Véronique is very indivisible from the film: the visual and the auditive form a united whole and also elements of it are directly part of the story. And when it comes to music made for film, Zbigniew Preisner's powerful score for this one is as good as it gets.When there is little dialogue, it is not just the images and expressions on Irène Jacob's face that tells the story, but also the powerful strains of music intermingled with it.Even with just these elements in place, it would be a movie worth seeing, though obviously a narrative based in little extent on dialogue and with less emphasis on a clear-cut story than your average American movie is unfortunately lost on some of the earlier commentators.And even this seemingly sparingly laid out narrative reveals itself to the careful watcher to be a rich tapestry of symbols, metaphors and hidden meanings. Kiéslowski, just as in his other movies, demands participation of the viewer, and the one who expects passive entertainment has found the wrong film to watch.Krzysztof never liked discussing meaning when it came to his movies, but liked keeping that up to the viewers, and few other directors have ever been able to lay out more food for thought and fruitful interpretation than him.I saw the Three Colours trilogy before seeing Véronique, and the many similarities, both musical and in visual narrative, makes it feel like it almost belongs together with those three to form a quartet. In some ways it has more in common with Blue than Red and White do.Had Juliette Binoche also been cast in the role of Véronique, as I understand that Krzysztof originally had intended, the similarities had been even greater. She was, however, occupied with shooting Les Amants du Pont-Neuf at the time I believe, and so Krzysztof opted for the less experienced Irène. I don't think the film is any worse for it: she is brilliant, and not just a pretty face as some people put it, but a very intelligent and aware actress as anyone who has seen her interview for the Red DVD release should discover if they haven't already.In short: a wonderful film, wonderful music, great acting. But not a movie for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Review for The Double Life of Véronique (no spoilers).,"Krzysztof Kieslowski's The Double Life of Véronique (originally titled La Double Vie de Véronique) might be the best film in the late director's accomplished oeuvre. Perhaps most lauded for his monumental Three Colors trilogy, Kieslowski first explored themes of duality, synchronicity, and fate in this cinematic reverie. Irène Jacob, also the star of Red, handles a double role as two women cut from the same metaphysical cloth -- the Polish Veronika and the French Véronique. Her presence as both women is at once whimsically childlike and sensually melancholic; relentlessly alluring, it is easy to see why she became Kieslowski's muse. Jacob is perfectly fluid in the shift between characters, an embodiment of ideal femininity, as dreamlike as the tone of the entire film.Actor and director are symbiotic, relying on hazy, autumnal ambiance and mood for narrative, utilizing a subtle minimalist approach to dialogue. This is fine art, unlike heavy-handed Hollywood productions. The tone is consistently ambiguous -- emotionally resonant, to be sure, but beyond a vaguely somber, wistful undercurrent, the movie allows the viewer to fill the ""empty space"" with his or her own thoughts and feelings. It's a true testament to Kieslowski's mastery, and few films are ever so transcendentally sublime.The lack of this masterpiece's availability on DVD is a sad affair. There are rumors of a release in 2005, but for fans of movies like Amélie hungry for something with a little more depth, The Double Life of Véronique comes most highly recommended -- even if you have to search high and low for a copy on VHS.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Beautiful, but somewhat unaffecting","Much of this is an adoration of French actress Iréne Jacob by Director Krzysztof Kieslowski; in a sense it is a homage to her, one of the most beautiful actresses of our time and one of the most talented. If you've never seen her, this is an excellent place to begin. She has an earnest, open quality about her that is innocent and sophisticated at the same time so that everything a man might want in a young woman is realized in her. Part of her power comes from Kieslowski himself who has taught her how she should act to captivate. He has made her like a little girl fully grown, yet uncorrupted, natural, generous, kind, without pretension, unaffected. She is a dream, and she plays the dream so well.The movie itself is very pretty, but somewhat unaffecting with only the slightest touch of blue (when the puppeteer appears by the curtain, the curtain is blue, and we know he is the one, since she is always red). The music by Zbignew Preisner is beautiful and lifts our spirits, highlighted by the soprano voice of Elzbieta Towarnicka. But the main point is Iréne Jacob, whom the camera seldom leaves. We see her from every angle, in various stages of dress and undress, and she is beautiful from head to toe. And we see her as she is filled with the joy of herself and her talent, with the wonder of discovery and the wonder of life, with desire, and with love.Obviously this is not a movie for the action/adventure crowd. Everything is subtle and refined with only a gross touch or two (and no gore, thank you) to remind us of the world out there. Véronique accepts the little crudities of life with a generous spirit, the flasher, the two a.m. call, her prospective lover blowing his nose in front of her... She loves her father and old people. She is a teacher of children. She climaxes easily and fully. To some no doubt she is a little too good to be true. And she is, and that is Kieslowski's point: she is a dream. And such a beautiful dream.An actress playing the character twice in a slightly different way has occurred in at least two other films in the nineties: there was Patricia Arquette in David Lynch's Lost Highway (1997) and Gwyneth Paltrow in Sliding Doors (1998). It's an appealing venture for an actress of course and when the actress is as talented as these three are, for the audience as well.Note that as Weronika/Véronique is in two worlds, Poland and France, so too has always been Kieslowski himself in his real life. It is interesting how he fuses himself with his star. This film is his way of making love to her.Kieslowski died in 1996 not long after finishing his celebrated trilogy, Trois Couleurs: Bleu (1993); Rouge (1994) and Bialy (White) (1994). We could use another like him.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

Divine,"Probably the best film of the decade. These are some keywords I think best suit this film: Religious, Fatherhood, Duplicity, Fullness, Sensuality, OffbeatDue to the blasphemous american rants below (I can´t imagine a single movie from the USA in the 90s better than this one, sorry for that), I decided to write about this peculiar film. I think the film is more accessible for european viewers, the same way Dawn by law might be for american viewers (I can´t bear that pretentious american underground movies at all, with cool men swearing all the time, trying to be funny... I can´t identify with most of nineties american characters). There are many american art house films buffs as well, so I can´t say this is a general fact, it´s just my view anyway.Regarding the development of the characters, Tsylia probably couldn´t understand at the beginning of the film how both women are described so poeticly. Weronicka is watching at the stars, while Veronique is watching the leaves fall. I see this is not evident but it  says a lot about the two. Weronicka is more spiritual, magical, and Veronique is more practical, more ""down to earth"". If you cannot see the metaphores throughout the film you will not grasp anything about the development of the characters, that´s for sure. Furthermore, Irene Jacob performance is sublime, you can see on her face so many ""difficult to express"" sensations, she´s not just a beautiful face as it has been stated below (I can name hundreds of pretty american girls on stupid films, I was shocked to read Irene Jacob is just pretty, couldn´t these people see she´s a valuable actress as well). In any case she´s pretty in the sense Catherine Deneuve is, I mean she´s not the common beatiful woman, you can see by his gestures that she feels alone in the world, that she feels the fullness of life, ... She sometimes seems like an angel in this film (Weronicka).I´m an atheist, but I admit the religious or spiritual feeling of the film engages anyone. The film evokes the idea that gifted people such this soprano singer have a spare part somewhere in the world, the same way the puppetier has a spare marionette for the one he uses most.God is not mentioned but the scenes are revealing: Veronique caresses the bark of a thick tree in the very last scene, which could signify her real father as well, or just the idea of fatherhood.The music is ten out of ten, if you feel nothing while listening to Preisner´s masterpiece, you´d better not say you´re sensitive anymore. This is his best for me alongside with the music for Short story of a killing and Damage soundtrack which sounds cruel and mysterious to me.I can´t think of any other film more precious and lyrical than this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Dreamlike sepia tones,"I saw this film about 14 years ago. I saw it again recently and it still has a power about it. It contains some extremely beautiful imagery. My favourite scene is the brief moment when Weronika throws her ball at the ceiling and all the dust falls down on her face as she stays still for a moment. Simple and stunning. It is not my favourite Kieslowski, I would reserve that place for Blue and then No End and the Dekalog series but it has a lovely quality to it. I have never liked the ending really but enjoy the way it comes about. The general concept it strong and it is this that gives the film a slightly haunted quality which it pulls off. Jacob is amazing to watch and the story seems woven as a dream. It is a forerunner for his masterpiece to follow and even a moderately good Kieslowski film trounces most others.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
The Music and Irène Jacob,"""The Double Life of Veronique"" is also focusing on the connection made between two people like Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy or his heaven,hell and Purgatory.But it is not about two people with a strong bond or two twins.The two girls are not merely soul mates,they're two versions of the same person.Like an old belief that after we die, our body will appear in different circumstances and live a new life.(in here they live two different life simultaneously).The power of music in Kieslowski's film is inevitable.The scenes are not significant by themselves,the impact of the ideas and images with the powerful music make the film special.Kieslowski well used colors and camera filters to create an ethereal atmosphere which was very helpful in creating the films sense .I think the music and Irène Jacob performance were the most outstanding pieces of the film.The central question of the film is ""Is it just a matter of chance that one thinks and acts as one does?..Is there something as free will?""...It is a question of our lives too.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Interesting and engaging,"Weronika lives in Krakow, Poland and is an aspiring classical singer. Veronique lives in Paris and her career is also in music. They look identical but have far more than this in common.Interesting, engaging drama from Krzysztof Kieslowski (Three Colours - Red/Blue/White, A Short Film About Killing). Sensitively, lavishly told story by Kieslowski, drawing you in. This is helped by an excellent performance by Irene Jacob as the two Veroniques. Quite enchanting.Not perfect, however. The connection between the two is never fully explored and I kept waiting for the film to kick up a gear, as it felt like it was just coasting the whole way through. Kieslowski does a great job of setting everything up but then doesn't provide the powerful, profound ending to tie it all up.Overall, watchable but a bit disappointing.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Superb! Existential feast of ideas from the Master!,"Kieslowski drives me to hyperbole, but I am not exaggerating when I say that this film is truly one of the best films ever made. It's an exploration of identity, presentiments, relationships (with the ""self"" and others) and the soul. Such themes could be messed around,  but in the hands of such talented people, these so-called ""irrationalities"" are brought to life with beauty, subtlety and intelligence.The music is amazing, the cinematography is stunning and Irene Jacob is wonderful. This is one of greatest films to explore the idea of the soul - and one of the best films, in general. If you haven't seen it, prepare to be moved by the metaphysical, the mysterious, and the humanity of the piece. If you like the Trois Couleurs trilogy, you'll surely love this too and maybe even feel like you've returned home, to the tree, to life, to the beginning - Kieslowski had the ability to move us all in such ways. Enjoy his beautiful film!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Empty beauty.,"I tried to like this movie.  I saw it years ago and was not impressed.  I then saw Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy Blue, White, and Red which I thought were wonderful so I thought I'd give Veronique another chance.  Well it wasn't any better the second time.  The movie had no substance.  It seems to be enamored  with Irene Jacob's beauty lingering on shots of her face.  The movie is worthwhile for that, Ms Jacob is indeed a beauty, but it doesn't carry the movie.  There were glimpses of what was to come in his subsequent movies though not enough to fill the movie.  If you like to look at beautiful women's faces this is the movie for you.  I like a bit more from movies, some soul to flesh out the face.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
like watching a film where every third scene is missing,"The story of two identical women, born on opposite ends of Europe and connected only by a tenuous spiritual link neither one is fully aware of, asks the question: are we really alone in the world? Bur director Krzysztof Kieslowski doesn't provide much else besides an affirmative answer, and the concept itself is limited because the two Veroniques are never allowed to meet (if they did the whole thing would be just another Twilight Zone episode, with subtitles). It's certainly a beautiful movie, with quite a few magical moments balanced against an unforgivably vague narrative concerned mostly with the French Veronique's pursuit of an enigmatic puppeteer. Along the way are some intriguing, teasing suggestions of several more-then-coincidental similarities between the two women, but the effect is not unlike watching a film where every third scene is missing, and because the burden of meaning is placed entirely on the viewer it will likely infuriate anyone expecting a more coherent story.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful haunting storytelling,"I still listen to the haunting music that weaves it's way through this film and it never fails to move me. The whole film is almost like a modern day ghost story, following its own logic through the simplest but most effective storytelling techniques, beautifully crafted by a master director. Irene Jacob has never been better than here, and I would recommend it highly.",,Anonymous,Music
Poetry and Music,"Like Last Year at Marienbad this is a film so beautiful that its worth viewing even if there is no meaning to it.  The use of light and shadow is spectacular, the music is divine, and the camera is constantly seeking and finding beauty in every shot.Looking at the postings so far it seems everyone has a different explanation, so I might as well throw mine into the mix.  To me Veronique/Weronika are twin angels being manipulated (guided might be a better choice of word) by God (or an abstract Divine) for some unfathomable purpose.  Consider the use of the puppeteer as a metaphor for the condition, look at how he says he makes two because they are fragile and break easily (just as Weronika breaks in her concert).  Veronique speaks of how she always knows what to do in every situation as if her life is leading up to something.  Theres a telling scene about midway through the film where Veronique walks between shadows through a slender path of light her face gazing rapturously at the the sun.  Both V's appreciate and reflect the beauty around them: light, shadows, the falling rain, ... highly reminiscent to me of the 'fallen' angels in Wings of Desire.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Masterpiece,"This is a film which defies explanation. The story, on the one hand is quite simple in concept. There is a linking force between two women who live countries apart yet somehow have a sense of the other, even a love and kinship with each other. The one of them seems ignorant of it until that link is severed, at which point she sets about trying to understand the link she has lost.Truly, what sets apart the film is not the unique concept (though it is fascinating) but, rather, the way Kieslowski tells the story through dreamlike remembrances, refractory light and reflection, beautifully haunting and lifting music, and a performance from Irene Jacob which must have been a combined effort between her and the director.Beginning with the latter, I have to say that there is something odd yet wonderful about Irene Jacob's (""Au Revoir les Enfants"") performance as both Veronique and Weronica. Avoiding voice over to add interior monologue is a challenge. When you are working with an actress who performs as brilliantly as Jacob the answer is acting. At almost no point in the film are you left wondering what she feels or what she is thinking. Her face says it all. Her body language punches it home.Hers is a face which can shine forth with innocence, passionate desire, heart-heaviness, soul rending grief, and exuberant joy, even as she astounds with singing performances which carry away the audience. She really is what makes this film work. Without her there is nothing here to watch.This understanding that what the audience connects to is through what they see and experience through the film allows Kieslowski to create a true work of art. Like The Mona Lisa, theories abound as to what he meant by it but ultimately he has left it up to us viewers to find meaning within.Many have said that they see religious allegory. Others see supernatural connection of spirit between people or even reincarnation. For me, There are some key scenes that lead me to believe that it is, at least in part, about generational knowledge and human collective consciousness.In many ways it seems that Veronique learns from the experiences that her counterpart Weronica has had even when she is totally unaware of the connection. She has a sense of what she should do in any given moment or situation, despite never having had a similar experience. She just knows what is the right thing to do.This theory of mine is furthered by the presence of both girls' fathers and their interesting relationships with them. The one seems far closer than the other but is that because she has learned from the other's mistakes or because we must all learn the balance between a past generations knowledge and our own self knowledge.In ways, I think this film encourages us to find a balance between the two, realizing that we are more than just ourselves or even the various possible paths we could take through life. We are communal beings who live amongst others, not just in our physical environments, work, school, and home, but also in our spirits, minds, and hearts.The film provokes one to rumination and thought, to be sure. I am confident that while another person may see ""The Double Life of Veronique"" and see something completely different within it, they will see something which captures their heart and wakens their spirit as only great art is able to do.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
the great puppeteer,"Seeing the films of Krzysztof Kieslowski is a special experience, now, more than two decades since he stopped making films, and died soon after. The Polish director's relative short life (he died at the age of 54) and career (less than two decades) is now turning into legend. Each of his films shows the quality and the emotion of a true master of the cinema. ""The Double Life of Veronique"" (or ""La double vie de Véronique"" in French) is one of his best known movies, made at the peak of his cinema career, between the Decalogue and the Three Colors trilogy. Somehow I missed it at release. Now, in the perspective of the life and death of the director, not only that it stays as a remarkable piece of cinema but it is enriched with new significance.Fate and identity are the two big topics of this film. Have you ever had the feeling that you are not alone or even unique in the Universe, that somewhere or maybe in some other time, a parallel destiny is shared with yours? Did you ever feel like your life is not the result of your own decisions, that higher forces manipulate you life, same as a puppeteer controls his marionettes? If you ever felt something like this or if you can understand or imagine such feelings, this story of two young women, living in two different parts of Europe, sharing talents, feelings and fate without their lives ever intersecting for more than a few seconds, this story should not seem strange at all.Beautiful films (and books, and paintings, and musical works) have complex layers of meanings and a multitude of details that are revealed to the viewer, reader, listener. This is exactly the case with ""La double vie de Véronique"". One can use multiple keys to read the story. There is a political reading about the parallel destinies of the two women who are born and live on the two sides of the curtain that divided Europe and was just falling down by the time the film was made. There is a philosophical reading about destiny and about the controllers of the destiny (the puppeteer, the writer who creates characters and write about their destinies). There is a religious reading with multiple symbols that ask to be examined from the name of the main character to the music that is sung and played during the film.Each of the scenes includes details that support the multiple stories and have their place in it, in some cases relating to other scenes in the peer story. The only exception was the secondary thread about presumptive perjury by the French Veronique whose sense I could not decipher. Music plays an important role, as the two women are musicians, they sing and teach music that reflects their relation with fate and God. So does light, which is in some cases maneuvered by the characters. The mirrors also show up in many scenes, sometimes as a reflection of the self, in other cases as a gate to the other side, as in Lewis Carroll's stories. Shades and mysteries follow the characters and the viewers at any corner and in any moment.Kieslowski's mastering of the art of cinema is matched by the superb acting of Irène Jacob. She is strange and beautiful, sensitive and expressive. I can also wonder why her star paled after Kieslowski stopped making films, and why other film directors could not make better use of her beauty and talent. She is part of the same generation of French and French-speaking actresses as Juliette Binoche for example, but their post 1995 careers were so different. What a pity.I am happy to have discovered ""La double vie de Véronique"", even if so late. It's a film to see and see again.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
fine art-house film of sadness,Weronika and Véronique are two unrelated connected lives. Weronika (Irène Jacob) is a singer in small town Poland. She gets an audition for a choir. Then she sees french tourist Véronique (Irène Jacob) taking pictures. Weronika collapses and dies in her first performance. Véronique feels the lost and quits singing.There is a pervasive saddest throughout the movie. The film is drained of bright colors. Weronika's life is the first 30 minutes and the rest is Véronique dealing with a lost that she can't fully comprehend. Irène Jacob is a beauty. She has a great dreamlike quality. However the two characters don't have enough separations. It's a fine art-house film of sadness.,6.0,Anonymous,Music
Doesn't Come Together,"There are some beautiful moments in this film, things that make you feel like there are depths of truth that are being reached but it doesn't all come together.In the end it feels a randomly generated series of scenes pieced together that don't form a bigger whole. Picture this: a man walking his dog with a baguette underneath his arm, cut to a girl playing frisbee by herself fetching the frisbee each time she throws it, cut to another girl who looks like the first but isn't who steals the man's baguette. Drama. Intrigue. Mystery. Or more likely - something that just doesn't make sense. And this is the camp that the film belongs to.It is a dangerous move when you abandon many notions of narrative - sometimes it can pay off big, but for me, this didn't make it. Still as I said moments of beauty and maybe you'd get more out of the overarching project of the film than me....",6.0,Anonymous,Music

"Life is paradoxical, but not that much.","It is no wonder that it was hard to Kieslowki to find a suitable title for this movie. In fact, the double life of Veronique is the leading, but not the main theme of the work.Consider the two halves of the movie corresponding to the lives of the two Veroniques. The second half of the film is mostly devoted to the strange and failed love encounter of the French Veronique. By making her lover a puppet player who can't resist manipulating or taking advantage of Veronique, either for his books or his plays, Kieslowski seems to hint to the idea of Veronique being no more than a puppet of life. This now becomes the main theme, in which the double life is but another product.But it was not essential to Kieslowski to simply hint at the mystery of life, so paradoxical as to produce the strange events shown in this film. As he later proved in RED, there IS an order of life, even if paradoxical to man's mind; an order capable of transcending - and transgressing - our rational perspectives. The only problem for Kieslowski - as for the puppet player/writer - was to make sure that these transgressions occur and are in fact possible. And it is here, IMHO, that the film fails: I couldn't really believe the ""metaphor"" of two women being the same, at the same time, one feeling like the other, or one following the other's story. It is not like the (true) story of the journalist finding himself in a novel by Cortazar, who never knew him. This fact often quoted by Kieslowski, revealed to him the strange symmetry of life when rightly perceived by man and was the sort of rationally-twisting life symmetries that he wanted to show in his movies.But in this work these rationally-twisting symmetries are  too ""worked-out"", too artificial to be credible. Given that this was the stuff of the color trilogy, the Double Life of Veronique may rightly be considered as a first approach to such major artistic and visionary problem.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Split Alice,"I save films. By that I mean that some films I expect to be so precious that I want to save them for some future drought, or blue period where I need spiritual insulin. Or it may be that a valued filmmaker has died and I know there is only so much to see new and I want to pace it through my life.Kieslowski is something of a demigod in my film world. It isn't that he has mattered so much in the sense of affecting me. Its because he can push geography with the slightest touch, infer emotional richness with the most subtle of motions, show us beauty headon  headon without artifice. His the most delicate power I know in cinema. His ""Decalogue"" is complex, open, engineered to be contradictory in ways that seem natural. But they are not where the real juice is. Its merely where he worked out the way to weave vision and narrative conflict with his companion and creative partner.It's ""Three Colors"" where it pays off. These are miraculous and I wish them on any open soul. They will tear you gently in ways you will not notice for years, and then know all of a sudden when you meet someone.In between ""Decalogue and ""Colors,"" we have this, essentially an adventure in moving from Polish to French vocabulary, both emotional and chromatic. Here we see some of the strokes we will encounter later, in one colored film even with the remarkable Irene. But he seems unsure here. Things aren't integrated between cinema and narrative as they were before and would be afterward. The eye doesn't inform with curious discovery, instead seems to glance around and hover.I suppose it is because the story isn't well developed in the way that others are. The deal with Kieslowski I think (beyond the beauty) is that he is able to infer future urges that probably will loop back into places and persons we see. (He closes a very few of these ordinary loops in the third colors film). But he never closes them, not the ones that matter. So we are left with our own emotions going ahead and anticipating results that matter to us, things started and not finished, breath sent out for us to catch and breath.This film is based on Alice in through the Lookingglass, with a number of less-than-deft fixtures to the source. He tries to build grand arcs of anticipated futures around this symmetry but they aren't fragile and supported by our wishes as we have elsewhere. I think it was simply a time of adjustment for him, and I cannot recommend this, even though I saved it for decades.I will suggest that if you do watch it, see the same story, the same emotional effects, the same tantalizing near-closure in ""Sex and Lucia"" by someone less gifted with the eye, but more gifted with the mysteries of women. Watch out for the delicate tearing.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.",,Anonymous,Music

Parallel lives ideally bound together.,"Parallel lives ideally bound together by some banal photographic clicks doomed to shake the soul and to generate a visual vortex determined by the perception of an impalpable, aleatory mystery, maybe some anomalous violence within the limits of a distortion in the space time continuum. Strange consonances, mutual echoes of existences fastened to invisible threads that join together and keep apart. Subterranean feelings of overwhelming voids lived like sudden and unexpected moments of melancholy wrapped in mystery. Hands leaned against the bark of the trees in order to penetrate the arcane vibrations of the nature and to trace the broken thread that join us to a parallel existence swept away forever, whose fleeting trace can be seen on a creased sheet of sensitive paper. Kieslowski chooses the sweet and gentle Irene Jakob to play the main character of his first movie after the worldwide famous Dekalog. It's impossible to forget the scene where the protagonist ""lifts her eyes to the sky like a flower to the rain"" (please, Sting, excuse me you can) to receive the raindrops in her face with open arms and to feed on their tonic energy.The movie is imbued with a flavor of magic innocence and candor and painted in light tones, while the music composed by Zbigniew Preisner seems to burst forth from the bowels of the film substance. The director models all around the figure of the protagonist a world of the same consistence of the marzipan, the same gracefulness of harmonious notes levitating in the air, the same delicacy of a handful of romantic kisses given passionately. All things considered, « The double life of Véronique » looks like an inexhaustible hymn to the life and to the capacity of regeneration peculiar to our vital tissues after an indirect experience of death, thank to the discovery of the absolute love, impalpable like the atmosphere that surrounds the whole story, unlikely and ethereal at the same time, sublimed by strange relations referring to subtle Kieslowskian metaphors always on the look-out. A kind of love bred by sudden tumults of passions wrapped in the thickest mystery, that come true thank to mysterious sound messages referring to a station touched lightly by the shadow of destiny.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Elusive and impenetrable poetry,"Two exact look-alikes, the Polish Weronika and the French Véronique, inhabit the world of Krzysztof Kieslowski's memorable The Double Life of Véronique. Both women are played by the same actress, the radiant Iréne Jacob, winner of the Best Actress award at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival. Born on the same day, they have green eyes and dark hair, congenital heart problems, and are talented singers, one a music teacher, the other a choir soprano, though each has a somewhat different personality. By its very nature, the story defies rational explanation and Kieslowski does not offer any, but the premise suggests that the separate self is an illusion, a projection of mind rather than an inherent expression of ultimate reality.Shot in Krakow, Poland and Paris, France, the film is suffused with the stunning cinematography of Slawomir Idziak and a sublime score by Zbigniew Preisner beginning with the song she sung by Weronica at her debut concert in Krakow. Weronica's story fills the movie's first thirty minutes. Weronica's exuberance and childlike innocence are captured in the film's early moments when, after an outdoor choir performance, she remains standing wide-eyed in the pouring rain, looking up at the sky, as the others run for shelter.Strangely though, Weronica tells others about an odd feeling that she is not alone, a feeling that is reinforced when she catches a glimpse of her doppelganger, Véronique, in the center of a Krakow square photographing a political protest demonstration (though she does not pursue her or mention the incident to family or friends). Though Weronica's desire to be a pianist was thwarted in an accident, her beautiful singing voice enables her to win a competition to join a musical company. As the young singer begins to perform her first concert, however, her heart condition sadly prevents her from continuing and the film shifts the remainder of its attention to Véronique.As we first see Véronique, she is in the middle of making love but suddenly bursts into tears without explanation, the incident occurring at the same moment when Weronika suffers serious heart problems at her concert in Krakow. Véronique has given up a promising singing career because she intuitively knows that it is ""wrong for her"" and instead becomes a music teacher of young children. During this same period she also schedules a cardiogram as if she has had some kind of warning. The film is propelled by the emotions Véronique is experiencing: a strange feeling of being alone in a suddenly uncertain world and an unexplained sense of loss.The mystery deepens when she begins to receive enigmatic packages in the mail from Alexandre (Philippe Volter), a puppeteer whose exquisite marionette performance she has seen and whose gifts are tied to objects from his children's stories. Concluding from listening to a cassette tape that was recorded at the Saint Lazare train station, she meets Alexandre, but her expectations of love are thwarted by his mundane reasons for the subterfuge, although it serves to enhance her sense of closeness with Weronica.Though it is tempting to search for some sort of explanation, The Double Life of Veronique is better off not being analyzed but should be savored for its elusive and impenetrable poetry. If it has any point to make other than its captivating quality as a work of art, it may be that, in life, energy is wasted in trying to figure things out and that the only thing that makes sense is to submerge ourselves in its beauty and succumb to its mystery.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"""The Double Life of Veronique"" is an abs...","""The Double Life of Veronique"" is an absolutely beautiful movie in every sense.  The film tells the story of two identical-looking women, the Polish Veronika and the French Veronique, who seem to be aware of each other in some way, but who have never met.  The movie doesn't attempt to explain the similarity of these characters; it is far more interested in telling their stories and leaving the mystery as a sort of resonant background that colors the events that unfold.  The radiantly beautiful Irene Jacob plays the double role of the title characters, and she is brilliant; the film doesn't give her very much dialog, but she communicates volumes with her facial expressions and body language.  The cinematography is gorgeous, with most of the film shot through amber-colored filters of one form or another, essentially eliminating the color blue from the movie and giving everything a slightly distant look.After seeing Kieslowski's three subsequent movies, his wonderful ""Three Colors"" trilogy, it seemed to me that ""Veronique"" was almost intended to be a prequel to them, with scenes in each movie alluding to scenes in the others.  Certainly, anyone who loved ""Three Colors"" will appreciate ""Veronique"" as well.Overall Rating:  9 (out of 10), or 4 starts (out of 4)",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Brooding film about two physically identical girls mysteriously linked in numerous aspects,"Two women , Polish Veronika and french Veronique (Irene Jacob's luminous interpretation) , are born on the same day in different countries , share a singing talent , a cardiac ailment and , although the two never meet , a strange awareness of each other. Meantime , they have boyfriends who may be able to help with their existential issues . Each of us is matched somewhere in the world , by our exact double -someone who shares our thoughts and dreams.An interesting and strange movie about two identical women , each has talent for music , each recognises affinities with her obscure soul-twin, each entertains doubts about her current lover and each has a a weak heart , and along the way , we learn from their suffering ; both women contend with the ups and downs of their individual lives , with Véronique embarking on an outlandish love story with a puppeteer . Stars Irene Jacob who's terrific and unforgettable as the two women and director Krzysztof creates some spellbinding and gorgeous scenes , but the audience has to willing to forget plot for atmosphere . Kielowski may not proffer the lucid moral insights of his earlier Dekalog series , but it is hard to imagine anyone else making a more mesmerizing and amazing study of spiritual disquiet . Prior to filming , Krzysztof Kieslowski asked Irène Jacob if she ever wished for a different name when she was a child . Jacob told him that she had always wanted to be named Veronique , and the name was used for her character . According to Harvey Weinstein, after seeing ""The Double Life of Veronique"" at Cannes, Quentin Tarantino approached him to enlist his aid in casting Irène Jacob as Fabienne in ""Pulp Fiction"", Jacob turned down the role to participate in the film Three colors : Red . If the story is simplicity itself , this certainly not an easy movie , but coherence is assured by Irene Jacob's dual acting . This is first collaboration between Krzysztof Kieslowski and Irène Jacob , they subsequently worked together on : Red . Whether you swallow what seems to be Kieslowski's thesis or comes down to a matter of faith ; but there's no denying his ability or compassion to invest places , objects and passing moments with an almost numinous power .Kielowski carries out an effortless control of mood and proceeding a subtle use of repeated motifs . Mr. Kieslowski started his career shooting documentaries and later became associated with the ""cinema of moral anxiety"" movement. It grouped several Polish directors, including Krzysztof Zanussi and Andrzej Wajda, and aimed at depicting the conditions of Poles under communism . His best known work was the Three Colors trilogy: Three colors : Red (1994), Three colors : White (1994) and Three colors : Blue (1993).

Beautiful visuals,"I loved the use of glass in this film, to distort images, add color tint, and cast partial reflections. There is obvious symbolism in these types of gorgeous visuals, the use of mirrors, and a sprinkling of supernatural elements that convey the central premise of the film, that we may have a double out there somewhere in the world, leading a separate and yet spiritually connected life. Without spoiling anything, there are memorable point of view shots and dreamlike images that are truly haunting.Kieslowski is artful in telling this story, applying a light touch and not turning it into standard fare where everything is tidied up and thoroughly explained. That's probably part of the point, that there may be things in the world that defy rational explanation, things that we get glimmers of only through our intuition, or senses. On top of the intriguing premise, you have the stunning Irene Jacob in the double role of Weronika and Veronique, and her performance is wonderful.Where the film fell a little short for me was in the narrative, particularly when the setting shifted to France. The pace got a little too slow for my taste, and there were elements of the story (like the false testimony Véronique offers to provide to help a girlfriend) that seemed extraneous. That was where a little more connective tissue between the parallel lives, or broader picture of the concept would probably have made it more interesting. At least on the night I saw it, this was a case where the story didn't keep up with the visuals, but despite that, I thought it was well worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Soft porn to lift the tired plot left me cold from the start. Others love this kind of movie. It has all sorts of mysteries and what's going on here moments that passed for movie making when this film was made. It seemed like new ground to some but it wasn't.

"Life, Conscious, Connection, and Death.","The Double Life of Veronique | 10/10This is an incredibly haunting and poetic work that raises a plethora of questions regarding life, death, and the unexplainable connection that some people share. I was stuck in a sort of trance while watching this, as beautifully photographed scenes seemed to follow one after the other for the film's entirety.There wasn't a moment that I had lost interest, and the questions posed throughout are some that I found myself thinking about on many different occasions as a child. Do we, perhaps even simultaneously, share the same thoughts, feel the same feelings, and take part in the same actions as another person we have never met? Is it more than instinctual for us to avoid certain things, or act in certain ways? This film spoke to these questions, but of course never answered them. It turns out, I believe, that there are no answers to begin with.This is the fourth Kieslowski film I've seen, and most certainly the best. Visually, it shares a few things in common with the Colors Trilogy, and Irène Jacob (Veronique and Veronika) was actually the main character in Red. Her acting is extremely good in both films, and the mood she creates in this one is understated, but incredibly graceful. I should mention the music in the film as well, which in addition to being beautifully presented, plays an important role in the connection between the two women. This is one of the best films ever made, presented by a man of great vision who left us far too soon.",,Anonymous,Music

"Disappointed on first viewing, more impressed on the second","This is a story of two women, the Polish Weronika and the French Véronique. Both women are played by the stunningly beautiful and captivating Irène Jacob. Weronika gets her story told in the first third and then Véronique has her turn. In addition to their being identical in physical appearance the two women share many other traits. Both are musically talented, have similar heart conditions, are the same age, and have parallel experiences. While the two never meet, they intuit the existence of each other in some mysterious ways. This storyline may be hard to swallow for the literal minded, but the movie is not out to convince us of anything, but rather to create a mood and have us consider possibilities. I think most people have wondered who on the earth most resembles them in appearance and experience and this film taps into that speculation by way of exaggeration. And who knows, is what happens in this movie any stranger than the existence of entangled particles at the atomic scale where a change in the state of one effects a change in the other no matter the distance separating them?Much is left to the interpretation of the viewer and anyone who is looking for some definite meaning will most likely be disappointed. Many scenes and events seem to be of little relevance. For example, when Weronika is having an acute heart problem she looks up and sees a man in an overcoat walk by and expose himself. These ridiculous events certainly happen in everyday life, but why put this in here? There is a stern, scowling woman who appears in both stories, but there is no hint given as to her tie-in.This is artfully filmed and could be considered a warm-up for Kieslowski's ""Three Colors: Red,"" since many scenes are lighted in soft red light and many physical objects are red. The lighting takes full advantage of Ms. Jacob's beauty.Given the musical talents of the two women, it is not surprising that music plays a key role in the film. There is a concert scene that has Weronika singing an incredibly magnificent aria. I played that scene several times. The soundtrack composed by Zbigniew Preisner lends a haunting quality to the proceedings and much would be lost without it. In a playful twist, music from an 18th-century Dutch composer, Van den Budenmayer, is referenced and played. Turns out that this is a pure creation of Preisner.The Criterion Collection DVD has an alternate ending for the U. S. version. Any additional significance contained therein was lost on me.When I first watched this I did not much appreciate it. Thinking that maybe I had missed something I watched it again and was glad that I did, since I found it much more engaging. Perhaps I was too busy reading subtitles on first viewing and missed the exceptional visual qualities. And I was better able to follow the subtle courtship game that Véronique and her suitor were playing.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
an okay movie,"This film was moderately interesting and had a very haunting musical score. It concerns two women who are not related but are identical twins--complete with some sort of inexplicable psychic connection. That unexplained connection along with a relatively dull story line resulted in my being rather disengaged from the film. Stylistically speaking it is a lovely film, as were the director's trio of films Blue, White and Red--which I much prefer. Their stories also feature similar music, excellent cinematography and are VERY unusual films but they just kept me more interested and their stories just seemed better developed and less silly. To me, this is an interesting film but a bit of a misfire.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"""The double life of Véronique"" is visually meticulous, sensitive and whose originality has lost none of its superbness","Released in 1991, ""The double life of Véronique"" helped Irène Jacob to forge her career as she won the Cannes Festival Best Actress Award thanks to her double role as Weronika and Véronique. The strength of the film lies in this omnipresent connection between the two women that look alike, feel each other's emotions and yet they have never met. Krzysztof Kieślowski, that tragically passed away five years later, created this masterpiece that marked his career : a wise mix of poetry, whose plot oscillates between dream and reality. The silences, the palpable emotions, the almost-buried memories, the constant distress feed this synergy between the two women. The whole movie excels thanks to the puppets' play, a real metaphor of the connection between the women. The yellowish photography, sometimes flirting with a well-polished sepia, enhances the emotions and the actor's glances. ""The double life of Véronique"" is visually meticulous, sensitive and whose originality has lost none of its superbness since its released.

Beautiful from start to finish,"Two identical women, one living in France, the other in Poland, cross their lives, even though they do not know each other, in a strange but profound connection.Kieslowski was more than a director, he was a visual poet, a tragedy genius, and he was one of the biggest losses in European cinema in recent decades.As for the film itself, it explores the duality of the human being, our faith, and the existential issues of mundane life.The long pauses, the scenes without dialogue, only with expressions and sounds, are key points in this narrative, in the exact amount and at the right moments.It's necessary to embrace the atmosphere of the film since the start of it, so that we can understand the hidden details, the metaphors and the symbolism, typical of the director (very present in the Triology of Colors, especially in Rouge, my favorite work by Kieslowski).Irène Jacob, playing the 2 main roles, does not disappoint, and she's a truly inspiration and a role model for new coming actresses.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The mesmerising lives of Weronika and Veronique,"Having loved Krzysztof Kieslowski's ""Three Colours Trilogy"", especially 'Three Colours: Red', those films made me interested in seeing more his work, with 'The Double Life of Veronique' and 'Dekalog' being particularly highly recommended.While not quite as good as the ""Three Colours Trilogy"" (or at least as good as 'Blue' and 'Red', it's about on par with 'White'), 'The Double Life of Veronique' is at its best mesmerising. It is somewhat slight narratively, not as thematically rich as for example 'Red' and Weronika is a slightly more interesting character than Veronique, with a slightly longer length Veronique could have had a little more development than she did.This is in no way denouncing 'The Double Life of Veronique's' quality, because so much works. It is stunning visually, the very stylised but often gorgeously jaw-dropping cinematography is innovative in its use of colour and camera filters to enhance the ethereal atmosphere created. The music is every bit as hauntingly intricate and symbolic as the score in 'Three Colours: Blue', and is like a fascinating major character in itself, the use of it is inspired too.Kieslowski's direction is assured, thought-provoking and unobtrusive, his style is distinctive and unmistakable and there are many great visual and dramatic touches that help keep the viewer fascinated. The film is very intelligently and poetically written, while the story makes the most of its ingenious concept through heavy but thought-provoking if initially perplexing use of symbolism and an atmosphere that's ethereal, hypnotic, poetic and haunting. There are many powerful and moving moments here.Irene Jacob mesmerises in her luminously sensitive dual performance, where she shows great emotional range with two completely contrasting characters. Her Best Actress award at Cannes was more than richly deserved.Overall, slight but intelligent, beautiful and mesmerising, the cinematography, music and Jacob being the three main reasons for seeing it. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A hauntingly beautiful experience...,"i will openly admit that i really didn't know what to think when the closing credits started to roll on krysztof kieslowski's the double life of veronique. this is a gorgeously-shot, completely immersive film that unapologetically leaves the viewer with many unanswered questions.the storyline follows two women, played by the same actress, who share a mysterious mental and emotional connection, despite having never met. the most apparent aspect of their subconscious connection is that veronique, the young french woman, seems to make decisions based on the parallel experiences of her polish counterpart, weronika, without consciously knowing why. the first act of the film follows weronika almost exclusively as she begins her singing career. After a dramatic and significant event in weronika's life, the film turns to veronique for the final two acts, focusing primarily on her uniquely developing romantic relationship with a children's author.the double life of veronique is so rich and densely-woven that i found myself getting lost in all of the sensory and thematic layers. the cinematography is striking, with many memorable shots exhibiting a surreal and beautifully disorienting quality. the camera exposes a number of fascinating visual motifs as the film progresses - windows, reflections, and certain color associations, just to name a few. music plays a signficant role as well in the surreal connection between weronika and veronique. many musical cues throughout the film provide potential clues in unlocking the mystery of this film's meaning.and it is, most definitely, a mystery - at least it is to me after seeing the film only once. kieslowski is known for creating films that ask questions, rather than make statements and the double life of veronique is no exception. (in fact, it is perhaps the strongest example). he gives the viewer so much to process in this film and yet maintains almost complete ambiguity, leaving it open to any number of interpretations. as i continue to ponder and even revisit the film, i'm sure that my own interpretations will begin to take shape. in the meantime, i am haunted by its questions and anxious to sink back into the double life of veronique.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

The story is not half as strong as his last films, and it goes beyond subliminal and criptic.

Ms. Jacob's performance was excellent, and I can understand why it won her a Cannes prize. The music feels ethereal. The cinematography, while splendid in its own right, relies much, much to heavily on a dark palette/sepia tone, which only serves to highlight the dullness of the movie.I think the problem is in the script. As presented, it could have been made into a short much more effectively than a feature. I agree with other reviewers who lament that too little time was spent developing the story of the Polish woman and too much of the French woman. I will concede that while the plotline itself is nothing innovative, it was still a cool idea.The marionette sequence at the beginning of the film was mesmerizing, at least to me. The nudity felt thrown in just to give it an R rating.

Old Polish Veronique dies and new French Veronique lives on. It has themes of inevitability of aging, absurdity of sudden death and absurdity of life itself.

Stick it back in the oven. It ain't done yet.,"I'm a big fan of Kieslowski's work, but I'm not blind to the fact that even the masters can churn out an occasional dud. This is like Kieslowski's unfinished symphony. It had the most promising storyline of all his efforts, but he went nowhere with it. Rather than developing what could have been a real mindbender, he chose to focus on symbolism, mood and camera technique.Film school students should love this flick. He does tons of wacky things like filming through a glass ball, through a man's spectacles (twice), through a distorted train window and, of course, using the trademark Kieslowksi microscopic close up on a cup of tea (ok, in ""Blue"" it was a cup of coffee, and in Dekalog 2 it was a glass of water...same friggin thing). But to people who don't go ga-ga over that sort of stuff--to people who are searching for good old fashioned literary substance--this'll be a somewhat aggravating experience.If you like impressionistic movies like Fellini's AMACORD or Tarkovsky's ZERKALO, then you'll probably love this film. But if you prefer the clearly-defined work of Kurosawa, Bresson or Kubrick, then I'd advise you to pass on this and check out Kieslowski's other works instead. Try the Three Colours trilogy & the Dekalog series...between those, there's 15 hours of good, classic Kieslowski to pique your brain.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

",,Not long ago, I had a strange sensation. I felt that I was alone. All of a sudden. Yet nothing had changed.''","I don't exactly know how I could describe this movie to a friend. I can't describe it even to myself. But if I'm ever going to assign the word ''transcendent'' on a movie, this would be one of the best candidates.I think I can't explain it because it isn't meant to be explained. It is meant to be FELT and artistically appreciated. Of course, you can also ponder about the depth of some of the lines but it's very difficult to find an objective meaning or message to the movie as a whole. Sentiment and mood is what Krzysztof Kieslowski really masters here. It's almost surrealist in its approach but with some dots that connect so we can still have a satisfying story for the movie to play on. It partially reminds me of ''Un Chien Andalou'' , especially when Veronique pretends to cut her eye with a ring, just like in the beginning of Luis Bunuel's movie.The sick, strange or surreal green that enwraps nearly every shot is one of the best I have seen, comparable to The Matrix (1999). And it makes me feel like I'm in some sort of dream, a gloomy but not nightmarish dream, but meanwhile it also creates complementarity through adding red in the shots.Till I figure out more about the movie, it has any score between:An 8,7 - 9,4 from me.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Brilliant!,"A few spoilery bits throughout!Just like a constellation you're unable to decipher yet sure its stars are linked together to form a certain pattern, the lives of Weronika and Véronique are inextricably, and inexplicably, linked by an invisible thread only intuitively felt. The former lives in Poland while the latter in France, they were born on the same day, share a knack for music (Weronika is a choir singer with an ethereal, angelic voice; Véronique is a music teacher), and suffer from a cardiological problem. They're, in a mythological sense of the word, doppelgängers, who'd better live in two parallel worlds lest bumping into each other would result in putting one another's lives into a tailspin. In one sense, the film is about that person in your dreams who you think, besides looking exactly like you, complements you in ways beyond your capacity even if you're sharing the same affinities as well. A splitting image you'd easily mistake for your other half even though you're pretty much a whole. Someone you long to meet to be fulfilled, and when awake, you grieve for the implausibility of it all. And I think it's within this realm where the movie operates on a subconscious level so that you're effortlessly connected emotionally with it by merely letting yourself immersed in its sepia-drenched images and its downpour to wash over you. However, I wouldn't buy that description at all. In another sense, it's a film about discovering one's own identity. Insofar this seems a proper description that I can't refute, I still think this is just scratching the surface; focusing on obvious details and disregarding the overarching theme. For me, The Double Life of Véronique is about grieving for your younger, juvenile self despite the naivety that led to its demise; about a deep-seated longing for the past that grows on while growing old even though you're more mature and successful now than you were way back when. And this is exactly where the film manages to hit some nostalgic notes, for the film seems to celebrate that desperate longing in one way or another. Besides the puppets show I'll mention later, there's a scene that sums up all this in a few words: Véronique's father shows her a fragrance to try it, she tells him it's nice but the one he showed her the other day was more pleasant. ""This is from the end of Autumn, the other was from the beginning,"" is her father's reply, which he follows by wondering whether people would need this fragrance at all. The movie is chockablock with subtle visual and narrative details carry multi-layered symbolic significance that I couldn't get my head around in my first watch.The Double Life of Véronique is an enigmatic metaphysical tale with an expressionistic set design and cinematography littered with subtleties functioning as an objective correlative, stressing every emotional beat along the way. There's a lot of reflections in The Double Life of Véronique and the look-alike characters see themselves, or rather sense each other, in many things: images; objects. Throughout the first half, we see recurring distortions, upside-down images and mirror-like reflections, some show convexity and others concavity. We see plenty of objects such as a tram window glass, a man's magnifying spectacles, and a starry marble. They're all suggestive of something wrong rippling Weronika's life and irking her of late while bringing her fears of not being ""alone in this world"" to the fore. Besides, there are many juxtapository images the editing mix in that accentuate the dual nature at the core of the film. Indeed It's a film where objects and images hold immense value to the characters but also work as clues of revealing significance, and expository tools to the viewer as well. It's not until the marionette show where I started to fathom the film through the ""metamorphosis by death"" metaphor. The shroud is a cocoon? No wonder why there's a shot from the point of view of a corpse! Through this scene, Kieslowski makes a parallel to Véronique's double life, indicating that with the death of Weronika, Véronique began a fully-fledged new life. Moreover, by letting the camera linger on Jacob's face, Kieslowski captures the intensity of her internal conflict, and by ending the dizzying fits of Weronika with an off-kilter, tilted angle, we collapse with her. Thus, the camera is both a guiding force and a participant in Weronika's crumpling life and Veronique's quest of love and working out her existential issues. The Double Life of Véronique is just a flawless harmony or a poetic mood piece, buoyed by Idziak's ravishing cinematography, Preisner's haunting score, and sees Irène Jacob - in one of the most riveting performances I've ever seen to date - emoting endless feelings across the film's fleeting runtime, taking you on a rollercoaster of emotions from start to finish.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
More than cinema: pure poetry,"There is something magic about Kieslowski 's cinema: his ability to expose the beauty and complexity of the human soul on celluloid print.
This is perhaps his most intimate and touching movie, an authentic classic masterpiece.
The double life of Veronique tells the story of two identical women living separate lifes in Poland and France. The furtive encounter between Weronica and Veronique triggers a meditation on life, destiny and the pursuit of love. 
Love scenes are shot with unique sensuality and delicacy (at times through a magnifying glass). No other director has been able to capture the essence and fragility of women the way Kieslowski does it here - with her etheral beautiful muse Irène Jacob.
This film will fill your soul and mind like very few others.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not the greatest, but still very good","I know that this film is considered to be the highest achievement of Kislowski, and yet I have to admit that this is not so. The idea is neat - there are two ladies, Weronika in Poland and Veronique in France, both played by excellent Irene Jacob, they meet only once and still just see each other in Krakow during the anti-Communist strike of 1990. Weronika the Pole is a great opera style singer, though she never studied this seriously before, she misses her Mom and comes to Krakow to her drinking Auntie. There, she gets attention and accepts the invitation to sing in serious concerts. But she is deadly ill and dies suddenly during her debut. Veronique lives in France, she is a teacher, she is quite happy with her love life, her relatives and her hobbies. Anyway, this is where the extreme boredom creeps in, while you are through the French part of the film. I am sorry for all those who love the film, but the excellent tempo and impeccable style start to evaporate at about last 40 minutes of the film, and then you only plead yourself to watch it till the end. Good film indeed, all made in honey yellow amber color tones and full of sudden and subtle details - creeping old grannies, shambles on the background and peeling walls. Cool and deep work.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Has a Hypnotic effect!,"The Double Life of Véronique, a poetic masterpiece. This is a film which compels you to read about it more than the time you have watched it for. Krzysztof Kieślowski has made love to the silver screen. The magical use of Red, Green & Golden has taken cinematography to an altogether new level. The awe inspiring music by Zbigniew Preisner, that surely lifts the mood. And finally the most beautiful thing to ever happen to cinema, Irène Jacob. Though the film doesn't have a story that can be put on paper yet it has a hypnotic effect. Can't believe it was made 22 years ago. Those who love real cinema & want to celebrate emotions are in for a treat.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A unique experience,"So i was very interested in seeing this movie, what first made me interested in seeing the movie was the fact that it was directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski, the director of the well known Three Color: Trilogy, which i really like, i had also seen another movie of his,A Short Film About Love, so i had liked what i had seen from him, certainly not mainstream stuff, but very interesting work. Another reason was the fact that this was his first collaboration with Irène Jacob who later appeared in his masterpiece Three Colors: Red. So yeah i wanted to see their first collaboration. My expectations i would say were not big, because i had heard that many people did not get the movie, but i hoped for the best.The Double Life of Veronique is directed and written by Krzysztof Kieslowski and it stars Irène Jacob, Wladyslaw Kowalski and Halina Gryglaszewska. And i got to say that my biggest fear has come true, because i cant understand not in a whole what this movie is about. The movie follows two identical Veroniques, born on the same day - one Polish, one French, both with an identical heart condition and the same great operatic singing voice,both look like each other, they are like separated twins.We never really truly understand the connection between the two Veronique's they both look the same, the same thing is happening to both, and they feel something that they cant describe, they never feel alone, they always in a way feel each other.Its weird because i cant say that i disliked the movie, and i don't understand much of what happens, at times i felt like i was under a spell, very weird felling, some scenes are almost hypnotizing. Because of Kieslowski visual beauty, the yellows and oranges on screen perfect, but also because of Irène Jacob, she is amazing. The luminous Irène Jacob does wonders with her difficult double role as Veronika/Véronique, which requires her presence in nearly every frame of film. Guided by the sure hand of Kieslowski, Jacob projects an authentic goodness and innocence, coupled with a palpable sensuality and sensitivity. And this seems effortless. And to think that Andie MacDowell was almost cast to be in the movie, No way she would had been as great as Irène.While watching it i was amazed by the visual beauty that once again Kieslowski managed to put on screen, by the charming star that Irène Jacob is on screen, but after the movie ended, the movie left me with questions lots of them, it left me confused.I think Kieslowski wanted us to end the puzzle by ourselves the thing is that he doesn't give enough pieces, maybe the puzzle just cant be done, and in film i like to finish my puzzle.

Reflections from the looking glass,"Here's a kind of movie that helps you think outside the proverbial box: Meet Véronique, the French protagonist who chances upon a most unusual face - en passant, in a fleeting moment, like a reminder from another life. The face of the person she sees is her own. Somewhere on a Polish plaza, to briefly surface and drown again in the crowd. ""La Double vie de Véronique"" teaches you to appreciate escaping the comfort zone of trusted logic, recognize its pitfalls and see a strange, maybe even absurd fantastic premise in an otherwise realistic picture as a chance to discover something that cannot be named. Sure, Kieslowski pictures are always a combination of beautiful images, evocative music and a strong cerebral component, but ""La double vie de Véronique"" is his most enigmatic, thought provoking work. Various threads are spun by writer and director which appeal to the viewer's imagination, so that they may be connected or respected just the way they are. Or perhaps seen as a whole in the eye of the beholder in front of the screen: Two different lives, one face, strings attached or mere coincidence? Is there fate? Does the demiurge work as puppeteer or are our actions influencing others in a way we would never anticipate? There are no metaphors in my work, Kiesloswki once said. Sounds challenging? Feel free to connect your own dots in this magical adventure of parallelism seen through the looking glass!Just one thing: The purpose of art is not to provide answers and be prescriptive in its implications, be they moral, social, historic or otherwise, but rather to open up new pathways and perspectives and question what we've been used to take for granted. In this respect Kieslowski succeeds indubitably and delivers a dazzling work of art to be looked at. Again and again.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Symbolizing the identity crisis of Kieslowksi?,"""La double vie de Véronique"" is a film with a hard to follow storyline. It is about two women (Weronika in Poland and Véronique in France) that have more in common than only their names and their appearances (both characters are played by Irene Jacobs).It remains vague what this ""more"" precisely is. The two women seems to be aware of each other, without direct contact. During a vacation of the French Véronigue in Poland there is a moment that they are physically close, but pass each other unnoticed.Some will say the ""more"" is something of a shared soul, others will say it is more a shared fate or predestination. In favor of the last interpretation is the fact that both Weronika and Véronique have problems with their hearts. In the second half of the film there is also a puppetmaker who produces two puppet versions of Véronique, suggesting that somewhere above there must also be a puppeteer.My personal interpretation is that the film reflects most of all an identity crisis on the part of director Krzysztof Kieslowksi (1941 - 1996). ""La double vie de Véronique"" was his first film outside Poland in his new homeland France. He would live in France until his untimely death in 1996.The death of Kieslowski was a loss to all lovers of cinema, but was I think especially harmful for the career of Irene Jacobs. After a small role in ""Au revoir les enfants"" (1987, Louis Malle) she played leading roles in the Kieslowski films ""La double vie de Véronique"" (1991) and ""Trois couleurs: rouge"" (1994). After the death of Kieslowski the rising curve in her career more or less came to a halt.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
New narrative -boring narrative,"Most of all I like stories, I might be attracted by more poetic movies but it has to be grabbing me from the first second to the last. Unfortunately, I was really disappointed about that ""non-story"", probably of ""new narrative"" with no traditional dramatic structure. The result is boring. Moreover, very weak points kill some of the moment: unlikely situations, the clichés: he is a famous writer with 10 books, she receives anonymous letters, a guy in the staircases coming out of the blue, poor actors in the second roles (the two colleagues or friends), a flasher in the street,...and that constant yellow filter on all images...I had to run out of the movie theater for some fresh air.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
bitter poetry,"In essence, nothing new. The traits of story are familiar. The performance of Irene Jacob - not surprising. The mix of two lives , from two countries, so simmilary and different and one as part of the other are , in same measure, reminds of the art of Kieslowski. Special , except the story telling - the feeling to be a story about their viewers. You are witness of gestures and words and discovers, front to the two dolls. The fate and the life as embroidery. The bitter poetry and its traces. The eulogy of freedom and exploration of the sides of captivity. A magnificent film. About a long and fragile fall.",,Anonymous,Music
A very sophisticated commentary,"A very beautiful, if somewhat confusing, film. A lot of the people commenting here have already said it, but I will repeat it anyway: Irene Jacob does a fantastic job in this film in terms of acting, and she's angelically beautiful too. Although there is very little dialogue, she conveys a huge amount to the audience - another example of Kieslowski's genius for visual narrative. Her performance, combined with the fantastic cinematography, shot composition and selection, and music, make this film a treasure to behold. Virtually every single frame of this film would look amazing if you blew it up and hung it on your wall in a picture frame, and I bet that if you sat blindfold in your living room while the film played, you would have a pretty amazing experience as well. The storyline of the film was admittedly fractured and vague a lot of the time, but sitting here a couple of hours after watching it, things are starting to click in my head. The Polish part was fine in terms of narrative, very engaging. Then we cross over to France, and we are shown a lot of tiny snippets of Veronique's life, which we immediately try to start piecing together to form a story. None of these snippets ever join together to form something concrete... this is Veronique's lostness and confusion as she searches for something to fill the void left by Veronika. At least that's what I think. There are still parts I don't understand, such as what exactly happened outside the cafe where she meets the puppeteer, and what happens at the end of the film when Veronique touches the bark of a tree and we see her father inside the house. Strange. Maybe I will understand more when I see the film again, which I certainly will - but probably best to wait at least 6 months. The only gripe I have with the film is that it seemed a bit drawn out and boring about 3/4 of the way through, when very little was happening... but I have to forgive Kieslowski this because a film this great doesn't come along very often.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Finding New Life, and New Love, After a Loss","Identical women, born on the same day to different corners of Europe, subconsciously influence each other's lives. Though they never meet - only a brief sighting from across a crowded town square - their shared extra-sensory connection is deep and profound. Doubly so when one suddenly collapses and dies during a choral performance. Across the miles, a drastic mood swing shows us that the other is immediately aware of her loss. After experiencing that moment of heavy, inexplicable grief, she develops a newfound appreciation for life's little delights and a fresh attraction to love.Though its plot may be limited and often confusing, there's something intrinsically attractive and alluring at play here. The film's technical warmth and rich visual tones deserve recognition, but I think its star is the real reason everything comes together. Irène Jacob plays both characters, on-screen for nearly the entire running time, and displays a rare degree of cinematic magnetism. A quiet and understated actress, she single-handedly carries the story's weight, conveying complicated emotions with subtlety and nuance. And it doesn't hurt that she's a certifiable knockout, effortlessly gorgeous in even the most mundane of acts.A critically imperfect, but emotionally entrancing, mix of sights and senses.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Uninspired movie,"My least favorite of the Kieslowski movies ive seen. It follows the same eerily mystical narrative style that his other films do, but this one seems off. The story (if a story at all) lacks a point of view or a stance or anything of substance unfortunately. The movie itself is filmed beautifully and well scored but has nothing else going for it, in my opinion. This is simply because the story wasnt there, the character had nothing to offer as connectivity and it was detrimental to the presentation of the story (again, if any).",6.0,Anonymous,Music

pretentious artiness,"Every Sunday my wife and I watch a film that is a little out of the mainstream for us. We have seen some good ones like ""The Secret in Their Eyes, ""Other Peoples Lives"" and ""A very long Engagement"". We had never seen a Krzysztof Kieslowski film and were very much looking forward to it. What a tremendous disappointment. We found almost nothing to like.The story line was weak and confusing. The entire atmosphere of the film was contrived and phony artiness. We almost turned it off several times but toughed it out to the bitter end hoping it would get better. When it was finally over we checked user ratings and noted it is most popular with ""under 18 year old males"" and we suspect this might be because what we have is soft-core pornography posing as art.

The only way I could relate is by recalling my own feeling of ""Deja Vu"", which is so fleeing that I suppose only French could give it a name.I don't know how much Ms. Jacob's acting benefited from Kieslowski's directing, but result is a joy to watch.

An artistic masterpiece,"Any true cinéaste is not obliged to overlook this masterwork. Although Kieslowski is a highly skilled director with a respectable list of great films on his resume, this is my favorite of his oeuvres.The photo is fantastic. Every shot could have been disassembled and put up in a photo exhibition. The music is excellent. The story is a little diffuse in an interesting way and very rich in its scope for interpretation. Actually the film is so much broader than just confined to a single story. And this is like life; life is not always as grandiose as we think or wish it to be, but the simple things can be beautiful. It covers many small things in life, and like Kieslowski's other films, the approach is steady yet light-handed, relaxed. It is poetic, it is about love, about life, about mysteries.It is a tragedy to not take advantage of an opportunity that comes into one's way, maybe once in a life time - and we suffer regret. Iréne Jacob has similarities to Juliette Binoche, probably Kieslowski's type of ideal woman: independent and beautiful. Like for example Binoche in the Blue film of the Dekalog, the women in his films have adopted to loneliness. But they cannot handle it completely - nobody can.In the end, it is sense of utter satisfaction to have completed this film that does not disappoint on any single point. It leaves me with yet stronger motivation to learn French - to be able to see this masterpiece without subtitles.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Clever Concept,"Two parallel stories about two identical women; one living in Poland, the other in France.

But this film is one example of the great things that can come out of Poland.The very concept is interesting.

A Gift Of Cinema,"A festival of subtlest emotions; a gentle dive into innermost depths of soul's yearnings; a magical gaze into invisible and intuitive. Glimpses of eternity; life, death, mystique, spirituality, romance, art; darkness, light, reflections, shadows; echos, silence, music. A slight brush of the flapping of the soul's invisible wings; a glance at the spirit's fine and delicate contours; a peek at its mystical, miraculous and metaphysical silhouette.Sublime cinema!The Double Life Of Véronique is the creative pinnacle of Kieslowski's otherwise extraordinary rich career. This majestic film is a festive celebration of the wizardry of unrestrained, ingenious film-making, a showcase for singular quality of cinema as a collaborative art form. The film's steady, always radiant yet subtle energy, is a magic flow of transcendental forces, a wide river which makes artificial boundaries between two countries, Poland and France - between Weronica and Véronique - irrelevant and obsolete.Véronique opens with an exterior shot of a Polish choir girl; her gaze lifted towards heavens, her angelic voice soaring as the spring downpour disperses the rest of the choir girls. A living angel singing an ode to the creator, a gifted girl celebrating the majesty of living. That's what artists are put on Earth to do - aspire to heavens.La Double Vie De Véronique is a reflection of Kieslowskie's deep artistic longings, a mirror reflecting his most intimate film aspirations. The film was made during the crucial time in his life, the time of revolutionary upheaval - the lifting of the iron curtain; the time, also, of his moving to France from his native Poland.The character of Polish Weronika and her mirror image, French Véronique, are composites of the artist's soul, the embodiment of his artistic strivings.Supremely gifted with angelic soprano, Weronika is the artist's Polish alter ego. Her heart condition is a poetic metaphor of the fractured soul of an artist behind the iron curtain witnessing the collapse of the old world. Weronika's final demise is symbolic of the passing of an era and Kieslowski's eventual leaving his native Poland.There has always been a dynamic duality within hearts and souls of eastern European artists. Constrained by the rigor and dogma of the totalitarian ideology, the artist's domestic roots and artistic inspirations were in constant conflict with the longing for the western freedom of expression and unrestrained creativity.Véronique, a music teacher, is Weronika's body-double and, symbolically, Kieslowski's French incarnation. She is introduced in an erotic scene that surprisingly leaves the French copy of Polish Weronika saddened and melancholic. As the film moves from Poland-set first act to modern day Paris, we find Véronique feeling a strange sense of loss, a vague sensation that a part of her had mysteriously disappeared.In an early scene in Poland, Weronika takes a note of a passing truck hauling an upright statue of Lenin. It is the time of turmoil, the time of sweeping, historic changes taking place.The old Poland of the Kieslowskie's young, formative years is swept away by the course of history - forever gone. A heartfelt loss that an immigrant artist in a foreign country feels deeper than any other human being. Véronique's heart condition is symbolic of an uprooted artist's heartache - the pain for the things which a person leaving his country irrevocably looses. Véronique's search for the identity and whereabouts of her secret admirer through the maze of urbane Paris, is a primal quest mirroring Kieslowskie's own search for artistic identity and recognition in the new, unknown, more challenging foreign terrain.The original soundtrack composed by master composer Zbigniew Prieznev compliments every aspect of the film to an extent that its haunting score becomes an integrated narrative element and its melodies turn into magical strings connecting the two women.Genre-defying, as many European movies are, the films effortlessly crosses various cinematic terrains. This is a genuine masterpiece that will forever remain the finest achievement of the late 20th century European cinema.On another level altogether, this majestic metaphysical thriller could be viewed as the first cinematic acknowledgment of the validity of the string theory of the universe.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Deep subtle but perplexing movie that lacks the punch,"Like the other Kieslowski films, the film do not offer much entertainment value but philosophical value. After listening to the audio commentary, I realize this is even more complicated film than I thought.I wasn't bored by it, but rather, perplexed. Knowing that it is Kieslowski film, instead tried to grab on to find its concept, I let the scenes express themselves as they are. I did have a haunting feeling through out the film, especially through the ""green or red"" dim mood coloring. It was intimate, yet mysterious surreal. Annette Insdorf's audio commentary of the Criterion Collection DVD did point out many connecting details and thoughts that did not revealed to me in my first viewing.After some more thoughts, I started to think that this movie really did fail to hold the audience in 2 ways:1) Krzysztof Kieslowski: Although this movie is deeper than the eyes can see, it is even less entertaining movie than his others that I'd watched. The intrigue went as far as the movie title. After that all the clues are so obscured that without a guide, it is a total ""perplex"". He had put so much effort into placing clues that he neglected to keep his audience. Granted, his meticulousness I do appreciate. Appreciating is different from enjoying. Green mix red is not an appealing color either, unlike the captivating colors in the three color trilogy.2) Irene Jacob: She is truly one of the most beautiful actress in the last few decades. The movie showed the full array of her beauty and the glory of her curves, not to mention the full blown of her eroticism. However, I can't find her performance inspiring. This is an expressive movie, and it is essential that the leading character express convincingly, i.e. Irene Jacob alone by herself, which I did not find her successfully do although I have to say quite a load for her to carry playing 2 characters. A movie I think I can compare with is Wong Kar-Wai's ""In the Mood of Love"". That movie would have been totally dull if Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung did not have their a great performance which I thought they had. I did not think Irene Jacob was tremendous either in Red though much better performance that this one. I thought Krzysztof Kieslowski did made Red interesting. Maybe I found that Irene Jacob is an overrated actress (was she ever considered as a good actress?), or perhaps Kieslowski is not the right director for her.It doesn't take away my appreciation of the grandeur spiritual message that I found in this movie, nor will it stops me from further watching Kieslowski's other movies, not at all.

Awful,"Ok, so I'm not a Kieslowski fan (although I liked his Ten Commandments a lot): reader, be advised. But this must be the most boring film I've ever seen (and I've seen many).I swear I was well awake when I hit the play button of my VCR. One hour later I had to struggle to keep my eyes open; because, I thought, I will get the sense of this movie, sooner or later. That never came! I didn't feel anything for, or learn anything from, Veronika or Veronique, except that they are two girls played by the same actress. Where's the beauty of this all? The filtered photography? The pointless coincidences? The lost looks in Jacob's face? Nice actress, but I looked that lost many times and that didn't make a movie out of my bad day.You know people say ""I want my two hours back""? I thought it was an expression, but with this film I really felt that way. Better, I was honestly furious at the screenwriter and myself, for having been cheated.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
The simple message of Véronique,"Friends,I am not writing about the artistic valences in this film. In my opinion there is also a simple point Kieslowski intended to transmit. Think about this.In the end of the movie the French Véronique says something like this: ""She must die for making possible to me to live"". What is this? Well, the Polish Véronique symbolise Poland and the French one France.After the Second War Poland and the other East countries were sacrificed to live in communism just for countries from West Europe should continue to LIVE a normal life. It is simple. Opinions?Regards, George - former Est Europe citizen",,Anonymous,Music

This is the Most Artistic film that I ever watched.,"La double vies de Veronique is a Movie that I love; Irene Jacob's Performance was so beautiful, and She was so Sexy; I saw her Nipples too. The Movie was a story of two similar Girls, One is Weronika and Another Veronique, and I love these Movies and Film Ideas. Before Three Color Trilogy, this was the first film that Kieslowski worked with Jacob, and they collaborated again in Three Color: Red. That made her well-known around the world. I know that some people don't like this movie, but I love It, telling the story of two people who were the same but of a different nationality. The Film story was so good with a Mixed of Magical Realism and a Legacy of the Cold War era, making this movie become an Iconic Movie, and this film made Irene Jacob win her best actress at the 1991 Cannes Films Festival.

Hypnotizing,"A mystifying, passionate, intangible experience that conjures emotions within me that went undiscovered prior to my first viewing. Keislowski was a singular presence in the film world and his absence can be felt more and more with each passing day. The scope of his talents and connection to human empathy and expression cannot be overstated. His Three Colors Trilogy is rightly lauded as his supreme achievement, but I've never been able to shake The Double Life of Veronique. Pure movieness at it's most serene and romantic, lead by the exquisite specter of Irène Jacob. She plays two identical strangers who share a mysterious bond. What unfolds is an ethereal, achingly beautiful musing on the nature of identity and intuition. Deeply moving with an effortless elegance that must be felt to be believed, it's one of the great triumphs of 1990's world cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

beautiful more films like this,"One of Krzysztof Kieslowski's finest films also called La Double vie de Vï¿½ronique. A philosophical, arty film its also subtle, full of Kieslowski's directorial magic, and gives the lead actress her most challenging role. There are two women, the Polish Veronika and the French Veronique ( Irine Jacob). They do not know that the other exists. They share the same losses and the same health. Weronika is a singer, and Veronique is taking singing lessons. But their lives and souls are bound together, and their personalities are yin-yang opposites, one practical and one a stargazer. Each has the strange feeling that she is not alone in the world. When Veronika dies onstage while singing, suddenly in France, Veronique is stricken with a strange feeling. Although Veronika has died, but she still lives and inhabits Veronika. She explores, searching for the truth about her double life, and meets a strange puppeteer who somehow is a link between both girls.This film demands to be analyzed. Is it about being puppets in some enormous scheme of things? Like Descatres 'Demon Hypothesis'. Or about fate? Sacrifice, Love, a soul in two bodies? Political symbolism? Or is it simply about some mysterious dimension of the spiritual? The symbols can be interpreted in various ways successfully and more ambiguously is the end happy or sad? Krzysztof Kieslowski's direction uses light and shadow, and the atmospheric music, make ""Double Life"" a work of art. Metaphors about the inner states of the characters include: the stars and leaves, are the personalities of Weronika and Veronique one a dreamer, one down-to-earth. Kieslowski also used a minimalist approach to dialogue, often using pauses and silence that speak louder than the ordinary words.This bewitching tale of love, loss, and interconnected souls winds a spell around this film. Interpretion can be argued over endlessly. An exquisite jewel. A work for a gallery.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

The interpretation of Irène Jacob who played as Weronika / Véronique was simply amazing and I believe that she made the difference in this movie.

"interesting, and quite prophetic","The Double Life of Veronique is not Kieslowski's best, but it's an interesting piece of work.  The lighting is invariably beautiful, shot in sepia tones which mirror Tarkovsky.  Of greatest interest, though, is its influence on 'Amelie'.  The theme of a young girl drawn inexorably towards her destined lover, achieved through a series of bizarre, improbably (indeed, supernatural) events is present in both and there are similarities in appearance and personality between Irene Jacob here and Audrey Tautou in Amelie.Maybe this is far-fetched, but I also detected what might be a precursor to Spike Jonze's films (scripted by Charlie Kaufman).  'Being John Malkovich', along with 'The Double Life..' carries puppetry as a central analagous idea, both films featuring puppets of the main characters.  Also, the notion of one of the main characters writing the story of the film within the film (which we see in 'the Double Life...') is obviously the central premise of 'Adaptation'.'The Double Life of Veronique' is therefore definitely worth a look considering that 'Amelie', 'Being John Malkovich' and 'Adaptation' all seem to borrow heavily from it.",,Anonymous,Music
Split Individuality,"""La double vie de Véronique"" by Krzysztof Kiewlowski shows in a most remarkable way how a person can be split in two individuals  Weronica who lives in Poland and Véronique who lives in France. According to classical Aristotelian logic, however, an individual is bound by place, time and body. Nobody can show up in the same body in two different places and/or at two different times, but a look at several mythologies shows that this concept of individuality is nothing but our heritage from ancient Greek thinking. Logic and metaphysics that form the fundamental of our sciences but also of our daily perception are Aristotelian as well. According to Celtic logic, for example, a two- or tripartite individual causes no problems at all, since here the spatial and temporal axes do not go into the definition of the individual.In order to treat multi-partite individuality, it is thus necessary to abandon Aristotelian logic. Since Celtic mythology (as mythology in general) cannot be formalized like Aristotelian logic, one must understand that time- and space-bounding of individuality in classical thinking causes mono-contexturality, i.e. an abyss between two persons as big as the abyss between the Here and the Beyond. On the other side, a poly-contextural notion of individuality allows the exchange between individuals. Already in a three-valued poly-contextural logic, the question arises if Death means the loss of individuality as it does in a two-valued mono-contextural logic. It seems to be merely a decrease of matter, but not of mind. So, when Weronica dies in Poland, she is able to survive as Véronique in Paris. It is remarkable that this kind of ""doppelganger"" shown in Kieslowski's movie does not belong to the frightening ones. In the opposite, since our perception of this world is not a two-valued ""light-switch"" system but colorful, so also the logic on which our perception is based should not be a yes-no logic but allow more values outside of this mono-contextural dichotomy.While only very few people accept that two-valued logic is long outdated  although already Heisenberg's detection that subject and object cannot be differentiated anymore on the level of high energy physics proves that this logic is fragmentary -, it is amazing that poly-contextural moments show up so often in movies. Very seldom, however, this has been presented in such an intriguing manner as in ""La double vie de Véronique"". Since science fiction in literature has announced the various developments of computer technology such as robots or cyber space, it is possible that up to now still fictional elements of our thinking are now announced by film that precedes the future change in our perception and its logical and metaphysical bases to which belongs without doubt also the abandoning of the mistaken Greek concept of individuality.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
The Double Life of Veronique,"This film tells the story of two young women; Weronika and Véronique. Weronika is Polish and Véronique is French; their names aren't the only thing they have in common; both are musical and have had similar experiences in life... and they look identical.In the early part of the film we follow Weronika as she visits her aunt in Kraków. Here she auditions for a part in a concert. Later as she walks across a town square during a demonstration she sees a French tourist who looks just like her. Shortly afterwards the action moves to Paris and that French tourist, Véronique, takes centre stage.There is something strangely hypnotic about this film; at times it has a dreamlike feel even though there is no suggestion that anything we see isn't happening to the characters. Similarly there is a haunting relationship between Weronika and Véronique even though they never really meet; there is just the brief moment when one sees the other in the town square. While each of their lives clearly effects the other somehow the film is about more than that as we as we see their loves and lives; joys and sorrows. Iréne Jacob, who is rarely off screen, is mesmerising in the dual roles of Weronika and Véronique. Director Krzysztof Kieslowski does a great job bringing the story to life and creating the amazing atmosphere. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody looking for something rather different.These comments are based on watching the film in Polish and French with English subtitles.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
The Double Life of Veronique - Krzysztof Kieslowski ( 1991 ),"....after I had seen this remarkable film, I expressed a thought to my companion to say that I think I may have unravelled the riddle of the story ....we were traveling on a tube train from a London cinema to a local pub to celebrate a friend's leaving party from work ....Throughout the film, I was intrigued -spellbound by the inventiveness of the motion picture; inspired to the haunting music; puzzled by the mysterious link to the puppeteer....there were striking images to enlighten my imagination -oozing in my taste for an art house filming......as I am writing, I am experiencing the deja vu feeling...I go back to my first thought after viewing the film: I recalled saying to my dear friend that if we picked-up on the story at middle ( -rather than at the beginning of the film, ) I would say that the tale of The Double Life of Veronique evolved here, from the puppeteer himself, who had written the very story in the first place!The Double Life of Veronique intrigues me to this day as it did a long time ago after that I had seen the film: And I still have a collective thought of collage images -but does it all make sense now in my kaleidoscopic memory of beautiful colours: I truly don't know?I have just telephoned my friend -the very lady who accompanied me to the cinema in the first place- we have reminisced in the magic and mystery of the film: 'Shall we meet again to see the film -on DVD- and who has a copy, me dear...''Krzysztof Kieslowski' writes, ""people are linked to each other by invisible threads....

Here is a quote from the film director, extended from my text above:""At a meeting just outside Paris, a fifteen-year-old girl came up to me and said that she'd been to see 'The double life of Véronique'. She'd gone once, twice, three times and only wanted to say one thing really - that she has realized that there is such a thing as a soul. She hadn't known before, but now she knew that the soul did exist. There's something very beautiful in that. It was worth making 'Véronique' for that girl. It was worth working for a year, sacrificing all that money, energy, time, patience, torturing yourself, killing yourself, taking thousands of decisions, so that one young girl in Paris should realize that there is such a thing as a soul. It's worth it.""

"I Liked It, But Could Use A Cheat Sheet","Irène Jacob is Weronika, a young Polish woman in Cracow. She has heart problems, wants to be a singer, and is falling in love with an ardent young man. She is also Véronique, a young French woman who has heart problems, wants to be a singer, and is falling in love with an ardent young man. They are not related. They have never met, although once the Polish woman saw the French woman get on a tour bus in Cracow, and the French woman snapped a picture with the Polish woman in it.I have no idea of what point director/co-writer Krzysztof Kieslowski is trying to make here. I take care to notice what colors dominate in his picture; here it is a dull, almost-cyan green, and orange. To me this suggest two-strip Technicolor and argues to these two women are complementary images of each other. There's also a marionette theme that suggests the controlling hand of fate.... or at least the film makers.What is clear is that there is some link between the two women that affects their moods. Perhaps Kieslowski is making some statement about the universality of some part of feminine nature. It's equally possible that he thought it was a nice way to link the way women fall in love in both countries. Whichever it is, the film making is compelling, and if the point is obscure to me, it may not be to someone else.... or perhaps it is deliberately obscure to excite the audience's interest.

The Fourth Color: Gold,"Krzysztof Kieslowski loves to delve in the idea of chance versus fate versus free will. The Double Life of Veronique is a haunting musical epiphany and with such visual poetry, it is filled with symbolism, some frank eroticism, and a slight dark humor. Kieslowski loves to filter colors to have an effect on his films, if it was part of his Three Colors Trilogy, it would've been ""Gold"". The photography was nostalgic, the lighting gives different shades on different moods of the characters. Irene Jacobs was enigmatic and sensual in her role as Weronika and Veronique. The story is simple, but there is more than the plot here, Kieslowski is more concerned in the visual rhyme, and his mystical narration of the story. He kind of connect the whole film together with strings but still leaves it like a scattered puzzle, it encourages uncertainty, and that is what I really liked about it. It leaves us with haunting questions that remains for us to answer, maybe in our own lives, rather than making us a complacent viewer that understands everything about the film and the world. I admire how Kieslowski made the film a reflection on the possibilities that the film indicates a reality beyond physical mundane lives. This film is both delicate and mysterious. I'd love to watch it again anytime, in a calmer and peaceful place with a cup of coffee at my hand.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"at times a confounding experience, but one I hope to revisit, for Irene Jacob and the direction","The Criterion DVD for The Double Life of Veronique includes many of the bells and whistles when it comes to special features, not to mention a long, in-depth interview with the director, Kieslowski. Maybe I'll watch that some time soon, but not right after watching this film. I could go looking for some easy answers - if there are any, which I doubt anyway - but I'd rather stay for now in a moment where I can just ponder everything I watched. It's such a rich and moving experience, and is one of the most unique mystery films I've seen in a very long time - possibly ever.In a way its chief mystery is what it's all about, which remains, possibly, elusive even to the end. Of course we have an idea of the concrete fact that there were two babies born on the same day in different countries, France and Poland, and they grew up to be beautiful young women with dark hair and brown eyes, and looked exactly the same. There's also a moment where the two see each other (one sees the other on a tour bus in Krakow, this in the midst of a protest/riot in the streets, and yet this other woman on the bus won't see her, at least not yet). Will they try to look for one another is a key question.But Kieslowski is so not interested in anything conventional here. The mystery is about discovering things, but not necessarily the deeper mystery of one knowing for sure the other exists; in other words, this isn't one of those double movies like, say, The Double (2014). We really get two stories here of these women, and they're full-on character portraits: the first half hour is dedicated to Weronique, the Polish woman, who is a professional singer (and former piano player) who has a heart condition. The rest of the film focuses on Veronique, who is a music teacher and, after seeing a puppet show performed by a charismatic man named Antoine (or is it Alexandre, one of those), he starts to... stalk her? Follow her in an intriguing way? Certainly he leaves clues for her to find, and when she does... then what?I'd like to make note for a moment music in the film. I don't think it's some flippant ""artsy"" choice on the filmmaker's part that each of these people are involved with music. Music is so central to the film, especially when Weronique is singing and becomes her most vulnerable, but also in those moments (on the flip-side image, so to speak) where Veronique isn't paying as close attention to the music she's teaching her students. Notice the opera that Weronique sings comes back more than once, like when Veronique is watching the marionette show. There is significance there, and it may be rooted back into that realm that music can lie with every person - like romance, which this film has, you can't always use the utmost logic ('the heart wants what it wants' so to speak) so why a music moves one person won't necessarily be the same for another. Why is music so paramount for Weronique, while for Veronique it doesn't seem so? Or, is music one of the things that connects them in that elusive, deep-deep down inside sense that they both have? Or maybe they're latent Jedis or something (I kid).How this is all filmed is completely absorbing; Kieslowski uses hand-held camera-work, but in a steady way that often creates tension, like when the two Veroniques are walking out in public (i.e., French side after she leaves her rendezvous with this not-so-mystery man and tries to go through crowded streets, and the Polish side after a rehearsal, where her heart becomes weak and she stumbles to catch her breath). How he uses color is especially breathtaking as well, and not always in ways that forces it but suggests things - red filters and bright whites and yellows here and there (not as blatant as the Colors trilogy, but maybe this was a practice round). So even when things get so enigmatic that it could, in just a few moments, become pretentious, Kieslowski reels it back in and makes the direction vital and important in ways that are unexpected. The camera itself is often another character, which is impressive.I've come all this way and haven't noted that without Irene Jacob this might all not work, or at least as well. There may be a moment here and there where it doesn't seem like she's doing much - she's so beautiful (on the cover I thought for a moment it was Ingrid Bergman with her eyes closed) that one might underestimate how deep and powerful she gets into both these women. The vulnerability is what's so staggering, and how much she feels the moments of joy and wonder, how her face registers genuine curiosity and in seeking out this mystery, and that crucial scene at the café when this Frenchman is revealed, notice how her face changes - it's subtle, but it's really there. I could watch Irene Jacob in this film or Red and see an actress so in tune with the character(s) that she in a way does half the work for Kieslowski. In other words, even when I was wondering, more than once, 'this storyline, such as it is, is getting a little weird and quixotic, maybe for its own good', she really grounded me in the emotional logic, and the pathos becomes so much that it makes something like a scene near the end this mix of heartbreak and bewilderment that I've rarely seen like this in a film.It's at times confounding, in certain choices and moments, but never in ways that might alienate; Kieslowski asks the audience 'come, a little closer - find out more about these women, and whatever the outcome, the journey is genuine and interesting.'",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A visually intriguing poignant poetic exploration of sympathetic resonance,"The entire film feels like a fractal painting bursting with emotions and liveliness , punctuated by a lingering background score and a warm colour pallet with occasional splashes of red.Synchronicity , humane connection, intuition, the duality along with the dichotomy of life forms the backbone of this masterpiece.In the present pop culture era obsessed and saturated with the parallel universes and multiverses, had to turn the clock 32 years back to feel a much needed breath of freshness.-I have a strange feeling. I feel like I'm not alone.-Not long ago, I had a strange sensation. I felt that I was alone. All of a sudden. Yet nothing had changed.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Magic and mystery,"There is a scene in the middle of this film that I think summarizes what Kieslowski is trying to say. The French Veronique is woken up by a blaze of focused light that dances like a will-of-the-wisp. She goes to the window to investigate and sees that the light is just a prank, created by a boy in the apartment across the street using a mirror to reflect and redirect the sunlight. When the boy realizes that he has been spotted, he retreats from his window. All an illusion, it seems--a cheap magic trick.Except when Veronique goes back to her room, she still sees a will-of-the-wisp, and it directs her attention to a folio of music that causes her to retrieve a shoelace that she had previously thrown away after receiving it mysteriously in the mail, which in turn is a connection to her doppelganger, the Polish Weronika. The film once again shows the apartment across the street. There is no boy, no mirror. This time, there is no magic trick--just a real mystery.This movie is about the strange connection between two women living in different countries who share many things in common and seemingly can sense each others' presence or absence even though they never meet. There is a love story involving Veronique and a puppeteer who is writing a children's story that parallels the Double Life of Veronique, and it is suggested that some of the odd coincidences that happen in the movie may be stage managed by the puppeteer. Some--but not all.We can see the puppeteer as a stand-in for Kieslowski himself--someone who creates illusions and enchantments that can surprise and move people but that are ultimately artificial. But the fact that we can be manipulated into being enchanted should not make us cynical--it should not blind us to the fact that there are real mysteries in life, chances and coincidences and harmonies that follow no logic that we can understand,.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
What else do you want to know about me?,"One does not have to get into the existential meaning behind this film to truly enjoy it.It concerns two women, Weronika and Véronique, both played by Irene Jacob (Three Colors: Red). They never quite meet, although their paths almost cross one day as Véronique is photographing a protest while leaving on a bus, and Weronika sees her - her double. One lives in France, and the other in Poland. They were born on the same day. They have the same heart problems. They are both superb singers. One dies, the other doesn't.The outstanding performance by Irène Jacob, who plays both Weronika and Véronique; the amazingly colorful cinematography by Oscar nominee (Black Hawk Down)Slawomir Idziak; and the absolutely sumptuous score by Golden Globe nominee (Three Colors: Blue, At Play in the Fields of the Lord) Zbigniew Preisner all make Oscar nominee (Three Colors: Red) Krzysztof Kieslowski's film the experience of a lifetime.But, to get the true measure of the film, you have to devote some time and effort in watching. It is not a passive exercise like some Hollywood shoot em up. It is a film with depth and meaning. It is spiritual, maybe even religious, and will have serious viewers finding something to discuss for a long time.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"Beautifully filmed, lyrical doodling that don't make a movie","This is a beautifully filmed movie, with music that conveys an extraordinary atmosphere of mystery and longing. One sees the wandering of the main characters in this sort of spiritual daze, and the movie lets us attempt to fill in its ""meaning"" with everything that appears  on screen.As beautiful as it is, I found it extremely tedious. I think the director could have put anything on screen and had the same reviewers leaping about for the meaning of the symbolism. (In fact, some reviewers simply have it wrong - e.g., although the puppeteer is initially shown as manipulative, within five minutes, the main character is saying that she's always loved him - it is she, not he, who empties the contents of her purse when he says he wishes to know all about her).The movie is like a poem with many beautiful images and no point - except the myriad of ""meanings"" that different readers will impart to it. One needn't like American movies to want a story - it's a pretty human desire. One wants a point in virtually all poetry as well - there's a thread that carries one stanza into the next - whether one's reading Shelley or Heine or Rilke, Gautier or even Verlaine. They want to tell us something - this movie sets up the premise and lets it drift like a cloud.There's a very Kafkaesque story-like feel to this movie. Yet in Kafka, the main character always seeks meaning - he is rational and is alternately cowed, defiant, driven in his attempts to find out the truth. Not so with our main characters here - they are aimless.As beautiful as this movie is, there's really no point to it. The movie asks a question ""what if...?"" and doesn't attempt to answer it. I can't say that I thought it was a waste of time - it's obviously lovely, care has clearly been taken - and it does create an atmosphere of fuzzy longing and cloudy beautiful mystery. But it's not enough.",,Anonymous,Music
"Dream, Grief, Politics in Kieslowski's Masterwork","I am stunned by this film: visually, by the genius of Kieslowski in every single detail of the frame; emotionally, with a story that hides more than it shows, yet telling us everything, as if it were a dream. The film has a unique structure: it goes from casualty to detail, from optimism to grief. But it is not casualty. Nothing in this film is casual, the cars, the crowds, the objects, the countries-nothing is.This film, in my view, has a very strong political subtext. The first had to burn her hand so that the second wouldn't. What couldn't be possible and achievable in Poland is in France. A very beautiful contrast regarding the portrayal of crowds: the Polish crowd, fleeing from the military, in an obvious state of rebellion; the French crowd, right after we switch setting at the end of Act I, children, playing in the school yard. The first had to experience doubt so that the second could love, in a beautiful silent climax. The first had to die so that the second could live.Besides the constant theme of dualism, with the protagonist trying to understand the origin of her grief and existential malaise, and the subtle, delicate but powerful performance by Irène Jacob, the film, I believe, reminds us that we cannot remain indifferent in front of the many tragedies of the world, inciting us to go find and discover the very true nature of the connection with our double, wherever he/she may be, knowing that death is necessary elsewhere so that the world could keep on living.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A movie that touches your mind and heart,"This movie is very good, a mesmerizing exploration of identity and existence, beautifully shot against the backdrop of Europe. The film follows two women, both named Veronique, who live parallel lives in Poland and France, connected through an unexplained spiritual bond. Irene Jacob's haunting performance as both Veroniques captivates, conveying a sense of longing and mystery that permeates the entire film. Kieslowski's direction, characterized by his trademark visual poetry and profound philosophical undercurrents, invites viewers to ponder the delicate threads that bind us to our own identities and to others. With its enigmatic storytelling and evocative cinematography, ""the Veroniques"" is a cinematic gem that lingers in the mind, offering a rich tapestry of emotions and ideas long after the credits roll.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
MYSTERIOUS REALISM,"Most of us will have heard the phrase ""Magical Realism"" most often applied to a form of literature but I think ""Mysterious Realism"" is more applicable to a director like Krzysztof Kieslowski who strives for a naturalistic realism. In his quest for this kind of realism, Kieslowski used to make documentaries but he doesn't make them anymore. He explained once that some things are too real and cannot be filmed so invasively and so now he prefers to make films about realistic characters by using everything fake because this is the only way to achieve the realism that he pursues. In the process, he hopes that everyone working on his films will bring something of themselves, something personal to them. THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE is about 2 identical women, one Veronika who is Polish and the other Veronique who is French. Somehow they feel each other's connection to the other even though they have never met. This is unlike any realistic premise hitherto seen in cinema (to my knowledge) and yet it reminds me of a work by that other great Polish director, Roman Polanski and his film THE TENANT. In THE TENANT, Polanski (directing himself as a Pole in Paris) moves into an apartment only to take on the character of the previous tenant, a woman. Early in Kieslowski's film, Veronika becomes aware of Veronique when she spots her getting on a tourist bus in Poland but it is not till much later in the film that Veronique becomes aware of Veronika. Veronika is a classical singer of rare talent and we find that Veronique takes singing lessons as well but because of her connection to Veronika decides to give up this pursuit for reasons she doesn't understand. And here we touch on one of the themes of Kieslowski's work which is how we go through life revealing little about who we really are (if we even know at all) because we are always trying to present ourselves as strong, without problems, without showing our emotions or our weaknesses. Kieslowski's earlier films, A SHORT FILM ABOUT KILLING and A SHORT FILM ABOUT LOVE (both of which are features extended from two of his 10-part television series, DECALOGUE) both touch on this theme but in THE DOUBLE LIFE OF VERONIQUE it becomes a major concern of the film, and even then, obliquely so. This is a film which comes to grip with difficult ideas about the nature of we as individuals acting and reacting upon each other. It is mysterious and also mystifying, demanding several viewings to let the images and its themes sink in to our minds as viewers, its characters reacting with us as well. It's a captivating film, never boring, often because of the beauty and skill of Irene Jacob in the dual lead roles though the other players are also extremely good. There is also some remarkable montage and mise en scenes throughout but that is part of Kieslowski's mastery of the medium as he is always hinting at something, trying to tell us something without being obvious. This film also preceded his incredible THREE COLOURS TRILOGY and is a wonderful precursor to them, and is every bit a masterpiece like BLUE, WHITE, and RED.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Surreal and Sentimental,"A movie about the double life of veronique. Its different but its connected at the same time. Like the name we pretty much dive in the two veronqiue's life. The story is very unique and creative. It might be slow but the appreciation it carries for all the artistic elements in it makes it so much more than it is. Without the right direction, It couldn't have shown the beauty of veronique's story. Story becomes so colorful and full of life. I also like how it create tension at random scenes.Acting was so sentimental and heartfelt. Irene jacobs is strikingly beautiful and her simplicity of conveying emotions without saying too many words is exactly why i love her. I think with the right premise and direction, she always nails the performance of her character. Thats exactly what she did in this movie. Absolutely nailed it. Like She so naturally blends in with the dynamic of colours making her look like an Angel.Cinematography of this movie just fits perfectly with the direction, making the scenes look both dreamlike and realistic. Everything feels so alive and simple at the same time. All of it goes very well along with story of veroniques. Music was unexpected(it was not the first thing in my mind but when it came i was suprised by how authentic they sounded). Music is classical orchestral which works very well for both the character and the movie. Like the even sound effects also deserve the appreciation for what they bring to the table.8/10, I liked the way it create references and the little details.Thank you for reading this :)",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Ethereal Irene Jacob,"The premise of this film is based on the old legend that we all have a twin somewhere in the world. Weronika is a Polish opera singer who while performing at an outdoor concert, continues to sing in a heavy rainstorm. Afterwards, she meets her boyfriend, Antek, and they get it on. She tells her father that she does not feel alone in the world. She visits her aunt in Krakow and meets a friend at a concert rehearsal. While listening, she sings along and the director is so impressed with her voice that he asks her to audition. While walking down a street during a protest rally, she notices a woman taking photos of the crowd. The lady looks like her twin. Her double gets on a bus which drives away.She passes the audition and the following night, and while singing a solo at a concert, collapses and dies on stage. Her spirit travels over the audience.That same day in Paris, Veronique(Irene Jacob), feels a great sadness for no apparent reason. Later, at her classroom, she leads her students in a classical piece by the same composer that Weronika was performing when she died.,Veronique falls in love with a puppeteer and writer named Alexandre and as the couple go through a photo album, he sees a picture which looks like her. Veronique explains that it can't possibly be her, since she took the photo. There is no real ending for Double Life, but Irene Jacob in the dual role, makes it work.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Evocative fantasy.....,"Irene Jacob carries her emotional burden lightly in a nuanced turn as the protagonist Veronique/Veronika. The sepia-toned fantasy film explores the idea of the soul of one trapped in another body. One life is influenced by the other as they look for fulfillment of their twin destinies, in music and love. Irene's face has that searching innocence which is used to good effect here. Kieslowski's direction utilizes those 'exalted silences' which are a hallmark of  European cinema. Irene's Best Actress Award at Cannes is well deserved.",,Anonymous,Music
Mesmerizing...,"I don't now how to start. Should i start with the music? Should I start with this red-haired angel Irene Jacob, oh god i think i love her. Or should i start with the cinematography and the direction by this genius ""gospodin"" Kieslowski? The film is brilliant, there's no doubt about it. It's mesmerizing and that's really something for me because i can't remember another film i've seen that i can use this word about or maybe just a couple and they are almost all by David Lynch. No, i don't compare this film to Lynch's but they have something in common. They all look like dreams.""La Double vie De Veronique"" is really like a dream to me. It looks like a dream, it features one of my dream girls, the story is not so important at all, just like in a dream, and it also features so many metaphors along the way. The whole film is as if taken from Kislowski subconsciousness and put on celluloid. Of course there's also a motif about duality, fatherhood but what struck you first is the overall atmosphere. The cinematography is excellent, here i go, i started with it, forgive me Irene. That's what makes the film so mesmerizing and really succumbs you in it. While i was watching, i really felt i wanted to be there, to live in this world, so melancholic and magical. And i also would like to be there because of Her.OK, i admit i've only seen two of her movies but that was enough. Irene Jacob is the greatest. I can't imagine how it is possible that she fell into mediocrity, or at least i heard so. But you know, i'm not that surprised either. She's not for everyone's taste. And of course i mean her acting abilities too. I heard some users think of her as just a ""pretty face"". Actually i don't think that's bad. Good film actors have to have charisma, a magnetic quality that attracts you in them so that you feel concerned and involved, i would love too see Glenn Close from the back rolls of the theater but not in a erotic thriller. And about the acting abilities - people see Al Pacino shouting at people and think that that's what is all about but it's not. Not all the people in the real world are so aggressive, passionate or so extrovert. Irene Jacob's acting is really very sublime and that's really hard. It's just that her heroine is that kind of person. I would really like to see more of her movies and to see her in new movies too. If not else she remains one of my favorites.And here comes the music. It's beautiful and it's really in the right mood with the film. I was even thinking at one point what if the film was based on the score and not the other way around. ""Gospodin"" Preiner is the man responsible. Well done is the least i can say. I'm trying really hard to find the music of the film. The scene with the concert and the subsequent death of Weronika is just so heartbreaking. By the way i like her better than Veronique. Yes, there is differences but you've got to find them by yourself. Or maybe just because she's a ""bratushka""(a Slav).",,Anonymous,Music

Don't watch the Demi Moore remake,"This beautiful, haunting and mysterious one of a kind movie is one of my favorites.

"A pessimistic film, somewhat negative and sad, about (maybe) two versions of the same person.","I decided to see this film shortly after having seen the trilogy of colors, by the same director, the Polish Krzysztof Kieslowski. The theme of the film is the lives of two women, the French Veronique and the Polish Weronika. They are doppelgängers for each other, live similar lives, have very similar aspirations and a similar life path. It could be said that they are twin sisters or versions of the same person! However, the two do not know each other and do not even presume the existence of the other. I dare not - and it would be very incorrect - to say more, but what happens to one of them affects the other in an inexplicable way. It is not, however, a happy or optimistic film.Kieslowski does an interesting job in a film that marks his expansion outside his country, into international cinema. Until then, he had only made a career in Poland, and largely at the expense of national television and documentaries. Color is fundamental in the film, as is the case in a good part of his work, and especially in his famous trilogy. Except that, contrary to what happens in these three films, the colors are largely muted here, through the almost permanent use of filters that reduce them to a tan, almost sepia. Thus, cinematography seeks to speak to us through color and framing, and ends up relating intimately and intensely with music and sound, creating an oneiric atmosphere that only seems excessive due to its omnipresence. Of the soundtrack, I would especially highlight a passage sung, in the best and most honest lyrical or operatic style, but undoubtedly composed for the film.The lead role (or rather, both lead roles) are secured by Irene Jacob, young and confident, sure of herself and her ability for the task at hand. This film opened doors for him and allowed him to have a much more distinguished career than he would have otherwise, I think. However, she is the only outstanding actress in this film. Everything else is supporting actors, appearing relatively fleetingly to do what needs to be done.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

That scene was magical to me, the puppets had so much emotion to them. More emotion than I've seen on some actor's faces. The way the puppeteer moved their hands was so delicate.  I thought the actor that played the puppeteer was intense and attractive. The rest of the movie was okay, and although I love ""artsy"" movies this one was too ""artsy"" for me.",,Anonymous,Music
"Well performed, but fails to deliver the message","This film stars Irene Jacob and is perhaps her best and most underrated performance. She had to tone down the expressions and mannerisms. And she really plays well with her eyes, a look that's at the same time innocent and curious.She could have done better by giving at least a touch of difference personalities to the characters apart from the hair style.The failure of the film is on the writer / director's part. It fails to deliver the message. Yes so the two personalities felt like they had a bond, but what about it.. Why make a film if you had nothing to speak about it if not to even explain it..

Disjointed and confusing,"Directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski and co-written with Krzysztof Piesiewicz, La double vie de Véronique thematically explores the concept of doubles, not as an externalization of the subject but as an identical other who is not part of their life and lives in a different city.Irène Jacob plays Weronika and Véronique, two identical women, one living in Poland and the other in France. Their similarities go beyond their appearance, for they both share the same career aspiration in music and seem to be connected by unexplainable feelings.Irène Jacob has a strong onscreen presence, and the movie offers artistic cinematography with interesting takes that make its protagonists point of view as well as the atmosphere of the cities feel as something special.
