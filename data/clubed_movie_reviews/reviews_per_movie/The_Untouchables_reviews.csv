"Al Capone's arrest, in a romanticized way.","This film takes place during the Prohibition, the golden age of American Mafia, and shows the difficulties that law enforcement ​​had to arrest Al Capone, Chicago's biggest mafia boss. Brian de Palma seems to have a powerful attraction for violence and the mafia, this being his second major film on the subject (the first, if I'm not mistaken, was ""Scarface""), but there is no doubt that his work was good and deserves congratulations. The story is told from the point of view of law enforcement, which is a novelty since most of the films that focus on Al Capone tend to show his life, or moments of his criminal course. This film shows him as the big villain he was and glorifies police officers, easily transforming Eliott Ness (played brilliantly by Kevin Costner in one of the most interesting works of his career) into a paladin of justice and law. Robert De Niro revisits his gangster movies (""The Godfather"", ""Goodfellas"" etc.) in a curious and comic interpretation of Al Capone, and Sean Connery plays a street policeman of Irish descent. In fact, it was precisely in this character that Connery got his only Oscar, despite all actors have fulfilled my expectations. The film is well constructed, looking to alternate epic action scenes (sometimes recalling in my mind the glory of cavalry battle charges) with moments of great psychological depth and some suspense. At times, however, the film seems a bit forced, with exaggerated appeals to sentimentality, as it does in the final sequence, often parodied or imitated in later films. Another problem with the film is that it is not faithful to historical events. Al Capone's arrest was not like that, nor was Ness behind it. The film contains some scenes of great violence and is inadvisable for children, adolescents and impressionable people.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
It's the Chicago Way,"In 1919, over the veto of President Wilson, the Volstead Act was passed, which made provisions for the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment, and successfully ushered in the era of Prohibition; what it did not do, was keep people from drinking, or more significantly, keep certain `businessmen' from selling it, which opened the flood gates to a billion dollar industry of illegal alcohol.  And in the larger cities, the mob bosses jumped onto the bandwagon with both feet, the most notorious of which was Al Capone, who by 1930 had a thriving business and the city and the people of Chicago in his pocket.  From the cop on the beat to the judges sitting on the highest courts, everyone seemingly had a price and could be bought.  And that's the way it was until Treasury Agent Eliot Ness showed up for work and hand picked a squad of honest cops to help him get Capone and clean up the City of Chicago.  `The Untouchables,' directed by Brian De Palma, is the story of Ness and his men, dubbed `Untouchable' because they couldn't be bought, though from the beginning the odds were stacked against them.  They were a handful against an army of hoodlums who wielded grenades and tommy guns, and they could trust no one outside of their own circle, not even the cops with whom they shared the streets.  Many looked upon what Ness was trying to do as an exercise in futility, but he never gave up, and went after Capone with everything he had, which wasn't much beyond his own guts and determination to `do some good.'Ness's initial efforts were a disaster-- Capone had informants everywhere and always knew ahead of time whenever a raid was going down-- so he quickly realized that the only way to do this thing right was to get men he could trust and keep everything quiet.  The bureau responded by sending Ness (Kevin Costner) an accountant, Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), who first had the idea of going after Capone for income tax evasion.  Ness then recruited Jim Malone (Sean Connery), a veteran cop who walked a beat and was well versed in doing things `The Chicago way,' and George Stone (Andy Garcia) a crack shot recruited right out of the Police Academy.Connery gives an exemplary performance as Malone (for which he received the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), the tough, Irish cop who becomes something of a tutor to Ness, letting him know from the start what he's getting himself into.  How do you deal with someone of Capone's ilk?  According to Malone, `If he pulls a knife, you pull a gun.  If he sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue.  That's the Chicago way-- that's how you get Capone.'  It's a perfect part for Connery, whose rugged appearance and demeanor are entirely convincing; he's got that somewhat cynical, world-wise and weary manner of a man who has seen it all, but lets you know that underneath he still holds out hope that some day in some way, right will win out after all.  And Connery plays it with a hard, uncompromising edge that makes it so believable, and makes Malone a memorable character. 														De Palma brings it all vividly to life, building an underlying tension from the beginning that he maintains throughout the film, aided by the intense, sometimes haunting score by Ennio Morricone.  Costner gives a solid performance as Ness, but he is somewhat overshadowed by the actors and the characters who surround him, especially Connery as Malone, and Robert De Niro, who as Capone is absolutely menacing and larger-than-life.  De Niro captures the ruthlessness that indelibly marked Capone's infamy forever in the annals of criminal history, with a portrayal of him that is arguably the best in cinematic history.  De Niro plays it as it lays, presenting Capone as the brutal criminal he was, without attempting to airbrush away any of the attributes that made him so despicable.  It's a terrific performance, for which he should have received at least an Oscar nomination.The supporting cast includes Richard Bradford (Mike), Jack Kehoe (Payne), Brad Sullivan (George), Billy Drago (Nitti) and Patricia Clarkson (Ness' wife).  Extremely well crafted and delivered by De Palma, who had a great screenplay (by David Mamet) and a terrific cast with which to work, `The Untouchables' is a powerful, intense film that successfully evokes this particular period in the history of America.  And it subtly underscores the true heroics of men like Ness and his crew, who through their fearless dedication possibly made it a little safer for someone to walk down the street, or for an honest man to simply go about the business of making a living-- things too often taken for granted in our busy world today; things that are important, and which makes a film like this so much more than merely entertainment (though it definitely is that).  And that's the real magic of the movies.  I rate this one 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Awesome,"Somehow, I just got around to this film after over thirty years. Kevin Costner plays the federal agent Elliot Ness. He pursues Al Capone during Prohibition. His main partner is Sean Connery as a Beat cop in 1930 Chicago. Robert DeNiro is Capone and all three are great. Connery won an Oscar. Ironically, it was tax evasion that was Capone's downfall. This is not a spoiler, as everyone knows the old story. Even so, the Untouchables is a violent and funny adventure. The script is precise and Brian DePalma's direction is as good as expected; never a dull moment. The two hours just flies by.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
My Favorite!,"Quite a few words spring to my mind when I think of The Untouchables. Words like: Excellence, entertainment, larger than life and Sean Connery. These words basically summarize the entire film from my point of view of course because in my opinion (which I don't expect people to agree with) this is the best gangster film there is. Obviously people aren't going to agree because people prefer the likes of the operatic Godfather trilogy or the ultra realistic Goodfellas but in my head The Untouchables is the best.Here are a few reasons why. First reason is that The Untouchables is just so darn entertaining. All the other films had completely different aims and even though I love a deep and brilliant story my main objective when I see a film is to be entertained and basically no film does that better than The Untouchables. That does not mean, however, that The Untouchables is just some half baked action comedy. No. There is genuine emotion and real story in this film. The story is, as most people know, loosely based on the actual events during the prohibition era in USA in the 1920s (the story is also based very, very loosely on the series that go by the same name) which to some extent means that what we see on the screen is real making the characters and general story seem that much more believable. This also adds greatly to the already very high entertainment value of the film because it draws the audience in. To add to the realism of the film the dialog is also very memorable and there are some great one-liners including some of my all time favorites in this film.The acting is nothing short of brilliant. This is without a doubt Kevin Costner's best role. Some people have remarked that he seemed stiff and unable to portray the emotion of the character and to that I can only ask: Were we watching the same movie?! He is a hundred percent believable all the way through. In the beginning he seems a bit too much like a square I-wanna-do-some-good kind of character but as the story progresses he really evolves and becomes more and more emotionally involved in what he does. Both in his friends and in the cause. He even bends some of the rules he initially tried so hard to uphold. Brilliant. Charles Martin Smith does a good job as well and even though his character is very limited he still manages to pull the audience in. Andy Garcia appears in this film in a very limited role as well and he serves his purpose brilliantly. He is the sharpshooter of the group and he is perfectly believable in that part. He doesn't get to say much but what he does get to say is said with as much passion as I have ever heard from him (he seemed a little stale and lifeless in Godfather III). Robert DeNiro is great as Al Capone. He steals every scene he is in and he really brings the larger-than-life quality to the character which is extremely fitting. The film's best performance belongs to Sean Connery though. The film is for lack of a better expression a Sean Connery tour-de-force. Not only does he steal every scene he is in but he also brings the certain indescribable something to the character that he always does and in every situation you feel with him (as you do in all his films whether he is a villain or a hero). He also got a well deserved Oscar for his performance. People have claimed that the Oscar wasn't as much for this particular performance but an Oscar in recognition of his contributions to the film industry. This belittles his performance which I can safely say is the best of his career and one of the best displays of acting that I have ever seen.The film also has a memorable score made by the legendary Ennio Morricone who is perhaps best known for the work he did with the equally legendary western director Sergio Leone (who doesn't know the score from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) and in my opinion the score he did for The Untouchables is the best he has ever made. The score is very unlike most scores from the 80s which does that the film doesn't feel like an 80s film as much as Scarface which I find inferior to this masterpiece. The score is grand and epic just like the story and the effects. For an 80s movie the effects are pretty amazing. Once again everything works.All in all The Untouchables is a riveting story which is highly recommendable to all fans of crime/gangster movies.10/10 - on my top 10 of best films",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brian De Palma's Masterpiece,"""The Untouchables"" is in my opinion De Palma's greatest work, with his other masterpiece, namely ""Scarface"", coming a very close second. In ""Scarface"" the focus is on a paranoid and self-destructive gangster who rises to meteoric heights and then falls; in ""The Untouchables"" the focus is on a very honest man with a noble mission, Elliot Ness (Kostner), who is prepared to do anything to clean Chicago from the corruption and mayhem caused by the notorious gangster Al Capone (De Niro). His quest is really tough, as his opponent is determined and powerful, but he has the help of three invaluable partners: Malone (Connery), a no-nonsense experienced cop, Wallace (Martin Smith), an accountant who will try to help bring tax charges against Capone, and Stone (Garcia), a great shooter.As I noted before the film is brilliantly directed, with some scenes such as the one with the baseball bat, or the one with the baby in the train station, having become classic. The acting is superb, and while Connery was the one who received his well-deserved Oscar, Kostner and De Niro made Oscar-class performances too.Although belonging to a typical genre, this film certainly stands out. Don't miss it! 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Untouchables,"An excellent movie with an excellent story. I am a person who does not know anything about the story of Al Capone's fall, and this film presented it to me excellently, the acting was very good, but I think if the acting could have been better, it was especially from Robert De Niro, the atmosphere of the film was excellent and it simulated the 1920s From the twentieth century, I really enjoyed watching the film and I recommend watching it",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Few Films Can Touch Its Excellence.,"Outstanding production that was the best film of 1987 with the exception of the very dominant ""The Last Emperor"". ""The Untouchables"" is the story of Elliot Ness (perfectly played by Kevin Costner) who tries to bring down Chicago Mob boss Al Capone (Robert DeNiro in one of his most under-rated roles) during the early-1930s. Illegal liquor smuggling and other much more serious crimes are running amok and corruption is all over. Costner realizes very fast that he must hand-pick his own men to bring DeNiro down for good. Thus he enlists the help of a young cop from the academy (Andy Garcia), a wimpy book-keeper (Charles Martin Smith) and a hard-nosed Irish beat cop (Oscar-winner Sean Connery in the performance of a lifetime). Together they slowly start to peel through the multiple layers of protection to get DeNiro for good. It seems that the fact that DeNiro has been lax in paying his income taxes could be his ultimate downfall. Beautifully directed by Brian De Palma, ""The Untouchables"" stands very tall with the other great productions of the 1980s. Ennio Morricone's Oscar-nominated score is one of the finest the cinema has ever experienced. Really excellent. I have no negative comments on this production. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Never stop fighting till the fight is done, here endeth the lesson.","As good a gangster movie that has ever been made as DePalma does justice to Mamet's electric script. The acting on show is right out of the top draw, the inevitable ease that DeNiro puts menace into Capone is quite impressive, whilst the fresh faced pugnacious tenacity of Andy Garcia's George Stone is something of a delightful experience. Yet that is not enough because we still need the central actors to carry the film if it is going to triumph. Connery is a given performance wise (accent aside of course, but then again who cares when the character portrayal is as sharp as it is here?) but it is Costner as Eliot Ness that shines like the star he was soon to become, it's a magic performance that manages to fuse genuine tenderness of family love with little trips to the dark side in pursuit of making good triumph over evil.I love that the film is showing how violence and fear affects families, mother and child is a theme that is central to the film's heartbeat, notice how some of the more violent scenes are followed by tender scenes of Ness and his family. The set pieces here are attention grabbing entertainment, a roaring Canadian border rumpus and a smashing roof top pursuit and face off are top value, but it's DePalma gold watching a brilliant Battleship Potemkin homage at the Union train station that takes the cake as the film enters the last quarter. Surely historical facts does not matter when films are as sharp as this one is?. It's frightening, touching, and even witty. So for me at least, the film is 10/10 in every department (and yes, even with Sean's accent).Footnote: The academy saw fit to nominate Ennio Morricone for his wonderful score, yet strangely he used some of it for the main theme in John Carpenter's 1982 film ""The Thing"", they must have missed it that time I presume! Must be the genre angle one thinks...",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Better-than-average cop-drama, but vastly overrated","Better-than-average cop-drama. That's about the best one can say about this movie. For a crime drama, it is not very gritty and is filled with Hollywood clichés.Reasonably interesting but could have been great. However, there are so many Hollywoodisms and glamourisations it feels quite superficial.The weak script and formulaic movie-for-the-masses directing by Brian De Palma are compounded by the usual unconvincing performance from Kevin Costner. He alternates between dead boring and overly gung ho here.Sean Connery is almost equally flat and unconvincing.In fact, there's hardly a convincing and/or engaging performance to be found here. The only good one comes from Robert De Niro who is charming and suitably mean and scary as Al Capone.Vastly overrated.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Untouchable.,"It's Prohibition-era Chicago, and mob boss Al Capone (Robert De Niro) controls the illegal shipment of alcohol into the city. Federal Agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner), vows to bring him down. Assembling a crack squad consisting of: Seasoned Cop Jimmy Maloy (Sean Connery), dead-eyed rookie George Stone (Andy Garcia), and bookish Accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith). It is with this simple story that spawns a beautifully crafted piece of film-making. Sean Connery gives a compelling performance as Maloy; he's dedicated, determined, and dangerous. Kevin Costner is great as a man, just out to ""Do Some Good"". And Finally, you can't forget Robert De Niro. It must be his general calm that's so unnerving about him, as if you never know what he'll do next. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies.

"The sum of its good individual components, no more","Director Brian De Palma is the son of a surgeon, and perhaps this explains his high tolerance for the bloodshed that has translated into brutal, raw scenes in 'The Untouchables'. Then again, this film is set during one of the bloodiest chapters of American history and demands unflinching depiction accordingly. Zooming in on prohibition-era Chicago, a dirty, dingy, crime-infested retreat of mafia, the film lets us know a special unit headed by Kevin Costner whose objective is to frame the super villain himself  Al Capone (Robert De Niro).There are, in effect, three or four things that truly stand out about The Untouchablesan otherwise standard crime by-the-numbers rompand at least one of them should be attributed to the surface of the spectacle; the costumework and settings are superbly breathed life into, as is De Palma's accolade, with a screen that is awash with lyrical colours and accompanied by a swelly, jazzy moonlit music score. Another worthy accolade is of course Sean Connery as detective Malone  an American-Irish cop on the beat and down with the ways of the street  who may deliver one of the worst accents in film history, but makes up for what he lacks in verbal power with heaps of charisma. Malone is given, by far, the best dialogue in David Mamet's script as when he instructs Kevin Costner on how to get to Capone: ""He puts one of yours in the hospital, you put one of his in the morgue.""Another worthy staple to The Untouchables is its strong individual scenes. In the front row for these sits the notorious baseball bat scene in which a furious Al Capone beats one of his associates' head into a bloody pulp with a bat, right in front of all the guests at the grand dinner table. Robert De Niro gained weight for his role as the crime-lord Al Capone and approaches his character with commitment, but sadly he is ineffective in the film as De Palma does not quite know what to do with him. Instead he craggily intercuts Capone's boisterous speeches and monologues with the template storyline of Kevin Costner's special unit, and the former are incongruous to the key story of 'The Untouchables'. Here it regrettably becomes apparent that the film possesses all the necessary ingredients but no blender in which to stir it  and De Palma is largely to blame for lacking the necessary skill.Having said that, The Untouchables keeps up the appearance of an epic crime film so rigorously through seamless costumes, stinky Chicago accents, vivid chases and a swarming taste to its sets that for a long time we are led to believe that De Palma has truly done it with this film. Certainly there are many scenes that testify to this and aptly camoflauge the shortcomings, such as the suspenseful pre-battle sequence at the Canadian border in which the Western-loving Costner is up on horseback to ambush the incoming shipment. Another is the first meeting between Andy Garcia and Sean Connery, in which the latter decides to recruit Garcia's Italian character in spite of racial feuding (Connery's supposed to be Irish), and instead because he likes his mouthy, bold attitude. Finally there is the unspeakably epic climax scene that plays on operatic in length through a long, glorious slow-motion capture by a staircase, politely nodding to The Battleship Potemkin's 'Odessa Steps Sequence'.The whole film is in fact an operatic affair with technicalities deluxe. With its mindboggling ensemble (Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, Robert De Niro, Andy Garcia and Patricia Clarkson) it is easy to see how it is cuing us in to like it. To some extent it succeeds well, for it is suspenseful, but it is not well sewn-together. What good is a De Niro if you are not going to use him opposite the rest? What good is a Kevin Costner (who has never looked so ridiculously handsome in his career for that matter) if you are not going to let him emote? And lastly, what good is a large handful of fully-fledged wonderful scenes if you are not going to juxtapose them with something, instead of dishing them out every now and then to keep our interest?7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Fun Movie, Though Don't Expect A Documentary!","When I was 11 or 12, I thought that this was the coolest movie ever made. And why not? It had some great action scenes, extremely good heroes, and extremely nasty villains. On that level, the film is perfect. Now that I'm a bit older, I still enjoy the film a lot, just not as much as I used to. It certainly isn't on my top ten list.In the 1930's, Prohibition is in full swing, and Chicago mob boss Al Capone (Robert De Niro) rules over his empire with bombs, bribes, and machine guns. Since Prohibition is very unpopular with the American people, who's going to stand up to Capone? Enter straight-laced young Treasury Agent Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner), who wants to do the right thing but realizes that the methods required are much more unorthodox, what with the corrupt police department and all. He enlists the help of an aging beat cop (Sean Connery in an Oscar-winning performance), a nebbish accountant (Charles Martin Smith) and a young police cadet who's a crack shot with a pistol (Andy Garcia) and begins taking down Capone ""the Chicago way"". After many shootouts, liquor raids, and assassinations, it all comes down to a climactic showdown - on the roof of a crowded courthouse! - between Ness and Capone's chief henchman, Frank Nitti (Billy Drago).The movie is, as has been pointed out, much more faithful to the original television series with Robert Stack than the historical record, of which it bears virtually no resemblance, not that that is necessarily a problem. In real life, there were up to a dozen ""Untouchables"", whose success was very limited, and never got into any actual shootouts with Capone (though Capone did try to kill Ness himself on at least two occasions). Capone thought of Ness as a publicity seeking nuisance, nothing more; the two never even met face-to-face. Frank Wilson and the IRS had a LOT more to do with Capone's indictment than Ness and the Untouchables ever did. And of course Frank Nitti lived for over a decade after Capone was jailed.That being said: who cares? This was intended as a fun, classy action movie, not a historical documentary. The movie is extremely authentic in attention to period detail, and though a bit over-the-top, it succeeds in its primary objective: to entertain. The movie was meant as a cross between a classy gangster film and a good old-fashioned cops'n'robbers shoot-'em-up, and was highly successful at that.The acting is great all around, with Costner and Connery in particular giving one of their best performances. Costner does a creditable job at making Ness go from a greenhorn do-gooder (the scene where he yells at the corpse of a gangster he's had to kill is one of the movie's few weak moments) to a tough, hard-assed veteran in a little over two hours, no mean feat. Connery does a great job as Malone, the aging, guilt-ridden cop who becomes Ness's mentor (though his death scene is a bit overdone, I must admit I actually cried the first time I saw it!). Garcia and Smith have somewhat less to do, though each have their moments (Smith sipping bootleg whiskey during the bridge ambush, and Garcia's initial confrontation with Ness and Malone). De Niro, who made a career playing gangsters, takes the logical step of playing THE single most famous gangster of all time, Al Capone, and DeNiro, Method actor that he is, does a great job managing to look, sound, and act the part, despite very limited screen time (does ANYONE come away from this film not remembering the infamous baseball scene?). Drago fits the part of a sneering, one-dimensional villain, and manages to make Nitti a menacing and even charismatic character despite having little to work with. Other talented character actors - Richard Bradford, Jack Kehoe, Patricia Clarkson, Brad Sullivan, Del Close, Clifford James - round out the cast.Where the movie excels, however, are its action sequences. The ambush of Capone's bootleg convoy at the Canadian border is simply exhilarating, and the suspenseful rooftop shootout between Ness and Nitti is extremely memorable as well. But what steals the show is the wonderfully done ""Potemkin"" homage in Union Station, where Ness and Stone try to apprehend Capone's book keeper, take out his bodyguards, AND save a baby carriage pluming down the stairs. Virtually the whole scene is done in slow motion, and is indescribably intense and even beautiful.Ennio Morricone provides a wonderful score, and I'm not sure why he dislikes it so much, as he's said in interviews. True, it's not up to par with his works for Sergio Leone's films, but what is? He provides an exhilarating, heroic score which captures the feel and tone of the movie perfectly (though for my money, the heartbreaking ""Death Theme"", played on solo saxophone, is the best track).Overall, ""The Untouchables"" is NOT a great gangster film, like ""The Godfather"" or ""Once Upon A Time In America"", nor is it an accurate account of the real-life events it portrays. But it's a fun, extremely stylish, well-made and enjoyable film, and on that score, I can wholeheartedly recommend it.Score: 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""Untouchable"" - True Gangster Greatness","I'm going to make this short and to the point:To me, Eliot Ness and the Untouchables were true patriots, fighting to end corruption wherever it reared its ugly head. With that in mind, 1987's ""The Untouchables"" is one of the greatest gangster movies - period. Brian De Palma, coming down off of the landmark gangster classic ""Scarface"" (1983), continued the trend with this carefully woven tale (screenplay complements of David Mamet) about Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner, perfectly cast) and his band of incorruptible federal agents. Ness is as naive as they come - bright-eyed and ready to take gangsterism down the ""old"" way - but being that this is Prohibition-era Chicago, the police are on the take, and no one can be trusted for fear of retribution from Al Capone (Robert De Niro). Ness finds his most trusted and loyal partner in a beat officer, Jimmy Malone (Oscar-Winner Sean Connery), who so carefully spells the law out out for him, ""He {Capone} sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue!"" The Untouchables certainly do seem to overstep their boundaries in bringing Capone down, using a number of well-planned and law-bending tactics. The cinematography is beautiful, helping to capture the gangster-era in all its glory, and the Ennio Morricone score really gets you pumping for the action. De Palma is at his greatest in directorial excellence in staging stellar, heart-pumping action sequences (with the Morricone score blasting away too), which come to include the Canadian liquor bust, the train-station shootout, and the ending rooftop chase between Ness and Capone's #1 hit-man Frank Nitti (Billy Drago). Beware though, since this is De Palma territory here, we should be on the lookout for some scenes of pretty stylized bloody violence and the blood + guts action that characterized the times. Still, ""The Untouchables"" is one of my top 10 ""must-see"" pictures and I'm sure it's essential viewing for any gangster movie aficionado.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Another reason for loving this movie is, that it is full of really bad editing mistakes. The best one being the roof top scene, where Ness helps Niiti to his car.

I thought the Untouchables movie was very interesting with some great gunfights and a good story.For the most part, the acting was very good in this movie. Robert DeNiro was frighteningly good as Al Capone, and Kevin Costner did a great job as Elliot Ness. I believe, however, that Sean Connery stole the show as Jim Malone, the tough old cop who knew in order to beat the crime you had to resort to their level.The story is simple. Elliot Ness, a ""cop"" from the treasury department of the FBI is sent to make sure that Al Capone is brought to justice, but has trouble doing so. He seeks the help of Jim Malone, a worn-out beat cop, and a few others to take Capone out.

"""If Capone Puts One Of Your's In The Hospital, You Put One Of His In The Morgue""","Not that I'm complaining mind you because The Untouchables is a quality motion picture that got Sean Connery an Oscar for a lifetime of work, but one fine day we just might get the real story of Eliot Ness and his Untouchable squad of Treasury agents. For those who are fans of Brian DePalma's film it's no more accurate than the famous Untouchable series in the Fifties or its counterpart in the Nineties.The plain truth is that Eliot Ness's operations against Al Capone's liquor supply did hurt him economically somewhat, but hardly slowed down his operation in Chicago. As for the income tax conviction that eventually did land Capone in Alcatraz, it was accomplished by the hard working accountants in US Attorney George W. Johnson's office. In the film that is the Clifton James character and Ness and his squad did work for him, but Charles Martin Smith's character would not have been an Untouchable.Whatever else Ness was, he was a master of generating good publicity for his work, the same way J. Edgar Hoover was, or Thomas E. Dewey, right down to Rudolph Giuliani in our time. That is in fact, part of a good crime fighter's job, the more people know of your successful good work, the more cooperation you get from the public. When Ness who went on to become the Chief of Police in Cleveland and then unsuccessful Republican candidate for Mayor of same, his career and finances took a nose dive. Just before he died he worked with writer Oscar Fraley on a memoir of his work and this became the cornerstone of The Untouchables franchise. Very much like what Wyatt Earp did just before he died, giving interviews for an authorized biography by Stuart Lake which became the basis for all the Wyatt Earp films done since the Thirties.Unlike the original TV series The Untouchables, Eliot Ness's Scandinavian background as versus the Italian Al Capone is made much of in this film. Kevin Costner is your basic good guy and Robert DeNiro joins a great list of actors like Rod Steiger, Neville Brand, and Jason Robards, Jr. in interpreting the volatile crime boss of Chicago who has come down in legend himself.Costner's a Boy Scout in this business and as Sean Connery says to him, those kind of rules are out the window in dealing with people like Al Capone. His bit of philosophy given to Costner when Costner recruits him for The Untouchables is the title of the review. Connery plays an honest patrolman of Irish descent who hates dishonesty, but also don't think a little prejudice against the Italian Capone isn't involved in his thinking as well. Jimmy Malone is a broad and expansive part that Sean Connery can work wonders with.To be honest I don't think The Untouchables is Connery's best work, one friend has told me The Name of The Rose is his favorite, another has said Woman Of Straw is his favorite. My personal favorite among Sean Connery's performances is the incredibly neglected The Molly Maguires. But like John Wayne's True Grit, Sean Connery's Oscar is for the work of a lifetime for a man who may be the most well known international film star we've ever had.Now Billy Drago's Frank Nitti is a performance that will leave you chilled for days and susceptible to pneumonia. That it's far from the real Frank Nitti and that Nitti did not end the way Drago does in the film is irrelevant. But that's just another inaccuracy of the film.Brian DePalma wasn't trying for accuracy, he was trying to make an entertaining film. In that he succeeded.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good Movie, But I Still Prefer Stack Over Costner As 'Elliot Ness'","I never could quite reconcile Kevin Costner's somewhat-high and weak voice with some of macho characters he played when he was younger, but I can get past that after a film has settled into the story. Costner is a good enough actor to make me believe he's anyone after awhile.However, after years of growing up watching Robert Stack playing ""Elliot Ness"" on TV on the hit series, ""The Untouchables,"" it took me a bit to accept Costner in that role. That part will always belong to Mr. Stack.At first, he just did not speak with the authority of a tough Chicago cop out to get Al Capone and the racketeers from the Prohibition Age in Chicago. His partner, ""Oscar Wallace,"" played by the little nerdy-looking Charles Martin Smith as a gun-toting T-Man, is even harder to believe. Of the ""good guys,"" Andy Garcia is the only likeble and believable guy. Sean Connery has the best character in the film (""Jim Malone"") and is the most interesting to watch.Nonetheless, it's a good story with good characters and just about he right amount of action. It moves very well, which tells me the movie is entertaining. There are a few memorable scenes, such as the shootout at the train station with the baby carriage descending the stairway and a memorable scene with Robert De Niro as Capone.This is a tough, very violent and bloody movie.....nothing like the old TV show.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Ness, Malone, Wallace & Stone: The Untouchables","""The Untouchables"" is one the most complete films of the 1980's and one of the most unforgettable films of Brian De Palma. An Untouchable classic. It has an great ensemble cast, the 1930's period re-enactment is excellent, the magical music by Ennio Morricone and the incredible cinematography and editing. If you didn't see it you must see it now!1930. Chicago. During the Prphibition Al Capone (Robert De Niro) is flying high, making a lot of money with the bootleg of vast amounts of alcohol and of course the law is on his side (buying judges and corrupted officers). If you're against Capone get ready to run because he's implacable and kills those who betray him even bashing with a baseball bat the head of an colleague who failed in his duties. It's also the time of Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) an honest man working as Treasure Agent and he's in charge of putting Capone behind bars. Capone is untouchable, dishonest and got the most dangerous crew on his side. Ness has a chance?Well, now he has three good souls on his side and things can be very different and Chicago might be another good place to live again. Ness's companies includes Malone (Sean Connery), an old and smart street officer who's up for anything, sometimes following rules and other times creating his own rules; Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) an accountant that wants to arrest Capone for not paying his taxes; and Stone (Andy Garcia) the best shooter of the police force. These are The Untouchables and with them there isn't things that they cannot solve it, no one can buy them, and those who are at the wrong side of the law are going to be killed or arrested.Writer David Mamet opted for not writing the real story of the events or even make a film version of the series of the 1950's. Instead he opted for an original work about four simple guys fighting against injustice and facing mortal threats. And to tell a story like that in the 1980's was a completely risk of failure in the box-office if one considers that the movies of that decade that were real commercial success were muscular heroes like Rambo or Terminator and many others. But with Brian De Palma directing, a great story developed and a amazing ensemble cast ""The Untouchables"" turned out to be one of the most remarkable movies of that decade and Sean Connery proved to be a actor even more talented than he is, and earn a Oscar in the following year.De Palma is known for his technique on editing, planning movies almost like Hitchcock (his idol) and here everything is done marvelously well. In the most climatic moment of the movie (the Stairway Shootout) he made a fantastic homage to ""The Battleship Potemkin"" (Sergei Eisenstein's film). Here Stone and Ness are in a shooting against Capone's thugs and in the middle of this shooting are Capone's accountant (Jack Kehoe), a woman and his baby in a baby carriage that runs out of control in the stairs. Unforgettable! And of course Ennio Morricone's memorable musical themes. He was robbed an Oscar and a Golden Globe in 1988. He has a tremendous job here, setting the music in the cold and dark Chicago atmosphere, and he knows how to use the variation of instruments in a same theme for different scenes (For instance: the ""Death theme"" is used twice, two different scenes, but if you notice Ennio makes little changes with instruments). Brilliant!It's a mystery to me that there are people who simply just don't care about this film calling it superficial, or saying that everything was weak. I Disagree. I never get tired of watching this movie and see a great cast performing incredibly well, it has a good story (way better than some today's movies) and it's one of the best films of the 1980's. De Palma's top of that decade along with ""Scarface"", ""Blown Out"", ""Body Double"", ""Dressed to Kill"" and ""Casualties of War"" A must see film! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brilliantly and stylishly recreated story about Elliot Ness and Al'Scarface'Capone,"This splendid film is set during Prohibition era Chicago in the 30s . Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) gets the government's go-ahead to form his own particular group of relentless , honest Federal Agents (Sean Connery , Charles Martin Smith , Andy Garcia) to combat Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and his hoodlums, specially Frank Nitti (Billy Drago) . Ness reunites honorable, upright cops to fight corruption and the grandiose mobster . It leads in forays against heinous racketeers , corrupt bootleggers and other evil enemies . At the beginning they fail miserably and the crusader anti-alcohol cops bust out , though finally score . The Chicago Dream is that big . No one messed with Al Capone, but Eliot Ness messed with him AL CAPONE. He ruled Chicago with absolute power. No one could touch him. No one could stop him. - Until Eliot Ness and a small force of men swore they'd bring him down. What are you prepared to do? .Never stop fighting till the fight is doneThis is a violence-ridden story full of action , drama , thriller and being pretty entertaining . Intelligent and suspenseful script by David Mamet (Pulitzer winning playwright) . Spectacular shootém up on the station steps remains with echoes of 'The battleship Potemkin' (Sergei Einstein,1925) . Kevin Costner is excellent as impulsive and obstinate enforcer fighting against the underworld crime . Sean Connery (Academy-award winning acting) plays in perfection a veteran , incorruptible police who takes under his experience and protection to Ness . And Robert De Niro overacting in a serious-comical role as the nasty Capone . Flamboyant and rich photography by cameraman Stephen H. Burum. Sensitive and emotive musical score by the great master Ennio Morricone . The motion picture was beautifully directed by Brian De Palma . This superb recounting will appeal immensely to Kevin Costner and Sean Connery fans.Other adaptations about Capone are as follows : ¨Capone¨ with Rod Steiger and ¨Capone¨by Steve Carver with Ben Gazarra . And others mostly realized for television , such as : ¨The Scarface mob (1962)¨ by Phil Karlson with Robert Stack and Neville Brand and ¨Elliot Ness¨with Tom Amandes and William Forshyte.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"could have, should have....","This one isn't holding up all that well in my books. There are some undoubtedly fantastic scenes and Oscar-worthy performances. But the overall quality is spotty.Connery's performance remains one of my all-time favorites. His first meeting with Ness is very enjoyable. His death scene never fails to move me every single time I watch it. Great musical score as well.DeNiro's Capone is too one-dimensional (no fault of his), Martin-Smith's is entirely cartoonish. Garcia is good, as is Costner, the earnestness which always characterizes his performances finding a perfect match in the character of Ness.The bridge scene is so bad that it almost ruins the whole film. Connery manages to provide some saving grace with his interrogation tactics and opposition to running.It seems as if this film is composed of nothing but caricatures, from the photographer to the police trainee, but the performances are so good and there are so many strong scenes that they somehow balance out the crude (read banal) writing. A friend of mine saw an interview with Mamet in which he said that the best stuff was actually edited out of the final product. Ya gotta hate studios. The Untouchables really could have been much better than it already is.",,Anonymous,Crime
Crime Thriller.,"An officer decides to hunt down the untouchable alcohol king Al Capone. He was very confident in his moves. But, he learned that he can trust no one in the force. Then he decides to team up with 3 other officers and go for the adventure. It is obvious that they had to face the consequences.This film is one of the best crime thrillers.

"Sean Connery Wins The Oscar, And Kevin Costner Takes A Huge Step Towards Being A Superstar","Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order, I come to The UntouchablesPlot In A Paragraph: Federal Agent Eliot Ness (KC) sets out to stop Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and he assembles a small hand-picked team who can not be bought.OK, I'll get it out if the way straight away, it's historically inaccurate, but what it does have, is great direction, great performances, great sets, great costumes, a great score and a great screenplay. The screenplay by David Mammet has it all!! Good guys, bad guys, a fast moving plot, some good dialogue, the occasional bit of humour and sickening tragedy. OK, it's more style over depth, but that's not a problem for me.In 1987, KC was still relatively unknown. He may have had a semi-recognizable face (if only for Silverado), going into this film, but this was the role that propelled him to stardom. It's not a great performance from KC, but is perfect for straight arrow, family man Elliot Ness. He is not meant to be an over the top action hero, and had he gave a more energetic performance (like he gave in Fandango and Silverado) it might have ruined things.De Niro is a larger than life Al Capone, Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith both offer solid support as does Billy Drago, but the movies best performance belongs to Sean Connery as Malone, a man who always has a one sentence rule/quote for every occasion.When Connery won his Oscar, many critics saw it as a ""lifetime achievement"" award (like Al Pacino's Oscar for Scent Of A Woman). I think this is grossly unfair on his performance here, which I do believe is award worthy in its own right.One of my few problems with the movie is following on from a characters death (no spoilers even though it is 29 years old) the violent shoot out at the train station, then the Ness V Nitti confrontation, the ending feels a little flat, but that's probably just me.With a $67 million domestic gross, KC had the biggest hit of his career, so far, as The Untouchables ended the year the 6th highest grossing movie of 1987. Grossing more than movies like Predator, Lethal Weapon, Dirty Dancing, Wall Street and the James Bond movie The Living Daylights.I almost gave it a 10/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Mostly fiction, little fact, the story of the 'untouchable' Treasury agent Elliot Ness that took the badest of the bad bootleggers, the infamous unconvictable Alfonse Capone (who else could do this but Di Niro?)

Superb music by Ennio Morricone and excellent cinematography provide the film with an exciting epic swoop without ruining its historical credibility. Sean Connery, in a role he won an Oscar for, Kevin Costner, and Robert De Niro, in a brilliant realisation of Al Capone, are all in top form. If being nit-picky one might fault the film in over-glorifying Eliot Ness, but that hardly subtracts from this exciting, excellently filmed experience, which has both style and substance.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Honourable flashback to the classic film-noirs from the 30's to the 60's.,"If you are like me and like a good film-noir or two then I recommend you watch this film which plays out exactly like a film-noir, with camera work, angles, lighting and editing all perfectly suiting the polished and straight-forward style of the genre. The Untouchables is a movie that contains clichés from the genre but uses them to it's own intentional advantage and if this film were in black-and- white I would of believed that it truly was a movie brilliantly created around the 40's. Some do not like style over substance and that's okay, but in order to warn some viewers I will state that this is more of a visual feat in terms of experience, but myself I don't necessarily consider style over substance a bad thing and I have actually created a strong respect for films simply having good cinematography and editing. The editing flows the film all together in the traditional film-noir manner, comprehending the film into an understandable experience and never losing grip of it's tone because of the good editing. Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, Andy Garcia and Robert De Niro star as the main characters and all deliver performances worthy of the film, both expressing their characters realistically and in a style fully according to the film-noir genre.

Kevin costner fails in this role, just the pitch of his voice makes me laugh imagine the criminals of 1930 hearing that guy yell at them lol. But moreover hes just very sub par for the supposed intensity of this film. De Nero does a good job as always but honestly this is an amazing story and reading about it is more interesting than the way this film turned out.

Were we watching the same movie?,"I don't understand how on earth this movie gets a 7.8 rating.  It's terrible!

It's pretty... they did a good job with the cars, outfits, locations, etc., but the dialogue is laughable and the way the story was crafted left nothing to suspense.  I understand that they had limits because it was an account of a true story, but they still could have told us certain things and saved some things for later.  The way the little mousy guy kept referring to his tax problems... we all know that's how they brought him down, but they gave that away in the first 20 minutes!  And the music... terrible!  I actually perked up when I saw Ennio Morricone's name at the beginning because I loved his work in ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"".  But the director never used it to build suspense.  They didn't build any dramatic scenes with it, and when they did, he used all the wrong music.I am terribly disappointed with this movie.  I want my two hours of life back.

Simply Flawless,"Old but gold, The Untouchables captures all the heartache, suffering, salvation one can experience, in a fast, thrilling crime drama, with an exceptional cast.Despite Prohibition in the USA, a mobster, Al Capone, continues his illicit liquor business. A federal agent, Eliot Ness, is assigned to expose Capone's illegal business and bring him to justice.Based on an autobiographical memoir by Eliot Ness co-written with Oscar Fraley, published in 1957 of the same name; the film is a classic exemplar of vintage entertainment - a vibrant production with all the chases, gunshots and altercations any film lover can withstand. The most effective employment of the movie's script is the effect it has in its audience; we instantly feel connected with the characters on a personal level, allowing us to empathise with the events that take place, we suffer through visualising suffering - and that is a chief component of a perfect piece.The cast (as mentioned previously) is top-tier; Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, Robert De Niro and Andy Garcia star in the 1987 blockbuster, which grossed over $100 million in the Box Office. Despite its $25 million budget. Connery picked up the film's only Oscar from 4 total nominations in the Academy Awards. The wise actors play their assignments to a tee, offering convincing displays that marry Brian De Palma's camerawork to the ever-so-enticing plot.Albert H. Wolff, the last survivor of the real-life Untouchables, was a consultant on this movie, and helped Kevin Costner with his portrayal of Eliot Ness, a fine example of the care and polish handled toward the script, ensuring nothing short of excellence was achieved. Also emphasising the true commitment of production, in telling the story in exactly the manner to which events unfolded.The movie is an icon for all to appreciate, an untouchable ornament of cinematic history.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Eliot Ness and his small band of Untouchables.,the Real life story of Eliot Ness reads like a adventure novel that ends on a tragic note.But it makes for a great movie. now granted Hollywood being Hollywood changed things around and added or subtracted many elements of the Real Untouchables. to start off with Eliot Ness became a prohibition agent because it was the law of the land. and he hated the wide spread corruption to him the law was the law a good law or a bad law to him it didn't matter it needed enforcing. When Ness was given the assignment to bring down Capone . he mentioned a idea of a flying squad composed of nine honest men. Ness never wanted to head it up. but the situation in Chicago was so desperate. that they never gave it any chance of success and appointed Ness the leader. and right away Ness and his men went to work attacking Capone from the streets while the Government worked at getting Capone from the business level of not paying taxes Both teams did their job very well. and Ness and his boys stole the headlines when one paper called them THE UNTOUCHABLES .When Hollywood decided to remake the classic Robert Stack Series . they went with a script that took all the truth out of it. Gone were the historical facts . There was never a older Chicago cop who mentored Ness and the other Untouchables. The Role of James Malone wonderfully played by Sean Connery is a work of fiction. And Connery steals the show as the street cop with a heart of gold turned Federal agent. The entire idea of going to the academy to get a young rookie to help would have been laughed at in the 30s. George Stone would have been seen as too big of a risk for dangerous work like this. But Depalma and Connery and Costner and Gracia make it work. And third the Governemnt never sent an accountant to Chicago to work at it from a street level. but Charles Martin Smith makes his Oscar Wallace work so well that you don't mind the historical mistake. And no member of the Untouchables was ever killed by Capone . Only one member of the Untouchables outside circle was killed as a warning. Frank Basile who was the driver for Eliot Ness and helped the Untouchables in their work that Paul Robsky one of the last Untouchables called Basile a unofficial Untouchable.But still all the inaccurate information aside. The Untouchables is as great as a epic movie that you could ever hope to find. Kevin Costner plays a very human and very moral man pushed into a unthinkable situation in which he must stop the beast by working outside the law. Sean Connery steals the Movie . his James Malone is the honest beat cop with a heart of gold who is simply after 20 years on the beat trying to stay alive. Malone is a widower. He knows too much and he keeps his mouth shut. Because saying anything to the wrong people could get him killed at a second's notice. It's Ness who gives him the courage to go out and stop the monster that's ruling Chicago.Robert De niro is in fine form in one of his greatest roles Ever. Mention Deniro and chances are the untouchables is the first second or third movie mentioned. And for good reason as well He oozes evil and madness as Capone. As well as Charm. the real life Capone was charming and Deniro shows us to how charming he could be.Andy Garcia and Charles Martin Smith fill out the rest of the Untouchables. and do grand work. The Story is solid and the climatic shoot out in the Train Station is a work of art. Brian De palma has every right to be proud of that scene. Its not overly long but its a complicated scene which must have been a nightmare to film. But it holds together so well.Historical real life aside. The Untouchables is as great as it gets .My only hope is that next time they decide to do one closer to the truth. but until then I'll enjoy this one.,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A good movie but,"It's a really cool movie, great performance by most actors, a lot of action.The storyline is not as slow as in many movies(no offense to The Godfather)all developments occur in rapid tempo so it's not a moment boring to watch. but the music (which I think is a big part of a movie) sucked in my opinion. Visually it's like the 30's, nice old cars, tommy-gun's, Canadian booze, the only thing I was missing was the 'mafia style' music, which in my opinion would have made the movie a lot more fun to watch.

Outstanding performances by all!,"I know this film isn't historically accurate, but then again, historical accuracies don't always make for great drama. Sean Connery has some of the snappiest, wittiest lines ever spoken in a film, such as, ""Isn't that just like a Wop! Brings a knife to a gunfight!"" Kevin Costner's rather laid-back Eliot Ness also works, I believe, far better than if Robert Stack had reprized his TV role. Kudos to Brian DePalma for a job well done, and for dispensing with his usual scoring by Pino Donaggio and relying on the established talent of Ennio Morricone to score the film. It was only a matter of time before Robert DeNiro portrayed Al Capone in a film, and in this one, he's just right. No other actor could have been as perfect in the role of Capone than DeNiro.

Where all the stars aligned,"I'm not sure if there was some funny business or early trolling going on back around 2005/06 but all of a sudden a certain number of members started rating this movie 1/10 in an effort to get it out of the IMDB top 250. I don't understand this directed and purposeful hate for the movie.I know that De Palma can be a little polarizing for some people but this is one of his most mainstream and conventional movies. He directed it mostly how Mamet wrote it. Some reviews say that the dialogue is laughable? That is not what most film students would agree with as it was written by David Mamet, the king of dialogue. This film has some of the best and most memorable lines in film. If you want real dialogue, watch Mamet's 'Glengarry Glen Ross'. Perfection!I saw someone else criticize the music score. WTF! This music score won the legendary Ennio Morricone a Grammy and an Oscar nomination, following his other nominated scores for The Mission & Once Upon a Time in America. Personally, I love this score and have the soundtrack on cd. I think it's one of the best of the 80s alongside Once Upon a Time & The Mission. Incidentally, The Mission score was originally used on the first trailer as he hadn't completed the soundtrack at the time.Others criticize Connery's accent. OK, that was the running joke at the time, but anyone who knows Connery's work knows he sounds the same in all his movies ('The Hunt for Red October' anyone?) and takes nothing away from his Best Supporting Actor Oscar win.Most reviews love this movie and I'm one of them. For me, the stars aligned on every level. The brilliance of Brian De Palma, the music of Ennio Morricone, the costumes and sets, the look and style, and the performances from all the cast. Costner more than holds his own as lead after surprising everyone with his energetic performance in the previous years espionage thriller 'No Way Out'. Andy Garcia put himself on the map bigtime and of course De Niro brilliantly portrays Capone in what is a small but vital role. Personally, Billy Drago is an unsung hero of mine growing up in the 80s and was great that he was rewarded with a memorable bad guy role in a big budget movie for once. If you're a student of 80s movies you'll recognize him portraying villains' in many movies like, Pale Rider, Vamp, Hunter's Blood and Invasion USA.I don't know! I think some people like to hate on Brian De Palma because it was trendy to at some point. No real substance to it other than the fact that De Palma was an outspoken fan of Hitchcock and didn't hide that fact. So critics labeled him as a hack, which I don't agree with. I love most of De Palma's work, like, Carrie, Dressed to Kill, Body Double, Scarface, Carlito's Way, Casualties of War, Blow Out, Mission Impossible and of course The Untouchables.Time has proven that this is a classic! So this is why I'm upgrading my score of 9/10 to 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Making The Most Of Blood, Smoke, And Fedoras","At the heart of the matter, ""The Untouchables"" is a comic book put on screen: Its characters are one-dimensional; its storyline abounds with convenience and cliché. But the full commitment of its principals on both sides of the camera makes this riveting all the same.Chicago in 1930 is a ""city at war."" A gang boss named Al Capone (Robert De Niro) holds court in a barber chair, explaining he is only supplying a need. ""What is bootlegging? On a boat, it's bootlegging. On Lake Shore Drive, it's hospitality."" But Prohibition is the law of the land, and when Capone's ways of breaking that law include blowing up buildings and killing little girls, it's time for U. S. Treasury Agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) to step in.Director Brian De Palma was slumming when he made this film, according to a DVD documentary. Maybe that was the secret; he didn't press so hard. The film exists as a series of set pieces, much like other De Palma films, and the attention to stylistic visuals and atmospherics are there. But this time he lets the story breathe a bit more, giving you something to care about or laugh at between what amounts to an exhausting amount of carnage.How bloody is this film? There's one cast member listed in the credits as ""Gunned Head."" Good luck finding him, too.Iconography is everything in De Palma films. Here he not only quotes from other directors, but develops some iconography of his own, like a famous moment when Capone expounds at length about his love for baseball and another when Ness is told about ""The Chicago Way"" by an older cop named Malone (Sean Connery): ""He sends one of yours to the hospital, you sent one of his to the morgue."" One shootout scene in a railroad terminal managed to both quote a famous film (""The Battleship Potemkin"") and become uniquely famous on its own.The body count is matched only by the cliché count. Every pavement is slick with rain. A dying man imparts important information to a friend with his last breath. A couple of bottles happen to be standing on a building ledge just so they can explode in sequence in the middle of a gun battle. Ness actually tells someone he'll see Capone in hell.Many reviewers here criticize Kevin Costner as Ness. Actually, I think some of them criticize Costner as Costner, which would be fine with me except for the fact he's very good here playing Ness as unblinking straight arrow with a touch of vulnerability. Connery won an Oscar for his role here, and while he's quite good, I think Costner delivers a better performance. He has to stand up to the star power of both Connery and De Niro and does so, allowing them the big moments their characters require but keeping himself at the center throughout. I even like Costner's smaller moments here, like eating a sandwich and trying to make small talk with a young cop during a stakeout.I do wonder why screenwriter David Mamet has him talking like a robot at times, but I like how Mamet keeps the story focused on the action, which De Palma supplies brilliantly. There's some questioning of the wisdom of cracking down on something as uncontrollable as people drinking booze, and even a darker thread involving Ness's being tempted to pursue extra-legal methods in pursuit of his aims. Still, when you have such wonderful bad guys as De Niro's Capone and Billy Drago's ultra-creepy button man Frank Nitti, it's hard to stop and ponder the deeper philosophy at work, which is part of ""The Untouchables'"" strength. You just want to see these guys die nasty.Also great in this movie is the music by Ennio Morricone, which stirs you up before you see a single character and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the end. Yes, there's something simplistic at the heart of ""The Untouchables,"" but it works so well I was left wondering if that stripped-down quality isn't the secret of its success.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Riveting take on the old TV show,"I have seen many movies, and while The Untouchables is not the best movie of all of them, it is one I enjoyed enormously. There is so much to recommend it and I found it great to watch. The story is riveting and well constructed, and while he doesn't show off as such, a good thing in my book, Brian DePalma does let loose with some very inventive not to mention bloody set pieces. See the climax at the railway station for instance, while essentially a nod to the famous Odyssey steps sequence in the Battleship Potemkin, it was brilliantly done all the same. Speaking of DePalma, he does do a wonderful job directing.That isn't the only reason why the Untouchables was such a hit with me. There are many more reasons. The dialogue is like crackling fire works, it is witty, intelligent and sophisticated, and some of it goes by surprisingly quickly. Ennio Morricone is one of the finest film composers ever, his score here is no exception, as it soars very like an eagle in full flight. And we have some truly sparkling production design, I love films with beautiful sets, scenery and costumes and The Untouchables scored highly in this area. Then we have very strong acting, Kevin Costner mayn't be to everybody's tastes but I think in his star-making turn he gave one of his better performances in this film. Andy Garcia joins the team with enthusiasm, and a plumped-up Robert DeNiro as Al Capone is wonderful as always. However, in my opinion, as the Irish cop who shows Costner the ropes, Sean Connery one of the most charismatic actors around gives the best and even perhaps most memorable performance here.Overall, a wonderful film, with an awful lot to recommend it. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Flawed Potential,"In any sensible scheme of things The Untouchables is not a Great Movie - but it somehow does attract serious attention. We want it to be a good movie - it has a big name crew and Serious Intent written all over it - but it fails. It doesn't fail badly - it fails in small, sad ways that in themselves are hardly noticeable, but which in the end just mount up to an unsatisfactory experience. De Palma wants to be a better director than he is - he uses intentionally ""interesting"" camera angles and movement. And just sometimes he can make a powerful sequence like the shoot out in the railway station. That the very effective minimalistic approach to this sequence came about through budget cut restraints, and that he borrowed heavily from Hitchcock, doesn't take anything away from the scene's effectiveness - though it does take away from any claims to De Palma's ability as a director. De Palma's wannabe serious pretensions drag this movie down and hold it from ever taking off into the thrilling action picture it wants to be. Mamet's script holds potential - it is a dark and somber script. When given to an actor with presence, such as Sean Connery, the dour, mean, repressed and aggressive nature of prohibition Chicago is fully explored. But the script is flawed. The sequence in Canada should never have been shot. The characters could have been better drawn and given more life and, well, character. But there was potential there that a good director would have exploited. Costner is wooden. De Niro is limited. Garcia says little. And Martin Smith is ugly in big glasses. It is only Connery and Bradford who do well. The set design gives everything a comic book feel. But not on the dark Gothic scale of Batman - no, this is more like Doonesbury. Take little snippets here and there, give it a fast edit with lots of Sean Connery, and you have a great trailer. But sadly the movie does not live up to expectation.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Terrible disappointment.,"This movie was horrible and I don't understand what all the fuss is about. I heard that it was supposed to be something great (having Robert De Niro as Al Capone seemed very fitting, but he only had about 10 minutes of screen time.) Far too much time was spent focused on Ness and his wife, which I saw as totally irrelevant to the story. Also, Kevin Costner's acting was terrible, as always; Ness' 'team' was extremely lame, and the scene with the baby on the staircase was just asinine. Malone's death was the most ridiculous overly dramatic death scene I have ever seen and was to this movie what Billy Preston's ""You Are So Beautiful"" was to Carlito's Way: The rock-bottom part of the film; (except for the fact that Carlito's Way was actually halfway decent compared to this hyped up garbage they call a 'good film'). I don't know anyone who's seen this movie, let alone liked it, but I would like to seriously ask anyone who has how they could ever watch this and enjoy it.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
depalma at his best,"The Untouchables is easily Brian DePalma's most accessible piece of filmmaking.  It is beautifully filmed and photographed and Mamet's screenplay is sharp and to the point.  Although this movie isn't necessarily considered one of DePalma's personal films (e.g. ""Dressed to Kill,"" ""Body Double""), it is still, nevertheless, extremely well-crafted and never seems to be overcome by DePalma's indulgent tendencies.  This telling of Prohibition-era Chicago, with Costner in the lead, boasts a tremendous performance from Sean Connery as the wise, old cop who teams with Eliot Ness to stop Al Capone.  Some viewers may note the obvious lack of historical accuracy, but no one can doubt the pure craftsmanship and beauty of this period piece.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great mob movie from Brian De Palma,"The Untouchables is a slick looking, action packed crime epic with a great ensemble cast of up and coming actors(Kevin Costner, Andy Garcia) and veteran stars(Sean Connery, Robert De Niro). The film is taken from the perspective of law enforcement and as such Kevin Costner really shines in his 1st leading role as Elliot Ness and has excellent chemistry with Sean Connery as an old and uncorrupted police officer. This is a period film taking place during the prohibition era in Chicago. Mob kingpin Al Capone is played by none other than Robert De Niro and while he does'nt have a lot of scenes in the film, his scenes are memorable and De Niro is perfect in the role. The film is pretty violent and bloody, but not gratuitous in any way. The Untouchables holds up pretty well and has great camerawork and outstanding performances.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Mamets finest,"I grew up on ""The Untouchables"" and as a slice of cinema it was one of my earliest memories of true directing and style - watching De Palma's famous train station sequence used to always leave me in awe, but it wasn't until I was older that I understood and recognized some of De Palma's trademarks. Looking back on ""The Untouchables"" now I view it as a different sort of movie - it seems somewhat less operatic and more of a tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top, exaggerated mob movie with all of De Palma's typical touches.But then again, it isn't. Because this is really the second of two times only that De Palma has totally proved to audiences that he's able to construct a masterful thriller/drama _on his own_ without copying (or ""referencing"") Hitchcock. ""Blow Out"" is a good movie, as are many of De Palma's others, but ""The Untouchables"" and ""Scarface"" are arguably the only two he's made where it's really a De Palma movie, and not a De Palma-Hitchcock homage.""The Untouchables"" seemed a lot better when I was younger but it's still a classic and due to my fond memories of it I'll probably always have a soft spot for it. However I do now recognize flaws I didn't used to - De Niro's Capone, for example, is a great portrayal but given awkward screen time...it works as a sort of convenient interlude to Costner and co.'s adventures - Costner kills some people, flash to De Niro yelling ""I want his head!"", flash back to Costner...it's not exactly a perfect balance as many of it just seems out-of-place...De Niro is wonderful but would losing his scenes harm the film? Not much. Instead, studying his character more would have been a wiser choice - De Palma could have easily made a three-hour epic that studies both men's stories and motivations and as a result the overall story would have been much stronger and the film better.As it is this is sort of a ""Godfather Lite"" - it's not an incredibly strong film, it has some flaws, it could have had ideas expanded, but at the end of the day it's a really great piece of entertainment with some marvelous set pieces, convincing performances and a legendary and iconic turn by De Niro, who totally steals the show from everyone else.The baseball speech scene is a classic - that's the type of stuff that makes me wish they had spent a bit more time focusing on him along with Costner, rather than just Costner.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great Movie Marred by Problematic Soundtrack,"I would echo what many other reviewers have said: it's a wonderful American story, portrayed by some excellent actors at the height of their talents. Sean Connery, for one, is very impressive and believable as an aging, jaded policeman, still walking the beat, who rises to the challenge of bringing down the Chicago Moonshine Mafia. Kevin Costner is also very good as the slightly naive, but pure and steadfast, representative of the US Treasury-though he nearly always comes up just a hair short as a leading man, due to his slightly annoying voice (a characteristic much improved in recent years, thanks to the gravitas of age). Bob De Niro in any role is always a terrific pleasure: nuff said.What keeps this film from being a truly great period piece is the amazingly bad soundtrack that plagues it from start to finish. I don't know if this musical disaster felt relevant and interesting back in the '90s, but it's very difficult to imagine a decade where Ennio Morricone's schizophrenic, incoherent approach was appealing or understandable to anyone! How unfortunate...",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Compelling acting & music,"The plot's pretty good, the staircase scene near the end with Costner & Garcia is one of my favourite in cinematic history, but what sets this apart is the screen enormous presence of DeNiro and Connery being DeNiro-ish and Connery-ish, Costner being well-cast, Garcia's semi-controlled brashness, and Charles Martin Smith's curiously lovable role.All that with the backdrop of some of Ennio Morricone's finest soundtrack-writing.It's a gut-wrencher every time I watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Flashy Period Yarn Unable To Touch On A Historical or Emotional Level...,"This huge production has been called a ""re-evaluation"" of the lame TV series and according to the end credits, it is fictitious.  Sure, there was an Eliot Ness, but history tells us he was not the reserved man Costner plays him to be.  History also tells us Capone did not fall this way.  Anyway, THE UNTOUCHABLES is brainless entertainment, a film that looks and sounds great, but doesn't have any emotional payoff to look forward to.  There are no glaring declarations of victory over Capone because prohibition was soon to be gone and De Palma and co. throw a last line from Ness at us to make everything okay.  Check your intellect at the door and just accept this for what it is.  A pulsating, slick vehicle for some big stars with an outstanding performance from Sean Connery.UNTOUCHABLES has the De Palma touch: slow-motion scenes, crooked frames, and some fine overhead shots.  Robert De Niro is merely a walk-on as Capone. His opening scene is great, however, his performance is nothing more than a brief blend of his other gangster roles with lines like: ""I want 'em DEAD! You hear me, I want 'em DEAD!""  It is almost self-parody.  Costner assembles ""the untouchables"" through a chance meeting with tough Irishman Connery (who won an Oscar), a completely lifeless Andy Garcia (not his fault - the writers gave him nothing), and an accountant played by dopey Charles Martin Smith who has no problem grabbing a sawed-off shot gun and raiding a liquor deal without hesitation.  Costner is his usual dull self, but Connery is no doubt worth watching.  In fact, he holds the film together, barely.There are some brutal scenes, but the standout is the now famous ""Odessa-step"" sequence in the train station.  Rewind and watch a couple of times and you see a prime example of great choreography, set-up, and editing.  It is an outrageous and impossible sequence, but it is visually rousing.  (Look for a deadpan spoof of this scene in NAKED GUN 331/3)  The scene, of course, is inspired by the revolutionary step romp in the classic Russian silent BATTLESHIP POTEMKIN.  Credit must be given to the set designers who have replicated Chicago, 1930.  It is a great looking picture, almost comic-book style.  De Palma is a master of technical design and overblown Hitchcockian filmmaking which sometimes takes away from the actor's ability to perform.  They are often overshadowed by the grandeur of it all.I am being very critical because I expected a lot more.  It is worth witnessing, especially in its wide-screen format.  You never get the sense that anything plausible is happening and Costner does not have the presence here to carry it all.  Thank the makers for thinking of Connery.RATING: 6 of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great performances along with touching scenes make this movie what it is.,"The Untouchables is a movie based on the true life story of Al Capone and the cops who eventually brought him to justice.  While often over the top and hard to believe, it's an overly enjoyable ride through 1930's Chicago and the problems with prohibition that ran rampant at the time.  However, if your're looking for a more mob themed movie, you'll most likely be disappointed.  Most of the shots are detailing the cop's point of view, and not much more.The cast and acting performances couldn't be better, in my opinion.  Costner stars as the determined Elliot Ness, the man that started it all.  He is pretty much the 'leader' of the team.  Sean Connery, who is by far the best performance, plays Jim Malone, a tired but wise character who turns out to be very likeable by the time the movie is up.  Other important characters include Al Capone (Robert De Niro), George Stone (Andy Garcia) and Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), who all do a fine job.The score could've used a bit more work, but other than that, I recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A gangster movie for people who find ""The Godfather"" too heavy","This is technically a brilliant film, a fictional account, with some elements of truth, of how gangster Al Capone was brought to justice. I say that it is technically a brilliant film because it is very glossy, very Hollywood and ticks all the boxes; a director at the top of his game, a star-studded cast and a large budget. The script is flawless in that it gives the viewer just what they want. It is a gangster movie for the people who find ""The Godfather"" too heavy and ""Scarface"" too violent. If one or two scenes were omitted from ""The Untouchables"", it could almost be classed as family viewing.That is not to say it is a bad film. Quite the contrary, it is brilliant. De Palma knows what he is doing; this is coming from a man who would brought ""Scarface"" to the screen only a few years before this, and who would then go on to direct the gritty and violent Vietnam War film ""Casualties of War"" two years later. But for me, it just does not hold up when it is invariably compared to other films of its genre, and when it garners such a high rating and acclaim from critics and viewers alike, then it draws more attention to its shortcomings when held in the same light as ""The Godfather"", ""Scarface"", ""Goodfellas"" etc.Sean Connery won an Oscar for this film. He is brilliant in the film, no doubt about it. But the character was average, and as a whole it was hardly Oscar-worthy. It was evidently a bad year.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
A great crime-drama,"This is definitely Brian De Palma's best film, and an ultimate crime movie. Sean Connery shines in his Oscar-winning performance, and this could also be Kevin Costner's best performance.  This is definitely a must-see movie that I strongly recommend!",,Anonymous,Crime
"Not 'Untouchable', but still better than many better films ...","Paraphrasing Jimmy Malone, I would say that Brian De Palma's ""Untouchables"" fulfilled the basic rules of cinematic entertainment. But when a film had so many natural predispositions for greatness, this isn't saying much.First, the strengths. The costume design and the restitution of the 30's Chicago is so authentic that some beautiful panoramic shots make you feel like traveling back to the prohibition years, on that level, the film is the triumph of meticulous perfectionism and sense of detail conceded even by the most virulent detractors. The direction works, though trying sometimes to impress with unnecessary dizzying shots. De Palma, after all, proved to be a great director for such intense films as ""Carrie"" or ""Scarface"", with his unique ability to oscillate between calm and suspenseful moments to extraordinarily effective outburst of bloody violence, conveyed by the beautiful part-thrilling part-haunting score by Ennio Morricone. The movie was handled by professionals who knew their business and had everything to be one of the best.But it needed one thing: a script, a kick-ass one with the guts and the energy that Oliver Stone masterfully injected in the veins of ""Scarface"". The movie had the heart but not the passion, the instinct but not the soul. You know something is wrong when you can predict a line or a reaction, when the Mounty Police chief expressed his disagreement, I saw the ""You're not from Chicago"" coming, and even the last line, a damn good one, had the forced look on that journalist's face as if he was thinking ""God, what a bad-ass, that Elliott Ness!"" By the way, that journalist had a strange ability to point his nose at any convenient occasion until he became an annoying running gag. Still, despite some embarrassing wastes of good lines, it's easy to put that into perspective.In fact, the script sinned more on the characterization and storytelling department, it lacked that spicy something that elevates and develops both the characters and the story in a symbiotic manner. Take Elliott Ness, played by Kevin Costner, more than any inner quality, he certainly owes his appeal to his pretty boyish look and his belonging to the right side of the right side of the law at a time where most of Chicago's police officers were on Al Capone's pay-roll, and the scenes involving his wife and daughter didn't even help. His combat against Al Capone lacked this tormenting desire or internal conflict that would enrich Ness' personality and erases this 'civil servant'-type devotion to duty. At the end, he exuded a sort of naive vulnerability and 'boy-scouts' innocence, that I ended up rooting for him. He was like the kid who wanted to be the hero ... but I didn't snob the pleasure to root for him, especially the film made it clear that it didn't intend to be a masterpiece.Now, to the shadowy guy on the poster's top. The trailer starts with ""Robert De Niro is Al Capone"", this sentence enough probably helped to guarantee half of the movie's success : one of the most respected and bas-ass actors at the peak of his career, portraying the most iconic gangster. De Niro was the 'AL'ibi for his antagonist's dull-Ness, but the trailer was still misleading. I love De Niro but he was too comical for such a serious film, and I can't think in all seriousness that he really expects us NOW to take this role seriously. I try to repress some aberrations my eyes witnessed, like a villainous grin in his face while reading the news of Ness' first flop. Though every actor is allowed to some mistakes, we can't blame everything on the script. But let's not be so severe, the movie had the villain and the hero it deserved, one over and one under the top, canceling out each other's negative effects through an improbably harmony. Both were interestingly nominated for AFI's Top 100 'Heroes and Villains' list, no need to mention that neither was selected.But these considerations hardly matter for despite all these technical faults, the movie kind of redeems itself once we mourned the masterpiece it could have been and start enjoying an innate greatness hidden beneath these campy elements. The pillar of ""The Untouchables"" is without a doubt the scene stealing performance of Sean Connery as Jimmy Malone, and I don't even care of the accent. I'm not supposed to tell between Scottish and Irish accents (well I do, but he could as well have had a Cuban accent), I hate to kill my enjoyment of a film for such superficial and so-called purist issues, especially when it's not significant to the plot. Connery had the best lines, the best scenes, and was the true leader of the group. Honourable mention by the way to the other untouchables : Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace and Andy Garcia as 'George Stone"".The other highlights of the film occur in many unforgettable scenes, one featuring a dinner table and the other, a train station, proving De Palma's directing ability to create suspenseful situations with the patience and talent of a craftsman. The film proved that for the depiction of cinematic violence, De Palma deserves more than a honorable mention. So I guess people went hard on his film because they expected much more, because he had everything to make a masterpiece out of the Prohibition, and avenge ""Once Upon a Time in America"". I simply hope that those who criticize ""The Untouchables"" for being over the top, campy or laughable, start looking at ""Scarface"" with a more serious eye and realize its greatness in comparison.Anyway, if the movie is victim of the Costner syndrome, as becoming the cool-to-be-hated thing, it also became one of the most famous gangster films ever, despite or thanks to its flaws, who knows? ""Miller's Crossing"" is certainly better on every level, but I sure will watch ""The Untouchables"" instead, anytime.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Old School Chicago,"Upon its release a film critic commented that calling The Untouchables the best gangster film since The Godfather II is not saying much. As there have been hardly any good gangster films since Coppola's sequel.Brian De Palma known as a visually interesting but flawed director got a rather campy television series and made a bravado film filled with his visual touches. It is inspired by his love of Hitchcock and meshed it with an artful gangster thriller scripted by David Mamet.Kevin Costner plays the boy scout Elliot Ness in Prohibition era Chicago who is initially humiliated. After meeting beat cop Malone (Sean Connery) he assembles a team of Untouchables to take down Al Capone (Robert De Niro) for tax evasion.The film looks terrific. De Palma excelled in the art direction, the stage setting, costumes and photography. There is a bombastic and at times cheesy score by Ennio Morricone (just hear those sentimental tunes each time Mrs Ness appears.)Yet the film hits bulls eye despite some hokiness. De Niro plays Capone as camp and loud. Each appearance is a set piece, whether he holds court with the press, cries at the opera or beats someone up with a baseball bat.De Niro apparently had each hair in his head individually plucked in order to have Capone's moon face look.Sean Connery dominates as the Irish cop Malone teaching the street smarts to the green Ness on how to take down crime 'the Chicago way.' Yet this is a cop with a Scots accent and who can forget the line: '...brings a knife to a gunfight' before being shot a thousand times.Andy Garcia gives a star making performance as the cool rookie and sharpshooter George Stone. Charles Martin Smith almost steals the film as the meek agent Oscar Wallace whose idea it was to go after Capone for tax fraud.There are spectacular set pieces such as the homage to Battleship Potemkin with the pram and baby descending down the steps.The film is a good blend of action, humour and violence that stands up as a classic 30 years later. De Palma makes sure that the violence is not as overpowering as in his previous gangster film Scarface. He behaved himself here and this is probably his most accomplished film.De Palma would once more return to adapt an old television series in the 1990s when he made Mission Impossible a film series that still continues to this day.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Does what it's supposed to and entertains!,"Is this entertaining? Sure. It's however not particularly realistic, whilst it is overly dramatised. Not in the way of extravagance such as a Scorsese movie, but rather in that many of the key characters (Capone especially) are at practically all times putting on a frantic macho caricature of a show. The bad guys are overall not very deeply portrayed at all - we learn that Capone makes a murderous living in the illicit liquor business (surprise surprise). And the good guys, although enduring far more screen time, receive a marginally more realistic portrayal of their work.Where I do think this movie shines is in the chemistry among the ""Untouchables"". Costner & Connery especially is one to be remembered for the ages. And Connery overall carries this movie on his shoulders with his charisma.

Al Capone's True Story,"Let me try to systematize this matter on one-to-one basis. The film ""Untouchables"" (1987) is based on true story. Unlike Mario Puzo's ""Godfather"" saga which is fictional but alas paragon for gangster history - i.e., here the only true fact is the village Corleone, 35 km from Palermo then, and now suburb of that city in Sicily. On the contrary, the life and times of Al Capone as ""notorious figure"" in American society from the first half of 20th century has become somewhat blurred. I have watched at least 10 Capone's movies and most of them are hilarious. Conversely, ""Untouchables"" (1987) keeps value with time.Starting with David Mamet's brilliant script, suggested by book from Eliot Ness. The latter is real time figure though not highly instrumental in the conviction case against Capone. His profile from Wikipedia reveals a honest FBI official who wouldn't accept ""1,000 $ notes on his desk every Monday morning if he turned a blind eye to bootlegging activities ..."" Essentially, it was President Herbert Hoover who monitored Capone's trial through Judge James H. Wilkerson and U.S. Attorney George E. Q. Johnson (those are photos from Library of Congress recently published in book format). Capone is flanked by his two lawyers but at end he defended himself alone, carrying law books at the courthouse and knowing things not going well for him. Famous trial was that 1931 case.On aggregate Al Capone seemed victimized but he was product of the Great Depression. The biggest criminal of America also endorsed election for Chicago's Mayor Bill Thompson in 1927 and organized free soup kitchens in town. He was a huge Sports Fan and attended horse races on regular basis. He was married to Mae Coughlin, deeply religious Catholic, and have one son - Albert Francis ""Sonny"" Capone. He did have two scars visible on his left cheek, etc.I wish to tell further the story of organized crime in America but it would take lot of time. Fragmentary periodization outline three main periods:1/ Outlaws and Bandits after the Civil War. Those work on ""the Quick and the Dead"" rule being rather marauders and looters. Most died chased from posse or by Pinkerton detectives;2/ Organized Crime as Strictly Business. This evolved after Great War, mostly ruled by second generation immigrants Italian, Irish and Jewish. Their legacy is infamous and they jacked America as top destination for crime;3/ After World War II came the Mafia, the Cold War and then the Jihad. This is the story where crime and politics go hand-in-hand right into the 21st century ...",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

I'm so sorry to say,"I'll preface this by saying that I'm not typically in the habit of ""calling"" anything out, especially a film, but it has just come down to that.So I purchase a lot of movies before i've seen them, typically based on praise I'd formally heard or read, or a film whose concepts just gripped me from a trailer or a brief synopsis. I've purchased plenty in this style, ""Requiem for a Dream"", ""Blue Velvet"", ""Goodfellas"" and ""Scarface"" to name a few.

Enter Malone, an aged cop who has been weathered down by all of the agonizing distress and pain caused by trying to fight crime in such a corrupt place. Malone takes Ness under his wing and together they recruit two more men to their group, a group which will attempt to bring down one of the most significant figures in the history of organized crime.So I went in to the film imagining a dark and gritty noir type of film, with great characters, powerful performances and epic scenes of a great city struggling to reclaim itself in the wake of depression. None of that was present. Instead what I had stumbled upon was an obviously set-shot film for it's majority, something which I find sincerely weakens the tenacity of the opening scene in the bar with the little girl and in other places throughout.Something which let me down was Kevin Costner's single-dimensional portrayal of the man who vows to bring down Al Capone. But really, what did I expect from him? He did ""Waterworld"". His naive character who goes through a whirl of transformation from a good, wholesome officer of the law to a ""no holds barred"", ""Do what must be done"" cop couldn't have been any more poorly executed. A character who holds so much truth and sees and experiences so many things that change his psyche was just not present. It wasn't there. It just happened. It was all over and he was still the same. No one should be the same after dealing with what he has. Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia's roles are minor in the film and they way in which their characters were developed (or underdeveloped for that matter) is yet just another fault.Al Capone. It couldn't have been hard trying to figure out who should portray this man. Robert De Niro has been a godsend to any filmmaker wanting to depict organized crime. Who better to play a young Vito Corleone? Where would Scorsese be if not for De Niro in ""Mean Streets"" and ""Taxi Driver""? And he does it again with magnificence. He IS Al Capone. He's nice but he's unforgiving. He's innocent until proved guilty. He executes his role so powerfully that you wish the film was told from his perspective instead of the good guys. He makes the movie real and what lets me down with his role is the mere fact that he is only in it a few times, and when he leaves you want more.The great Sean Connery received an Oscar for his role in this film and I can't disagree with that decision any stronger. I'm not saying Connery is a bad actor, on the contrary, i think he is a spectacular actor, he can make you laugh, or make you want to be a spy or really just kick some ass. But he doesn't make you want to hang out in Chicago. He's just there. Now I don't blame Connery for his characters seemingly strong lack of involvement, I blame poor direction and shoddy writing. His character was one of great strength, the only ""good"" cop left in a sea of corruption, but his time has passed, he doesn't want that dangerous life anymore, but he gets back into it because it's the right thing to do. Think of all of the emotional turmoil, the INNER turmoil that could have made his character more powerful and subsequently enhanced Costner's character as the man following his example. Just a shame.The music was another thing that let me down. That and some of the boring, ""made for TV"" style shots create a lack of depth in the heart of the picture. I never feel like I'm in Chicago, I never feel that I'm watching one of the most important things to happen in 20th Century US history, I feel like I'm watching a PG movie with more blood than normal so they upped it to R. I'm going to stop now while there is just so much I could say.But don't let me bring you down. It's premise is great, it just wasn't what I was expecting. As I watched the movie I saw a better one with each shot, with each clichéd line being changed, just so slightly, darker, more emotional, more in the vain of what DePalma did for ""Scarface"". It can be better, and hopefully someday it will be.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
A classic retelling of history,"First i have to say that I am a huge De Palma fan and this movie is one of his greatest creations. We've all seen Scarface, Carlito's way... but none of them has this spice which blows you away like The Untouchables. The acting is great. The only thing the p***es me of is that the movie didn't get any oscars for it's directing.This movie is the best since the Godfather (9/10)",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
An epic movie beyond the narrow boundaries of film genres,"I am not sure if this is De Palma's best work. But most definitely, it is one of his most rousing one, packed with a great ensemble cast (greatest for any of his movies) backed up by a solid screenplay, great camera work and masterful editing. It is a rare crime and gangster movie that set its moorings very wide and deep into moral and religious righteousness. And it is that very mooring which lends the movie a very credible emotional base and connect whereby we share 'the untouchables's feelings of despair, joys and triumph. This film also brings out De Palma's versatility in ample abundance and shows that he is equally adept in showcasing drama and action-piece set on an epic scale (for example the scene at the US-Canada border) on screen as much as voyeur-driven suspense and pulpy thrillers. The climax scene (another greatly set action set piece) at the railway station bears Brian De Palma's stamp all over.Sean Connery is extremely charming as an honest competent and resourceful cop whose performance clearly stands out. Kevin Costner is good while Andy Garcia and Patricia Clarkson provides credible support. However it is Robert De Niro leads all of them with a short but nevertheless the most menacing gangster role that he has ever portrayed. It is a very physical role and he clearly had a great time playing it.But apart from all of the above, it is an extremely engaging and entertaining movie which will be equally absorbing to the serious and the non-serious viewers and followers of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The best gangster film I've seen,"In my opinion, ""The Untouchables"" is the best gangster film I have seen. While I love the inside look of the Mafia seen in ""The Godfather,"" I enjoy this film so much more. ""The Untouchables"" manages to entertain rather than simply tell a story. Also, I like looking at a gangster from the point of view of the police (the good guys) rather than from their own point of view, as this is a more typical way to see the bad guys. Kevin Costner, Andy Garcia, Charles Martin Smith, and Robert DeNiro are all great, but it is Sean Connery as Malone (in an Oscar-winning role) that really steals the show. The film proves to be somewhat funny as well as dramatic, which gives proper balance and causes the audience to enjoy the movie more. It tells the story of how law enforcer Elliot Ness (Costner) and his team of ""untouchables"" try to bring down mob leader Al Capone (DeNiro). The film is full of emotion, as well as humor, and manages to satisfy its audience. Almost a perfect film, and a classic for sure.**** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Connery's comedy.,"Notable because Sean Connery actually attempts an accent other than his own, however badly and however briefly.

Great Movie Except for the Usage of the Score,"You can see where this movie can be criticized. Some of it is warranted, but not all of it. Seeing this movie recently for the second time refreshed my experience and had me realize that my biggest gripe with it is the score, which is so over the top and cheesy at the worst times.The one scene in particular where it just does not fit is the bridge shootout: as the good guys are riding their horses up towards the bad guys, the music is so loud and obnoxious in the corniest way. Remarkably, the scene is actually very good, but the music turns what would be a gritty and even more intense scene into some kind of heroic, melodramatic celebration of these mighty men of honor taking out the bad guys.Other scenes also have it wrongly placed and times, and it just made me think of how the movie would be better served without the score blaring overdramatically at many of the best scenes. It really would be better and probably less manipulative and more realistic. Other than that, I think this is a very good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Above average gangster flick...,"The Untouchables follows Elliot Ness, a treasury agent who arrives in Chicago with one goal - to arrest notorious crime boss Al Capone. Thing is, Capone is very good at covering his tracks and has his people everywhere - including in the police. So Ness assembles a small uncorruptable unit to take him down once and for all.I must admit I'm somewhat on the fence about this. Despite being a decent actor, I'm not a massive fan of Costner, and Connery for me just didn't fit in this film at all. Robert De Niro was great though, despite having minimal screen time, and Andy Garcia was great as the rookie marksman. Despite being well shot, the film is just too... clean - it looks like a film, if you know what I mean? The middle section on horseback felt... odd and the soundtrack again just didn't fit. I know Ennio Morricone has done some phenomenal work in the past but this just felt a bit phoned in. I dunno... I mean it's alright but I'd never rush to watch it again.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
De Palma and Mamet craft a brilliant gangster picture with modern day sensibilities.,"A commercial and artistic high point for director Brian De Palma (""Blow Out"" ""Dressed to Kill"" ""Scarface"" ""Femme Fatale""), working from a script by David Mamet (""House of Games"" ""Glengarry Glen Ross"" ""Heist"" etc.) and featuring Kevin Costner in his breakout star making performance as prohibition era crime fighter Eliot Ness. There's little historical accuracy to the film, but who really cares about that when there is so many other things to love about the film. Besides the above mentioned assets, you have an incredibly strong cast led by Coster as an idealistic Ness, who's joined by honest beat cop Jim Malone, a wonderfully over-the-hill Sean Connery, a rookie cop recruited straight from the Academy who hasn't been corrupted yet (""If you're afraid of getting a rotten apple, don't go to the barrel. Get it off the tree."") played by a young Andy Garcia (""8 Million Ways to Die"" was his only other major credit before this), and capped off by Robert De Niro packing on a ton of weight to play Chicago gangster Al Capone. Incidentally, De Niro started his career with director Brian De Palma well before he made ""Mean Streets"" with Martin Scorsese, so it's a treat to see the two reunite. Besides the strong leads, you also have Charles Martin Smith, Richard Bradford, Billy Drago, Patricia Clarkson, Del Close, and even Clifton James (the tobacco chewing sheriff from ""Man with the Golden Gun"" and ""Live and Let Die"") all in memorable parts, so it really is a cast to die for. In addition to a sharp script, an amazing cast, you have some serious talent behind the camera that includes cinematographer Stephen H. Burum (""Rumble Fish"" ""Carlito's Way"" ""Hoffa""), composer Ennio Morricone (""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" ""The Mission"" ""The Hateful Eight""), set decoration by the guy who's everything from Disney's ""Mary Poppins"" to ""Back to the Future,"" and the editor of ""The French Connection"" ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Scarface,"" but the real hero behind the camera is director Brian De Palma. The sets, costumes, music, and overall period atmosphere are amazing, but it's the visual stylistics from De Palma that make this film a classic. Without spoiling anything, the Pagliacci scene and the Sergei Eisenstein inspired baby carriage scene are moments of pure cinema (meaning they are scenes that would be impossible to capture or recreate as effectively in another medium. Not written word, not painting, not stage play, not graphic novel, etc.). Although a major studio film, this is unmistakably a Brian De Palma picture. ""The Untouchables"" is minus his usual obsessions around voyeurism and sexuality, but the film does have his trademark fascination with violence (""They pull a knife, you pull a gun. He sends one of yours to the hospital, you send one of his to the morgue. That's the Chicago way!""), guilt/betrayal (most all of the characters are motivated by some form of guilt), as well as his many visual hallmarks (camera zooms, slow motion, and memorable POV shots). De Palma's fingerprints are all over the film, especially the ""Battleship Potemkin"" inspired train station shootout with a baby carriage bouncing down marble steps amongst a hail of slow motion gunfire. According to Mamet, the scene was not in the original script and was added by De Palma, but this particular scene ends up being the most memorable of the film. It's De Palma's signature suspenseful build-up that makes the scene so effective. In lesser hands, this 10-minute sequence might have been a straight forward shootout, but with De Palma it achieves operatic levels, with about a dozen moving parts all contributing to mounting suspense as he turns the screws on the audience, stretching out about 10 seconds of real time action into a two minute slow motion action masterpiece. Whether it's a bucket of pigs blood above Carrie's head or Tom Cruise trying to catch a bead of sweat, De Palma builds suspense better almost anyone. What makes ""The Untouchables"" different from many of his other films is its emotional center, which comes from an earnest performance by Coster and Mamet's carefully plotted script. Many of De Palma's films seem at times mere exercises in cinematic stylistics and explorations of his various obsessions, but his best films have an emotional center, which I would say are ""Carrie,"" ""Blow Out,"" ""Casualties of War,"" ""Carlito's Way,"" and this film. Overall, from the the stylish opening credits to the soaring finale, ""The Untouchables"" doesn't have a single false note. This is the film that De Palma will be remembered for and deserves to be recognized as a true American film classic. SIDE NOTE: Rewatching the film 2018, I was struck by how ""1980"" this otherwise very authentic looking period film seemed. I had a hard time putting my finger on what made it seem such a product of it's time, but I think it came down to the cinematography, with the use of hazy lighting, but still, I'm not quite sure what made this period picture seem so 80s.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Untouchables is excellent with a great choice of casting and a terrific performance by Sean Connery as Jim Malone, which earned him an Oscar for his work. Scarface director Brian De Palma directed at his best once again and made this extremely enjoyable.

Not historically accurate but Brian De Palma's Untouchables is a well made and unforgettable gangster film,"Last time I watched The Untouchables was back in 2017, I have wanted to re-watch it for a while now and this was the right opportunity because of the sudden death of Sir Sean Connery. Seeing this movie for a second time makes me appreciate it even more, of the masterpiece and how memorable it is.The Untouchables is based on a true story, it's about Eliot Ness who's played by Kevin Costner and the squad he forms called Untouchables and their goal is to take down Al Capone that is brilliantly played by Robert De Niro. The ensemble is rightfully cast as everyone shines in their roles, it's one of the reasons why this is a movie you could re-watch multiple of times. This film is directed by the talented Brian De Palma and written by David Mamet, De Palma is a natural when it comes to making gangster movies as he have showed it with this film and Scarface, the vision he has and the direction he gives to the actors is amazing. There's also some great cinematography in this moving picture, with the camera angles and overall work mixed with the incredible sets just makes the immersion so much higher. The costume department was fantastic as well, truly capturing the 30's in Chicago. The musical score is another highlight in the movie, one of Ennio Morricone's finest works.I want to talk about the acting in this film, there's a lot of well known names. Like Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, Robert De Niro and Andy Garcia. Sean Connery felt like a father figure to most of the cast, and so was his character to the others in The Untouchables. His performance gave him an Oscar for best supporting role, I don't know who else was nominated but if was a great performance but nothing really mind-blowing but worthy of it. Robert De Niro captured the character completely and delivered on point, great performance. Kevin Costner also gave one of his best performances but Sean Connery stole some scenes.The story of Eliot Ness and his Untouchables is an interesting one, a story you will find both entertaining and interesting. There's something for everyone, action sequences or drama. Many memorable character interactions and moments across the 120 minutes, a perfect length that will keep you satisfied and entertained from start to finish.

I'm not too concerned with historical facts and what not, but I am concerned with the craft of film, which I might add, this movie has none of.  All the characters are flat, one dimensional, and we really don't gain insight on any of them.  Sean Connery was only there to make some cliche remarks now and then, hardly an awe-inspiring performance. The music is the first dismal quality I noticed about this film, right after the cheap Hitchcock knock-off tracking and POV shots.

It's rare the cast is just as legendary as the historical characters they are playing,"The Untouchables (1987) is a movie that I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on HBOMAX. The storyline follows Chicago during prohibition when American law enforcement found it virtually impossible to bring down Al Capone. Eliot Ness is asked to lead a task force to bring down the legend. He will assemble a unique cast of characters in hopes of bringing down Capone by any means necessary; and best believe, Capone won't make it easy.This movie is directed by Brian De Palma (Scarface) and stars Kevin Costner (Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves), Sean Connery (Dr. No), Robert De Niro (Heat), Andy Garcia (Ocean's Eleven), Patricia Clarkson (Shutter Island) and Brad Sullivan (Slap Shot).Everything about this movie is entertaining. The storyline is tremendous and who doesn't want to watch a movie of Eliot Ness versus Al Capone? The characters are so compelling. It's rare the cast is just as legendary as the historical characters they are playing, but Costner, Connery and De Niro are an unbelievable ensemble. The backdrops, attire, props and depiction of the era was also perfect. The depiction of the tommy gun was very cool and the baseball bat ""team"" scene was legendary. The shootouts at the courtroom were classic Hollywood fun and the ending was rewarding.Overall, this is a fun rendition of the Eliot Ness versus Capone battle that is an absolute must see.

"De Palma's refined visual style and his great performances make this a great moment in cinema in the eighties, exploring a heavier genre in a fun way achieving absolut success","The United States Prohibition, which lasted from 1920 to 1933, was a period in which the production, transportation and consumption of alcoholic beverages were prohibited throughout the North American territory. It is in this context, more specifically in 1930, that ""The Untouchables"", a film directed by Brian De Palma, takes place. The plot follows Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner), a federal agent who arrives in the city of Chicago to combat the illegal sale of drinks, which is designed and commanded by boss Al Capone (Robert De Niro). After a failed seizure attempt, the newly hired police officer decides to put together a team to fight against the sale of alcoholic beverages - a team formed by Jim Malone (Sean Connery), George Stone (Andy Garcia) and Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith). Together, the four men form a group that comes to be known as the Untouchables.David Mamet, a renowned playwright in theater and cinema, writes a script that is extremely simple and cohesive, manufactured to raise money at the box office, which in fact ended up happening. It is common for a large part of the public to be excited by the film, but these reactions are explained by the way in which the script and editing constantly work on the dichotomy that governs the film and divides it into two nuclei that continually walk side by side, crossing and observing each other. Se: literally, good and evil. If on one side we have an irritatingly kind protagonist - to the point that his wife is excessively benevolent and understanding - on the other side we have the opposite extreme, embodied by the character Frank Nitti, literally the face that represents Al Capone in his actions against the police. In the name of this stylization, part of the staging seems to want to escape realism and its characters are caricatural in several ways - notice how Andy Garcia's character, at several moments, reacts excessively in the background, gesturally - and the narrative, as well, becomes almost stylized, a typical tale based more on mythical aspects than reality, or the opposite of what current hero films seek.This caricatural tone helps in defining these opposing cores and in the construction of the characters, whose character and behavior can be expressed in the first scenes in which they appear. It is not surprising, then, that Mamet works into his script to create a strong sense of family unity around Ness. The strong - and perfect - family base that he brings from home is continually reinforced to also explain the strong sense of family unity that forms between him and his men, creating a parallel that clearly exposes the environment that he seeks to recreate in his place of residence. Work, after, from the beginning, discovering that he cannot trust anyone.It is also impossible to ignore that ""The Untouchables"" builds a structure that literally resembles a Western: a lawless city, where the sheriff is dominated by the rich rancher, until the arrival of a man - or more - who challenges the status quo. Force to impose the true law. Not surprisingly, even the four cowboy-policemen on horseback are captured by De Palma's lens, in a scene that seems designed to celebrate this inspiration from one of the purest genres in American cinema. If in structural and narrative terms De Palma dares little and bets on solutions designed to hook the public without complicating this process in complex unveilings and subplots, stylistically the filmmaker, even though he is also daring less, still demonstrates some hallmarks of his cinema that demonstrate his way of see the plot follow-up. De Palma, like Spielberg, for example, is a master at constructing sequence shots that excel in subtlety, rather than display - like the one in ""Serpent Eyes"", which asks to be noticed - in addition to long shots that minimize the use of cuts and seek to immerse the public. Even though the director rehearses some sequence plans that, at other times, he would certainly construct, and sabotages them in the name of more conventional solutions, it is still delicious to see how DePalma explores the picture - whether to build, with the presence of the four police officers in it, the impression of group unity, or to explore the characters' relationships in the environment without having to cut.""The Untouchables"" is a less authorial film, but it still retains its director's stylistic marks. The scene in which Malone elicits information about Capone's accountant from his surprising source, Police Chief Dorsett, is an example of this meticulousness: director of photography Stephen Burum, who had previously worked with De Palma on ""Body Double"" and would later work with him in six other films, he shares the screen with blue lighting on one side and red on the other. If it is under the red light that Dorsett threatens Malone with death, foreshadowing the character's fate, it is no surprise that in the next movement Malone pushes his opponent from red to blue, when he manages to extract from him the confession he is waiting for. See also, for example, the way in which the director chooses to stage Wallace's death, in a brilliant, subtle and little-noticed sequence shot: we begin by following the public prosecutor's improvised press conference and, from there, DePalma constructs a long shot. Sequence in which the camera alternates its attention to different characters that pass near it. From the prosecutor, we move to Wallace, Stone and the prisoner, following them to the elevator, where Nitti's presence is revealed.When the elevator door closes, he turns to the side, follows the woman who appears to have helped him infiltrate to meet the prosecutor speaking to the press, and then be abducted by the presence of Ness and Malone, accompanying them into the elevator. Corridor for a long distance - where, in fact, there seems to be an internal joke, when Ness says that his son will be called ""John... John James"", looking and smiling in a complicit way at Malone - Sean Connery was, after all, the first ""James"" Movie Bond. Even after this scene, the fluidity remains: when they hear the shot, the camera follows Malone and Ness to the stairs, but does not go down with them. He chooses to remain in the corridor, and turns his attention to the police chief, then following him to the window, from where, in plongée, we see the murderer leave through the back and discover the chief's betrayal.The director, in fact, also abuses ""unconventional"" movements, such as the camera that circles the table with the four untouchables or the traveling shot that comes out of the window where Ness and Wallace talk about Capone's tax and reveals that they are on a plane. At another moment, the camera works as the point of view of the intruder of Malone's house, leaving the viewer glued to the chair until the scene's violent outcome. De Palma is also competent in directing spectacular sequences, such as the shooting on the border between the USA and Canada, where - accompanied by a great soundtrack - the editing alternates very well between the different shots, making the sequence even more exciting. And, obviously, he demonstrates his talent in the best scene of the film, during the spectacular sequence at the train station (a beautiful homage to ""The Battleship Potemkin"", from 1925). The slow motion shows in detail the show orchestrated by De Palma, with the baby carriage slowly descending the stairs while the gangsters exchange shots with Ness and Petri, in a perfect ballet that is pure cinema.Despite the tense atmosphere, ""The Untouchables"" is not dramatically charged. Even so, it still has extremely touching and sad scenes, such as the death of Wallace, which exposes the corruption of the Chicago police once and for all, and the stunning death of Jim Malone. On the other hand, the group's exciting interventions in the drink trade and the grand finale guarantee the viewer a feeling of satisfaction. The final sequence, in fact, could not be less than sensational, starting when Ness, now powerful after obtaining the trial, appears gigantic on the screen as he leaves the court (De Palma also uses an angle that magnifies him on the screen). The clever script uses the match (""1634 Rancine"") as a way to indicate to Ness who killed Malone (in a device called clue and reward, which usually pleases the viewer), starting another great chase, even if it has small exaggerations (Ness misses a shot from two feet). And again, Brian De Palma's striking style appears, when after pushing Nitti (Billy Drago), the camera makes an interesting movement looking for Ness on top of the building. The exciting ending, with the change of the jury and Capone's arrest, completes the perfect conclusion of the narrative.""The Untouchables"" is a romantic film, in the sense of glorifying the integrity of the characters, however, without allowing a spiral of moralism or other forms of reduction. Eliot Ness's crusade against Al Capone's apparently unbreakable empire is the basis of an exciting, violent, reverent plot of the great cinema of the past, as well as exemplary with regard to Brian De Palma's skills. The human dramas explored in David Mamet's script are not subject to technique, the tricks that cinema uses to establish itself as an artistic medium, but are enhanced by them, modulated according to the frequency desired by the director, whether to highlight the adventure, success or even tragedy in the path of those who fight against the odds. De Palma's refined visual style and his great performances make this a great moment in cinema in the eighties, exploring a normally heavier genre in a fun way and yet achieving absolute success.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Exaggerated But Entertaining,"Just like with every Brian DePalma film, The Untouchables is brimming with style, but what sets it towards the top of his work is all the other aspects as pretty much everyone involved is a top name in their field. The script, probably the tightest of any DePalma film, is penned by David Mamet who's attention to the time period and setting keeps him from going full Mametspeak. The cast is headlined with Kevin Costner, Sean Connery and Robert Deniro-where lies the best piece of the film. Costner fits his role perfectly and DeNiro hams it in the best way, but Sean Connery is ultimately the best thing here, in a performance he richly earned the Oscar for. This doesn't even touch upon Ennio Morricone's score (or even the costumes by Armani). Everything in the movie is a bit exaggerated: the action, the sentiment, performances etc. But still succeeds if you swallow it as pure cinema.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Powerful Gangster Drama!,"""The Untouchables"" is arguably Director Brian De Palma's greatest film. He managed to assemble a top drawer cast to tell his story of Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) and The Untouchables quest to stem crime in Chicago during prohibition and bring down crime kingpin Al Capone (Robert De Niro).Eliot Ness is appointed by the FBI to coordinate efforts to stop the corruption and crime in 1930 Chicago. His first raid is a disaster, the crooks having been warned by corrupt police officials led by Police Chief Mike Dorsett (Richard Bradford). Ness despondent over his failure has a chance meeting with honest cop Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery) and asks him to join him. Reluctant at first, Malone eventually decides to join Ness' crusade. FBI accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) is assigned to Ness and discovers that Capone hasn't paid any income taxes for several years. Rounding out the team is gung ho police rookie George Stone (Andy Garcia).When Ness refuses a bribe form a city alderman, the alderman gives the group it's name, ""The Untouchables"". The group begins to raid known liquor warehouses with great success. Capone meanwhile, disciplines one of his men with a baseball bat. The boys, with the help of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) foil the smuggling of bootleg liquor across the border. Malone's ""questioning"" of one of the crooks is memorable.Capone now begins to take Ness seriously and orders him killed. Wallace is gunned down while transporting a prisoner. Malone learns that Capone's accountant, who has all of the names and places of public officials on the take, will be leaving town by train. In one of the film's most memorable sequences, Ness goes after the bookkeeper. As the shooting begins, a baby carriage with a baby inside begins to roll down a steep staircase and....................................Although Kevin Costner made a convincing Eliot Ness, he was up against some powerful performances. Connery literally steals the picture as the honest Irish cop. He won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his efforts. De Niro eats up the screen as Capone ans Charles Martin Smith is excellent as the accountant turned G-Man. Andy Garcia was just emerging as a major player and holds his own with this high level talent.At the border crossing sequence, Ness refers to the leader of the Mounties as ""Captain"". I would be remiss, if I didn't mention the fact that there are NO Captains in the RCMP (there's called Inspectors) and they don't all speak with Englisg accents....and they DO have police cars.One of the all time great gangster pictures.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Unwatchable!,"This is director Di Palma's big budgeted highly fictionalized account of Eliot Ness and his team going after Al Capone to get him convicted and sent to prison.Future bad movie king Kevin Costner is a bland and unconvincing Ness who shows not one wit of charisma in the role.Sean Connery is good-but not too convincing as the Irish American cop,and Andy Garcia-as the Italian American cop is probably the best thing this mess can give us. Di Niro as Capone seems to be doing a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit in a role that he was probably paid big bucks to do.The scene at the dinner when he makes those corny baseball analogies before caving in the skull of a fellow gangster with a baseball bat is thoroughly predictable and seems to be a leftover that never made its way into the equally bad ""Scarface"" a few years before this.This is not really a movie in the conventional sense. It plays more like a series of unrelated episodes strung together. It looks too clean, too perfect, kind of like a Hallmark greeting card.Di Palma-who practically made a career by ripping off Alfred Hitchcock eschews the Master this time and directly rips off the Odessa Steps sequence in Eisenstein's Potemkin when the baby carriage with its over age passenger rolls down the steps of the railroad station in the highly stylized gun fight, a sequence that you see coming before it actually happens. There are corrupt juries, gun duels, knife fights and more classic cars than you can shake a stick at, but these elements do not an engrossing film make. The overall amateurish quality of this film sabotages it from the outset. All you can do is stare at-and hope to get something meaningful from it. Shame on you David Mamet for this screenplay! A total waste of time. As they say in Brooklyn.. Forgeddaboutit!",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""THAT's the Chicago way!""","far and away my favorite De Palma film, ""The Untouchables"" remains one of the great gangster/corruption movies. I can't imagine it hews all that closely to historical fact, but it makes for great entertainment; exciting when the heroes make gains, heartbreaking when they suffer (horrific) losses. There's some nice camera work in this movie and the train station scene is a masterclass on unbearable suspense. And even though Costner fits well in the noble crusader role, it's Connery who really steals the movie. Seriously, he's on fire here. And all of this works in utter spite of that awful score.Great movie.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Rousing, grand filmmaking........","In the mob, crime drama sub genre, I think that with all of the great films such as The Godfather films, Goodfellas, and other highly regardimed films The Untouchables gets sort of left behind. It is different from some of those more nihilistic,violent films but it is a grand, elegant take of good vs evil with the fictionalized story of how Elliott Ness was able to catch Al Capone. Director Brian De Palma and screenwriter made every character in this film larger than life. Some might say that the film isn't very deep and I have to agree that it isn't. It doesn't want to be. It wants to be a rousing film about taking down one of the most notorious gangsters in history and as that it works.Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
This Movie Is Untouchable!,"An old-school kinda goofy gangster flick is never what you think it would be when there is a remarkable filmmaker like Brian De Palma behind the camera. Alongside with Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Untouchables proves that old-style action movies is far from being dated. In fact, they are nothing but timeless.The Untouchables is a deeply entertaining cop/mob movie. But what made it stand the test of time, besides its A-List cast, is its unique, and exceptional direction by none other than Brian De Palma. There is no shortage of De Palma's trademarks and his own visual style, nor his way of creating the tension that shouldn't be considered far behind Hitchcock's. But I don't think I've been shocked so many times in a movie before like here. The Untouchables's zany humor and wackiness can't make you think for a moment that it can be so brutal like that. It's like you know you're watching a PG-13 movie then all of a sudden comes a ruthless scene filled with gore and blood.But what impressed me the most in this movie is how Brian De Palma simply could made us think ""The Untouchables"" are very touchable, and their mission is impossible to be done just by showing us a scene featuring the pure evil, Al Capone. De Niro's lunatic over-the-top performance was more than enough to make the viewers feel worry as much as the titular team.The issues I've with this movie are with the silly and ridiculous nature of this movie. Yes, this very thing that I've praised above. Because halfway through the movie I think De Palma went too far making the movie's tone so absurd and ludicrous that you have to turn my brain off, while the movie didn't ask me to do so. Especially when the movie contains some very serious and emotional moments that worked so well on their own. So I felt there is a lot of inconsistency, and the tone could have been balanced way better. That being said, I enjoyed the entire movie even its brainless moments.It would be unnecessary to mention that all the performances are superb. But Kevin Costner's performance helped flesh out his character, Eliot Ness. Speaking of which, all the characters are well-established, and have enough depth to serve the plot and to make you care about them.The end is a little bit rushed, and could seem implausible for some. But I think it makes all the sense looking back on all what have been established throughout the movie.The Untouchables is not Scarface, but it offers a genuine entertainment that can't be resist. Can't wait to see more of De Palma's work, let alone Domino that will be released later this year.(8.5/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Enjoyable Film but Confusing Stylistic Choices,"The movie is enjoyable there's no doubt about it, but at times it feels like it doesn't know what it wants to be. Sometimes it comes off as shtick and cliche where it can appear cheesy, but then it immediately redeems itself with intense and serious conversations between De Niro/Costner or Connery/Costner. Connery definitely shines in the film and deserves the Oscar but the movie often takes itself too seriously and can confuse the viewer on what style De Palma is actually going for.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Untouchables is good old fashioned gangster fun.,"Harking back to those classic films where henchmen are firing tommy guns on the streets of Prohibition-era America. There are loads of films depicting this time in history, but not all of them are nearly as fun as this. A federal agent vows to bring down the legendary kingpin Al Capone where an experienced police officer teaches the agent how to beat the mob. It's just the classic story of good versus evil. Law against crime. The beauty of such a simple premise allows the ability to have rich characters and an absorbing world. The production values are off the charts, this truly felt like Chicago and the costumes were authentic. Whilst the story as a whole is not particularly memorable, the film is built up on set pieces to keep the viewer enthralled. A great example would be a shootout in a train station where a baby in a pram is slowly falling down some stairs. That, is what I will remember. Acting was solid all round, Costner and De Niro were great however it was the legendary Sean Connery that made me smile. He is such a natural talent on screen, his charisma just shines through instantaneously. The character Eliot Ness' development was well executed where he starts to take the law into his own hands towards to the end. I would've liked to have seen Al Capone being used more in the film, but I fully realise that he got his henchmen to do the dirty work which is fine. Also admired one scene where Brian DePalma switches to a POV shot of a man sent to kill a police officer. Slyly moving throughout the house, I thought it was a creative method. The level of violence is hit and miss and sometimes borders on cheap but for the most part it was gritty and exciting to watch. The Untouchables is definitely one of the most entertaining films of its genre and I can easily imagine myself watching it again soon.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Aged Very Well,"This film made a huge impact as a teenager when it was first released. I remember talking about it with my biology teacher. I was bad at biology, but she was one of the few teachers at the school who really took an interest in her pupils and formed relationships with us. I remember telling her how much I'd enjoyed 'The Untouchables', and her replying 'The best Western I've seen all year!'.She was right, of course. There's much of the Western about it, and nothing about it that doesn't work together as a whole to expertly crank the tension to levels that are at times almost unbearable. It's moving too, with fleshed-out minor characters and a real sense of the stakes as the situation escalates.My son, 19 years old with intellectual limitations, asked to watch 'a mafia movie' with me, and this was what I chose today.

Sean Connery's Finest Performance!,"Without a doubt, Brian De Palma's The Untouchables is one of the favorite movies to come from this decade. As someone who intensively studied the Prohibition era and the legend that is Al Capone, I knew this film would be up my alley. Add in Brian De Palma as director and Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, and Robert De Niro as the film's leads, you cannot go wrong right? In my own humble opinion, that is correct. I really loved the film so much, I was surprised to see how many lukewarm reviews it received (although it still received generally high marks from critics and regular folks alike).
Why does this film speak to me so much? Firstly, the film has an authentic look and feel. The streets of Chicago were perfectly embroidered with 1930's era cars, clothes, buildings, etc. The costume design from Marilyn Vance is impeccable, along with the production design of the sets which was put together by Hai Gausman. I loved the shiny, sleek feel of everything. Secondly, the man behind Dressed to Kill and Scarface was behind the camera. He brought the same kind of energy and style to this story. Some critics complain the film is stylistic...well, yes it is! De Palma's style. Thirdly, the performances especially from Sean Connery are fantastic! Say what you will about Connery's accent, but he nailed the role of Jimmy Malone. Fourthly, Ennio Morricone. Need to say anymore?
The film was written by David Mamet, who at the time was a famous playwright. His script has been criticized by his peers for not containing a point or anything meaningful to say about the story. I think the script is conventional and that is a good thing the story is told that way. His script also contained from powerful, masterful lines of dialogue. When Malone is offering his services to Ness for the first time, I loved his line about how Ness just made a blood oath. Also, individual scenes work incredibly well. The shootout at the bridge on the Canadian border is an all-timer. That scene exhibited incredible amounts of energy and I loved what Connery did to one of Capone's dead guys. You'll notice what I mean when you watch that scene.
Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is a young, incorrigible treasury agent who wants to take down the notorious gangster, Al Capone (Robert De Niro). With most of the police force in Capone's pockets, it will be a very hard if not impossible task for Ness. He receives some much-needed help when veteran, hard-nosed Irish cop, Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery) pledges his help to take down Capone. He does warn him that once he begins the war, Capone won't stop until they are all dead. They realize they have to be mindful in their recruitment, so they hire academy cadet George Stone (Andy Garcia) and IRS agent Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) to join the team. Once the war begins, Capone finds himself unable to touch these men hence the term ""The Untouchables."" Violence is used from both sides, but there could be something called tax evasion which may be Capone's ultimate downfall.
The performances are excellent and well-rounded. Connery and Costner had excellent chemistry together. The film heralds the beginning of the success Costner would have for the next 7 or 8 years. His character is self-serious and wants to work within the law, but Costner kept the role of Ness from being too dry. Connery is the real winner here, and his performance gave him his only Oscar. I loved his gritty, hard-nosed attitude ready to kill at any moment. Despite his Scottish accent being entirely too noticeable, I can set that aside because his performance is just too darn good. I am surprised I could call De Niro's performance underrated, but people do not give as much credit to his hammy, showy performance. He certainly hams it up, but he is certainly having fun playing this historical legend. He actually gained thirty pounds for this role, which certainly gave him an interesting look. Finally, Garcia and Smith delivered fine supporting performances to round up Ness's team.
The Untouchables is not only a violent story about the takedown of Capone, who was in charge of Chicago's booze during Prohibition, but it is also a story about redemption and relationships. This is one of the reasons why the film was able to attract more female viewers when it was showing in theatres (I believe it was a 50/50 split). Morricone is a music legend, and he crafted another memorable, uplifting score. He can manipulate my emotions all he wants. The look of the film is historically accurate and gorgeous. Sean Connery stole the show with one of his best career performances. I loved learning about Al Capone and the movie tells the story in a stirring, beautiful way!

"Brilliant, just plain brilliant.","There is something about Zuit suits and Thompson machine guns that naturally attracts me to these types of films. However, knowing full well about the subject of the film, and the fact that it's widely praised pretty much everywhere, I needed no gimmicks to get my attention. This based-on-a-true-story film about a group of law-enforcement agents, led by Eliot Ness, is made up of four men who join up to stop the flow of crime and illegal booze from Al Capone.While the actual group had nine men, this premature depiction of the team is made up of some of the best acting I've seen. While I'm not the biggest Costner fan, I think this was one of his best performances. He basically nailed the by-the-book, good-hearted hero role on the head, flawlessly. Still, the one thing that makes this film one of my all-time favorites is the spectacular performance by Sean Connery as the racist, old-school street cop, Jim Malone. His rugged sense of humor and course actions give the film a certain charm that couldn't have come from any of the other characters. Oh, I can't forget De Niro, though. If there was one person who was meant to play a gangster or mob boss, it was De Niro.The main thing that surprises me about this film, is the fact that it fallows that cliché ""path of the hero,"" with Costner as the timid hero, receiving his call to action and Connery as the disgruntled mentor, pushing and guiding the hero along. What's surprising, though, is that this film still finds a way to make itself seem intriguing in a whole new way, as if to not even copy that formula.

Enjoyable hogwash,"It's some time since I read truthful accounts of what happened in Chicago at the time, but I think I would be prepared to bet that virtually nothing in this movie actually happened the way it is presented, if at all. I don't think Elliott Ness killed a single man, for instance - certainly not someone as well known as Frank Nitti! Nor, I think, did Capone have any cops or Treasury officials killed, let alone witnesses in custody (it caused enough trouble when he had a journalist killed).So, watch this for what it is, a sort of modern western with about the same relationship to the facts as most westerns about historical characters. It has lots of enjoyable action, tremendous shootouts, some humour (I liked the accountant going wild and blowing gangsters away right and left), moral dilemmas, etc. and great performances by DeNiro and Drago.

Good but overrated,"`The Untouchables' is a solid movie, containing great performances from Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, and Robert De Niro, with more than adequate performances all-around. This film contains a well-known, excellent premise, successfully played-off the classic TV series. I raise my glass to David Mamet for an excellent screenplay that encourages these strong performances.I have one complaint, and it is massive. Between second-rate director Brian De Palma and above average screenwriter David Mamet, the film is given moments too intense to be remotely realistic. The oft-praised `Odessa Steps' shoot-out scene is ludicrous in content, and the bridge shoot-out isn't much better.

The #1 Movie Disappointment of All Time,"Even more than the first STAR TREK movie, THE UNTOUCHABLES was the biggest letdown of any movie ever. Both films were based upon brilliant and widely popular television series (by Desilu Productions), and each was highly anticipated by fans of those programs for many years. THE UNTOUCHABLES was the slickest piece of TV action drama that had ever been done. Besides the brilliant production design and the inspired idea of having Walter Winchell doing a voice-over narration, was the fine-tuned development of each and every character in the Eliot Ness Untouchables Team. By giving us a strong sense of their background and motivation we understood exactly why these men were ""untouchable"" that no bribe, death threat, intimidation, or anything else could deter their objective to bring down the mob.Brian dePalma's limp and pathetic imitation has the actors dressed up and saying, Oh, yeah! We're the untouchables; as they strut along like Sinatra's Ocean's 11. No character development or motivation to give any of them credibility. What follows is a travesty of a picture; including dePalma's ""tribute"" to Russia's director Sergi Eisenstein and his famous ""baby carriage scene"" in ""Battleship Potemkin."" Equally pointless in Potemkin as in Untouchables, a runaway baby carriage just rolls right along, down a long outdoor flight of stairs, cutting thru the action. In Potemkin, it was silly enough; but in Untouchables, and knowing dePalma is doing his artsy-wartsy ""tribute"" it only raises one more howl to the parade of nonsense going down.I'd have paid ANYTHING to see this movie: $20, $50, whatever.

Great movie,"Chicago. The first half of the 30s. The times of Prohibition. The local mafia under the leadership of Al Capone (De Niro) continues to rule in the city. The government creates a special team with the catchy name ""Untouchables"" to fight Capone and his empire. At the head of the brave is the young and energetic Eliot Ness (Costner), the soul and the main thinker of the quartet is Jim Malone (Connery), the best shooter and sympathetic ""gang"" is agent George Sloane (Garcia), as well as a local nerd and a specialist in financial fraud - agent Oscar Wallace (Smith). Together, they are destined to put Capone behind bars and destroy the business of one of the most famous bandits in history.Even strange, but three gangster epics (Scarface, the Untouchables and the Way of Carlito) The De Palms received only one Oscar nomination (the only statuette for Connery's career for ""best supporting actor""). So much is felt now the ""format"" of these paintings by Brian and the stupidity (or blindness) of American academics. Of course, Coppola and his ""Godfather""annoyed all his colleagues. Francis, who is Ford, raised the bar of quality to such an unattainable height that all gangster films woven not ""in a Coppolovian way"", it seems that they are immediately sent to the Oscar basket (it is enough to recall Scorsese's "" Nice Guys ""with a single statuette and Scott's"" Gangster"", which remained without awards).And De Palma, meanwhile, is not at all like a friend of Coppola, because his "" Untouchables ""(like"" Scarface ""and"" The Way of Carlito"") is a much more personal picture than the same""Godfather"". And, of course, less academic. Here the viewer's attention is turned to the person, but not to the system. In the frames of faces, human emotions. De Palma is not afraid of close-ups, as if forcing us to make eye contact with the hero. And eye-to-eye, like Sherlock Holmes, using the deductive method, we begin to understand the laws of gangster Chicago, the formulas, rules and axioms of the criminal world. In Coppola, the main characters, despite all their character, are just cogs of a huge, long-established mechanism. Almost conservatives. And the mafia world, according to Coppola, does not tolerate deviations from its clearly defined line, just as it does not tolerate Individuals trying to unravel a criminal ""blanket""woven for years. In De Palma, all the heroes exist outside of a given coordinate system - and Eliot Nes, who renounced honesty for the sake of a just cause, and Jim Malone, pushing Nes on the ""right"" path, and even Al Capone, a smart and resourceful bandit who managed to tightly crush the underground world of Chicago.

Yet that is not enough because we still need the central actors to carry the film if it is going to triumph. Connery is a given performance wise (accent aside of course, but then again who cares when the character portrayal is as sharp as it is here?) but it is Costner as Eliot Ness that shines like the star he was soon to become, it's a magic performance that manages to fuse genuine tenderness of family love with little trips to the dark side in pursuit of making good triumph over evil.I love that the film is showing how violence and fear affects families, mother and child is a theme that is central to the film's heartbeat, notice how some of the more violent scenes are followed by tender scenes of Ness and his family. The set pieces here are attention grabbing entertainment, a roaring Canadian border rumpus and a smashing roof top pursuit and face off are top value, but it's DePalma gold watching a brilliant Battleship Potemkin homage at the Union train station that takes the cake as the film enters its last quarter. Surely historical facts does not matter when films are as sharp as this one is? It's frightening, touching, and even witty. So for me at least, the film is 10/10 in every department (and yes, even with Sean's accent).Footnote: The academy saw fit to nominate Ennio Morricone for his wonderful score, yet strangely he used some of it for the main theme in John Carpenter's 1982 film The Thing, they must have missed it that time I presume! Must be the genre angle one thinks.... I really like me this movie. Thanks and regards.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Gangster Starter Movie,"Not one of the best gangster films though it is a very entertaining and exciting film. This movie just structures a whole a new genre of gangster entertainment, it's a very gritty film and I'm not that disappointed with the directing. ""Scarface"" is much more accurate than this film and simply not a good assemble of a plot. The good news though is that I'm very impressed with the score, the score embodies more of heroism, very cheerful I can't express. The score positively distracts the whole acting of this film on what's going on. The screenplay is decent, the acting I want to make a change. Just tho sum everything, I'm very fond with the movie its less grittier than Miller's Crossing and less accurate than Public Enemies.",,Anonymous,Crime

the untouchables revised and given a new treatment by Brian De Palma,"""The Untouchables"" is reckoned as one of the kingpins in Brian De Palma's filmography by the insiders and his devotees. I would tend to agree with them and to be conducive about this general contention with however certain reservations.This transposition of the well-known TV series is surely one of his less personal works. His obsessions with Sir Alfred Hitchcock take a back seat and we're quite far from the thriller genre with grisly, bloody effects which helped to build the filmmaker's reputation. Actually, ""the Untouchables"" appears as formulaic in the presentation of events: Chicago during Prohibition under the control of the underworld with its main leader Al Capone, here acted by Robert De Niro whose performance is however less startling than in ""Angel Heart"" (1987) by Alan Parker, released the same year. A young fresh FBI agent Elliott Ness (Kevin Costner) rises up against him and has a yearning to make him fall. After a failed police raid in Capone's warehouses, he teams up with a seasoned cop, Malone (Sean Connery) and hires a band of volunteers who share his same determinations and then their hopes soar. But some members are killed including Malone. This doesn't help Ness's men to arrest Capone's accountant and his financial registers...It's sure that De Palma wanted to remain as close as possible to the historic reality. It seems that everything in the film from the scenery to the making was recreated to capture the stifling atmosphere of the Prohibition and the spirit of the film noir in the thirties but the contents of the film is very classic as a whole. And it's often aggravated by a streak to excessive effects, one of De Palma's main drawbacks. Visual excesses which are mostly present in shoot-out and fight sequences like Malone's slow death. Ditto at another level for Ennio Morricone's majestic but overwhelming music. But once again and like in some De Palma's works, the rumbustious form compensates the contents despite bombastic tendencies. Three seminal sequences would deserve to be legion in the filmmaker's canon: the western sequence with the Canadian mounted police, Malone's death, the arrest of the accountant by Ness in a shoot-out sequence doubled with a wink to Eisenstein's masterpiece ""the Battleship Potemkine"" (1926).It's rather acceptable stuff but I favor Phil Karlson's terse style on the same domain with ""the Scarface Mob"" (1959).",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
spellbound,"Federal Agent Eliot Ness played by Kevin Costner sets out to nail Al Capone, played by Robert de Niro, the chief of rampant corruption in Chicago during the 1920s.

I Wasn't Impressed,"THE UNTOUCHABLES came out in an explosion of acclaim in 1987 with the critics hailing it as "" a masterpiece "" and "" An instant classic "" but after seeing the movie I was wondering if I'd been watching the same movie .My own theory as to why so many cynical movie critics liked it might have had something to do with the very poor standard of movies in the mid to late 80s which seemed to involve either teenagers getting killed in a variety of gruesome ways or a couple of well dressed cops pointing their guns while the billboard hot one hundred plays in the background . Off the top of my head I can think of only one movie from the same period that deserved much praise and that was PLATOONIt could also be remembered that THE UNTOUCHABLES has a great cast list with DeNiro , Connery and a couple of rising stars in Kevin Costner and Andy Garcia , but the screenplay fails to focus on any one character . You do get the impression that it has been re-written to death in order to accommodate the big name stars . Personally I thought Capone should have been the main protagonist with Ness in the background with tough wily Irish cop Malone absent altogether . Maybe that was the intention with the original script but it had been changed with the casting coup involved ? Sticking one or two factual elements into the story would have helped tooThe more De Palma movies I see the more repetitive his directing techniques become . Long panning shots , slow motion sequences featuring bloody deaths . It was good in CARRIE but had become old hat hereOh and if it was such a great 1987 release how come it didn't get a massive load of Oscar nominations ?",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

One of the Best Films of the 80s,"The Untouchables is a visually and emotionally compelling movie that effectively draws the viewer into the clash between Elliot Ness and Al Capone. It's unusual that this film has received so few accolades considering the number of stand-out acting performances and the numerous memorable sequences in the film.In the movie, Elliot Ness is determined to win the battle with his nemesis Al Capone and against corruption within the law-enforcement agencies. In order to do this, he brings together a group of men who can not be bribed or in other words, are untouchable. Sean Connery is excellent in his role of a veteran cop who tries to teach Ness what it will take to defeat Capone. Robert De Niro, as Al Capone and Andy Garcia, as a talented rookie cop, give good performances, and Kevin Costner gives a subtle, underrated performance as Elliot Ness.Brian De Palma's direction, although somewhat derivative, (Many techniques and film sequences were taken from earlier and foreign films) is very impressive.I highly recommend this film, especially if you are a fan of the Gangster movie genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

This, combined with satisfying well directed action scenes and a fantastic cast, make The Untouchables a truly must-see film. As a gangster film, it is right up there with The Godfather and other superb examples.

Timeless crime classic with a powerful cast and brilliant director.,"Directed by Brian De Palma, written by David Mamet, impeccable work from composer Ennio Morricone, and starring a powerful cast with Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, Robert De Niro and Andy Garcia, The Untouchables is still a fantastic movie 35 years on. Based on the TV series, it brings back the crusading lawman v ruthless gangster storyline set in the 30's. It's brilliantly made.During the prohibition era in the USA, gangland kingpin Al Capone (Robert De Niro) supplies Chigago with illegal liquor which has built up his empire. He is considered to be the undisputed leader of Chicago and rules the city with an iron fist. He also has all of the politicians and police in his pocket, and nobody dares to cross him. That includes his own men and other rival gangsters. Federal Agent Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is tasked to stop Capone and his supplies of alcohol. Due to the widespread corruption in the city, his efforts are hindered following a failed raid and he is left on his own. Ness decides to put together a small group of lawmen that are not influenced by Capone's corruption. The include the veteran patrol officer Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery who won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), police recruit George Stone (Andy Garcia), and accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith). Not only do they start to succeed in raiding Capone's warehouses full of bootleg alcohol and thwarting his incoming supplies, they also discover that they can also take down Capone on tax evasion. Ness and his men will not back down as Capone declares war.Brian De Palma did a fantastic job as director. David Mamet who wrote the screenplay was brilliant. Ennio Morricone is well known for his work in movies such as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1966), Once Upon a Time in the West (1968) and The Mission (1986). Morricone's soundtrack for this movie is impeccable. The cast is first rate. Kevin Costner's role as Elliot Ness is one of his best roles. Sean Connery deserved to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role as the aging beat cop Jimmy Malone. Robert De Niro was always brilliant and his role as Al Capone is one of his most memorable roles. Andy Garcia as the sharpshooting police recruit was excellent.The stairway shootout scene at the Chicago Union Station was and still is a memorable scene. The same goes for Al Capone's speech about baseball and wields a baseball bat during a meeting with his fellow gangsters. If you've seen the movie, I don't have to say any more. If you haven't seen it, you'll soon understand both scenes.The Untouchables is still a timeless classic. It was excellent viewing when I first hired it out on VHS back in 1997 and I've seen it a few times when it has appeared on TV. I bought it on Blu-ray several years ago and I still pop it on if I'm in the mood for an uplifting and powerful crime classic.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

De Palma at his best,"This a fine crime drama movie. Kevin Costner does a fine turn as Elliot Ness the man who would hunt down and take down Al Capone's empire. Kevin Costner does the role of his life in this and the only other thing by him that even comes close to this is The Postman. Sean Connery does good in this as an Irish cop who is trying to redeem himself. I believe that this is and was the turning point in Connery's career. Before this he was seen as a has been and had been type cast as James Bond, but this broke him out of that rut by showing that he had range. Charles Martin Smith is funny in this as he is in almost all of his movies. Can't wait to see him do something big again. Andy Garcia makes an early appearance in this as well and it helps the film as he is a good actor. But the real saving grace of this is Robert De Neiro. This is his forth collaboration with director Brian De Palma and it is probably their best effort together. Although I like Greetings a lot.

Wonderful looking myth,"The whole Al Capone tough guy killer persona was a public front, he was simply a low-level gang stooge with a fake resume, put forward to befuddle Chicago politicians and police at the time, by the real criminal owners and operators of Chicago's illegal liquor trade.They were the gangsters who crafted and then certified as true, the ridiculous stories of tough guy stooge Alphonse Capone.Look at pictures of the guy. Consider how stupid it is to be so high profile at a time that so many are being gunned down in the street. Why income tax crimes of all things? Why did the dope stick around and be convicted and sentenced and incarcerated, does that make any sense for a wealthy murderous mad-dog gang lord?Above all, once incarcerated, why instead of additional charges to prosecute hundreds of gangland slayings, do we get NO additional charges of killing or bootlegging, but instead an EARLY RELEASE, to Miami Florida? Why was tough guy Alphonse immediately set upon by fellow prisoners, and removed to solitary?Because he was a fraud, a stooge, given over for public consumption in the Chicago liquor rackets.And guess what, the IDIOT FEDS bought it, hook line and sinker! But by the time they figured out they had been duped, they were in too deep in the media and papers of the day, so they simply swept the thing under the rug...Income tax charges but never anything about killing or bootlegging?Early release from prison, because it simply compounds the FEDS IDIOCY to keep a stooge, a front and a fall-guy, in jail for things he never did.Nice story though, the myth is.

epic crime drama,"I had read many a rave review before seeing this film. Most of them commenting on the performances, the direction, the way that 1930's Chicago was painstakingly rebuilt...and the list goes on. Does it live up to the hype? well, yes and no.Basically, the story revolves around Elliot ness, who is newly appointed treasury officer, and his band of 3 other men (otherwise known as the untouchables) and their fight to bring down Alfonso Capone. And thats it. No beating around the bush, the story is simple. And that, for me is the films first failing. It is one of the few epic dramas which i felt could have gone on longer. There should have been more about Capone, and Chicago in general. I felt that it was just a bit...light. However, gripes aside, this is a fine piece of cinema which reeks of quality and is obviously a labour of love from every one involved. Every performance is brilliant, worthy of note are Kevin Costner, Sean Connery and Andy Garcia. The direction is as good as anything we have seen from De Palma, and shows that he is one of the best directors out there, easily a match for Scorcese, Cameron, Spielberg, etc. He packs the film with detailed reconstruction of Chicago, brutal violence and knows how to get the best out of his cast.My verdict? There is no doubt about the fact that this is a good film. However, i felt it needed something more. As period dramas go, Millers crossing had more style, Once Upon a time in America had more substance, and The Godfather...well, we all know what that turned out like!",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A very strange, bizarre film","Eliot Ness was no saint. He was a terrible husband, a drunk, and a failure at most things other than catching the criminals he pursued. But you'd never know that from watching this movie. The true story of the Untouchables, as written by Ness, was embellished with fiction before its publication a year after his death in 1957, fictionalized further by the TV show, and taken even further away from real life by David Mamet and Brian De Palma for this popular 1987 hit.In 1930 the Mob rules the streets of Chicago, spreading fear and violence wherever they find competition or defiance. Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner is his first true lead role) is the straight-up, honest, pure, incorruptible Treasury agent out to get him. Finding the local police filled with crooked Irish labor he keeps his group small, picking jaded beat cop Malone (Sean Connery in an Oscar-winning role), Fed accountant Wallace, and rookie Stone (Andy Garcia, also in his first big role). Together they go after big boss Al Capone, finding it rather easy to do so despite the fact that we never see any puzzle-solving, mystery, clues, or plot twists. Everything seems to conveniently fall into their lap, giving them nothing much to do apart from react and talk big.The Untouchables really does LOOK like a big screen epic. The lovely photography, period setting, and high-key production give it the feel of a classic, but the movie itself is hollow, flat, tepid, disorientating, ill-conceived, and laughably misjudged. I loved it when I was 7-years-old thanks to all the bloody violence, though watching it as an adult reveals it to be frustrating and weird. I am amazed that David Mamet wrote a screenplay this clunky. The man is a master of cryptic dialogue, and here, in a movie filled with gangsters who ought to be fast-talking and garrulous, every single line is so utterly basic and straight-forward.Even the moral difficulties of Prohibition (itself a moronic mistake by the US government) are gleaned over with no effort, care, understanding, no sense of irony or hypocrisy, no turmoil, and no inner conflict. De Palma is so busy shooting the ceiling with low angles it's like he only glanced at script once or twice without realizing how stilted and lukewarm it was.Ennio Morricone's wonderful score is the soul of this movie (and boy did it really appeal to 7-year-old me) giving energy and life to scenes that would otherwise be moribund. But even he doesn't know when to restrain himself, occasionally going over-the-top and spoiling things.The Untouchables is curiously uplifting, sporadically violent, and unfortunately over-praised. It fails on so many levels, though it seems that De Palma and Co. couldn't care less and were happy with the bizarre, confusing end result.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Had great expectations, but found it mediocre.","I believe the strong points of the movie are Kevin Costner (acting & aesthetics - both great), the costumes and the music (subtitles only - more on that below). Costner's character & acting was as sophisticated & captivating as I wanted it. The costumes were superb, and the theme (Ennio Morricone) was superb too and very suitable for that movie.Beyond these points, on a first level, I found the rest characters either not suitable for the story of Al Capone or the cast under-utilized. Robert De Niro could have been a guest-star here, completely under-utilized. Still amazing performance, but the director didn't give any depth or color of the huge Al Capone, zero serious dialogues, more like a caricature of Al Capone. Sean Connery's character was this of the misfit-cap, and although his acting was good (he is anyway great), I was not convinced he is suitable for this role, I just think he fits more bigger-than-life characters. Andy Garcia has close-to-none dialogues, plays more like the good-looking & all-in-style Italian (including shooting, the 1 of the 2 only elements of his character, the other was his good looks, honestly) - to the point that the close-up at the end of the film to his face for couple of minutes, really doesn't feel suitable considering his character.On a 2nd level, I was disappointed with the plot, I was expecting bit more about Al Capone, and the movie got more intense only on the 100'-115' - the rest was very mediocre, complete lack of depth of characters, few plot twists, no serious dialogues.As for the music, with the exception of the great theme (subtitles), the rest was not suitable (in my opinion) for an action-drama-thriller movie for the great story of Al Capone's case. In some parts, the music playing could very well be from ""Police Academy"", really...I believe the great cast and the big story of Al Capone contributed to my great expectations, but I guess this is the risk the director took here, and it doesn't always work for all audience.I would watch it again years later if I had nothing better to watch - but was not exactly memorable (for all the right reasons a least).This is a 6.5 for me, rounded 7.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Wasted watching, directed like a kids film.","This was a truly awful, lifeless excuse for a gangster movie. I have no idea why the thing is so critically acclaimed and rubs shoulders with masterpieces such as Goodfellas and The Godfather. The characters came across as two-dimensional, predicable half-wits who bared no semblance to any human being in a serious or emotional situation. The arrogant optimism and achievements of the protagonists gave the plot the endearing vibe of a children's summer vacation film, and this jarred with the unmoving and completely arbitrary occasional depictions of graphic violence.

For clarity's sake, this is not a bad movie, it's actually a pretty decent one but with all the perceived hype surrounding it I was expecting something masterful and it was fine, a bit better than fine even, but only a bit.What makes this is the cast.

overrated mafia-classic,"The Untouchables is about a friendly detective living in the 1930s, trying everything to bring down the legendary Al Capone. As the chances seem very low to let Al Capone, respective his corrupt friends, go to jail the sympathetic family father and detective brings together a diverse group of interesting, morally right people to fulfil his ultimate objective. While the interesting story is filled with great acting, by above all Oscar-winner Robert de Niro, as well as the other cast. Moreover the movie creates an exciting mix of moral questions and fear, due to the bad guy's threat to kill our main character's family and hardly good action sequences. The biggest discrepancy with the Untouchables is that the story is not at any point of time as tensioning as other great mafia films like Goodfellas. For that reason the movie fails to be one of the most tempting mafia thrillers.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

"If This is An Eight, Scorcese's Films are 15s","There are films that are ""good"" because the critics say they are. And there are films that are just... good. Like the most recent Johnny Depp travesty about another old time bad boy, ""TU"" was hyped like mad when it came out. Compared to it's principle opposition for little statues (""Moonstruck,"" ""The Last Emperor,"" ""Broadcast News,"" ""Fatal Attraction"") that year, ""TU"" is well-mounted fluff.The account of real-life Elliot Ness and his ""G men"" is so tortured it's barely recognizable. (This is, scene by scene, about as fictional as the late '50s / early '60s TV series of the same name.) There are no characters here, anywhere. Sean Connery's turn is cardboard, and this is not one of Andy Garcia's career makers, either. De Niro's portrayal is a direct lift from Rob Steiger's of the same character in a pre-De Palma version of ""Scarface"" called ""Al Capone"" (1959). Costner made more sense in ""JFK"" (which was another stretch).Compared to any of Curtiz's, Coppola's, Scorcese's or the Coen Brother's gangster epics, this is old school comic book stuff that looks pretty thin stacked up against work like ""Public Enemy"" (1931, not 2009), ""Angels With Dirty Faces,"" ""The Roaring Twenties,"" ""The Godfather,"" ""Miller's Crossing,"" ""Goodfellas"" or ""Casino.""But I can understand why it works for some people: Big-name stars, good production values, manipulative tear-jerker scenes when good guys are killed, retribution and revenge, bullets and blood spraying. At that sort of thing, De Palma really was a ""master"" of lowbrow shoot-em-up.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hollywood s heavy weight cast made  it a block buster explosion,"A film by Bryan De Palma which brought Kevin Costner, Robert De Nero and Sean Connery really made it to the limits. In a sense this subject matter become so powerful with the high performances of the actors who did maximum justice with their characters. Robert De Nero was most impressive in my view as the real life don Al Capone, while Sean Connery 's portrayal as Jim Melonie warned him Oscar for best actor in supporting role. Then comes Kevin Costner as Elliot Ness federal agent appointed by the authorities to gather real evidence against Capone and also to eradicate corruption in the premises of the police department and some related law enforcement agencies. To accomplish the mission he requires the selfless assistance of Jim Melonie who is a senior and experienced cop , he is the only one who knows how to beak into the web and network AL Capone made over the years. While also they asked for the services of a young , enthusiastic but a courageous officer played by Andy Garcia. I saw the film when i was 18 in that stage most people like either full action or supernatural horror movies but this movie at that time made a place in my heart. Its all because of the competition which the actors did with each other on the set , because of their effort i really went mad to watch it. The other credit goes to director Bryan De Palma , i also happened to see his Scarface , a very intense violent but a good crime drama. Great job done by all of you.

One of the most enjoyable crime films out there,"Didn't expect to enjoy this so much, but ""The Untouchables"" is a wonderfully directed film with a strong cast - especially Sean Connery as many have said before - but Kevin Costner also brings in a great performance as his character transforms from a wide-eyed cop ready to follow the law and into someone who goes a bit further... it's a good arc that does falter near the end though.Speaking of the end, that is the weakest part of the film, it just doesn't successfully land it in a fully satisfying way, but that has much more to do with the script. Robert De Niro's Capone is charismatic but feels quite seperate from the rest of the film.But these flaws struggle to matter when everything else is firing on all cylinders. Brian De Palma directs multiple classic sequences, Ennio Morricone's score elevates many scenes that sends a small chill, and the script's focus on characters pays off extremely well as the film continues. And the film is only about 2 hours, which is uncharacteristic for a crime epic like this, but it welcomed.An easy recommend for just about anyone, it's a terrific film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Ala Brian De Oalm,"I consider Brian De Palma to be one of the best directors and every time I watch a movie of his (Carlito's Way, Scarface, Carrie etc) that consideration comes true. ""The Untouchables"" takes us to the corrupt Chicago of 1920 during the period of Prohibition, where the Al Capone's (Robert De Niro) empire was dominant. But the federal agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) has put as a goal of his life destroy him. To his side is Jean Malone (Sean Connery) with a team of cops, the ""Untouchables"". The directing is excellent and Brian proves his experience for another time (see the scene with the baby carriage in the station, truly unforgettable...) As far as the performances are concerned Kevin Costner makes a good appearance but the show is stolen by experienced Sean Connery, who fairly wins the golden figurine. Robert de Niro is also delectable in his role. I believe that ""The Untouchables"" is the best movie of Brian De Palma. You may think that the story of the movie, the battle between Eliot Ness and Al Capone, is threadbare but for the season it was played, was a great success.

"Probably not a classic, but entertaining...","As others have pointed out- the historical inaccuracies are just far too many to count. This is problematic when you're making a movie based on very well known real people, and is incredibly distracting. Be wary of anyone claiming to be a history buff who missed that.In its favor, it does get across some of the problems with Prohibition, and at least some of its more devastating after-effects. Especially given that this is de Palma, the parallels to our modern drug war are inevitable. And unlike so many Mafia movies, the mobsters are portrayed as villains, not as amusing family men. Thanks to de Niro, you see Capone's charisma, but feel no sympathy.Unlike quite a few here, I got the fact that many scenes were meant to be HOMAGE, rip-off. I don't love de Palma, but he knows his film, and he knew exactly what he was doing. I enjoyed the nod to the true classic gangster movies.But even given that, I found the baby carriage scene maddening. The action was great and well-executed, and the unbelievable nature of Garcia's shot didn't bother me. But the thing with the baby was overly heavy-handed and drawn out. Puh-leeze.I don't think Costner is much of an actor, and his gesture towards a mid-Western accent is about as far as he can go. But his non-acting almost works here, as it does in a few of his other films such as Bull Durham and Field of Dreams. I say almost works because some of his actions seem strangely unmotivated and out of character. I'm referring especially to his throwing Nitti off the building, which is historically completely wrong, and highly questionable from both an ethical and film-making standpoint.Connery is his usual, but fantastic self. This was definitely one of those ""body of work"" Oscars, and I'm fine with that.Overall, this film is over-rated as both a classic and a historical piece. But it is better than most, and is certainly engaging and entertaining.",,Anonymous,Crime
Disney's The Godfather,"I rented this movie thinking it was going to be something like the godfather or Goodfellas. Really, it wasn't. I would say that if Disney ever does a gangster movie it will be just like this one. And It'll probably have Kevin Costner in it as well. He's just not a very convincing tough guy and you can add that to the fact that his dialog is dry and unwhitty. Both Mel Gibson AND Harrison Ford turned down the role of Elliot Ness before Costner was asked to play it. Now we know why; Gibson and Ford don't do lame roles with lame dialog and lame action.

Tired . . . .,"Of any of the things I can say about Brian Depalma's The Untouchables tired is the word that comes most to mind. It is filled with instances that have been recycled or redone. Plot points that are so predictable that even a person who has never seen a movie before will realise it all.The way Sean Connery is introduced you know he is going to die. In the beginning you know the whole thing is a hoax and they haven't caught the criminals, Even the score by Ennio Morricone seems rehashed from other movies. There is nothing interesting about the movie, not it's dialogue, not it's acting. Nothing.Even the set that people praise is not that great. There is scene in the middle of the movie where a car comes down a road and every car parked on the side is the same. If you want to make a period piece why be so lazy why not actually make the effort to have it all down to detail.The acting is pretty generic. Robert Deniro must be laughing at the easy money he has made by playing the character that he has played in so many other movies. Sean Connery plays an irishman with the worst accent I have ever heard. At some points he is heavily accented at other times there is nothing. And somehow he got the best supporting Oscar for this.Still the movie provides a little entertainment because it is well made by Brian De Palma.

Slightly bloated but still entertaining.,"The mob is flourishing in Chicago during prohibition under the command of Al Capone (De Niro), and things are getting out of hand. One cop, Eliot Ness (Costner) has decided this corruption and violence must come to an end and Capone must be taken out. We all know what happens.An overall good mobster movie, The Untouchables isn't as great as it could've been although I do enjoy it. DePalma takes a premise that could have been truly great and gives us the popcorn version. Some of the scenes are simply way over the top, beyond belief, and do not seem to fit with the rest of the film giving us glimpses of the man that we see today, pumping out mostly trash such as Mission Impossible and the like, with the exception of Carlito's Way. The cast is excellent, and came out before Costner became the King of Flop and still appeared in decent films. De Niro as Capone was a wise choice, although he's not on screen much, and is entirely believable and Connery can play an old wise cop with ease.The climatic rail station scene is impressive even with all of that slow motion, but I do like it, unlike some who hate the movie because of it. It's just not as good as some people here would like to make you think and many movies are much more deserving of the Top 250.

They were the best against Al Capone,"I have seen several times this film, and what I like most of it is the acting of Robert De Niro as Al Capone. De Niro here is simply the arrogant Italian mafia man, the way he talks the way he argues, he is simply the best. Acting of Sean Connery and Andy Garcia also convinced me a lot, one represented a honest policeman able to do his job day by day, and the other (García) was the young one who tries to demonstrate himself and everyone that he can do everything well. All these actors surpassed the acting of Costner, who was also good, but not at the level of the others mentioned. The film shows that any mafia organization to survive has to have good links with the local government and its institutions. Al Capone was able to establish these links and only when they were broken his empire started to collapse.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best....Watch it.,"This movie has everything going for it. Great story, good cast, great musical score, and of course Sean Connery. It's violent sure but not as over the top like many movies in the 1980's. Sean Connery's performance is brilliant. It's worth it to watch just because of him. Kevin Costner isn't bad either since this is the era before his career took a nosedive.It's probably the most underrated gangster film of all time. When people talk about films like the Godfather and Scarface this film should come up as well but usually it's over looked for some reason. Sure it depicts the side of the law unlike the other two but that doesn't mean it's any less awesome. And some times the good guys don't act in ways you'd think they would I'd recommend this to anyone who is a fan of drama or action movies.If you don't like violence you probably won't like this movie because there is quite a bit of it.10 of 10 one of the best movies I've ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Printing the legend and making it great,"This has been a favorite film of mine for a long time, and I just got the opportunity to see it for the first time in widescreen.  So first things first.  Stephen H. Burum deserved an Oscar for his heroic cinematography. The film absolutely shimmers, and you really need to see the full image to understand how much the film is visually of a piece with the rest of Brian DePalma's work.  Though the plot is minimal and the historical accuracy is for the birds, the dialogue and characterizations are tough and sure (listen particularly to the alley conversation between Malone and his old friend on the police force, a great scene I never hear anyone mention).I will not say anything about Sean Connery.   I want to praise Costner instead.  This is a man who has gotten a lot of flack for his acting, but this is the one case where he seems to have really found a role he could commit to.  He breathes the righteousness and honor of Ness down into his very shoes, and it pays off in a sincere and commanding performance.  Much praise also for his aggressive physicality in the role, from his  hurling of an envelope of cash into a would-be briber's face to his power in the train station shootout (it's him, not DePalma, who makes this scene work for me).This film is a wonderful period piece because it does not cram the period down your throat.  Instead, it seems lived-in and authentic.  The actors don't seem awed by the fact that it's the 1930s all around them.  It's just an afterthought, and that's the way it should be.See this one, and savor it.  Hooray to Brian DePalma for his best film.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Terrific film,"My Age: 13In the early 1930's, in Prohibtion Chicago, Al Capone, played by Robert de Niro, ruled.  He smuggled illegal liquor into the city and defied the law. Eliot Ness, played by Kevin Costner, swore he'd bring him down and assembles a team to help him.  They include an Irish beat cop, Jimmy Malone, played by Sean Connery, an FBI accountant, Oscar Wallace, played by Charles Martin Smith, and a recruit sharpshooter, George Stone, played by Andy Garcia. They could not be bought.  They were The Untouchables.The acting in The Untouchables is great.  Kevin Costner, Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia are all good, Robert de Niro plays Al Capone well, and Sean Connery walked away with an Academy Award.  The Oscar-nominated music score by Ennio Morricone is great as well.  The film has plenty of action to satisfy action fans, and is a very interesting and thrilling story.  The only part that I didn't really enjoy was a scene that so many others loved. The slow-motion baby/shootout scene was highly praised, but I thought it was a bit awkward.

Overrated but entertaining,"I remember seeing this on its initial release and, while realizing that the entire movie was a piece of fiction, enjoying the film for its entertainment value.  Every time I see it, I can still see why.  However, I find it hard to understand how this film could be rated as one of the top 250 films of all time, seeing how 'Untouchables' has an insurmountable flaw at its center: Kevin Costner.There are certain roles that Costner can play, mostly because they seem tailored for his personality.  Roles like the one in Tin Cup, or Field of Dreams, or even No Way Out (a better film than this one) match up better. His Elliot Ness is treacly and unengaging, and Patricia Clarkson's June Cleaver performance doesn't help at all.  Costner's entire repertoire consists of furrowing his brow; the more intense the scene, the further it is furrowed, but nowhere does he ever project any true emotion.Even more unfortunately, Costner is paired off between two of the best actors of the time, Robert DeNiro and Sean Connery.  Connery gives the performance of his life here, winning a well-deserved Oscar, and DeNiro is simply DeNiro.  Even Charles Martin Smith gives a more energetic performance than Costner.Brian DePalma outdoes himself, especially in the baby-carriage scene, but also in the overall lush look of the film.  That and the brilliant performances by DeNiro and Connery make this an entertaining film, but not a great one.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The best movie on Al Capone.,"Before ""The untouchables"", Kevin Costner wasn't as big a star as he is today.  So you could consider ""The untouchables"" to be the movie that made a movie star of him.  Nowadays, everybody knows him.  We all know that he has delivered some very good performances and some terrible ones.  But his best performance is without a doubt his performance in this movie.  He seemed to know the feelings of his character very well and was great in the role of Eliot Ness, the cop who finally gets Capone convicted.  Also, we have Sean Connery who plays Malone, the man who helps Ness put Capone in prison and I think he steals the show in his Oscar-winning performance as best-supporting actor.The movie begins with Al Capone (Robert De Niro) getting interviewed while his personal barber shaves him.  The second scene is what sets off the movie: Capone's men, who are incapable of convincing a bartender into selling alcohol that Capone imported into Chicago (we are in the 30's and there is prohibition in Chicago).  The bartender refuses and in revenge, the men leave a suitcase with a bomb in it.  But there is a little girl in the pub who only went there to get her daily milk and as the men walk out, she follows them trying to give them back their suitcase.  But the suitcase explodes in her hands killing her on the spot.  And then the story kicks off.Ness (Costner) tries to bust Capone but doesn't know how and doesn't really have the guts to go all the way.  But when he meets Malone (Connery), he is taught a lesson of courage as well as how to beat Capone and the Mob. But how can a few strong and courageous cops stop the impossible from happening.  So naturally, the Mob fights back and  causes some serious damage in the cops' camp.Brian De Palma used some ""extreme violence"" to show the power of both the Mob and the cops in this incredibly powerful drama based on the true life of detective Eliot Ness who finally got Capone behind bars.  De Palma also masterfully directed the movie and made good choices for his cast which consists of Costner, Connery, De Niro, and Andy Garcia.  The script is excellent as well.  But as I stated before, I believe that it Sean Connery that makes this movie so great with his excellent performance as Malone.  I think that it is his best performance in his whole career.  So see this movie.  It's great classic about the Mob vs. cops where for once, the Mob appears as the bad-guy.  It's worth seeing at any cost.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
When the Mob Met a Boy Scout,"Brian De Palma's The Untouchables takes the crime saga and injects it with a dose of old-school Hollywood heroism. This isn't your typical gritty mob film, it's a battle of archetypes: Al Capone, the cigar-chomping kingpin of corruption, versus Eliot Ness, the lawman so squeaky-clean he probably polishes his badge before bed.Unlike The Godfather or Goodfellas, this film doesn't romanticize the mafia, it paints them as brutal, untouchable (until they aren't), and just as theatrical as De Palma's signature camera moves. Robert De Niro's Capone is a cartoonishly ruthless dictator, proving that organized crime isn't just about power, it's about showmanship. Meanwhile, Sean Connery's streetwise mentor reminds us that taking down the mob requires more than a badge; it takes a little bit of their own ruthlessness.The Untouchables is less about realism and more about myth-making, an operatic showdown where justice carries a shotgun and isn't afraid to use it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"When viewed as a gangster flick, not a crime drama, ""Untouchables"" succeeds","The Prohibition-era ""fight"" between gangster Al Capone and G-man Eliot Ness over the streets of Chicago is the stuff of legend. For this reason, director Brian De Palma's next big mob-themed follow-up to ""Scarface"" is quite a challenge. Capone is an enigma of sorts: the closest thing to a tall tale that history has to offer. Casting Robert De Niro was an excellent choice in attempt to do the character justice, but ""The Untouchables,"" as entertaining and suspenseful as it is, never fully captures the tone and magnitude of Capone and 1930s Chicago.Feds and gangsters flick would be a better way to describe ""The Untouchables"" than organized crime drama. Anyone expecting a Godfather film or ""Scarface"" should lower those expectations to the level of '30s-themed action movie. Kevin Costner stars as Ness, leading a team of feds called The Untouchables who decide to go straight after the mob. They consist of an accountant (Charles Martin Smith) a rookie who's a good shot (Andy Garcia) and the wise veteran (Sean Connery in an Oscar-winning role).For a mostly fictitious account of Capone's arrest, you'd think De Palma would pull out all the stops and that his film would glamorize the heck out of the mob and juice up the story to make it as cool as possible. He does a lot of nice aerial shots like the very beginning and the whole cast has lots of fun with guns, but it's the characters that feel a bit cold. Costner is just okay as Ness. Yes, his character is supposed to be a moral by-the-books type who eventually embraces the slightly less legal means of getting the job done because the ends justify the means, but he could us a bit more flavor. You do like him though by the end of the film at the least.I don't know what Connery does that well to earn an Oscar. I think the Academy was like most people with regards to Connery in the '80s: smitten every time he shows up on screen without a license to kill in tow. Malone is an ideal part being that he's wise, skilled and also reckless -- and David Mamet also gives him the film's best lines -- but there's nothing that suggests he's more than a likable character mold.The best scene in ""The Untouchables"" can be looked at in one of two ways: either as a fantastic modern ode to a classic war film (the silent Russian film ""The Battleship Potemkin"") or as ""well that was great, but it wasn't original."" I'm somewhere in between. The train station stairs make a beautiful backdrop for the firefight that's not unlike the final scene of ""Scarface,"" and De Palma's slowing down of the action makes it all the more enjoyable, but there's a lingering sense of wanting something truly one-of-a-kind.What Mamet's script does best other than good action fodder is provide a sense of whether or not someone is really untouchable, whether or not the law truly protects anyone. Capone lived above the law for so long and Ness loses a ton of men in his restless pursuit, having to bend the law at times in order to continue it. Capone's arrest does suggest that we all have to answer sometime when we don't govern ourselves by a set of principles.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A summer movie for kids out of school...,"...that's that I thought after I left the theatre. I can go out about certain directorial techniques that annoyed me, but when I saw the Canadian border raid and all of the agents on horseback miraculously dodging bullets, I wanted to become invisible. I WAS EMBARRASSED! I DIDN'T WANT TO BE SEEN WATCHING IT!The shoot-out on the steps with the baby carriage was straight out of film history 101 - a rip-off of the classic Odessa Steps scene from ""Potemkin"". The opening scene with DeNiro as Capone getting a shave was a rip-off of the famous shave scene in ""Key Largo"".I seem to recall it was promoted as being more true to the historical record than previous (and MUCH better) productions with the same name, and that's why I wanted to see it. Also, I'd really liked ""Scarface"", so I thought this would be pretty good. WRONG!I'm not going to pick this apart, but:1. Al Capone was YOUNG. He did the majority of his ""work"" in his 20's. By the time he was DeNiro's age he'd already died of syphillis.2. Frank Nitti was NOT thrown off a rooftop by Eliot Ness. He committed suicide rather than do time in prison.3. Eliot Ness was not the squeaky clean and honest law man he's portrayed as being in this film. At least the Robert Stack characterization was more entertaining (he used to say he didn't act, but RE-acted to the various characters in the show).4. Shall I go on?If you want to see an entertaining movie on gangland Chicago, watch the original Untouchables pilot, ""Scarface Mob"", with the great Neville Brand as Capone (okay, he's too old too, but a LOT more entertaining!). It set the tone for the whole series, nearly any episode of which is infinitely better than this bloated piece by DePalma. It's not really historically accurate, but it did get the mob upset enough to put a hit on Desi Arnaz (it's a Desilu production). And it's full of little touches that really make it fun to watch. NO ONE does Frank Nitti better than Bruce Gordon.Oh yeah, Connery was ok, and I guess he was due an Oscar for something, but how this performance or this movie could compare to any of his 007 performances escapes me. His role seemed gratuitous, but his friends who had the votes in the Academy didn't show it if they felt that way themselves.Oh well, I guess I'm in the minority on this one.

Oscar for stealing the show goes to Connery,"On the day Movies 🎥 lost one of the finest performers to ever grace our screens. I decided to watch one of my favorite films with a great screenplay by David Mamet . Brian De Palma directs only a few years after Scarface and with casualties of war to follow is surely at the height of his powers. The classical way Ennio Morricone weaves his music into the film until it becomes a character itself. DeNiro is intense as Capone. Andy Garcia playing the rookie seems anything but that on the screen as he produces one of his great performances of his career.

A fine gangster movie,"Set in prohibition era Chicago where gangster Al Capone lives the highlife with apparent impunity a new lawman, Treasury Agent Elliot Ness is brought in to clean up. He quickly learns that most of the local police can't be trusted so builds up his own small team. These include veteran beat cop Jimmy Malone, sharpshooting rookie George Stone and Oscar Wallace, a Treasury Department accountant who believes Capone can be brought down by examining his lack of tax payments. They quickly make progress, intercepting illicit alcohol and more importantly arresting somebody with information that could bring Capone down... this puts them in the sights of Capone's gunmen.This fictionalised version of how Elliot Ness brought down Al Capone is a lot of fun with great characters and some fairly gritty action. This action includes a young girl killed by a bomb and Capone killing somebody with a baseball bat as well as numerous shootings. The cast does a fine job with Kevin Costner putting in a relatively low-key performance as Ness which contrasts nicely Robert DeNiro's bombastic Capone. There are also notable performances from Sean Connery who is fun as Irish cop Malone despite his obviously Scottish accent. The story moves at a good pace and even though most viewers will know how it must end there are some shocks along the way. If you are a fan of the gangster genre this is definitely one to watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
de Palma at his best,"Brian de Palma was good in his little-known films ""The fury"" and ""Carrie."" Here, he proves he that is better than ever as he doffs his cap at the Russian filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein's 1920's classic ""Battleship Potemkyn"" and its incredible Odessa steps sequence with the baby in the pram. This sequence is finely executed and a charming homage to Eisenstein. Hats off to de Palma!The opening crane shot of De Niro (Al Capone) surrounded by manicurists, shoeshiners and journalists sets the mood of what is to follow--cinema for the cinephile. Here is a director's film--the script of David Mamet takes a back seat, the music of Ennio Morricone never overpowers. You are forced to drink in the heady wine from the director.Take the killing of Malone. The camera captures Malone's movements from outside the building--moving as a human being would. Take the killing of Billy Drago (Nitti). The camera deceives Nitti and the viewer as Ness falls off the roof with a cry.If de Palma was at his best he also got three fine performances in the film--one from Sean Connery, one from De Niro, and one from Billy Drago.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Downfall of Al Capone...,"This is simply a fantastic film. Everything works: the acting, the direction, the David Mamet screenplay, the cinematography, the costumes and set design, and the sublime score by Ennio Morricone. The cursing and violence both of which I normally avoid and detest are applied artistically and appropriately. Perhaps De Palma's masterpiece, The Untouchables won the Academy's hearts and Sean Connery finally got his Oscar, which was long overdue, for the role of a tough but honored beat cop, Malone, who helps Elliot (Costner) Ness take down Al Capone (De Niro).""The Untouchables"" was a true gangland masterpiece, that takes you from the mean streets of Chicago to the mountainous United States-Canadian border, while never letting go of your attention for even a second. Director Brian De Palma (""Scarface"" and ""Mission: Impossible"") engages you with this epic story of good versus evil that is so brilliantly crafted that it rivals ""The Godfather"" in terms of its treatment of the material and the accuracy of the performances. The entire cast is excellent from Kevin Costner to Sean Connery, De Niro's perfect performance is the biggest surprise as he brings to shocking reality the ferocity of the mob boss that ruled Chicago with an iron fist.

Quite possibly the greatest gangster film,"There are some rare moments in film history when stars collide and movies are created with the fabric of sheer brilliance. This is one of these rare occasions.Brian De Palma is not the ""star"" of his film. Unlike the majority of his other work, he takes a step back and guides the ""orchestra"" masterfully. Every single shot of this movie is beautiful and appropriately placed. It feels like the director leaves his usual radical and personal style for a more conventional approach. The viewer is actually transported to the heart of 30s Chicago, partly of what it really was, partly of what urban lore has made us believe it was. One could say that this is the blueprint of Gotham city, in the batman mythos (1989's ""Batman"" by Tim Burton definitely feels like a dark spiritual cousin of this film). Anyway, to make you feel like you are actually in the heart of a city that has become legendary for its gangster activity is an incredible feat. Of course, whenever the plot delves into more ""thriller-like"" or suspenseful territory, De Palma grasps the opportunity and wrecks our nerves with his masterful approach. One of his most typical settings for a chase scene (in many of his movies) is a train/subway station, but the one in this film has to be one of the most gripping in the history of cinema! However, this movie would never have been what it is without its main feature: undoubtedly one of the best casting ensembles ever to grace the big screen. It feels like every actor was born to play his respective role. Obviously, Sean Connery steals the show with his Oscar winning performance. But apart from his highly praised performance, everybody else in the film fit their roles like hand in glove.The only drawback in this movie is the generic, soulless music by, the otherwise genius of a composer, Ennio Morricone. There's not much melody going on, just some random string chord progressions backed by terrible 80s synth drums. One of the great maestro's all time lows.Of course this is a minor detail in a movie of uncanny brilliance. If you are a casual movie-goer, this movie is guaranteed 2-hour entertainment, but if you are a longtime movie lover this movie will make you fall in love with cinema all over again.

If 'The A-Team' was based in the 1920s,"This movie has SO MANY clichés it's not even funny. Every character is a stereotype and every scene is stretched out as long as possible. I am honestly shocked that with such a star-studded cast, that this movie sucks as much as it does.

There are scenes in the movie that SHOULD only have lasted 2minutes, but instead lasts 7.

Can't touch this,"It's hard to believe that once upon a time, buying a bottle of WKD Blue from Tesco's on a Friday night could have bought you a one-way ticket to the slammer. However, in 1930s America (aka the era of 'prohibition,' i.e. making alcohol illegal) this was basically happening. Luckily, for us hardened drinkers good men like Al Capone ensured that we could still get drunk outside the local Weatherspoons and start a fight with someone smaller than us... or something like that.Actually, it wasn't quite like that. No matter how silly banning booze may sound to us, it happened and violent gangs flouted these laws, most famously Al Capone. That was why the city decided that a special police task force should be compiled to combat such nefarious criminal activity. Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) was put in charge of stemming illegal liquor activity in the city of Chicago and, at the same time, bringing down the most wanted of criminals, Al Capone (a padded out Robert DeNiro). 'The Untouchables' tells the, er slightly fictionalised, story of this.If you've ever done any research into this period of American history then you could probably make a twenty page list of the inaccuracies in this filmic interpretation of the actual events. For example, hero and villain never really met in real life and Elliot Ness was unhappily divorced, as opposed to his ideal life we see on screen. However, despite these sorts of points making the film more historically accurate, I'm pretty sure they would also make it a damn sight less enjoyable. And it is very, very enjoyable.First of all there's the cast. Whatever you may think about Robert DeNiro's more recent output, there's no denying that in 1987 he was still at the top of his game and he gives an excellent performance as the film's antagonist - the only complaint being that he's probably not in it enough, seeing as he - like the real life Al Capone - spent most of his life hiding in one luxury dwelling to the next. Kevin Costner was a gamble for the lead. This was before he was Robin Hood and his Box Office draw was questionable at the time as to whether he could headline such a big budget film. However, the film-makers made up for this by casting Sean Connery as his right-hand man (and, in doing so, helped market the film on the former Bond's inclusion). There's a young Andy Garcia in there too, but it's DeNiro, Costner and Connery who you're going to be the most interested in.Overall, it's a highly-entertaining gangster movie. Yes, it probably condenses more action into the film than should probably be there, but it makes it all the more entertaining for doing so. You probably don't have to be that into gangster/crime movies to appreciate this - definitely holds up to this day.a",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Gangster movie that flirts with suspense,"Brian de Palm is one of the directors who most copied the best sense of the word- Alfred Hitchcock, and ""The Untouchables,"" is a gangster psychological thriller, is a thought-provoking movie, full of features and good performances, although extremely caricature and dated. The script tells the story of Al Capone from the point of view of his executioners, who despite all the crimes committed by the dry law kingpin, he was convicted of tax evasion, a story so incredible that it looks like a sweet fiction, though Extremely flowery and romanticized, in very general lines, the story is true. The screenplay tells the story of four men, an accountant, an almost retired police officer, a police officer who has not even finished the academy yet, and a treasury agent, all obstinate to capture Al Capone. We have betrayal, death and demonstration of power, and how simply the act of taking away the drink (drink) of people would cause chaos and gigantic contraband, proving also that in the case of alcohol, the restriction only created a parallel market. Technically, the film has footage that looks like a 1950s movie, and that's nice, although sometimes I'm a bit of a shame, because Hitchcock's style is copied, and copied very well, we have an exquisite camera job, With prefect angles, plans sequences, against plounge, always privileged the suspense, in addition to a soundtrack that has a beautiful song and very good (even being one of suspense in a film of mafia,) already the rest of the track often gets half Dislocated from the rest of the film, but Brian always makes a point of guiding the scenes from his extremely varied track, which refers to the western to pop music, we also have a beautiful photograph that shouts that the film was made into film, it is a film Which already causes nostalgia, even for the 80's. Kevin Costner is excellent, conveying an air of patriotism and honesty blended with anger, which suits his partner, and the film's great highlight in terms of Performances that is the wonderful Sean Connery, ale more, even if with little screen time, Robert De Niro is giant and completely scary when it appears. Brian of Palm is sure to have traumas of his great ""Scarface"" to be completely ignored of the great festivals and even of big cinemas due to its violence, with that, in ""The Untouchables"" he censures the violence and diminishes the very concept of it, and This harms his film because it takes away the terror of Al Capone's actions by taking the fear out of his viewer (even in the taco scene, which was done precisely to make the viewer feel the fear, does not work because it is badly made, and even in the Viscerality is silly); finally, ""The Untouchables"" is a good suspense thriller mafia movie, which appeals too much.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is really more a film version of the television series than a film version of any real events. Some things, like the ledger and the jury switch, are based on reality.

Essential Viewing,"1930's Chicago, Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is a treasury agent intent on bringing down one of the most powerful criminals in the prohibition era, Al Capone (Robert De Niro), by forming his own group of incorruptible, untouchable agents.Every job on this film is undertaken, in my opinion, with near perfection, from the acting to directing to the music, they are all executed with such brilliance it makes me realise why I love movies so much.All the stars do a superb job especially Sean Connery, who won an Oscar for his part and is in the best role of his career. Even Kevin Costner, who I am not the biggest fan of does a fine job going from an inexperienced agent to one of the most well known lawmen in American History. David Mamet's script is is excellent with some lines that are unforgettable, one of which, my favourite when Robert De Niro loses his cool and says about Ness ""I want him Dead, I want his family dead, I want his house burnt to the ground and I want to go in there in the middle of the night and p*ss on his ashes"".True master composer Ennio Morricone fame for The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is on board for scoring duties and it enhances it even further. The different types of camera shots make it a visual treat with a crane shot early on which depicts a street filled with Ford Model T's which transports you straight to the 1930's to a hand-held single cut as a killer stalks Connery's Malone through his apartment.I really have no bad words to say about The Untouchables, this to me is essential viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Marevellously emotional, powerful, and violent... a huge achievement","Who would have thought a man, Brian De Palma, make a gangster film as good as Scarface? Not many, maybe: but no-one whosoever would predict that he made a better one, within five years, especially. But he did, and in doing so, he created the perfect gangster movie: passionate, stylish and emotionally jerking, this is both stunningly graphic and surprisingly beautiful.1930's, Chicago. Al Capone (played superbly by De Niro) proudly proclaims what a success he is, and that he is in no way involved with any illegal shipments of alcohol, or any violent crime. He denies, very strongly, that he does not kill anyone who refuses to buy his products.The next day, Chicago: a little girl goes to boil her water in a local pub, and the owner refuses to a man dressed in white to buy any liquor. He 'accidently' leaves behind his briefcase. The girl notices, and runs out to give it to him, but before she even gets out, the briefcase explodes in her face, as well as destroying the whole pub. The man gets in his car and drives away.Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner, his best performance) is a cop, a recent signing to the Chicago law enforcement team. He's a treasury officer, and on arrival with this news of the bombing, he becomes more eager to get Capone. A meeting with the mother (in an extremely heartfelt scene-trust me, you won't be expecting to cry so early on) really shows him what this man, Capone, is doing to the city. He's a crook, and he must be stopped.But his first assignment is a complete bust. Instead of picking up the alcohol, he gets the umbrellas, and becomes the laughing stock of the whole department. Not only does this hugely embarrass Ness, it fuels Capone to hilarity- thus is the start of a feud that will end more than one life...This film is superb on so many levels. As well as the action set pieces being excellent (if surprisingly violent- for its time, how did this get a UK '15' certificate) but it also has a majestic and epic feel to it. The emotions of both sides are shown and played out marvellously- particularly when Irish Cop Malone (Sean Connery) comes into the picture.Perhaps the most shocking scene, in ways, is the best. As Al Capone mercilessly beats the head in of a fellow 'family' member, and the blood spills across the table cloth, it really proves this is no popcorn picture. Fans of gory films will be pleased, but in some ways subdued. This is not gory for fun, or to push boundaries- this is gory to show in what graphic details these psychopaths will go through.An achievement that stands tall, 'The Untouchables' is a classic.

Grew On Me,"Untouchables, The (1987)**** (out of 4)DePalma's suspenseful tale of Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) and his untouchables (Sean Connery, Charles Martin Smith, Andy Garcia) trying to bring Al Capone (Robert DeNiro) to justice in 1930's Chicago. It's strange what time can do for a film as it can either help or hurt it and in the case of this film it really seems to have helped it a great deal. I first saw this movie in the early 90's and found it rather weak and the next viewing didn't help much either. Now, being more than fifteen years, I decided to pay the film another visit and this time it really hit me as to why so many have called it as masterpiece. I still wouldn't call it DePalma's greatest film but it's certainly right up there and I couldn't help but wish we'd get this director back to making films like this. The film has a lot going for it but we can start with the visual style, which is at times breathtaking. DePalma has always been known for his style and that mixes extremely well with the scenes of early Chicago. Another major plus is a wonderful music score by the legendary Ennio Morricone. The score really puts you in the time and place of the setting but it also does a great job at pumping up the action as well as building the suspense. The train station sequence is one of the most memorable in the film but try watching it without the volume and without the score. It certainly isn't the same. Another major plus are the performances by the all-star cast. Costner is at the top of his game as the laid back ness and that's what makes Connery's performance so great. The two are completely different but together they make for an excellent team and you can't blame Oscar voters for awarding Connery the Best Supporting Actor. Garcia and Charles Martin Smith never get the credit they deserve but they too offer up fine work. I'm rather split on DeNiro because the screenplay really doesn't do him any justice as Capone seems to just be dropped into the film from time to time without any real need. I'm really not even sure we had to see Capone for the story to work. The film is rather brutal, violent and at times very suspenseful and this is why it remains so memorable today.",,Anonymous,Crime
Could have been so much better,"The soundtrack did not fit this movie at all and completely ruined a lot of otherwise not bad scenes. I was disappointed with the 'feel good Hollywood' vibe and acting methods of a lot of the actors. Although this movie boasts some pretty renowned names (De Niro, Connery), and they did not give mediocre performances by any means, the weak and trite script coupled with their delivery style (surely the fault of the director De Palma) resulted in a piece of generic Hollywood fluff. Really the only thing saving this movie from being a complete and utter disaster, in my eyes at any rate, is the stunning cinematography and the inclusion of a few visual De Palma tricks of the trade. In the end I just feel let down, especially in light of what could have been had he opted for a more serious vibe like Carlitos Way, although The Untouchables is still ahead above The Black Dahlia- his worst film in my opinion.

He isn't Scorsese , that's why goodfellas worked , and yes they're similar although they're telling story from different prospective! another nuch better movie American gangster!
Good thing - 1) PRODUCTION DESIGN- they just nailed it , no question!
2) AL CAPONE PERFORMANCE- Every single scene with him is on another level. They way he portrays a Italian mafia is just awesome! He studied a lot about al Capone. His dialogue, his body language , movement, reactions feels genuine! Only thing u will remember after u finish this film. No not sean Connery lol
Bad thing 1] UNINTERESTING MAIN CHARACTERS- Costner is just opposite to de niro. He's just a terrible choice to play the leading role. Not to mention bad acting, also lacks the charm to play opposite de niro. He has same wooden face throughout the movie.
From the beginning they showed al Capone is invincible and no one can touch him and his business! Ok. Director and writer be like let's create a looser club so audience can relate with them. No , that's hilarious. The accountant guy goes full on Rambo in the bridge, again funny! When Connery shots that dead guy to make the other guy talk is a really powerful scene.

still at the top of my De Palma list; stellar cast with a tight ball of a script,"Among the top five films of 1987, and filmmaker Brian De Palma's career, is the Untouchables, a firecracker kind of Hollywood film that gives the story of Elliot Ness versus Al Capone some great panache. And it's the kind of great film that is so only through the combined efforts of everybody, not just De Palma, even as it is his vision (sometimes playfully homage-like, as I'll mention in a moment), but his cast, crew, and the script by David Mamet.The cast here includes Kevin Costner, in one of his three or four passably good performances, in the Ness part (like his later Jim Garrison role, the confident if a bit conflicted hero); De Niro in a ham-bone best as Capone, with one of the more eye-opening and funny scenes he's ever done (eg with a bat); Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia in juicy supporting roles. And then one comes to Sean Connery, in his deserved Oscar winning turn as Irish cop turned Ness partner Jim Malone, who has the toughest words and the biggest guts of the group. It's in his work here, where he has some of that confidence of past performances into a very real character that makes it quite a piece. Aside from the sheer presence of a star like Connery on screen, there's some depth he gives to the character too, just as De Niro does with his choices as an actor (even if his role is the larger-than-life one).De Palma, at his disposal as a craftsman, has good editors and camera people working alongside him, as well as Ennio Morricone on music (a small 'yey' emits from my mind). Through them his film is a slick, but not overbearingly at all, kind of 1930's Hollywood picture, with a story of the cops versus robbers, in some unconventional circumstances. The centerpiece of the climax, De Palma's homage to Eistenstein's Battleship Potemkin, is operatic and grandiose and puts the drama of what was in real life likely quite different into a spectacular sequence, is as entertaining as it could be. While it's not the only action sequence in the film, one could point to just that one sequence as being a true highlight of doing homage well. In truth it's been a little while since I've seen the Untouchables, and maybe even longer since I've seen it from start to finish (and, unfortunately, never on a big screen). But I wouldn't dare to tell you not to watch it if you haven't yet.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

In spite of all the big names in the cast, The Untouchables is an example of big money used for a minuscule production.

The main character is, both in this movie and in any other books I read, an average man, that acted following the orders given by political leaders of that time. He basically led, in reality, not according to the movie, a well prepared team of gunmen that finished the mafia in a short time.Once again, do not get fooled by the movie, politicians decided that Mafia is no longer useful and they finished it. It's that simple. The Untouchables is unrealistic and the most overrated film I've ever seen.",,Anonymous,Crime
"An untouchable classic? Pretty much, despite some flaws.","I grew up on ""The Untouchables"" and as a slice of cinema it was one of my earliest memories of true directing and style - watching De Palma's famous train station sequence used to always leave me in awe, but it wasn't until I was older that I understood and recognized some of De Palma's trademarks. Looking back on ""The Untouchables"" now I view it as a different sort of movie - it seems somewhat less operatic and more of a tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top, exaggerated mob movie with all of De Palma's typical touches.But then again, it isn't. Because this is really the second of two times only that De Palma has totally proved to audiences that he's able to construct a masterful thriller/drama _on his own_ without copying (or ""referencing"") Hitchcock. ""Blow Out"" is a good movie, as are many of De Palma's others, but ""The Untouchables"" and ""Scarface"" are arguably the only two he's made where it's really a De Palma movie, and not a De Palma-Hitchcock homage.""The Untouchables"" seemed a lot better when I was younger but it's still a classic and due to my fond memories of it I'll probably always have a soft spot for it. However I do now recognize flaws I didn't used to - De Niro's Capone, for example, is a great portrayal but given awkward screen time...it works as a sort of convenient interlude to Costner and co.'s adventures - Costner kills some people, flash to De Niro yelling ""I want his head!"", flash back to Costner...it's not exactly a perfect balance as many of it just seems out-of-place...De Niro is wonderful but would losing his scenes harm the film? Not much. Instead, studying his character more would have been a wiser choice - De Palma could have easily made a three-hour epic that studies both men's stories and motivations and as a result the overall story would have been much stronger and the film better.As it is this is sort of a ""Godfather Lite"" - it's not an incredibly strong film, it has some flaws, it could have had ideas expanded, but at the end of the day it's a really great piece of entertainment with some marvelous set pieces, convincing performances and a legendary and iconic turn by De Niro, who totally steals the show from everyone else.The baseball speech scene is a classic - that's the type of stuff that makes me wish they had spent a bit more time focusing on him along with Costner, rather than just Costner.4.5/5",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Old school Hollywood melodrama,"""The Untouchables"" tells the tale of G-man Elliott Ness'  campaign to unseat Chicago mob boss Al Capone (circa 1930's). Given the Hollywood clout behind this flick (De Palma, Mamet, etc.), the film is surprisingly lackluster and fraught with overacting, staginess, some hokey scripting, and fictionalizations. Nonetheless, ""The Untouchables"" will make an entertaining couch potato watch for those looking for no-brainer gangland melodrama. (C+)Note - Connery garnered both a globe and an Oscar for his role which didn't involve any special tests of his abilities. Go figure.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Not quite, but close in my book.Oh, and DeNiro is great too as Capone.

"Delivers the goods when it comes to tense, suspenseful and eventually explosive action.","What 'The Untouchables (1987)' does better than most pictures of the kind is deliver the goods when it comes to genuinely tense, suspenseful and eventually explosive action set-pieces, especially when it comes to balancing its build-ups with its pay-offs. Its gritty, somewhat unrelenting bloodshed usually has tangible and lasting consequences for its characters and world. However, the film does take a while to get going and its final third is slightly baggy. It also doesn't do all that much character work. Still, there's a lot to like and, even, admire about the picture. For a start, the stairway baby-carriage sequence really is fantastic. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Untouchable In It's Genre,"I just revisited this film after having viewed it many times over. Not to date myself but I saw it premier in theaters when I was 17 years old. In this viewer's opinion it remains De Palma's best gangster crime drama, although it was a tough choice considering, ""Scarface"" and ""Carlito's Way"". This film has outstanding direction, screenplay, cinematography, settings, costume, score and acting. The ensemble cast includes artists such as Costner, Connery, De Niro, Garcia, Smith, Clarkson, Drago and Kehoe. The entire cast including the supporting cast deliver superb performances. However it is Costner, Connery, Garcia and De Niro who command the screen. De Niro even uses his method acting which he is liable to do. The film starts off blazing with Al Capone surrounded by his henchmen trying to reason with reporters why people are going to do what they want to do and he is simply responding to their will as an honest businessman. The plot is set during the late 1920's Prohibition and revolves around Bureau of Prohibition agent Eliot Ness who is assigned the task of taking down Capone, the mob kingpin of the entire city of Chicago. Ness is leading a special task force and is as straight as a shooter, pun intended, as they come. He immediately encounters corruption within his task force which forces him to go outside to find his own team. In steps Jimmy Malone who is an Irish-American veteran beat cop and is reluctant to join Ness at first. He agrees to work with Ness if he will let him do things his way which sometimes means thinking and acting like a criminal. Next is George Stone who is a hot tempered Italian-American sharp shooter straight out of the academy. Ness next consults with U.S. Treasury Agent Oscar Wallace who determines the best way to nab Capone is through tax evasion as he has not filed an income tax return for several years. Ness encounters more corruption when he is offered a bribe to drop the case against Capone as he is feeling the loss of income and heat from Ness. Capone dispatches his hitman Frank Nitti to threaten Ness' family in another attempt to back off. During a raid to intercept a liquor shipment at the Canadian - U.S. border the team captures Capone's bookkeeper George. Jimmy slyly hoodwinks a brisk agreement from George to cooperate with the investigation. Wallace and George are heading to a safe house, but encounter Nitti dressed as a cop and do not make it. Jimmy intuitively knows the Chief of Police Dorsett sold Wallace and George out to Nitti. He confronts Dorsett and beats the location of Capone's chief bookkeeper Walter Payne out of him. Later that night Jimmy is ambushed by Nitti and is bullet ridden by a Tommy gun. Before he passes Jimmy is able to inform Ness of Walter's plan to leave town. Walter eventually testifies in court about Capone's untaxed income, but it takes some chicanery on Ness' part to make things happen. The judge won't accept evidence of jury tampering and right before the judge is going to claim a mistrial Ness implies that there are many powerful politician's names in the bookkeeping ledger showing payoffs by Capone. This prompts the judge to immediately switch the current jury for a jury in an adjacent courtroom. The plot is thrilling, clever, intelligent, action packed, ingenious, cathartic, duplicitous, gritty, poetic and has a liberating end. There are so many memorable scenes and quotes in this film. My favorite scene is when Ness confronts Capone in his hotel lobby over the killings of Wallace and George. It is an intense scene. My favorite quotes are from a scene where Ness and Nitti are on a rooftop after Ness is aware that it was Nitti who murdered Jimmy. Nitti says to Ness, ""You're friend squealed like a stuck Irish pig"". Ness tosses him from the rooftop and yells, ""Did he sound anything like that?"". It is a riveting exchange. This film has sublime direction by De Palma shot in his signature format and is bravura in it's genre. It remains a timeless classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Bad script, bad director, bad acting, bad movie","The Untouchables is a horrible movie. David Mamet wrote the script but one couldn't tell unless reading the credits. It lacks Mamets natural flare, that great dialogue and those undertones that made Mamet who he is. I wont get into the historical aspect of the movie sufficive to say there is little. The direction of this movie is crap. Needless to say it was Brian DePalma. He focuses more on the costumes, cars, and scenery of the movie than the acting or script. The best moments in this movie were improvised by Connery (ie. the dead guy shot) and the rest could have been written by anybody who has ever been to a screen writing class.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
About as good as a De Palma film can get,"Brian De Palma is a well-known director; I guess what he is known for is taking a theme that, in one way or another, involves violence and action, and he puts it on the silver screen, with immense amounts of both violence and action, labeled as drama, instead of more conventional drama. We saw it with Carrie, we saw it with Scarface, and now, we see it with The Untouchables. Now, those are the only three movies of his that I've seen, but if all of his movies are like this, then so be it. If not, then please forgive me for this review, and chalk it up to ignorance on my part. The plot is very good, and mostly well-paced; I understand that it's not entirely accurate to the original, actual story of Al Capone, but it's based somewhat on him. Personally, as long as the film is interesting, and somewhat true to facts, I don't mind the film not being the real story. Now, I said the pace was *mostly* good; once the first hour and a half has passed, the film goes a little slowly for the next fifteen minutes or so, but then it picks up again, and doesn't drag at all for the rest of the picture. The acting is all great; Costner, Connery, Garcia, Martin Smith, De Niro... even the supporting cast was great; I seriously doubt that Frank Nitti could have been portrayed better than Billy Drago did. His snake-like appearance and behavior was excellent, really made the character. Robert De Niro probably gives the most impressive performance in the whole film; unfortunately, he gets far too little screen time. Whenever you do see him on-screen, you thoroughly enjoy it. The four ""untouchables"" have great chemistry, which is what really makes their ""team"" work, together with their diverse personalities. The way they did the whole late twenties look, with the cars, the buildings, the clothes, etc. was great. It looks and feels authentic. The dialog was well-written, but the film does arguably have too many one-liners, for this type of film. The action is well-done, well-choreographed and very cool. The shootouts, the chasing... the film also seemed to have a very impressive amount of great, memorable scenes, for such a short gangster piece(compared to, say, The Godfather, which is three hours long). The score is excellent; Ennio Morricone usually does great scores, and this is no exception. The cinematography is pretty impressive, and De Palma makes great use of closeups, pans, zooming and long takes. All in all, a great film that is just slightly less than a masterpiece. Maybe De Palma could have made it greater, had he just toned the action down(not that I would want that, honestly; I'm fine with how the film and his overall style of film-making is), but decided to make it more ""accessible"" instead. Maybe he's just incapable of making a true masterpiece, due to his style. Who knows. I recommend this to any fan of gangster/mafia films, any of the actors, and/or Brian De Palma. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Better on the large screen than T.V.,"I'm not going to rehash the story line at this point because you've most likely read the other ten pages or so detailing that. I choose to make mention of the acting and production values. Firstly, I saw this when it was released in the theaters and on a large screen it certainly makes a terrific impact, acting wise and in vision. The production was done with a ""money's no object"" quality and it shows. There is much detail given to sets, costumes and cars of the late 1920's. How many times have you seen a period film and there's always that one glitch in there like the most infamous one, a Roman centurion wearing a wrist watch? Not here. The acting, Kostner aside, is superb. Between de Niro and Connery there's pretty much nothing left for Kostner to do except read his lines, and he does that well. But as always, at least for me, for someone who's obviously more than just a capable actor, he STILL just reads his lines and plays it one dimensional. That's OK though because we get the impression, true or not, that Elliot Ness is a government worker just out doing his job, namely to bring down Mr. Big, aka Al Capone. Mr. de Niro on the other hand portrays as evil a character as Mr. Connery portrays an heroic one. Fact is, these two virtually steal the picture away from Kostner. I'm not being super critical of Mr. Kostner here because in essence he does shine dramatically and primarily because of the other two. They seem to have motivated him to go beyond and that's what any good ensemble with the chemistry can accomplish. One other point I just have to mention to all you film history buffs out there. The scene in the train depot where they're having a shoot out and the mother looses the grip on the baby carriage and it's shown rolling down the flight of stairs in slow motion. That is a direct quote from the early Russian silent film ""Battle Ship Potemkin"". Look for that scene and compare the two. A bit of an ""homage"" maybe or plagiarism?

""" Team  Work ! ""","Though not a masterpiece in my opinion, this is a good crime film focused on Al Capone's chase by Elliot Ness and his men. Brian de Palma gets a fine entertaining product with a meticulous direction and a well created atmosphere of the 20's and early 30's in Chicago when Capone was at his peak. The film has tension, the action sequences are well handled and the musical score -though somewhat odd- fits enough.Kevin Costner is correct as Elliot Ness but the acting ""coup de force"" is between Sean Connery (as Malone) and Robert de Niro (as Capone), both outstanding in their characters; de Niro is perhaps the best in a role that has had excellent performers in pictures such as Rod Steiger, Ben Gazzara and Jason Robards. Good jobs too from Andy Garcìa and Charles Martin Smith as Costner's sidekick lawmen. Billy Drago looks mean enough as Frank Nitti.The famous sequence at the train station (baby and stairs included) is not a highlight to me for I found it definitely too slow and long and the same with the sequence when Ness goes after Nitti at he Court House. Clear overrunning of some particular sequences is a usual characteristic in de Palma's films and no one knows why (Craig Wasson following Deborah Shelton through a mall in ""Body Double"" and Angie Dickinson and the man at the art museum in ""Dressed to Kill"", both being perfect examples).But all in all ""The Untouchables"" is a fine and enjoyable crime and gangsters movie.

Fantastic movie that brings us back to the 30's,I don't know if Al Capone was like he was in the film or Elliot Ness was such a 100% good and dutiful man. I don't care because for me it's not a documentation film. But it could have been this way and I enjoy the idea. A movie (a good one) shouldn't be too close and slavish to historical reality. So it can create it's own little world and we can wallow in it. And it's a pleasure to wallow in THE UNTOUCHABLES. We get a fantastic view of how the situation in Chicago during the 30's could have been. I myself believe that it was right that way. But apart from that: what the story makes from the historical plot is absolutely spell binding. I can't take my eyes from the screen even for a moment. That doesn't happen very often to me. Robert De Niro is unbelievable as Al Capone. So is Sean Connery. And so are the others. Only Kevin Kostner as Elliot Ness is a little bit too dutiful from my point of view.

One former comment stated that Robert de Niro didn't play the role of Al Capone but the role of Robert de Niro.

Or even worse: He played James Bond, disguised as a Chicago cop. Once again the script is to blame: It doesn't give us the slightest hint, why an ordinary cop, who is doing street patrols, should suddenly become the leader of a ""gang"", which challenges the all-mighty villain Al Capone and his unscrupulous hitmen.

A mobster movie with more...,"Brian De Palma is known as a director who likes to let the blood flow, but he does more than that in this film. This film outdoes his earlier Scarface in nearly every way - namely, the actors have more of an opportunity to act, the score is better, the action is less drawn-out, etc. One notable difference in his style is his reliance on the perspective of the Untouchables, and not of Capone's men. In giving more screen time to the good guys, he allows some beautiful shots to enter the foray; but don't think that he has completely abandoned violence. It is here as well, and plays a vital role in the film, but is pushed to the background most of the time.Kevin Costner (in one of his early roles) stars as Eliot Ness, the leader of the so-called Untouchables, a branch of the government responsible for nabbing the bootleggers in 1930s Chicago (and elsewhere, though the Windy City is the sole focus here.) He is very convincing as Ness, and De Palma does a great job at showing his early rejection, his first triumphs, and his ultimate success. De Palma also makes Ness' work seem more personal, because he has a wife and children for whom to care.Sir Sean Connery gives one of his best performances in recent times as Jimmy Malone, who somewhat reluctantly joins Ness in his crusade against the bootleggers. As a hard-nosed cop with decades of experience, he is essential to the Untouchables and their mission. His performance understandably earned him an Oscar.The other actors are also well-cast, especially Robert De Niro, who is famous for his mobster roles. His part as Al Capone does not get much screen time, but the time that he is in the picture is perfectly captured.Special mention must be made of the score by Ennio Morricone, surely the greatest and most prolific composer of film music. As in most of the films that he scores, the music becomes an essential part of the work; not only do certain scenes become firmly implanted in your mind, but also his music for each scene. He received an Oscar nomination for this film, but did not win (he has never won, despite six nominations.)I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It is unique in its perspective, the images are not excessively violent, and the score is outstanding. Consider this De Palma's good-guy gangster film, and a must-see.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Chicago way,"""The Untouchables"" focuses on the efforts of investigator Eliot Ness to topple crime syndicate leader Al Capone in Prohibition-era Chicago. The film exaggerates the role of Eliot Ness and his loyal sidekicks, ""The Untouchables"" in disrupting Capone's activities and takes other liberties with history. The film nicely captures the look of Prohibition-era Chicago and Ennio Morricone's score is memorable and appropriate.Kevin Costner is decent as Eliot Ness, the man leading the efforts against Capone. Robert De Niro is seen relatively little as Al Capone, but makes an impression in the scenes he is in. My favorite performance in the film was that of Sean Connery as the street-smart policeman who tutors Ness on the ""right"" way to fight Capone. The supporting performances were notable as well, particularly Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia as members of ""The Untouchables"" and Richard Bradford as the chief of Chicago police.The story has enough turns to prevent it from becoming generic and is generally engaging.

The GREATEST period gangster film ever,"Forget ""Miller's Crossing"", this is the greatest period gangster film ever. Brian De Palma has delivered a top notch film here. Everything in it is at the top of its game. The score is fantastic, as well is the writing.The acting is top notch. This film tells the tale of Al Capone , the vicious and sadistic gang lord of Chicago in the 1920's (played EXCELLENTLY by Robert De Niro). Capone runs everything and everyone in the city. No one will stand up to him. But one man has the courage. That man is Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner in the role he was born to play). Elliot Ness is portrayed as a man who believes in good and truth, and a man who wants to clean up a dirty town. While he is good of heart, he is naive about how to do it. He meets a man named Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery in the role that finally won him a much deserved Oscar). Malone , much like Ness, has a good heart but unlike Ness, he knows how to fight Capone. He schools Ness in the way to get Capone: shoot fast and shoot first! After Ness assembles a gang of men with morals like his called ""The Untouchables"" , the wage their righteous war on Capone and his henchman. Everything about this film is excellent. But the man who owned this film was Kevin Costner. He has had plenty of experience playing heroic good guys, but this is his performance. No one else seems right for this role. He plays Ness as an everyday man who decides to do some good in a bad town. Hats off to Andy Garcia, who plays one Of Ness' best friends George Stone, a straight arrow, loyal memeber of Ness' gang.

A good gangster film but not a great one,"The Untouchables is just one of those movies that I just don't think is as good as it's made out to be. As a gangster movie it's pretty far away from the best the genre has to offer. I don't think it's a poor film by any means but I just can never get involved in it as much as I hope I will. It may be down to that fact that this is only really partially a gangster film. Al Capone and his cohorts really only play a relatively minor role in proceedings, the focus is squarely on the four law enforcement men. This is a problem for me seeing as Capone is by far the most interesting character in the film. The 'Untouchables' themselves are a strangely bland foursome that just aren't terribly great characters to base this film around. If the picture had dedicated more time to Capone, it would have been a great deal more compelling in my opinion.Where the movie does work for me is in the Union Station set-piece. Brian De Palma has always been a director very much at home with cinematic stylistics, and this scene is him at his most showy. But it certainly works and it's a very well choreographed bit of action cinema. This, coupled with the rooftop chase are probably the highlights of the film as a whole. This should give you an indication that The Untouchables is a film that is more interested in thrilling the audience than giving them an authentic historical crime drama. I think maybe that's part of the problem that this movie has in that its peers in the gangster genre have often been so good that The Untouchables pales somewhat in comparison. It seems throwaway when compared to The Godfather or Goodfellas, while it lacks the sheer uncompromising attack of De Palma's earlier film Scarface. It's ultimately a good film but nothing more.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Untouchables,"This film is very Hollywood. It's not historically accurate or anything of that sort. So if you are expecting that then don't view it. But if you are expecting to view a great action film that in modern day standards is cheesy then you will definitely love viewing this one. The film is about Elliot Ness and AL Capone. Played by Kevin Costner and Robert DeNiro. Both of these actors give out fine performances in this film, as well as Sean Connery and Andy Garcia, who was very new to the acting business at the time of the film. The film tells the story of how Elliot Ness did whatever was necessary to take down Capone and his underworld mafia. Great film to watch and enjoy but not one for the history books.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good Not Great,"While the movie has some great scenes, they are few and far between enough for boredom to set in. But don't fear, Brian De Palma's trademark blood and guts (And yes even brains) should be enough to make you squirm. De Niro traditionally bulked up for his role, but doesn't seem to have his heart in it, as much as in other roles anyways. Costner plays Ness well, if Ness was in fact an unemotional stiff. Connery saves it from being unwatchable. Is also filmed in sepia tones, to give effect of 1930's. Only added to my declining interest. Basically, a ""guy's movie"". Women beware.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Kevin Costner is ridiculously over-dramatic playing Elliot Ness.  The movie is filled with long drawn-out scenes, most of which are totally stupid. The scene in the train station with the baby carriage going down the stairs is one of the silliest things I have ever seen in a movie.Typical is the scene where Sean Connery scares the bad-guy into a confession by riddling an already dead guy full of bullets.

'The Untouchables' is a great film in the fact that it combines action with a brilliantly-executed storyline. A riveting story that I recommend to all fans of gangster films.

Smooth and Exciting,"Just watched this story a week ago, there are a bit information of this film I remember.A piece of story based on the life of a mafia boss legend in the era of 30-40's in Chicago, Al Capone(Robert De Niro). But the focus one in this film is a police agent, Eliot Ness(Kevin Costner) as the main character. It's about the effort of Eliot in bringing Al Capone to the justice department for many crimes were made by him.I'm not sure if this film really based 100% on true story as I don't follow that much on Al Capone's cases. Next, back into the story. Two hours given was satisfying the feeling. A calm story line and not too rush. And it's given me to feel the worry and nervousness that felt by the main character and the other protagonists.Character building is pretty good for me which the main character are struggling on his shameful working performance at the beginning of story and start to rise in the fight to take down Al Capone. A bit disappointment, Al Capone's character seems not to be given a chance to emerge his evilness in the film instead Frank Nitti(Billy Drago) is more evil as Nitti is simply the sidekick that responsible for dirtying his hand to make sure the hands of big boss is always clean. Maybe because of this is a true story and nearly end of the power of Al Capone in Chicago. So only that little things could be shown there. In addition at the beginning scene, the dirty hand of Nitti was the cause of making me shocked and thought that he is the person that should be kicked in the ass than Al Capone.The action that will keep to be remembered of course at the shooting scene at the train station that shows in amazing slow motion. The excitement is so tasty. The cinematography that matches with the west/American fashion in the setting of time around 30-40's making me felt like watching a 60's Hollywood film in color, just my feeling only.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Despite violence I still love this film,"You must realize I was shocked to find how much I loved this movie being that generally I'm not a fan of mobster movies and additionally I don't have a high tolerance for graphic violence (with which this movie abounds) I think the fact that it still managed to make a devoted fan out of me is a testament to how gripping and well done this movie is. Part of it has to do with the casting certainly. Kevin Costner was born to play Ness, it seems to me! I don't often find he fits into the roles he plays in his movies but here he is powerful and yet human and you can really feel his pain and frustration throughout. I love Sean Connery in general and here he is in classic form playing a strong, growling Irish cop with a big chip on his shoulder and a lot of heart hidden beneath his gruff exterior. I think everyone agrees De Niro as Capone was incredible casting, no need to say more on that. The score was a perfect fit as well, lending a sense of urgency and foreboding without stealing the whole scene.

Decent crime/cop film.,"The film has been remastered on 4K and it's a good looking transfer. Robert De Niro is pretty underutilised in this film and Kevin Costner plays a very straight laced and plain character which is a shame as he's the protagonist but he doesn't really show much emotion, Sean Connery actually has all the good lines and moments. The story is based on some truth but has been completely Hollywoodized and fictionalised, the film has some nice costumes, old vintage cars, etc, it's clearly a high budget movie, but some of the music is so old fashioned, some of the action sequences are almost comical in that you think it might be a parody. I guess they are trying to recreate old 1940s gangster films but it just comes off as very stale and dated and pandering more to children than adults with the grand heroics and swirling music. The Structure of the film is quite predictable, you know that the Kevin Costner character will meet up with the older wiser Connery character and even have to go beyond the law in order to get his man. The scenes with his wife and daughter are extremely and painfully old fashioned and American apple pie, again in it's defence possibly it's trying to hark back to old 1940s classics but a film like Chinatown showed you could do a period film without needing to fall back on all these old cliches. Even some of the better aspects to it like the harmonica music for the villain hitman was copied from Once Upon a Time in the West. I think it's agreed the train station scene is well done though.

Stylish and fun...if outdated,"Truth be told, I was very disappointed by The Untouchables when I first saw it. As part of a crime movie marathon I was going through (which included Casino, The Godfather, and Goodfellas) this was definitely the worst of the night. Confused by its' high ratings, I searched around on the internet trying to find out what was so good about it. I mean, certain films don't suit certain people, but I was sure I knew a good crime flick when I saw one. Then I discovered my mistake. What I expected was a fact-based account of the dealings and on-goings of Al Capone, and the men who ended up stopping him. I wanted to be submerged in the 1920's life of suits, hats and tommy guns. What I instead watched was a movie that overglorified one 'untouchable' and focused only on his life and on-goings. There was corniness all over and cheesy characters. I only really liked two parts: the opening credits, and the baseball bat scene. There were only a few clips of Al Capone, and in those rare moments it seemed as though I was watching a different movie.Turns out, it doesn't help finding out a bit about a movie before you watch it. What 'The Untouchables' actually is, is a fictional and classy noir-style film. Plus, it is titled 'The Untouchables' and not 'Al Capone', and there were high review of the movie all around. Because of this, I decided to give it another chance.My second viewing was far more enjoyable than the first. Now appreciating it for what it was, most of the cheese had turned into style. Ennio Morricone's score really captures the noir-style feel of the film. The performances are great, especially Robert De Niro as Capone. When I first discovered that he played the part, I was in chuckles. Not because I didn't think he could do it, but because I thought that the role choice was strange. But my, how much range thins man has got! De Niro really makes the cahacter his own, giving Capone a fierceness that is nesseccary so that he becomes a solid character in the few scenes that he is in. The plot is pretty much told side by side from Eliot Ness' story with Al Capone's, until they both clash in court.I appriciated a lot of scenes more the second time, too. The pram scene, court scene, and the death of Jim Malone all stood out, among every part with Robert De Niro. Its not a perfect film, however, especially when it comes to classic 80's cheese. For example, the ambush on the bridge was accompanied by, in my opinion, inappropriate music. 'Strength of the righteous' took out any tension that was built up prior to the attack. I'm not a big fan of the ending, either – Had I put all my family in danger and lost two close friends in order to take down a crime boss I certainly wouldn't be saying ""I think I'll have a drink"".However, there were far less complaints from me after my second viewing, and this has become one of my personal favorites when it comes to crime movies.Final Word: StylishMy rating: 7/10Full Review: http://cineranter.wordpress.com/2012/04/08/movie-review- the-untouchables/",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
James Cagney would be proud,"Back in the 1930s, the gangster film was considered the most critically and commercially successful genre for studios to invest in, probably because so much of what was shown on screen rang so close to home and seemed very real to its contextual audience. Warner Brothers stood at the forefront of this revolution, almost solely on the back of James Cagney, an actor who made a life out of portraying 'tough guy' Americanised Mafiosi, and creating the archetypal figure that forms in the mind of modern-day audiences when they hear the word 'gangster.' With The Untouchables, Brian De Palma has directed an excellent homage to Cagney's crime classics, synchronising the plot and script of those films with a modern self- reflexive undertone not unlike that used in fellow 80's noir thriller Blade Runner.The film stars Kevin Costner as Federal Agent Elliot Ness and is set in Prohibition-era Chicago. Al Capone (Robert De Niro) rules the streets, supplying illegal alcohol to those who want it and bribing those who don't. Contrary to popular belief, the film's title refers not to the criminals, but the small team Ness assembles to combat this corruption, including ageing cop Jim Malone (Sean Connery, in an Oscar-winning role), accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) and newbie George Stone (Andy Garcia).As mentioned above, The Untouchables applies a plot formula used an infinite amount of times since the 1930s: the confrontation of good versus evil, and how the pursuit of victory impacts each side. In fact, the plot is not the only convention De Palma has adapted from the earliest of crime films. The production crew pulls out all the stops to add authenticity to the setting, from the buildings, to the cars, to the clothes (legend has it De Niro tracked down Al Capone's personal tailor and asked him to design his wardrobe). But the biggest wink to the audience is delivered through the characters and indeed, the script itself.Through the first, say, half hour of The Untouchables, you might find yourself questioning its reputation as a respected classic. Much of the dialogue appears cheesy, and the characters over-the-top in their delivery and general mannerisms. However, as the film progresses, it becomes clear that it was written in such a way as to appear like a movie straight out of the Depression years (where characters seemed excessively emotive and outlandish in their behaviour by today's standards); and the sooner that is understood, the more enjoyable and engaging one will find the movie.Within this delightful script is a multitude of likable, well-developed characters. Connery's imposing presence and husky voice made him an excellent choice for the no-nonsense Malone, but it is arguably De Niro who delivers the best performance. Used sparingly, he makes the most of his screen time with the best dialogue of any character, seamlessly shifting his character's demeanour from charming (cracking jokes with members of the press) to macabre (all I have to say is: 'baseball, gentlemen!').Finally, the camera is used in often-breathtaking fashion throughout the film. Long tracking shots build suspense, and the camera's involvement in a particular scene involving an assassination was (for me, at least) the turning point from which the film excelled from good to great. And although it has since become Scorsese who has made the steadycam shot a key weapon in his arsenal (think entering the Copacabana in Goodfellas), De Palma uses it to excellent effect, some three years earlier than Marty's triumph, no less. And by the climax, everything combines to form De Palma's best film. And remember, this man made Scarface.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The most overrated movie I've ever seen in my life...,"I'm a big fan of this genre. However, a 7.8 on the imdb ratings is preposterous. This movie is led by the always extremely bland and dull actor that is Kevin Costner, who wouldn't know what emotions meant if it slapped him in the face. The camera work is a joke and it's a comic book movie at most, but in no way should this be confused with masters such as Scarface, The Godfather, Goodfellas, Carlito's Way, etc. Sean Connery is great in this movie and he's about the only one. Don't make me laugh about Andy Garcia, who too, knows how to be a paper cardboard wooden actor, such as Costner is well known for. Does it take much to put some emotions into your acting abilities? Kevin Costner is sincerely the highest overrated actor in history of this industry. How he even has a job in Hollywood is beyond me. Sorry, De Palma, but this one is a dud.

"A Brilliant,Unnforgettable Classic That Mixes Crime Drama,Gangter Film And Action And One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. Brian De Palma At His Best.","The Untouchables is a brilliant,stylish and unforgettable classic and one of the greatest films ever made. Filled with excellent direction,a great cast,a powerful film score,an amazing script and fantastic cinematography,The Untouchables is Brian De Palma,Crime Drama and Cinema at it's best.Based on the television series and book of the same name and set in Chicago,Illnois in the 1930s during prohibition,The Untouchables tells the story of Elliot Ness(Kevin Costner),a Federal agent in the Treasury Department who has been brought to Chicago to stop the flow of illegal liquor and to stop gangster crime boss Al Capone(Robert De Niro). After finding little success,Elliot enlists the help of veteran Chicago Cop Jim Malone(Sean Connery)to help form a team of cops called The Untouchables to get Capone. Now,with the help of two other cops Oscar Wallace(Charles Martin Smith)and George Stone(Andy Garcia),Elliot and Jim prepare to take down Capone at all costs and do it the Chicago way.The Untouchables is one of those excellent films that is an instant classic from beginning to end and is a film that you will never forget and it's also a film where everything the direction,the writing,cast and score just seems to work in a flawless way. The Untouchables is an epic Crime Drama that pulls into the world of the violent prohibition era of the 1930s in Chicago where violence is the name of the game and the only law in Chicago is a gun and money and gangsters rule the world. The Untouchables is great film because of the way it rewrites history and takes real life characters(Elliot Ness,Al Capone)and puts them in a fictional tale that feels very real but in a cinematic way and everything in the film is bigger than life. I know that some critics and viewers have complained about this film not being very realistic or true to real life events or facts but The Untouchables is a movie of entertainment not a documentary. The Untouchables is a great Gangster film and one of the few Gangster films where the events is mostly told from the cops point of view and not the Gangsters and instead of rooting for the gangsters you are rooting for the cops in a battle of good and evil and you want The Untouchables to win. The Cinematography by Stephen H. Burum is beautiful and visually stunning,with Burum bringing a stylish feel to the film where the atmosphere is dark with harsh lighting at night with blue colors and beautiful orange and yellow lighting during the day while bringing an accurate feel of Chicago in the 1930s. Flawlessly,The Untouchables balances out the light and dark not just with the characters but with the cinematography. The main characters Elliot Ness and Jim Malone are great because it's almost like a Father and son relationship where Jim is trying to teach Elliot the ways of how Chicago works and how you get Al Capone. Where as Elliot wants to do everything within the law,Jim tells Elliot to do it the Chicago way with a gun and aggressiveness and take Al Capone down that way. The relationship between Elliot and Jim is truly classic and will stay with you. Al Capone in The Untouchables is portrayed as being larger than life a gangster who rules the city of Chicago with a gun and iron hand but is loved by the media because of his charisma and quotes but underneath that charisma is a guy that is evil and brutal and will kill you when he gets the chance. Capone in this film is evil personified. The screenplay by David Mamet is excellent and memorable,with Mamet giving the main characters tough and gritty dialog that reflects Chicago but is also done in Mamet's masterful style and most of the great scenes with Mamet's dialog is classic and doesn't miss a beat. The Action and gunfight scenes in the film are great and electrifying because each Action scene is done with fantastic build-up and suspense and when the Action happens you are on the edge of your seat especially the Train station scene which in my opinion is one of the best Action scenes in movie history. The ending of The Untouchables is wonderful and will have you cheering at the screen and is one of the many reasons The Untouchables is an amazing classic.The whole cast is amazing. Kevin Costner is brilliant as Elliot Ness,with Costner bringing optimism,toughness and depth to the role. Sean Connery earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his excellent performance as Jim Malone. Connery brings grit,humor and greatness to the role and has great chemistry and scenes with Costner. Charles Martin Smith is wonderful as Agent Oscar Wallace,an accountant. Andy Garcia is fantastic as George Stone,a cop that is a great sharpshooter. Robert De Niro is amazing and at his best as Al Capone,with De Niro bringing charisma and pure evil to the role. Billy Drago is great and unforgettable as Frank Nitti,a Capone guard and assassin Richard Bradford(Police Chief Mike Dorsett),Jack Kehoe(Walter Payne),Brad Sullivan(George),Patricia Clarkson(Catherine Ness),Vito D'Ambrosio(Bow-tie Driver)and Steven Goldstein(Scoop)give good performances as well.The direction by Brian De Palma is brilliant and stylish,with De Palma always moving the camera using great camera angles as well as zooms and close-ups and giving the film a masterful visual style. Great direction,De Palma.The score by Ennio Morricone is excellent,epic,powerful and one of the greatest scores in movie history. Morricone's score is big,stylish and unforgettable and fits in with the tone of the movie and matches every scene in the film and raises the film to a higher level. Another masterful score from Morricone.In final word,if you love Brian De Palma,Crime Dramas,Gangster Films or films in general,I highly suggest you see The Untouchables,a brilliant and unforgettable classic that will stand the test of time and is a film that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""You can't touch this!""","This wasn't bad at all. It may perhaps be a somewhat simplified version of the events and not strictly true to the actual events and I'm sure it would be much bloodier and filled with characters that don't show their true colours until later and probably more factually accurate if it was made today, but it got the story across well and it didn't take too much brain power to understand. I like it that way, too much cloak and dagger can detract from what is just a good story.Al Capone's downfall at the hands of Elliot Ness and his Untouchables (Sounds a bit rude doesn't it?) is given appropriate time and pacing, with good actors and direction. The costumes are good and the sets are well chosen. It's obvious that they had a good budget. It does still contain some bloody violence, but not necessarily in a gratuitous way. It's certainly not the sole focus, despite De Palma being renowned for his bloody flicks. I'm a big scaredy-cat so if I can deal with it, it can't be that bad.Does it make Elliot look somewhat lost until he recruits Malone, Stone and t'other one? Yes it does a bit and it seems a bit lead by Malone rather than Ness, who doesn't appear to have known where to start. That may just be how the film portrays him. Sean was the bigger star at the time after all, but I don't know how it all really went down, because I wasn't there. I've just heard of the Legend of Elliot Ness, but not of Malone.
According to the IMDB Trivia section ""t'other one"" wasn't even present for the events.Robert gives a fantastic performance as Capone and stands out for that. Kevin is ok, but a bit wet and Garcia is surprisingly handsome, which I've never said before. No one does a bad job as acting goes.
Sean however frustrates me. He's reputed as this fantastic actor with numerous awards yet he has never, to my knowledge, succeeded in doing any accent other than his own. Why then does he get a part as an Irish-American. Was it for his name, was it because they don't care that Irish and Scottish don't sound the same or did they genuinely believe he sounded Irish? It's one thing that bugs me in films, when you have someone playing a role that they cannot do the accent for. If you're going for realistic, you've got to ensure this is correct. I have no issue with anyone playing a part that they weren't born in to, but I do expect them to work hard to produce the best version of that character, otherwise what are they getting those big bucks for? Allegedly De Niro wore similar undies to Capone just to get in to character, did Sean even know that he was supposed to be Irish? I'm sure he didn't know what type of pants Malone wore. In fairness, if you forget that he's not a Scottish immigrant, he's actually quite good in the role.I've seen better ""Gangster"" films, but this one was easy to watch and an interesting story to start with.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A flawed, yet tense gangster movie","The Untouchables - Brian De Palma 1987Elliot Ness l, Treasury man is brought in to crack down on organised crime in 30s Chicago. It's a great yet flawed movie. Lots of classic scenes and good performances from the leads, surprisingly Sean Connery got his one and only Oscar for this, his performance is pretty ordinary it's not great at all( far better in The Hill from 1965)

"Spectacular film, even with plenty historical inaccuracies","The Untouchables has always been one of my favourite films of all times, and my favourite of de Palma's (more so than even Scarface).Every single scene and set piece is perfect, and the acting on another level.In my opinion, out of the three main actors (de Niro, Costner and Connery), I think the person who won the Oscar actually gave the worst performance. De Niro cements himself, in my mind, as the greatest actor of all time. A reputation perhaps sullied in more recent times, but his overall oeuvre and range of his work is second to none.Connery, however, is still great and for a lifetime of work, the Oscar is deserved. I'm just not sure it was deserved more so than his two co-stars.The music here, by the elite Ennio Morricone, another Oscar winner, also contributes and elevates every scene.David Lynch has a reputation for precision and perfection in his directing. De Palma, in my mind, was the original perfectionist and, while his more recent output is not up there with his early work, should be considered one of the greatest directors of all time. Freeze any scene at any point and everything there serves a purpose. Nothing is out of place.Why I'm taking one point off is the historical inaccuracies. I wish I could take this film purely as an entertainment, but I think it does disservice to many of those who were instrumental in bringing down Capone by putting all the focus on one man. History be damned because this film will be what people remember most about Eliot Ness and Al Capone and that's a shame.Finally, my favourite scene in the Naked Gun films is directly a spoof on this, and I love this film all the more for leading to that!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Occasionally Entertaining and Clunky,"Uneven with some great flourishes and some unwelcome clunk. The Director's visual flare is evident everywhere and the Movie's look is impressive. But there are other things that bring down the Cool Artistic touches.There is very little Mamet-Speak and the Dialog can sometimes feel very awkward. Speaking of awkward, Costner gives another DoDo Bird outing that gives even more credence that this Man is, and never was, a candidate for a Lead Actor.There is some dazzle here, mostly with the Movie Camera and some trademark bloody Violence, the Musical Score cuts its way into the proceedings with some striking Staccato, and there is enough visual appeal to make this an attractively mounted Period Play.But then there are the misfires like the the Canadian Scene and probably the worst, the Courtroom Ending that is confusing and boring.

Am I The Only One Who Notices These Things?,"I don't want to spend a lot of time on a full review of this movie, but there is one aspect of the film that I think bears inspection: Like a lot of movies today, the hero takes the moral highground by refusing to act in an unprincipled manner - only to throw away all his integrity at the end of the film.  Apparently, behaving in an unprincipled and viscious manner is not only 'the Chicago way', but also the only way to elicit applause from an audience.

A compelling Good guy vs Bad guy plot,"A compelling, and classically structured good guy vs bad guy plot with plenty of action.Throughout the film, each time we see Capone he displays a range of characteristics. He is pompous, arrogant, intimidating, flamboyant and ruthless in all of his endeavours (particularly when wielding a baseball bat)- Robert De Niro secures himself as a frighteningly believable Al Capone - even down to the hand gestures, facial sneers and the silk underwear. (apparently Capone was a fan of wearing them)On Capone's side, Billy Drago's portrayal of Nitti has to be mentioned. From his villainous smile to the striking white suit ensemble - Nitti is one to watch out for. Despite his characters lack of dialogue, he stands out amongst this star-studded cast.Sean Connery plays Jim Malone, a wise bobby on the beat, and the oldest recruit of 'The Untouchables'. His Irish accent was somewhat questionable, though his wit and Mr Miagi styled performance distract from this. A well deserved Oscar win for Best Supporting Actor.Kevin Costner's straight- laced performance as Eliot Ness has to be commended, alongside Andy Garcia as the slick Italian and Charles Martin Smith as the eager and loveable character of Oscar.The most attractive thing about this film is the score (composed by Ennio Morricone.) The arrangements work fantastically in the film, creating feelings of triumphant joy in certain scenes, to sheer suspense. A particularly memorable piece is the ""Machine Gun Lullaby"" which plays during the slow motion train station shootout. (An iconic scene)I really appreciated the creeper sequence inside Malones house (can't say much more without spoiling the plot)The only downside of this film is the special effects/stunts - given the year it was made its obviously not high-tech or sophisticated in comparison to recent film.This is one of the first films I remember watching when I was younger & it's still up there with my absolute favourites - despite being made 33 years ago.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A quality period gangster movie from the man behind ""Scarface""","Brian De Palma's ""The Untouchables"" is loosely based on the 1950's TV show of the same name. It follows the exploits of federal agent Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner), who leads a small group of 'untouchable' cops in an operation designed to topple the empire of Chicago mob boss Al Capone (Robert De Niro).The movie has a unique feel, which probably isn't for everyone. If you're expecting a serious crime drama like ""GoodFellas"" or ""The Godfather"", you won't find it here. Yet, the movie is violent enough to sport a well-earned 'R' rating. Ultimately, what differentiates ""The Untouchables"" from most other gangster movies is a deft admixture of action, humour and even nostalgia. To be honest, it took me a few viewings before I warmed up to the movie but now I appreciate its unique spin on this well-worn material.The cast is one of the movie's strong suits. The producers paid a high price for Robert De Niro but it was worth every penny. He delivered a larger than life performance and figured prominently in the movie's most memorable scene. Sean Connery was no slouch, either, winning an Oscar for his portrayal of Malone, the aging beat cop who educates Ness in the ways of Chicago. Kevin Costner's star-making performance is a good one as he was well-suited to playing the stiff, morally upright Ness. Charles Martin Smith provided a welcome dose of comic relief and a young Andy Garcia rounded out the titular squad. Other notable performances came from a memorably villainous Billy Drago and Patricia Clarkson as Ness's devoted wife.The direction by Brian De Palma shows masterful control and a keen eye throughout. Hitchcockian touches are in evidence at times and the climactic shootout includes a classic homage to Eisenstein's ""Battleship Potemkin"". Ennio Morricone's score is also well done but I think that it has a bit of a glossy 80's feel that I'm not too fond of. As for other areas of the production, the convincing period costumes and sets both deserve special mention.In the end, although ""The Untouchables"" delivers fairly lightweight entertainment it does so with quality acting, direction and production values. It may not be perfect but it's definitely good enough to warrant its status as a classic. The only thing standing in the way of an unqualified recommendation is the movie's overall tone, which skews more towards action/adventure than crime drama, potentially to the disappointment of gangster movie fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
De Palma's magic,"Flipping through the channels I came across a film just starting, and its music alone hooked me as the actor's names passed across the screen.  From there I found more and more reasons to keep watching, mucho thanks to film-scoring legend of Ennio Morricone for bringing me into the world of the Untouchables.De Palma's always been a director who keeps me on my toes.  I love one of his movies, hate the next, feel eh' about the next after that.  He's daring and different, I'll give him that, but generally his movies don't score to high with me (especially if he overuses split screens).Untouchables is a more normal/traditional in its look and feel compared to typical De Palma material that's bursting with avant guard artistic style, and a more normal film seems like the right way to go with this material. Of course, when I say `normal/traditional' I'm not saying it's boring Hollywood formula.  This is De Palma we're talking about.  And yes, he still directs with awe-inspiring flair particularly in the raids sequences.  One of the final major sequences in the movie - the hunt for Capone's bookkeeper involves a particularly brilliant shootout on the steps of a subway.  The camera work, actors performances, and Morricone's music merge beautifully and seamlessly - everything moves with crystal clarity in narration while never losing a stylish touch.All the characters may be the typical team you see assembled in similar films; however, the actors' performances rise above the stereotype potential and play their characters with just enough believability that they're something more.  I like Kevin Costner as Elliot Ness, the simple wholesome man in the middle of a war he'd rather not be in but has sworn to fight.  I really sympathized with him and his family.  Sean Connery deserved his Oscar for his portrayal of the streetwise and cunning Jim Malone; the interactions between Ness and Malone carried an interesting wit about them that left me grinning every time the two would exchange words.Robert De Niro is a delight as the infamous and carefree Al Capone with his over-the-to showboating to the media.  Nods to Andy Garcia and Charles Martin-Smith with less to do, but still make the most of their screen time.I had a lot of fun with the Untouchables, and as of right now it's probably my favorite De Palma film.",,Anonymous,Crime
Dated and flawed yet very entertaining,"There are many problems with The Untouchables; the clunky screenplay, the wooden acting and the laughably melodramatic score.

There are moments so bad (Connery's heroic marathon crawl stands out) that it almost feels like a spoof at times but I still find the movie enjoyable and engaging.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

People seem to hate Kevin Costner. But I believe he did a great job as Ness. I also give credit to Sean Connery. He's a wonderful actor. I just wish Robert De Niro had more screen time as Capone.

The Unkemptables,"An uncompromising style was lit by The Godfather and refuelled by Goodfellas during the 20th century; anything in the before or during stage of the two ceased to exist in masterpiece terms for very long. The idea to simply make a mob movie a cop drama revolving around Al Capone seems to be feigning the notion that true gangsters can still be told the other side of the fence effectively. They can't, or rather this can't half as well as it could have.It's all smothered in the look though. Perfected haircuts, brandished liquor, breathed mists of cigar lit mercy, so in the respect of playing the era, it is the best character to be found – though Connery also gives it enough reason to watch (unsurprisingly). Costner, also playing a mostly straight laced, no nonsense police officer along with two other 'characters' who form the untouchables.Admirable though it is to detract from the mob lifestyle, to show segments of it that seem to have no use except characterisation is cruel. Especially when the tension and style is carried with it, in sweet but short blips. Costner also can't seem to entirely stray from his Western prime either, that segment feels nothing more than a word in from himself or a hastily added diversion from the office scenery. Biased though this is coming from a gangster fan, fellow police drama Zodiac worked brilliantly and that was as ambiguous as you could hope for.In short, if the last twenty minutes had been as good as what preceded it then this would have been a more than welcome change in perspective. Turns out it isn't.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Unrepaired!,"This movie is the perfect example of having a good premise and high production values yet having bad execution. The story is about Treasury officer Eliot Ness' recruitment of 'untouchables' and their work in defeating crime boss Al Capone. My problem with the movie was it tried to be two things at the same time; a family-friendly epic adventure and a gritty crime drama. The result was a full set of contrived and hokey scenes. There's no character development courtesy of the inane script. The actors spout off one cheesy line after another. Ennio Morricone's musical scores are always top-notch but this time the music doesn't fit quite well. The score sounds too upbeat and silly for the movie's vacillating tone. You also have an uninvolving antagonist in the form of Robert De Niro. All we get from him is long speeches that have nothing to do with the main plot. His scenes didn't advance the story. They only exist to show off De Niro as Capone. Furthermore, Sean Connery's performance isn't Oscar-caliber and Kevin Costner isn't convincing as Ness. Andy Garcia showed promise, but like I mentioned earlier, the screenplay didn't develop him or anybody enough for me to care. And what's worse, you get an implausible resolution set in a court room. It's a fast-paced movie with stylish images but not as great as some might suggest.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Best Gangster movie ever.,"This is a fantastic movie. In my personal opinion this is the best Gangster movie ever. The Godfather trilogy are still excellent movies but they don't make me feel the way this does. A Davd and Goliath battle between a handful of men and the Daddy of all Gangsters - tax evasion has never been so entertaining! The acting is good too. No seriously the acting really is very, very good Sean Connery as always gives brilliant performance, though Costner is on top form and plays his part engagingly and you feel great compassion for all the men involved. Even De Niro is the villain you love to hate though his screen time is limited, you just can't wait for them to bring Al Capone down by the time you reach the last gripping 30 mins. It's also got that famous train station scene which oozes tension like no other film. Despite the Godfather's delicious 'it's good to be bad' approach this experience has you craving for justice to be done - no other film makes you feel this way.

"Doesn't touch deep enough, but....","The Untouchables is a good, but not great, spin off of the classic t.v. show, only now on the big screen, we have more freedom for explosions, grizzly blood scenes, shootouts, and particularly set design, backdrops, and costumes, where the cinematography, and capturing the period, is top notch, but if a little excessive one feels, and I'm not talking just the latter. Of course, a patent example, is the train station shootout, on the stairs. I must say it was cool, but also was kind of really aggravating. I really felt there really could of been more pumped into the story and characters, here with this pic. The story line, where the subject of boot legging, was used, was really a letdown. Watching Costner in this again, as Ness, I really can't say he was good or bad, where honestly I'd be pointing towards the latter, to be frank. His wife, played by the great Patricia Clarkson, was wasted. Connery is just sheer fantastic, in the performance of his career, where the other two of Costner's justice seeking troupe are very good, especially Charles Martin Smith. De Niro, is brilliant of course, in an underrated and unappreciative performance as Al Capone, for what lesser number of scenes he has. I really wish I saw more of him. Another memorable standout with Billy Drago, again as evil remorseless scum, and lead henchman of Deniro's, who takes one might say, a memorable fall, before bloodying it up on his landing. De Palma has some unforgettably memorable, moments, like Costner, newly formed group, taking it to the streets. One really feels, the makers have focused too much on style, sets, whatever, where really the essence of story hasn't cut deep enough, where it's more skimming it's surface, but hey, it's decided to go this way, with the less approach, and in this case, has gotten away with it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Maybe with ancient legends you can take a lot of liberties. But this is the retelling of recent history. And they are doing so much wrong in retelling it. So many of the details are false...there may very well be more falsehoods than truth in the movie. And we are talking about some very big things too. For instance two of the officers who are working together in the film never actually met! And the worst part is that they have the main character kill a man in the movie who he didn't kill in real life, but instead went on to replace al capone as head of his family and then eventually died of natural causes. Where they hell do they get off doing that? What they should have done, if they had the integrity, would be to say that that is what happened after al died at the end of the film. After they say how long al served in jail and how he died...but they don't do any of that! The movie ends with al going to jail, not knowing what happened after that. A very poor ending.So I give this movie a 1-2 for accuracy. Altogether I give it a 6.

Taking Down Al Capone,"Chicago in the 1930's. Prohibition. Crime. Corruption. Gangsters. And standing over it all was the biggest gangster of all: Al Capone, ruthless, heartless and vicious. And taking on Al Capone, devoting himself to the task, was Treasury man Elliott Ness and his team, known as ""The Untouchables."" This movie is very loosely based on those historical events, and is also in lineage with an old TV series of the same name. It's no history lesson, but it does give a bit of a taste of the era and - most important for a movie - it's entertaining. It's pretty graphic at times, and at other times it manages to be humorous. From time to time it even brings out an emotional reaction in the viewer.I give credit to the cast. The movie featured strong performances all round. As Ness and Capone, Kevin Costner and Robert de Niro were excellent, and Sean Connery (in an Oscar winning turn) shone as Ness's associate Malone.The atmosphere of the movie was excellent, especially in portraying the extent of the corruption in the city at the time: from police to the judiciary and all the way to the mayor. It was actually pretty sobering in that sense. As well done as it was, my only criticism would be that it seems to only barely scratch the surface of Capone's criminal empire, and his trial seems anti-climactic. Otherwise, it's very well done.

"Good, but not great","I used to love this film the few times I saw it when I was a kid.  Now, after watching it again, I can't help but feel that something was missing with the movie.  It is this missing link that really prevents this film from being a great movie.Don't get me wrong, I really like The Untouchables.  The acting is good, with what little script that David Mamet, who is usually a much much better screenwriter has to give them.  Connery, though sounding like a total cliche line after line of dialogue really stands out, in my opinion, one of his best roles ever.  Garcia is also good with what unfortunately turned out to be little more than a standing extra, and of course, Deniro is simply awesome as the Charasmatic and often brutal, Al Capone.  However, Costner, as usual, simply lacks every hint of emotion in his role as Elliot Ness. His 'tough guy' scenes with Capone are more laughable than serious, and his tender acting makes Ness appear to be more of a wuss than the passive-aggressive vigilante who out smarted Capone.What really is missing is hard to place...it's not one big problem, it's a series of small problems that add up.  As mentioned, the weak script and Costner's bad acting are both serious detriments to this film's success. But, there is something else that I can never and could ever put my finger on...it's an extra edge or an extra passion that was missing that really prevented this film to be a true epic.  Also, after reviewing it after ten years, there are so many parts in the action scenes that involve either completely idiotic acts by the characters, or incredibly inconsistent scenes (for instance, in the raid on the liquor convoy, a platoon of mounties on horseback are charging a group of tommy gun clad mobsters who are hosing their guns at them at close range, yet not a single one is hit.  Also, the final scene where Costner looks at the matchbook, finds out his friend's killer is really the same Capone henchman whom he just disarmed AND then rearmed, makes the killer very aware to the fact and is then responsible for the guy going gun crazy in the whole court.  Also, I find it very hard to believe that NOONE heard the gunshots that echoed throughout the courtroom building.  And finally, though cool, the scene with the baby carriage has it's fair share of problems).  Plus, the pacing of the movie was a little too fast...I felt that there were scenes missing that should have been there...scenes that could have been spent with more characterization, and most importantly, the building passion of the team to bring down Capone. There are far too little scenes that convey this passionate desire that we are supposed to be feeling with the characters.But when you add all of this up, surprisingly, it matters little.  With so many flaws, it still turns out to be a good movie with a great score by Ennio Morricone (who has provided scores for dozens of famous movies) and great direction by De Palma, though the pacing seems really choppy at times, and doesn't always flow well.  This film, next to Scarface, is probably De Palma's best effort overall.  It is entertaining and features some cool characters that unfortunately have very limited dialogue.  Overall, not a bad film, but there are much better gangster films out there.  Watch it for Connery, he truly shines.  7.5/10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Into a barrel of cotton. To make a ballistics test. His time there went from ho-hum to frustration. After Capone went to prison, and the Chicago mayor and police force had to find other crooks to sell their services to, Ness went to the hills of Kentucky to hunt for moonshine stills.

Little fun to be had in this first-rate production 5/10,"A smile came to my face every time Sean Connery delivered, rather perfectly I might add, one of his classic racial slurs.  Unfortunately, The Untouchables is an unsatisfying gangster film that is ever-so overrated. Kevin Coster gives an astonishingly lazy performance as Eliot Ness -- in a role that is just wrong for the actor.  Sean Connery -- while perfect in his short role, is not used enough.  Ditto for Andy Garcia and Robert De Niro who just kind of blend with the background.If the film gets anything right, it's the violence.  The Untouchables is a deservedly violent film, with some nice action scenes.  The action scenes however are over-sylized at times (typical De Palma), including a laughable shoot-out that steals from Potemkin.

"Great Story, Okay Film","If this movie were made today then it'd be considered slow.That being said, the movie is compelling but a little cheesy. It's a classic cop action-drama about one of, if not the, most famous gangster. Much like a cop super hero movie with Capone (Robert De Niro) playing a phenomenal bad guy. The suspense scenes were drawn out and the lines were very much written out. Reminiscent of an old cop movie from the 1950's where the stoic cop says something edgy and witty with a stern face. There were some small things that bothered me like very obviously seeing the cameraman in a window or the lack of bullet holes in windows, doors, or the bodies that were shot. It felt like when a bad story teller is the only one that knows the story and is dragging it out unnecessarily long because for once people want to listen to them speak.

A great mob movie.,"The Untouchables is an excellent movie set in 1930's Chicago, showing a fictionalized version of Al Capone's arrest. From the director of the fun, family film Scarface, Untouchables has action and charm and one of the best films in its sub-genre.The Untouchables has style. Everything looks convincing, and we feel transported to the 1930's. The dialogue is entertaining, there's humour that could've been left out for a more serious film but works well, and Robert De Niro plays a gangster.Speaking of De Niro, the characters and acting are superb. Costner is the golden Ness, a genuinely uncompromisable and good person. Connery, in an Oscar-winning role, is great as the old Irish cop who doesn't let rules get in the way, in one of the most shocking, brutal and awesome moments. And De Niro... he's one of the best ever, and the Untouchables is no exception. The dinner scene.Like the more current Inglorious Basterds, the action in Untouchables is mostly quick and brutal, carried out by a few men. All the gunfire and violence has 'oomph' to it, and some scenes are gripping, specifically the train station. My chest was tight for ten minutes after it was done.A great movie deserving of a spot on the 250, The Untouchables is a top-tier mob movie that should be seen by fans of the genre, De Niro, or history.

A classic crime thriller,"The story is one of legend: Al Capone prohibition era reign is brought down by crusading Treasury agent Elliot Ness. What makes this better than any other version? Many factors. Firstly the director is one of the greats (when he's on target). De Palma has his weaknesses but he is technically proficient and excellent at creating tension in set pieces. Here he creates a spirit of adventure in the character of Ness but also delivers several very tense scenes where the action is slowly built up to.Secondly the story is strong enough to keep the interest throughout - you know the story but the style of telling is slick and the characters draw you in. It is a fascinating tale of the times, even when it has been fictionalised like this.The main factor looking back is the strength of the cast from top to bottom. Costner (before his career imploded) is excellent as Ness, the righteous man pushed over the limits of his morality in his quest to do right, and shows the internal struggle going on inside well. De Niro enjoys himself as the unpredictable Capone and many of his scenes here have become part of everyone's knowledge (the baseball bat!). Garcia and Martin Smith do well in support while Connery is strong as Jim Malone, the Irish (!) beat cop who becomes Ness's mentor. I'm not sure the Oscar was totally deserved but it's still a good performance.",,Anonymous,Crime
I do recommend this very well done movie.,"On the whole I must say I loved this movie. The performances by Kevin Costner, Andy Garcia, and Charles Martin Smith were wonderful and of course there was Sean Connery who was at his inimitable best in this film. Another chilling performance by the incredibly handsome and almost deliciously evil looking Billy Drago also stands out among so many strong performances. Of course Robert De Niro was superb as Capone as well.The cinematography was wonderful as was the direction and all the production values were of high quality except for that monotonous, repetitive sound track behind the opening credits and on the DVD before you can choose which options you want to select. That seemingly never ending budda boom, budda boom, budda boom, budda boom, set my teeth on edge and had I had the misfortune to have experienced it in a theatre I might have been tempted to get up and leave the theatre for fear that that irritating noise was to be continued as the sound track throughout the film. Fortunately I have it on DVD and can skip to Scene 2 or hit the Mute button instead of tearing my hair out.I absolutely recommend buying and watching this movie on DVD, just skip over the opening credits or hit the Mute button in compassionate consideration of your teeth and your hairline.""Here endeth the lesson.""",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A gangster film from the point of view of the law,"The Untouchables is based on a real life crew of lawmen, who fought to put Al Capone behind bars, named for their incorruptibility. Lead by agent Eliot Ness, they arranged raids on known breweries and hidden ale houses, confiscated vast amounts of illegal liquor and tried to pin it all on Capone.The actual story is of course much more complicated than would be practical for a film, but overall this movie is a rather faithful representation of the events that took place and keeps at least with the spirit of what actually happened. Certain characters have been combined to make for a smoother story telling experience. But, nevertheless, it stands on its own as a very interesting and intriguing gangster story, with plenty of atmosphere, Chicago style mood, gunfights, men in fedoras, all that good stuff. It's also very interesting to see the Prohibition Era from the point of view of the law, as the time is often thought to be the golden age of gangsters and thus they're usually the focus of any story.It's also a very professionally made film. Director Bryan De Palma is also known for movies such as Scarface and Mission: Impossible, and this movie showcases his strong points equally as well, from pacing to cinematography to characters. The movie also benefits from the talents of Kevin Costner and Sean Connery as the two main law enforcers. Probably one of my favourite Costner roles, and a good showing from Connery as well. Robert De Niro as Capone leaves me a bit cold. He certainly has the charisma and the presence to pull it off, but unfortunately the movie doesn't focus on him all that much, limiting his influence.Special mention should also be made of the score by Ennio Morricone. Some great tunes here.All in all, The Untouchables is a very good Prohibition Era film. It has all the hallmarks of a classic gangster film, knows how to tell its story and has some real acting talent to pull it off. Certainly worth a watch for all fans of the era and the style.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brilliant look at one of history's great gangsters,"In de Palma's ""the Untouchables,"" we are given a very interesting look at the life of Al Capone, as portrayed by Robert De Niro. With that name on the Marquee, you know that this movie has something to sell it. De Niro's Capone is an incomplete character, appearing in the movie for only a short time, but in that time, he embodies the murderous gangster in his usual, pre-New Millennium way. Co-starring as Capone's enemies, Costner is quite compelling (if a little too heroic), Andy Garcia is brave and willing, and Costner delivers an absolutely amazing performance (he does deserve it, even if he deserved one for something else). the story is fine, and the action is incredible.

"Fun, If Not Slightly Offensive, Escapism.","I once heard a story about Stanley Kubrick's reaction to Stephen Spielberg's Holocaust film Schindler's List, where he expressed his disappointment in the film and when asked why, he said that he found that the film missed the point of the Holocaust. That the Holocaust wasn't about success, it was about failure. Now I have no idea if this story is in any way true, and Spielberg has even disputed this narrative, but it's one that I come back to when it comes to films that I find profoundly miss a point.I wasn't expecting a factual analysis of Prohibition, hardly so. The original show that it was based on was based on the tall tales of a huckster who, despite popular belief, didn't take down Al Capone. In fact, he was viewed as little more than a nuisance by old Scarface and would later botch his whole career in not catching the Cleveland Torso Murderer. I did expect to see a solid crime film, with a collective talent of gifted people. Yet this wasn't a film that was darkly intense or morally ambiguous, it was romantic and moralistic, relying too much on simplistic morality and psychology, emotional appeals, and over the top histrionics to get its point across, rather than anything that might be compelling or interesting.De Palma is a director who I really want to like, yet I always seem to catch him at his most self indulgent. Scarface, while hailed as a crime classic, is a rather ridiculous film, with a half baked message at its core about the American Dream that gets lost with a memorable, if not utterly silly performance from Al Pacino and a manic, intensely wild ride from beginning to end. But luckily this film isn't quite as manic, though it does have its silly moments, no doubt about it.The film feels gelded, like it's not reaching its full potential. It's too...Hollywood, and safe for me to sit back and truly enjoy. It feels like such colossal talents like Mamet, Morricone, and others are holding back and not pushing boundaries as they have been proven to be able to do in the past. While the script is ripe with Mamet's trademark dialogue, I found the actual story to be simplistic and overtly idealistic, psychologically undemanding and unstimulating. I was constantly frustrated by the romanticism that was in this film, the constant naive heroism that reeks throughout this film and the complete lack of awareness for the lessons that should have been learned from the Prohibition. Yet it's a generic cops n' robbers flick, though without the flair of such greats as Heat or The Dark Knight.However, this film wasn't 'bad' by any means. The acting is consistently strong. De Niro's Capone is easily the best part of this movie. For playing someone as notorious and larger than life like Capone, De Niro brings his A game as a charming, yet utterly vicious and psychotic. Under a lesser actor, he would've been relegated to a mustache twirling villain, but De Niro plays him just right to the point to where it's believable. I'm honestly baffled that it was Connery who won the Oscar and not De Niro, though don't get me wrong, Connery is still quite good in this movie. It is a bit funny to see him barely hiding his Scottish accent in the role as Jimmy Malone, but he brings his usual natural talent to scenes that could have been flat, Costner is also solid in the film, bringing his usual everyman personality to the film that works fine within the film's constraints.Overall, it's a rather fun, if not another cheesy film from De Palma and crew. It doesn't have the ham fisted attempts at being profound that Scarface had, though it does rival Scarface in the over the top theatrics department. I don't think it's a very compelling crime film, and is rather naive and overtly sententious in its messages, in a way that I feel to be harmful to anyone who might watch it. In the end, it's escapism at its most distasteful.With this film, I find another case like Spartacus, where a large group of talented people team up together, yet it doesn't seem to come together in any meaningful way.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Somewhat disappointing,"Here we have a movie which tells the story of Eliot Ness and his efforts to bring Al Capone to justice. Playing very fast and loose with the facts of the real Ness/Capone story this is definitely a Hollywood version of the Prohibition saga. Honestly there seems to be very little based in fact here other than that there once indeed lived men named Eliot Ness and Al Capone. So the movie isn't going to work as a history lesson. Does it work simply as a movie? Not as well as one might hope. The movie holds your attention throughout, the story is certainly compelling. But there are definitely problems littered throughout the film. You get the sense all the film's pieces never quite come together as well as they should.One of the movie's biggest problems is right at its heart. Kevin Costner's portrayal of Ness always seems a bit off. The character comes across as very bland, Costner seems to often be scared to show even a hint of emotion. He's rather boring and that's certainly not good. Meanwhile in portraying Capone we have Robert De Niro who appears to be acting in an entirely different movie than everybody else. With the film focusing mostly on Ness and his lawmen the Capone sequences often seem forced and oddly out of place. And, aside from one instance where he provides a novel use for a baseball bat, we never really see Capone's ruthless streak. In fact De Niro's Capone at times seems almost charming, likable even. Something about that doesn't seem right. Undoubtedly the best performance in the film comes from Sean Connery playing an Irish beat cop who, in the real history, never actually existed. Connery gets the lion's share of the memorable lines and certainly does well with the role.Director Brian De Palma, as is his wont, goes for the memorable visuals and the ""look at me, aren't I brilliant"" directorial touches. The famous baby on the staircase sequence? If it wasn't an homage you'd call it downright silly. Actually even as an homage it's still rather silly. And almost interminable. Unfortunately De Palma seems far too often to be more interested in filming things in a unique fashion than in making sure his story works. And sometimes the story simply isn't working. The movie is often too Hollywood for its own good. There are some things which you see up on the screen which simply aren't believable, having that ""only in the movies"" feel which takes you out of the film entirely. Most notable is when one character has perhaps the longest death sequence in film history. You can't help but find yourself saying ""shouldn't you be quite dead by now?"" Matters often aren't helped by the widely praised musical score which in actuality is at times rather intrusive and jarring. What we're left with is a movie which works in bits and pieces but which doesn't quite add up.

It features an authentic 1930's Chicago atmosphere, the styles and automobiles of that era. While perhaps the story isn't totally historical, I always found the reality amazing that this ruthless murderer was finally nailed by authorities on the comparatively trivial charge of income tax evasion.The movie is set in Prohibition Era Chicago. Crime lord Al Capone rules the city and even controls the police force, where corruption is rampant. Unlike most of his fellow law enforcement officers, Federal Agent Elliot Ness, cannot turn a blind eye to the criminal underworld and resolves to take Capone down by indicting him on income tax charges. To achieve this goal, he assembles a team consisting of a veteran cop Jim Malone, a rookie sharpshooter George Stone, and a Treasury accountant Oscar Wallace. Together this band of very disparate individuals sets out to bring Capone down.The film features a stellar cast. Kevin Costner imparts the right touch to Ness, who is originally innocent and honourable, but later finds himself involved in an increasingly dirty war. At first he is a fresh faced do gooder in a three piece suit, determined to do everything strictly by the book. As events unfold, he realizes that he must resort to a few less noble means to achieve his worthy goal.Sean Connery shines in his performance as the tough, old fashioned, Irish-American beat cop Malone, for which he fully deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. He displays humour, charm, and unfailing no nonsense wisdom in the ways of both Chicago's criminals and crooked cops. The other team members are well portrayed here by Andy Garcia as the sharpshooter Agent Stone, fresh out of the police academy, and Charles Martin Smith as the bookish accountant, Oscar Wallace. There's a cute and amusing scene in which the scholarly, bespectacled Wallace takes to horseback in a 'yee haw' fashion during one of their shootouts with the illegal alcohol dealers.Always the quintessential expert at mobster roles, Robert DeNiro is perfect as Capone. Some claim he gives too warm and fuzzy an image to this ruthless gangster. However, I believe he portrays perfectly this cocky, cold blooded killer. Even Capone's barber is terrified when he inadvertently cuts him while shaving. The tuxedo clad Capone's tears during a sad scene at the opera failed to elicit much compassion from me, instead merely inspiring a sense of outrage and disgust.Ness's family life is portrayed briefly here. We see his wife's little notes in his lunch bag, Ness at his young daughter's bedside as she says her prayers, and him visiting his new baby son in hospital. His family must of course be hustled off to safety after they are threatened by Capone's hoodlums. My only complaint is the dewy eyed, unrealistically innocent and naive wife. Her cheerful nonchalance strains credulity, as in reality one would predict her to be distraught with concern over her husband's safety.This cops and robbers thriller is engrossing but also troubling with so much violence. There are certainly gripping action sequences and shoot outs, especially the masterful train station scene. Personally, I would check with reliable sources before taking any of it as historical fact. However, the movie brilliantly captures the touching bond that develops between these four highly motivated and personally endangered Untouchables.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

What Could Have Been Untouchable,"The story tells a really cool tail from a really cool time, that just never seizes to reach its apex. Sean Connery was tremendous, Costner was well suited for his role as well. The Untouchables is a really good cast, but to me the line and whole disappointment of the film is you have the opportunity of DeNiro as Al Capone and he's almost an afterthought and made to look aloof and stupid at times. I would have liked the film to be 25 minutes longer with 20 minutes of time showing Capone's iron first rule of Chicago in the 1920's and 1930's. This could have helped severely strengthen the plot, and not just assumed people knew how big Capone was in 1930's Chicago.Overall it's a good film, it receives an 8.3 from me just due to the missed opportunity of what could have been a signature performance with DeNiro as an icon in the Gangster world.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"While it is a little uneven, I do like the movie.","Some of the more dramatic scenes are slow and boring. The first act is very uneven with slow, forgettable scenes when we see Al Capone and Elliot Ness individually, but enjoyable moments from the music and opening credits plus Sean Connery giving the most consistent performance and a well deserved Oscar nomination. Neither Andy Garica or Charles Martin Smith are given much to do yet as the other two main characters. The next act, once the Untouchables are officially together, picks up much better with many exciting action scenes. Capone still feels a little underwhelming and Costner is still a flat Elliot Ness, but the other stuff is gripping.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Dire,"This film is dire, like Disney made a gangster movie - none of it is remotely believable, it's just dross.Clearly a talented cast, but they all, without exception, put in such poor performances - so presumably it's the director who's at fault here.In summary, it has no redeeming features. Dialogue sections are wooden (Connery is so, so bad), death scenes ludicrously overacted and elongated, there's no menace about the villains whatsoever, none of the characters are really believable or come across as authentic, etc, etc.I've no idea why so many people have scored this so highly on here- if the cast weren't big names then this would have been straight-to-video.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

Geeky Randy's summary,"Eliot Ness (Costner) sets out to take down Al Capone (De Niro), with some of Capone's mobsters verses Ness's hand-picked team The Untouchables (Smith, Garcia and Connery). Historically inaccurate. Costner's voice is emotionless as usual, while Connery's is like he's still playing James Bond; both of their voices are annoying and distracting. De Palma's ""dazzling"" direction, ceiling shots for example, are unnecessary; as if De Palma is more concerned about impressing the Academy than telling the story. Smith and Garcia do their job, but nothing fancy. De Niro delivers a surprising unmemorable performance as the notorious Capone. The film itself is overly-theatrical for what it is, what it needs to be and what it should be. But despite all these flaws, none of them are fatal. Fast-paced from beginning to end, every moment enjoyable. From the first line of ""why, since it would seem that you are in effect the Mayor of Chicago, you're not simply being appointed to that position,"" to the final line of ""I think I'll have a drink"", it's a remarkable and unforgettable film with several great scenes.

A simple story masterfully done,"The Untouchables is one of Brian de Palmas crowning achievements, and deservedly so. It is a film which combines many elements of his trademark style to create a truly engrossing, marvellous picture where all elements are in perfect balance and in wonderful synergy with each other.Much of this films success has to do with its screenplay. David Mamets screenplay has a distinct warmth to it about the camaraderie and kinship of men. But it also has a magnificence, a grandeur to it which keeps audiences entertained. Consider the mid movie shoot out involving truckload of booze, and the magnificent, triumphant mood in that scene. Mamets screenplay is also very lean, easily making for an absorbing, involving watch where there is no pressure to glance at a watch or a clock. It is sharp, propulsive, and as a general rule, avoids sentimentality. Sentimentality is only used to act as realistic character motivations in this film, and is perfectly measured, never overdone.De Palmas excellent direction also deserves credit. The film features many of his trademark style, which adds visual splendour to our screens. For instance, De Palma uses many high angle shots in this film, which spices up the visuals. They are always used appropriately and elegantly, whether to convey scale, atmosphere, or the moods of characters. De Palma also uses many point of view shots, the most notable of which is an extended sequence where the camera follows an assassin going into Malones house. As a result, The Untouchables feels slightly Hitchcockian- there is a great deal of thrills and suspense for the audience to relish in.The last triumph in this film is its uniformly superb acting among all of its cast members, Kevin Costner turns in a superb performance as Ness. Ness feels very much like Damian Lewis' Lieutenant Winters in Band Of Brothers- both are men with immense fortitude and bravery in surmounting the insurmountable. But there is another dimension to Ness- that he may be rash and emotional. He is not a consummate professional, rather he is a man who will mercilessly kill those who have hurt his friends. He is very human, and this makes him relatable to the audience. Sean Connery is also outstanding in the film. He portrays a man with great self assuredness, and a wealth of practical wisdom and intelligence. He is a very likeable and endearing character, and I must applaud that this film had the courage to go in the direction that it did with Connery's Character. Lastly, is soul like to comment on De Niros Al Capone, which is simply fantastic, he has the ego, the evil glint in his eye, and the brash Italian English which makes for such an entertaining villain.Truthfully, The Untouchablss came as a surprise to me as the film is, on closer examination, really a very simple, by the books tale. Many of its plot points are at least slightly predictable(save for one major plot event which I would not spoil), and the film might not distinguish itself based on the general direction of its story alone. But it surprised me because of how brilliantly executed it was. It truly distinguishes itself in how it tells its story- through an interesting, slick lens, with warm, endearing, and well acted characters, and with first-rate writing which is able to keep audiences fully immersed. The Untouchables is proof that sometimes, Hollywood screenwriters need not rack their brains for inventive plots, for a film can elevate itself through inventive execution. The Untouchables is a simple story masterfully done.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Interesting Exploration of Violence,"This is a tense little historical action piece dramatising the gaiden where the IRS nabbed Al Capone. Except that it seems to take the violence up a good notch and has the treasury police having to use a good deal of firepower in addition to their accounting skills to finally put Capone away.That and the budget and attempt to grab mainstream appeal should make it not at all surprising that it's got its flaws. Namely, it frequently descends into typical chase and shootout scenes for nothing other than the sheer joy of yanking the audience around. Certainly, as the poster attempts to telegraph to its audience from the beginning, this is an action movie at heart. No one will complain that this movie attempts to meticulously analyse the US tax code and its application to organised crime.Yet as dumb as some of the action scenes are, the movie is great food for thought if you stop and think of the historical context in which it takes place and which is frequently hinted at by the movie. This is the era of Prohibition, where a drug the majority of the people indulged in and society at large felt was benign was prohibited. While the whole affair probably didn't unfold as this movie tells it, I don't think anyone will doubt that it was a brutal war on drugs involving a hearty portion of grenades and tommy guns.And all for what? As the movie's tongue-in-cheek ending reminds us after all the exhausting mindless shootouts, it was all pointless, pointless. It was a drug war that no one wanted against a drug that everyone wanted and it left a lot of senseless deaths in its wake.Amidst rising drug cartel violence all over the world, this movie, just like the great experiment of Prohibition itself, leave a lot to ponder with regard to society's penchant for banning of substances and the ugly violence that results from that.Honourable Mentions: El Infierno (2010). The curtain eventually falls in Prohibition and, although it was pointless, there's something of a relieving ending in The Untouchables - one less thing to worry about tomorrow. Not so in El Infierno, that represents the drug war as an endless cycle of violence.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Generic, Bland and Cheesy.","""The Untouchables"" (1987) claims to be an iconic crime drama, but it falls embarrassingly short in almost every aspect. From its generic plot to its outdated direction style, this film fails to leave a lasting impression and instead becomes a forgettable and cheesy experience.One of the most glaring issues with ""The Untouchables"" is its incredibly predictable and generic storyline. We are presented with the classic ""good versus evil"" scenario, with a group of honest law enforcers trying to take down a notorious gangster. Unfortunately, the plot lacks any nuance or surprises, making it feel like a by-the-numbers crime drama we have seen countless times before.To exacerbate matters, the direction style employed by Brian De Palma feels painfully outdated. The excessive use of slow-motion shots, dramatic close-ups, and dramatic zooms only serves to remind viewers that they are watching a film firmly stuck in the past. This approach may have once been innovative, but it now feels like a tired cliché, unable to bring any fresh energy or excitement to the screen.Adding insult to injury, the acting in ""The Untouchables"" is nothing short of cheesy. With over-the-top performances and exaggerated accents, the actors seem like they're trying too hard to be taken seriously. Instead of delivering authentic and emotionally resonant portrayals, they come across as caricatures, further contributing to the film's overall lack of depth and substance.The music, touted as one of the film's highlights, only serves to reinforce the pervasive feeling of blandness. The score fails to evoke any genuine emotion, with its generic orchestral motifs lacking the power to engross or captivate the audience. Coupled with the uninspired writing and lackluster dialogue, it ultimately adds to the film's overall dullness.""The Untouchables"" is an undeniable disappointment, failing to leave a lasting impression due to its generic storyline, outdated direction style, cheesy acting, and uninspired music. It falls flat in every department, offering nothing new or memorable. For those seeking a truly engaging crime drama, it's best to look elsewhere.",1.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Great cast, great directing, great score, great movie!","Brian De Palma is a great director and this is one of his best movies. The Untouchables has everything a good gangster movie should have. This starts with a great cast: Kevin Costner is good as Elliot Ness, but surprisingly, the rest of the cast is even better. Connery is excellent, as always, and DeNiro is very convincing a Al Capone. Andy Garcia, an actor which hasn't played in a good movie for a while is perfect for his ""tough new cop"" role. But two of the best actors in the movie, right behind Connery, are actors I had never heard of: Billy Drago, which is absolutely perfect as Frank Nitti, giving him a cold, and Charles Martin Smith is well cast as Oscar Wallace. Ennio Morricone's score is incredible... And David Mamet's script is very good. But what steals the show is certainly Brian De Palma's directing and Stephen H. Burum's cinematography. This movie is full of suspense, great action scenes and an involving story which never loses steam. This is a very entertaining and well-done movie.84%",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A very good film, but should have been so much more","As a gangster film, The Untouchables is among the likes of Goodfellas and The Departed, however as a film about the hunt by Eliot Ness for Al Capone, it should have been so much more.Don't get me wrong it's a very good film, the performance by Andy Garcia as Giuseppe Petri was brilliant (he was my favourite character in the entire film and Robert De Niro as notorious gangster Al Capone is one of his best performances I have seen, it's up there with James Conway from Goodfellas. However, not all the performances hit home. Kevin Costner's portrayal of Eliot Ness was anything but spectacular, which is a great shame as Kevin Costner is a very good actor. Also Sean Connery's portrayal of Jim Malone is by no means bad, it's just that his character is Irish and, yeah, whatever that accent was, it wasn't Irish.What the film does really well though is how it is shot. The sweeping shots of Chicago look magnificent. However, on a technical standpoint nothing else really impresses like it should. There is one scene in particular where they use slow mo. The reason I bring this up is that it is one thing to use slow mo but it is another to over use it, especially as it is only this one scene that uses it, it does really take you out of what is meant to be a pinnacle moment of the film and it never really brings you out of that area and gets you immersed in the film again. The music can also be distracting, for the most part it's okay, it does its job but when an important part of the film rears its head, it goes all operatic which really doesn't fit the tone or the setting of the movie, which again slightly draws you out of the movie.In conclusion, The Untouchables is one of the best gangster movies I have ever seen, however, for what it is and how much of a defining moment the plan to bring down Al Capone was in history, it just wasn't enough and for what I was expecting, I was a little let down. I just hope Scarface is better.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Top notch cast,"(1987) The Untouchables
CRIME DRAMA/ ACTIONSomewhat of a fictionalize account of a real life and powerful gangster and how Elliot Ness and company brought him down! I love seeing the comrade and the odds with which corruption used to exist back on the old days. Seeing this film for a second time made me realize why this film was more superior than some other Capone films made in the past especially the ones that were black/ white! Since back on those days the amount of violence on film was limited and weren't permitted to be shown even though Capone was more ruthless and more dangerous than what people saw him in films (such as DeNiro as Capone using a baseball bat on an unsuspecting individual). When people went to see Capone on film, people expect to see what people read about on news papers and on books and the amount of violence allowed on films was limited! The movie is accurate that Capone was finally arrested for tax evasion and is inaccurate because of the shoot outs but it is only just a movie and should only be looked at just for just that.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hollywood-ised story of Al Capone's takedown,"The Untouchables is a very, very fictionalised version of Al Capone's takedown that leans quite heavily on the Hollywood tropes. While its action scenes are riveting and its bloody stakes are high, it ultimately succumbs to some heavyhanded storytelling techniques that lay its artifice bare. The main characters seem to slot too neatly into flawed-yet-lovable archetypes, the story beats are arranged too neatly into an arc for the protagonist and the family relations are too sensationalist to take seriously, especially a certain cheesy scene with a baby near the end.

A Great Story,"Brian DePalma's ""The Untouchables"" is a blast from beginning to end, and there is nothing not to like about this movie's unique quality. It tells the story of Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner), a federal agent who vows to take down the notorious Al Capone (Robert De Niro). Capone is ruling Chicago's Prohibition-era streets. Violence along with bootlegging is everywhere. Ness is a firm believer in following the law, whether or not he agrees with it. Because of this dedication, and of all the lives taken by Capone, Ness decides to be the first officer to take action and bring the fight to Capone's doorstep. Yet, failed raids and harassment from the media lead him to make another decision; he needs help. Some nights later he meets Irish cop Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery). Malone is an aging, yet very smart police officer who finds himself dedicated to stopping Capone, and help Ness is his mission. ""You want to get Capone, here's how you do it: if his man pulls a knife, you pull a gun. If he sends you to the hospital, send one of his to the the morgue. That's the Chicago way."" This being one of Malone's lessons to Ness; it's a rough neighborhood, and you'll have to be rough to stop it. Ness, with his teacher and partner, decide to search out other possibilities. George Stone (Andy Garcia) is an Italian who has changed his name in an attempt to avoid connections with the mafia. He has chosen the right side of the law, and he wants others to know it. He is an excellent shot and both Malone and Ness like him. The last member is Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), an accountant for the FBI, who discovers he can be tougher than anyone ever thought. This is the story of a group of four men, the first of who decide to stand up to the crime wave lead by Al Capone. A great story it is.Much of the films events are based on the real life experiences of an actual group, nicknamed ""The Untouchables,"" who did bring the fight to Capone's doorstep. While many of the events are actual, there is still plenty of the film that was imagined. I will warn you that this film is probably not an accurate representation of the criminal underworld, but can be stylized in its storytelling. Is there anything wrong with that? Absolutely not. It's a new way of looking at a dark part of this country's history, and it makes for a very interesting perspective. Everything about the story is a blast. Written by David Mamet, the screenplay lets us look into the past in a very romantic way. The only reason this film is romantic, beautifully shot, and executed is because of Brian DePalma. He directed this film to greatness, and made this movie worth every penny; whether you are renting or buying this picture, and feel satisfied at the end, it is due to DePalma. Hats off to him.Extraordinary acting leads this old-fashioned movie to even greater heights. Kevin Costner, in a role where he was first unknown, pulls his job off in every way. He is likable and charismatic. We do know, however, that when his life and family is threatened, his methods can become intense. A very well-rounded performance from Costner. Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace is a great performance. He is not only funny, but just a great overall acting addition to this group. Andy Garcia, pulling off a career-making performance, lets us know why he should never be underestimated. Sean Connery is great here, scene-by-scene he knocks us off of our feet. This great performance garnered him a well-earned Best Supporting Actor Academy Award. Robert De Niro. We can't say enough about him. Ever. He pulls off one of the best performances of the movie as Al Capone. Not only will his bodily features remind you of Capone, but so will his behavior. There is one point where he smiles just like Capone used to do, and there is a scary similarity. A great, great job from De Niro. You shouldn't be surprised by that.In the end, everything works. The old-fashioned allure. The great directing. The great script. The great acting. All of these elements make this film a classic. A film that will go down in history, and is every bit worthy of doing so.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Add to that, Kevin Costner's breakthrough performance, as Elliott Ness, and incredible Chicago sets, and you have a brilliant, although inaccurate, re-telling of the Fed's bringing down Al Capone. Notable scenes include the formal dinner with a baseball bat; Ness and Malone on one of the bridges over the Chicago River; Ness's confrontation with Capone at the hotel; and the scene at Chicago's Union Station, which I am sure they analyze in film school today.

This movie needs and deserves more respect,"It's sad that such a great movie is ranked near the end of the IMDb Top 250 list and struggles to stay in it (not that IMDb Top 250 makes sense anyway) . I don't think people realize what a small piece of art this movie is and treat it as mere entertainment . Also, when talking about the best 80's movies people often forget about this pearl . Life's unfair.""The Untouchables "" is a gangster movie , yet you shouldn't compare it to ""Godfather"" , ""Godfather 2"" , ""Once upon a time in America"" or ""Goodfellas"". The reason is simple – it's a different kind of a movie despite it has gangsters in it. The movies I've mentioned more or before more or less tell the same story of hero raising to the top of the criminal world and then falling into hell . ""The Untouchables"" is more of a  western . It's a story about group of people that couldn't stand the injustice in their city anymore and decided to fight with it by all means necessary. Yes , it's very entertaining , but it has a lot of heart and substance too.As one of the heroes says everybody knows where evil hides , it's just nobody wants to do anything about it ( out of fear , apathy or corruption) . To fight evil you have to be even more ruthless than the criminals . You have to sometimes do illegal methods (torture , blackmail). You have to get dirty if you want to keep the streets clean . You have to be brave , because it might cost you family or life . That's the whole movie is about . It's all in the story of Elliott Ness . When we first meet him his a honest and idealistic , yet unexperienced and soft rookie when it comes to fighting crime . Through the movie he will become tough , charismatic and confident crime fighter.I don't agree with opinion that characters are one dimensional . Ness (Kevin Costner) as I've mentioned earlier changes through the movie . Malone (Sean Connery) is a true mentor for our heroes . He's bitter and lonely old man when we meet him . Later , he will become a father figure for the rest of group . He's wise , strong willed , cynical and determined . Stone (Andy Garcia) is a young rebel with a softer side. Oscar (Charles Martin Smith ) works as a good comic relief , yet people forget he's also intelligent and brave. Al Capone ( Robert de Niro) deep down is nothing , but a simple primitive street thug , yet he hides it under his gentleman behavior.Sean Connery quite probably gives the best performance of his career . The Oscar was deserved . I'm not a fan of Kevin Costner , yet he fits the role of Ness PERFECTLY . Along with ""Silverado "" it's his best performance . He's character could be very boring since he is so noble and all , but Costner makes him a true human being you can care for. Robert de Niro has a rather small screen time and many complained about that . Still , he plays Capone with obvious irony and that makes his character memorable.Let's not forget about Billy Drago (Frank Vitti) , Richard Bradford (Mike) , Jack Kehoe (Payne ) and Patricia Clarkson ( Ness wife) . They all give solid support to the main stars of the movie .The music by Ennio Morricone is BEAUTIFUL .""Four friends "" , ""The Death theme"" , "" Al Capone's theme "" , "" The Strength of the righteous "" and ""The Untouchables"" . Beautiful tracks . I need to get the soundtrack . Along with Basil Poleudoris music for ""Robocop"" this was the best soundtrack in 1987 . The art direction-set decoration and costumes are wonderful. The movie looks very elegant and takes you right into the prohibition era.David Mamet created a screenplay with incredibly stylish and memorable dialogues . Along the way there are also some surprising twists and good character development . Brian de Palma has outdone himself with the direction . He gives the audience brilliant shootout scene (obviously inspired by ""Pancernik Potiomkin"") , great chase scene and assassination scene . I loved the first person perspective in one important scene and the various camera angles through the movie . It's also worth noticing that ""The Untouchables"" is one of few movies that shows how violence hurts and affects lives of the characters , just like in real life it would. I cry during this movie about 4 times , but I'm not gonna spoil the movie .Awesome . I give it 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

A contrived but engrossing spectacle,"Under the guidance of Brian De Palma, who entered this project on the back of two consecutive flops in Body Double and Wise Guys, the story of how Al Capone was brought down in Prohibition Era Chicago has become a contrived spectacle - a production so big and polished that every scene is only a hairsbreadth away from drying up completely. Despite this, The Untouchables is an engrossing film with tension and nerve, largely thanks to David Mamet's often crisp writing and Sean Connery's brilliant performance, which is what brings a human touch to this film. Less human is Robert De Niro's caricatured Al Capone, who's never given anything other than mastodontic scenes to work with by De Palma. And a ""mastodon"" he becomes. The film is famous for the iconic scene at Union Station, in which De Palma displays his set-piece skills to the delight of movie buffs all around.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Filled with improbabilities,"Capone and Ness about to duke it out on the stairs of a hotel. Capone's and Ness's people hold them back. Nobody would defy Capone that way. A cop gets shot in a place where there are plenty of cops and Ness goes after him to battle with him on the roof, with no cops following after him. The court house would have been full of cops. He goes to the train station to confront the bad guys, also no cops around. Capone punching his attorney in the court house and then going after the judge. I doubt that happened. This thing is so obviously fabricated. Talk about Hollywood fluff. First of all, Sean Connery contrary to what most people think, is in my opinion a lousy actor. So, is Kevin Costner. Andy Garcia is totally not awake. Brian De Palma should stick to thrillers of a more superficial variety and stay away from historical drama.

"If you're afraid of getting a rotten apple, don't go to the barrel. Get it off the tree.","1930 Chicago. Prohibition is the law of the land, but Chicago is ruled by mobsters who control the alcohol bootlegging, and the infamous Al Capone sits at the top of the
heap. Anyone who has tried to go after him
has wound up dead, so no one tries anymore. Capone's organization has their hand in everything happening in the city. They extort money from most every business, and they have all the right people bought and paid for.Chicago supposedly has a mayor running the city,, but everyone knows that Capone is the King of the town.Enter treasury agent Elliot Ness (Costner), who's been sent to Chicago to take Capone's business ""down."" (Of course, they have to say they tried, right?)At first, Ness tries to work with the whole Chicago PD, but quickly realizes how much
influence Capone has over the police dept. So he finds a veteran Chicago cop (through a random, chance encounter) named Malone (Connery) who informs Ness that no one in Chicago wants him there. That he can trust no one. That if he really wants to take Capone down he's going to have to be willing to do whatever it takes. They recruit two more, trustworthy men, to help them in their hunt, and the 4 of them become what are now called the Untouchables. Will they succeed in taking Capone's operation down?What can I possibly say about this movie that hasn't already been said? Can't believe it came out 35 yrs ago!!

A Muddled film relying on 80s style over lack-lustre content,"A fairly humdrum retelling of the Chicago gangster wars of the 20s & 30s and in particular Elliot Ness' long term battle bringing top gangster Al Capone to book on a range of  charges from murder, prohibition & bootlegging to his eventual downfall of simple tax evasion.De Palma does a pretty bad hash with this movie. Firstly, he is hard pushed into thinking of any original cinematography he can genuinely call his own. The most blatant rip off is the ""Odessa Steps"" scene at the train station which was originally done so masterfully decades ago in the Russian film Battleship Potyomkin (1925).And I doubt if the real Ness swaned around in designer clothes back in the 20s either. But then again this is the yuppy 80s we're talking about when this film was made, so I suppose it wasn't cool to be wearing anything less than a Label.Then we have  the actors. Connery really does amaze me sometimes. He plays Malone a bit like Office Dibble out of Top Cat, unsure of what accent to use and always coming out with words of wisdom but never really convincing us with any true conviction. Although his death scene was quite moving otherwise he was as wooden as a beer keg.Costner again excels as a man with a total charisma bypass. He sparkles from time to time but generally he just plods through the story in his customary dot to dot style.The only shining light would be De Nero as the Big C himself. Totally convincing, totally ruthless, played just right - never drifting into characature, never falling into cliche, De Nero is excellent. And of course who can forget his little baseball story around the dinner table!The only criticism with De Nero is that we don't get to see enough of him; we don't get the chance to absorb his character or understand his evil mannerisms. De Palma offers simple sign posting telling the audience that this guy is all bad and that's all you need to know.The supporting cast give a good account of themselves, especially Garcia & Martin-Smith.The production values are obviously high & lavish but all this eye candy & stylish camera work doesn't make for a good film with an underworked script. De Palma is too heavy handed with his character development with regards the good guys - hense the heavy emphasis on Ness being a good family man, doting wife, child & baby on the way. All done in about 10 minutes.The same with Connery, simple explanations so that we can feel for this old time cop and then the scene is set to do battle with the invincible foe, who we don't get to know much about.The musical score is very upbeat & concise which is perhaps the only good thing about the movie; that and some decent lighting & 2nd unit camera work.Overall, a film full of other people's ideas packaged with 80's designerism & style over content but with nothing new to offer. **/*****",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Solid Movie,"I remember I first saw this movie in a history class in high school because we were learning about the prohibition, and I think it's a film that really sells the struggle between the police and the criminals during the prohibition, specifically the famous Al Capone.

He shines in any scenes where emotions are high and everything becomes serious. Robert De Niro plays Al Capone, and I kind of wish they showed more of him, because I enjoyed watching him, especially in the end courtroom scene. It just felt like he was giving a good performance that couldn't be 100% enjoyed because he wasn't present enough.The film includes quite a few classic scenes and quotes that are extremely memorable.

Le Meh...,"The Untouchables is a compelling account of the dismantling of the Al Capone gangster empire. This movie offers an experienced and exciting cast of classic actors. Sean Connery should be noted for his fantastic performance in particular. If this movie came out in 1970, as the directing style might suggest, it would have been a true classic. The story of Al Capone is an interesting and exciting tale rooted in the history of prohibition. Despite this, The Untouchables still leaves something to be desired. The story is not terribly complex and mirrors that of a video game, and Kevin Costner's performance keeps reminding me of Keanu Reeves in Speed or Speed 2: Cruise Control. Plus the action scenes are a little cheesy for 1987. For instance, there were a lot of ""oohs"" and ""owes"" from the actors as they're characters were being pumped full bullets. When I first heard about this movie, people had told me it was goo, and I was intrigued about the man who amassed and controlled the Chicago crime syndicate- Al Capone. But I found The Untouchables disappointing in this respect. Even though Robert DeNero does the job you'd expect him to do, but his character remains terribly underdeveloped. Al Capone is presented simply as a typical big, mean bad guy. His character is written simply to justify Kevin Costner's character shooting at him and his cronies periodically throughout the film. It feels a lot like a western: there are clearly distinguishable good guys and bad guys, lots of gunfights with lame stunts, and unrealistic dialog. It's basically a 1960's version of The Magnificent Seven that came out in the late 80's. It's dangerous to label any movie a ""gangster movie"" especially if they've been out since the Godfather. After watching this movie, you would never expect that Goodfellas came out just three years later, and Reservoir Dogs just five years later. Honestly, if you consider yourself a film buff, ad this movie to your resume' just to say you've seen it. Young kids might have liked it, if it weren't so ridiculously violent for such a simple film. But if you're looking for anything more than a good old-fashioned ""new sheriff in town beats up the bad guys"" movie, look elsewhere.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"The great Sean Connery was born on August 25th, 1930","The year 1987 was a highly competitive and productively, busy year in the motion picture industry. You should see all the titles, that came out that year. It is an incredible list of films. This one is at the top of that list. This biopic, crime-drama is the story of Al Capone (Robert DeNiro) and Elliot Ness (Kevin Cosner), as they wage their Prohibition war against each other, in 1920s Chicago. Ness needs help competing with the corrupt police force, at his disposal, so he gets help from a semi-retired, Irish, beat cop, named Malone (Sean Connery). They form a team (with Andy Garcia as George Stone and Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace), name themselves the Untouchables and learn, that not only do they have to fight Al Capone, but they also have to fight the politically, corrupted, Hell-hole, known as Prohibition Chicago. We are transported back to the 1920s.It is a fascinating film to see in the 21st century. The controversial idea of Prohibition, attitudes towards alcohol and different ideas, involving the role of law enforcement, are much different in the 21st century. This film offers a cinematic recreation of a period in our history, from 100 years ago, albeit with the Hollywood punch. Things are so different in our world today, that while you watch this film unfold, these 100 year old ideas, create an interesting, blurring of the lines, between good and bad. It creates a new dimension to this film. It allows you to look at it from many different angles. The Untouchables (1987), may well be one of the greatest gangster movies ever made. It is definitely one of De Palma's best. Director Brian DePalma weaves a great story around a time in our history, that has become more like folklore, than history, from a 21st century standpoint.The cinematography, editing, pacing, intensity, along with the riveting soundtrack by legendary film composer, Ennio Morricone, make this a heart pounding, action thriller, with a little taste of history thrown in too. Robert DeNiro makes you speechless, with his performance. Sean Connery is his normal greatness in this film. When this film was released in 1987, I got the pleasure of seeing it in the theaters, during its original release. After I saw the film, for weeks and weeks, all I read about or heard about, was how much everyone loved Sean Connery in this film. He deserves the credit too, because he would go on and win the Oscar for Best Actor in a Supporting Role, the following year, at the Academy Awards. This film also made Kevin Cosner's star soar from this point. He was already on the rise, but after this film, he became a major Hollywood hero, because of his portrayal of Elliot Ness.The Untouchables (1987), places you right into Prohibition-era Chicago. It rolls out the plot with a high amount of energy and gives you a cast, that does not insult you, with actors, just doing their jobs. The cast puts everything they have into it. DeNiro will not disappoint those, who haven't seen the film yet. This film is a brilliant piece of work, which Brian DePalma has done many times before. You are transported to a place, time and history, that happened a century ago. It puts you at the crime scene, completely with action-packed moments, dramatic character development and the serious intensity of blood-soaked violence. You love the good guys and you love to hate the bad-guys, is the ultimate reward when watching a piece of work like this. Whenever anyone mentions this film in conversation, the first thing I think of is Ennio Morricone pulse-pounding soundtrack. This film is excellent.9.4 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

The reason why Public Enemies shouldn't be made.,"Clearly, because this movie existed, Public Enemies should never have been made. With very believable depiction, legendary film-making and performances, The Untouchables gave you the best crime epic about 1930s.One of the best efforts pulled off by the movie, as mentioned, lies within its believability. The depictions of either Ness or Capone could have been totally cartoonish or on the other extreme, being like robots. However, Kevin Costner and Robert De Niro were so good in their characters that Johnny Depp and Christian Bale should have taken notes. Ness was never an ""action hero"" or someone really so ""untouchable"" in the movie. On the contrast, he is weak, regularly depressed and could fail at all. As the core character of the story, he is legendary not only in his achievement in taking down Capone, but also in his character's development from a dedicated white knight to a somewhat bad-ass crime fighter. Costner's performance totally made Ness more convincing and emotional, charged by Brian De Palma's best casting ever. The movie is convincing also because it's multi-dimensional, that a 20-year-old and a 40-year-old will both enjoy but got different things from it. The storyline flowed so naturally and realistically that as an audience one felt the pain, the fear and the price of fighting crime and criminals. Yes, this is a movie where the heroes can get hurt, killed, but still they pulled off a legendary fight with the most vicious criminal. Unlike Public Enemies' self-indulgent storyline, The Untouchables is a lesson about character study in a streamlined story-telling. The reason Sean Connery deserved his Oscar is also justified here.The visuals, along with other aspects of the movie, are nearly perfected by director De Palma. The gunfights may not be so stylish and kinetic as in recent films like Public Enemies, but definitely had their edge. Essentially, the movie never put too much weight on actions, yet the actions stood out to entertain. Sometimes, old school is good school.If you notice, The Untouchables already had everything that Public Enemies wanted to talk about, and in a better way and shorter time. It's full of mesmerizing camera works and likable characters, yet stayed true to the nature of reality, no doubt it's only getting better and better after all these years.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Not historically accurate, but still an alright movie","A glossy look at the peak of the Chicago mafia era.The number of A-listers appearing is surprising. Started this movie not knowing what to expect and loved seeing so many well-known faces. Though, seeing Andy Garcia act did make me want to hurl. The acting was cheesy in some parts. Take, for example, Sean Connery's horrendous ""Irish"" accent or breathing ""dead"" people.Attire and set design in this movie were visual eye-candy. Giorgio Armani did a nifty job making sure everyone's suit were a sign of the times and roles. Chicago was visually stunning and the movie portrayed the classical Windy City well.The action scenes pepper the movie well and leaves enough to not bore.For all its pluses, two things bothered me about this movie.For starters, the cheesy musical score was distracting and felt ripped from a cheap 90s film. Nothing in the musical score was memorable or added much to the movie. I found myself more annoyed by the music than anything. Punches and gunshots sounded off and didn't match what was on screen. Out of all the money spent on this movie, more should've been spent on sound design.Second, historical inaccuracies were glaring. The operation itself was a lot less flashy than what the movie makes it out to be. A lot fewer people died than what was in the movie. But this can be forgiven, Hollywood has to sell a story somehow.For all that it gives and takes, this movie was a tough one to rate. I'll have to settle on a 3/5. Average at best. The movie aims too high above the bar and misses its mark.Though critically received at the time, this movie felt a bit too cheesy and cliche for my tastes. Scenes were predictable, music was horrendous, and Sean Connery's accent was damnable.I'd recommend this to those interested in Prohibition-era Chicago culture... but not for those with an eye for historical accuracy.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Untouchables still holds up incredibly well after more than 30 years!,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Capone starring Tom Hardy is being released this week, so I decided to visit a classic from the late 80s that also features Al Capone (this time portrayed by Robert De Niro). One of my 2020's resolutions is to review older films, classics that I never wrote about, and maybe go through a director's filmography before his/her next big movie. I'll also try to review previous films inside a franchise, for example, before the live-action Mulan is released, I'll definitely rewatch and review the 1998's original. You get my point.The Untouchables is one of those classics I've already seen a few times, but I can't quite recall the last time I watched it, so it almost felt like a whole new release since I didn't remember most plot points. I really enjoyed experiencing such a great period gangster movie again. The cast is incredible, and I'll get there, but I need to start with the impressive production level for a 1987's flick. From the set design to the well-crafted action sequences, everything looks and feels like Chicago during the Prohibition Era.I love how the dialogues are played out. Nowadays, it's not that common to have an entire film filled with long, uncut conversations between the characters. Most directors just employ the unimaginative ""line-cut-line"" type of dialogue. I'm not the biggest fan of Brian DePalma, even though he started one of my favorite action sagas of all-time (Mission: Impossible). However, his blocking/framing skills are outstanding in this movie. Every actor's movement is followed seamlessly by the camera (DP: Stephen H. Burum), making every single shot count.The screenplay is very well-structured. Every time the film starts lacking energy, something impactful occurs. A great action scene, a new story development that changes the course of the narrative, or a character's decision that makes the viewer worried about an inevitable outcome. Consequently, The Untouchables rarely loses its momentum, it's always entertaining in some shape or form. The four characters that constitute the title group are all emotionally compelling, and their actors offer extraordinary performances... except for the lead, Kevin Costner.I don't know if people might consider this a hot take or not, but I find Costner's display extremely one-dimensional. During the movie, he goes through life-threatening situations, people that he cares about die, and he eventually gets face-to-face with Al Capone. His facial expression looks awkwardly almost identical in all of these scenes, and many more. It's his first big film, the one that catapulted him into stardom, but I'm not the first to find his acting rangeless in this flick. Nevertheless, it doesn't become that big of a distraction that I can't connect with his character.Regarding the rest of the cast, Sean Connery steals the show with his portrayal of Jim Malone. He's charming and funny, but when he needs to take his character through a very dark and dramatic scene, he has no problems in delivering an exceptional performance. The young Andy Garcia (George Stone) proves that he had the chops to become a great actor (which he did), and Charles Martin Smith is surprisingly witty as Oscar Wallace. My main issue with the movie involves the lack of screentime given to Robert De Niro as Al Capone.Sure, it's a story about the people who got the famous gangster, and not a biography of the latter. However, not only it's a waste of a phenomenal actor, but also a waste of a potentially great character. Al Capone is supposedly a quite clever businessman and ruthless crime boss, possessing an unusually well-protected organization, but he only appears in a few scattered scenes, like he's just some random villain that the good guys need to defeat. Granted, they're really cool scenes, but he doesn't feel like the massive threat that the film assumes he is since the viewer barely gets to know Al Capone and how he holds so much power.All in all, The Untouchables still holds up incredibly well after more than thirty years. Production-wise, not only the sets and costumes seamlessly resemble the Prohibition Era, but Brian DePalma's technically impressive blocking and framing are a joy to watch. Long, captivating, uncut dialogues are elevated by a remarkable cast (Sean Connery is undoubtedly the standout), despite Kevin Costner lacking a bit of emotional range. Even the action sequences of this 1987's movie look better than a lot of blockbusters of today. David Mamet writes a well-structured screenplay that rarely loses interest and featuring exceptionally compelling characters. Addictive score from Ennio Morricone as well. However, both Robert De Niro and his character, Al Capone, are underused, especially the latter. For such an important character who constantly changes the path of the narrative, the lack of screentime doesn't allow the viewer to understand Al Capone's motivations or feel how much of a threat he truly is. Still, it's a classic worthy of a rewatch, and I definitely recommend it.Rating: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Mildly amusing with a couple classic sequences,"Not as good as most classic mob films. Mostly just mildly amusing aside from a couple really killer action sequences towards the end. Costner's acting is wooden as an oak log. I have no idea how he was an A-list star. Garcia, Connery, and Deniro add a bit more charisma to the flick, but it's still not enough to really allow this to be a great film. Even Morricone's score feels recycled and less inspired than most of his works, but it's still nice to have his flair in there - it still adds to the movie quite a bit. What it really all comes down to though is when one guy takes about 30 bullets from a tommy gun all the way up his torso, and somehow he's still alive for what seems like a good 10-20 minutes...movie magic I guess?",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Entertainment at its finest,"The Untouchables is a great film. There, I said it. Perhaps that's not an altogether risky opinion. After all, most people would agree with me. However, some people  namely critics  would not hesitate to rank it several places lower on the gangster ladder than, say, The Godfather and Goodfellas. ""It's not as deep,"" they might say, ""pure entertainment."" This is exactly why I love this film and find it to be one of the best in the genre. It's not a rich character study, it's not a sweeping epic covering multiple generations, and it's not a twisted tale of corruption and redemption. It's just a damn fine piece of movie-making.The characters in this film are not fleshed-out, multi-dimensional, altogether interesting people. But this is not a knock against the film's quality; like everything else about the film, these individuals are highly stylized and lacking a fair amount of substance. They're larger-than-life heroes and villains. And it works. The story being told is a classical, metaphorical, allegorical tale of good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, white hats vs. black hats. There are no mentions of conflicted allegiances, double-agents, or self-serving motivations. It is just the good guys against the bad guys.It is true that the story takes many liberties with the real-life accounts of Eliot Ness and Al Capone. Large portions of the film are radically altered for dramatic and narrative purposes. Many characters never existed. But, again, this is not a fault of the film. This movie does not purport to be a documentary or even a historical retelling of famous events: it is just a movie. Situations and events must be dramatized to create suspense, to draw out sympathies, to direct the audience's feelings. I have no problem with fictionalizing historical events for the purpose of the narrative; after all, films are only 'based' on a true story.This movie is full of so many classic moments that it's difficult to pick a favourite. Of course, there's the memorable scene when the Untouchables embark on their first liquor raid. The wide, iconic shot of the four crossing the street, the fantastic production design remaking Chicago's beautiful La Salle street, Ennio Morricone's incredibly sweeping music  all combine to make a brief scene that is certain to be remembered on many a film montage in the future. There's the sequence at the Canadian border, which  despite my patriotism flinching at the pathetic portrayal of the Mounties  utilizes the same music and cinematography to maximum effect. And, obviously, there's the brilliant homage to the Odessa Steps scene in Battleship Potemkin, complete with a couple sailors caught in the crossfire. This climatic scene is by far the most thrilling of the film, stretching on for what seems like an eternity but never losing its suspense or excitement. It is, truly, a film of memorable moments.Sean Connery certainly deserved his Oscar, as he owns the screen whenever he's on it and makes us pine for him whenever he's off. His character is by far the most developed (despite the focus being on Ness) and thus his performance is by far the best. Costner is given little to work with besides a rather boring goody-two-shoes protagonist, and De Niro chews scenery like there's no tomorrow, but Connery draws us in and makes us stay there. It's one of the more deserving Oscar wins I can think of, and it's a fitting tribute to not only the actor, but to the film itself.As said before, this is definitely no Godfather. In fact, I would liken this film more to something like Star Wars than Scarface. It certainly owes much more to the pulpy serials of the '40s and '50s than the dark sagas of the '70s and '80s. It never pretends to be anything more than a piece of entertainment, and it excels at that brilliantly. Every single aspect of the production is top-notch, from De Palma's recognizable direction to Mamet's solid script to Morricone's amazing score, making for what I believe to be one of the greatest gangster films ever made and certainly a landmark in recent cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Surprisingly good,"It shows the true story of police officer Eliot Ness against gangster Al Capone. Honestly, I don't know how it really happened, so I'll evaluate the film's story only as an investigation and action film, and it manages to be incredible in that sense.It takes place during the prohibition in the 1930s in Chicago, which is dominated by smuggling and violence. The biggest gangster is Al Capone. Police officer Eliot Ness joins another group to capture him.The film's story is very well developed, with characters that quickly captivate us, especially Sean Connery's character, who is a great actor and it's hard not to like any of his characters, and also Eliot Ness himself, since the film shows a lot of his family and his ideals. The film has very well-filmed action scenes with a lot of violence, even the investigation part is good.The film's script is very good in my opinion. Sometimes it seems a little slow, but overall it manages to develop the story well, and in a way that makes it possible to understand what is happening.Visually, I found the film beautiful, the photography is good, the direction in some scenes is incredible, so that it manages to keep the viewer tense. The entire cast is good, especially Sean Connery, who even won an Oscar for this role, Kevin Costner and Robert DeNiro. The soundtrack is also a very positive point of the film, since it manages to convey the emotion of the scene.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A good gritty drama.,"THE UNTOUCHABLESI always avoided this film because it starred Kevin Costner. I am not a huge fan of his, but he has made some good movies.This movie is about a federal agent who is hell bent on arresting and convicting the infamous Al Capone. Federal agent Eliot Ness gets help from a beat cop, a rookie and an accountant.This drama is actually really good. I was expecting this to be a very slow film, but it wasn't. There were a lot of good action scenes and the gun fights were really good. In places this film was gritty and really sucked me in. It was interesting to see how the federal agent planned on convicting Al Capone, especially as Capone was a very dangerous man and was also bribing everyone. Eliot had a big problem trying to get anything to stick on him.The effects were not too good. There was one scene where a guy was falling from a roof top, but this was awful. You could clearly see it was a fake background as he was falling. It reminded me of a comedy film. The only other thing I can complain about the effects. When a guy got shot in the face, you saw the blood on the wall behind him, but he clearly didn't have an entry wound in his head. They didn't even try and make it look real.The acting was pretty good throughout. The film stars Kevin Costner in probably his best role I have seen him in. Other cast members were Sean Connery, Andy Garcia and Robert DeNiro. I thought this casting was perfect. I was not sure Sean Connery would be any good in this role either, but I have no complaints. He did a great job. The best performance for me though would be for Andy Garcia. I thought he did a brilliant job as the rookie.This is a very good drama and very entertaining.I will give this 7 out of 10.""You just fulfilled the first rule of law enforcement: make sure when your shift is over you go home alive.

"Iconic, but also sort of cliché","The Untouchables is an iconic film that has undeniably influenced pop culture, featuring legendary scenes such as the chilling ""knife"" moment, the gripping interrogation, the brutal baseball bat sequence, and the suspenseful station shootout (can't watch it without remembering The Naked Gun^^). Its impeccable production design and Ennio Morricone's masterful score elevate the experience, while Sean Connery's performance as Malone is a standout, supported by a strong overall cast.The film is intensely thrilling but leans heavily on clichés and overused tropes, with some awkward dialogue-especially involving Ness's family-and uninspired moments like the scene with the alderman. Certain camera angles and action sequences feel clunky, detracting from the otherwise polished aesthetic. While the movie captures a heroic and epic tone, it often sacrifices depth in favor of spectacle.Despite its flaws, The Untouchables is essential viewing, offering timeless entertainment and memorable moments, provided viewers are ready to embrace its formulaic elements.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Slightly Impressive Mob Film,"The Untouchables are very touchable actually in both the film and the movie itself. It's your average cops gone rouge to fight the mob story we've seen but with bonuses.Plot is simple. It's 1920's Chicago, and the mob is running wild. Al Capone runs the city and pays off the cops. Enter Agent Eliot Ness, who is sent to stop the crime wave with the help of some cops who are incorruptible.This film does some things right. First, I love Sean Connery as Malone. It's a good performance from a talented actor. Kevin Costner is average in his performance. Same with De Niro, which is disappointing considering his other performances in mafia/mob films like Once upon a Time in America and The Godfather Pt. 2. Also Andy Garcia was nice in his role too. The Music is overall to stylized to the 80's and disrupts the mood of the movie and some of the scenes just feel too much at times.Overall good but very unimpressive mob film. The performances are average( except for good old Sean) and music and stunts feel cheesy. Close to a 6 for me but I'll be nice. Hell, I'll be generous.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Dated and mediocre,"My, how filmmaking has moved on.
I guess Sean Connery was the main draw, but at this late stage of his career- portraying a VERY elderly cop on the beat - he clearly had a 'to hell with it' attitude and pretty much takes over the show while he's on screen. His shockingly unreliable Irish accent didn't stop him earning an Oscar.
Costner is as bland as a male model. Andy Garcia, normally excellent value, has very little to work with.
De Niro does his psycho gangster act AGAIN, all big cigars, pointless aggression, shouting at minions wearing an oversized cashmere coat. Essentially a pantomime act.
In short, from the viewpoint of 2021, the whole thing is basically rubbish. Dim witted, poorly written, boring, and De Palma's mannered direction is irritating and inappropriate for a period piece. A huge disappointment and sorry to say now best consigned to the dusty archives of cinematic history.
The real and unexplored story is how the US government - so eager to throw huge resource at external threats - only managed to barely tolerate a handful of plucky police standing up to the billion dollar Capone emipire. As ever, American corruption is the real story.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
De Palma's Masterpiece,"De Palma has always been a stylist, but many of his films have become examples of style over substance due to weak scripts. Here he has the luxury of working with a marvelous script by Mamet, one that is refreshingly simple and direct in pitting the good guys against the bad guys. De Palma's dynamic direction is marked by a fluid camera, aided by evocative sets, crisp cinematography, and another great score by Morricone. Costner is well cast as Ness, but is overshadowed by Connery as a seasoned cop and De Niro as Capone. The highlight of the film is the sequence at the train station that pays homage to the Oddessa steps scene of Eisenstein's ""The Battleship Potemkin.""",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Untouchables rivals with The Godfather,"It's the 1930's. Prohibition is affecting the nation. But, in the Windy City, there's a war waging. A war between the good guys and the bad guys. A war between the cops and the gangsters. A war between Elliot Ness and Al Capone.Brian De Palma's The Untouchables is a film that tells us that story and tells it very well, indeed. In the 1930's, Prohibition was affecting everyone. Businesses had to be shaken down by the law for illegal booze and drinks. Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) is the main character and leader of a squad of police officers who called themselves, The Untouchables. Ness and a fellow Irish cop, Jimmy Malone, (Sean Connery) enlisted Italian-American policeman George Stone (Andy Garcia) in the group along with accountant Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith). Together, their main objective is to bring down the big man who runs all of the illegal business in the streets of Chicago. And that name is Al Capone (Robert De Niro). After cracking down on illegal booze operations and successfully cutting off Capone's gangsters in Canada, the Untouchables gain popularity. Later on however, several members of the group are being killed off by Capone's right-hand man. It's up to Ness to go against Capone's right-hand man and also Capone.The film has a real sense of authenticity to the period era. De Palma has all of the right ingredients to make this picture works. From the cars to the guns to the clothes. The art direction is very well done and achieves the actual historic setting of the 1930's. What De Palma does in this film and his earlier gangster film, Scarface, is that he brings us into a glamorous world of the gangster life, but doesn't let the artistic details get in the way of the characters and the acting.As for the performances, I admired the supporting casting of Sean Connery as Jimmy Malone. Connery did win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in this movie. Connery does a very good as portraying Malone as Ness' mentor. In one particular scene where Ness is at a church and meets Malone for the second time, he gives Ness a little piece of advice. ""Shoot fast and shoot first."" Together along with Garcia and Smith, their chemistry is the most interesting part in this movie. For De Niro, I felt that he gives a mediocre performance as Capone. In my opinion, I had a very hard time accepting him as Capone, since his appearance doesn't necessarily match with the real Capone. Kevin Costner does a good job portraying a very young Elliot Ness. This young Ness is very different than Robert Stack's portrayal of Ness in the older version of the TV series.Even though The Untouchables is based on a true story and that it achieves on both style and authenticity, it is actually a fictionalized account on Ness and Capone. But, I think the reason why this movie is entertaining is that it's wonderful and great to look at and that we, as the audience can enjoy what is being done between both men who come from opposite sides of the law. I believe that this film rivals up there with The Godfather. What I mean by that comparison is that the two films presents us a glamorous look and feeling of the gangster world. It is lively and very colorful to look at, yet the characters are wrapped in their own situations where they have to deal with certain people in order to get the job done. In this case, The Untouchables is ambitious, yet it is not longer than Scarface.The Untouchables is a very good gangster film, both well directed and well art-directed. It's style and substance drives the energy toward the film, creating a sense of motion and ambition. The chemistry between Costner and Connery works and also it works for the members as well. Brian De Palma made a very modern version of the TV series and it's his best work since Scarface. ★★★ 1/2 3 1/2 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Great directing, Awful Score","I have to say, for the longest time i felt that this film was greatly underrated but these days I'm not so sure anymore. I mean don't get me wrong, I love De Niro, and he had the look and i suppose the attitude, but to me he didn't do the part of Al Capone any justice.I loved the directing of the move; definitely one of Brian DePalma's best. But the one thing that really really bothered me about this film was its musical score. The whole thing wasn't too bad, but at times, such as the opening credits and most of the sequences with De Niro on screen, the score had great musical themes, but was way to modernized and didn't fit the atmosphere at all. It had a hint of 80s, heavily reverbed drum beats that were entirely not necessary. Also, the use of some of the music in a few parts of the movie made the scenes seem a lot cheesier than they needed to be, and i had to sympathize with the actors that their abilities were diminished by the score.And one other thing that i would find negative about the film is that a death in the movie was played out very poorly and dragged on to an unrealistic amount of time for the damages done.But all minor complaints aside, the movie is very enjoyable and is definitely worth a watch.

"An excellent, larger than life depiction of the age of Capone","When wanting a classic, unashamedly audience-pleasing film, one need look no further than The Untouchables. The film is partially based on the 1950's television series of the same name, but updates the retelling a bit to better suit today's audiences. The story takes place in 1920's prohibition era, when it was illegal to drink or possess alcohol. Enter alcohol baron Al Capone (Robert De Niro) and his mafia, who begin bootlegging, or illegally distributing alcohol to the public. It is the duty of Treasury department agent Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) to stop Capone, and withhold the law, but his work proves difficult when he discovers no one is to be trusted; most everyone on the police force, media or any form of authority has been bribed by Capone to keep their mouth shut. To avoid detection, Ness assembles a handpicked team of 'untouchables', or law enforcers who refuse bribes. Jimmy Malone (Sean Connery, in an Oscar winning performance) acts as a mentor for Ness, teaching him how to get Capone before Capone gets him - shoot fast, and shoot first! 'George Stone', or Giuseppe Petri (Andy Garcia) is the youngest member of the team, a sharp shooting aspiring cop with old fashioned beliefs about law maintenance. Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith) is an unassuming accountant who gets dragged up in the plan, but ultimately proves an essential part of the team.Brian De Palma delivers a real masterpiece here, in what is easily one of his best films: the pacing is excellent, the cinematography is superb, marvelously capturing sensational (and Oscar nominated) 30's era sets, vehicles and costumes. (Robert De Niro's costumes were made exclusively by the real Capone's actual tailors) The great cast, of course, does nothing but add to the splendor, with Costner, Smith and Garcia all giving strong performances.Connery bestows his character with his usual charisma, and enough drama to well deserve his Oscar, and De Niro creates a wonderfully wicked villain, complete with a memorable bit with a baseball bat, easily giving a picture perfect portrayal of the original Capone. Add an excellent script by David Mamet with tons of memorable lines and a wonderfully flowing score by Ennio Moricone and you get a wonderful, larger than life piece of film history. That's the Chicago way.-9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Near Perfect,"It's no ""Godfather"" but it sure is entertaining. An excellent cast and tight directing make for a solid flick. Costner pulls off a decent lead but it's the costars here who really shine. De Niro, Connery, and García steal the show. Those three really brought it home. The set pieces were great throughout and the story flowed well from start to finish. The score was a little cheesy here and there and the cliches were plenty. De Palma is no Coppola but he does his best with what he's got. I appreciate the authenticity in this film and I'm glad to of seen this for a second time. I'm real pleased to know Connery won his only Oscar here and it was well deserved. Again, the costars really shine in this crime piece. The only one lacking was Costner. He wasn't bad just not as great. All in all, a near perfect film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Disappointing movie, which could of been so much better!","My expectations for this movie was of the man himself Al Capone, it would of suited this movie much better, Instead I receive a cliché cheese fest of a family 'crime' film which is definately what I did not want to watch. To make matters worse the effects in this film look so staged and just blatantly fake, a part where a person falls off the roof, made me laugh instead of showing remorse/empathy or whatever feeling the director was trying to make me feel. And what did not go was that the director didn't know if this would be family-based or actually gritty gangster style movie, watch for yourself and you should understand once the baseball bat scene comes into play.The director should of stuck to one perspective instead this film is messed up to the point I cringe.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent crime drama,"There is plenty of gun play and action in this movie, but where it really shines in my opinion is in capturing an era. The cars, the clothes, the street scenes, the buildings, the elaborate sets, create the image of a time gone by. The filming is done through the eyes of an artist.The cast is first rate. Eliot Ness is a perfect role for Kevin Costner - a what you see is what you get American hero with a passion for justice. Robert De Niro has played so many tough guys and mobsters that playing Al Capone is second nature to him; I just wish Capone and his mob had been a little better fleshed out here. Sean Connery steals the show in his Academy Award winning role as a beat cop who reluctantly signs up with Ness. And Andy Garcia's performance as another of Ness' team should not be overlooked. The music by Ennio Morricone creates tension and mood. All together, the production values are very high.And there are some great scenes, like Ness' group and the Canadian Mounties pincering a liquor run at a bridge - on horses no less. I'm easy, I thought the re-staging of the famous baby carriage scene from ""Battleship Potemkin"" in the context of a shoot-out was a knockout.I wish there had been more context given about the effects of the Eighteenth Amendment - maybe something that would give some perspective on our more recent war on drugs. But this movie is more to be enjoyed than thought about.Costner's last line does add a touch of irony and foreshadows the Twenty-first Amendment.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Pretty fair flick,"Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness didn't shine in this film, but Sean Connery did. His depiction of Malone, a tough Irish cop, is right on the money. This is the story of Eliot Ness and his small band of men against Alphonse Capone and his empire. The film depicts the ""Feds"" in some of their raids on Capone's empire. Some of them weren't successful and Ness and crew were the subjects of much ridicule in the press. This is no spoiler, but eventually they got Capone on a tax evasion charge. There is plenty of violence if you like that sort of thing. The film is told almost totally from the law's side, but, in the end, that was the only side that mattered. Robert De Niro shows how great an actor he is and is downright scary as Capone! Charles Martin Smith and Andy Garcia also star. I don't know how factual this film is, but I truly enjoyed it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

One of the Most Impressive Film Crews,"Went to a Morricone tribute concert last week and listened to this film's score. Needless to say I got emotional and I needed to check out this as soon as I could.The film doesn't need a review. The writing is sensational, the dialogue, the plot points, the cinematographic citationism, the acting-Sean Connery steals the spotlight for me-everything.The maestro transforms this gangster story into an epic adventure of humanity, family, where the streets of Chicago blend with the little but memorable Western bits. Goosebumps.Although it feels like a less serious and constructed version of Chinatown, the historical importance of this film is huge. What a crew, by the way.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"The Untouchables, touches great cinematic heights!","Brian De Palma found massive success with Scarface, so it is fitting that he here covers a story about the taking down of real life gangster Al Capone who was once known by that name.The film focuses on Eliot Ness and his small squad of ""Untouchables"" who went after Al Capone's bootlegging business in the late twenties / early thirties.The cast of this movie is absolutely spectacular, with many big names bringing their A-Game, none more so than Sean Connery who absolutely nails the portrayal of veteran cop, Malone. (He won an Oscar for it).The classical score is another brilliant Ennio Morricone masterpiece, and the cinematography is beautiful, making this an absolute joy to watch!Some poetic license is taken with the real life events, and characteristics of key players, but that should not detract from a movie which is a prime example of Brian De Palma at his very best!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

an exceptional masterpiece,"The Untouchables is undoubtedly the best movie I have ever seen. Everything is perfect: the actors with a great as usual Sean Connery, an extraordinary Capone-De Niro and a Costner as shy as usual but here it's perfect; the story which takes you for a walk inside the struggles of prohibition (story from David Mamet); the reconstitution of Chicago and all elements from the thirties; the music from Morricone. But the best thing of the movie is absolutely the directing from De Palma. It's so impressive to see how he makes you thrill with his camera moves. To me, the scene in the stairs is the best scene in movies story with all the thrill you feel in a few minutes.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A very fun gangster flick,"Gangsters. Cops. Tommy guns. Hand grenades. Bootlegging. Model T's. It's 1930 and the Prohibition war is raging. And thus we have The Untouchables. Al Capone practically runs the corrupt city of Chicago through his illegal liquor distribution. He has the entire city wrapped around his finger until Eliot Ness, a special agent from the treasury department, forms a group of incorruptible cops to take down Capone's entire operation. This group of cops will stop at nothing to uphold the law and bring down organized crime once and for all. And so we have an incredibly enticing Prohibition era tale with enough gangster action for the whole family! The film opens with a vivid overhead shot of Al Capone, played by the magnificent Robert De Niro, having a shave from his barber while reporters shuffle about the room waiting for Capone's face towel to be removed so that they can speak to him. The camera moves in closer to De Niro's face, still overhead. The barber removes his towel and Capone begins to speak about what it's like to be in control of the city and how he runs his crime operation. David Mamet's dialouge flows like gold and De Niro hits every profound line on the nose. In this one initial scene all of the great things about this movie have been established. We have Brian De Palma's excellent visual flare which captures the 1930's so well. We have Mamet's poetic yet raw dialouge that always impresses. And we have the establishment of the superb acting ability in this film, not only from De Niro, but from everyone. And so the film goes from there, telling an exciting story with loads of great characters, dialouge, and action.The Untouchables is loosely based on the 1960's television series of the same name, and it is pretty obvious. The film has a very serial feel to it, with a kind of television dialouge cadence that is also very fitting to the time period. It has a somewhat television look and feel to it, other than being incredibly graphic and loaded with plenty of foul language. It has an adventurous and fun mood, with a kind of mock-seriousness tone to it. But probably what makes it the most classic television-esque would be Ennio Morricone's excellent and commanding score. The score has a very powerful ability to make certain scenes very lighthearted and fun, so much so that you want to get up and cheer for the lovable heroes of this film. Then in other scenes, tragedy strikes and the score is so moving and so gripping that you're taken by surprise at how emotional the film has gotten all of the sudden. The whole film flows like this, making for a strange yet captivating watch.I have to say, don't expect The Godfather or Goodfellas going into this film. The Untouchables isn't nearly as complex and intricate as those films. The Untouchables is a different kind of film. It is driven by its cops and robbers mentality, probably because, unlike the aforementioned films, it is from the perspective of of the good side of the law, rather than the gangsters themselves. The film has to take on a completely different kind of approach to pull off what it is trying to accomplish. It isn't putting the gangsters in a good light. Al Capone isn't a character we pity at all. He is a character we hate, despise, and want revenge on just as much as the heroes of the film do. In all honesty, I prefer the stories told from the gangster point of view, but The Untouchables does an incredible job telling a story from the other side of the law.As far as gangster movies go, The Untouchables is different but great. Visually it is excellent and David Mamet's screenplay is pure genius. The whole cast gives great performances, especially Kevin Costner in the leading role as Eliot Ness. Sean Connery even won an Oscar for his role as Jim Malone, the aging Irish cop who goes about things in his own unique ways. Ennio Morricone lifts the film up with an incredible score that makes the whole film a joy to watch. This film is fun, yet moving, something a lot of films can't find a balance between. If you're a fan of gangster movies, definitely check this one out.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best,"Pretty much what has already been said covers it all. Fantastic film by De Palma. Great performance by the wonderful Connery.So many parts that you think ""oh, yeah, this is a good section' and continue to watch it! The part where they are in the train station and there's the woman with her baby in the carriage. Golly, there's just so much to that scene. When it becomes vital that Ness can trust Stone's aim.I just know that when I saw it recently and discussed it with my oldest brother, he mentioned that exact scene and said 'it doesn't get much better than that'. Which is everything in a nutshell.And of course, the wonderful period feel to much of the outdoor shots. Yeah, I know it's on a set somewhere, but it makes you feel like it's the 20s. And of course the fabulous line of 'it's not the Chicago way'.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Masterful manipulation of cinema clichés,"In a critical analysis of cinematic plots, ""The Untouchables"" emerges as a work that skillfully blends the nostalgia of a bygone genre, the gangster film, with a stylized and emotionally gripping recreation. Directed by Brian De Palma and written by David Mamet, the film presents a narrative that transcends mere historical retelling, delving into the realm of myth and the intelligent manipulation of cinematic emotional clichés.The plot follows Eliot Ness and his courageous companions, known as The Untouchables, during their fight against organized crime in 1920s Chicago, dominated by the iconic figure of Al Capone. The film portrays an era of widespread corruption, where Ness and his team's integrity stand out as a beacon of moral righteousness amidst the darkness of greed and violence.The aesthetic care and attention to detail in reproducing the atmosphere of the time are evident, reflecting the talent of the visual consultant and the considerable investment in production. The city of Chicago is transformed into a vibrant backdrop, where cinema supersedes reality, creating an immersive experience for the viewer.Mamet weaves a masterful screenplay, skillfully manipulating the archetypes of hero and villain, innocence and corruption, to create a compelling and emotionally charged narrative. Ness's exaggerated innocence and his relationship with the wise mentor Malone are familiar yet effective elements that add depth to the characters and plot.Narrative trickery is skillfully employed, challenging the viewer's expectations and providing thrilling twists. Moments like the famous baby carriage sequence on the staircase evoke not only De Palma's technical mastery but also an emotional depth that elevates the film above the conventions of commercial cinema.Ennio Morricone's music contributes to the cinematic atmosphere, enhancing the emotions and tension in each scene. De Palma's visual virtuosity, with his cameras exploring innovative angles and movements, captivates the viewer and brings the narrative to life in a compelling manner.It is important to note that despite Kevin Costner's less expressive performance as Eliot Ness, the film is sustained by Sean Connery's striking presence as the wise mentor Malone. Connery delivers a memorable performance, elevating each scene he appears in with his magnetic presence and ability to convey emotional complexity.Amidst all the narrative and visual artifice, ""The Untouchables"" reserves space for reflection on deeper themes such as the nature of justice, moral corruption, and the price of integrity. Ultimately, the film does not settle for mere emotional gratification but leaves a sense of melancholy, reminding us that the victory of the righteous often comes with sacrifices and losses.In summary, ""The Untouchables"" is more than a mere recreation of a cinematic genre; it is a work that transcends the boundaries of entertainment, offering a rich and emotionally engaging cinematic experience that endures beyond the screen, largely thanks to Sean Connery's masterful performance and Brian De Palma's remarkable mise-en-scène.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
1930's style film making with an 1980's touch.Excellent!,"What I like about this film is the way it takes on the atmosphere of a film actually produced in the 1930's,yet is injected with the grittiness and violence of modern day to show what things were really like in the era of Al Capone.This is what gives the film a unique appeal.Al Capone ruled Chicago,but he no doubt saw himself as king of the world,and Robert De Niro does an excellent job of bringing this across in his role as Capone.Also excellent is Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness,Andy Garcia as Stone,and Charles Martin Smith as Oscar Wallace.As excellent as all of these performances were,stealing the show from all of them is Sean Connery as Malone.It is in this film that Connery proved to us that he could be much more than that certain British super spy we all knew him as.His death scene is bar none the best I have ever seen in a film.Bar none!This is an excellent must see film!",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nearly made to perfection and De Palma at his finest.,"Updated version of the old tv series and based on the novel by Oscar Fraley, ""The Untouchables"" is fresh, smart, and ""extremely"" tense.  The film's story follows Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner in his best role and perfermance), a Treasury officer who is sent from D.C. to Chicago during Prohibition to enforce the law and discovers after a raid that there's corruption in the city's police force.  Ness begins the crackdown when he enlists the aid of three men: Jim Malone (Sean Connery), a Irish cop, a very raw and curious police recruit named George Stone (Andy Garcia), and Oscar Wallace (Charles Martin Smith), an accountant who Ness meets in his office. In that scene, Wallace tells Ness that one of the city's most notorious mobsters, Al Capone (played by Robert De Niro in an amusing yet in wicked fashion) has committed tax evasion.  Besides that scene and the one where Ness and Malone are together in the church, the film never shows any serious signs of letting down.  De Palma, who is also known for directing the classic bloodfest known as ""Carrie"", wisefully mixes in the sequences that either have action or Hitchcock-like suspense and squeezes in the ethinc conflict (Italians and Irish).  Besides that, two lesser known actors, Billy Drago and Richard Bradford are good here as Capone's swift and vicious enforcer Frank Nitti and the police chief who tries to convince Malone to stay out of the battle between Ness and Capone.  Screenwriter and Pulitzer-prize winner David Mamet wrote the maverlous script, Ennio Morricone conducts a priceless score, and Stephen H. Burum shows magnificant camera work.  The movie is nearly made to perfection and shows De palma at his finest.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
