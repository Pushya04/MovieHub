Exceed to Excess,"Every great gangster movie has under-currents of human drama. Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from ""Scarface"". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The darker side of the fabled ""American Dream"".Anybody complaining about the ""cheesiness"" of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana.This isn't Brian DePalma's strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another.The cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino's film. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something much more common from him nowadays), this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining (and intentionally over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa.Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. ""Scarface"" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you). An essential and accessible gangster flick, and a pop-culture landmark. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Al Pacino made it unforgettable,"Scarface is surely one of the best crime movie ever made.Al Pacino's performance as a sharp minded,angry,dangerous and powerful criminal is phenomenal.Al Pacino is playing a character which is brutal,angry,fearless and at the same time has love for his sister. Although movie is 2 hours and 50 mins long,but you will not find any dull moment in the movie.Alhough Al Pacino is playing a drug dealer but you will still like him as a person.Dialogues were excellent and there were couple of good songs in movie too.I also liked the way in which Al Pacino's character used to flirt with Michelle Pfeiffer's character.It was funny sometimes and was gentle too.I have seen many criminal movies but there is something special in Scarface.It is realistic and touching.This is Al Pacino's one of the finest performance.There was violence in some scenes but this is a crime movie and we expect some fighting scenes with violence.I heard a lot of positive things about this movie and when I finally watched it, I became its fan too. I am surprised that this movie even did not received any Oscar nominations.This movie surely deserves to be in top 250 list.Movie is a treat for Al Pacino's fans.This movie is recommended for all adults. Overall I give Scarface 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""You wanna play rough?? OKAY!""","""Scarface"" has a major cult following even now, 22 years after its release.It has also been widely criticized as being very tacky, unrefined, over-the-top and all bloated up! These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies. It is true that on the technical front, (cinematography, screenplay, direction, etc.) Scarface is way behind 'The Godfather'.But it is also true, that what Scarface has and some other gangster movies lack, is the rawness, the sheer crude approach of the gangsters. The Latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics like 'The Godfather' or 'Goodfellas'. This is one of the major winning points of Scarface and I strongly believe that this fact has been written off as ""tackiness"" by most critics! I have seen the original 1932 Scarface, and I must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the ""remake""!Al Pacino has been criticized to be over-the-top and loud in this movie. But how about considering that that is precisely the way the film-makers wanted Tony Montana's character to be! He is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute! He is not the calm Michael Corleone here. He is Tony Montana, a very tacky, uneducated individual who doesn't really think much and gets angry all the time!There is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie. The soundtrack is all 80s! I love some of the songs, including 'Gina and Elvira's theme', 'Push it to the limit' and the title track instrumental.There are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences, including the famous chainsaw scene, the Rebenga hit, the first meeting with Sosa and Tony's visit to his mother's.About the performances: Al Pacino is brilliant as the angry Cuban refugee. He has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana the most in his entire career. And it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes! One wonders what ""Scarface"" would be like without Pacino. I just couldn't imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana and in all probabilities, the film wouldn't be as effective without him!Steven Bauer shines as Tony's friend Manny.Robert Loggia is wonderful as Tony's boss, Lopez. So is F. Murray Abraham (as Omar) in a small role.Then there is some eye-candy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer. She looks beautiful and is adequate in her role.The director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax. Without revealing anything, I would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling.""Scarface"" is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out. Enjoy it for what it is: a raw portrayal of the Drug Lords and their gangland!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Real Scarface.,"""A Classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read. A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read."" -Mark Twain'Classic' seems to be the word used to describe ""Scarface"", Brian DePalma's 1983 film about opulence, self surrender, greed, and danger among Florida's drug ring. People and critics (and rappers for that matter) deem this film 'an epic gangster classic' or 'eptiome of gangster films.' When it is anything but. It is praised for all the wrong reasons. Scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over, but not all the praise it gets from audiences today, and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public.First off, the film is about a Cuban refugee, with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness. Simple? Yes. But the layers of De Palma's directing genius, and the great story written by Oliver Stone (yes I know, he actually wrote a real good one here) play into all of it. The characters are all looking for an escape, as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all. Each character has something to offer, that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film. They are entwined in a world of mystique and money, but all that has a price, as they all learn. Each character thinks they are getting better chances in life, when in true dramatic irony, they are actually getting worse. 'Tragedy' would be a better word to describe this movie. All those who praise the film for it's drug usage, it's violence, it's dialog, totally missed the point. There is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves. And that is why the film works so well. The devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film, not to look cool or attract viewers. Brian De Palma doesn't make movies for cult gangsters, or brainless action fans.Next on, the film is an adult drama. It is not a 'gangster film'. It has it's share of action, but the action is plotted very carefully, so it has a point. It's not like ""Aliens""- an example of a big dumb action film, and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people. Ridiculous. Hogwash. If this film is about that, then it is about how bad it is. Not a promotion of it.This being said, the film is indeed a great film. It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story. It has a very dramatic score (in true Giorgio Moroder style), which simply could give you chills, or bring you to tears. The film is rather lengthy, but it is a story, and each moment counts. The acting is terrific. Al Pacino - enough said. He can do any role that he puts his mind to, and this was no exception. Pretty boy Steven Bauer, as Manny. I didn't think much of him in other films he did, but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro De Palma's direction. Michelle Pfeiffer is a true gem as Elvira. Popping' fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in ""Grease 2"" she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye. But the three true diamonds in this rough are Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio as Tony's sister Gina, who when she smiles, or cries, we see her soul and her fresh way of living, and watch it deteriorate; Paul Shenar as Alejandro Sosa, a drug lord, who runs deeper than a river, and Shenar portrays him as so; and Miriam Colom as Tony and Gina's torn mother. These three dig the film as deep as it can go.This reviewer learned one main thing when watching ""Scarface"" for the first time. Always go into a film unsuspecting. All the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see. Only knowing De Palma (like I do) can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds. So ignore the rap crap, ignore the mindless violence supporters, and fix yourself a glass of Bailey's on the rocks, and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film, the real ""Scarface.""",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Grandiose, bloodyminded and implacable","This is one of my all time favorites.If the movie has a flaw, it's that it comes at you like a raging bull. It doesn't so much engage the viewer as assault him. ''Scarface'' is as voracious and unyielding a production as Tony Montana himself. Nothing is left to the viewer's imagination.Moroder's languorous synthpop fits the action to a tee. Like the chorus in a Greek tragedy, it wails and gnashes, broods and tugs, a constant reminder of Tony's inexorable fate.Not so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress, ''Scarface'' rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pure Pacino,Pacino gives an amazing performance that is both comic and tragic in this remake of the 1932 classic about corruption in America.Brian De Palma updated the original Prohibition story to the era of the Mariel boat-lift and the heavy traffic in drugs that still infest the United States. The film is an uncompromising revelation of humanity's dark side as Pacino's character learns never to underestimate the other guy's greed. He neglects to learn the other important lesson -- never get caught in the vice you are pushing on others.Pacino's character wants the world and everything in it. That's what he gets. We are reminded to beware of what we wish for.The film is violent but never makes drug dealing seem glamorous.,,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Loved, But For The Wrong Reasons","Many people like this movie and many more love it, but it seems that it is all for the wrong reasons. Scarface should be liked and loved but not in the way it has been or is.Many people say the acting was over-the-top, but who better to do an over-the-top character than Al Pacino. To say that Pacino went over-the-top in here would be an understatement. Yet he does it so well, he just brings the inner devil out of you so well. His character Tony Montana was not such a great guy to begin with but his thirst for power just bring his sickness of greed to another level; an inhumane level. Sure at times Pacino seems to be a bit cartoonish and surreal but that does not at all to me seem to be a liability at all. The supporting cast served its job very well. Michelle Pfeiffer was not really at her best but she certainly fit the role she played. On the other hand Steven Bauer was at his best, still he is Steven Bauer. Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was good and like Michelle Pfeiffer fit her role very well. Robert Loggia I have always enjoyed watching in just seeing him yell. Other than Pacino they were not really any standout or memorable performances. Everybody just seemed to fit their roles by being there. They did not fit in perfectly but were convincing enough.Brian De Palma did a very good job directing this movie. Whenever an actor is able to become larger than life with his performance some credit should be given to the director and I will certainly give De Palma that. Brian De Palma, though not given the respect, is a very versatile director by my count. He knows how to direct movies according to their genres, but that at times has not turned out well. In here it does, this is by all counts a gangster movie but few are much better than this one because of De Palma.The writing was great it was just pure Oliver Stone. When I saw the credits at the end of this movie and saw that Oliver Stone had written this I was not the least bit surprised. That is a testament to him though. I have always though of him as a great writer and to me he proves this once again with Scarface. Nobody knows how to write a surreal reality for a movie than Oliver Stone.The music was good but not that great. It is certainly not my favorite from Giorgio Moroder. The music was a little bit too 80s-ish for me but it didn't annoy me. The cinematography was good, not amazing but really who cares with a movie like this.This has probably been one of the most influential movies in the past 25 years but as mentioned before it is for the wrong reasons. People should realize that the character of Tony Montana is no hero, he is a monster. He is not inspiring in anyway. He is greedy, bloodthirsty, uneducated and self consumed. Yet he is a role model to many people because he is in some way or another a rebel but probably most of all because he is a deluded gangster. A vigilante would be like Mother Tereasa next to Scarface.The good thing about this movie though is that it shows that the Tony Montanas' are not the real problem. If we or the people of authority would want to shut people like him down we could do it but we don't. In a freaky twisted way he is a necessity of our society. He is somebody you could blame everything on and fell better about yourself doing it. The Tony Montanas' of this world are the scapegoats of our society. This in no way excuses people like him. Instead it is more of a reminder that we shouldn't excuse or allow ourselves to do bad things just because we measure up or think we measure up compared better to a gangster or drug dealer. I love this movie because it is more than a corruption movie, it is a movie that in a strange way makes you self reflect.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The 80's and how not to live them...,"Ya know when one looks at this Brian DePalma film today, I'm sure there has been a lot of criticism about how dated it is. Also, about the violence. When I looked at this film on VHS when I was 20, I thought it was ulta-violent and gritty as well. But I didn't get 'it'.A few decades go by and man, how I know how much I didn't get in this film!! This is a remake of an excellent film which was done back in the 30's/40's. How can you improve upon a classic? Ya don't. But you tell a tale that is brought up to date through the eyes of the ""new immigrants"" during the most greed ridden decade, the over indulgent 80's. DePalma, Stone and the gang present an ambitious, disturbing and darn right good film.Yes....Disco was dying and New Wave/Punk were taking over but these immigrants from Cuba who had to make a new home in Florida couldn't tell the difference. It was exciting, it was what they wanted but how to get it???? To these immigrants, there was only one way to get it in Florida where they were..by having lots of money and to get the money, you had to take over running a drug empire.Al Pacino was fantastic to me as Tony Montana, the ""little train that could"". What an amazing way to have your lead character look at America: to fight, kill, steal. lie, cheat all to get -- ""the money, the women and the power.""That's what Tony saw as the American dream.He wanted it, he wanted to live it and in his circle saw nothing wrong with how he went to get it. Tony Montana's command of the English language was heavily saturated with the ""f"" word but what did you expect, Emily Post's finishing school for him and his co-horts? Look at how they CAME to America, what they knew, what they were exposed to. This is the way Tony and his crew chose to ""be all they can be in America."" It was all about the power. Tony Montana would and did ANYTHING to achieve it..it all its violent, lying, stealing, crooked, thieving glory.The part of the film that personified the 1980's to me, is the money laundering. Tony's crew bringing sacks of drug money to the bank. Did those around Tony and his crew care? At the clubs where he spent and drank? Nope. Money was money and with money, you get the power. Tony was living high off the hog. He and his pretty blond American trophy he married played well by Michelle Pfieffer.After Tony Montana's rise to power, he finds out its really crappy up there. He's riddled with doubt, he's drug addicted, he's paranoid, he's surrounded by those who want to take him on in a bloody take-over, his trophy 80's American blonde drug addicted wife he finds out is a bore, he needs to keep atop of his empire because...he's going down. And down he goes in a horrific violent fashion, but again I ask, what do you expect?This is the quintessential 1980's film telling you a warped tale of how some misunderstand the American Dream...to obsession. It's violent, bloody, overly so..but it drives the point disturbingly home. Not all Cubans thrown out of Cuba who landed in Florida in the 80's were anything like Tony Montana. Give me a break. But the showing of how miserable the 1980's were with its emphasis on greed and money as the only measures in the USA to ""be somebody"" and have power took its tool on these poor characters and their lives in America.Makes you wonder -- has anything from then -- been learned today?",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Decent movie, good movie, not a great movie","While I enjoyed it as a pop-corn flick, this movie to me is not at all what it was hyped up to be. I was promised an action-packed thriller of a movie with fantastic performances and ambiguous characters. This movie is not that. The pacing is awful, the performances apart from Pacino are decent but not outstanding, and the film drags on for a good 30 minutes more than it needed to. Cut a couple scenes of Tony Montana basically holding a monologue about politicians, bankers, and money, and you'll have a much more concise movie which delivers the same message. Don't worry, the underlying theme isn't lost on me, I just feel like some scenes could've done with more subtlety, your viewers aren't stupid, no need to spell his maniacal outbursts out to us over and over.Overall, it's a movie I can see myself watching and enjoying again in a couple of years, but it's neither a cinematic masterpiece nor a film with a lot of replay value.If you love this movie, don't be angry at me. You're entitled to your opinion, I don't mind people praising it. It's just not what I wanted out of the experience personally.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This is GREAT,"Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone, ""Scarface"" is a movie that will not be forgotten. A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana (Pacino) comes to America for the American Dream. Montana then becomes the ""king"" in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his empire of crime in Miami, Florida. This gangster movie is very violent, and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. This movie has around 180+ F-words and is almost three hours long. This movie is entertaining and you will never get bored. You cheer for the Drug-lord, and in some scenes you find out that Montana isn't as evil as some other Crime Lords.

One Word: PERFECT!!!!!!!,"Scarface has a great storyline, brutal violence as well as having Al Pacino at one of his finest roles. Scarface is one of the best gangster dramas!",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Say hello to my little friend,"One of the most recognized quote from a movie ever. Even to those who haven't seen the movie. It's sort of Pacinos equivalent to De Niro ""You talkin to me?"" scene from Taxi Driver. Not comparing those movies of course. If you want to compare movies, you could compare this to the 30s original with Paul Muni. A movie that Pacino watched in a cinema and made him want this movie. Made him want to be as mesmerizing and have a powerful role. Add Oliver Stone and others to make this happen and you have an amazing movie.Now at the time it was released people were disgusted by this. Thinking of Tony Montana as role model or maybe fearing he could be just that. And he has become a cultural influence and to some an idol. The movie did not intend it or the character to be viewed as such. You can't blame the movie for how people reflect and adapt to what they see.You can blame the critics for not giving it enough credit. While the original set a standard and was used as a rough blueprint (some scenes are reminiscent of the original), this did many original things that we had not seen before, like a chainsaw scene. So not for the squeamish or the ones who are easily offended. All that taken into account it is a travesty Pacino did not win an Oscar for his performance. It's an even bigger travesty he wasn't even nominated! Actually the movie had even a Razzie nomination ... which is almost funny while simultanously sad too.The movie may be long but it needs time to unfold. It is bigger than life, has many tips of the hat to the original (the world is yours) and might be one of the few cases where the remake is at least as good as the original. Highly recommended to anyone who loves action movies and dramas combined",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Dynamic Performance by Pacino,"In 1983, Director Brian De Palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an American gangster, and that he did-- with the help of a terrific screenplay by Oliver Stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast. The result was `Scarface,' starring Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles.  The story begins in May of 1980, when Castro opened the harbor at Mariel, Cuba, to allow Cuban nationals to join their families in the United States.  125,000 left Cuba at that time, for the greener pastures of freedom in America, and most were honest, hard-working people, thankful for the opportunity they had been granted.  But not all.  Among the `Marielitos' who streamed into Florida, approximately 25,000 had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of Cuba's jails-- criminals considered beyond redemption, who Castro had merely wanted to be rid of.  And they, too, saw America as a land of opportunity, even as Al Capone had considered Chicago some fifty years earlier.  And among the most ambitious was a man named Tony Montana (Pacino), known to his associates as `Caracortada.' Scarface.Now that he was free of the yoke of Communism under which he had grown up, Montana wanted what he felt was coming to him, and he wanted it now; and from the moment he stepped off the boat in Florida, he was determined to have it all.  Wealth and power-- that was Montana's dream, and he would get it by doing what he did best, beginning with a favor for a man living in Miami by the name of Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia).  Lopez, it seems, had a brother in Cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of Castro's goons, a man who, having outlived his usefulness to Castro, had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in `Little Havana,' along with Montana and all of the Cubans just off the boats, where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives.  And in short order, Montana sees to it that Lopez's brother has been avenged, and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of America.Lopez, a wealthy businessman with the right connections, in return for the favor gets Montana and his friend, Manny (Steven Bauer), released from the holding camp, and puts them to work.  In his day, Capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain, but Lopez has the modern day equivalent, and it's even more lucrative: Cocaine.  Lopez takes Montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life, but once he has a taste of it, Montana isn't satisfied with whatever crumbs Lopez sees fit to throw his way, and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be:  At the `top.'  With a cold-blooded, iron will, Montana decides he'll do whatever it takes to get there, no matter what the cost.  but before it's over, he will realize the price for his dream, and he'll pay it; but for a brief moment, perhaps he will know what it's like to be The Man.  And he will also know whether or not it was worth it.In step with De Palma's vision, Pacino plays Montana larger-than-life, and he does it beautifully.  From the accent he affects (which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right-- and he did), to the body language and the attitude, he's got it all, and it makes Montana convincing and very real.  What he brings to the role is nuance and style, in a way that few actors (De Niro would be one) can.  This is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way, nor is there anything about Montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level; but Pacino's screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character, even though it's hard to become emotionally involved with him.  It's quite simply a dynamic, memorable performance.Michelle Pfeiffer gives a solid performance, as well, in the role that put her on the path to stardom.  As Elvira, the woman who becomes an integral part of Montana's dream, Pfeiffer is subtle and understated, giving that sense of something going on underneath, while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance.  She, like Pacino, definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic, enigmatic and sultry demeanor.The supporting cast includes Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (Gina), Miriam Colon (Mama Montana), F. Murray Abraham (Omar), Paul Shenar (Sosa) and Harris Yulin (Bernstein).  An excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed `Traffic,' and `Blow,' and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of Peckinpah's `The Wild Bunch,' De Palma's `Scarface,' originally panned by critics, has since been cited by many as being the definitive American gangster saga.  Much of the violence is implied rather than graphic, but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing.  But if you stay with it, there is a lesson to be learned in the end.  And like many lessons in life, the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time.  But the reward is always worth it, and that's the way it is with this film.  I rate this one 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scarface,Amazing movie and amazing performance by Al Pacino as Tony Montana,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Violent chronicle  about  the rise and fall of a dangerous gangster and easily ranks as one of the very best in  the mobster genre,"Remake from classical movie titled Scarface (1934) , in fact , De Palma's Scarface is dedicated to Ben Hecht and Howard Hawks. When Fidel Castro opens the harbor at Mariel, Cuba, he sends 125,000 Cuban refugees to reunite with their relatives in the United States. Among all the refugees, there is one who wants it all, his name is Tony Montana (Al Pacino reportedly stated that Tony was one of his favorites of all the characters he's played) but the world will remember him by another name , Scarface , being a fictional character . In 1980 Miami, a determined Cuban immigrant takes over a drug cartel while succumbing to greed . As Tony and his faithful friend Manny (John Travolta was considered for the role of Manny Ribera but was to Steven Bauer who is the only actual Cuban in the main cast and subsequently married Melanie Griffith) arrive in the U.S. and beginning working small time jobs importing and exporting cocaine. Soon, they are hired by Omar Suarez (during filming F. Murray Abraham was notified that he had won the part of Antonio Salieri in Amadeus) to do business to a group of Colombians. When the issue goes awry , Tony and Manny leave with the money and flee rapidly . Soon after , Tony meets with drug ringleader Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia , outstanding as a rival gangster) and falls for his boss's girl , Elvira (Michelle Pffeifer , Kay Lenz, Glenn Close , Kelly McGillis and Kristy McNichol both reportedly wanted the role , but De Palma turned them down). Later on , Tony reunites with his mother and sister (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).This exciting film packs thrills , chills , noisy action violence and results to be pretty entertaining , in spite of its long runtime , as it runs nearly three hours . It's one of the most violent , gruesome , thrilling intriguing gangster move ever made . Al Pacino , in the title role , is firs-rate as the Cuban gangster and receives magnificent support from Steven Bauer , Robert Loggia, Mark Margolis , Harris Yulin and early deceased Paul Shenar gives a bravura performance as a Colombian kingpin . Interesting screenplay by Oliver Stone who wrote this film while fighting a cocaine addiction . The original idea was to make this film a remake of Scarface, which took place in Chicago, but this proved to be impossible due to budget constraints. There was a huge controversy in the city of Miami during the making of the film over whether the producers should be allowed to shoot in the city. The Miami Tourist Board decided not to allow filming, as they were afraid the movie would discourage tourism to Miami, particularly as it showed Miami's latest Cuban immigrants as gangsters and drug dealers. A majority of the film was shot in Los Angeles, California standing in for Miami, Florida. This was done because production would have been endangered by protest from angry Cuban-Americans over the film's reported subject matter. Streets and buildings used for shooting were redressed by the art directors to have the 'feel' of Miami. The movie displays a colorful cinematography by excellent and veteran cameraman John A Alonzo . Furthermore , it has a commercial musical score composed by synthesizer by usual of the 8os , Giorgo Moroder. The motion picture was very well directed by Brian De Palma who liked the script so much that he dropped out of directing Flashdance to direct this film. Ranked #10 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Gangster"". Scarface, the version starring Paul Muni, was ranked #6 in June 2008",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Scars & Torture, Visible & Unseen...","It's a story about a misogynistic psychopath with sister issues who develops drug and alcohol dependency and carries an exceptionally large chip on his shoulder: Al Pacino captures that character to perfection. Without him the film would probably have been forgotten some time ago, the rest of the cast are quite forgettable in comparison but so is the story which adds little or no value, unless you have aspirations along the lines of the scarred man or recognise some of his attributes in yourself or someone you know.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Taking advantage of the land of the free. Crime does have a price.,"Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma, SCARFACE paints a picture not easily forgotten. Al Pacino turns in a stunning performance as Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee than becomes a powerful player in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his self made kingdom of crime in Florida.

Scarface,"I find myself enjoying this film when I watch it. Well, perhaps enjoying is a bit of an odd verb when you think of the storyline, its characters, the amount of violence and of course, the f-bomb being dropped about 15,000 times.I like Pacino in this film. He shows us the violent anger we didn't see in Michael Corleone. We're Michael would say, ""Never hate your enemies, it clouds your judgement,"" Tony Montana's out killing everybody. Now granted, there are moments in his performance...or in the script where you have to laugh. The questioning scene in the beginning of the film is a fine example of this. When asked where he got that scar on his cheek...well, I can't write what he says in the regular version, but I will tell you that on edited version on TNT, it from was ""eating pine apple.""There is a great performance from Robert Loggia. He's the only character I truly believed in the film. Frank was a businessman, not a killer. All he wanted was the money. Greed killed him, as it has killed so many people. I enjoyed the direction Loggia went with Frank. It has carried over his recent work and has made Loggia one of Hollywood's must durable supporting actors.Brian DePalma adds his usual blend of violence, but it seemed that for once, he was trying to make his own film. Not borrowed. No guessing games on who he stole from this time. Although he's blasted for the film's content, it is a new beginning to his career which took off, but it was really ""The Untouchables"" that made me consider him a serious director.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A misunderstood and very unappreciated film,"Scarface is a very violent and bloody film? No, it is not, even in its time. There is a very famous chainsaw scene, of course there are killings and gunfights, but these do not make the movie so violent and bloody. Especially, if we live in 2000s when some movies with extreme violence and blood have been made. For the squeamish, Scarface might be pretty disturbing, but otherwise it is just as violent as a crime movie. Then, why do people call especially Scarface violent and bloody while Goodfellas or The Godfather are violent and bloody too? I don't know. Secondly, as I see, some hate Scarface because according to them, some people, especially wannabe youths imitate the character, Tony Montana. However, the question is does it make the movie awful? Then, let's put all the gangster movies including The Godfather into a basket and then burn it. Scarface is a masterfully directed, masterfully executed, masterfully acted and visually so stylish crime film by Brian De Palma. Scarface is a so stylish movie from the cinematography to the art direction. As for the script, I think it is Oliver Stone's one of the best works as writer (especially in terms of story editing in contrast with Heaven and Earth) I agree that the movie is shallow throughout, but not flawed even a moment. It is 170 minutes approx. so as it is understood, it is an epic! What is the advantage of the long duration then? We can see the life of Tony Montana, Scarface in detail which means satisfying. The movie or the characters are not deep at all, but personally, I did not even mind it while watching, because everything else was great? By the way, sorry, but why did you expect a deep character study? It is a crime epic and if Al Pacino is one of your all time favorite actors like me and if you like De Palma's style, then there is no possible way to dislike the movie. If you did, then congratulations, you are one of a kind. Personally, I like De Palma very much, for me, he has more than one masterpiece in his filmography like Body Double or Casualties of War and Scarface is one of them. Now, it is time to talk about Al Pacino. However, before that I want to say that this is a fast moving and ''event driven'' movie, not a character driven movie, but still Al Pacino is great in this movie and he gives a great performance. Tony Montana is not someone likable, because he is always angry, so angry and he trusts nobody, but Pacino makes him one of the most remarkable (and likable?) movie icons ever. Therefore, by Pacino, Scarface was a character who I hate and also like. And there is a gunfight sequence, one of the best parts of the movie for sure, it recalls John Woo movies and it is almost obvious that Brian De Palma was inspired by John Woo. We are talking about one of the best gunfight sequences ever. It was a 'edge of the seat' gunfight sequence and it does not happen often! so the importance of that sequence especially comes from that, but of course also it is impressive, stylish and entertaining, if entertainment is the right word in this case. Lastly, I have seen the original 1932 version and it was excellent too. Both movies are excellent in its own way. It was an early Warner Bros style gangster film and and this remake is one of the best movies of all time too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"A captivating movie, superb performance from Al Pacino","Tony Monteiro leaves behind a life in Cuba, for a new one in The USA, where he climbs from the very bottom, to a life where he has almost everything he'd hoped for, unfortunately for Tony, a life of excess proves to be his downfall.Scarface well and truly deserves its cult status, and there's no denying, it is a classic.It is superbly written, hugely entertaining, gritty, compelling and sometimes humourous, best of all, the movies has several incredible performances.It's loaded with classic scenes, the one that has always stood out for me, is that dinner scene, where Tony and Elvira now seem to actively detest the sight of one another.Unapologetically violent at times, it doesn't seem to glamorise the drugs scene, it sets about showing it for exactly what it is.Al Pacino is phenomenal, at times you forget that Pacino is actually acting, he's captivating. Michelle Pfeiffer is terrific, as are the rest of the supporting cast.This film truly has the power to draw you back over and over, three hours pass by very quickly.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
FLAWLESS!!,"I don't think anyone involved in the making of this film knew how ICONIC this project was going to be. A classic is an understatement to describe this movie. Al Pacino did an amazing job playing Tony Montana, he really brought so much life into this character, almost a life of his own. Tony Montana has been and is still mentioned across other Movies/Shows and hip hop culture. Up to this very day we still see him on clothes and social media. I hardly hear people mention Tony Montana being played by Al Pacino... most time people talk about Tony as if he has his own existence and that alone is LENGENDARY acting. This is definitely a strong cast of characters and actors.This film is so realistic in a sense that there are many people who believe this is based on a true story. The storytelling is amazingly paced and the plot is strong, the ending is phenomenal leaving no room for questions. We literally see the lows, the high, and then the lowest of Tony Montana. Scarface set the bar high for Gangster Films because I have yet to see a gangster film even come close to being compared to Scarface.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Encapsulation of 1980s excess,"It's easy for many other reviewers to write off Scarface as a trashy violent movie - but they're missing the point. The point being that Scarface is all about a life of excess. It's also a cultural touchstone, and a deliberate time capsule of the greed of the 1980s. It's all rolled up into a film to be fed to the audience at a drug-fueled pace.The movie has multiple comments about living a life of excess, what's really important in life, and critiques the illusory ""American dream"" - with all the subtlety of a bullet to the head. Tony asks the viewer if they have the guts to really ""be what they want to be"". The film takes that recurring theme and pushes it to the limit.Al Pacino's performance is iconic, often mimicked, and so completely over-the-top to the point of it being unintentionally funny. It's endlessly rewatchable. There are so many quotable lines in the film, including a comical overuse of f-bombs. Giorgio Moroder's haunting synthwave soundtrack perfectly captures the 1980s, and smears itself all over the extremely visceral violent action scenes, drenched in neon pink and blue.Whether you love or hate it, it's a film that will refuse to leave you once you see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"A good film, but extremely overrated and didn't reach my expectations","I think scarface was a good film but is so overrated that it spoils the film if you hear about it before you watch it. Before i watched scarface, everybody told me it was a cinematic masterpiece, but when i watched the actual film I didn't see it as the as great powerful film it is portrayed to be. I thought it was decent and a good watch, but I don't particularly like Al Pacino as an actor, and think he is not in the same league as robert de niro and Jack nicholson, as many people see him. I enjoyed the godfather and liked al pacino in that as he was quieter, and less arrogant than in scarface , but i have yet to see scent of a woman, where i am hoping to see Al Pacino in a different way, other than the sick individual he plays as tony montana and not so much but to a certain extent michael corleone, where he has been, in both the godfather and scarface, involved with murder and illegitimately earning lots of money and respect.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Remarkably overrated....,"I found this mostly unbearable to watch. I struggled through the gratuitous violence, horrible overblown acting, specifically from Pacino.

Anyways, all said and done, I did laugh out loud a few times... Very overrated flick!",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
De Palma's finest work,"SCARFACE is definitely Brian De Palma's best film and the only one that isn't flawed or too violent and disturbing. It follows the story of a Cuban refugee in Florida who eventually becomes a major drug lord through connections with a powerful Columbian cartel boss. His best friend is Manny, played by Steven Bauer in his best performance yet, who is the more humorous of the two and is the only man Tony can always rely on. More strong supporting roles by Loggia as Montana's old boss, Michelle Pfeiffer as his love interest, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as his sister whom he is sickly protective of and a fine cameo by F. Murray Abraham as his ill-fated partner who gets whacked in a memorable scene.De Palma balances humor, violence, love and drama very well in this film. Nearly all the characters are fascinating and well created, like in his second best film ""Carlito's Way"", and the dramatic intensity remains as strong throughout the movie. From the rebuking by his mother through his difficult relationship with Elvira and finally the ultimate tragic ending, this movie is not an easygoing affair. Yet its suspenseful twists and interesting characters make you sit all the way through it's 170 minutes and the ending leaves you emotionally shaken. There is a lot to pity in Tony and his dark and violent end. Al Pacino turns in a simply breathtaking performance which is one of the strongest points of this film and the very reason why you can't get your eyes off the screen. He gives his character a unique emotional weight and strength.This is indeed a work which belongs up there with all the best.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One Man Show,So many have already commented on this movie that I don't have much to add. I just want to say that this violent black comedy has one of the most memorable characters in all of movies. It's also one of the most quotable films of all time. As the immigrant Tony makes his way to the top by dropping people in huge quantities and manipulating a system that plays into his hands. He is a juggernaut and why he rises as he does when he is often clueless is quite amazing...and we buy it. Pacino takes his Corleone character to the Nth degree by pretty much taking the humanity out of him. We love him; we hate him; but we certainly can't ignore one of the most off-the-wall performances of all time.,8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Timeless Great,"Whilst a little long, ""Scarface"" produced a movie well worth the old perusal. Al Pacino was his regular solid self, and Michelle Pfeiffer fairly ordinary which is to be expected. The degree of violence and swearing in the movie was an indication of the direction these kind of movies were taking as the eighties rolled into the nineties.This is another movie you can't help but admire the wardrobe on. The sheer arrogance of the manner the leads wear their clothes allows them to pull off a look that is laughable, yet amazingly stylish. One must applaud such a show. On top of all this, a well directed and written script allows the audience into what is quite likely an accurate portrayal of the Miami underworld.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Went from Amazing to mediocre very quickly.,"The movie when it started felt like it was going to be a timeless classic but then it started to feel like it was loosing its way or going off track. It went from a 10 to an 8 after about an hour and while it was okay, it seemed to be going nowhere and ended as a 7/10.10-8-7.So that's my rating for this film. I don't know how to describe it. It definitely won't stay with me for long and will be forgotten too soon. There's nothing so great about this movie and the 8.3 rating for it seems to high. The acting seems like that of a B-grade movie. Starts off as A grade but like I said, the movie loses steam and thus even the acting starts seeming hammy. I really love Pacino, but the screenplay is far from interesting to feel like he did a fine job as no actor is above the script and an actor can only be as good as the script. As someone said before, this is like a very cheesy, popcorn movie, which is not a bad thing but it also isn't true cinema. Wish it had a better written screenplay. This movie had so much potential but the end result sadly is an okay film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""The World Is Yours""","""Scarface"" is one of the greatest of all mob movies. It's an epic crime drama done with style and care. Brian De Palma presents a film that ignites the screen with a great screenplay by Oliver Stone and an amazing performance by Al Pacino. For those unfamiliar with the story, Scarface follows the path of Tony Montana, a charismatic Cuban refugee, who arrives in Miami looking for the American dream. Tony's up-front and tough personality makes him go right to the top of the cocaine underworld. However, no one, as they say, stays at the top forever. There are consequences to his success, and as Tony learns, money and power can't give you everything. A special mention should go to Michelle Pfeiffer, who superbly plays Tony's love, in what was her first major film role. This film is not for the faint at heart as directer Brian De Palma 3 times had the film rejected because it had and X-Rated certificate. He literally had to take the people who give the certificates out to court. Although grotesquely brutal this movie could teach kids good lessons that crime does not pay as when he gets to the top of the underworld his life corrupts through cocaine and he ends up killing the ones he loves and watching ones he loves die in crossfire.The film is famous for it's scenes of violence, including a victim chained to a shower and killed with a chainsaw. Director Brian DePalma, not really known for excess gloriously lavishes in it here and films his movie with style and gusto, ""Scarface"" is unique because it feels like it was made with real respect for the material. Consider that you have one of Hollywood's future greatest directors writing the script and one of American film's most stylish talents directing and on top of that, an iconic actor in the lead role. Even the moody main theme is composed by none other than Giorgio Moroder. The ending is especially deliciously bloody, as if a normal shoot-out is for sissies. ""Scarface"" remains a potent movie because it has themes we can all relate to, we all want wealth, power and at least one beautiful woman, ""Scarface"" asks the question of what extremes would one go to to achieve wealth, and is it worth anything when it is dirty money?Overall rating: 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scarface,"Despite all the hype and plaudits, I don't think this film is as good as Paul Muni's 1932 iteration. That's not to say it isn't a good film, nor that Al Pacino doesn't turn in a good effort - it's that it is all so brash. The language and action has no subtlety or finesse to it. It glorifies violence - it's not just that it is a necessary evil in the world in which ""Tony Montana"" works, it just comes across as if there was nothing in the script and the film had to be padded out somehow - so let's shove in some more brutality. There is precious little sophistication with the characterisation either - and after a while that all just grates. Top drawer production and scoring, though - and some fine supporting efforts from Robert Loggia and Steven Bauer but for me it was all just a bit in my face when just a little more effort and better scripting could have improved it no end. Good, but not great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
highly overrated,"Everyone has heard of this movie. The general assumption is that this movie is one of the greatest gangster films that there is. I am inclined to disagree with this. Yes this movie has some great moments, but it does not deserve the credit it gets.Al Pacino is a great actor, and I don't deny this, but there are to many times in this movie where he seems to overplay the part. Michelle Pfiefer is horrible in this movie, probably her worst performance ever. As for most of the other actors who did not make it big, it is very much because they're not good actors. Al Pacino's brother in the movie seems totally scripted.Anyway, as for the plot, it is boring, and overused. Man gets rich, and the people he stepped on to get there come after him. It's boring and predictable because of this. If I were doing this movie, I would cut so much. We don't need the restaurant scenes which do not advance the movie. We do not need a scene with Al pacino in a hot tub having the same argument he had around 5 other times in the movie.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
an insight into Miami's drug empire,"In the tradition of the Godfather films, director Brian DePalma has brought Oliver Stone's creation Scarface to the big screen. It is the archetypal `rags to riches' story of a young Cuban refugee named Tony Montana. Al Pacino more than fulfils this role as he conveys the ruthless nature of Montana and likewise the ruthless nature of Miami's Cocaine underworld. Although Montana's ultimate position in life is morally wrong, he is a character with unequalled resolve. DePalma brings the audience not only into the inner recesses of Montana's world, but also the reality of the world that he has built.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great movie my favorite,"This movie is very good and is really long. The basic plot is about Tony Montana who came into America from cuba. He wants more than a middle class job so he becomes,step by step a drug lord. This basically shows you how not to let greed take over.Although it is an excellent movie and has a great moral, the movie itself is really long and the whole time there is not 1 minute where the f word is not said.It is also very violent even though it has been 21 years since the film debuted. The film-making is excellent and very suspenseful at times. Sometimes people say the movie is overrated. I have to say that the movie does have extremely long parts with nothing in it except dialogue but thats what most movies are. Its just that in times during the movie the scenes are so intense that everything else seems boring. STICK WITH THE MOVIE.Its great if you actually listen and pay attention because the whole time they are building up to the end.It is the most fantastic ending I've seen but watch the movie.Its great.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Make way for the bad guy.,"Recently, Calais has been under siege from refugees/immigrants fleeing Eastern Europe/Africa, desperate to get into the UK via the Channel Tunnel. This put me in mind of the opening scenes of Brian De Palma's Scarface, in which thousands of Cuban refugees flood into Florida looking for US citizenship. Time for a re-watch, methinks (any excuse).Scarface stars Al Pacino as Cuban refugee Tony Montana who, having arrived in the US, does anything it takes to live the American dream. Working for a local crime boss, Tony gradually climbs the gangster ladder of success, accruing the wealth and power he desperately seeks, eventually becoming a major player in the cocaine smuggling business—but he makes more than a few enemies along the way.Scarface, by director Brian De Palma, is a dark fable of greed, corruption, violence and power, the moral of which is that, in the end, crime never really pays, the film culminating with a nihilistic finalé in which almost nobody lives happily ever after. Oscar winner Oliver Stone's script is far from subtle, a deliberate exercise in excess; De Palma directs accordingly, with grandiose visuals and OTT violence aplenty, while star Pacino delivers a suitably larger-than-life performance, making his brutal coke-snorting Cuban one of crime cinema's most unforgettable and enduring characters.The film also benefits from solid support from Michelle Pfeiffer as Montana's love interest Elvira, Robert Loggia as Montana's crime boss Frank Lopez, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's sister Gina (owner of Florida's biggest hairdo), plus a wonderfully atmospheric synth score from Giorgio Moroder.8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the greatest movies ever made,"This movie is without a doubt in my top 5 and in terms of brilliant film-making, is very close to mine and IMDb's #1 movie; The Godfather. Everyone should probably agree that it has one of the greatest acting ever witnessed in film history in Al Pacino's perfect portrayal of the ruthless Cuban crime boss Tony Montana. How it didn't win best acting Oscar could probably be explained by the fact that unfortunately Ben Kingsley near perfect and riveting portrayal of Mahatma Gandhi (also one of the best in cinematic history) happened to be in the same year. How it wasn't nominated for an Oscar is a mystery I guess we'll never solve. And regardless of unappreciative acts committed by the Academy in the past, this movie needs and must be in the IMDb Top 250. By my standards, Top 10, but I'll be happy to see it in the Top 250. Critics who didn't like this movie should realize that the violence and gore was used as a tool for effective storytelling, and to derive deep emotions out of the viewers, and not just to produce a gangster flick. This is one of those rare 3 hour movies that after you have finished watching, you say to yourself ""Whoa! that was 3 hours, it felt more like an hour"". In my opinion, this film is almost flawless in every aspect. Rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I'll elaborate in the review down below8/10I'm not really sure what to rate this one. To me it's between an 8 and a 9. I think the movie can be split into three parts. The first 55% are really good and so are the last 10% but I think the movie lost some of its momentum and flow during the 35% in the middle. Among the negatives I've written that the ""flow"" of the story during some parts wasn't to my liking and this is what I was referencing to. I tend to like a story that has a goal, where the story has a direction is heading somewhere and I think it loses that in the middle which takes the movie down a rating in my opinion. Other that i really like this movie. It is an epic, intense and exciting gangster classic that I found fun and interesting to watch and I'm sure you can dig deep into it and analyze a lot of the messages behind the movie. The setting of the movie is really cool, I like 80s Miami and it fits the story just like Al Pacino does who I think does really well in this role and really makes it his own.

Excessive,"Al Pacino is great and there is a certain Shakespearean arc to his character who comes to America and through ruthless ambition becomes a drug overlord only to find emptiness at the top, but it's a story that's just not for me. The excess and lack of nuance of an Oliver Stone screenplay combined with Brian De Palma's direction (oof, what a combination), the cheesy synthesizer soundtrack, and the anti-immigration undercurrent all leave me a little cold. Stereotypes and misogyny are served up in heavy portions here, amidst the memorable lines brimming with equal parts machismo and profanity. Aside from Pacino in brownface, there are also several others, like F. Murray Abraham, which is pretty damn unfortunate for 1983. If you want brutal violence and male fantasy, this is your film. Otherwise, brace yourself for 170 long minutes.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Montana, An American Idol","Scarface is an interesting movie. First of all, there is Al Pacino. It is possible to see that this movie is praised everywhere with his legendary acting. So what does this movie tell? Is it really legendary? Let's see together.Scarface is an American Dream movie in the simplest terms. Tony Montana is a man who has already escaped from communism and come to ""Free America"". And this movie is his. Just like the world is his, this movie belongs to Tony. This is a movie that belongs to no one else. The supporting characters are not important at all, not only to us but also to Tony. Tony is a very traditional man. He never holds back, he has a little ignorance and uses the courage that comes from this ignorance. No matter how big a person is, he does not look for a master and always stands out with his stubbornness. He can even rebel against his own employers when the time comes. He thinks he can handle everything himself, that he knows everything best. He thinks the whole world belongs to him. He thinks this is what he deserves. He sees that he is no different from strong and powerful people and sets off on this path. He is a criminal from Cuba and of course he gets thrown into the world of crime. He climbs the ladder very quickly thanks to his character. He becomes the biggest boss by crushing his bosses. Guess what happens next? It's not hard to guess. Tony is not someone who will stop because of his character. He is not someone who will say, ""I made a lot of money from drugs. I can launder all my money and deposit it in the bank and live a normal life."" If he were alive, he would try to buy banks, the police, enter politics, be the head of a terrorist group, etc. Because Tony's character requires it. He is never someone who will be satisfied with what he has. He always thinks he should have more and he also thinks he deserves it. So when will this man stop? Never. Maybe he will stop if he dies. Otherwise, he is not a man who will ever stop. Call him narcissistic, grandiose, delusional or whatever, Tony is that kind of a man. Although being the main character in the movie and some of the logical moves he makes make us like him a little, as the movie goes on, we all start to like him less because of the decisions he makes. He lures his best friend and kills him, wastes the woman he loves and many more. Because Tony is such a man. He has been like this since the very beginning. Tony is a man whose end we know. As soon as we meet him, we understand that his end will be like this because people who think like this are extremely smart and do not think long-term and so on. Tony is not an anti-hero, he is a direct bad guy. Although we witnessed his rise and liked some of his upright actions, Tony is actually the bad character of this movie when it comes to how he treats the people around him, not seeing them as anything but a stepping stone, not caring about them, being someone who can sacrifice everything for his own rise, being disloyal. If you ask who the good character is, you can find the answer if you think a little. I think this movie tells the ""American Dream"" very well. Tony is a pig, a tiger, whatever you call it. He has everything at some point, but how he does it is important. Because you can also see a person's fall from his rise. At the end of the day, Tony is crushed under a bigger rock than himself and his ""American Dream"" ends as predicted. Frankly, the movie dragged on and I wanted him to lose, and although I found the ending very sad on the one hand, I can say that I was satisfied on the other. Maybe that's what makes the movie good. It makes you love Tony at first. Then you distance yourself from love and see the ending he thinks he deserves.The America that the movie creates is great. I really liked the America scenes. I haven't been there even once, but I lived the American Dream in those scenes. Apart from that, the last scene was legendary. Tony's dishonorable scenes. Frank scene. The first drug dealing scene. They all provided the necessary tension. The cinematography is definitely above average. I also listened to the music. There are incredibly good pieces. The ones with lyrics really put you in the mood of the movies. Apart from that, although some pieces continue in variations, the soundtrack is generally quite good.Al Pacino is a really great actor. I don't like actors, but the guy's trips kill me. He plays very naturally, unfortunately, it's impossible to ignore. Especially when you see his roles in other movies, his range expands and you see how naturally he does everything. I didn't have the chance to watch the other actors much due to the theme of the movie.Scarface is a beautiful movie. Unfortunately, it is a bit misunderstood, especially by young men, but I think it gives a very strong theme and main idea. And I put aside this idea, the movie is also very strong in terms of art. I congratulate everyone who contributed, well done. If you like the Tony Montana character, I definitely recommend you to watch it again in order not to dislike it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Underwhelming cheesy wannabe greatness,"It's good to know what inspired the makers of Miami Vice series.
But, after watching this, maybe in this day and age of golden offerings in on demand cinema and series (TV is maybe not the right word for it)it was a big let down for me.
No twists, no deeper underlying currents of emotions. Just a plain straight story, following Tony Montana from rags to riches. What happens? Tony kills everybody around him.
I was bored now and then but had to watch it through, it scores an 8+ here, right!

Enjoyable but Flawed,"I finally saw this for the first time after years of hearing how good it was, and though it was certainly entertaining and very watchable, I came away thinking that it's a far from great film. Perhaps having already seen pretty much every other good gangster movie before having seen this one, I kept thinking that the Godfather, Goodfellas, Carlito's Way etc just blow it away... maybe if I'd seen Scarface before any of those, I'd think the opposite. But there are other reasons: More than any other gangster flick, it really is a film of its time, the 80s, which is great as far as it goes, but personally, I found a lot of it too staged and stylised - the scene where Tony goes to kill Frank and the cop coming to mind, it just seems overlong and ultimately disappointing; all you want is for him to go in and blow them away, but it's just really drawn out and then somehow when he does shoot them, it seems like a real anticlimax. I thought all the violent bits - which let's face it, are the main reason for watching a film like this - were all a bit of a let down.Then there's the music... OK, so either you like it or you don't. I personally thought it was awful, and really detracted from the film - and the lowest point is the truly dreadful song that plays over the sequence where they start taking bagloads of cash to the bank... not only is it possibly the worst song ever made, but it actually plays over shots of Scarface talking, in a way that makes it look like a deleted scene from Miami Vice. Whether or not this was an integral part of the film's style didn't matter to me - it just looked and sounded terrible.Finally, Scarface - both the man and the film - were ultimately too simple to be truly satisfying. As a character, he might have balls, as he's constantly reminding us, and his brashness is responsible for the good bits in the film, but overall, it's somehow a bit of a letdown after the manipulative cunning of a Michael Corleone. And as you watch the film, it's so utterly predictable what's going to happen. As soon as you seen Elvira for the first time, it's obvious that Tony will have to get rid of Frank at some point. When Manny mentions how nice Tony's sister is, it's obvious that his feelings for her will lead to his demise. And when Sosa tells Tony never to f*** him over, it's obvious that he will and that that's how the film will end.Having said all that, it's definitely worth watching, and has some great scenes in it; my personal favourite is when Sosa calls Tony a f***ing monkey over the phone, and Tony starts hurling obscenities back at him only to be told that he's hung up. And at the end when he shouts ""You think you can stop me with bullets?"" is somehow a hilarious but also very moving summation of his whole character.",5.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The best antihero in film,"Not only that but the director has complete control of what he wants to express. Excess, Critics, Power, Fake Liberty... Pretty much the American Dream. From an upper layers everyone is a puppet by the director's point of view, and you don't realize it until you finished the film.The bathtub scene, The Banker Scene, The world is yours(until it's not, cause it never was)Pan American®.The acting is on another level as well, it's so good you don't even notice Al Pacino's horrible Spanish.When it comes to the sound though..., it's pure aura, simple and minimalist, just perfect.I don't have enough writing skills to express what I see in my mind. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Underappreciated classic.,"Scarface is much more than just a crime movie, as a film with several layers. Scarface shows how every sacrifice made on the path to power and success leaves a huge void in the end. Thanks to Al Pacino's extraordinary performance, Scarface has become a masterpiece that has left its mark on cinema.Scarface explores the inner collapse of a character and the dark side of the American dream.Pacino portrays the greed, anger and ambition of the character so powerfully that the viewer cannot keep a certain distance from the film while watching him. Tony's emotional turmoil is perfectly matched with the film's harsh narrative. Pacino's unique dialogue delivery and aggressive attitude make him one of the most memorable characters in cinema.In the beginning of the film, Tony's only possessions in life are the faith and ambition he brought with him as an immigrant. After arriving in Miami, he quickly becomes a recognizable figure in that world. But Scarface shows his rise, but also the dangerous nature of the place he quickly arrives in. The price of Tony's success is greater danger and more hostility with each step. This causes him to fall into a terrifying decline. The American dream, which once symbolized freedom and power, eventually faces him with a devastating end.Scarface is also a harsh critique of American society's understanding of ""success"" and the corruption that comes with it. Tony's rise also reflects his emptiness and his attitude of seeing people as tools. The American dream, when viewed through Tony's eyes, is never actually based on helping or caring for others; it focuses only on individual success and the ultimate reward of ambition. From this perspective, Scarface is both a story of success and the destruction that accompanies it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Gangster violence to a whole new level,"In May 1980, Castro releases thousands of Cuban prisoners including Tony Montana (Al Pacino) from Mariel Harbor. His friend Manny Ribera (Steven Bauer) gets a contract to kill a political prisoner for green cards for both of them. They're soon working for drug dealer Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham) to double cross some Columbians. Tony takes advantage and becomes a hit-man for big boss Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia). He is after Lopez's girlfriend Elvira Hancock (Michelle Pfeiffer) and his whole empire. His mother (Miriam Colon) disapproves of his work and tries to separate him from his adoring sister Gina (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).Al Pacino gives one of the most memorable weird performance of the world. Director Brian De Palma brings an ultra-violent sense to the material. It brings almost joy to this violent villain character. It reminds me of the old WB gangster movies where violence rules. This pushes it to an even higher level. It's a new icon of the gangster movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Being A Gangster - It's Not All Glamor!,"I found this to be an interesting character study of a Cuban who comes to Miami and becomes a big drug dealer, rising from little to become a big-shot and wealthy....and then destroy himself. The movie got panned at the time of its release for its excesses in profanity and violence....but now since we've all become desensitized with decades of this stuff, the film is now almost reaching ""cult status."" Amazing. The critics, meanwhile, loved ""Casino,"" which - profanity- wise, made ""Scarface"" sound like ""Mary Poppins."" Go figure.Nonetheless, at the time, Al Pacino (""Tony Montana"") probably set a new Hollywood record for using the f-word in a mainline film. Pacino's wife, ""Elvira"" played by the beautiful Michelle Peiffer, wasn't a lot more wholesome than her husband. She got really brutal as the film wore on.If that language is no problem, you'll find the story quite interesting and a good study of how paranoia must wind up haunting most gangsters. It's a real downside to living the live of crime. Near the end, Pacino is going to bed each night with a gun under his pillow. That's not how you want to get a good night's sleep!Anyone who thinks being a big-time crook is ""the life,"" should watch this film and pay attention. It may look like ""crime pays,"" but it doesn't. I mention all this because this movie is perfect portrayal of how the paranoia of being in the drug business can do you in, as well as other problems that can do you in. It isn't all glamor.

I seen Scarface again a couple of times as I got older and it has not goten better, i just feel the same its any okay movie as i read from another review is if Al P was not in it it would have been forgoten years ago. So if you want to see a maffia crime movie with Al P watch ""Carlitos Way"".

"""Say hello to my little friend!""","Brian DePalma's epic drug flick 'Scarface' is quite an intriuging insight into the billion dollar drug trade in the US. With Pacino in the title role as Tony Montana (AKA Scarface), a Cuban refugee who hits the big time with the drug trade in Miami, who would've thought this flick wouldn't be something special. Montana is a cold blooded businessman.....which is what you have to be in the business he's in! DePalma's direction of Pacino is extremely entertaining, from his impressive Cuban accent to his strong body movements, DePalma has crafted his lead in a way that would put most mob bosses to shame. Although Oliver Stone's electric screenplay is somewhat overlong, it still does present some great scenes to be remembered. Pacino gives us a character who in spite of his small frame, exerts more power and finness than any other character in the film. His obsession with the word ""f**k"" presents some comedic results, when his wife (played by a young Michelle Pfeiffer) pleads ""Can you please stop saying 'f**k' all the time!"". The killings in Scarface are quite imaginative, and not just the common mafia style we're used to in other movies. Stone's scripted killings range from hanging one of Montana's supposed partners        (F. Murray Abraham) from a helicopter and chopping another one of Montana's partner's hand and leg off with a chainsaw to the cool-looking shooting guys in the forehead from point blank range and blowing guys up with grenade launchers. In spite of this apparent brutality, Stone does deliver each killing in a unique way.....proving that there are more ways to dispose of an unwanted individual. As Montana rises to the throne of the Miami drug business, he makes mortal enemies, who in a final bloody showdown in Montana's coke-smothered (and be warned, there is a s**t load of coke in this movie!) mansion, deliver his self-inflicted end. Scarface is a brutal story of a man who wanted it all, and got it too.....but was brought down because of it. Just remember ""Say hello to my little friend!"".",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"An Intense, Gripping Piece of Art","4 out of 5 Stars Contrary to popular opinion, there were a lot of good eighties films. This is one of the best. DePalma's three-hour-long epic about a Cuban outlaw who comes to the United States and becomes a fearsome drug kingpin is one of the most stark, haunting, and rich cinematic experiences of the decade. While not without flaws, it is a towering cinematic achievement, filled with vivid imagery, spectacular acting, and a raw intensity that was extremely rare then and was extremely rare now.The eighties are my least favorite decade in modern history, and a lot of its films reflect its worst qualities. They are trite, overblown, and senseless. They prefer artifice over truth, and often attempt to sell artifice as truth. If I didn't know better, I'd say they were made by robots that are trying to understand human emotions. Rampant commercialism and an inability to connect with their audience- or people in general- ruin many of these films. A lot of eighties films are lack a metallic plant: ""Oh, you liked this organic, lush sprout? Here, let us make one for you but take out all the lushness and organicness you liked about it. There. Aren't you happy?"" What the great eighties movies, whether they be dramatic or comedic, have in common is that they deal with the grandiosity of the decade. Back to the Future and Ferris Bueller's Day Off both ride that grandiosity for all it's worth. You feel like you're getting away with something when you watch them. It's fantastic. On the other hand, a film like Heathers goes right at the excess and insanity, providing something of an antidote to it. Then there is the third option: rip that grandiosity off the tracks and show its horrendous underbelly. That is what this film does.This a film that could only have been made in the eighties. Nowadays, filmmakers take a different approach to portraying the excess of the eighties- see The Wolf of Wall Street. But in this film, the tragedy of 80's excess is shown in that same level of 80's excess. While this could have played to the film's detriment, it ends up creating a deeper and more believable world. It plays better now than it does back then. The opulence Tony- our protagonist- surrounds himself in during the third act of the tale is more surreal and arcane than it was back then. A modern filmmaker can attempt to replicate the insanity, but it would be a conscious decision and thus would not flow as well into the fabric of the film.It helps that this film was made by two of the most fundamentally 80's filmmakers in existence: I already mentioned DePalma, but this film was written by Oliver Stone. Both men have of course made films outside the 80's, but they were at their best in the 80's, are distinctly remembered for the films they created in the eighties, and represented many of the highs and lows of the eighties.The action is strong, particularly in the famous final scene, and the acting is good, though not great. There are a few pacing problems, though I appreciate the film's scale. The character work is shoddy, but the narrative is well written. The cinematography, music, and style of the film are exemplary. The combination of shadows and long shots with bursts of violence evoked the image of a predator stalking their terrain.While not the greatest work in its genre, Scarface not only remains a tremendously influential film, but an intense, unsettling, thoroughly entertaining film. I duly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scarface - Vintage 80's at its best,"Al Pacino at his very best delivering classic ""Americana"" in virtually every way.I don't think think another actor could have pulled Tony Montana off so well. The casting director deserves a medal for choosing such a perfect supporting crew especially in regards to Michelle Pfiffer who really did an excellent job of portraying the bitchy,bored trophy wife caught in the middle of a perfect storm.I personally would love to see a remake of this movie, but the drug world has changed a lot since then with many movies covering the narco culture topic.

Brian De Palma's Near Masterpiece,"Overlooked among the cast of Brian DePalma's fevered 1983 film ""Scarface"" is an incredible five-minute appearance that should have won this actress the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. Little-known character actress Miriam Colon played Mama Montana (mother of Al Pacino's flamboyantly amoral Tony Montana) with such startling force that she wiped everyone else off the screen. Her silence is as calculated and heartbreaking as her ultimate tirade. Pacino is superb throughout.

Scarface reminds me of....,"Scarface (1983) Cast: Al Pacino as Tony Montana, F. Murray Abraham as Omar Suarez, Steven Bauer as Manny Ribera, Miriam Colon as Georgina Montana, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Gina Montana, Robert Loggia as Frank Lopez and Michelle Pfeiffer as Elvira Hancock.Director: Brian De Palma gives us an amazing action-thrilled, American dream-inspired movie to the big screen. Al Pacino is the main role in this adrenaline-filled film. Many 1970s and 80s Cuban cultural realms are debuted when crisis threatens Tony Montana, a dishwasher asylum resident of America seeking the American dream.When Tony Montana gets exported from Cuba to Florida because of being a Cuban Army hit-man, he receives his green card and seeks the American dream in Miami, Florida. Tony Montana is joined by Manny Ribiera (Tony Montana's former brother in law) and Gina Montana (Tony Montana's sister).This film served as great thrill with its continuity editing and fast kills and plot changes throughout the climax. De Palma used actors that could portray 'mean' and 'grungy' faces and accents such as Al Pacino and Steven Bauer; all of them executed respective roles. De Palma provided an inside scope to the Cuban lifestyle in urban sections of Miami, Florida. There is a cultural belief of an American dream that many drug dealers pursue in ethnic communities.The one actor that stood by Tony's side throughout his adventure to the 'top' was Manny Ribiera. After Tony seeks the world he so desired he realizes once he gets to the top that there is nothing there but loneliness. DePalmo uses an ideology of 'self' satisfaction to display negativity on selfishness and greed.At an astonishing amount of 170 minutes, the length of the movie was unique to consumer's and was detailed as a interesting characteristic of the film. This film is fairly long, there were a few times where the movie felt very action packed which gave it a very 'artificial' climax.Despite the constant amount of deaths, Scaface is intense, bloody, rich-- and real in portraying a glimpse of the roads to greed riches.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Say Goodnight to the Bad Guy...,"In Miami during the 1980's, Tony Montana (Al Pacino) takes himself from nothing to becoming the biggest drug lord in Florida. From women to money to power, Tony experiences everything could ever dream of and things he wished he hadn't.Being one of my most favorite films of all time, I decided that my 100th review should be Scarface.Tony Montana is perhaps one the greatest movie characters of all time, due to the amazing actor who played him (Al Pacino) and the incredible story behind him. Rising from nothing, Tony quickly finds himself on top of the world after taking his original partners job, woman, and life. Betrayal, revenge, and loyalty are all major themes to a film in which describes the criminal mind so brilliantly detailed, that the film had to be three hours long.Al Pacino is a god, when it comes to film. He played Michael Corleone in The Godfather trilogy and many other characters that made him famous. But no one will ever play a character such as Tony Montana like Al Pacino. Flawless is the only word to describe the greatness of his acting during this film. The writing was already good, but Pacino gave the writing meaning with his tone and facial expressions, helping create some of the most memorable movie quotes of all time in large quantity.""Say goodnight to the bad guy"" describes the movie exactly. Tony Montana plays a vicious but needed character in society. Brian De Palma left out no detail in the life of Tony Montana. From chainsaw bloodbaths to cocaine addictions to a gang war in his mansion, Scarface could easily be considered one of the greatest visual experiences ever. I'm not going to go on and on about every single thing that makes this movie amazing but I will leave you with a final summary. Overall, Scarface is flawless in almost every aspect of film and is an instant classic and cult favorite.I highly recommend this film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Dated Tropes to watch in 2024 and Unconvincing Characters.,"This movie is about Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant who starts as a goon and becomes a mob boss in the drug mafia. This movie covers the twists and turns as he rises. The successful plot line of every gangster movie.The movie has a good start as a typical gangster. The first hour of the movie goes well, but I have issues with the scenes where Tony adamantly (harassing) tries to get Elvira, who is the wife of his boss. Okay, I understand; Tony is a gangster. He doesn't have any moral values. But she pushes him away every single time he approaches. Then she marries him anyway. And she complains his ex-husband was a better man than Tony. What kind of writing it is? Her character arc was worse and more convenient according to the situation Tony was in. She pushes him away when he is a goon. She marries him when he becomes a mob boss. She complains and leaves him Tony's character needs to fall. There is no proper arc for her decision and action.The movie is too long. This movie doesn't need to be 3 hrs long. It can be shortened to less than 2 hrs. Most scenes were stretched unnecessarily. I felt sleepy while watching; it was boring due to the length. Many say it is a violent movie. I don't think it has that much of violence at all. The actors did overacting in some scenes. I have more to criticize this movie, but I am even bored sharing my thoughts on this.I understand it was a great gangster classic, even a benchmark back then.

1 word : Mind-blowing,"I finally watched this movie in 2020 and what a MASTERPIECE, it's one if the best movies ever made and i didn't expect less from the great Al Pacino, he definitely stole the show from the style to the accent, the unique charisma he has on sceen, the amazing dialogue delivery and the natural acting, he's truly a legend. Michelle was gorgeous and i felt like she was underused but she still nailed her part and owned every scene she appeared in. The story is kinda basic but the performances by the actors and the atmosphere of the movie is what make it interesting to watch. I will definitely re-watch this again",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scared For Life,"I can't really understand why Brian DePalma felt the need to do a remake of Howard Hawk's 1932 gangster masterpiece Scarface. The original is so good and tough, lean and stark, short and to the point. This laughable mess goes on for an unbearable three hours, and has as its centerpiece, it's anchor, its star, Al Pacino who is simply dreadful. What has happened to this once exciting actor who gave so many memorable performances in the early seventies. His downfall may have begun with this very film, and he has gone downhill ever since. All his recent roles & performances seem the same, they blend and melt into one. His performances have become lazy, fat and dishonest. At times it seems as if his performances are yelled at us, and this is usually mistaken as intense and powerful acting. When he tries to be subtle and quiet,he comes off as insincere and all method. He was fun in Dick Tracy, because he was playing a cartoon, and his overacting was exactly right for a comic strip. His performance was all make-up. His Oscar for the cheap & sentimental ""Scent Of A Woman"" was undeserved, but as Oscar saw it he was long overdue. So in Scarface we have Al playing gangster with a bad Cuban accent which comes off as a bad Mexican accent. DePalma & the screenwriter Oliver Stone have change the Italian criminals of the original to Cubans, and instead of booze we have coke, instead of the fine subtle Hawksian direction of the original we have De Palma's over the edge misdirection. To be sure DePalma has made some terrific original films. Carrie, Sisters, Dressed To Kill and The Untouchables immediately come to mind, but Scarface is not one of them. There is however one top notch DePalmian sequence and thats the chainsaw in the motel bathtub scene, but thats only a few minutes in a three hour flick. The violence and gratuitous cursing wears us out, and after awhile it all becomes meaningless and stupid. I envy Michelle Pfeiffer who in the film gets to walk out on this mess. Also in the cast is F. Murray Abraham, one year away from winning a best actor Oscar and oblivion, & Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio who in the flash of a snort goes from being a good sweet girl to a raging party girl,unconvincely I might add.  The film also looks ugly and the recently deceased John A Alonzo's cinematography is muddy and common. Not exactly a highpoint of American cinema.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Shakespearian-style tragedyif you're a chav (spoilers throughout),"No wonder chavs and the hip-hop community look up to Tony Montana. He has no style, no class and is a deluded, loudmouth knob. What a perfect role model for individuals who think that bad clothes, bad music and an early death are all wonderful things to aspire to.I don't think anyone can watch Scarface and objectively call it a great film. It's a loud, garish coked-up mess that takes three hours to show an ambitious Cuban immigrant get rich and then screw up and die (drugs are bad, mmkay?). That's all there is to the film. Tony Montana isn't Michael Corleone. He isn't a multi-faceted character. He's a cardboard cut out, albeit an enjoyable one. Now I'm sure chavs probably see Scarface as an emotional Shakespearian-style tragedy, but for me it's more of a comedy.Just take the near incestuous relationship between Tony and his sister. It's hilarious! When they first meet it's more like a reunion between lovers than a brother and a sister being reacquainted. They give each other lingering glances, they hug and horribly saccharine music plays in the background. Then, as the film progresses, Tony gets jealous whenever his grown-up sister gets any attention from other men. These moments are even funnier. The camera tightens on Tony's face, and apoplectic with rage, loud, piercing sirens of synthesised music play on the soundtrack to communicate his displeasure. He only has eyes for his afro-permed sister and woe betide any man who comes between him and that unsullied ass. Which leads me to the scene where he finds out that his best friend has been sleeping with his kin. He scrunches his face like he's messed himself and then he blows his friend away. Afterwards sad music, denoting the tragedy of the scene, floods the speakers, but I couldn't stop laughing. Nor could I when afro-perm tries to kill Tony and she gets blown away, and when Tony tearful tries talking to her dead corpse. I imagine if you're high on coke this might be tragic, but to anyone not under the influence of hard drugs it's bloody funny.Less amusing, and actually rather boring, is Tony's relationship with his wife (played by Michelle Pfeiffer). Has there ever been a duller screen romance? Or has there ever been a character so overwhelmingly dreary? I don't think so. Now I know that that's kind of the point. Pfeiffer is supposed to be playing an indolent junkie. But if anything she's too good at it. I nearly fell asleep every time she was on the screen. In fact, in one scene, she even said, ""I'm bored."" You're not the only one. No wonder Tony fancies his sister.Thankfully, though, there's the music to pick you up when the story is getting bogged down. Is it the worst score in film history? In parts: yes. But is it funny? Gut-achingly so. Now I have to say that the main title music and the main theme are pretty good  love that whip effect! But the songs; dear Lord! To think that De Palma actually had this dross commissioned  he didn't just pick bad songs; he had them made. The worst one has to be something called 'Dance Dance Dance'. It plays during the club scene where the clown gets mowed down by two hit men who are trying to kill Tony  they're worse shots than the A-Team. It's a travesty. But at least it, and the other terrible songs, make the club scenes so amusingly trashy  the bad clothes, perms and porn moustaches that the extras wear also help.But the best/worst use of music has to be in the 'Push it to the Limit' montage. It's a classic. Juxtaposed against this hilarious piece of 80s pop rock ('Walk along the razor's edge, don't look down, just keep your head, or you'll be finished') you have laughing drug dealers, Tony checking out his own sister as she tries on clothes for him, footage of Tony's tasteless new residence (it's like MTV's Cribs) and assorted moments from his wedding  the best being a tiger tied to a tree and the lingering glances between Tony's sister and Tony's best mate (by the way, in these moments, it looks like Tony's sister has streaks of dried snot hanging from her hair).However, this montage follows one of the movie's legitimately good scenes  the one where Tony has Frank killed and seizes power. It's brutal, it's calculating and it's very enjoyable. And I've always loved the moment where Tony sees the blimp with the message 'The World is Yours' streaking across it. It's pure cinema, and the music (for once) perfectly fits the visuals  it's also fitting that a man like Tony Montana would get his motto from a commercial. The chainsaw scene is also great. De Palma knows how do set-pieces. And of course the final shoot-out is magnificent fun  it almost banishes the bad scenes from my memory. But although there are good bits, there's too much dross in-between for me to take the film seriously. It's certainly nowhere near as good as Carlito's Way. Plus it annoys me that people idolise Tony Montana. Why? He's an idiot. And he's not even that ruthless. There's one scene where he refuses to detonate a bomb because it will kill a couple of children. What sort of villain is he? But of course, one of the reasons for this, is that he wants a kid but can't have one with Michelle Pfeiffer. So all the hard man wants is a baby? That's not very hip-hop. Nor is the way that being rich makes him miserable. So although Tony Montana might have a big pile of cocaine on his desk, and while he may have a big gun, he's really just a loudmouth, self-pitying, coked-up loser that wants to sex with his sister. Yep, he's a man to admire.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

A Masterpiece of Melodrama and Ultraviolence,"""Say hello to my little friend!"" These were the most famous words of Antonio 'Tony' Montana, a man who lived faster and harder than any other. He never backed down, never took anything from anyone, and broke every rule in the business. His ambition and his greed knew no bounds. Through cunning, ruthlessness, and sheer ballsiness, he shot straight to the top, and went out guns blazing. He got everything that was coming to him and more, but he destroyed everything he came into contact with, including himself. Scarface is his story, and it is magnificent.Al Pacino and director Brian DePalma have truly created one of the most arrogant, vulgar, irredeemable, mutha****s ever to appear on screen. Tony Montana is a man with no conscience, no morals, and no respect for anyone or anything. All that matters to him is what he wants, and how he can get it. He has one of the most explosive tempers I've seen since Raging Bull, and expresses himself mainly through the F-word. I lost count of his F-bombs somewhere after 100, and that was in the first 40 minutes. He's complete loose cannon, a guy who can't make peace or take orders.But watching his life unfold, revulsion gives way to pity. Yes, pity. Because even though achieves wealth and power beyond his dreams, he never finds happiness. Part of it is that he never allowed himself to be satisfied, never learned to enjoy what he had. His first boss, Frank Lopez, may have been a sleazy double-crossing jerk, but he knew a good thing when he found it. It didn't matter that his operation didn't extend beyond South Florida; he already had enough money that the hard part was finding ways to spend it. He lived the high life, and he loved it.But not Tony. No matter how much he had, it wasn't enough. There were new territories to conquer, new assets to acquire, and if he stopped to relax he'd fall behind. As far as he was concerned, the world and everything in were coming to him. But even when he had the millions, the mansion, and the biggest distribution system on the east coast, it still wasn't enough. ""Is this it?"" he asked his friend Manny, ""Is this what we worked so hard for?"" And deeper than that, Tony simply couldn't relate to or connect his fellow human beings. He had a trophy wife, family, and friends who'd been with him since he was a street hood in Cuba. But he drove away or turned on every one of them. Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer) was the love of his life, the woman he knew he had to have as his bride. But once he did there was nothing but bickering, short-lived passion, and cocaine. She'd have been better off if she'd stayed with Frank.And there's his sister Nina. He will do anything to protect her, to point of obsession. No man is good enough for his sister, and so no man will have her. And when he finds her with Manny, his oldest friend and trusted lieutenant, Tony shoots him without even a word. In one instant, with one bullet, he destroys the two most important relationships in his life. Really Tony only loved two things: himself, and the nose candy. Seeing him towards the end, he's like a violent, drug addicted Charles Foster Caine, except that guy died of natural causes.Not that this is meant as a cerebral biopic. Scarface is one of the most graphic films of the 80's. There are knifings, hangings, a brutal killing with a chainsaw- thankfully off screen- and shootings galore, including the final battle royal at Tony's mansion. This is one of the bloodiest, most powerful shootouts in the annals of cinema. The moments leading up to it are incredible enough, and then comes an absolutely stunning climax of blood and bullets that will completely blow you away. Terentino and Scorsese would be hard pressed to improve on these final moments. If you're even a bit squeamish, stay away. But if you have an extremely high tolerance for language and violence, then by all means see Scarface.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pretty much perfect,"Scarface' is just about as near as you can get to a perfect movie. It is also a remake. How many times have you heard those words put together?! I dare say not many. The original was made back in 1932 and I think it's fair to say that film-making techniques had progressed enough (along with the world around us!) to create an original and totally different spin on the story of an ambitious criminal slowly climbing the underworld's seedy ladder until he becomes the kingpin himself.You'll probably notice from any associated artwork for this film that it depicts Al Pacino, almost always on his own. That's because he plays the lead Tony 'Scarface' Montana - a South American immigrant who comes to Miami and sets about taking over the local drug trade. It's totally his film. Many say it's his equivalent of Robert DeNiro's 'Taxi Driver' as it would be almost nothing without him.It's also worth noting that he's possibly one of the most unlikable leads ever to grace the silver screen. He's a truly horrendous character with almost no redeemable traits - I suppose the only exceptions to his evil is that he only really hurts/kills those who are already involved in 'the business' or know what that sort of lifestyle is all about and he does his best not to hurt any innocent bystanders along the way. However, even his attempts to protect those he has some genuine feelings for (i.e. his family) often end up in disaster.I suppose it's worth mentioning about the protagonist's character as some may find it a little hard to watch a man like that for over two hours of screen time. If you're looking for a hero you can root for and even relate to then you probably won't find him here! I guess most view him like a human 'car crash' who you just can't help but watch in order to see how bad it (i.e. his life) can get. There are certainly some other familiar supporting cast-members, Michelle Pfeiffer being the most famous (or rather PRE-famous!), but, again, it's all Pacino's show. It really is a vehicle to show off his acting talent.
There's not an awful lot else to say about the film.If you're into your gritty crime/gangster films then you should probably own this one already. I suppose the only negative thing about it is its content. Due to its foul language, violence and drug abuse, it's probably not going to appeal to everyone (mainly those with a more 'sensitive' nature!), but it really is the pinnacle of cinematic gangster films made about a true anti-hero (of course 'Breaking Bad' later copied the idea - sort of - and made plenty of changes to create something completely different for the small screen, but the similarities are all there -keep an eye out for them!).",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Fascinating storytelling, not so fascinating lead performance","Brian De Palma's Scarface, a remake of the 1932 gangster classic by Howard Hawks, changes locations to Miami where Tony Montana (Al Pacino) arrives without much going for him. Soon, under circumstances at his disposal, gets to the reign of the gangster's world of 80's cocaine, soon having a sort of empire around him that soon becomes too much to control under the influence of snow.The elements that kept me interested the most while watching this film were Brian De Palma's direction and certain aspects of Oliver Stone's adaptation on Ben Hecht's material. The direction by De Palma (which owes a little credit to the cinematography by John A. Alonzo and the splendorous production design by Ferdinando Scarfiotti) is always at an edge and style to kept the audience hooked into where the story is going even if it seems inevitable in the sort of rise, seize, and fall saga of the money dream. Even though De Palma's presenting us with a more-often-than-not despicable character in Tony Montana, the techniques aren't tiresome or boring in the near 3-hour length of the film. It was by De Palma - and Stone's script, which delivers some good, tongue-in-cheek dialog, and tries to understand the scope of the characters in this world - that I stayed through till the end of this film. There were also a couple of surprises amid the conventions (i.e. the infamous ""Chainsaw"" scene).And yet, I was not one of those who thought that Pacino's performance was something incredible. I'm sure it's been influential in the twenty years since the film's been out there (the DVD did a whole tribute special by various rappers and real-life hoodlums), but from my perspective it served as something of a big liability. The supporting roles are alright, but his bravado, heavily-dramatic style seems like it COULD fit this revised version of Paul Muni's performance. BUT the accent and accentuations he uses from start to finish become distracting, and overtly comical, very quickly. And his booming persona is misused here; I can think of at least a dozen other performances where Pacino's been able to utilize his presence and style magnificently for the sake of a picture (The Godfather movies and his movies with Sidney Lumet are great examples, but so are some of his recent films like Insomnia or even the Devil's Advocate). This isn't one of them- here he confuses theatrical, operatic acting with ridiculous showmanship. What's even more interesting to me is that Pacino and De Palma's second collaboration- Carlito's Way- was a bit more mature in dealing with the conventions within the crime genre, and found that balance of forceful directing and acting.I do recommend Scarface and yet I don't recommend it as well. There were elements about the film that kept sturdy, even gripping (the last fifteen minutes or so is rather bloody though brilliantly filmed). However the film does have a number of flaws, and not just in Pacino's work (some scenes are a little too much for me, and I get a kick out of most crime films). 6.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The masterpiece that defines the 80's and the Gangster genre ...,"Did you say ""overrated""? Really? Are you serious? You mean ""Scarface"": the movie with zero Oscar nominations, and a Razzie nomination for Brian De Palma as worst director, the movie which many pseudo cinematic purists constantly denounce the ""all flash and no substance""-ness, its new popularity among gangsters rappers, Al Pacino's over-the-top performance, a laughable script and so on and so forth... you mean THIS movie is overrated??? Sorry man, but if one thing, this movie is absolutely and criminally underrated! And its iconic status, its place in IMDb Top 250, and tenth position in the American Film Institute's Top Ten Gangster films, are only the kind of justices that cinematic Gods have owed this masterpiece for a long time.Yes, ""Scarface"" is a masterpiece, because it precisely didn't try to be one and the result is not unintentional either: the writing, the direction, the acting, everything points out a deliberate will to create an entertaining gangster flick. But I'm not sure Oliver Stone, Brian De Palma and Al Pacino expected this movie to become one of the most revered, quoted and of course, emblematic of the gangster genre, yet it did. Why? One word: guts, the kind of guts that break the walls and rhyme with balls. This movie had it. It's made of the same vein of classic pre-Godfather gangster flicks such as ""Little Caesar"", ""The Public Enemy"" and of course, the original ""Scarface : the Shame of a Nation"", Hawks' classic to which this film is dedicated. Scarface has the virile magnetism and rebellious detachment of these films mixed with the exuberant flamboyance of the 80's. Not kitsch, not dated, the film couldn't have had a better setting, it's all about posing and showing off richness and power, it's a success story made during a time were it was indeed glorified.This is the thought-provoking 'guts' of ""Scarface"" and why the film deserves its comparison with its more mature and respected predecessor: ""The Godfather"". ""Scarface"" is to the 80's what Coppola's film was to the 70's: a reference, if not a milestone. It brought something new, assuming a dazzling celebration of the gangster world appeal without the preachy morality of the 30's or any attempt of glamorization. Every single character is depicted as an unredeemable scumbag and that was before ""Goodfellas"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". They're not totally unlikable or amoral either, they're just victim of their own vision of succeeding the easy way.Because ""Scarface"" literally pushes a certain idea of the American Dream to its bloodiest limit, to taste freedom and capitalism until getting an indigestion, to live the drunkenness of power until an ultimate hangover  so what did you expect the movie to be: a romantic Shakespeare tragedy à la ""Godfather"" or a realistic epic drama à la ""Goodfellas""? No! The approach was right, it had to be a gripping fantasy about the Gangster world. It was naturally bashed by the critics, but at least, it could exorcise all the violence, and whatever was appealing in the lives of gangsters, with an acid but so flamboyant portrayal of the American Dream, before the same subject would be handled by a more tormented and cerebral Scorsese. Using a Scarfacian metaphor, the film is like a great sex with a painful orgasm.How dare you blame the portrayal of Tony Montana, for being over the top? The guy is a thug suffering from a Napoleon Syndrome?! All he got in Cuba was an experience of being beeped by communism, which all naturally, encouraged him to change the position in the only country that could allow that, a country neighboring his homeland enough to be the object of a cult with a view of freedom, money and prosperity so idealistic it twisted his morality. Tony wanted the American Dream in an excessive way, because that's all the way he viewed America, as a fantasy, It had to be a fantasy from the eyes of an emigrant, an emigrant who dreamed of driving beautiful cars, having his mansion with his initials graved in his chair and of course  getting the blonde.He wanted the world, and everything in it. He wanted money and power. And now you blame him for being over the top? Would you blame Norma Desmond to be too theatrical? Or Jack Torrance to be too weird? Tony Montana is a caricature only to those who can't see how caricatured the way the image of USA could be reflected, and to those blind people, De Palma even conceded that the movie's portrayal of Cubans wasn't reflecting blah blah, as if we needed to know that  come on, over the top? It's a movie and a damn entertaining one, whose ""over-the-top""-ness is the extra depth the haters fail to see .And the script, is probably one of the most memorable elements of the films. It drops so many F bombs, it's almost a punctuation mark creating delightful situations where we see Tony interacting with his sidekick, Steven Bauer as the unforgettable Manny, or his soon-to-be ex-boss, with his friends and enemies, until facing some anger management issues  Many people said it was Pacino's downfall, I think this was his rebirth, the new Pacino in his 40's, and his greatest role after Michael Corleone. The proof of Pacino's incredible talent is his ability to portray a range of gangster from Mafia boss to thug, in such a natural way, I'm sure he's an unsung icon to many criminals in the world. The script is just a verbal ode to the violence portrayed in this film, a violence that will leave red stains in your TV screen until it dirties your nice pajama  a violence reminding that for every fortune criminally earned, there is a Damocles sword upon your head waiting for a fatal mistake.So call it violent, over-the-top, dated, flashy  I say, ""Yes, man'g!"" and this is precisely why ""Scarface"" is a masterpiece !",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tony Montana,"Brian De Palma directed this updated remake of the 1932 film with Paul Muni. Here, Al Pacino plays Cuban immigrant(and Castro political exile) Tony Montana, who arrives in America with his friend Manny(played by Steven Bauer) and immediately goes to work for the drug cartels, nearly getting murdered at first, but Tony is a determined survivor, and gradually works his way to the top of the Miami underworld, where, despite his wealth and beautiful wife Elvira(played by Michele Pfeifer) he finds himself bored and dissatisfied, though a betrayal of a rival crime boss and obsession with his younger sister Gina will prove to be his downfall... Though extremely violent and profane, not to mention long, this film is still a guilty pleasure, with a most entertainingly over-the-top performance by Pacino and energetic direction, plus a most glorious go-for-broke ending.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The movie that wasn't a movie...,"It is nice to see the likes of Oliver Stone, Brian DePalma, Al Pacino, and even Michelle Pfiefer make one monumental piece of cinematic garbage. It is nice to see people so rich and 'successful' wasting their time on one of the most forgettable, trite, and pathetic pieces of film-making of all time. This movie represents the worst of Hollywood.What is this? Is it based on a true story. Well, they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off USA today. But then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a 'cuban' refugee going to make it in the American drug subculture; kind of like Rocky on cocaine. Is it a movie about Cuba or Cubans? For the life of me I don't believe there is a single Cuban in this movie. The accents are totally fake, and scene with Antonio's mother looks like a poster for midwest American values. The whole scene looks like something out of the Dick Van Dyke show. Is this movie about Miami? It looks more like L.A. transposed in Florida. Afterall, a palm tree is a palm tree. Is this a romance novel. The relationship between Pacino and Pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo, and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other. Is this a drug movie? Well, no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned. The behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water. Admittedly, the acting is terrible.Let's get to the rest. The music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a Lawrence Welk show. I think I heard a polka? The camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective. Clearly, the photography budget was excessive. The sound is bleached in a number of spots, and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse. The writing is appalling. This is one of those movies were the script writes itself. You are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next, each pushing the plot like a sack of bricks.So I am going to ask, Is this even a movie? It could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours. But at least a drama series has some kind of focus. Maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together. Whatever it is, movie or not, it is a piece of crap.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""Her womb is so polluted she can't have any kids.""","Some people actually compare this and the 1932 version, which goes to show that human stupidity is both limitless and fascinating. Apples and oranges, almost.Pacino manages what no-one could have done with Tony Montana: he is both convincing as a real Latino gangster AND hilarious to watch. There are so many gems coming out of Montana's mouth, I really sometimes laughed so hard I thought I was watching a comedy. Of course, real gangsters often are funny in this sort of idiotic way, being the kind of mostly short-lived raw imbeciles with zero education and manners. However, Pacino never comes off as a clown. This ranks as one of the best performances ever.The reason this movie is head-and-shoulders above all of De Palma's idiotic thrillers is that: A) Palma does good mob films (see ""Carlito's Way"") and B) he did not write the script - thank God. Surprisingly enough, none other than Oliver Stoned wrote this wonderful piece. Apparently, Stoned's head was not clouded with cocaine, much like Tony Montana's, back in the late 70s and early 80s. (Unlike now: see ""Alexander"" and ""Nixon"".) The only criticisms I have is that some parts of the movie are visually unappealing, i.e. the photography is weak, and that those American truck-driver's rock songs cheapen the soundtrack greatly.Close to 3 hours of great fun.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Extraordinary performance from Al Pacino !!!!!,"Just watch it for Al Pacinos performance.One can wonder what such talented actors are capable of given a meaty role. Al Pacino dives deep into the character as Tony Montana the immigrant from Cuba who has been lured by the lifestyle of the riches, gets in the act of becoming rich on whatever the given choice of work, overcoming any kind of obstacle obstructing his vision. One can feel the humane side in him when he cares for his sister so much like a little doll, when he exhibits his uncomfortness and anger on knowing that he is going to bomb the car that has the targets wife and children and his respect for Maama. The scene where he yells at Manny warning him to stay away from his sister, his telephonic conversation with Sosa are some scenes where his powerful acting can be witnessed.As a whole , a great movie and one can only understand actors like Al Pacino and De Niro are definitely the inspirations and encyclopedic reference of acting for actors to come by for generations !!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Everything in the movie makes you feel like you are living in the 80s in the fast paced Miami (although the majority of the film was filmed at LA) and particularly thanks to the amazing soundtrack by the legendary Giorgio Moroder.

"An OK film but overblown, lacking characters and subtlety and with OTT performances to match","In 1980 the US opened its borders to Cuba to allow those with relatives in the USA to come over and join them. However Castro also takes the opportunity to clear out his jail and over 25000 people with criminal records come over. Among them are Antonio Montana and his friend Manolo, who do a killing for crime boss Frank Lopez in exchange for their green cards. When they carry out another job for Lopez, they are welcomed into the fold and they start to rise up the organisation. However Montana is ambitious and greedy and will not be content until he reaches the very top of the tree.This film seems to have been raised up over time to the point where it is mentioned in the same breath as such superb films as The Godfather and Goodfellas but I must admit, having just seen it for the third time, that I simply cannot see why people seem to hold this in such high regard. It is a good film let me say, but it is not anything more than that. The story charts the rise and fall of drug lord Tony Montana and it is a sweeping tale that always has something going on and thus avoids being dull  however it is far from being without flaws. Comparing this tale to the Godfather is a joke. Montana is not a complex character  he is a grubby little fellow who gets inflated on his own greed and is as violent as he needs to be. As a result the story is rather simple and totally relies on actions rather than characters  making the film overblown for the most part and totally lacking any sort of subtlety or patience. Like Tony himself, the film is all about excess and it gets a bit tiring as a result. The story is ambitious and quite enjoyable but it is no more than that. The film was criticised for being excessively violent when it was released but now it just looks about par for the course; however you can see that it is being deliberately overly violent at times just to make an impact and, sadly, it rarely carries an emotional punch  only a visceral one. This is not too much of a criticism because gore and violence is still impacting on it's own but I always prefer to be emotionally involved rather than just watching it for its own sake and, for all it's memorable lines, the finale is just a hoot  OTT and silly!The film may not have been written with any detail or interesting undercurrents but it does have plenty of memorable lines  which may be a big part of the reason that the film has been remembered for so long. Certainly it will not be remembered for it's well written characters! Montana is the main character and he is simply just a little coke head who is greedy  to compare him to Michael Corleone is a laugh, Montana has no complexity and no character and should not even be compared. Likewise in the supporting characters, there are no complex or even 3-D characters, they are all very simplistic and match the film's overblown nature. It is mostly for this reason that I consider the performances to be mostly poor. For some reason people hold this up as one of Pacino's best performances and I really wish I could understand where they are coming from. Because he has no character to work with Pacino has no choice but to just chew up the scenery. If you look up the word 'ham' in a dictionary you will not only find the description of 'meat from a pig' but you will find a reference to Pacino's performance in this film. He overacts without shame and is memorable for that reason, but to rank this as one of his best performances is just an insult to a great actor such as he  it doesn't compare to Godfather I & II or Dog Day Afternoon and, to me, it ranks as one of his most embarrassing moments of excess. The rest of the cast are just a collection of average 'cooooo-ban' performances albeit from quite a few well known names and faces  Loggia, Abraham, Shenar and Belzer all make appearances. Bauer is quite good but he has little to really work with. Pfeiffer has even less to do and is pretty wasted (literally!) in a minor role. Mastrantonio is a good actress but you wouldn't know it from this film  just like Pacino she is overblown and silly.Overall this is an OK film that is ambitious but ultimately is not worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence as things like the Godfathers of Goodfellas. It lacks any sort of complexity or subtlety and is just energetic and noisy rather than being well written. De Palma directs in the same style  every scene is overblown and sweeping, a characteristic that the performances copy to cause a talented bunch of actors to be presented with no characters to speak of and just resort to overacting and scenery chewing  something that Pacino is particularly guilty of.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Is an honorable drug lord who values the lives of children more virtuous than those who follow the law yet exploit others? The climax of Scarface resembles the apotheosis of violence witnessed in Taxi Driver. Beyond the superficialities, Taxi Driver and Scarface have much in common. Al Pacino's acting is excellent.

As one might expect with such a person, he gets into all sorts of bloody situations; in one scene, he and his friends commit what can only be described as the ""Florida Chainsaw Massacre"". Pretty much the whole movie shows Tony's violent escapades.I should warn you that this movie is not for the squeamish in any way, shape or form. But don't worry: the violence is not gratuitous. Overall, the movie was an interesting counterbalance to the 1980s' obsession with optimism.

If you're familiar with the 1932 film with Paul Muni then you know the story here is pretty similar with many of the same plot points but the screenplay by Oliver Stone goes for broke as if really tries to deliver something even if I don't know what. On one hand you have to wonder about some of the calls including the silly soundtrack and slow motion zooms whenever Montana is ""fixated"" on his sister. What about the scenes at the end where he pretty much plants his face in the cocaine and comes up with it on his nose like a clown? Is this meant to be taken seriously or are Stone and director Brian DePalma simply going over-the-top for some black humor? The violence in the film has become legendary over time with some outrageous gun fights and of course the infamous chainsaw sequence that kicks the film off and pretty much lets the viewer know that anything's going to be possible in this film. The film offers up a very strong supporting cast with Robert Loggia, Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Steven Bauer doing fine work. Of course, the film belongs to Pacino who goes absolutely insane here. I've read reviews stating this was his greatest performance and I've read reviews calling it some sort of self-parody. I think what makes the film so special is that it's both. As with the film being so over-the-top, so is the performance by Pacino. He's absolutely nails the character, the accent and the evilness of Tony but at the same time you have to wonder what decision was made to make him so crazy, over-the-top and wild. He's really like a wild animal and while I love watching the performance it's easy to see why so many would be turned off by it or question the wildness. As crazy as the performance is, I think the scene where Pacino addresses some ""good"" people in the restaurant sequence is among the best work of his career. SCARFACE is about as wild and crazy as you can get and while it's far from a masterpiece it's still a highly entertaining movie. There's certainly no moral code here and I'd question some of the decisions made but if you just want a long, wild and violent ride then they don't get much better than this.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Unintentionally hilarious,"This one is so bad, it's good. Great, actually. But I don't know what's funnier - the movie, or some people taking it seriously.First of all, there's the Cuban ""accent"" issue. This may not be obvious to American viewers, but Al Pacino's accent is so terrible here that he looks like a cartoon, like a parody of his ""bad guy"" persona. What's funny is that he thinks he's doing a great job. Even great actors, including Al Pacino, look ridiculous when they try unfamiliar accents (remember Richard Burton in ""Villain"" or Pacino again in ""Revolution""). There's no way in hell that's a great performance, unless you're deaf.The script doesn't help either. Saying a thousand time ""f*king f*ck"" is just ludicrous (no, it's not scary, shocking or compelling). Pacino's goofy mannerisms will make you laugh. It's intended to be over the top, yes, but that ""accent"" undermines his acting.This is a masterpiece of the ""unintentionally funny"" category, and for that reason only it is indeed enjoyable. Whoever wrote ""Scarface"" must be pretty low on brain cells. All the characters, including Scarface himself, are so unsympathetic that you can hardly wait to see them all wiped out. But that's not the problem here. The problem is of course the bad acting, the dim-witted dialogues, the tiresome violence that turns comical after a while. The ""so 80's"" soundtrack is a blast. Watch ""Scarface"" for a good laugh.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Greek tragedy in 1980's Miami,"SCARFACE (1983) Brian de Palma brings everything about the gangster saga and multiplies it to a point of excess in this intense, iconic picture about the rise and fall of a Cuban drug lord. Profanity, violence, and drugs are in full stock and the tightly plotted screen play by Oliver Stone unfolds beautifully. Al Pacino as Tony Montana is unforgettable, and as the film progresses he sinks deeper and deeper into tragedy until his whole world crumbles on top of him. Like most great crime films, this shows what the darker side of ambition can do to a person's life; the American Dream tainted and unholy. The climax in Scarface's mansion is masterful, also. The world was his oyster, and his conquest is our entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Good Film In Parts But One With Serious Flaws,"Some reviewers point out that when you remember a movie from several years ago your memory blocks out all the bad things leaving only good memories of it . I mainly disagree with this view point . With the exception of some DOCTOR WHO stories everything I remember , either good or bad , about a film or TV show from yesteryear seems to be confirmed when seeing it today . There are exceptions to this and one of them is SCARFACEI first saw this in the early 1990s and can vividly remember the performances , dialogue and gut wrenching violence . I saw it a second time a few days ago which did confirm that my memory of great performances and dialogue had been correct . However I`d seem to have forgotten all about serious flaws the film hasFirst is the rather annoying operatic feel of the movie , everything is grandiose and over the top . Every set is massive as the camera pans out showing us the sets . People don`t just take a line of cocaine , they fall face down in a massive mound of the drug . People don`t fall down after being killed , they almost explode in a sea of red stuff while the final climatic shoot out becomes laughably OTTThe second flaw is Tony Montana`s motivation . He cares about children deeply ( It`s this that leads to his downfall ) but nothing in Oliver Stone`s script explains why he`s so caring about little ones . It`s an obvious redemption plot . He cares . End . No explanation . It`s never really explained either why Tony wants to keep his sister away from all menAs I said SCARFACE does have some really good points . I never once thought I was watching Pacino act because Pacino IS Montana and all the other performances are good . Despite the flaws of the script the dialogue is highly quotable with lines like "" I bet you aint been f***ed all year "" and "" Say hello to my little friend "" . A shame the gut wrenching violence is too overblown to be credible or disturbing .A good film but I can`t help thinking at the end of the day CARLITO`S WAY is a much better movie",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
the great movie,"This is a great film with a unique director, story and acting of El Pacino ...

Over the top,"I had a lot of fun reading all the comments about this movie here on IMDb. It seems almost everyone agrees that this movie is a classic, almost to the point of being underrated (and a movie loved by everyone that is STILL underrated must be amazing!). I must say that i am of a different opinion. I would rather have to say that this is one of the most overrated movies of our time.The story of the Cuban immigrant going from having nothing to controlling the drug-trade in Miami, making millions and millions of dollars, is nothing spectacular. The same story has been made numerous times both before and after. This however is not necessarily anything negative. The story does have it's points. What i can't help feeling is that the story has been done so much better before. While there are many things separating ""The Godfather"" parts 1 and 2 from ""Scarface"", too many things to really compare them, the Godfather movies were still a so much better tale of an immigrants rise to criminal fame and riches.The main problem i have with ""Scarface"" however is that most of the time i don't even know if it's being serious or not. Simply because everything is so ridiculously over the top. Wardrobe, acting, music, cinematography and not least the dialog. It's all bordering on comedy, and sometimes quite blatantly stepping over that border. The most shining example is Al Pacino. A talented actor no doubt. But his accent here is... i can't even find the right word to describe it. It comes and goes through the whole movie, and his English is more broken in the finale than ever before in the movie (his English is WORSE in the end than it was when he first came to the US. ""Sayy helo to my liddle fren""?! And i don't even want to know what Michelle Pfeiffer did here, she was awful to say the least. It looks as though she felt completely out of place. And i can imagine that a frantic movie like this could make actors feel a bit strange.So this is an entertaining movie. But i'm entertained more by how bad it is than anything else. It brings out loads of laughter, but not from being smart or well-made, rather by being silly and overblown. Many lines of dialog are instant classics, but mostly because of the laughable way they are uttered. DePalma proves here more than anywhere that he is the king of ""style over substance"". I watch this, and i am entertained. But a classic it is not. I rate it 3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"The ""American Dream"" gone wrong, but done in a brilliant and unforgettable way","What a phenomenal movie. The opening sets the tone for the movie so well. The use of actual archival footage at the beginning along with the use of that groovy yet tragic impending doom electronic music just hits in an indescribable way. The storytelling and writing is immaculate. The movie flows so naturally and goes by so quick. Brian De Palma is brilliant at cinematography. The way he edits and moves the camera as if it has no boundaries, no limitations is impressive - almost like magic. The chainsaw scene is still brutal to this day, even though they don't show anything. But it's the lack of showing anything, leaving it up to imagination, that makes it much more brutal. It's crazy how much this movie directly inspired GTA: Vice City. There's inspirations all throughout the movie. That's hilarious and clever how the song's lyrics that are playing in the Babylon Club is a direct reference of what happened during the hotel scene. Top notch powerful performances all around. The whole aesthetic and look of the movie is very eye-catching. The movie also has a surprisingly good sense of dark humor.Scarface is undoubtedly a masterpiece. It is one of the best movies about the dangers of greed and power and it's done in one of the most unexpected and brilliant ways in cinema. What's so suspenseful about this movie is knowing when things are going to go wrong, but not knowing what's going to happen to the characters. The way Pacino builds up Tony's anger into an explosion is also suspenseful and amazing. It's crazy how the last 30 minutes of the movie everything goes downhill, it's almost like it turns into a nightmare. The ending will forever be iconic and unforgettable. We witness the downward spiral of a man who kept making the wrong decisions and a man who got too big for his britches. Tony is an example of the bad things that happen when you lose yourself in the process, when you forget who you are and where you came from. When you keep wanting more and having everything isn't enough - that's when you need to take a a step back and look at everything you have and all the people who helped you get there. It is the ultimate and quintessential look at the dark side of the ""American Dream"". Scarface is a must-watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Scareface Review,"If you like the Godfather trilogy, then you would love to see scarface! Director Brian De Palma does an amazing job translating the Oliver Stone novel of ""Scarface"". This is a true rags to riches story about a Cuban refugee that has landed in Miami, FL during the cocaine boom of the 1980's. The Cuban Refugee name, ""Tony Montana"" start off as a humble dishwasher, but soon gets involved in the cocaine business through a friend.Tony is the ruthless drug lord that we love to hate. Director De Palma does a fantastic job on glorifying the unsavory lifestyle that Tony lives and kind of has you routing for him by the end of the film. This is a well thought out, great depiction of somebody coming from nothing and evolving into a multimillionaire. This film has all the elements of a great film, it will make you laugh, cry, and jump out of your seat. If you are looking to truly be entertained by a film you will not be disappointed. I 100% advise you to watch this classic gangster film, it is truly one of the better films that has been made, and some would say that it actually made Award winning famous actor Al Pacino's career.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Entertaining  but not for the reasons intended,"This movie represents the beginning of Pacino's slide from important actor to self-parodizing caricature. If his performance was deliberately so awful because it was meant to be a metaphor for the way cocaine can destroy self-awareness and render one a manic self-absorbed fool, it would be justifiable but clearly that is not the intent of his performance (which must be distinguished from the Montana character). There can be no question that Pacino thinks he is giving a great performance.This is basically a comic book level effort except the acting and story is not as subtle as comic book characterizations.That said this movie is entertaining and one of the all-time classics of the ""unintentionally hilarious"" genre. That pretty much the same movie has been made hundreds of times on 3% of the budget and with .0001% of the pretension is besides the point.If you love bad movies with formulaic and unoriginal stories, sublimely awful dialogue mouthed by actors who equate histrionics with art and are punctuated with plenty of gratuitous blood and gore for shock value then you can hardly do better than this.

Sympathizing with the Bad Man,"This film has been endlessly parodied and quoted, and we have seen the repercussions in it in most all parts of our culture -- all for a reason... It is quite an epic, intriguing film focusing around an incredibly magnetic, motivated main character.In many ways one of the best portrayals of 'man against the world,' we sympathize with the political refugee from the beginning until the end, and begin to understand and see the world through his eyes. The genius of the film is that, in addition to being an action film, it does not seem to take on the necessity of most other action films of establishing the main character as an unquestionable hero, but rather it forces the audience to see themselves in and to sympathize with a gangster and a coke dealer. It demands of the audience to see things from another perspective, and to enter another man's world & reality, unlike your typical action film.This is one of the better epics put to film -- I would recommend this to anyone, in general, being quite a complete study of the human condition.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Not great,"I love gangster films and I love pacino in godfather but there is something really off about this.

The Unrelenting Ambition of Scarface: A Classic Tale of Power and Downfall,"Brian De Palma's Scarface is a gritty, electrifying journey into the dangerous world of organized crime, driven by the unyielding ambition of its antihero, Tony Montana. Al Pacino delivers an iconic performance, bringing to life a character who rises from humble beginnings to the heights of power, all the while consumed by greed and a hunger for control.The film's strength lies in its raw portrayal of ambition, excess, and moral decay. De Palma masterfully crafts a narrative filled with tension and violence, set against the backdrop of a vibrant, yet treacherous, Miami. The screenplay, written by Oliver Stone, is filled with unforgettable dialogue that encapsulates the essence of Tony's fierce personality and his increasingly destructive path.Visually striking, Scarface is not just a crime film; it's a cultural landmark, exploring the American Dream through the lens of ruthless ambition and the inevitable downfall that follows. It remains a touchstone in cinema, offering a searing commentary on power, identity, and the price of success. Uncompromising and unforgettable, Scarface continues to influence filmmakers and audiences alike.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

That's powerful cinematic stuff, and I can appreciate that. I guess my problem is in the execution; Pacino's cartoonish performance, the drawn-out narrative, the unbelievably overbearing score. It's got a good cast and the personnel behind the camera is accomplished, but subtlety and nuance are not its virtues.

An all time favourite,"This has been my all time favourite film since the very first time I've watched it. There is something truly special about it, something that not many films manage to deliver to its audiences.
Al Pacino is truly amazing in his role as the rising drug ""king"" Tony Montana. From his accent, his voice, his walk to his presence everything is amazing. Every scene he is in is nothing but flawless and this is mostly because he put his whole heart in this particular film and you could totally see it. Then, there is absolutely no one else who could have played Elvira, but Michelle Pfeiffer. She was perfect for this part in every aspect.
The film has the power to keep you ""glued"" to the screen from its start to its memorable and impeccable ending, a quality that not many films have.

This is the gangster film.,"""Scarface"" is an absolutely masterpiece;it's the only gangster film ever made that shows the real life of them (the gangsters).

The 1980s.,"I don't know if watching Scarface as someone who's no longer a teenager is quite the same as watching The Sopranos when you're no longer a teenager. That show is more explicit about mocking the characters and finding bleak humor in their inability to change or grow, but still to the point where some of it can go over your head if you're young. Scarface I don't think is as clever, subversive, or critical, but it's not entirely dissimilar. Tony is more of a loser in this movie than I remember, and I still respect Al Pacino's performance just as much, but in different ways. Maybe it has that critical slant The Sopranos does, but in a broader way (to cram it all into one movie), and, admittedly, with the sense that it is trying to be cool at times. The style and flashiness are what a lot of people latch onto, and maybe what leads to the movie as a whole getting glamorized and misinterpreted. There are annoying Scarface fans, and even while I'm typing these words, maybe I'm still one of them, no matter how many half-baked thoughts I put down. I guess it's complicated watching this and trying to reckon with still loving it, and knowing maybe I was someone who didn't fully get it before, even though it seems obvious now.But maybe all that doesn't matter too much, and it's not worth overthinking. Maybe a movie can be fun and loud and flashy while also condemning, in its own way, that same stuff that's fun and loud and flashy. This is a coked-up 1980s movie through and through (it's the ""most"" in a lot of ways), and maybe the kind of brazenly confident movie you get after throwing together a bunch of people like Brian De Palma, Oliver Stone, Al Pacino, and Giorgio Moroder is allowed to be a bit of a chaotic mess. Scarface is bombastic in a way I still can't help but love, and watching it just feels like eating every single item in an unnervingly good buffet.

The Godfather's Dimwitted Brother,"SCARFACE has... or had, since this post has been edited for a long time... returned to the theaters, mang. The one starring Al Pacino, written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma...And now can be viewed in all its glory, and flaws... As for the latter, and with the legacy of what's considered a ""timeless classic"" supposedly on par with the THE GODFATHER, who knew there were so many downsides? During one important scene, bordering the first and second act, when Al Pacino's Tony Montana, a Cuban refugee who climbs from poverty and starts making loads of cash in the cocaine business, visits his mother, he offers money to her and Tony's little sister. Mama refuses, saying the cash is dirty. At this point, not only does the dough seem clean as a whistle, and a damn nice gift, but we hardly experience Tony's initial climb from the slums to a car dealership where a forty thousand dollar Porsche is an easy purchase...Other than the terrifically gruesome bloody chainsaw in the bathroom sequence, taking us back to the exploitation drive-in 70's era, there's little suffering while Tony and his sidekick kick ass, revenge style... Our Cuban antihero goes from super poor to kind of wealthy to filthy rich in sporadic pockets, and we never fully experience the gritty innards of those pockets... The most important sections of the film seem to be missing... Although there are some amazingly shot moments, and intense rungs of the ladder of formidable success are shown, but much too quickly.In one scene with Tony and his best friend Manny, played by super-stud Steven Bauer, resembling a guy who would make the cut in a SEXY GANGSTER CALENDAR, there's a terrific ""hit"" within the makeshift Cuban immigrant camp beneath a freeway.Brian De Palma's long-shot direction is suspenseful and follows his established haunting style, and is, for Tony, really the last dirty deed unless you don't count a number of meetings with Robert Loggia's Frank Lopez, an over-friendly fella who, like what occurs in anything Noir-related, is way too trusting with his trophy wife; and then he puts the Cuban scoundrel quickly into the biz with too much power up front: like he's begging to be replaced, in every category.An important scene has Tony meeting in a lush nightclub office with the real head honcho in South America... Herein, an important heavy, Sosa, takes an instant liking to Montana's street savvy knowhow, having found his man, and vice versa. And the soon to be Oscar winning F. Murray Abraham, as Omar (the Johnny Ola of the film), becomes a middleman that's no longer needed. In fact, Montana connected so well with Sosa, even Loggia's Frank's days of reign are (predictably) numbered back home while his relationship with Michelle Pfeiffer's pouting princess Elvira is also doomed.Thus, scenes where a blunt Tony tries melting Elvira's cold heart provides some decent chemistry between the Cuban climber and the American trophy girl, but once they're married we only get random jacuzzi-side arguments that lead nowhere. Why melt a witchy heart just to drown in her tedious cauldron... Where's the passion? This after what feels like a music video with a horrendously dated 80's track (not even catchy or campy or even remembered) blares throughout: Viewing Tony's progression into wealth and power... but that's pretty much it. Imagine this wasted montage being taken apart and shown in actual scenes... two or three fleshed-out examples of Tony's reign as bloodthirsty mobster would have made SCARFACE more like THE GODFATHER... that was the intention, after all.Oliver Stone is a good scriptwriter, but he simply didn't have enough bloody fun here. From glossy 30's style nightclubs to murky backroom deals, De Palma sets an ominous moody atmosphere, and Pacino goes overboard with genuine gusto. And yet, sadly, Stone's story just isn't centered enough for the fickle mainline to back up the direction and performances. Both Pacino (and the other cast members) and De Palma deserved much better.Pfieffer's sullen bitch aside, the real ingénue is Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony's vulnerable little sister, who literally goes from girl-next-door to coke-snorting whore within two scenes with very little in-between, and her budding relationship with Tony's best pal Manny, who's been at his side throughout, results in a tragic, and unnecessary death...For Manny, in his own right, has more potential than Tony... Not only is his accent much more realistic-sounding, he remains a hungry climber after Tony gets perched in his golden palace of coke-riddled paranoia... All leading to that famous ""lil' friend"" ending, more like a frantic war film than an intriguing mobster flick. If only that spooky shades-wearing thug snuck in alone under the multi-camera security Tony set up to protect himself from outside adversaries. With so many soldiers running into the compound wielding machine guns, there's no suspense (and De Palma worships Hitchcock) in the otherwise iconic, gun-blazing finale: perhaps the long, ponderous scenes of dialogue were being made up for with a bombastic conclusion.If the movie provided enough slowburn, suspenseful action... like when Tony refuses to pull off a car-explosion hit to protect two children... SCARFACE would fit into the top shelf gangster canon. But from the bottom to the top of the world being Tony Manero's, it all felt too easy, somehow. So the problem isn't what's there, but what's left out.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

He works his way up in America, building his own American Dream.

Tony Montana! The World is Yours!,"Okay, so this movie is a classic and I don't think anyone will argue with me. Scarface, directed by Brian de Palma, is still considered by many to be the best Gangster/Drug film ever made. It is also probably Al Pacino's most famous role, and of course, it has one of the most famous film quotes ever: ""Say Hello to my Little Friend!""I don't know if you need me to explain what this movie is about, but just in case you haven't seen it, it is about a Cuban immigrant who arrives in Miami with big dreams. He starts at the bottom and works him up to be one of the most notorious Drug Dealers in Miami. Then it all goes into a downward spiral as he succumbs to greed which ultimately leads to his downfall.As mentioned above, and probably known by most, Al Pacino plays Tony Montana (Scarface). What can I say about the acting? Al Pacino is brilliant! One of the best (if not THE best) performances in film history. This movie made him what he is today.The movie also stars Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays Tony's Drug Addict wife. I am not a big fan of her, but she is okay, I guess. The rest of the cast is also okay, but your attention is mainly focused on the awesome performance by Mr. Pacino.Furthermore, the movie is also just plain genius. The screenplay is brilliantly written, by Oliver Stone actually and the directing couldn't be better, especially for a film made in the 80s. The music sucks ass, but it actually kinda fits in with the 80s, so at the same time it doesn't suck ass. Ha!In Conclusion: This movie is as violent as it is Awesome, super bloody and the body count almost as high as the number of 'f**ks' in the film, which I think is used at least 200 times. Glad Brian de Palma directed instead of A-hole Oliver Stone. I give at least 9 out of 10! This movie truly is a Cult Classic that will always be one of my favourites.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

De Palma has made a better gangster movie : Carlito's Way,"In 1983, Brian de Palma, with the help of Oliver Stone, delivered Scarface, one of the most iconic gangster/mafia movie. The scenario, which depicts the lightning rise and fall of a Cuban political refugee who became a drug lord in 80's Miami, is solid overall but the movie undeniably would have benefited from a tighter editing because certain passages are a bit long, and the more the story progresses the more this lack of rhythm is noticeable, in the last 30-40 minutes it evens seems nothing is going on. Pacino is perfect in his role but you have to like the style, he's not far from overacting as often happens, and his character is so antipathetic that it's hard to relate to him which is inevitably penalizing. The rest of the cast is anecdotal, just think of Michelle « trophy wife » Pfeiffer. Scarface represents for a lot of people the quintessence of gangster movies, while other productions such as Goodfellas or Carlito's Way, from the same Brian de Palma, did a much better job.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Pretty average rise-and-fall gangster pic that was unfairly savaged at the time.,"A Cuban immigrant with a suspect past comes to America as part of a general clean out (by Castro) of social and political troublemakers.Interesting that this movie seemed to get a lot of people (pro critics especially) reaching for their poison pens. Maybe the fact that this was a remake of a well regarded movie that got them reaching for the special ink bottle or maybe because it told a lot of truths about America's drug saturation at that point in history? Whatever the facts the movie seemed to be singled out for special treatment which was unfair. While this is not a great movie, it is quite entertaining and is believable in outline form - if not technical detail.(No killer would open up a machine gun in a night-club when then they could lie in wait outside, for example.)I have never taken cocaine and intend never to do so. It is - for me - the ultimate masturbation drug: Stick it up your nose and then march around feeling great about yourself for twenty minutes before reality starts poking its ugly nose in again after which you repeat the cycle. Al Pacino's past and past associations make him ideal for playing criminals because he knows them. I am not suggesting that he was one though. He is well placed for this lead  role - which I understand is his favourite film role.The problem with this piece is that it seems happy to play by TV series/movies rules. Make sure you sprinkle in a bit of sex/violence/shock every twenty minutes throughout the piece because otherwise the audience will switch off.While hardly new - or explored in depth - this does raise the paradox of the criminal world: You have to deal with fellow criminals, but they always want to take your place if you are higher up the food chain!This is a movie that comes pretty much as expected. Indeed if I was to have formed a checklist of content before seeing it I would have put a line throughout most of the list as the titles rolled. It is - however - pretty gory at times and there is a scene with a chain saw that must be one of the most unpleasant pieces of business I have ever seen. Truly revolting.Director De Palma always reminds me of the boxer who keeps getting world title fights and never quite becomes the champion. After a while you have to conclude it isn't all bad luck or bad timing - he just isn't good enough to go all the way!",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Awful,"I'm always prepared for a heavily-hyped movie to fail to live up to the hype, but I was astonished at how p***-poor SCARFACE was, from the grotesque performances of Pacino and Loggia to the gawd-awful script, to the pointless little ""hey-look-at-me!"" directorial flourishes (my favorite: the little pullback/zoom-in move DePalma does *for no reason* outside the Porsche showroom), to the ending scene, which is just stupid.It's movies like SCARFACE that make me wonder if critics and film buffs get together occasionally to play a practical joke on the rest of the world by pretending to like a bad movie, just to see if they can get everyone else to go along.Sorry if I seem bitter, but I feel like I've had three hours of my life stolen from me.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"What ""Scarface"" is Really ""About""","I loved ""Scarface"" when it first came out. I was 17 and it was the first time I went to see an R-rated movie solo. I'd loved DePalma's lurid previous films that I'd seen on cable. His new gangster film didn't interest me, looking to be another in a long line of staid, dreary, humorless ""Godfather""-esque movies (which he would actually do later, with the fine, if workman-like ""The Untouchables""). But it was a DePalma film, Giorgio Moroder was listed in the soundtrack and one night I was just in the right mood. I loved the film and saw it several times first-run, and have watched it a million times since.Years later I worked with someone who had been an LA gang member, and he told me he worshipped the film because it represented the American Dream, the story he'd tried to emulate himself, the rise of someone from the dirt to the highest heights.""And then the fall, where you realize 'Tony Montana' gained nothing, had nothing and was nothing...?"" I added, nervously. That part, my co-worker said, was beside the point. Montana had gone down in a ""blaze of glory,"" he said. ""If you say so,"" I said.""Scarface,"" the 80s update of the notorious censorship-pushing Howard Hughes film from the 30s, is a long, loud, over-bright, delirious essay in excess, the story of someone who does indeed rise from the mire of his unfortunate origins, attains as much material success as might be deemed humanly possible, thinking it's a worthy goal, and dies in a spray of bullets...screaming, fighting, spitting and cursing all the way. It wasn't what audiences of the day expected and so it wasn't successful at first; it found new life as a cult film over the years and influenced media and culture in surprising ways over time, including being the basis for a popular video game series.As a kid I marveled at the sight of cartoon people running around, unbound by any sense of morality, basically grown-up brats literally getting away with murder. I laughed frequently at Pacino's over-the-top performance, the trashy-yet-glitzy locales, the aerobics-on-coke soundtrack and of course all the ""red, red krovvy"" flowing--I was probably in the target audience for a movie like this, and from what I can tell young men trying to figure out how the world works fall under the film's spell regularly even today. But I knew at the time it was all silly and not to be taken seriously. If anything, it was a cautionary tale for someone like me, setting out in life. Michelle Pfeiffer's ""Elvira"" character puts it best when she states that our protagonists are not winners, they're losers. I didn't want to emulate them, I wanted to actually ""win"" in the face of what I saw as a series of bad choices made by the characters, choices that inevitably ended in their demise, the ultimate ""lose."" I enjoyed the film and left smiling because the protagonists all got what they deserved in the end for being such idiots; Montana doesn't go down in a blaze of glory, he ends in a pathetic pool of his own body fluids. Nothing he did in the course of the film amounted to anything that would last, his bravado proved petty and piteous in the face of his own mortality, his ridiculously engorged ""little friend"" final weapon, like the guns of most young men who wave them around fiercely with threats and animal cries, became a literal substitute for his genital/sexual shortcomings.DePalma knows all this and presents it quite obviously in terms of the campy tone of the film, which may have been why it failed initially; it's impossible for anyone who has a functioning brain to take any of the events of the film seriously and anyone who does take it seriously has literally missed the point of the film, which is that the world of gangsters presented in the wild swirl of 80s pastels on screen isn't something glorious, it's depressing in its cluelessness, laugh-inducing in its pointlessness. It's low-brow black comedy, not a ""credo"" for insecure teenagers overloaded with testosterone and looking for their path in life.Unfortunately it seems the message has been lost on most viewers who adore the film and ""gangster"" culture has gone mainstream...and it's likely the popularity of ""Scarface"" among the home-viewing crowd over the decades at least helped, and illiterate, chest-pounding thugs have replaced rational, creative, truly successful thinking persons as heroes in popular media. It's a shame, because, if you're really paying attention, at its heart ""Scarface""-turning 40 years old this year--is both a fun, cartoony romp and a mad morality tale that, for some of us anyway, works as sharp satire, reaffirming what we knew all along about what ""success"" really is. Hint: most of the characters in ""Scarface"" end up dead or permanently broken by the film's end; the actors who portrayed them went on to perform in other films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Brian De Palma's gripping modern gangster classic with Al Pacino's iconic powerhouse performance,"Brian DePalma's controversial blood-soaked gangster epic. About Tony Montana who was a small-time hood who emigrated from Cuba after Fidel Castro opened the port of Mariel Habor in 1980, he connects with Frank Lopez, superbly by the late character actor Robert Loggia, a local Miami crime boss, and guns his way to the top of the Miami underworld where he finds power and becomes the richest most feared drug kingpin in Florida. Al Pacino's incredibly vivid portrayal of the explosive Tony Montana, who's murderous temperament knows no restraint is one of his greatest most iconic performances. The acting in this motion picture is exceptional, it transcends the gruesome violence and the insane profanity that runs throughout it. The supporting cast is marvelous beginning with Steven Bauer as Manolo Ribera, Pacino's best friend and partner in crime, it is an auspicious acting debut that earned him a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a solid performance as Elvira, Lopez's cokehead mistress, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio gives a superlative performance as Pacino's sister Gina. Special kudos must go to the late character actor Paul Shenar, who delivers a truly compelling performance as the suave Colombian druglord Alejandro Sosa. But this is Pacino's picture all the way, and he is electrifying and dominates this entire film. Astute direction by Brian DePalma, with stunning cinematography by John A. Alonzo, the production design by Edward Richardson is spectacular. Giorgio Moroder's original synthesized score is superbly haunting.

The film makes a strong point against being a criminal, well you might cheat the system, but it will not accept you and you will not feel free, I guess it's a case when if you do an honest living, your soul is clean and you feel somewhat free...

Not so good,"This is a well executed, but nonetheless extremely overrated movie.  I do not see what warrants a status as a classic there.  Certainly, the later Carlito's Way is much better in many ways.  The characters are poorly developed and one dimensional.  The story is not interesting and as predictable as it gets.  I understand that some aspects of Scarface must have been somewhat groundbreaking at the time, but I still suspect that much of its success is due to the hyping of its violence.  The acting is so-so, and Pacino is miscast as an unsophisticated thug and refugee.  The only redeeming value of this movie is its classic, kitshy disco soundtrack.

What's worse: the film or Pacino?,"Having seen this over 20 years ago on cable, I recently decided to see if the ensuing decades could make me appreciate this, and the answer is ""NO"". I thought then, and think now, that the film overall and its lead performer were and are over-hyped to the point of hysteria. I even call into deep question Pacino's standing as one of America's ""great"" actors; for all those who love ""The Godfather"" series (I'm not one of them: I think they, too, were equally overdone), I suggest taking a gander at such ""classics"" as ""Author! Author!"" (ever wonder why he doesn't do more comedy? A quick glance at THIS will tell you why). In the hands of the unreliable De Palma - for every ""Carrie"", you get ""The Fury"" - a man who, despite his blatant desire and attempts to be Hitchcock reborn, is at heart a lover of the overblown cinematic image, Pacino is allowed to give his tiresome ticks and actor's tricks full display in a part that SHOULD have been played with subtlety. If the film is watchable - and it basically is NOT - it is due to the scenery-chewing; Pacino hardly starts with nibbling; no, instead he swallows each shot whole, inspiring his fellow actors to go overboard along with him. For each laugh one has at the actors' expense, however, one needn't be Cuban to be even slightly offended: SURELY the makers of this film could have found more than ONE honest-to-goodness Cuban (co-star Steven Bauer being it). The accents, particularly Pacino and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, are akin to those in the old ""Speedy Gonzalez"" cartoons - you almost expect poor old Juan Valdez to be trotted out, too, just for good measure. But how about the story-telling, the technical aspects? Well...once you get past the hammy performances - quite a struggle, believe me (you'll be tempted to bring out the cloves and pineapple) - and the assuredly overcooked direction, you are left with something that rambles on for nearly 3 hours, though with little reason beyond wanting to become a modern-day ""epic saga"" a la ""The Godfather"". As for the LOOK of the film, it's not an especially attractive one: the print on cable - no, I haven't seen the DVD and don't care to - STILL looks downright muddy at points, as if copied from an old slow-speed video tape, though this could be as much to do with pan-and-scan as anything else. The much-lauded score by Giorgio Moroder is, THERE: not memorable, as with ""Midnight Express"", but not a total failure and it DOES fit the cool, shiny-plastic beauty of Miami and its denizens as shown in this film (everyone seems to be dipped in either oil - the ""natural look"" apparently never made it down in Florida - or sweat, for Pacino never seems to stop perspiring, which is understandable, what with the effort it must have taken to overact AND speak with some marble-mouthed, faux-Latin accent). No matter, though, what the film looks like, or how it's written (poorly; example: Michelle Pfeiffer, sporting one of her other noses, just disappears towards the end), or how long it goes on (and on, and ON, AND ON...), people watch this for the acting, the violence, and the love of the ""f"" word (uttered 182 times), and they have dubbed this and ""The Godfather"" as ""classics"", all of which goes to show that if you say it long enough, some people believe it.",2.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Pacino is great, but the rest of the film is overrated","Oliver Stone has a habit of writing extremely controversial films that are either extremely well done (e.g. JFK) or extremely corny (e.g. Natural Born Killers). Scarface is one of those corny ones unfortunately, even though it seems hard to believe that this film could be mediocre considering it has one of the greatest directors ever at the helm (Brian De Palma), and one of the greatest actors of our generation gracing the main role (Al Pacino). Unfortunately, while Pacino's performance is one of the best (and maybe his most overacted)of his career, the film itself is filled with mediocre performances, a cheesy and linear storyline, and bland, one-dimensional characters that prevent this crime movie from being anything more than a popcorn action flick.Pacino does an amazing job throughout the film playing Tony Montana and truly stands out amongst all the mediocre acting and performances. While Steven Bauer does a decent job as his buddy Manny, Michelle Pfeiffer's character, Elvira, is atrocious. Not only is she a drugged up junkie that is the same character throughout the movie, but she doesn't say anything of significance throughout the movie other than cynical, sarcastic comebacks that make the audience think she is PMSing 24-7. Even her last line in the film is a corny and somewhat uninspired line that has the audience chuckling rather than sympathizing with her, which is just another example of Oliver Stone trying way too hard with his scripts. However, Al Pacino rescues all the mediocre performances with his emotional portrayal of Tony Montana. Throughout the movie, Pacino is passionate in his role, usually screaming everything at the top of his lungs or following anything he has to say with a curse word or two...or three. While at times Pacino does say some lines that have the audiences scratching their heads (which is not Pacino's fault but rather Oliver Stone's), Pacino's performance helps overcome those obscure lines and makes the audience yearn for more.The same can't be said of the story of Scarface however. Despite its great potential, the film' story falls flat on its face, lacking any real depth or any personality at all. Even though Stone and De Palma wanted to simplify the story and dialogue from the original 1932 classic (which was set in New York and about Al Capone), they simplified it too much and thus the story suffered because of it. With everything now simple and quite linear, making the story is easy to follow for the casual viewer; the film still lacks any punch other than the tremendous amount of violence. When the movie comes to a close, the audience feels deprived in a way, feeling as if the film had no purpose or any personality of its own. While De Palma and Stone did accomplish their goal of telling a simple story of an American gangster, they only did a mediocre job. For it is just that: a simply story of an American gangster and nothing else. That may have been fine back in 1932, but compared to other modern gangster films such as Godfather, Good Fellas and heck, even Pulp Fiction, there is nothing Scarface has to stand on its own two feet in comparison to those films.It's a shock to see that a wonderful and passionate actor such as Al Pacino have all his talents go to waste on such a mediocre film. While the movie itself isn't a total lost cause, it is just not a film that truly stands out on its own. Pacino's performance saves it from total doom, but without it, Scarface is nothing more than a cheesy story that could probably be used for a CBS Tuesday Night movie following CSI. However, while this all sounds negative, it is not a total waste and deserves to be seen at least once, just because of Pacino and the action. However, actually buying the mediocre film would be a challenge, especially when the only version on sale on DVD is an expensive two-disc Collector's set.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The World Is Yours!!,You Wanna Play Rough? Okay!Seriously! Al Pacino's greatest performance after The Godfather.,10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Still reeling,"It'll take some time to recover from being privileged enough to have accompanied Al Pacino through his fabled journey here...from his ill fated decision to give up his humble existence scratching out a living washing up, to rising to the dubious heights of Miami's darkest side through the 1980's drug fuelled excesses. This astonishing , visually gory, rollercoaster of a film challenges the idea of wealth and machismo to an extreme level, pushing Pacino's apparently endless, limitless and glorious acting abilities from one experience to another, as we witness with excruciating accuracy the demise of misplaced and ruthlessly executed ambition, whilst being under the all consuming influence of a steadily rising and utterly reckless drug addiction. Pacino's sunny and kind of innocent good looks and natural determination slowly diminish as the Miami sheen and tropical beaches corrupt and corrode his cheery survivalist instinct s as the whole film exposes with some savagery the underworld which Pacino's character Tony is initially tempted into, only superficially rules for a short time, before becoming it's slave again. The brilliance lies within Pacino's demonic performance, at times sublime, conveying brutally raw speeches to himself, his doomed confidants, to anyone, actually, who is caught in his mesmerising web of limitless ambition and apparently achievable aims. Even when he's in one of the most anguishing scenes, unable to stand, furious at his once awe inspiring wife, in a restaurant, he publically humiliates himself, his wife, his life, at the realisation that it's all gone to hell,. yet he still manages to jump back just in time for the last scenes, which are as inevitable as they are appalling, with Tony struggling to get his head out of a pile of cocaine whilst surrounded by the shot out remains of his decadent villa, black marble and gold pillars crumbling around blood stained bodies and carpets. He is defiant and scathing and full of bravado right til the end. The parts of the film that are the most telling are also the most moving, the return to his family, who know who he really is, his expensive suit offending his astute and frightened mother, who despises his lifestyle as much as his inability to be honest, from the almost funny refusal by the banks to refuse the funds Tony ends up supplying them with. The lack of technology here also, becomes one of the films best features, with no props needed for Pacino to shine. This hangs on machismo instincts working overtime, direct, brutal communication from one trusted man to another , with dark politics overhanging every conversation, deal and murder that occurs. Loyalty is everything for these men...the women here are symbolic, the mother, who loves her son but knows exactly where he's going to end up and almost can't bear to look, the wife, who becomes the passed on possession from one crook to a better crook, almost without her own voice as she follows the addicts route of almost total dependence into any hell scene , and the more challenging depiction of the sister, where we catch unnerving glimpses of almost Shakespearean , Hamlet style, tortuous , obsessive, possessive relationships, twisted from the biblical ideal and warped by addiction into something entirely on the other end of the spectrum. It's a cliche to say that this is a drugs gangsta film, but that's what it is, ultimately, but it's just that this one is probably one of the best for sheer clout. It's got it all...it's a showstopper. Just one of Pacino's jaw dropping scenes is full, packed to the hilt with every conceivable emotion, and much of this is from those eyes alone. Antihero he might well be, and much of this classic is hard to watch, but forgettable it certainly isn't. Tony's demise , his desire to succeed, and the outer ripples of corruption stemming from his inner circle of paranoid existence makes for a compelling, rightly iconic and legendary movie creation.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!,"Scarface is a 1983 crime film directed by Brian De Palma, and a remake of the 1932 film.Plot: Scarface tells the story of Cuban refugee Tony Montana (Al Pacino) who arrives in 1980s Miami with nothing and rises to become a powerful drug lord.Positives: As a fan of gangster crime films, I love how this film told the story of one character's origin to become a drug lord. The dialouges was excellent, as well as the script and writing. Al Pacino was amazing, and this is one of his best performances ever. I also love the violence and soundtrack in this film.Overall, this is one of the best gangster crime films ever made, right next to The Godfather films, Goodfellas, and The Irishman.

A perfect snapshot of the 80's in Miami,"The 1980's was a very special time in Miami. Scarface stands as a time capsule and a love letter to a vibrant pastel and neon time.The music in the movie is simply epic, and the Soundtrack for Scarface is one my playlists as one of my favourites.Alongside the music, you have the 80's clothes, 80's cars, and of course the 80's storyline of drug dealing, opulence and ultimately downfall.Al Pacino plays a master role in this movie, alongside some other terrific actors.Scarface and Miami Vice captured this era so, so perfectly. Almost as characatures of what Miami was like at the time, and the fact they came out within a couple of years of each other means they are very similar in theme and style.I'm so grateful they made Scarface when they did, at the actual time, as it would be almost impossible to recreate it now.If anyone has ever played Grabd Theft Auto Vice City, you'll probably be aware the game is almost a mish mash of Scarface and Miami Vice together. A lot of the missions are very familiar to those who have seen Scarface.If you were a child of the 70's growing up in the 80's, then Scarface is essential viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Crime doesn't pay.,"""Scarface"" is one of those films where I saw it, liked it, then kind of forgot about it a few months later. But after a friend recently gave me the film for my birthday (Hi Kari!) I can't believe I ever let a single frame of this pass from my memory.My problem with most movies involving orginized crime is that they seem kind of dry and/or monochromatic. Now don't get me wrong, I like a good drama as much as anyone else, but after a while, you see one gangland rubout and you've seen them all.Brian DePalma, in effect, gives the gangster movie a lobotomy, reducing this to it's simplest elements, and then amplifying them. In its three hour running time we have countless shootings (all bloody), a wonderful chainsaw murder, massive drug usage, non-stop profanities, and other trappings of wall to wall decadence. And who could forget the epic final shootout?Like most of DePalma's other films, one can sense the director's detachment from the material, as if the events depicted are so over the top in their presentation, that they seem to be taking place on another planet. I guess that's what I've always liked about his work.After viewing this film, which even with its 3-hour running time rushes by at top speed, one doesn't feel like they have watched an accurate depiction of organized crime, but a horror movie version of it instead.That's a compliment.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Most Entertaining Gangster Film Ever made,"There aren't many movies in the world that I have a better time watching than Scarface. It's hilarious, thrilling, and ridiculous to some extent but only in the best way possible. It's 80s ridiculous. And there aren't many things better than that. Although exaggerated, Scarface tells an extremely compelling story that doesn't let up throughout the film.Definitely an unpopular opinion, this is my favorite Al Pacino performance. While you can definitely argue that, you cannot argue that this is his funniest performance ever. He is extremely hilarious throughout the film, but also pulls off the serious moments when he needs to. And there are some really tense scenes in this film.The main criticism of this movie is mostly about its very over the top style of story telling. The truth? This film would not be the same if it wasn't. It tells its story impeccably. It's not how every movie should be made, but when done right is just incredible. This is not a crime film like The Godfather or Goodfellas. This is a film that focuses on Tony Montana's character and how he changes throughout his ""underdog"" like rise.I always try and give credit to the writers, especially when its a novel adapted film. Armitage Trail wrote this novel in 1929 at age 28, and tragically passed just a year later. Luckily for him, his work was immortalized with this incredible film.If you like crime movies, anti-heroes, and most importantly 80s films, this one is an absolute must see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Entertaining but biased,"Scarface contrary to some sources is not based on true events. To the best of my knowledge , I'm sure there are parallels to things that happen in the world of the Drug trade. This film is a remake of an older film by the same name. Starring the great Paul Muni. Reminiscent of the older film is the blimp bearing the writings "" The World is yours"" As a Cuban-American I take issued with the way we Cuban'Americans are portrayed.To begin with the script was written by Oliver Stone, a man who has made a living putting down those of us who oppose communism. Having the likes of Stone write the script was the equivalent of of having a white supremacist write a script on black history. He (Stone) has made it clear in interviews his thoughts on anti-Castro Cuban-Americans.The film of a Cuban refugee who arrives by way of Mariel, and became disillusioned with mundane work , and goes on to become a drug kingpin, was entertaining but was it. As a former Police Officer I know that much of what happened was totally fake. that isn't the way the drug trade , and police agencies operate. Most of it was pure artistic license.A ""battalion"" of hundreds of Bolivian hit men, just doesn't fly into Coral Gables Fl and proceeds to take an estate and it's occupants. Pure artistic license.

"Poorly Directed, Poorly Written, Miserable Soundtrack","One of the most overrated films of all time, Scarface is simply a ""hot mess"".The film throws cliché after cliché at the audience, with frequent awkward over-acting moments - Responsibility for all this falls squarely on the Director...after ricocheting off the Screenwriter's desk.Before Oliver Stone tackled the rewrite of the originally written 1932 script, he famously moved to Paris to quit his cocaine habit.Before Brian DePalma was brought aboard to direct, Sidney Lumet was hired as the Director, inducing Stone to come in to handle screenwriting duties. However, when Lumet read Stone's work, he quit.De Palma's Untouchables was his best film - this is his worst film. The only similarity between the two films is the soundtrack - occasionally annoying in the Untouchables, it drones through Scarface, adding to one's misery in trying to endure the film. Perhaps an attempt to fill in those frequent awkward scenes.The script fails on every level - Oliver Stone's Wall Street released 4 years later is a work of genius - Scarface a work of an amateur. I know high school writers who can put out better work.Add in fake looking bright red blood, and actors getting shot who fall/die like B Movie actors in the 1950s, and you have a complete mess.Not wasting anymore time on this review - Scarface is an all-time Turkey/Bomb.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Pretty Good..!,"Scarface is not a bad movie but compared to the gangster films from 1970-1995, it's only mediocre. Al Pacino, of course, was the best part of the movie. The premise is very interesting, at least enough for me to watch all three hours of the film. This movie has over-the-top violence.I know a lot of people like Scarface, but I wasn't blown away by it. It's a pretty standard rise-to-power story that's excessive in everything it does. From the acting to the violence to the language to the drug use to the sound to the runtime, everything's over-the-top. I get that excess is the point, but it's just unpleasant to watch at times.

An Iconic Tale of Ambition and Excess,"Brian De Palma's Scarface (1983) is a bold and unforgettable crime epic that chronicles the meteoric rise and fall of Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant who claws his way to the top of Miami's drug trade. With its larger-than-life characters, explosive action, and unflinching depiction of ambition's darker side, Scarface has earned its place as a cultural touchstone.Al Pacino delivers a career-defining performance as Tony Montana. His portrayal is magnetic, embodying Tony's relentless ambition, fiery temper, and descent into paranoia with a raw intensity that makes him both repulsive and captivating. Pacino's towering performance anchors the film, turning Tony into an unforgettable figure of hubris and self-destruction.Oliver Stone's screenplay is sharp and uncompromising, weaving themes of greed, power, and the corrupting influence of the American Dream. The film's dialogue is razor-sharp, with many lines becoming iconic over the years. De Palma's direction amplifies the drama with bold visuals and a knack for crafting tension-filled sequences, from violent shootouts to moments of quiet menace.Giorgio Moroder's synth-driven score is another standout element, perfectly capturing the film's 1980s setting and adding to its hypnotic atmosphere. The excess and decadence of Tony's world are vividly brought to life, making his eventual downfall all the more impactful.Though criticized at the time for its graphic violence and bombastic tone, Scarface has since become a cinematic landmark. It's a cautionary tale, a celebration of style, and an unforgettable character study rolled into one. A must-watch for fans of crime dramas and classic cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The soundtrack is all 80s!

Awesome!!!,One of the BEST movies ever made! Briliant actor perforamance and cast.,,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Nice,"Stone, Pacino, and De Palma must really think that ""Money is not everything"" is an original and profound message ... Scarface is often remembered as one of the essential gangster films. Although The Godfather saga is the most revered of its kind, this one is the film whose phrases and scenes are the dream of any young adult with limited knowledge of cinema. But after about 30 years, the feature that took so long to be cool ironically now looks just like any action movie from the 80s, with well-done shooting scenes. Only. Besides, it is just that show of endless indulgence that marked his time, with a lot of style and little substance. Scarface was the game changer for many careers. For Al Pacino, his performance here can be seen as the beginning of his over-the-top climb, which slowly but surely started to erode his technique, turning him into nothing more than a caricature of himself, an exaggerated and less inspired by the great actor that was once. For Oliver Stone, it was the film that revealed it, having released a string of successes a few years later, giving him some Oscars. And for Brian De Palma, it marks the point where his love of visual extravagance began to dominate his sense of narrative discipline. His later works would, at the very least, be irregular. In remaking the 1932 classic directed by the iconic Howard Hawks, Stone and De Palma change the scene from Chicago to Florida and change the central crime, from alcohol smuggling to cocaine trafficking. The original was inspired by real-life gangster Al Capone, who would have liked the film so much that he had several copies ordered. While the two films feature a character who rises to the top getting rid of his former bosses, this version adds the twist of having a foreign protagonist. By making Tony Montana a Cuban immigrant, the filmmakers tried to make some kind of satire from the American dream, but everything is done in an obvious and too cliché way. We can't care about the plot or the main character, as his personal arc is poorly presented and developed, besides sounding manipulative, as if Montana ""cares"" for his mother and sister to erase the fact him being a murderous drug dealer. And the ending is particularly cynical, as it tries to make us sympathize with him for the fact that he was unable to kill a woman and a child ... Well, then all the other hundreds of people who had their lives destroyed by the drugs he trafficked do not matter huh? It is a film that lacks empathetic figures and originality. In fact, Scarface is a film that seems much more interested in showing bloodbaths in the best way than building a minimally interesting social commentary, or presenting scenes with wider repercussions and meanings. No one can deny De Palma's brilliance in terms of set design and choreography, but once you stop admiring a particular scene or deliciously caricature and ridiculous construction of Montana de Pacino, there's not much else to justify the length of the film. In short, it is a film as deep as a teaspoon. Scarface for may seem like a luxurious and excessive film, but the truth is that it has nothing to say other than the old sermon ""Crime does not pay"". The problem is that it takes us a long time to know who Tony really is, and when we do, we don't like it. Here, all the boxes of a cliché criminal tale are checked: Fast rise? Checked. Dazzling and ostentatious with money? Checked. What of the pedestal for ambition and arrogance? Checked. If the script had been less predictable and the final 20 minutes had been better directed, this could have been an excellent criminal drama. You can argue that this is the film that directly influenced Tarantino at the beginning of his career, but poor is the work that survives only from what was made of it and not from what it did. Scarface is a bloated and indulgent epic that leaves you delighted, confused, and exhausted at the same time. To appreciate it, it is necessary to suspend a great deal of critical thinking, to treat it as a sensory experience, and not as an intellectual challenge. Despite all its flaws and excesses, it is still a good choice for an uncompromised session with friends.Film seen on the 24th to the 25th of February 2021.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"A Major Missed Opportunity, the Second Time Around","With well over a thousand other reviews in line ahead of this one, I'm quite sure almost no one will ever see it. (Or care if they do.) I just need to get it off my mind.The film is artless and has no redeeming virtues save as a very amateurish attempt to display what Ollie Stone saw as a bitter young man's descent into compensatory narcissistic and sociopathic hell. (One could say precisely the same thing about the 1932 Warner Brothers version, as well, save for its revelation of ""Ma's"" awful enabling.)De Palma's direction wouldn't have gotten him a renewal after a first season, free TV crime drama. Lighting serves mood. But the lighting here serves nothing. Music serves mood (as Scorcese and Coppola =well= understood). But the music here serves nothing.The characters are cardboard cutouts of what Ollie imagined Miami thugs to be, with no more depth to them than Cash's & Epps's in Warren Beatty's later cinematic comic book, ""Dick Tracy."" Which is surprising, considering what Stone had to go on after several seasons of Michael Mann's =far= superior (but still insufficient) ""Miami Vice"" TV show.If Luis Valdez or Edward James Olmos had written and directed SF on the heels of their terrific ""Zoot Suit"" (not to mention ""American Me""), chances seem far better that SF would have been a lot closer to ""real.""I grew up in a transitional neighborhood around kids who turned into The Real Deal in LA's White Fence, Avenues, Temple Street and MS 13 gangs.

Perfect gangster film capturing 1983.,"This is one of the greatest remakes ever made, and one of the best gangster flicks ever produced. A lot of people act ""too coo"" for this movie or think it's beneath them, why? I don't know. It rocks. If you claim to love gangster films and don't like this movie, then you must hate the 80s or Miami... something. I dunno. It captures early 80s Miami in a way that we now, time and time again try to emulate in other stories. This is a LEGENDARY film.DePalma knocks this thing out of the park in my opinion. It's a long movie, but it doesn't feel long at all. It's perfectly paced. Every scene is perfectly mapped out and the cinematography is incredible. The synthy original score is AMAZING, PERFECT and incredibly satisfying. The pop songs of the era are perfectly placed... The montage to ""Take it to the Limit"" is my favorite montages of all time... right up there with Rocky. I loved how when this film was on VHS, the second tape began with the montage.Al Pacino. Wow. Okay, normally I'm not into a white guy playing a different ethnicity... but let's face it. He's so damn good man. He looks the damn part and his accent is so amazing and good it cracks me up, because the transformation is incredible... at least to me it is. Can you imagine anyone else in this role? I sure as hell can't. It's my favorite Al Pacino performance, hands down. And this guy has acted in some of the best films ever made. Let's face it, this performance is so intense and fantastic that people literally grow up quoting his dialogue without even having seen the film or knowing where it's from.I hate to get a little political here, but I find it really sad that a film like this could never be made today in 2021. Hollywood would find a way to muck it all up, afraid they'd be stepping on too many toes. And they would be stepping on toes, and I completely understand people cringing while being offended... but a movie is a movie, and Scarface from 1983 is SOLID entertainment for anyone that's a fan of the gangster genre. Look past it's lack of political correctness and just let the film take you on the ride. Throw your hands up and take the dive. Honestly, if you're a politically correct person, why the hell are you watching a brutal gangster film like Scarface anyway? Can you imagine a politically correct gangster film? Has it ever been done, and if so, has it been done well? Doubt it. Just the thought of that... yikes. If you're too dense to censor yourself from films like this, do us all a favor and stop trying to censor it for people that are able to handle it. I'm a pretty left wing guy, but this a story, not a way to live your life...One thing that really bugs me about this movie though is the huge part of its fan base that holds Tony as a false idol. I mean, come on, Tony Montana is NOT a role model. Duh! This is a cautionary tale, not model on how to live your life... and if you are aspiring to be like Tony Montana then I'm sorry, you're a fool and probably bordering on psychopathy or a greedy and warped sense of the American dream. Get with the program.Okay, now that's out of the way. I'll just leave you all with this. Go see this movie. I hope you enjoy it. If it offends you, maybe go watch some Netflix or something.

Scarface,"After watching the 1983 film Scarface, Al Pacino plays a man by the name of Tony Motanna and his close friend Manny Ray flees to the United States on boat in Cuba to reunite with their families. Once they arrive in the United States, they Manny and Montanna began working for different jobs but didn't see anything positive coming from working. Montanna and Manny meet a kingpin by the name of Frank Lopez. Together Tony Montana and Manny Ray build a drug empire in Miami. When Montana and Ray have a difficult time trying to make a positive living, they both resort to selling cocaine worldwide. Once Montanna begins making a lot of money his ego gets in the way. Montanna ends up taking the Kingpins suppler as his own. Montanna begins making a lot of money without the man who put him on with making a lot of money. This upset the Kingpin. Tony Montanna gets a big ego from all the money his is making and doesn't realize that one day all things will come to an end. A lot of people are harmed or killed in this film due to the dealings with cocaine. There is a scene at the end of the film, when the Kingpin sends some men to Montannas home to kill him. During the endings scenes the camera focuses on objects and sounds that are in the background Montanna hears like some unexspected company has entered his home. Dangerous men enter his home and you can hear the sound of gun shots going on from downstairs. Montanna then becomes frantic and the camera show a large amount of cocaine that is sitting on top of Montanna's desk. You can feel the nervousness that Montanna was feeling when some bad people enters his home to kill him. Montanna snort s a large amount of cocaine, and that is when the film gives the audience the feeling that something bad is going to happen. Since Montanna snorts a large amount of cocaine, you can tell it gave him the power to feel untouchable. Montanna kills a few of the Kingpins men but there are too many of them for Montanna to take on by himself. Montana has one phrase line he says as he begans shooting his gun. That is, ""Say Hello to my little friend!"" That is when shots began to fire from Montanas gun and you will hear the gun shots from the bad men getting closer to Montana.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

I found myself not the least bit curious about what they would do next or what might happen to them.If there had been even one person of interest, and I don't mean good or nice person, I mean an interesting person, I could have stayed with it. Watch ""State of Grace"" to see what I mean. In that film the Gary Oldman character is a complete lunatic, but he is *very* interesting. Al Pacino perhaps did a good job in Scarface, but his character just did not engage me.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Oliver stone's heavy handed script directed questionably somewhat by Brian depalma,"Film was too heavy and for some reason not a success upon its release. But like Blade Runner, it slowly gained a massive cult status and aged like fine wine, finding its place in cinema history. Written by Oliver Stone (who partook in 'method writing' & directed by Brian DePalma, this violent and daring film is a relentless masterpiece, a study in rags to riches, criminality and narcissism to the extreme. Al Pacino is absorbed in this character that we forget its Pacino (the only other actors to do this that comes to mind were Robert DeNiro in Raging Bull and Robert Duvall in Apocalypse Now). This movie is so early 80s in terms of its look and production design/sets that Miami becomes a character unto itself, just as cocaine the monetary driver in this movie does. The movie plays out like a dream...the events unfold in a surrealistic way, things get more disturbing and chaotic and ruthless as it goes on. The main character and his co-hort are confronted with so many challenges and their daring sacrificial attempts at making it rich at the expense of anything/anyhow/anywhere is sonewhat cool and amusing, all in a disturbing way. The music score is novelty yet epic, and it's no wonder that the rap music culture took heart to this movie due to its romance with violence and brutality and the flexing of money. This isn't for everyone but worth a look- it's one of DePalma's finest commercial films and kudos go to Universal's executives who saw fit to invest in producing this film because it makes sense and gets better with every year that passes. The 4k bluray looks amazing. Technology is so good these days that the amount of film grain seems to be easily controlled. For an old film, this digital transfer makes this film look like its shot in the early 2000s. The hdr contrast and colors are punchy and vibrant and for the first time since its theatrical release, we finally get to see this film as it was intended to be seen in all its miami razorblade glory.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Not exactly a masterpiece, no matter what you read in ""The Source.""","Brian DePalma's ""Scarface"" is entertaining, exciting, intense, sometimes very intelligent, and often carried by Al Pacino's captivating lead performance. However, it doesn't live up to the ""Greatest Film in Cinema History"" title that the hip-hop community has bestowed upon it. There are some scenes that look positively cartoonish when compared to some of Scorsese's gangster epics. The cinematography, set design, costumes, and music are all lively and colorful, but sometimes make the whole story seem trapped in cheesy 80s excess. Ten years later, Pacino and DePalma reunited for ""Carlito's Way"", and that film was, in my opinion, even better than ""Scarface."" Sophisticated and genuinely emotional, and not a bit over-rated.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"""  Want to play rough?  . . . then  say  hello  to  my  little  friend ""","Growing up I had many a favorite movie. One of them was the 1932 drama entitled 'scarface' with Paul Muni. I enjoyed it so much, I saw it twenty-two times. It was incredible. However, went I visited the theater to see this updated version, also called ""Scarface"" this time with Al Pacino, I was astonished and completely stunned by this remake. I should not have been surprised at it's electrifying performances because Brian De Palma stacked it with star power. In this explosive story we are given a young and utterly ruthless Cuban immigrant named Tony Montana (Al Pacino) who aims for the top of the drug world and will destroy anyone who stands in his way. To help him in his rise for power is his close friend and partner named Manny Ribera (Steven Bauer), who should have remembered, if you side with the devil, you will get burned. Others who join Tony's meteoric rise to power are Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia) and Omar Suarez (F. Murray Abraham, associates who feed Tony's appetite for power, begin as friends then become obstacles. Tony Montana shares many stock features with dictators. He is bold, daring and most of all fearless. Unfortunately, like all maniacal men of power he forgets the most important quality necessary to remain in power, vigilance. This is something he fails to maintain as he also tragically discovers, his love for his sister, may not be platonic.

helped begin the decline of gangster movies,"Before ""Godfather"", cops and robbers movies were exciting and entertaining. Then came the long boring gangster movies which tried to make us understand gangsters. It doesn't work. ""Scarface"" suffers from lack of likable characters, lack of believable characters, lack of plot, lack of motivation, lack of a logical sequence of events, lack of fun, just a lack of everything. It is not an exciting movie. You fall asleep before you hear the action wake you up, and then you don't really care. Pacino seems only capable of portraying a pretty boy, even with a scarface, he tries to stay pretty in each scene. Its not totally his fault. The writing is pitiful. Pacino's character comes from a multitude of beautiful Latino women, and we are to believe he lusts after some middle aged looking, raggedy looking, rather pitiful looking, pale lifeless ordinary blonde? Clearly a woman wrote this part of the script. No man could ever buy into it. The plot fails, too. Pacino magically becomes a top master criminal because....well, no one knows why. Nothing is explained. Nothing makes sense. But then, the modern gangsster films are all that way. We don't understand the characters, partly because we have no idea what's going on.

Al Pacino plays a Cuban ""political refugee"" that comes to Miami.  He immediately becomes a hired thug and quickly climbs the Miami mob ladder to become a player in narcotics. Pacino's character's style - take big risks and the f*** with everybody else - leads to success and to his demise.The excesses of the characters made me sick to the stomach.

It also follows the formula of the main protagonist going through his own self-destruction. It is mostly entertaining, and VERY violent, so props. What I also love in away about it is it's tone. It never really takes itself too seriously, and for that reason is how it differs from the Godfather films. I also think that Al Pacino is great. I think it is a great performance.

The dialogue is so well written and Pacino delivers every line beautifully. The fire that burns inside him can be felt without Pacino ever talking; but when he does, it hits the screen like a hurricane. The action scenes are very intense and perfectly executed. The hotel room will always be one of my favorite cinematic sequences. The brother/sister relationship was purposely awkward and the dynamics are well portrayed.

It was funny the first hour.Hell it was even funny the second hour.But you push it to three hours and your asking. Correction, your not asking anything. The movie needed to do more if its going to be a 3 hour film. The Godfather is a good example of how much story you can fit in to three hours. Scarface is a good example of how slowly you can pass 3 hours. Ether way both films were 1 out of 10. At least the Godfather bores me for good reasons.Stone penned this film based on his addiction to coke. At least that's what I heard. And the film shows. Its a sucky thing to base a 3 hour film on.

Al Pacino gives a splendid role for the exposure of Montana's vulnerability in each of its aspects. a film about a choice using powerful cinematography, old clichés and a form of realism who impress again and again. maybe, a gem. or a lesson of high cinema who destroy forms and use a special message.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A disappointing attempt at a Gangster Flick,"Scarface, a film by Bryan De Palma staring Al Pacino as a Cuban Immigrant who works his way into the Miami drug business.I'd heard a lot of good things about Scarface, and being a big fan of Gangster movies I was really looking forward to seeing it, but in the end I felt quite disappointed. You never really get the chance like or even understand Tony Montana. You know has issues with his sister but you never know why. He seems cold and distant, and only halfway in I'd lost all interest in him; weather he died or not I didn't care anymore. In the Godfather you feel as though you are a part of the family and even though they're criminals you sympathise with them, but Tony you don't care about and so no matter what happens to him it has no effect on you as a viewer. I tried to like him but as hard as I tried I still wanted him dead. The story is rushed, there's the rise and the fall but that's all, nothing in between. To put it simply this movie is depressing the main character is a psycho but not in a good way. Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver was a psycho but you knew why, you understood and liked him, this isn't the case with Montana.Scarface has got to be the most overrated Gangster flick ever; it's dull, simple and distant. De Palma's directing is nothing special and the story has no heart. Characters don't develop they change and a lot of their actions seem to be out of character. Films such as Pulp Fiction immerse you in a way that every character seems real but Stone clearly doesn't know his characters and neither does De Palma, they aren't believable and this to me is the real problem.I never understand why so many people rank Scarface so highly. It's not a masterpiece; it brings nothing new to the genre and can't even hope to compete with other Gangster films out there. I must admit that for the first half hour or so I quite enjoyed it and the chainsaw scene is classic but from there on it just started falling apart. If it's a Gangster film you're after go see Goodfellas, go see what a real Gangster film looks like.5/10- As good as Pacino's acting may be even he cant save Scarface.

I could totally see a modified version that's only 2 hours and simple dialogue being less revered but more enjoyable to watch.

Definitely a classic.

You can't help but like the guy... he's not just some straight out one-dimensional vicious killer, but he is a guy who isn't afraid to be truthful and not be a ""cockroach"". He has some limits to his morality of not killing kids; wants to value his family, but at the same time wrecks it with no self-control. He's overly protective of his little sister that he would kill anyone for her. The biggest threat to him was himself.What's very interesting is how the film is able to capture the crippling decline of what happens when money and power/control gets to you. It's not just some shallow dumb movie shooting random bad guys that many action films is only able to do and there's no character.Tony Montana, ""Scarface"", is a household name now because it's all about the depth of the character.

mmm,"I'm pretty sure this will offend a lot of people but I actually think this film is terribly overrated. I always thought of it as a classic but I watched it again recently and found it disappointing. I think what bothers me is, first, that the film charts the very beginning of Montana's ascent through the ranks and his demise. His period of 'success' is played out in montage in a way that seems very cheesy and dated. My second objection concerns the character himself. Pacino's acting is fine but the character he plays is thoroughly unlikeable and hard to sympathies with. In other mob films such as Goodfellas, Casino, Carlito's Way and the Godfather the principal protagonist is also a gangster whose unravelling is self-inflicted. Take for example Carlito's Way. Carlito is killed as the result of a problem he caused, not anyone else which brings out the pathos of his situation so poignantly. In Scarface, by contrast, the protagonist is violent, angry and petty with no discernible traces of humanity. Even his relations with his family are nasty. The point is that I found it impossible to feel anything with Montana. The successful mob films challenge us by showing us real characters whose choices are motivated by love, loyalty, family etc. but who end up going down a path of violent excess from which it is difficult or impossible to escape. Thus, we meet characters that seem redeemable and so we are engaged and interested in their fate. Scarface simply tells the story of a thug who is a thug not because of circumstances but because he wants to be. As such, Montana's story is not one of tragic inevitability but just inevitability.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Duly satisfying, but uneven, and less than fully engaging","Howard Hawks' film of 1932 was unexpectedly fierce and hard-hitting, and even if not 100% impeccable it remains an outstanding classic. For as prevalent in pop culture as Brian De Palma's 1983 magnum opus, a remake, has been over the past forty years - tiresomely so - I've been in no rush to watch it, though I knew I'd get to it eventually. Looking past the memes and quotes, how is the picture in actuality? How does it hold up? Is its general high regard really deserved? Now that I've finally sat for it myself, my opinion is that this three-hour crime saga is: fine. It's fine. 'Scarface' is fine, and now I can say that I've seen it. I'm not specifically impressed, though, and in hindsight I think that my indifference to watching it in the first place was more on the mark than I could have known.Comparison to Hawks' movie is not necessary, but it is illuminating in some key ways. It's noteworthy that in writing his screenplay, updated and transplanted to a new setting, Oliver Stone drew directly from the prior work of Ben Hecht, W. R. Burnett, John Lee Mahin, and Seton I. Miller. The broad strokes of the narrative share kinship, and some beats, scenes, and smaller inclusions might range from deriving inspiration from to closely mirroring the 30s piece. Just as 1932's 'Scarface' included violence that surely well exceeded the norms of its time, the shocks of violence in 1983's 'Scarface' are at times more gnarly than even some modern horror flicks could claim. One significant, unfortunate difference, however, is that in imparting the tale of Tony Camonte's explosive ascension to power and consolidation thereof, on both personal and ""professional"" levels, Hawks' title was succinct and concise, speaking directly to mob violence and the volatility of Camonte's relationships. For as sharp as De Palma's title is in its most explicit moments while examining Tony Montana's rise and fall, other scenes with heightened emotions are a step down in their impact, and considerable portions of the length frankly seem to outright drag as the modern revision builds its plot somewhat unevenly, and usually with far less potency.Don't get me wrong, much about this feature is very well done. The stunts, practical effects, and otherwise action sequences are visceral, nasty, and definitely achieve the desired effect, not least with all the blood and even gore on hand. John A. Alonzo's cinematography is superb - crisp, smooth, vivid, and plainly fetching. The filming locations are swell, and the production design and art direction foster a meaningful ambience portending the veneer of class and elegance Montana aspires to over top of his criminal activity. Between the slightly grainy image quality that readily says ""1980s,"" Alonzo's cinematography, and the aesthetics in the visuals at large, the film is very easy on the eyes. To that same point, the costume design, hair, and makeup are splendid. There are a lot of very recognizable names and faces appearing here, and everyone more or less gives performances appropriate to the nature of the material, with some examples standing out more than others. Some scene writing and story beats are notably stronger than other instances. And I, for one, am of the mind that for as admirable as all these facets may be, it's the music that might be the top highlight. I adore Giorgio Moroder's score, chiefly driven by synthesizers and lending somber but flavorful airs to the proceedings, and other songs appearing on the soundtrack are equally enjoyable.Then again, some of the acting occasionally just comes across as empty hot air, or overacting, and that includes Pacino. More commonly, the acting is suitable, but doesn't make a big impression. There are some moments, including two in a scene at right around the halfway mark, where selected elements (e.g., music cues, shots, sound effects) combine into a wildly melodramatic flourish that's altogether laughable (and not intentionally so). Some of the dialogue is just lousy and uninspired. De Palma's direction gets the job done, but outside of those intense action sequences its strength is highly variable. And when all is said and done, what it comes down to is that this picture feels rather bloated, self-important in a manner that's conceited but kind of lazy, and downright overdone. It's good. It's not great. And I have to wonder: if not for a few choice aspects - Pacino's presence, the extreme violence, a handful of iconic scenes and lines - would we actually still be talking about 'Scarface?' Except in fits and starts or with irregular odds and ends, I'm not inclined to believe that the sum total operates at such a level as to concretely earn the visibility it carries in our culture.Every now and again the flick is distinctly striking, with welcome tension and vitality. At its best it is excellent, and it ends on a high note with a huge climax. I like it. I also think it's something that, more than not, we can watch somewhat passively, without actively engaging. It doesn't especially inspire that engagement. That doesn't mean that the movie isn't worthwhile, but it does mean that even as this boasts much heavier violence, coarser language, and substantial drug use, Hawks' 1932 rendition pointedly more vibrant - more consistent, more carefully crafted in every capacity, and with better performances. Unless you have a special impetus to watch De Palma's treatment I think the primary reason to watch could simply be its stature, but then we have the problem of broaching tautology, and fallacious circular reasoning. Watch, by all means, and may you get more out of 1983's 'Scarface' than I do. I do believe it to be duly satisfying on its own merits. But maybe I'm being too generous as it is in my assessment. I just don't think it's everything that it's cracked up to be, and with so many other features in the world for us to spend time with, this one need not be a major priority.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Amazing,"Cannot believe this is at 118 on the IMDB list. It's a classic, Al Pacino delivers a star performance in this. It's exactly what you expect a drug dealing gangster film to like and Tony montana is one scary little friend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Don't get high on your own supply,"Ostensibly a reworking of Howard Hawks' 1932 gangster classic, director Brian DePalma's 1983 crime epic SCARFACE remains one of the most hotly debated movies of modern times.  Although I myself cannot quite call this a masterpiece along the lines of, say, the GODFATHER films, I do think it captures the life of a criminal as well as any film has ever done.Oliver Stone wrote the screenplay to SCARFACE, so it not surprisingly also has a political slant to it.  The film opens with the 1980 Mariel boat lift, in which Castro allowed as many as 125,000 Cubans to join their families in the United States, free from his totalitarian regime.  The complication is that twenty percent of those who fled to America were known criminals.  One of the latter is Tony Montana (Al Pacino), a Cuban punk who gets in on the ground floor of an increasingly lucrative trade in Miami's Cuban community; the buying and distribution of cocaine.  He works his way up the ladder of the American dream because of the advice given to him by his mentor (Robert Loggia): never underestimate the other guy's greed, and don't get high on your own supply.But even as he makes connections with the Colombian drug kingpins who supply him with what he needs, Pacino also becomes increasingly power-crazy, addicted to his own supply (against Loggia's advice), and paranoid.  He alienates himself from virtually everyone around him, including his wife (Michelle Pfeiffer) and sister (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio).  In the end, he steps onto the toes of the wrong drug lord (Paul Shenar), who sends assassins to Pacino's Miami villa, resulting in a ferocious and hugely violent, blood-drenched showdown.To this day, SCARFACE remains a touchstone movie for a lot of very good reasons.  It is a withering critique not only on the excesses of greed, money, crime, and corruption, but also on our own anti-Communist paranoia which gave Castro carte-blanche to export his worst scum to our shores and thus accelerate the amount crime and death associated with the drug problem. The way the South Florida drug underworld lifestyle is depicted by both DePalma and Stone is very true to the essentials.  And although I personally found Pacino's Cuban accent to be overdone at times, his performance (four-letter words and all) was and still IS the center of this film.But SCARFACE is not necessarily the easiest film to like.  At two hours and fifty minutes, even with an interesting political undercurrent, it does seem longer than is really necessary.  The amount of times the ""F"" word is used (or variations of it) is perhaps a bit grossly overdone (I lost count of the number at around two hundred), although this too is perhaps close to the truth of its story.  Finally, SCARFACE is still one of the most violent films ever to have come out of Hollywood.  The chainsaw scene in the Miami apartment, the hanging from the chopper, and the ultra-gory shootout rank among the most violent sequences ever filmed.  I can recall of only four films that have this kind of nerve-shattering violence: THE WILD BUNCH, SOLDIER BLUE, TAXI DRIVER, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.Still, Pacino's performance and a fairly good, albeit slightly cheesy, music score by Giorgio Moroder are worth giving SCARFACE a '7' rating.  But this is definitely NOT a film for young kids; it is rated 'R' for some very good reasons.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Good movie however,If I directed this movie I would've gotten a real Cuban for that. I know Al Pacino tried to mimic the accent I give him the props but still its not so good its very exaggerated/stylized.

"A classic, probably best if not rewatched too much","Scarface has attained cult status, and has defined culture in many ways. It embodies the American Dream for the working class, where you can come ""from the gutter"" and make it big if you dream it big and work hard. It just so happens to involve drugs and violence.Such bad taste throughout, from interior design to clothing and manners, that might be the best aspect of the movie.Now, it's actually a pretty average movie, upon re-watching. You may love Al Pacino's performance, or absolutely hate it.The story is very linear, the characters are pretty one dimensional, the run time is very long, and the characters are all quite unlikable, with the notable exception of Manny.One redeeming feature is that the story played out so a sequel couldn't be made to milk the IP.I'd have rated it 6, +1 for the genre defining and cult status.But, really, i wouldn't want to watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
To all those who have given this film too low of a rating,"I consider this film to be truly influential in my life. I have read negative reviews regarding this film and I think that the people are interpreting this film in a very wrong perspective. It is not meant to be about complex storytelling (like the Godfather/Goodfellas), or be cinametically influential. Its about Tony Montana, the protagonist, all about him...his attitudes. He is the representation of the human spirit that can accomplish anything and overcome any obstacle. I think most immigrants/people of low socio-economic status get inspired by his ambition. This movie does not advocate to sell drugs, but to make it big in America in any legitimate business(real estate, sales, whatever). It is not meant to be taken literally every second, but you need to develop genuine respect for his mentality, attitude, beliefs, and everything about him. His character is so developed, and encompasses a time that was accurate in that period.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The World Is Yours,"Everyone knows how good the climatic shootout is but on reflection its amazing how average a film Scarface is. The set-pieces are superb but the bits in between chronicling the rise to power of Tony Montana are either mediocre or downwright boring. It takes three hours to tell the story of the Cuban heel while The Godfather took the same time to present a whole dynasty with even the smallest parts containing more depth than Tony Montana.Technically the film is superb, as you'd expect from De Palma, but the film has dated poorly. The music, which although in parts is great (the opening credits and closing credits) can be embarrassingly eighties and I was nearly blinded by the glare of a thousand white suits.Despite that though the film is entertaining and for some reason that I cant explain I love the scene with the goodyear blimp (The World Is Yours). Its a very cinematic scene, complete with a great piece of music, but its a shame that its ruined by the terrible scene that follows complete with an awful eighties song. Personally I'd recommend Once Upon a Time in America for anyone who wants to see a great gangster film about street level crooks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Why is this movie so great?,"I had heard a lot of good things about this movie, but I don't understand why some people think it is so great or how it made the Top 250 list on IMDb.My husband suggested that I see this movie after seeing a stand-up comedian who referred to the movie, and I didn't get the jokes. Instead of actually watching the movie, my husband could have explained to me that every other word was f***, and I would have understood the jokes completely without having to endure this film.The plot of the movie is extremely simplistic---man makes it to America, man does a lot of bad things, man gets justice in the end. Nothing interesting, no plot twists. The characters are written in a way that doesn't make me at all interested in what will happen to them, with dialog that doesn't ring true (but maybe it's just dated). The musical score is typical of music for the time (early 1980s, think ""Flashdance""), and is now very dated, and in no way relates to what we're seeing in the movie. With no plot, no characters I'm interested in, and terrible music, I was completely bored after 10 minutes of watching this movie.The excessive use of f*** in all its various forms (which starts to wear thin within minutes), and all the blood make this just another movie about gangs. I assume that if you are interested in pursuing a life of crime, then perhaps this film is in some ways interesting for you as a vision for your ""American Dream."" For those of us who achieve our goals through hard work, this movie only makes me grateful that I have my American dream and that I never have to watch this movie again.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Engrossing!!!!!!!!!!,"""Scarface"" has a major cult following even now, 25 years after its release. In 1983, Director Brian De Palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an American gangster. He did it with the help of a terrific screenplay by Oliver Stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast. The result was 'Scarface,' starring Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles.The story is about an immigrant Tony Montana (Al Pacino) from Cuba who has come to live the American dream. He is a hard core criminal and starts by being in detention, where he plots a murder. Next, he moves in the Florida where he starts working as a dish washer on a road side joint. The attraction of money and power drives him into taking chance with one drug deal that goes miserably wrong where his friend is killed, and he in turn kills other gang members. With his daring, he starts climbing the ladder of drug dealers, and reaches the pinnacle of power and wealth and gets more and crazier (due to drug addiction). Finally he is shot by his own beloved sister before being brutally killed by invading gang in his own palatial home.It's the one role which you can't imagine Al Pacino playing. This was his comeback film after a short break and what it comeback film it is. I think when Pacino leaves the ungodly earth and people talk about the role he will be remembered for, a lot will say Michael Corleone in The Godfather Trilogy but I will remember him as Tony Montana in Scarface.""Scarface"" is quite simply one hell of a movie, especially such an epic example of its genre. It is controversial among both movie fans and critics. The main reasons are because the film contains excessive violence and has become a sort of inspiration for ""gangsters"". I think both are wrong, because the miss the message that it tries to give out. If these people didn't just skip to the final 10 minute shootout, then they would realize what the film really says.Some of the scenes, especially the infamous chainsaw scene, are disturbing. Scarface is as savage as they say and much more. I'll advice parental guidance while watching this movie in front of kids.""Scarface"" is rightly acclaimed throughout the film industry as a genre-defining classic, up there with the giants of crime-capers, worthy of an Oscar it never had.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Nothing exceeds like excess,"It's no surprise really that this film is the most iconic gangster film of the 80's. This decade is synonymous with excess and a certain bad taste. Scarface epitomised these factors, it clearly connected with the times. Everything about the film is over the top, be it performances, dialogue, drug taking or violence. It's highly stylised, with smooth camera-work, elaborate sets and a striking sense of colour. All things considered, it's a definitive crime film of its decade.It's a loose remake of the 30's Howard Hawks film of the same name. It shares the rise and fall narrative but with a veneer of ultra-violence. Unlike revisionist gangster flicks such as The Godfather it doesn't end with the gangster at the height of his powers, instead it adopts the rise and fall structure of the 30's gangster films. In this sense, Scarface is a combination of old fashioned narrative, with 80's excess. It's director Brian De Palma was no stranger to controversy of course, with several infamous violent films under his belt, such as the highly stylised slasher Dressed To Kill. He was pretty fearless when it came to this kind of thing and he was ably supported with a script from Oliver Stone, who would of course go on to become a confrontational director himself. Clearly it would be insane not to acknowledge the input of star Al Pacino. His depiction of Tony Montana remains one of the most quoted film characters of them all, and overall it is a tour-de-force performance.Scarface is more than anything a highly entertaining movie. It always looks great, has an appropriately synthetic score from Gorgio Moroder and has plenty of bloody violence. The whole chainsaw sequence with the Colombians remains an incredibly intense and brilliantly staged scene. But it also has an interesting historical context with Montana arriving along with a mass of Cuban exiles, who indeed really did arrive in Florida to flee Fidel Castro's communist regime. So it's also a look at the way a foreign criminal tried to live the American Dream. It could only really end one way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Scarface - A Victim of Tragic Virtue,"Unlike the original, ""Scarface"" is no mere gangster movie.  This is a rare instance where the remake outshines the original, in this case with its withering criticism of American society and politics.  Forced into exile from Cuba by communist Fidel Castro, the ruthless Tony Montana finds America much more to his liking (a ""giant p**** waiting to be f***ed"").  He is the true American, detesting Communism's totalitarian restrictions on individual freedom (a ""chuvato on every corner"").  He personifies what to many is the true American success story, rapidly rising to the top by breaking the law, ""making his own moves"".  He is helped to the top by many ostensibly respectable and law-abiding Americans, including corrupt cops, lawyers, bankers and media people  - in exchange for a cut of the action, of course. In fact, America loves ""Scarface"" - he takes all of the risks, while they sit back, exploit and collect.""Scarface"" is ruthless but subscribes to his own code of morality (""I never ****ed anybody over who didn't have it coming to him"").  Whether it is the Communist murderer Emilio Revenga, the Columbians who try to burn him, the boss who tries to kill him, or the cop who tried to milk him, Scarface is merely the an inexorable instrument of justice for people who ""have it coming to them"".With the assistance of a South American drug lord and a corrupt State Department official, Scarface is about to escape jail by fixing the judge. His total disregard for even basic rules (""Don't get high on your own supply"", ""Don't underestimate the other guy's greed) and his radical indivdualism (Who put this thing together? - me.  Who do I trust? - me) are already leading him down the path of self-destruction. But in the end, he is brought down by a single act of mercy and goodness - his ""tragic virtue"" - his affection for children.In addition to financially exploiting people like ""Scarface"", our society uses him for psychological purposes.  He is the ruthless gangster-criminal we all point to as being worse than we are. (""So say hello to the bad guy""). But all he does is sell drugs to people who want to buy them and spend the cash on those willing the launder it.  ""Scarface"" would not be possible except for our own hypocritical evil.  Scarface is more lucid about this projection phenomenon and his own self-destructiveness than the other character is the film (""I always tell the truth - even when I lie"").At the end of the film, Tony Montana appears to be more moral and more of a victim than most of the other characters.Even though I don't like most of Oliver Stone's work, I have to give him credit for this story and script - it will stand the test of time and eventually be recognized as an American classic.   Also, the acting is uniformly superb, from Pacino's brilliance to the major debuts by Pfeiffer, Mastroantonio and Bauer, to the remarkable performances by lesser knowns like Loggia, Shenar and Yulin.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The various characters were likeable, yet unlikeable at the same time. It was all just really interesting and I fully understand why this has a high rating and why it's considered a classic.I like to read the negative reviews of a film, once watched to see if they have a point. The common point was that Al Pacino was too ""over the top"" of a character. I have to disagree to be honest, I thought it was done really well. The way his outbursts were more frequent etc the more he did cocaine was great and well acted.The reason why I haven't given this a 10/10 is for 2 reasons. Firstly, the length of the movie. For me personally, I found myself losing concentration. Almost 3 hours long I just think for any film it's a bit too much and it can always be condensed. Secondly, it'd the rewatch factor, I personally don't think I'd watch this again. I think it's a phenomenal film, just something I wouldn't throw on again. It's very much a one time thing.

A just about very good gangster classic,"Rating-8/10Scarface is a dark gangster film that has a great mix of dark and violent scenes mixed with near humorous parts which lighten the film up at certain times. With a lead role that makes this film better than just good, it also brings us good acting and some quotes that still are used in film folklore, worth a watch just to hear the memorable lines. I felt this film was just about very good, and here below is why so.The story as said is dark, it revolves around drug trading in 1980's Miami and a man bent on power to succeed. It is thrilling even at some times because it really makes you want to see what happens next and at times leaves you excited as to how Tony Montana will act upon a threat etc. The film has it's slow parts and can at times be a slight bit boring, but nevertheless the ending makes up for some of that with a big ending to a big story, a long story to wade through indeed.Al Pacino masterfully creates Tony Montana and brings him to be one the most famous gangsters in cinema, with his iconic voice and ever so crazy outbursts, you can't help but kind of like him(and his insanity). Michelle Pfeiffer does little to impress here I think and it is possible De Palma and Pacino were right when they said they didn't want her for the role. Steven Bauer as Manny is maybe the most well acted role ever but still manages to lighten the movie somehow and chips in well.I think the true man behind the camera here is Oliver Stone, he writes this so well and of course dealing with this own drug problems at the time, he probably felt he knew just what to do with the script. Stone writes well but Brian De Palma doesn't direct up to standards that the acting and writing are on, not a bad job at all but he never really brings the best out of every scene and can leave bits becoming stale and boring.There isn't really so much wrong with this, you could say there is too much violence and an overuse of it but I think at times it benefits from it and makes you more thrilled. I said about the directing, that could be classed as criticism and I also felt the camera work or maybe even the editing isn't done so well as some rather silly shots and the score quite often gets annoying here, the technical side has bits wrong with it in general.Gangster films fans should enjoy this as it mixes all you could want in gangster films together well and creates an even darker drug gang film. Don't watch if you dislike dark violence and things along that line as you will not enjoy, I will say it is also a powerful drama led in the role greatly by Pacino, but the violence contained in this might just throw you off it.Overall I give this a 8/10 meaning it is Just About Very Good, I think in the end that possibly Pacino just edges this over the line of just being good into very good with his brilliant portrayal. It is a long film nearly getting to 3 hours long but worth the watch for so many people who Ii know will just love not only the action scenes and the smartly written plot, but also the crazy tones of Tony Montana who just runs everything in this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

While I liked it...,"I also had some issues against it.Seeing this last night on the movie channel, and of course owning it, and also owning the script, I think it is a good film.It could have been better as well..After Tony and Manny quit their dish-washing jobs and after being in the US for a few weeks, they don't seem to be hard up for cash - even before taking on their new found careers as drug dealers.When they snort coke...and lots of it, they don't seem to get high...or if they are, they don't seem to change in any respect.Now if I were to stick my face in a bag of coke and inhale, my eyes would be red, my nose would be stuffed and my head would be focked...but that is not the case with any of the actors who partake in the fine recreational medication of coca.They just seem the same - and that does not fare to be realistic at all. They should have been wired, yappy, schizo, psycho and neurotic, but they weren't.Also - when Frank Lopez is about to be killed in his dealership, he crawls on his knees and begs to Tony, offering to pay him $10 000 000 not to be killed.That was just absurd...he whined like a baby...the guy was a high-roller and just caved in too fast...it didn't quite fit his character.With all the attention that Tony made in the bar and in the restaurant, nobody said anything...just not real.It was good, but as good as it was, it could have been better...However, it had some awesome lines - which will stand the test of time in cinematic history.I would have loved to see Tony Montana, after doing half a kilo of coke in one snort just sweating buckets, his eyes red and puffy, his lips ranting, his body shaking, his mind scattered and his character just ballistic and freaking...he did not...and that is where this film falls short.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Pointless,"When I first heard that Stone and Pacino were remaking Scarface I was intrigued. What did they think they could add to Paul Muni's Original? As soon as the movie came out, from the very first scene, I knew: nothing.The only thing the two movies had in common was the title. Why they had announced it as a remake was a mystery.So I sat back, now without expectation, to see what movie they had made.Throughout the screening I paid close attention to all of Scarface's elements, from cinematography to acting, and finally came to the conclusion that the only reason the movie was made was Stone's ego and Pacino's determination to prove how greatly he could ham it up.Scarface, despite its commercial success, is a manneristic disaster that never should have seen the light of a projector.I do not agree that any of its flaws are fatal - overacting, lack of story, pacing, poor cinematography have all been overcome in numerous movies.What made those movies was something to care about; Scarface lacks that quality. Tony Montana is a nonentity; Pacino's portrayal is not that of a independent character but of an 8-year-old's fantasy of being as bad as possible. In short, there is no Tony Montana - only Pacino playing out that fantasy.And this is a crime common to many, especially many successful, directors and actors. More common among the Europeans but spectacular when an American puts his ego above the audience.So Scarface is a movie about nothing and no one, punctuated with a great deal of equally pointless violence.Many have pointed out that Pacino's overacting and the extreme of carnage were meant to makes points, to portray the real-world carnage of the drug trade.Pardon me? There's no hint of reality in the movie. Pacino isn't portraying a low-life, low-class 'Gangsta'. Pacino's trying to achieve an epic ham. He succeeded so well that the character was left behind.My reason for writing this review now is a show I saw last night that traced Scarface's transformation from critical bomb to cult classic. One of the show's implication was that all the critics were wrong - I disagree for the reason listed above.As for cult status - fine, even if Plan 9 from Outer Space was a better movie.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The greatest gangster movie ever made.,"When I saw Scarface, I was very impressed and surprised. I expected to see an action filled, mindless, formula gangster movie, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that Scarface was a very well acted, well scripted and well directed movie. I do not think that it is in any way a better movie than The Godfathers 1 and 2 or Goodfellas, but I do think that it is a better movie from the gangster aspect. It is a classic story of the rise and fall of a crime kingpin. Al Pacino creates one of the most memorable characters in the history of cinema, and Michelle Pfeifer and Steven Bauer, while not outstanding, are solid in their supporting roles.Do not be put off by the fact that Scarface is a very long movie. Tony will keep you glued to the T.V. and itching to find out what he will do next. While this movie does have strong violence, it is nothing compared to today's movies. This movie is heaven for fans of the gangster genre.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Unexpected,"This being said, the film is indeed a great film. It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story. It has a very dramatic score (in true Giorgio Moroder style), which simply could give you chills, or bring you to tears. The film is rather lengthy, but it is a story, and each moment counts. The acting is terrific. Al Pacino - enough said. He can do any role that he puts his mind to, and this was no exception. Pretty boy Steven Bauer, as Manny. I didn't think much of him in other films he did, but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro De Palma's direction. Michelle Pfeiffer is a true gem as Elvira. Popping' fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in ""Grease 2"" she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye. But the three true diamonds in this rough are Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio as Tony's sister Gina, who when she smiles, or cries, we see her soul and her fresh way of living, and watch it deteriorate; Paul Shenar as Alejandro Sosa, a drug lord, who runs deeper than a river, and Shenar portrays him as so; and Miriam Colom as Tony and Gina's torn mother. These three dig the film as deep as it can go.This reviewer learned one main thing when watching ""Scarface"" for the first time. Always go into a film unsuspecting. All the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see. Only knowing De Palma (like I do) can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds. So ignore the rap crap, ignore the mindless violence supporters, and fix yourself a glass of Bailey's on the rocks, and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film, the real ""Scarface.""",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Scarface is good enough,"The Man, the Myth, the Legend
The One and Only, Tony MontanaScarface is excellent movie that's amazingly acted, amazingly filmed and well written. The casting is amazing as we have Al Pacino playing the notorious Scarface. I don't really know anyone else in the casting but that isn't necessarily too important as everyone playes their role with utter perfection.The film itself is a masterpiece, but like every film ever created (Apart from David Fincher's Fight Club) it has its flaws. The film's primary issue may be the length of the film (A runtime of 2hrs 49m) which may lead to some unnecessary scenes that may have little to do with the main plot or that won't really come up again in film. At parts, the pacing may be a little bit slow and you may find yourself losing just a little bit of interest. Apart from that, there is absolutely nothing wrong with this Crime Drama film, because it gives us a very mature, gritty and realistic point of view on what the Drugs, Sex and Money life can do to our psychology.The film is very enjoyable and offers us a very satisfying ending.

A Masterpiece,"I know that this film is hated by some people, but I don't care, I love this movie, for many reasons. The people that hate this movie say that is bad because it is vane, pretentious and over acted, well to me that's just stupid arguments.First of all, the film is not vane and empty, what about Tony's relationship with his sister, I thought that was very good. And also the statement made about the 80s, the hedonistic lifestyle that not just U.S.A but the world lead in that era, how many people like Tony threw their lives down the toilet by getting drunk, high, mixed up in crimes, and eventually killed. This movie has and extra meaning because of my country of birth and my age. I was born and still live in Colombia, and although I was a kid during the 80s, I still remember them and the legacy that still resonates in today's world. During the 80s my country was the birth place of many Tony Montana's, Colombia was THE drug country, and everyone here remembers the times of Pablo Escobar(the biggest drug lord ever, he was bigger than Al Capone) and so I think I like this movie so much is because the life style shown in Scarface was more common here than in the States, here we had very flashy and drug lords that had over the top houses, cars, fashion and all of that, and they were famous, everybody knew of them and their lifestyle, and so I can relate very much to Scarface in the sense that I find it very believable. And I think Pacino acted wonderfully, because that was the behavior of Colombia's drug lords, and so to me he is not over acting. And if you don't believe any of the stuff I just said well then, the movie is also very entertaining, it has plenty of dark humor, action, suspense, drama, and a bunch of other stuff. To sum up my review of the film itself, I think the statement made at the end is very powerful(THE WORLD IS YOURS), it show how the hedonistic and careless behavior of living in excess in every aspect lead to the tragic almost Hamlet like end for Tony Montana, every thing he cared and loved got killed, or abandoned him(his sister, his best friend, his wife, his mother, his mentor, etc.). The film has also a special charm, the 80s charm, I for one miss this era of bad taste and excess, I miss it's fashion, it's music, it's attitude(the world is yours), everything, here in Colombia the 80s were fantastic, because although the drug lords did all sorts of bad stuff, they were also beneficial in the sense that they helped our economy and Colombia saw a huge economical boom because of their huge profits due to the eager drug markets from Europe and the United States, since the drug lords gave lot's of jobs to architects, construction workers, the scene in the movie in which Tony has a tiger in a small island in his huge mansion is great because that was the sort of stuff that drug lords had here(they had birthday parties for their kids in which they gave out t.vs, or beta sets, etc.), and also they had a lot of money, and the spend it in Colombia, so, even thought it was drug money, it was money, and economically speaking, when money is inserted into the circular money flow, the GDP of the country grew, and so Colombia grew and changed from a small banana republic, to a rather big and prosperous country due to drug lords, that finished when the country entered into a recession(a rather chaotic one in the 90s but that's a whole other story), so, as you can see, this is a topic in which I have a great knowledge and interest, and so, I love the movie, Pacino's passionate performance(with a funny accent), and lots of other stuff I have already said.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the most iconic gangster films of all times,"And it is only a remake, not the original, but this movie has hit several generations, and in so many countries, even forty years later, especially in the suburb ghettos all over the world. This is one of Brian De Palma's highlights, though his genuine material was Hitchcock like topics. It is for him what DEPARTED was for Marty Scorcese: one of his best films, but with ingredients which he was not familiar with; Irish mob, and cops for Scorcese and Gangsters instead of psycho killers for De Palma. However, in this masterpiece, De Palma uses several of his usual tricks, editing tricks just before and during action scenes. And one of his trademarks, the opera like directing and photography, that we also find in so many of his movies, is also here. But this time, it is a damn bloody opera, gruesome, at a gigantic scale speaking of violence and excess. Al Pacino contributes at seventy percent to the success of the film, giving one of his forever most terrific performance, between THE GODFATHER and DOG DAY AFTERNOON, and in waiting for HEAT, thirteen years later.

Most Gangster movies has an emotional part in them, this is where Scarface is different. It simply is what the reality of the situation should be. If you haven't seen this epic movie, than i suggest you buy or rent this movie and experience what such hype is all about.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The world is yours.,"In this notorious 1980s update of the 1932 gangster classic, Al Pacino is tremendously entertaining in the role of Tony Montana. Tony is a lowlife sent by Castro's Cuba to North America along with much more decent, hard-working and honest Cubans. As an immigrant, he's determined to take the quickest route to wealth and success, no matter who has to get hurt along the way. With Manny Ray (Steven Bauer) as his constant sidekick, he works his way into the position of a reigning drug lord in Florida.It may be simply a matter of personal taste how one responds to this admittedly grim and utterly nasty ode to crime and pathological greed. Tony is absolutely nobody to admire (although his exploits have since gone on to inspire a number of gangsta rappers), and is pretty much as bad an antagonist as you can see in this sort of entertainment. He's crude, aggressive, foul-mouthed, and incredibly brutal.Yes, the film does go on for almost three hours, and yes, it amounts to almost three hours' worth of excess. But, as Tony's junkie trophy wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer) says, ""nothing exceeds like excess"". Some viewers may find it over the top and an unrelenting exercise in repulsing the viewer, but this viewer found it a blast; he tried never to take it too, too seriously.There's tons of gunfire and tons of blood before this is over, not to mention some great production design, widescreen photography, and gaudy 1980s fashions. The soundtrack is another plus, with a haunting electronic score composed by 80s favourite Giorgio Moroder.As the saying goes, ""Scarface"" is about ""as subtle as a sledgehammer"", really driving home the point that, ultimately, crime doesn't pay.Pacino is commanding as always as the flamboyant main character, ridiculous ""Cuban"" accent and all. His ""Say hello to my little friend!"" moment has been a part of movie folklore for decades now. He's surrounded by very fine actors: Bauer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (as the impressionable younger sister of whom Tony seems unnaturally fond), Miriam Colon (great in two scenes as Tony's disapproving mother), Robert Loggia (who's terrific in his final scene), Harris Yulin, F. Murray Abraham, Paul Shenar, Pepe Serna, Mark Margolis, Michael Alldredge, etc. Richard Belzer appears briefly as an M.C. at a club.Trashy beyond belief, ""Scarface"" is undeniably vivid and can boast a particularly exciting finale. It's far from filmmaker Brian De Palmas' best work, but it's certainly one of his best known.Even at two hours and 50 minutes, it rarely gets boring.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Brian De Palma's classic,"Scarface is about a Cuban refuge named Tony Montana who comes to the United States in the spring of 1980. When he and his friend arrive in Miami, they get jobs as small time drug dealers, but as the film progresses, they work their way up to becoming rich and powerful. However, greed and power consumes Tony, and he digs himself into a hole he can't get out of. Scarface is a good movie, but you have to be in the mood to watch it.The popularity of this film among teenagers like myself is a little skewed. When the movie was re-released in 2003, everything went insane with the action figures, beach towels, t-shirts, and other merchandise. Unfortunately, most teenagers see this as a violent gangster film with lots of swearing. Cool, eh? Or they just want to jump on the Scarface bandwagon. None really see the entire message of the film, which is that greed is not a good thing. This entire movie is an entertaining message. Greed can screw you over. Oliver Stone did a great job conveying that in the script. Ironically, he went on to direct Wall Street, which contains a speech about why greed is good. The plot is good and the dialogue is intelligent (even though it contains hundreds of f-words). The only problem I had was that the movie could have been shaved down to 2 hours. The movie is 3 hours long, and it really drags in some scenes. The movie doesn't get really good until the last 45 minutes.The acting is superb. Al Pacino does his absolute best in this movie. Tony Montana and Michael Corleone are the top on the list for Al Pacino's best acting jobs.Overall, Scarface is highly entertaining as well as a classic movie, but some people might get bored due to the length.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Scarface has somewhat become a cult classic over the years, but truth be told, it is a pretentious film.","Scarface is Brian De Palma's loose remake of the classic gangster picture of the same name by Howard Hawks. Instead of Chicago in which the latter is set, De Palma's film is set in Miami, giving it a timely relevance during the early eighties. During that time, there was an influx of illegal immigrants (many of them Cubans) into America, especially into Miami. Tony Montana is one of them, a fictional character created by screenwriter Oliver Stone (the Oscar-winning director of Platoon (1986) and JFK (1991)).Scarface follows Montana (Al Pacino) as he rises to power to become one of the country's most wealthiest and ruthless gangsters. He makes money through a lucrative business in drugs. Not surprisingly, he snorts cocaine himself. He is greedy, arrogant, and lusts over his boss' girl, Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer). In the middle of his huge mansion, there lies a sculpture with a ball on top with the words ""The World Is Yours"" emblazoned.The irony of those words are laid out in bare in the final sequence, perhaps Scarface's most (notoriously) famous one – a bloody shootout in which Montana wields a huge weapon and attempts to gun down intruders to his house. De Palma's film is very violent, and in an early scene, a chainsaw is used to torture a victim. This scene shows the director at his skillful best, using quick editing and indirect framing to suggest the gruesomeness of the act rather than through direct means. This makes it so much more stomach-churning.Scarface has somewhat become a cult classic over the years, but truth be told, it is a pretentious film. It is, in my opinion, a B-grade gangster picture dressed up as an Oscar contender. It is a campy experience, does not take itself seriously (to its detriment), and will probably get worse on subsequent viewings. The electronic score by Giorgio Moroder is absolutely appalling; it is dull, lacking in substance, and is a mismatch for a film with such a heavy subject matter.Al Pacino's performance is bad in a good way. He puts on a Cuban accent and exaggerates his acting that it becomes unintentionally funny. Montana turns into a caricature of sorts, like a cartoon character in an animated comedy. One could praise Pacino for elevating a sub-par film to something borderline watchable. Because De Palma has (wrongly) opted for a campy style, it is only wise for Pacino to take his acting in that direction too.While Scarface gives some insights into the lifestyle of the drug underworld, one feels that it may not be as definitive as Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990), the greatest picture of its genre, and many times more compulsively rewatchable. De Palma is talented but he is not a great filmmaker. He is way too inconsistent and his films do not often connect with viewers. Scarface would have been a failure if not for Stone's intense screenplay and Pacino's ""cartoonish"" performance. Montana is unforgettable, but Scarface is not.SCORE: 6/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Not someone I'd bring to dinner,"'Scarface' is a strangely alluring movie. The film is held together by Al Pacino's charismatic performance, the ostentatious '80s design and sets, and a dirge-like synthesizer soundtrack by Giorgio Moroder. Al Pacino's portrayal is really wonderful, giving an extreme amount of depth to an emotional, desperate character and helps the film redefine and brutally modernize the crime genre.Scarface chronicles the rise of Tony Montana, a Cuban criminal who immigrates to Miami in the early '80s and gradually attains influence in the drug trade. Tony's rise in the drug trade is interesting because it is the only avenue for his ambition. As a second-class citizen, an uneducated Cuban in 1980s America, Tony immediately realizes he will go nowhere working a 9-5 vending job. We watch him and his best friend work their way through gruesome early jobs and earn the respect of their coked-up drug boss. Of course, you can guess where the story goes since it has become so famous in modern film.There is a distinct contrast between Pacino's role here and in the Godfather films. This film is long, but the pacing is fairly continuous. There's even a montage (gotta have a montage!) at the beginning of the second half of the film to cover a long span of time really quickly. At times the film can feel draining because the drawn-out dialogs are often about such greedy, shallow, or heated personal topics -- or they just descend into Tony's uncanny ability to curse up a storm. Especially in the second half of the film, when Tony's personal vendettas and passive-aggressive traits become exacerbated by substance abuse.There are certainly a few twists in the plot, but they are somewhat predictable and simply have to do with Tony's bursts of anger. This is sometimes boring because the self-destructive nature of characters like Tony has been covered with greater depth by more succinct films ('Raging Bull', 'Aguirre: The Wrath of God'), so Scarface sometimes becomes something of an aesthetic experience. But then again, the aesthetics are so highly appealing: a flashy portrayal of Cuban subculture in early '80s Miami.I'm not sure if this film is quite as focused as the later Pacino/De Palma movie, 'Carlito's Way'. That one has a better sense of narration and features characters who are less distant. It gets to the point more quickly. But Scarface is completely unique. Scarface places the whole American dream within a newly interpreted context. Tony comes to America and works his way to the top through the only path that is open to him. It changed crime films forever and did something totally new with the classic rags-to-riches tale. Influential, ultra-violent, and interestingly admired in modern pop-culture.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Carlos, don't forget to pack your mini-chainsaw  you hear?","This is a strange mixture of reality fantasy gangster romance. It stays in the mind because it tries so hard to set a new record in violence and terror. I wonder what kind of reaction the makers of the movie expected from their public. Fear? Revulsion? Anger? Lust? Many scenes really are over the top and completely ludicrous, but I guess that is intentional. Why on earth should a Colombian drug dealer during an encounter in a stuffy hotel room be armed with a gasoline powered chainsaw? The chances that he'd himself die the first of carbon monoxide asphyxiation once he started the engine would be high. Well, maybe these are the wrong questions to ask and one should just enjoy (if that's the right word) the action. And Mr Pacino hitting a heap of white powder with his nose like a pecker bird might be worth the admission alone.It must be said, that the set design is very good with its mixture of real locations and slightly fantastic sets.

De Palma's Masterpiece?,"In 1980 Miami, a determined Cuban immigrant (Al Pacino) takes over a drug cartel while succumbing to greed.While this was inspired by the original ""Scarface"", it is not exactly a remake (something that writer Oliver Stone would not have accepted). Today, Hollywood loves remakes and ""re-imagining"" films, but they rarely get it right. This got it right -- it is so far removed from the original that the respect and influence are there without taking anything away from the classic.Apparently, De Palma was added as director when Oliver Stone was turned down for the job because of a recent flop. Who would have made the better picture? Hard to say, but it seems great that De Palma ended up with the honor -- this film is in IMDb's Top 250 and the highest-honored film in De Palma's career.

Scarface,"Well, perhaps enjoying is a bit of an odd verb when you think of the storyline, its characters, the amount of violence and of course, the f-bomb being dropped about 15,000 times.I like Pacino in this film. He shows us the violent anger we didn't see in Michael Corleone. We're Michael would say, ""Never hate your enemies, it clouds your judgement,"" Tony Montana's out killing everybody. Now granted, there are moments in his performance...or in the script where you have to laugh. The questioning scene in the beginning of the film is a fine example of this. When asked where he got that scar on his cheek...well, I can't write what he says in the regular version, but I will tell you that on edited version on TNT, it from was ""eating pine apple.""Frank was a businessman, not a killer. All he wanted was the money. Greed killed him, as it has killed so many people. I enjoyed the direction Loggia went with Frank. It has carried over his recent work and has made Loggia one of Hollywood's must durable supporting actors.Brian DePalma adds his usual blend of violence, but it seemed that for once, he was trying to make his own film.

Just Plain Overrated,"Thin plot.  Surprisingly good developement.  This is one of those movies about how a really selfish stupid guy (al pacino) used none of his wits or hard work to become very rich and powerful.

"Typical DePalma movie, disjointed, confusing, loud in every sense","I was not shocked to discover that Scarface was not a great movie, as DePalma is incapable of making one. I am surprised by its reputation and high rating after finally watching it, even accounting for the way many flash crime movies are way over rated. As with every DePalma film I've seen, you're left trying to piece together why something's just happened and make some sense of the story. Forget it, it doesn't matter who writes the screenplay, DePalma will mangle it.All that matters in this as in all his films, is the sensationalism, visual and audible. It's always loud, garish and colourful, but I wish it meant a bit more and was easier to follow. You just get vivid, desperate to be iconic scene followed by trite small talk then next big scene, so it's bang bang, drivel, bang bang, drivel, bang bang with no meaningful narrative linking them. DePalma was an awful film maker of highly commercial sensationalist entertainment. It's not Pacino's finest three hours either as you see his character portrayal slide into wacky caricature. But, as always with this director and this lead actor, it is entertaining!",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"""The world is yours""","The film scarface is directed by the one of the worlds most influential directors, Brian De Palma. Written by Oliver Stone, ""Scarface"" is a movie that is unforgettable,it is action packed,emotional and an absolutely blow out smash hit.The film is based on ""Tony Montana""(Pacino) a Cuban refugee who comes to America in search of the American Dream. Montana then becomes the ""Don"" in the underworld drug ring as he ruthlessly runs his empire of money laundering and drug schemes in Miami, Florida and even in Bolivia.This is a violent gangster movie in which some viewers may find some scenes unpleasant to watch. This movie comprises around 180+ F-words and is almost three hours long. This movie is entertaining,dramatic, and will keep you to the edge of your seat until right the end. As the film progresses You will begin to side with the Drug-lord an will hope things turn out okay for him. What makes this film unique to the other gangster films is the fact that this gangster has a heart and isn't a ruthless as he may come across until he meets alejandro sosa (Shenar)as you will find out.Overall this film is a all time classic masterpiece epic which is unforgettable and will leave you reeling.

Pacino at his best,"Scarface is an excellent movie with excellent acting, a good story, and minimal flaws. This is likely Brian De Palma's best directing, and the story along with Pacino's exceptional acting make it one of the best films of the 80's, if not of all time. This is Pacino's finest effort seen, not soon to be matched, and he plays a Cuban superbly. Steven Bauer also does an outstanding job acting, and Michelle Pfeiffer played her role perfectly. The plot was excellent and the music very fitting for the film's setting and era. Scarface isn't a short movie, but it's never boring and the scenes flow perfectly.

Sleazy does it,"Brian De Palma's 'Scarface' has become a pop culture icon - and apparently an inspiration to hip hop artists and wannabes everywhere - but the question I had is ""Why?"". After 30 plus years of indifference, I decided to finally find out.It's certainly infinitely quotable, and sports an impressive cast, lead by Al Pacino in a tour de force turn as Tony Montana. But it's also about an hour too long, overly dramatic, and at times quite cheesy. But more than anything 'Scarface' almost relishes its own sleaziness, and when it was over, I felt like I needed to take a very, VERY long shower to wash it all off.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
critic review for scarface,"As many classical movies, a category of genres control the main act of each movie. Joining drugs, explicit scenes, and gory crimes. Directed by Brian De Palma, the movie Scar Face (1983), talks about the 1980s period in Miami, Tony Montana (Al Pacino), a Cuban immigrant takes over a drug cartel while succumbing to greed. The movie got nominated for 6 awards including ""Best Performance by an actor in a motion picture"" for Al Pacino and ""and best classic DVD release"". The initial critical response to Scarface was mixed, with criticism over excessive violence, frequent strong language and graphic hard drug usage. Some Cuban expatriates in Miami objected to the film's portrayal of Cubans as criminals and drug traffickers. Contemporary reviews have been more positive, and screenwriters and directors have notably praised the movie. It is now considered a classic within the mob film genre and has resulted in many cultural references such as in comic books and video games. In my opinion Scarface really is a good movie to watch, its mature and gory scenes make it look like real events and that the movie was well developed. i recommend watching such movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
You Dirty Rats,"One of the most repellent films I've ever seen, and a travesty of the original. I was a Brian de Palma fan up till this film, and to my way of thinking, he's never recovered from it.It also marks a low point in Al Pacino's career, his most indulgent, excessive performance ever, but at least he bounced back. He not only makes Paul Muni look great in the original, he even makes George Raft look good.The whole film looks like de Palma, Pacino, and everyone else involved in it, stuck too much of that white powder that figures so prominently up their noses.

The Best Movie of All Time,"It seems fitting that I'm writing this review in December 2012. Thirty years ago Scarface was being filmed, and it only gets better with age.Everything about this movie is fantastic, and it all adds up to more than the sum of it's parts.Pacino, Bauer, Pfeiffer, Loggia and F. Murray Abraham all deliver fantastic performances.The soundtrack is classic 80's Giorgio Moroder, and is a predecessor to much of the dance pop of the 2010's (listen to Lady Gaga's ""Dance in the Dark"" for comparison).I still want a silver Porsche 928 and a 1950's Rolls Royce and I still want to live in Frank's house on Key Biscayne.We all know Scarface as one of the most quoted movies of all time, some great examples are are: ""What you lookin' at? You all a bunch of f**kin' assholes."" ""You got a look in your eye like you haven't been f**ked in a month."" And my two personal favorites: ""Five hundred dollars. For a bunch of f**king grapes!""

I cannot understand the love for this film.,"""Scarface"" is one of Al Pacino's most loved films....and I have a hard time understanding why. Unlike some of his other performances, such as in the Godfather films, there is nothing subtle about his character. Instead, he's bigger than life and seems more like a comic book villain than a real life drug kingpin. And compared to the original ""Scarface"" with Paul Muni (which itself is far from subtle), it looks even more over the top. Additionally, the film seems violent and nasty just to be violent and nasty. I guess it all just boils down to personal taste...and I am not a big fan of excessive violence unless there is some purpose to it.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Brilliant,"Not much more I have to say, simply one of the best gangster films ever made. Cements Al Pacino's legacy as a brilliant actor. Great performances from Robert Loggia as Frank Lopez, as well as a very young Michelle Pffifer and Steven Bauer. The amount of swear words on the film doesn't bother me either and the blood shed doesn't effect me either. Great amounts of research was put into the film by Olivier Stone and I think it shows. The final scene were Tony gets killed is legendary. Although maybe slightly unrealistic due to the amount of bullets he took yet he was still standing and shouting '' i'll take your bullets, c'mon!''.

Opinion,"Violent but a staple in movie history. A legend! Al Pacino portrays a character that seems somewhat exaggerated but is perfect in conveying how immigrants from Cuba would have to act in order to be/become successful. It is baffling to know that the movie was not such a big hit initially. Now, it has become eminent in movie history. Pacino is actually recognized more as Tony Montana rather than Al Pacino. His performance in this movie was unfortunately looked over at the time but finally he was recognized on how great of an actor he is. Pacino is not as debonair in this movie as he was in the godfather trilogy...guess it would be because of cultural differences.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

It makes an interesting watch and it will make the viewer wonder as to what will happen next and like the participants we do too like those criminals who thought becoming a gangster was all that - just study the rappers of today and their lyrics.Al Pacino is brilliant as the great Scarface without a plan. Needless to say what I found most fascinating of all is the fact that it is based on a real story.I think it was violent, but it also showed how violence begets violence.We're becoming a society that celebrates violence and that is tragic.

Decent Gangster Film,"I just saw ""Scarface"" for the first time. It is of course a well-known film and I expected it to be pretty bad but it was actually mostly decent and watchable. There are some graphic scenes and I wouldn't call this an enjoyable watch, but in terms of telling a story of a fictional person in a real time and place as a tragedy I think it works, so I rate this a 6/10, on par with the newer ""Loving Pablo."" Slightly better than ""City of God"" 5/10, but worse than ""Godfather"" 7/10 in my opinion. It really depends on if you like the genre I think, not for everyone, and you have to be in the mood. I'm also not sure if the music was cool or not, I could see it either way, and it was a little low to be heard. And I don't love the often moving camera. The film could have definitely benefited from a little less style and shooting, and more intricate plot details, and a shorter run-time. In summary, I think another reviewer ""rafaelloskipros"" hit the nail on the head regarding the theme, this is a film about entropy -- the natural decay of life, of all things. Our lives and accomplishments and even our physical possessions, everything in this world decays rapidly, regardless of what you do.

Excellent Film But Not My Favorite Pacino + De Palma Movie,"This movie in every way was over the top, just as the 80's was in America at the time. The acting is excellent, and for gangster aficionados such as myself the story was compelling and satisfying.Al Pacino is one of the GREATEST actors of all time in my humble opinion. And partnering up with the great Brian De Palma behind the camera is a guaranteed hit. However it is not their best work.No, their greatest movie together, and in my opinion one of the greatest gangster movies, and movies period, of all time is Carlito's Way.I know, this is a Scarface review, but it had to be mentioned especially because those who are really into gangster movies and this genre, must compare movies, that's just the way it is.Back to Scarface though, again I believe it is a must watch movie, but must be taken with a grain of salt, as it very over the top, and the most appealing gangster movies to me are the ones that no matter what happens in the movie, you feel like, wow that is very possible. It needs a sense of realness, where at times I felt like I was high while watching Scarface. However, it must be said this movie was chalked with some of the greatest quotes of all time from Al Pacino. One of which I had to write a blog post about @ The Hustle Never Ends.Anyways, I'm a huge Pacino and De Palma fan, and more so I'm a gangster genre fanatic. I wrote my top ten gangster movie quotes article just recently also on the blog The Hustle Never Ends.In closing, if you've never seen this movie, but are into gangster movies, you MUST watch this movie, even if it is 2017 and decades after it's creation, it is a true CLASSIC!",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"A crime classic! Quite possibly Brian De Palma's best film to date, and look ma, no Hitchcock!","Brian De Palma was so good at making Hitchcock pastiches ('Sisters', 'Obsession', 'Dressed To Kill', all highly recommended) that he is often unfairly dismissed as a major American film maker. Those movies, as great as they are, are only a very small part of his output which has covered a lot of ground stylistically, from zany comedy ('The Phantom Of Paradise') to thought provoking drama ('Casualties Of War') to superior horror ('Carrie'). 'Scarface' is a case in point. Arguably his best movie overall, certainly his most entertaining, and it's a Mob thriller, with absolutely no Hitchcock connections. Leonard Maltin inexplicably dismissed this as slow. I really cannot see what he was getting at. 'Scarface' is full of energy and never lets up for a minute. The plot sucks you in immediately, and never lets you go. The movie almost reaches the three hour mark but it is so compulsive you'd think it went for half the time. De Palma is really on top form here, and the script by Oliver Stone (before he decided he was ""a serious artiste"") is action packed AND character driven. Al Pacino gives one of his finest performances as Tony Montana, and he is supported by a first rate cast. Steven Bauer ('The Beast') in particular shows lots of potential, which sadly he has never fulfilled, mainly being trapped in b-grade hell ever since. Robert Loggia ('Lost Highway') and F. Murray Abraham ('Amadeus') are both excellent as Montana's ""friends"", but also keep an eye out for Harris Yulin ('Training Day') as a corrupt cop, Paul Shenar ('The Big Blue') as a drug lord, and Mark Margolis ('Pi') as one of Shenar's ""soldiers"". All three actors rarely get a mention, but are just as good, if not better as the more celebrated performers in this film. Margolis is especially chilling as a Colombian hitman in a very different role to his invalid mathematician in 'Pi'. An extremely underrated actor! But hell, even Michelle Pfeiffer is good here as Montana's coked up ""ice queen"" wife. It's really hard to fault ANY of the performances in the movie. 'Scarface' is a modern crime classic that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as the best of Scorsese, Coppola, Ferrara, Takeshi or Tarantino.

This was the worst casting I've ever seen, and the soundtrack will make you retch if you can't find the mute button fast enough. Pacino, who has talent, displays none of it here. Just a ridiculous over the top bad accent job. It's all just so cliche and contrived. His overprotective bit towards his sister is particularly grating. A few good scenes but not the ones you're thinking of. I liked one involving a helicopter and rope. One with a hotel bathroom.

As he is told early on in the film "" Don't get high on your own supply"" which is ironic as this is exactly what he does and he pays the consequnces for it. Brian De Palma directed this film to perfection and is probably his best film. People say that it is too violent though i believe the violence is appropriate to the plot of the film.

An amazing Pacino but too much exuberance and excess on the part of De Palma!,"A remake of the 1932 film starring Paul Muni, Scarface is a film set on excess with its astonishing action sequences, Stone's crude screenplay and brutal and often gratuitous violence. Giorgio Moroder's 80s-flavored music accompanies the film from the rise to fall of the Cuban gangster. The choice of the theme of the Cuban exodus is a pretext to tell the story of those who start from nothing and reach the peak of wealth. The song ""Push it to the limit"" is the very emblem of the protagonist who aims to have everything, regardless of the high price to pay. Pacino's remarkable and excellent performance eclipses those of the other performers in the film who are not up to the task. Al Pacino save the movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Icon,"One of the most iconic films there has ever been, Scarface requires little introduction. A colourful, explicit tale of one man's journey from flipping burgers to the world being his, Scarface is, behind the Godfather, the best gangster film ever made.Al Pacino is Tony Montana and plays the ambitious, ruthless Cuban gangster to perfection. At times, his accent is a bit off but the performance is now legendary and deservedly so. Martin Bregman knew Pacino well, thus knew how to make Montana a 'shoe-in' part for Pacino. Pacino's passionate performance ignites the film to life and immediately grabs the audience's attention. His charisma makes Montana a likable character in spite of his actions. Scarface is possibly Pacino's most famous role and with his career, that says a lot. Steve Bauer is excellent as Manny Ray, Montana's sidekick. The look of the character and the sleazy personality fantastically portrays the stereotype that Americans had of Cubans at the time the film was made. Michelle Pfeiffer, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Robert Loggia are also very effective in support.Stone did a great job with the screen play and imprints his legacy on the film. There seem to be plenty of political stabs during this film which Stone is famous for but they fit in due to the situation arising from politics. If Stone had directed too, however, I suspect the film may have been drowned with politics. Scarface proved a great building block in Stone's career, leading him to make Salvador a few years later. De Palma does a great job with the action scenes and fills the senses with colour, noise and bad language. Possibly too much bad language, to the point where the 'f' word loses its power. The only down point of the film is the soundtrack. It is very 80s and is the only thing that risks making the film appear dated.The film makes an example out of Montana for breaking the rules of the crime underworld. Getting high off his own supply, underestimating Sosa, he was warned but ignored all advice thinking he was indestructible. One of the best aspects of the film is how over the top some of it is, it withdraws the audience's sense of reality, only to bring them back down to earth with a bang at the end.Scarface is one of the best films ever made, despite being slightly overshadowed by Pacino. A true classic!",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

THE Gangster Movie!!! There can only be one Tony Montana.,"Scarface probably is the best gangster/crime movie with the best crime character and probably one of the best characters in general movie history Tony Montana.I just love this movie, I watched it dozens of times and I always love it more than the time before. It would be my favourite movie of all time, if there weren't this little movies called Pulp Fiction and From Dusk Till Dawn, which are my favourite movies of all time.However, this genius gangster movie from Brian de Palma starts with the Cuban refugee Tony Montana coming to the USA, getting disrespect from the very start of the movie, working at first in a little filthy 'burger' shop to grow all over this to become the biggest drug boss of Miami and probably the USA.Pacino acts his brain out in this movie, he learned to talk like Cuban's, his face acting is incredible and through the movie there are countless phrases spoken that will live forever like: ""In this country you gotta make the money first, if you got the money, you got the power, if you got the power, than you got the women, that's when you start your own moves."" or in the grande finale: ""..you wanna play rough, huh? Say hello to my little friend..."" just stuff like that.All in all, it's about the 'rise and fall' of a Cuban refugee that becomes a drug baron and falls as a drug addict maniac that wants to have it all and doesn't see what he already has.But that's not what makes this 3 hour epos so unique. This movie is so legendary because of the acting. Pacino simply is the coolest gangster of all time, the character Tony Montana is the coolest gangster of all time, and you love him from the beginning, because he maybe is a drug king, but not really a murder or worse because he has his principles and just raised up in a Castro government with no expectations to a successful living. Another thing that makes this movie to a legend are the phrases and specific scenes, like the one with the chainsaw and THE GRANDE FINALE, which easily is one of the coolest and toughest ends of all time.My summary is that this 'Monster Crime Epos' is a movie you have to watch, because together the acting, music, extreme violent speech and scenes, Pacino, Bauer, Pfeiffer... make this to one of the best movies in film history and without a doubt together with The Godfather to the greatest Gangster/Crime movie of all time.Easily 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Powerful, classic '80s gangster flick","A very powerful, extravagantly violent update of the old gangster-film genre that just radiates all the excess and egotism of the 1980s. Pacino is in top form as a Cuban refugee in this dark, socially-challenging take on the old ""rags-to-riches"" stories that epitomize American capitalism. Using the 1980 Mariel Boatlift as a launching point, two potent filmmakers (writer Stone and director DePalma) challenge '80s myths of wretched excess and narcisscism, and it could not have been done without Pacino's brilliance at portraying the self-obsessed, arrogant yet insecure hero Tony Montana. A good film to compare and contrast with ""The Godfather,"" (daring immigrants, American dream, underworld morals, etc.) but this time the film's focus is on a single determined man rather than a large organization.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This is an okay movie but it is pretty overrated,"The Godfather, The Godfather Part 2, Pulp Fiction, and Goodfellas are usually called some of the greatest gangster films ever made. However, Scarface also gets a lot of praise from the audience and it is often compared to them and sometimes it is even considered to be the best film from the genre. I disagree.Tony Montana, a Cuban criminal, slowly takes over a drug cartel as he slowly succumbs to greed and eventually goes mad with power.Firstly, this movie does have its positives. Firstly, the acting is great. Al Pacino does a great performance here and his acting gets more unnerving as he gets more greedy as the film goes on. The other actors gave a good performance too but Al Pacino did the best job. It's not as groundbreaking as his performance in The Godfather Part 2 but it is still great on its own. The score is very memorable and fitting also.Also, the final 20 minutes are very well-done. It shows how Tony's fortunes and wealth begin to collapse in on itself and he finally gets what's coming to him. The gun battle at the end is masterfully done. It contains a very quotable line of dialogue and it is executed very well. And by the time the end result comes, it is certain to make your jaw drop. Also, the other couple shootout scenes are very stylized and well-done too.However, this is why I think that it isn't as good as other movies from the genre.The longer a movie is, the more likely it will run into pacing issues. Being 170 minutes long, Scarface does in fact have pacing issues and it doesn't have the same perfect pacing that The Godfather did. The issue with its pacing is that it takes a while for them to set up Tony's character and it also takes a while for his personality to change in the movie.Also, I found this movie to be very bland. Sure, it picks up in the last 20 minutes but there isn't a whole lot of action going on beforehand. I mentioned that this movie has pacing issues and those issues can often make it feel very boring. Not much exciting or interesting events go on in it. Several scenes should've been shortened or removed altogether.But despite what I said, this is not a bad movie. It does have its flaws but I'd say that it has a little more good things about it than there are bad things. This is entertaining if you don't mind bland movies and the slow-pacing. I just don't think that it's as good as other highly-praised movies (which I listed earlier) from the same genre.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
One of the most over-rated films ever?,"Scarface is a strange film, which due to its strong cast and popular subject matter (gangsters) has become hailed by many as a great masterpiece.Sorry, but it's not very good. After a promising introduction, when it looks as though this may be a serious drama, things look up. The early motel shoot out is claustrophobic and well handled, and the infamous 'Chainsaw & Bathtub Scene' is very scary indeed. However, it goes steadily down from there, and as this is over 2 1/2 hours long (on the UK cut), it goes down a long way, to a ridiculous climax which throws all of the tense realism of the earlier scene out the window. Pacino's performance is good as usual, although all he really does is look stoned/shout ""FOCK DIS! FOCK DAT! FOCK YOU, FOCKER!""etc., and supporting performances are good. The film is also very downbeat, so after 2 1/2 hours, you feel really depressed (or bored) watching it. I recommend you watch the film, but stop as soon as you start to feel it drag, instead of waiting for it to get better, as I did. IT DOESN'T.You might like it. But approach with caution:- it's not a classic.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Extremely overrated. First I thought it was reprehensible, but then I thought it was hilarious","I'm ashamed that I even watched this. I saw it was on TV one night, and I love crime dramas/neo-noir, so I thought I'd give it a try. I wanted to see if it lived up to the hype it receives. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. Hugely disappointed, to tell the truth. I really will never understand why so many people rave about this movie. It's tedious, overly violent, sleazy, misogynistic, and repulsive. For 3 hours, we watch a Cuban immigrant (Al Pacino) rise through the ranks of the drug trade, alienating and destroying the relationships of his family and friends along the way. He strikes his own sister after following her and a guy she was dancing with into the men's restroom, because he was so mad at her for wanting to have sex with the man. Sheesh. He reacted with so much rage, that I thought she was his girlfriend when I first turned to the channel the movie was on, without having known the roles of all the characters. Then he marries another man's wife (Michelle Phieffer), and starts verbally abusing her. The language throughout the whole film is so vulgar, that I'm glad I watched it on television. After a couple of hours had gone by, they were cussing so much that the picture froze. I agree with one of the people who left a negative review - maybe it is a guy thing. I have androgynous elements within myself, the feminine outweighing the masculine, and maybe that's why I wasn't entertained by this. There's virtually no women in the movie. He treats his wife horribly, to the point of it being disturbing. He doesn't want anything out of life besides money. The story is so purposeless, you know? But then again, was I not entertained because there was too much testosterone, or was it due to the story being absurd? I love The Untouchables, and there's hardly any women in that, so it has to be the former. Watching it more than once gave me the opportunity to change my perspective of it, because I was really turned off the first time. I think I was just shocked by the level of violence. I turned the channel and spent the rest of my evening watching something else at the scene where they were in NYC, attempting to assassinate a world leader by driving behind him, with the man's kids in the back. I just had enough. By the second or third time, I was less bothered by it, and actually found myself laughing. And that's when I realized: I don't know how anybody can watch this with a straight face. It's so ridiculous and unrealistic.My biggest gripe, if I'm being honest, is having an Italian-American playing an Hispanic. Just because there was a similarity in appearance didn't mean it wasn't ridiculous. In fact, the whole cast are all non-Hispanic. I know it was a completely different time. Filmmakers weren't concerned about offending people like they are now, but to have an entire group of people playing a race that's different from their own is quite outlandish. So that's strike 1 for me. As a person of color myself, I never liked how black, Italian, and Latino people are always portrayed as gangsters in the media anyway. Strike 2 was the cringe acting performances. I'm sorry, but Al Pacino really wasn't all that menacing. I don't know if it was bad acting, or if he's just the type of person who's funny without trying to be, but his performance was more laughable than anything. I don't care where I am - I can see a photo or something else from this movie and laugh. I saw a Scarface t-shirt when I was browsing on a clothing website and started laughing. It's just hard to take it seriously. It's now pegged as humorous in my mind. It's like a farce of the drug trade. The only positive I can identify is that it's quintessentially 80s. But I think it would've had a chance of being meaningful if the main character underwent a transformation of some kind. I like crime stories that have some type of resolution, or the people who are guilty of the crime are brought to justice. Scarface is just a movie that tried to be deep and serious, but is actually idiotic. Can't think of anyone it would appeal to, besides people who lowkey always dreamed of getting successful off of easy money, instead of going to school and getting a legitimate career. It's sad Al Pacino messed up his nasal passages for a crap film. He obviously wasn't snorting real cocaine, but to this day, it's still a mystery as to what it was. I guess he didn't ask the director or producer?? He said his nose hasn't been right ever since, and stuff falls out periodically 😆 I mean, I feel bad for thinking that's funny, but that was just a lack of common sense. If I'm expected to put something unfamiliar into my body, I'm gonna inquire as to what it is. Some famous people do the stupidest things for a paycheck. If you've never seen this, you're not missing out on anything. I actually look forward to it being on TV now, because I can always use a laugh.",1.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
scarred up for life - the spiritual side of scarface,"Much of the good things have already been said about scarface, to say it as a landmark film in the gangster genre is definitely without a doubt. Critics from the very first release of this movie have complained about the 210 f words and the violence, but these are things that are necessary to a gangster picture, especially one that represents a dynasty. (each gangster movie has a different style of doing violence, the 'cleaner' ones are that of godfather and once upon a time in America, De Palma's choice of violence in this movie is only to enhance the viewing, whether you like it or not, it is up to you. As a viewer, you should only have the right to comment on the quality of such style rather than completely denigrating it) Having said all that, i now turn to the issue that has not been discussed often on this board. To a segment of viewers, Scarface is not a drug movie, it's more about the determination for power, to go higher and higher in the world. There are no other issues that are more important than this, Bregman, the producer wanted the movie to head this way because it shows something that is inside everyone of us. Some of the viewers do not openly agree, but this is the main reason most of the fans are drawn to this movie. This movie represents the reality of the world, that to achieve success, you somewhat have to inherit Tony's traits. Tony's strength in front of the chainsaw, his wit when facing Sosar and his determination in the argument between Frank for the $15m deal are all very admirable and respectable. The audience love these parts, it is not wrong to respect someone who has paid a price to achieve his goals even though he did so through a rather evil but common street business of the time.To treat the movie as a 'bible' would definitely be too much, but it is rare to find a movie which gives such notion of survival in a capitalistic world.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

An American crime classic.,"After watching Scarface my thoughts were along the lines of ""Wow that was a great movie."" This was undoubtedly Pacino's best work (other than the Godfather Part 1). As well as having Pacino as the leading charactor Scarface is similar to the #1 ranking movie of all time, The Godfather. Both films have family morals, violence, and passion. One thing I believe that holds this movie back from being rated up with Godfather is the amount violence, there is hardling a scene where there is not gore or the F word being said. If you can get past the overkill of violence you will find a film that centers around a man that wants non other than the American Dream.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The world is yours,"THE WORLD IS YOURS.This is one of those movies that convince you that cinema is the superior art form. The way it can convey so much in a single scene is indescribable.

It's entertaining, violent, sad, funny, thrilling. Everything, from the acting to the score, takes you right into that world.

"Good, But Overrated!","Scarface is not a bad movie but compared to the gangster films from 1970-1995, it's only mediocre. Al Pacino, of course, was the best part of the movie. The premise is very interesting, at least enough for me to watch all three hours of the film. This movie has over-the-top violence but I respect that because these kind of movies feature violence all the time.This is about some Cuban guy who comes to America to gain power, wealth, drugs, and women. But he realizes all the power is not the best thing in the world.As I mentioned before, Pacino is the best part of the film. To make viewers aware, Tony Montana is very different than Michael Corelone. It was nice to see Michelle Pfeiffer.Overall, this is a good gangster movie but some scenes were tedious and over stretched.

a modern-day macbeth,"Scarface is a brilliant modern-day tragedy. Like MacBeth, Tony Montana's flaw is his insatiable ambition. Even though Montana may be morally dubious, we can hardly help but admire his drive and single-minded motivation. It leads him, in a relatively short time, to the top of his own criminal empire. Yet once he has gotten it all (the money, the power, and the woman), Tony - forever a man of action - realizes that he has nothing left to conquer. Now the cynical realization of the emptiness of all earthly gratification consumes him. Finally, the great tragedy comes when Tony finally acts upon his own moral reservations. Unable to become a complete monster (by killing a man along with his innocent wife and children) Tony signs his own death warrant and is destroyed by the criminal world in which he has made his fortune. Yet, even still the epic warrior, he is only able to be killed from behind, by one who hides in the shadows like a coward. Tony Montana may have been a killer, but one thing he never did was hide.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

The perfect example of the rise and fall of a gangster 8/10,"Scarface by Brian DePalma is a perfect example of the rise and fall of a gangster. From the origin story, to his challenges, allies and enemies, to his highest point, up until his lowest point and downfall.When you look at Scarface, you get all the elements for a perfect gangster story.Let's analyze the character of Tony Montana (Al Pacino), his character from the start has big ambitions and climbs himself to the top of the mountain to gain everything he wants, only to lose and be left with nothing.This formula to tell a tragic story has been repeated for eternity, but it is best portrayed and demonstrated in this film, both this film and the Godfather trilogy to put it in perspective. You know what? Throw in Goodfellas for more depth.Al Pacino's acting is spot on, the way he was able to portray such a character with ambitions who slowly falls to tyranny and madness is amazing and really astonishing. How on one hand he portrays a cool and wise character such as Michael Corleone and on the other hand portrays a character who is drunk of power such as Tony Montana is known other than true talent.Scarface is oftenly remembered as a famous and fan favorite film.

The dominant mood of the film is anything but funny. It is bleak and futile: What goes up must always come down. When it comes down in Scarface, the crash is as terrifying as it is vivid and arresting. An unashamed study of selfish, sadistic criminality, and all the better for it.

"Money, power, women--in that order","Al Pacino's Tony Montana is one of the most iconic movie characters ever. A flamboyant, self-glorifying man whose only purpose in life is to absorb more of the world onto himself. In doing so, he adopts a paranoid, antagonistic attitude--he views himself as a prey in a jungle of predators and his plan is to turn the table on everyone. Is Pacino's greatest performance--Montana feels like a parody of himself.Like Icarus, Brian De Palma's protagonist rises too fast too soon. His hunger is insatiable. Among the movie's many quotable lines, one which defines his greed more than anything is his conversation with his long-time friend, Manny Ribera (Steven Bauer). Unlike Tony, Manny is happy with being the middle-man in the mob world. Not Tony--he wants ""the world chico, and everything in it"". This timeless sentence emphasizes his obsession. It basically says the same thing twice because he wants to make it clear. Bluntness is his most well-defined trait. A man who cannot lie. He does not hide from the problems, does not solve them, he destroys them, wipes them from existence.The first few scenes depicts the more factual elements of the plot. In the early 80's, Fidel Castro briefly allowed inhabitants to leave his country. It was a good way for him to empty his prisons. Among the usual clean citizens, there were also men like Tony Montana. As soon as he is released into the city of Miami, we are exposed to the town's duality. An exotic, neon-sprinkled utopia, but as we get closer to the ground, we are exposed to its rotten core--a drug cartel infested temptation. The score, by the great Giorgio Moroder is yet again, luxurious, denoting a land of opportunity yet one that while offers you all the worldly pleasures in the world, takes away from you everything else.As Tony makes his way to the top, he works for a local drug lord, Frank Lopez (Robert Loggia). Whereas Tony's friend, Manny, is happy and feels fulfilled to simply be part of the world, Tony never lets his guard down. He is observant, plotting ahead, as he feels like an impenetrable wall, a man who despite the promises given to him by others, only listens to the voice inside his head. ""Who do I trust? Me!"" When Tony lays his eyes for the first time on Lopez's bored trophy wife Elvira (Michelle Pfeiffer) he repeats again and again that she'll be his (even to her own face) and by his attitude you get the impression he can pull it off as, indeed, he does.Frank likes to be a mentor to Tony, and so he spills out some beginner's guide to vagabonding lines: ""Rule number one: don't underestimate the other guy's greed. Rule number two: don't get high on your own supply"". The first rule was never a problem for Tony as he seems to be naturally tense. He is always looking, always watching. Even when he is engaged in business talks, he always looks around him. Paranoia would be a drawback for any person but Brian De Palma created such a convincing criminal underworld that for Tony is more of a positive trait--everyone around him relaxes now and then; he never does and you feel safer for that. The second rule he breaks over and over again. The movie's most powerful scenes come from seeing Tony surrounded by cocaine, alcohol, succumbing to their control.But there is more. During a heated argument between Tony and Frank, he also warns Tony about making too many moves, He tells him that if he wants to last, he needs to be more tactical. Yet in the end it is not Tony's caustic attitude that ruins him, but his humanity. If you seen the film, you know what I mean-- the scene in which he is sent to assassinate a journalist who's been snooping around is the only time Tony breaks his own rule and lets his guard down, not putting business first. His humanity is also seen as he interacts with his mother and sister especially in one particular homecoming scene. He made it, he tells his mother but she is not impressed and soon he realizes how little ""made it"" means. In one great scene in a restaurant he rants about the emptiness coming with money, power and women--always in that order. It might be the only scene in which the average Joe can relate as he realizes that all the expectations and eagerness coming with climbing the road to success are gone away once you get to the top and they are replaced with... nothing.The year was 1983. Brian De Palma created what is arguably the father of all macho action films. This might not be something to brag about but ""Scarface"" remains a landmark piece of cinema for the way it juggled so many taboos in an era when those taboos were not cliche.

The rise and rise and crash of Tony Montana,"This movie falls with considerable ease into the category of being one of the top movies of the Eighties. All facets of the movie were extremely strong. The direction was fantastic, but for me it was the acting of Al Pacino and the script of Oliver Stone that were the attributes of its success. These are the elements without which the allure would have been adversely affected. Given the commendable contribution of the rest, this serves as an indication of the enormous talent of these two.Scarface' is the name of the movie, and therefore its core focus. Tony Montana is Scarface and the central character in a frontline Hollywood movie always requires a powerful leading man exhibiting charismatic appeal, acting ability or both. Al Pacino is a popular actor whose acting ability graces the big screen. The role of Tony Montana could have been hammed up and appeared contrived, but neither is evident here. Instead we have an authentic portrayal of a Cuban exile that comes from a hard background and finally wants to prove his worth in the free country, America.Pacino manages to show the unschooled background of Montana without overacting. It was not the result of the Cuban accent he used which limited his grasp of the English language. It was more through his mannerisms. The emotive outbursts are clearly part of the character makeup and show his determination to make the world his own. Although he may be unschooled, he has the street savvy through which the confidence oozes in confrontational situations. Pacino is probably the best at playing the tragic hero. These are usually complex characters that the audience has to support no matter how depraved they are. Montana is a tragic hero because he is doomed from the start. Frank tells him that those who want it all never last was a message that was never heeded. He is also told to never get high on his own supply. These two unheeded messages are the mechanism of his downfall. Montana begins his slide from grace when the bank dealer raises the rates on him. It is from this point on that Pacino shows us how Montana starts to feel like a failure. He begins to want full credit for his success and starts to distance himself from those closest to him. Everybody else becomes a target for blame as Montana fails to take account for the realities of the world and his own failings.Of significance is that he fells that he cannot escape his depraved nature. The only redeeming factor that he has is a burden because he is all consumed by power. Tony becomes possessive to the extreme. He will not let anyone near Gina since she is like a child to him and the only thing pure in his life. In the end his self  obsession results in all that he cares for doing away with him. His business partners want him out of the picture and his sister turns on him, who snaps under the strain of overbearing control. The tragic hero is about to meet his dire end. Pacino explodes into an inhuman rage as he faces his foes as he is unwilling to accept defeat and to relinquish power - power which he had always wanted  results in a gruesome death under the statue which epitomises the mind- set of Tony Montana  The world is yours to own'. The explosive rise met an explosive end, indicative of the time bomb that he was. It was only a question of time.Oliver Stone has delivered a script which is in tandem with his style. We have the central character with virtually no redeeming characteristics and as usual a solid message fro the audience. All the supporting cast are inextricably linked to the life of Tony Montana and some issue warnings which he chooses to ignore because of his insatiable thirst for power. Stone shows that there are rules to abide by and a self  obsessed conquest for power will result in the possible loss of all that we care for. We are shown how people are obsessed with material gain as an indication of success in America. Pursuit of the American dream must be done with circumspection and respect for people, no matter how great the appeal of the superficial perception of success. Also of note is that the story flow is unabated and well beyond interesting.The name of the movie, Scarface', is not used throughout the movie. Its purpose was to serve to illustrate the depravity of Pacino. He cannot escape who he is. He is bad and the scar is indicative that he will not change. The tragic hero's journey is one of doom, and Stone indicates this at many points throughout the story.The movie starts off with a documentary feel to it. This relates a sense of authenticity and sets us well into the timeline. Although the events are dramatised, this start assists the audience in accepting the hatred that is evident in the movie towards people like Pacino because they degrade the Cuban people and lower the American quality of life. The movie accentuates this affect and creates a sense of human tragedy, tragedy offset by two opposing systems  communism and capitalism.The supporting cast all deliver excellent performances. Robert Loggia is good as the seemingly weak drug boss from which Pacino derives justification for his path to success. Pfeiffer is believable as the smart wife who may not have full control of herself, but is confident enough to tell it straight, much like Montana. Steven Bauer shows us how a wise guy playboy of Cuban descent should be portrayed. Even though only a small appearance, we can see the talent F. Abraham Murray. He plays the weasel dealer whom no-one can trust and fawns to the big players.Gangster stories if well crafted sell well to audiences. The appeal of people living on the edge outside of society's acceptable norms, living the high life is conducive to the big screen. They are larger than life and their emotions make for creative character interplay. All this is evident in Scarface. Not all gangster movies have to be about the Mafia and this is the best one outside those oversold stories.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Entertaining but Flawed,"""Scarface"" is not the masterpiece many believe it to be.  It is also not as terrible as many others believe it to be.  What it is is a prime example of De Palma's over-the-top style of directing.  Everything about this movie - the script, the acting, the directing, are all overblown.  And while it shows no restraint whatsoever, perhaps that is part of its interest.The story chronicles the life of Tony Montana (Al Pacino), a Cuban immigrant who rises to power in the Miami underworld.  It begins with his rise to power from nothing, and continues on through his downfall.  The script is well written for the most part, except it tends to drag in places and is quite loose.The acting is solid, but as said before, perhaps a little over the top. Pacino is convincing as Montana, and most of the cast performs well, although everybody seems to be in an extremely emotional state at all times. Much of the dialogue is angry, and the characters are never really fleshed out to any great extent.  The major flaw in this movie is the fact that most of the characters are rather despicable, eliciting little sympathy from me.The directing is interesting to watch, but needlessly flashy.  Take, for example, the scene where Montana is getting in the car and the camera does the track out, zoom in trick, used most notably in Hitchcock's ""Vertigo."" Obviously, this is a display of Hitchcock's influence on De Palma, but what De Palma forgets is that Hitchcock used it for a reason. In the context that it is used in ""Scarface"", it is totally unnecessary. But, it fits in with the over-the-top appeal of the movie.While I wouldn't say this movie is excellent, it does provide some solid entertainment.  And despite the fact that it does drag a little, and is lacking in character development, it does succeed in providing some excellent action sequences, which will definitely please many fans.*** out of ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A masterpiece,"This movie is truly a masterpiece that will be remembered for a long time to come. It's way more than just a gangster movie and captures the hardship, emotions and deception of the dark world of the drug-lord. Solid acting is observed all the way through. Al Pacino plays the role of the Cuban-American drug-lord, Tony Montana, brilliantly. Tony's amazingly ruthless and determined approach in his ascent to the top is a marvel to watch, yet he is sensitive and honest enough to recognize his humble background and lack of intellectual skills.What was also striking about the movie though, was that the main characters around Tony (friends, family and adversaries) were caught between their loyalty for him and their own dreams of happiness or greed. Yet, as time goes on, there is a tangible sense of realization brewing inside these figures, just waiting to burst to the surface. This progression produces a spectacular conclusion for each of Tony's devotees. As he gradually begins to hit the self-destruct button, they inevitably follow suit, with tragic consequences.The message is clear: if you want to fly too high in a world where you make up the rules as you go along, you will burn your fingers and eventually fall, far and hard. This is amply demonstrated in the final scenes of the movie with the lead character's quite spectacular ""fall from grace"", in more ways than one !",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tony Montana wanted and conquered the American Dream but with a vengeance.,"Scarface is another one of those classic movies we all have come to enjoy. When I first saw Scarface with my uncle and aunt about a year and a half ago I enjoyed it but still it was a disappointment. Scarface is good but still you find many other organized crime movies that are better. I must hand praise to Brian De Palma who did a terrific job with this work, plus this ranks as one of the better performances from Al Pacino. Pacino is nearly great as Cuban refugee Tony Montana who emigrates to Miami, Florida to make a fortune in the underworld of organized crime as he goes to the top of his game with a vengeance. I must say this about Scarface if you enjoy much cursing and the blood and guts violence then this is a film for you. I remember the chain saw scene in the motel now that was gore! Yet this is organized crime in Miami, Florida during the 80's so the film was certainly correct with it's demonstration of violence. The performance by Steven Bauer is also worth a notice. Scarface is a great film that shows how success of the underworld goes, this is one of the better films associated with Al Pacino a great film to rent and watch if you haven't.",6.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
ridiculously overrated,"I have to say that this movie was pretty damn awful.  Sure, Pacino was fantastic in his portrayal of a Cuban drug over lord, and he had some pretty classic lines, but these were the only redeeming virtues of an otherwise lousy flick.

Deserves More Credit Much More,"If you haven't seen Scarface then stop reading this review and go out and watch it. I don't care who you are even if you're the wholesome kid next door who listens to nothing but folk and gospel. Get out of your house right now and get a copy of this film. I'm not a ""gangsta"" but to this still is one of the best films today. Pit it against any new film out today and Scarface wins hands down.Now time for the review; Scarface as you know is the story of a Cuban exile that is sent to America. His name is Tony Montana. He is an ambitious man with a very troubled past hence why he was exiled. He takes the ""American Dream"" to the next level. He has a partner with him the whole way named Manny the two starts out as low level gangsters and become the tow biggest drug kingpins in the world. With that said let me tell you why Scarface is a great movie. Scarface is not just a shoot em up gangster movie it actually shows the good and the bad sides to being a gangster. And this film shows both sides not like others who only focus on the bad this film put just as much emphasis on the good side to doing wrong as the bad side. So we have your basic rag to riches story with one catch. Montana is a man so firmly in his principles that he won't let anyone compromise them. We see this from the beginning till the bitter end. Along the way we meet some good supporting characters but this movie is basically AL Pachino's movie. I've seen a lot of AL Pachino's work and a lot of it is good but none of his films come close to Scarface except for the Godfather trilogy and their about equal there. So clearly many people might gasp at the fact that this film is very violent well Oliver Stone did real research and found out that all the violence in this film is plausible. If you take the time to think about it if your were on drugs 24 hours a day and made massive amounts of money selling drugs your going to have to spill blood. The reason this movie truly stands out among other gangster movies is that it gives the audience a chance to see the life of a drug kingpin and one whose one bad a** mother Fu****",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
This is the best gangster movie ever filmed.,"""Scarface"" and ""Goodfellas"", are the best gangster movies ever filmed. Let's see why ""Scarface"" is an amazing movie.Tony Montana, who came to the United States thrown out by the Castro's regime with his friend Manny alongside in search for the American Dream, has ended up being involved in the drug business, instead of working legitimately. His personality is flawless, because he is very determined to reach his goal and to get what he wants. Still remaining one of the most influential bad guys of all time, Tony had reached the top of his dream, with his criminal empire at its peak and with a few people by his side. Sadly, however, you can't always stay at the top forever. Slowly, Tony starts making so many mistakes that it led to the end of his life.Pacino shows us the violent anger we didn't see in Michael Corleone. Where Michael would say ""Never hate your enemies, it clouds your judgment"", Tony Montana would kill everybody. He proves to be the greatest actor ever (along with Robert De Niro). He manages to bring reality to his character by adopting a Puerto-Rican accent for the film-making purposes and leaves a strong impression. Pacino's Montana rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train.So like i said, this is definitely my favorite mafia movie of all time, because it shows (although violently), that Tony Montana was a determined man who sets his eyes on his goals and goes through every obstacle that stands in his way.This gangster film is harsh, very violent, loud, gross and must hold the record for uttering the word ""f**k"" the most number of times.This is a masterpiece and i strongly recommend it to you.«All I have in this world is my balls and my word and I don't break them for no one.» Tony Montana.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

stylish but ultimately pointless,"The good points are that Al Pacino looks very cool in this film, it's shot quite interestingly and is an interesting tale of one hard-done-by and hard-man's tale in a tough world of bad men, drugs and drug barons. To be honest, it's almost like an episode of Miami Vice, but it's just very very thin overall, one of those movies that if you watch it late at night, while drunk and half asleep it sort of makes sense, but actually it's full of plot holes, awful dialogue, nice suits, terrible special effects and very very forgettable supporting roles.I've just finished watching it, and my overriding impression is that of a coffee advert with guns and drugs.

Great for the 80's...not so much now.,"If you want a movie that sums up the bloodiness of action films in the 1980's, but also sums up the awful use of synthesizers, and highlights the outrageously ridiculous fashion hold overs from the 70's, Scarface is the film for you.Having grown up hearing how wonderful the film was, I went into viewing it with high expectations...which were entirely not met. The film is almost comic in appearance and sound, and is a prime example of what happens when things just don't age well. For those who were about when it came out and remember the early 80's fondly, then it might well be your favorite film. Anyone else, I'd suggest at best watching it when it shows up on cable, if not at all.For those who aren't aware of the film's premise, its about Cubans who come to America, when Castro released thousands from his prisons, taking advantage of American asylum promises. The main character and pals move in on the organized crime/drug trafficking in Miami...stir in your usual power/money corrupts scheme, and you've got yourself a movie. I've long thought the main reason folks like the film is only to shout out its tag line,""Say hello to my little friend!"" ...and that may be the most redeemable trait of the film.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Can Movies Change Your Life?,"The main write-up on IMDb site for Scarface is woefully inadequate. I was born in Canada and have lived in 4 other countries in different parts of the world. I can testify that few films resonate as strongly with their audience (particular men) as Scarface. Why is this the case? 1: The acting- Pacino delivers the most compelling performance of the 80s in this film. 2: The script- Oliver Stone's true forte. In Scarface we find not only a brilliant story (first told in the 30s original, but with less edge) but also a surprising amount of humor, most of it wonderfully cynical. 3: The Violence- like it or love it, the chainsaw scene and the bloodbath ending in which Tony's fallen body emits a fountain of blood formed indelible impressions in the minds of viewers. 4: The Quotabilty- (related to point 2) ""Say goodnight to the bad guy; it's the last time you're gonna see a bad guy like this"".

One of the greatest movies made,"Scarface, can be viewed with one of two attitudes.

When close attention is paid to scarface, there are more and more ideas that are expressed. One could even study how tony speaks, because the carefully chosen words express much more than you think.  One of my favorite quotes is ""i always tell the truth, even when I lie.""  I can see here where one user might call it an oxymoron and a stupid line.  I however think it means allot.

My favourite movie,"Scarface is as much a powerful drama as a fast-paced and violent action movie. The film has reached cult status and Al Pacino makes his biggest role in his career as the greedy gangster Tony Montana. On the way to power Tony Montana sacrifices both love and friendship. The viewer is torn between sympathy and condemnation, and the film touches and captivates from start to finish. A depiction of the little man who declares war on society's betrayal. A film about dreams and hopes for something better in life. A violent and epic masterpiece about a cuban refugee, and his rise and fall as a gangster in the land of opportunity. Scarface is possibly my favorite film of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
The Rise and Fall Of A Crackhead Gangster,"De Palma's 'Scarface' stands out as a landmark film in the history of pop culture. Similarly, Tony Montana is a landmark character. The story pretty much follows the rise and fall of a Cuban gangster, his greed and thirst for power and wealth. De Palma gives it a very over-the-top feel. The execution is sometimes sloppy but the ending is an example of superb filming (with great editing, cinematography, lighting and sound effect). Like a majority of the films of the 80s, 'Scarface' is a 'loud' movie that is funny and intense. Oliver Stone's solid screenplay is full of sharp dialogues. The characters are well written and even though hardly any one of them are likable, the viewer is engaged and interested to know what fate has prepared for them. Al Pacino's Tony Montana is unintentionally funny most of the time. The accent always made me laugh. At points, the character is so irritating that one wonders why his goons haven't killed him yet. Elvira's frustration is completely understandable in that regard. Yet, it is Pacino who makes this a memorable character. Michelle Pfeiffer and Steven Bauer are very competent and they shine in their parts. Over the years, 'Scarface' has earned an iconic reputation and whether you like it or not, it is worth a watch to see the kind of influence it has had on current pop culture.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"Some rise, some fall, some climb...","Certainly, how much you enjoy this movie will depend mostly on how much you enjoy Al Pacino's portrayal of Tony Montana. If you find Tony to be a bit too over the top, perhaps a caricature of 80s bad guy, then you're likely to find Scarface to be a one-dimensional, overblown piece of fluff. But if you think Tony is a major badass whose overreactions help enhance his character, not detract from it, then Scarface is your movie. The movie is still very quotable, even 36 years later! And it's educational. Never sample your own product. Good life lesson right there, kids. Anyway, I fall into the second group. Yeah, it's outlandish theater, but it somehow works - particularly as it's set in the overwhelming 1980s. Of course, fresh-off-the-boat Tony is a cocky bastard, even with the immigration guys. Of course, he blusters his way into a coke deal, which quickly goes south. Of course, he fights his way to the top of the crime game. He's all cojones; just ask him. Couple of other notes - the entire cast is a lot of fun, from Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio (playing his kid sister) and Michelle Pfeiffer (playing his wife) to Robert Loggia (his boss) and F. Murray Abraham (boss' right-hand man). Steven Bauer, playing Tony's own right-hand man, is okay, but am I the only one who sees a resemblance to Michael Ian Black? I will say that Tony's act of bulldozing over everyone and disregarding all help got a bit tiresome, but that's in keeping with his character, anyway. For me, this version of Scarface is good but not a huge classic - just a good representation of the decadent 80s from Brian DePalma.

The End Could Be Better,"Scarface tells us the story of how a cruel, ambitious and not so intellectual man can rise on top and be a drug boss. However, he cannot stay there forever because he's not intelligent enough and lacks empathy. He cannot satisfy his wife because he doesn't have anything to offer her except money and power. As he fails the things in his life, he becomes unhappy and questions that all the things he has done is for living like this. Eventually, he gets more and more lonely and aggressive and hurts everybody that he 'loves'.I think it's a good story to tell. However, I think it can be delivered better, with more dramatization and less action. Especially, the end scene is a nonsense. I think it is the worst way to end this kind of movie.I must also say that the music in this movie is very good and goes so well with the movie.

And that's the way it was!,"Scarface.  Undoubtedly one of the most entertaining movies about gangster life that was ever put on the screen.  I saw this movie when it debuted in 1983.  At that time, the Academy Awards (whom I have very little respect for) snubbed this film.  The feeling then by a lot of people was that it was not a ""politically correct film"".  It denounced and very loudly, everything it could about the government and how drugs were being brought into this country as well.  Another stone cast was about the fact that there was too much violence.  Well, there was a lot more violence being reported on the news in magazines at the time (Look, Life, etc.) than there could have ever been in a fictionalized account of a person who rose to the top with dirty money.  How many people have done this in politics?  Anyhoo, the snubbing by the Academy was aimed mostly at Oliver Stone for writing this story and Brian De Palma for directing it.  By the way, same people who voted this one out did the same thing with the Color Purple and to Steven Spielberg.  Yet another movie that moviegoes loved, but the Academy snubbed.Makes you wonder about this country.  I could tell by most of the reviews on the imdb, that most of these people were either not born or were too small to remember all the hoopla around Scarface.  Bottom line:  If a picture tells the truth, is blatant and flagrant about it and it sells a lot of tickets at the box office, it will be a flop at the Oscars.

"""All I got in this world is my balls and my word.""","Gangster fan or not, I think there's a little something for every red-blooded American in this flick, Scarface. Trying to think of just one word to describe Scarface is nearly impossible to manage. Controversial, incredible, violent, vulgar, upsetting... all too often does all of this contribute to a classic gangster movie. But Scarface pushes the envelope and brings a whole new meaning to it all.Every scene in this film is drenched in style - - whether it's blood-stained Little Havana t-shirt's worn by leading man ""Tony Montoya"" (played by Al Pacino), the Miami, Florida backdrop, or the seedy attitude of the characters in general. The acting in Scarface couldn't have been more perfectly casted, either. The legendary Al Pacino leads the gang, and he certainly leaves his mark. While the Cuban accent needs a bit more work, just about everything Pacino brought to the table was spectacular. He's one of the key reasons why people still know the name of Tony Montoya. Any other actor casted for the role would have likely been forgotten sooner or later... but not Pacino's Montoya. Steven Bauer acts as Pacino's right-hand man and best friend in Scarface, as ""Manolo"". The chemistry between these two is excellent. Bauer was practically a nobody before he came along in Scarface, which is somewhat surprising considering he comes off looking like top-notch talent with this role. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the role of Montoya's wife, and while not as easy on the eyes as in future flicks, Pfeiffer puts on a pretty good performance. Much like Bauer, she was also an upcoming actor before landing in Scarface. Little did anyone know that in ten short years she would be one of the premiere female actresses in America.Scarface's story is anything but brilliant, but it's definitely not two-dimensional. It's actually quite simple. In the early 80's, Cuban leader Fidel Castro made many Cubans leave their homeland for America. Out of the 125,000 that he sent, approximately 25,000 of them had some kind of criminal record. Among the 25,000 was Tony Montoya. Along with his friend Camolo, Montoya makes a few big hits and gets involved with some major Miami crime lords. In doing this, he goes from being broke to being a very wealthy, successful hit-man. So in short, it's your typical from rags to riches story.Even 25 years after it's unveiling, Scarface still manages to stand the test of time. I just recently watched it over, and I must say that the stuff I found to be daring and controversial years ago still remain daring and controversial today. The acting is superb and well-casted, the action and violence keep the movie going, and everything in between just adds up even further. In the end, Scarface is possibly the greatest gangster film of all time. No exaggeration required. This is a must-see for fans of The Godfather, Casino, Public Enemy, Little Caesar, or the 1932 Scarface!",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Great Movie!,"Such a very greatly made movie! Most of the characters in the movie died, though. Tony, Gina, his best friend, etc. WOW! The music of this movie was also made very nicely. I am actually looking forward to buying the soundtrack of this film. Well, we won't be seeing any more Tony Montana :( , but that's OK! And he always used to say the word ""fuck"". That got me laughing how he even said that to United States oficials and bankers. I believe Al Capino was a very great actor in this film, and it's really sad how this actually happened in the 1980s... Thousands of Cubans actually were criminals. That's very hard to believe!Michael",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

Worth A Shot For Pacino's Breathtaking Performance Alone.,"Written by Oliver Stone, directed by Brian De Palma & starring Al Pacino in the most vicious role of his career, Scarface is widely considered as a defining classic of its genre & also works as one fascinating character study but what single-handedly elevates this crime drama to a certain level of greatness is Pacino's unforgettable rendition of his character, Tony Montana.A remake of the 1932 film of the same name, Scarface tells the story of Tony Montana; a Cuban immigrant who arrives in 1980s America with nothing but then rapidly rises to become a powerful drug lord. Extremely protective of his younger sister, disowned by his mother & driven by his greed for more power, the plot covers his journey to the top & the fall that soon followed.De Palma's direction takes a raw approach in bringing Stone's screenplay to life & makes excessive use of bright colours while painting an overt portrait of 1980s Miami but its very own unrefined presentation also ends up turning the whole experience a bit cumbersome for it isn't the story but Pacino's show-stealing performance that invites the viewers into its premise & glues the film together.Camera-work is skilfully carried out & pretty much succeeds in creating an atmosphere that feels quite otherworldly. Its 170 minutes of runtime is felt on many occasions for there were moments it could've sped through or trimmed entirely but when everything clicks, it's hard to take your eyes off the screen. And then there is Giorgio Moroder's brilliant score that wonderfully integrates with its narrative.As far as performances go, Scarface is Al Pacino's show all the way. Having made a career full of terrific performances, this is where he puts every single doubt about his acting ability to rest & just like Tony Montana, announces himself as the finest actor of his era. His work here is so intimidating that it overshadows every other aspect of the picture. And he's excellently supported by Michelle Pfeiffer & others who chip in with fine contributions.On an overall scale, Scarface may not have lived up to its strong legacy purely from a storytelling perspective but its massive cult following is understandable. Covering themes of greed, addiction & power, bringing on screen its brutal take on American dream, and wrapping itself up on a high with what's easily one of cinema's most explosive finales, Scarface presents itself as what it is, without pretending or sugarcoating, and is worth a shot for Pacino's acting alone for it made Tony Montana truly immortal in the annals of cinema.",,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Say Hello to My Little Friend (No Spoilers),"I've always been told this was an important film for Pacino (even though I still think it was the Godfather Trilogy that set him up for most of his future roles) and was finally able to watch it all the way through. A modern-day morality tale based on real issues from the overlapping 1980s crises. In many ways it picks up on a storyline that the Godfather Trilogy was poking at repeatedly. An interesting appearance by Michelle Pfeiffer, who is normally the OCD/peppy/creative lead in the movies in which she plays a more prominent role. It's interesting to see where Pacino's character (Tony) feels he should draw the line in terms of moral behavior. If you haven't seen the film yet, be ready for a few surprises, and the zillion scenes involving pools (no spoilers), but there are also a few predictable parts in my opinion (again, no spoilers).",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
"An ultra-violent, ultra-entertaining gangster classic","While other famous titles might first come to mind when thinking of classic gangster/mafia films, 'Scarface' might well have a claim to being the most brutal, over the top and relentlessly violent gangster film ever made. For pure entertainment value I can't think of many better. This film is a total blast, a hugely entertaining piece of cinema and one of the few three hour long films that seems to fly by.If there's one area in which 'Scarface' is lacking, however, it has to be the rather generic and predictable plot. The focus in this film is very much on the action and violence and, at times, it feels like the plot isn't given much thought, or at least it isn't the priority. That takes nothing away from the enjoyment of 'Scarface' though, which is a true gangster classic and unquestionably one of the best films of the 80s.",8.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

One of the crime movies for all times,"""Scarface"" is one of those must see films that everyone who loves crime thrillers needs to see, if only for the intense character portrait of crime. This three hour gore fest tells the tale of Cuban refugee Tony Montana, who rises through the ranks of a crime syndicate until he is the reigning king of the drug scene in eighties' Miami. What fascinates viewers is the fragility of the organization, and how fraught with violence the film is, initially putting a lot of people off. Tony only gets as far as he does because he trusts no one, is only out for himself, and revels in the blood and cocaine madness of his empire. While he comes to the United States bedraggled and full of vinegar, he slowly morphs into an opportunistic henchman, happy to be seen as the working man, oblivious to the death and destruction of his actions, and jealous of everyone and everything that stands in his way. He is our protagonist but he is also our villain, so bloodthirsty and autonomous that it's pretty frightening to think he holds most of the power. Though Tony breaks down doors in order to become the king, he also steps on a lot of people to get there, so it's obvious that his world will crumble around him quickly. The casting is perfect for this film. Pacino portrays an embittered, hate-filled Montagna, which makes for a volatile performance. Michelle Pfeiffer stars as the prize that he longs to grasp within his claws, while being both frigidly cold and hopelessly angry, making for a great dynamic between the two characters. Besides this film being great in its realistic depiction of a drug enterprise, it's also a great crime film. The seventies and eighties were rife with stories of kingpins and gangsters, but this is the first that shows the arrogance and self-indulgence of cocaine, and its place in real life 1980s Miami. This film both demonizes the exploits of its lead while also showing the extravagance that crime comes with, and that's an intense balance to find. Brian de Palma masters this balance by showing the motivations of the character, and the lengths he is willing to go to find success in his adopted country. That's why this film stands the test of time, and illustrates the grandiosity of the drug trade in full.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A Flawed Masterpiece,"I don't know if ""Scarface"" is director Brian De Palma's best movie or not but it certainly contains the best scene he ever filmed. (It's the chainsaw scene, by the way.) De Palma has a bunch of terrific visuals and gets knockout performances out of his entire cast. Al Pacino gives a career defining performance. He's terrific. The only thing that's not great about Pacino's performance is his wig. It's pretty bad and becomes a semi-distraction at times. As great as it is, ""Scarface"" isn't perfect. It's length is a bit of a problem. Clocking in at almost three hours is a bit much. Two and a half hours would have made this terrific movie even better.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
A fantastic journey,"This movie is simply an epic masterpiece. It is one of those films that will be remembered and imitated for years to come, it has a huge following still, over twenty years later and has influenced some of the greatest movies since then.

Al Pacino is loud and intense in this movie, displaying one of the most famous accents in movie history, and he does it masterfully. The supporting cast is very talented, with Steven Bauer as his right hand man and best friend.The overall feel to this movie is extremely dramatic, some could say over the top.

He really knows how to bring a character to life, and a character this big is worth seeing. Scarface is not a movie that is non stop shooting or 'all talk no action'. It is evenly spread out, and that's what makes the movie perfect. The fact that it is not focused entirely on the lives of those in drug trafficking, but also what their loved ones go through almost gives viewers an insight into the paranoia and danger these fearless people go through everyday of their lives and proves all the money and power can't always bring all the happiness and security.",9.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"This Movie Is Pretty Good On It's Own, But Compared To The Original It's A Disgrace","This movie is pretty good when taken alone. But compared to the original, it is a disgrace. The original is the best gangster film of all time, and one of the best films of all time. It was a monumental work of art that made movie history. This one does little to stay true to the original, it completely changes everything. In fact it barely pays homage to it, to the point where it actually overwrote the original and caused it to be forgotten about, which is just a travesty, making it not so much a remake, but stealing.The original was so much better than this one, this one pales in comparison. The original is a classic work of art, this one is a vapid superficial action film. The original was about al capone. This one isn't about any historical gangster, just some cuban. The original was about prohibition during the roaring 20's. This one is about cocaine during the 80's. The original is about the art of film and the darkness of mafia culture. This one is about pop culture and how cool a badass gangster can be made to look.Now I am not saying that this is a bad film. I'm just trying to bring awareness to the fact that it is just a remake of one of the great classics which happens to be one of the best (the best in my opinion) films of all time. And that it is nothing in comparison to the original, which unfortunately most people haven't even heard of, even lovers of this one.

Like being chainsawed,"A candidate for the most overrated movie of the 80s? Scarface is regularly described as visceral, involving and, above all, influential, but watching it is like sitting through one of those straight-to-VHS action flicks with people like C. Thomas Howell and Frank Stallone.OK - the good stuff first. Pacino is watchable, as he always was before he made Scent Of A Woman. Robert Loggia's quietly effective. And the sets are impressively garish.But there's so much else wrong, and the movie just doesn't convince. Maybe it's because hardly any real Cubans would touch the script, and most of the lead roles went to Italian-Americans (with the exception of, er, F. Murray Abraham). It feels like a Mafia movie (Godfather I & II being the obvious comparisons) done on the cheap.The music is utterly dreadful, especially those unintentionally hilarious stabs when Tony gets jealous about his sister (a character introduced far too late to make psychological sense). Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio is weak, not helped by silly hair and mauve underwear.Some of the set pieces are incompetently executed - during the riot at the holding camp, during which Tony carries out his first hit, I'm convinced some of the extras are giggling. The disco sequences are like something out of a Jackie Collins movie, or, worse, Basic Instinct. Lots of Caucasians fulfilling stereotypes. Luckily nobody is wearing a Michael Douglas-style v-neck, but it's close.As for the idea that it was influential, sure. On Miami Vice, and that was naff as well.",3.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"Sleazy, Gross, Disgusting, Sick, Vile, Putrid, Ugly, Repulsive, Repugnant, Trashy, and Just Generally Unpleasant and Nasty","So why the high rating? There are plenty of reasons to hate this movie: the glorification of violence; the unbelievably misogynistic treatment of women; Al Pacino's patently unconvincing Cuban accent; Giorgio Moroder's music (actually, the pulse-pounding score itself is great, but those early-80s power ballads are worth a few giggles); the stereotyping of Cubans and Colombians. But the violence in this movie really is undeniably beautiful; the women aren't treated any worse than in any other gangster film; Pacino is inspired, clumsy accent notwithstanding, and it's glorious to see him really let it all out (in a performance that I believe he calls his favorite); Moroder's music adds to the outrageousness of the proceedings; and the stereotyping, well... bad on De Palma, but what can I say? This is one terrific story, and it's certainly told well.While the hip-hop ""community"" has chosen to read the film as a morality play for aspiring kingpins, it is in my opinion a satire of capitalism, which ideal is embodied by Tony Montana (Pacino), a bloodthirsty, cocaine-addled killing machine who kills at the slightest provocation. But his violent temper hides a lightning-quick instinct for business, danger, and provocation. It is through this mixture of brutality and brilliance that Tony is able to climb to the top of an utterly corrupt empire, bathing his hands in blood and laughing all the way to the bank. He is a coward and a criminal, but even he knows that he's ultimately no different than any other man of power. He's a businessman, plain and simple. If he had born into an affluent American family, Tony Montana might have been a lawyer or politician. Though public figures (especially political figures) damn Tony's actions for the cameras, they know and Tony knows that he is the purest embodiment of the American Dream. If the American Dream is to prosper in order to ensure comfort, safety, and freedom, then Tony is one of the greatest Americans to ever live. This is the cynical message at the heart of De Palma's film; compare that to the slightly more idealistic message at the core of Howard Hawks' equally great 1932 original, SCARFACE, THE SHAME OF THE NATION.The film starts with Castro opening Mariel harbor and ejecting the ""undesirables"" from Cuba. One of these refugees is charming ex-convict and live wire Tony Montana. Together with his best friend and partner in crime, Manny Ribera, Tony works his way up from the streets of Miami to the seaside mansions of criminal high society. Along the way, the two friends learn how to live the high life, but they quickly discover that the money and power come with a price (don't they always?). Michelle Pfeiffer is Tony's disenfranchised wife, Robert Loggia his early boss and mentor, Harris Yulin a crooked cop, and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio his beautiful sister, who idolizes him, and for whom he obviously harbors incestuous feelings. The climax of this film is a tour-de-force, and the photography of the great John A. Alonzo (CHINATOWN, HAROLD AND MAUDE, BLACK Sunday) is outstanding, as are the sets and costumes. Every single scene is an eye-grabbing explosion of gorgeous ultra-80s decadence. Overall, SCARFACE is a masterpiece of suspense and social commentary. It deserves a place among the greatest gangster films of all time. Not until THE UNTOUCHABLES would De Palma top this one.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Vastly Overrated,"Just because a film has its poster in every college dorm room and is quoted incessantly doesn't make it good.While there's a cult status surrounding this film, it has little do with anything interesting.  Instead...it's due to gratiutious violence, drug use, and a few catchy lines.Scarface is over the top in nearly every aspect.  Ridiculously long, filled with overacting, flashy, huge sets, and unnecessary camera wowing (a DePalma speciality).  As far as this being a classic or even good...I just don't see it.A very run-of-the-mill story lengthened to over 3 hours of bloodsplattering and F-bombs.If you thirst for Gangster films that are 3+ hours long see Once Upon A Time in America, The Godfather Pt. 2, or an entire season of Sopranos.

Great Film........,"It took me three sittings to watch this film, I don't personally like it. But don't let that deter you. It is one of the best films I have seen.It couldn't have gone wrong, really, when you have the mix of Brian de Palma directing, Oliver Stone writing, and of course Al Pacino acting (and throw in there Michelle Pfeiffer to sell it further). It delivers on direction, with that unmistakable retro look, and cinematography was great at times. The acting was great from start to finish, Al Pacino sells his Cuban character really well (that's an understatement) and supporting actors do a fantastic job, too. The set designs and the locations, as well as the music, really do a great job in bringing the story to reality. It is amazing how the film, with all these sets and all the big names, was made for only $25 mil. I like to think, for that reason, that it is slightly art-house (you can argue with me there) in that its concept and quality really strays from the typical Hollywood film we know today (if you compare the calibre of films Hollywood made in the 70s and 80s, and the different types of film we see in today's Hollywood you'll notice the artistic difference (again; you can argue that)). Its box office receipts do reflect this, and so the budget was perfectly set to set the film up to make a profit.The script is where I start to be divided. On one hand it is fantastic; elements of the American Dream are strong, and the character development of all the key characters is brilliant! The realism in each characters lines is priceless. The only quibble I have with the script is that I found it to be quite formulaic. I thought for the caliber of film it is the script could have taken a chance and branched out from the typical plot structure and realised a greater artistic appeal (with albeit a lesser commercial appeal). When you compare it to the Godfather I & II for example, the difference and quality of plot structure is quite evident. (Granted, the Godfather films were based on books, and these films' particular religious adherence to the books makes its plot structure more appealing, and is one of its greatest selling points.)For me, the formulaic script was an annoyance which slightly flawed the whole film. However, I am definitely the minority on this point, and I stress that with every other facet of Scarface, it is a high quality and entertaining film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"
Tides of greed.,"One of my favorite films of all time.Tony Montana and his friend Manny have come to Miami from Cuba as political refugees in the early '80's....to take over the cocaine empire and rule the world. Quite simply, the story is about greed, excess, power, and violence....ahhh the American Dream.Al Pacino pulls out all his skills and gives his performance of his lifetime here, he becomes Tony Montana, literally. Quite simply, one of the best acting performances I've seen, if not the very best. How he nailed that accent is a mystery to me, and while it's convincing, it's also completely hilarious! There are more quotable lines for this film than any film, period. How some people do not enjoy Pacino in this film completely baffles me, although much of the discontent for this film comes from the fact that he has an accent, and I think some just have a hard time getting used to it. Without the accent, I don't believe I'd like it as much. He's just one bad mofo.The story itself is fairly simple, rising to the top can be just as fast as dropping to the bottom. And even everything in the world can't make some people happy, when by all rights it should. Filmed in the '80's, it is unmistakably hard to ignore. The clothes, music and cars have the decade of excess written all over them, which is perfect for this film in particular. And just like the '80's themselves, Scarface screams of excess as Tony quickly rises to the top of the drug empire. No one stays on top forever.Although not a mob movie, one of the best damn gangster movies made. Ridiculously highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Crime, Drama"

"A long, outrageously extravagant, bloody, drug fuelled 80s celebration of cinema.","SCARFACE (1983)Scarface is now an iconic film. Al Pacino received wide recognition for his portrayal of power hungry Tony Montana, but this was not the case in 1983. Scarface was met with mixed reviews and Pacino's performance was criticised as 'over the top'. I can see why many critics did not like Scarface: it's over the top, it's weak on the storyline, it's perhaps repetitive at times and it's 170 minutes long.Scarface is not a masterpiece, but it is an iconic film.
