A perfect romantic comedy,"`Annie Hall', long thought to be Woody Allen's opus, is perhaps a perfect romantic comedy because it not only shows the happy, touching moments of relationships, but also displays the reality of coupling  the occasional waning of interest in one another, the hypercritical moments, etc.  It is absolutely brilliantly written; Woody Allen exhibits his usual dry humor and self-deprecation, but also his sensitive, passionate and romantic side.  It was because of this film that I fell in love with Woody Allen at the age of twelve (take your cheap shot here) and almost twenty years later he still is that intellectual, bookish and humorous ideal.  Diane Keaton was his muse and co-star for this film, and they are perfect counterparts  so much so that their interaction onscreen doesn't seem like viewing two actors in a film, but is a much more voyeuristic experience.  Watching `Annie Hall' is like sitting at a bistro table and observing another couple a few tables away, and that is just one of the elements that make this film so endearing. Most people can relate to at least some aspects of Alvy and Annie's relationship, which helps make this film a timeless one.However, `Annie Hall' is not just a good romantic comedy; it is a film that engages some unusual storytelling techniques.  Actors speak directly to the audience, characters interact with strangers on the street who just happen to know the answers to the personal questions posed, there is a brief animation scene, etc.  While none of these approaches were new in 1977, their execution was inspired.  `Annie Hall' is like a fond memory, or a favorite old song  anytime I have discussed this film with others their smiling expressions are usually tinged with a hint of nostalgia, because one can look back on either their past or current relationship and do what precious few films allow us to do  relate on a personal level.--Shelly",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I Forgot My Mantra....,"Woody Allen's seminal 1977 romantic comedy ""Annie Hall"" is not only laugh-out-loud funny (with some of the most quotable dialogue ever written for the screen...this is the ""Casablanca"" of comedies, folks) but also sweet and charming (due in large part because of Diane Keaton's smashing performance as the title character, the flighty singer from Wisconsin with a quirky fashion sense and ""neat"" outlook on life) without ever turning trite or sappy like so many romantic comedies tend to do. Allen wisely deconstructed the genre with his non-linear story-line (something that was later done to even greater effect with a more recent and profound look at relationships, ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"") and charming little theatrical tricks like talking to the audience or pulling extras into the scene for their opinions on what's been going on. It keeps the viewer off guard and allows for a free flow of comedic and philosophical ideas that might otherwise not have found their way into a more traditional film.In his latter years, Allen's best work has been when he is not part of the cast (my personal favorites being ""Bulletts over Broadway,"" ""Sweet and Lowdown,"" and the recent ""Match Point""). ""Annie Hall"" was made in his heyday when he could still pull off playing a neurotic New York Jewish comedienne with charm and panache. There's something innocent and benign about his obsessions here, as this was long before the Woody/Soon-Yi fiasco and the days of grossly miscasting himself against younger female co-stars. Yes, Mr. Allen has been artsier (witness ""Manhattan"") and more satirical (witness ""Zelig"") but here, with Diane Keaton as his muse, he was never more charming or funnier.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""That was the most fun I've ever had without laughing""","Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is something of a hopeless romantic. A cynical, death-obsessed New York Jewish comedian, Singer has never been able to maintain a steady relationship with a woman. He has been married twice, and divorced twice. He broke up with one woman because of their disagreements over the ""second shooter"" conspiracy of John F. Kennedy's assassination, or perhaps that was just his excuse. To paraphrase Freud, possibly Groucho Marx, he simply ""would never want to belong to any club that would accept someone like him for a member."" He doesn't drive because he is paranoid about driving; he has been seeing a psychiatrist for the past fifteen years, though these appointments were long ago reduced to simple ""whining"" sessions. There is an inherent uncertainty in everything that Singer says  as though he really knows what he's talking about, but he can't convince himself that he's got it right.When he accompanies a friend (Tony Roberts) to a tennis game, Singer's first and foremost concern is that the club will deny him entry because he's a Jew. However, that fateful game serves forth something so much more significant and life-changing  he comes to meet the ditsy and exuberant Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). Despite clearly having very little in common, something clicks between the two eligibles, and they embark on a tumultuous years-long relationship that will inevitably fail to materialise into anything further. Erupting with clever dialogue and witty cultural references, 'Annie Hall's' script is one of the best you'll ever see. Not only is the conversation entertaining to listen to, but  even with all the talking to the camera and interacting with random extras  it actually manages to seem startlingly realistic. This is no small thanks, of course, to the main actors, who embody their characters so perfectly that we're unsure if they are acting or merely playing themselves.Though he had previously released a few well-received, light-hearted affairs, it was 'Annie Hall' that blasted writer/actor/director Woody Allen into the realms of super-stardom. In an uncharacteristic move for the Academy, Allen's film won four 1978 Oscars, including Best Actress (Keaton), Best Original Screenplay (Allen, Marshall Brickman), Best Director (Allen) and Best Picture  not undeservedly, though millions of 'Star Wars' fans would, I'm sure, disagree. Having revisited 'Annie Hall' for the first time in a year, having since enjoyed many of Allen's other films, I am genuinely amazed at his transition from silly comedian to insightful observer on human relationships. Of course, a noticeable evolution in his film-making style is evident in both the science-fiction 'Sleeper (1973)' and the Russian historical spoof 'Love and Death (1975),' but neither boasts the the intelligence nor the sophistication of this film, which wholly discards the Chaplin-like slapstick of Allen's previous films and adopts the Tracy-Hepburn screwball comedy of a decade later.Originally slated  and filmed, in fact  as a New York murder mystery with a romantic sub-plot, 'Annie Hall' was taken by editor Ralph Rosenbaum and cut down (massacred, if you will) into the modern, witty 1970s screwball comedy that we still enjoy today. It is truly amazing that such an extensive post-production reshaping had no obvious ill effects upon the general flow of the film, though the structure in itself is so hectic that we probably wouldn't notice it, anyway: Allen frequently cuts forwards and backwards in time, his modern characters are able to revisit and discuss the past, characters in split screens interact, Allen regularly breaks the ""fourth wall"" and addresses the audience directly. Some of the discarded murder mystery elements from 'Annie Hall' were later incorporated into another Allen film, 'Manhattan Murder Mystery (1993),' which also co-starred Keaton.Aside from Allen and Keaton, numerous smaller roles provide a crucial framework for the overall structure of the film. Tony Roberts is Rob, Singer's old friend and confidant. Paul Simon (of Simon and Garfunkel) plays a record producer who takes a keen interest in both Annie and her singing. Shelley Duvall is a reporter for 'The Rolling Stone' magazine, and a one-time girlfriend of Singer. There are also tiny early roles for Christopher Walken (as Annie's somewhat disturbed brother), Jeff Goldblum (who speaks one memorable line at a party  ""Hello? I forgot my mantra"") and Sigourney Weaver (who can be briefly glimpsed as Singer's date outside a theatre). Two slightly more unusual cameos come from Truman Capote (as a Truman Capote-lookalike, no less) and scholar Marshall McLuhan (whom Singer suddenly procures from behind a movie poster to declare to a talkative film-goer that ""you know nothing of my work!"").Easily the most innovative and energetic of the films I've so far seen from Woody Allen, 'Annie Hall' is a spirited glimpse at the incompatibility of human beings, and a cynical yet bittersweet meditation on the falsity of the perfect romantic Hollywood ending. It is also a considerable comedic achievement, and Allen would repeatedly recycle his trademark neurotic New Yorker screen persona, most notably in 'Manhattan (1979),' but never with more success than this premium outing in excellence. The engagingly-convoluted storyline moves with such briskness that you don't realise just how very little happens, and that, by the film's end, our characters are exactly where they were at the beginning. Nevertheless, Allen manages to say something significant about human relationships  they're totally irrational, crazy and absurd, but we keep attempting them because of what they give us in return. Or, at least, what we think they give us.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Allen's best, and one of the best films ever.","The film that bested Star Wars for the 1977 Best Picture Oscar, Annie Hall is a remarkable achievement in filmmaking that transcends its simple, romantic premise to create a stunning portrait of not only 70's pop culture, but of human nature cumulative.  Directed and co-written by Woody Allen, who has since directed other gems such as Hannah and Her Sisters and The Purple Rose of Cairo, Annie Hall also stars Allen as Alvy Singer, a neurotic, death-obsessed comedian who seems unlucky in love and life.  That is until he meets Annie, brilliantly played by Diane Keaton, who is beautiful, fashion-savvy, carefree (she likes using expressions like `la di da'), and a terrible driver.Annie and Alvy's relationship is an unlikely one.  She's a Midwestern girl, straight out of white-bread Wisconsin; he's a life-long New York Jew who grew up (literally) under the Coney Island roller coaster.  He's been seeing a therapist for the past 16 years; she only `needs' one once she meets him. She's an extroverted aspiring singer; he's an introverted, world-despising imp.  Yet Allen and Keaton are so perfect in their roles, they improbably make this couple one of the most memorable ever.The plot revolves around Alvy's chronicles of loves lost and a retrospective on his relationship with Annie, with whom he has since parted ways.  At the end of the film, we see Alvy try his hand at stage-writing-he writes a play about his relationship with Annie, but gives it a happy ending.  Yes, Annie and Alvy don't have a fairy tale ending to their relationship, but Alvy certainly wishes they had, even though he learns to live with the acknowledgment it has failed.The best part of Annie Hall is its incredible screenplay-the best ever to be written.  Not a word is wasted nor a line unquotable.  Except here, while Allen's early films had thrived on streams of one-liners, Allen doesn't go for cheap laughs-each line is simultaneously hilarious and poignant. Everything is part of a greater whole.  We laugh because it's funny, but there's a greater dynamic at work in Annie Hall.  This is a story not exclusively about a relationship between two people, but also a musing on 70's politics, drugs, East Coast/West Coast rivalry, narcissism, religion, celebrity, and several other topics with which Allen deals with extraordinary ease.Yet Annie Hall would not be among my favorite films of all-time if it were just Woody Allen ranting and raving about what he likes and dislikes. There are other Allen films that serve that purpose, i.e. Deconstructing Harry, and they're not nearly as good.  What separates Annie Hall is its grace, the believable chemistry between Keaton and Allen, the unique direction (ranging from split-screens to cartoon imagery to on-screen subtitles of what the actors are thinking), but mostly because it's the rare film to find a perfect balance between sheer entertainment, humor, and poignancy.When the dust had settled, Diane Keaton deservedly won an Academy Award for her performance, Allen took home Oscars for direction and writing, and the film beat out Star Wars for Best Picture, which most people consider a complete sham.  Evidently, those people didn't see Annie Hall, for if they had, they'd recognize that the acting, writing, and even the direction in Star Wars can't hold a candle to Annie Hall, one of the best films ever made.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A wonderfully modern romance,"Woody Allen's masterpiece will always be ""Annie Hall.""  What is most remarkable today about this film is the way Allen presents it.  It's a movie about a relationship.  But rather than taking a linear approach, Allen plays with time.  We see the middle, the begining, and the end. And not always in that order.  Allen also breaks the fourth wall a lot and has many dream sequences and asides which add to the complexity of the characters.  This is a highly autobiographical film and Allen pulls no punches.  This movie is not about romance in the way that ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" is.  Rather, ""Annie Hall"" is a deconstruction of a romance.  At times it is funny and heartbreaking and always classic.  ""Love fades,"" indeed.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Witty and Charming, one of Allen's greatest achievements.","Annie Hall is a movie about life.  In recent films, there are fairly predictable endings.  (i.e. guy gets girl after chase scene in Manhattan). Annie Hall goes against the grain of movies.  There is definite chemistry between Allen and Keaton.  That is one of the main reasons this movie is successful.  Alvy and Annie do not have high wage jobs, they do not go clubbing, nor are they incredibly attractive.  Why does a movie character relationship have to be so extreme it's unconvincing?  These days movie producers create plots that are unbelievable.  They don't have any depth and usually have shallow intentions.  You can sense that the two leads care for each other.  The situations in this movie resemble real life and that is why it is so critically acclaimed and remembered. Sure Woody talked into the camera, but that, in a sense is real life as well.  It reminds me of my usual thought process and how when I think; I feel as though I'm presenting my thoughts to myself.  Only he is, presenting it to us.   This movie is clever and thought provoking.  If you're looking for the opposite of a yearly run of the mill movie, this is for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen Just Doesn't Do It For Me.,"If this is considered Allen's magnum opus...I'm just not sure where to go from here...because whereas I can dig this style of anti-romantic comedy...it's his particular brand of humour that just doesn't do it for me.With that being said, I fully appreciate the structure of the film.The connection and transitions between vignettes, the breaking of the the fourth wall (by addressing the audience through the camera), the creative use of subtitles (that provide us a glimpse into the underlying thoughts of the characters while they have a conversation where they otherwise pander to each other's expectations)...all very clever.I also love all the movie and literary references he manages to weave in.And all the locations- from both New York and LA- that he incorporates into the film.But his brand of humour just doesn't swing it for me.It just comes off as bland and unrewarding, and leaves me unfulfilled.But, perhaps, that is what he was going for...awkward humour, from an awkward man, making an awkward picture, about his awkward relationships.Am i just missing the brilliance?Probably.But I can't help but feel how I feel about it.I will admit, I was entertained by the film itself, even if the characters- and their sense of humour- turned me off.So maybe I shouldn't throw Allen under the bus (despite the criticisms that society has directed at him since), without giving some of his other films a shot.I will probably, at least, watch Bananas, Sleeper, and Manhattan going forward.But I will certainly be going into those with much lower expectations than I had here.Because, despite it's reputation as ""the best New York based romantic comedy ever made"" (Breakfast At Tiffany's is better, in my opinion)...I don't understand how it won 4 oscars (perhaps it was a slow year...).It's certainly not a bad film, by any metric...it's just not my kind of film.But maybe it's one of those things that has to grow on you, over time (despite Allen clearly having the opposite effect on every woman he's ever met).6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Alvy and Annie,"Woody Allen's masterpiece with favorite co-star Diane Keaton has Allen casting himself as New York born comedian Alvy Singer and his relationship with Keaton

his time psychoanalyzing himself and all around him. He can't make any
relationship permanent.Along comes Keaton and it looks like this is the one, but there's always pitfalls
when you deal with a walking neurosis like Allen.Both Woody and Diane fit so naturally in their parts you think you are peeking
in on a home movie. Annie Hall won for Best Picture, Best Actress for Diane
Keaton, and Best Director and Best Original Screenplay for Woody Allen. Best
in the supporting cast is Tony Roberts as Allen's sidekick actor buddy.This really is a timeless classic. It's humor has no temporal limits. Annie Hall

"Woody Allen at His Best, Funniest and Most Interesting.","""Annie Hall"" is a brilliant romantic comedy that could have only been made by Woody Allen (Oscar-winning in directing and writing, nominated in acting). Allen stars as a Jewish stand-up comic who falls in love with aspiring actress Diane Keaton (in a well-deserved Oscar-winning turn as the titled character). Their relationship is explored throughout the course of the film in a gentle and warm-hearted way. Allen's unique views and brand of humor are prevalent from start to finish and the film is clearly made in the 1970s as many issues from that time period are explored as the film progresses. ""Annie Hall"" is simple in many ways, but deals with romantic issues in complex ways and the film is just so intelligent that it is near impossible to dislike. Woody Allen is brilliant as he usually is. Diane Keaton hit super-stardom as well with her role. The supporting cast includes the likes of Carol Kane, Shelley Duvall, Tony Roberts, Christopher Walken and Colleen Dewhurst. Look for an unknown Jeff Goldblum as an extra during the Los Angeles sequence. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Romance
"The film where Woody Allen found his own voice, and one of his best ever films","Not everybody will love Woody Allen's humour, some will find him interesting and sharply insightful while others will find him self-indulgent. With me, it veers very largely towards the former with some occasions where the latter does creep in. Annie Hall is one of his best films, a masterpiece and one of the better Best Picture winners of the 70s with only the two Godfather films even better. The best assets are the script and the chemistry between the two leads. The script is enormously witty, with cracking dialogue that induces one and at times more laughs a minute, and full of insightful observations. People have deemed it one of the best screenplays of all time, and from personal perspective there is no reason to argue. The chemistry between the two leads, running somewhat on a parallel between the relationship of Woody Allen and Diane Keaton itself, and the actors in general actually is throughout very believable. It is often adorable and often dynamic. It helps that Diane Keaton gives one of her best and most endearing performances, and while Alvy is not a particularly likable or sympathetic character Woody Allen is similarly great, his looking into the camera and breaking the fourth wall moments were funny. The supporting cast all give spirited performances, especially Tony Roberts, Paul Simon, Carol Kane and Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum is memorable as well for one of the film's best and most quotable lines. The romance is sweet and relateable, the ending for me was really moving, but the story doesn't depend on that alone, Allen also muses over topics that were relevant then and that we can see as relevant today as well, he does so in a very thoughtful way. Allen directs with assurance, and while there have been more visually audacious Woody Allen films since Annie Hall it is still cleverly made with the way it's shot, the cartoon images and how we're shown visually what the characters are thinking. There is no music score and in this case that was a good idea, there was more leeway for the relationship between the two lead characters and observations to speak, and that's the same for the deliberate but never tedious pacing. Overall, an outstanding film, one of Allen's best and one of the greatest films of the 70s. People may dislike it for it winning Best Picture over Star Wars(this viewers and many others however think it fully deserved the win), as much as I'll have a fondness for the Star Wars original trilogy and consider it a milestone of its genre it is easy to see out of Star Wars and Annie Hall which is the superior film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of Woody's best!,"Okay, Woody Allen could be annoying sometimes and is heavily neurotic even in this film which he wrote and directed. The film is somewhat autobiographical about his relationships with a WASP woman named Annie Hall played by Diane Keaton in her Oscar winning role. Woody plays himself in the film even with a different name. Even though it's a short film, the story moves quickly and you have to be alert for some of the humor about the relationship between men and women. The supporting cast includes Tony Roberts, Paul Simon, Carol Kane and others. Woody's hatred of Los Angeles and all things Californian is well-known and documented. He is out of touch when he is away from New York City where he is equally neurotic. As a couple at first, Woody and Annie get along great but slowly Woody's own negativity creeps into the relationship. Annie starts seeing a therapist and their relationship unravels.

It didn't interest me, and it didn't make me laugh. Finding it hard to like his character made it hard for me to appreciate this movie. The movie was well thought out though.

The Story about the Story,"Woody is an intelligent man who worries about the issues of film-making. The primary concern, the very first problem, is always to decide what the relationships are among the audience, the camera, the narrator if any, and the characters.Woody was on his way to making a murder mystery, which is the purest form of messing about with these relationships. In a much studied decision, they decided to cut out all the mystery and just focus on the context. In this case, that context is a richly layered evocation of a relationship. I really wish I could see the original film to discover the mysteries Woody intended to hide in the folds.And the folds are as numerous and complex as they can get. We have a framing device where Woody speaks to us partly as a conversation which blends into a standup, which is mirrored as a part of the story. We have timeshifting where we move back and forth in time in a simple 'Tarantino' way; but we go way past: characters from the 'present' enter the past as Dickensian ghosts, then they talk to characters in the past. we have characters in different pasts talking to each other via split screen. We have a layering of Woody and Diane's relationship in real life, then the film, then TWO films within: a play which is part of the action and a cartoon which is the action itself.More: we have Woody talking to the audience as if we were shifted into the play -- early in that play we are introduced to Bergman and Fellini: in both cases while they are waiting outside. These are the two inventors of folded narrative. Even more: while some bozo perfessor spouts off about Fellini and McLuhan, Woody enlists the audience to challenge him and drags out McLuhan himself! The joke of course is that McLuhan himself was a vapid weaver of lowbrow theories.And more and more with the constant weaving of 'analysis' and other film-like activities: singers, photographers, TeeVee stars, models...This period was when he was first exposed to Wallace Shawn who was hanging out with Terrence Malick, two other innovators in narrative folding. All the 'New Yorker' stuff means more when you know Shawn's father was the long-time editor of that publication and defined the self-absorbed reflection that characterizes the city and this film.Keaton's manner was essential to pulling this off, someone who could pull off the story about her uncle dying while waiting for a Turkey. Watch her.. she is clued in to simultaneously being in herself (Keaton), herself (Hall), inside the story she is telling and inside the story Woody is telling. She shifts and guffaws just as if she were stoned and moving among realities, just as her character.Just amazing and intelligent. Will we ever see this the way it was written and shot? Or is that mystery too intelligent for us, who prefer to think of this as a funny, endearing love story.",,Anonymous,Romance
Defines Modern Romantic Comedy Genre. #4 Greatest Comedy Film 💯,"'Annie Hall' (1977) is the pinnacle of Woody Allen's own style of romantic comedy film-making that he refined starting with 'Play It Again Sam' five years earlier in 1972, picking up pacing and editing style cues from that film's Director Herb Ross, one of his many film making influences that included Ingmar Bergman.Allen's most popular and endearing film, Annie Hall is a truly iconic 1970s film. At least partly autobiographical, the story integrates Allen's and Keaton's real-life off-screen love relationship (and individual neurosis) into the story. The connection with the audiences of that period was huge - Keaton's character styling even created a wildly popular fashion style ""the Annie Hall Look"".Annie Hall is a ""must-see"" film, and sits on many Top 100 Greatest Films lists for good reason - it is Allen's greatest and most important film, #4 on my ""Top 10 Greatest Comedy Films"" list (1960-Present).There is simply no comedy film Director/Screenwriter that does this narrated story telling form better in the comedy genre than Woody Allen. Frank Capra was witty and humorous, but Allen keeps the comedy on equal or greater ground than the drama (tied to complex relationships and personalities, focusing on the protagonist's inner angst).Allen resides atop the genre he evolved and redefined for 5 decades, influencing film-makers/screen-writers like Judd Apatow, Charlie Kaufman, Wes Andersen, and the Coen Brothers, making Woody Allen one of the most influential and important film makers.He also established the interstate highway for stand-up comics to make the jump to hyper-space of serious oscar-worthy acting, opening the flood gates for comics like Tom Hanks, Robin Williams, Michael Keaton, and many others.Must See - Highly Recommended👍👍",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Definitive Woody Allen Movie,"I am not a huge fan of Woody Allen and my wife can't hardly stand to watch him. As a result, I have only seen a half-dozen of Woody Allen movies.

Woody's use of the aside (talking to the audience), is a little distracting, but the short scene with Marshall McLuhan was a wonderful shot at self-absorbed intellectuals.The plot idea is very good. I think so many of Woody Allen's characters in so many of his movies have been this same character over and over again. I think this is the definitive Woody Allen character.

The perfect screenplay,"Woody isn't much of an actor except when he plays himself, but he is an occasionally brilliant writer. He and Marshall Brickman collaborated on Annie Hall, which may be the best screenplay ever written. There is not one wasted word in the whole script. Perhaps the greatest gag ever was when Woody produces Marshall McLuhan out of a movie line to contradict a loud-mouth Columbia College professor standing behind him. ""If real life could only be like this."" In addition, the separation of spirit from body was a brilliant gag, and nobody can cook a lobster like Alvie. The cinematography is gorgeous and the performances are splendiforous. La Di Da, La Di Da. This is not my favorite Woody Allen movie (Love and Death takes that honor), but it was his best. The Academy took a lot of flak for the Oscar nod, but I couldn't imagine a world where Woody did not win an Oscar. This was his Oscar-worthy movie. Unfortunately, he has fallen short of duplicating this high level of film-making ever since.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A relationship, I think, is like a shark. It has to constantly move forward or it dies. And I think what we got on our hands is a dead shark.","Annie Hall is directed by Woody Allen who also stars and co-writes the screenplay with Marshall Brickman. Cast alongside Allen is Diane Keaton, Tony Roberts, Carol Kane, Paul Simon, Shelley Duvall, Christopher Walken and Colleen Dewhurst.Alvy Singer (Allen) investigates the reasons why his relationship with Annie Hall (Keaton) failed.It's just not for me! This film I mean. I like a lot of Woody Allen stuff, Manhattan is a big favourite, but I just can't see why Annie Hall is so revered. I recognise the major talent in Allen's armoury, his dialogue is choice and often witty, observations wry and reaction timing sometimes supreme. And I know, I do, that Annie Hall is a template of sorts that must have been seen as fresh back in 1977. But it appears to me that the film's central flaw is largely ignored on account of what has been termed as unique genius!The relationship at the core between Annie and Alvy is just dull, hardly anything happens between them, so are we meant to care about them? Or is it just a ruse for Allen to say some jokey one-liners? Interestingly, Allen himself has stated he was far from happy with how the film turned out, even going so far as to say it's not what he envisaged, was in fact disappointed that people only focused on the Alvy and Annie relationship. This makes sense to me since that aspect of the film is only a small thread of the intended whole cranial quilt. Does that make Annie Hall a fluke? That so many people missed what Allen was aiming for? To wit! It ultimately plays out as a series of disjointed witticisms formed around Allen's neurosis. Plenty of classical moments are within, and the actors are very good in making the scenarios work, but lots of little good bits do not make a 10/10 Academy Award winning classical whole.Yep, I'm very much in the minority, I know that, but Annie Hall's gigantic reputation bewilders me. Rest assured, though, I'm happy with that and it's unlikely I could ever sit through it again. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
it's better than I remembered.,"(Re-review 2011): I was telling my wife after seeing the movie again, for what I'm sure is only about the 20 or 30th time (and stuff just keeps getting funnier every time I see it), that while it is great, it's great in a very loose, sketchy-comedy kind of way. It has a story, and it's never hard to follow even as it jumps around (it even has, as we say in 'screenwriter-lingo', good 'plants' and 'pay-offs' with certain mentions of stuff), but it's not really about that. I have to figure it's cause Allen originally had a *three-hour* movie on his hands, that was Annie Hall and Manhattan Murder Mystery - or what would become of that.Oddly enough, I have to think that Allen canned the Manhattan Murder Mystery footage due to it, you know, not working, and then he and his fantastic editor Ralph Rosenblum made the film we have today out of all the sweet and funny relationship/cultural-awareness jokes that were in the story anyway. I'd be curious to see that footage though; in a way, when Allen finally made Manhattan Murder Mystery, he probably didn't change what he and Marshall Brickman originally wrote, he likely just grafted that script and then re-shot it (in some part as he was creatively pre-occupied at the time due to the Mia Farrow divorce going down). So, ultimately, Manhattan Murder Mystery is like his The Man Who Knew Too Much, a remake of his own material. But I digress.It's Woody Allen. It's Diane Keaton. It's Paul Simon in disco gear talking about chilling with 'Jack and Angelica'. It's Jeff Goldblum forgetting his mantra. It's Christopher (bleep) Walken on vacation from planet Wiseau. And it's Marshall MacLughan talking about fallacies and so on.Boy, if life were only like this.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Subtle yet hysterical,"I can't imagine anyone thinking ""Annie hall"" is ""dull"". Knowing the ""Star Wars"" fanaticism on the web, it's not surprising some science-fiction geeks would have antipathy sight-unseen for it winning Best Picture in 1977 (and I love science fiction -- but I love film even more.)For one, ""Star Wars"" was a blockbuster -- and in the 70's, blockbusters, no matter how silly, got nominated. (See ""The Towering Inferno""). Harrison Ford told George Lucas he couldn't write worth crap -- and even ""Star Wars"" isn't exactly original -- it's basically a bunch of one-dimensional ""types"" of characters. I preferred ""The Empire Strikes Back"" because it actually fleshed the characters out (being written by Lawrence Kasdan).That said, ""Annie Hall"" was so original it's been copied endlessly by other filmmakers -- from ""When Harry Met Sally..."" to ""Jeffrey"". It's so subtle even fans of the film miss some of its points --For instance, Alvy and Annie are never truly in love. In that famous ""lurve"" scene, for instance, Alvy basically twists Annie's arm to get her to say she loves him -- and she convinces herself. Meanwhile, Alvy avoids saying he loves her by using variations of the word (""I luff you, I lurve you..."") Once the viewer realizes that, the rest of the movie changes, and you understand parts of the reason that Alvy's never had a truly successful relationship.Even on totally face value, ""Annie Hall"" is extremely funny. From the lowbrow jokes -- ""Don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love!"" ""I'm with two guys named Cheech!"" to the deviously sexy -- ""Twins, Max! 16 years old. Think of the numerical possibilities!"" to the clever -- ""They're always giving awards -- Best Fascist Dictation: Adolf Hitler!"" ""Do they give out awards for that kind of music? I thought just earplugs."" Who can't laugh at the animation fantasy in which he envisions Annie as the Wicked Queen from Snow White? (""I don't get a period! I'm a cartoon character!"")""Annie Hall"" is Allen's best work, simply because it is one of the most imitated films ever, and, as we all know -- imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.One note-- even though the film is filled with cynicism and funny scenes, the ending always leaves me a little misty. It's wistful and touching.I guess I just need the eggs.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good, but probably overrated","I am an ardent fan of Woody Allen, and I think most of his films are underrated.

For me this would be more than a let down, and more of a fall-off-the-cliff down when compared to that often televised movie that has 7 sequels to date.

Again, my thinking about this lead character, might be influenced by the fact this movie followed Rocky as the Academy Award winner.I saw this movie on TV decades ago, but could not make it through to the end.

A valentine to unhappiness--and the need to be unhappy,"Successful stand-up comic revisits his past after meeting and falling for a daffy Gentile. Woody Allen discovered a sort of unintentional hipness with this romantic comedy, fancifully filling out this story with surreal bits that fit snugly into the story-structure and never throw the narrative out of whack. If the film isn't as fresh today as it was in 1977, that's because we know more about Allen and his penchant for neuroses than we did then. Many of Allen's ideas have also been recycled since ""Annie Hall"" (oft-times by Woody himself) and so it feels occasionally like a rerun. Still, the after-effects of a big love affair are clearly heartfelt, and the nostalgia near the finale is expertly conveyed. Long after the jokes are played out, ""Annie Hall"" still rings true simply for the pathos, which Woody pretends to toss off with a sad little shrug but which really stand the test of time. *** from ****",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ever.I know. Because I have spent the last few days reading them. It's all very daunting. Sitting down to write yet another review. What can I say about such a beloved and appreciated film? Other than: I love it, too. And, not having seen it in over fifteen years, I had pretty much forgotten how much of an impact it can have.""Annie Hall"" is the story of a relationship told in flashbacks and fantasy sequences. The narrator tells us in the opening moments that: ""Annie and I broke up and I still can't get my mind around that. I keep sifting the pieces of the relationship through my mind and examining my life and trying' to figure out where did the screwup come. A year ago we were in love."" And those opening lines are a perfect description of what is to follow.The movie has no linear structure, and no plot. It's mostly two people talking. Walking and talking in beautifully filmed sequences. There are a lot of fantasy sequences, too. No two of which are the same. One scene features subtitles to tell us what the characters are thinking, another scene shows Annie's mind leaving her body during sex, while another features people in different rooms (shown in split screen) having a conversation back and forth. Random strangers stop on the street with vital information, then depart again. And one of the scenes is animated. This is from 1977, by the way. The year it won the Best Picture Oscar.But this not a film of gimmicks. It's a film about love. The story of two very real people in love. AFI listed this as the greatest romantic comedy of all time. And it's easy to see why. There is a lot of romance in this movie and a lot of comedy, too. The stars/characters have astonishing chemistry and it's easy to believe that this woman is the Love Of His Life. The dialogue is peppered with some of the funniest dialogue every written for the screen, and many lines have escaped into popular culture and are quoted time and time again (""Don't knock masturbation; it's sex with someone I love"").In terms of content and storytelling technique, this is a masterpiece.

Woody's 1st Serious Artistic Achievement Mainly Because of Diane Keaton.,"Until 1977, Woody Allen films were mostly screwball comedies.  Pictures like BANANAS and EVERYTHING YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT SEX... were episodic comedies, films that seemed more like short television sitcoms along the Monty Python vein. He finally reached his full potential with what seems to be everyone's favorite Woody picture, ANNIE HALL.  It is without a doubt one of his better films and foresaw a lot of the narrative techniques and content you can see in his great films of the past decade.  This is Woody playing himself, more or less, for the first time, but it is Diane Keaton as the title character who steals the show in a heartwarming performance that won her an Academy Award.Woody plays comedian ""Alvy Singer"", a comedian who hates anything that is not New York and who cannot seem to function outside of it.  He is constantly bickering to best friend Tony Roberts about New York being considered a target for anti-semitism.  He is, for the first time in his long filmography, playing himself, a self-hating Jew who has broken relationships with women.  He even talks directly to the camera describing his paranoid self in the movie's first shot.  After some brief intercutting of failed marriage footage, ""Alvy"" meets the peculiar, but sensual ""Annie Hall"" from Wisconsin.At this point in ANNIE HALL, the film goes back and forth in time revealing the peaks and valleys of this sweet romance.  ""Annie"" is a lonely girl, plain-looking, but with a quality Woody and the audience can't quite put a finger on.  She grows more and more lovable as the story of these complete opposites evolves.  It is still hard to figure out what makes Annie so delightful to the eyes and the mind.  She is simple and endearing, which makes her more attractive to you as you watch.  It is great acting by Keaton, who is so original in her choice of wardrobe and mannerisms (especially her need to relieve tension a certain way).The film contains Woody standards like his fear of driving, his fear of bugs, or things that move in the dark (""you have a bug the size of a Buick in there""), and his mockery of Los Angeles.  The scenes in L.A. are some of the funniest I've seen in all of Allen's films especially the physical condition that besets him as soon as he gets off the plane.  ""Alvy"", like Woody, is always writing something too.ANNIE HALL is not my favorite Allen film.  That honor goes hands down to MANHATTAN, made just 2 years later.  Keaton has a major role in that flick, as an intellectual ""Annie"" you could say. His great films of the 90's MIGHTY APHRODITE and DECONSTRUCTING HARRY are direct descendants of ANNIE HALL because of the overlapping narrative, Woody's talking to the audience or to imaginary people, and adorable love interests.The one thing true of this film is that it is his warmest in regard to New York relationships and that is made completely possible because of Diane Keaton.  ""La-di-da, La-di-da,"" became as familiar to the American vernacular as ""Yada-Yada"" has in recent years to Seinfeld fanatics.  ANNIE HALL is complex in structure, yet deceptively simple and entered Woody into the big leagues of artistic filmmaking.RATING: ***1/2",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Good, but....actually somewhat overrated","It is hard to go to see Annie Hall without unrealistically high expectations given the extravagant praise lavished on the movie by so many people. I tried my best to stay neutral going into the experience -- my second viewing of it 35 years after my first -- but even with my restrained hopes I was somewhat disappointed with this film. Part of it is that the ""Woody Allen neurotic Jewish character"" is really quite tired for me. There are some scenes where Allen's nerdy, awkward, overly analytical and hypercritical schtick is quite funny (mainly the scenes in which he is pitted against spiders and their distant relatives, lobsters) but much of the time he is merely tolerable. I'm sure many people would disagree with my viewpoint, but for some of us Woody Allen is not the living end. If that makes us Philistines, then perhaps we can be cast in a future remake of Annie Hall and a 40ish actor playing Woody Allen can pull the real, now-quite-elderly Woody Allen from behind a potted palm tree to tell us how stupid we are for not adoring Woody Allen.The real reason to see this movie is Diane Keaton's performance. She is quite gifted at capturing a more genuine, goofy kind of awkwardness that is funny and endearing at once. She inhabits her character beautifully and richly deserved the Oscar she won for this portrayal.I also enjoyed the brief scene played by Christopher Walken. He has his own schtick -- playing weirdoes -- but weirdoes is a schtick I can swallow better than neurotic Brooklynites. Here Walken looks unbelievably young and, dare I say, very attractive with his immense forehead in full bloom. It's too bad he isn't given more screen time in this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Real Identitiy of Annie Hall,"What hardly anybody knows is that the real Annie Hall was an English woman, the wife of the famous dutch artist Jan Toorop and the mother of the almost equally famous female artist Charley Toorop.Jan Toorop (Poerworedjo, Java, December 20, 1858  The Hague, Netherlands, March 3, 1928) was a Javanese Dutch painter whose works straddle the space between the Symbolist painters and Art Nouveau.After his marriage to Annie Hall in 1886, Toorop alternated his time between The Hague, England and Brussels, and after 1890 also the Dutch seaside town of Katwijk aan Zee. During this period he developed his own unique Symbolist style, with dynamic, unpredictable lines based on Javanese motifs, highly stylised willowy figures, and curvilinear designs.Thereafter he turned to Art Nouveau styles, in which a similar play of lines is used for decorative purposes, without any apparent symbolic meaning. In 1905 he converted to Catholicism and began producing religious works. He also created book illustrations, posters, and stained glass designs.Charley Toorop was born in Katwijk 1891 and died in Bergen 1955. She made a lot of self portraits.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Assured and endearing comedy, being the fourth collaboration between Allen and Keaton.","Woody Allen's first commercial hit and the best collaboration with his then-sweetheart, Diane Keaton. It's easy to speculate that it was also his most autobiographical to date, containing his most attractive and charming scenes. This classic movie deals with a nervous and sensitive romance. Annie Hall is a film about a comedian, Alvy Singer (Woody Allen), who falls in love with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). Both of the characters are completely different but both strikingly entertaining and unusual. Allen plays the outlandish Alvy Singer, a writer of jokes for comic actors, a man of insignificant appearance, conditioned by his concerns about love, sex and death. One day he meets Annie Hall, played by Diane Keaton as a sensible girl who has achieved some success as a singer and photographer.Acclaimed coming-of-cinematic-age movie for Allen is based in part on his own life with the theme of the main role living in a house built under a rollercoaster followed through into his later 'Radio Days' . His love affair with Hall/Keaton is chronicled as a wistful, episodic comedy commenting on love, family, loneliness, communicating, maturity, city life, careers and various other topics. The picture operates on many levels, as does Keaton's wardrobe, which startled a major fashion trend. Director, writer and starring Allen himself alongside his then muse and girlfriend Diane Keaton, both of whom giving stunning interpretations. Woody Allen plays Alvy Singer, an extreme pessimist that obsesses over the subject of death and has very sarcastic and cynical views about the world and the people around him. And Annie Hall/Diane Keaton is a ditsy and clumsy talented singer and photographer. Allen's most awarded film, the Oscars voters were impressed and awarded various statuettes, winner among many other awards, of the Oscar for Best film, Direction, Script and Lead Actress. It is a brilliant combination of the best American comedy tradition with the most accurate diagnosis of relationship problems. Considered to be his most autobiographical film (something that Allen has always denied) and one of the best of his long career. Woody Allen and Diane Keaton are well accompanied by a wonderful cast made up of the best actors at the time, such as: Tony Roberts , Carol Kane, Paul Simon, Shelley Duvall, Janet Margolin, Colleen Dewhurst, Christopher Walken and Sigourney Weaver fans should keep their eyes peeled for her brief debut film appearance as Woody's date outside a cinema.This interesting motion picture was competently directed by Woody Allen, (co-written by Allen with his regular collaborator Marshall Brickman), adding the colorful cinematography by Gordon Willis, Allen's regular cameraman. In the beginning Woody made usually hilarious films in which he used to act, such as : ¨What's Up, Tiger Lily?¨, ¨Take the money and run¨, ¨Pussycat, Pussycat I Love You¨, ¨Sleeper¨, ¨Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex but Were Afraid to Ask¨, among others . Subsequently he made several masterpieces. Including a series of movies in which he provided nice direction, investing care enough, wit and warmth, such as : ¨Crimes and misdemeanors¨, ¨New York stories¨, ¨September¨, ¨Radio Days¨, ¨Hanna and her sisters¨, ¨Broadway Danny Rose¨, ¨Zelig¨, ¨Stardust memories¨, ¨A midsummer Night's Sex Comedy¨, ¨Interiors¨, ¨Purple rose of Cairo¨, ¨Manhattan¨, ¨Annie Hall¨, ¨Melinda Melinda¨ and many others . Rating 7/10 . Better than average. The movie will appeal to Woody Allen and Diane Keaton enthusiasts.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Woody Allen begins to grow up one of his best,"A young comedian (Alvy Singer) has just lost his girlfriend, Annie and can't work out what happened.  He goes back through his past in one long flashback to try and work out why and where it all went wrong.Woody Allen's career started out making films that were slapstick mixed with surreal humour.  He later moved to making more witty films that sought greater characterisation.  The missing link in this was Annie Hall - a film that effortlessly mixes the two.  The story is essentially a romance, but it spans back to Singers' childhood to weave a background for him.The way Allen links all the flashbacks is very clever - most have a link in terms of dialogue etc so that the narrative isn't so iffy.  The various tricks he uses are very imaginative as well - people's thoughts are shown in subtitles, Singer gets solves a cinema queue fight in a very novel way and at one point, to demonstrate how he makes the wrong choices in love, the film turns to a Snow White cartoon.Allen is great in the character he has played so many times.  His writing is excellent - clever mix of wit and surreal humour and his direction is faultless.  Keaton is excellent and very familiar with working with Allen. The support cast is excellent and is full of cameos (from famous faces and faces that later became famous) including Paul Simon, Shelley Duval, Christopher Walken, Sigourney Weaver, Beverly D'Angelo and Jeff Goldblum (`I've forgotten my mantra').Allen's best ever mix of his standup humour and his more adult character pieces.",,Anonymous,Romance
An American Classic,"Woody is firing from all cylinders, nailing one joke after another in this modern American classic. While ultimately considered a romantic comedy, Annie Hall defies all labels, blending multiple genres and creating a few new ones in the process.It's difficult to imagine for many of today's younger film-goers, but Woody Allen was once a terribly respected celebrity who could seem to do no wrong. In recent years his personal life and spotty track record have diminished his reputation, but many of his early works (Annie Hall chief among them) will live forever.In this brilliant dissection of an on-again/off-again couple, Allen plays Alvy Singer, a neurotic comedian undergoing a mid-life crisis. It's a role that Allen created, defined, and has essentially been playing in one form or another ever since. His love interest at the time (both on and off-screen) was Diane Keaton, who won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance as the title character. Annie and Alvy are both nuts (in general and about each other), but their differences play against and alongside one another beautifully. The film's resolution may leave some of us sighing, but we know it's the only sensible outcome.As stated earlier, Allen is in top form here, as a writer, actor, AND director. While some of his films around this time were more artsy, this one seemed to be his most creative, original effort. While he still wears his influences on his sleeves, actually naming a few in various scenes, his maniacal interpretation of his material is endlessly inspired. Everything from flashbacks to speaking to the camera to animation are employed perfectly in this stylistic hodgepodge.Lively direction aside, it's the killer material that truly makes this movie. The fairly short running time is jam-packed with jokes and gags, almost all of which work. Rarely does a line or scene fall flat. Every seemingly unnecessary utterance is there for a reason. When Annie stares quizzically at Alvy's red, erotic light-bulb, he casually mutters that they can now go about their business...and even develop photographs if they want to. Not only do the jokes work, but they're bursting at the seams with truth and relevance. In a single split-screen scene, Allen manages to humorously capture the inherent, unavoidable differences in the male and female psyches. Racism, sexism, libido, hippies, drugs, the Seventies, entertainment bureaucrats, New York vs. California, religion, conspiracy theories. All that and more is presented uniquely in what can easily be named one of the greatest films of the last 30 years. Now if only I could decide whether or not it's better than another late-70s Allen film called Manhattan.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Annie Hall"" reminds us that movies don't have to be focused and serious to be deep","If ""Annie Hall"" had been a later Woody Allen film, you'd be ready to slap him by the end of the film's opening monologue. But in 1977, the world was not full of Allen films filled with Allen humor and ""Allenisms."" Thank goodness for that, because the film is truly one where his character can't be the sole focus. This is a film about Annie, as the title suggests, which really makes this movie great and still shine among the Allen repertoire.The film stars Woody Allen as his usual neurotic, pessimistic self, in the form of comedian Alvy Singer and follows the story of his life with a focus on his relationships with women and his family. The chronology of the film is off-whack with the beginning being his childhood, followed by a time where he and Annie (Diane Keaton) are not getting along followed by the story of how they met with several tangents of Alvy's past wives, etc. thrown in the mix.Allen tests your patience with his character most of the time, but Keaton as Annie is absolutely intriguing. You are drawn to her inexplicably just as Alvy is. She's a complete mess of a character, but she is so convincing and so interesting. The two of them, along with the film, are so off-beat, but that's what makes it good. The characters walking through memories like ""A Christmas Carol"" and talking to the camera and the scene when they're in line at the theater and the guy behind Alvy completely irritates him are very fun and don't detract from the story.Perhaps the best part of the film is that it's not so serious. It's kind of ironic that Alvy is the biggest pessimist in the world, when his film sort of treats life in a casual and humorous way that's very much how things are sometimes. ""Annie Hall"" shows that film doesn't have to be about an intense subject that is more interesting than anyone's normal life. Normal life with strange, weird, but normal people can make for just as good of a film. A story about a relationship between two people doesn't have to be filled with sweeping moments of love and emotion. Would all this be nearly as effective if Allen and Keaton weren't really strong, believable characters? No, probably not, but that shows that there is more to good film than a unique plot that falls into a category beyond the average person's experience.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody's Best,"This has so many layers from intellectual humor to pratfalls. It has some of the most memorable characters in all of movie history. First of all, the script is full of what all comedy should be about: timing. The scenes where Annie and Alvy start their relationship are amazing. He, like his constant schmuck, has arrived at a place in his life, and even if he could change, he really doesn't want to. She is just starting to blossom, but carries around enough hangups to sink a battleship. He sees her beauty and her innocence, but can't pull himself out of growing up under a roller coaster. The scene with the lobsters, which he tries to reprise with another woman, and then he falls flat on his face. Her nutty family, particularly her brother, played by Christopher Walken. This was my first experience with one of the most wacko people in show business. At least his movie persona. Alvy is rooted in New York and that who California thing. The cocaine. The convertible with the destroyed top which he obviously tried to put up while he was cruising on the freeway. No one can present unrequited love as well as Woody. Every time I see him in his comic roles, I think, ""I really like him, but I would never want to be him."" There is a constipation in his characters but that's what makes it all work. You want them to be happy, but it's not in the cards.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Considered Allen's Best Film, I Personally Disagree","Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) recounts his love life and how he failed with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). This film is generally considered to be somewhat autobiographical, though only to a certain extent.This film has a lot of strengths. Appearances from Jeff Goldblum, Marshall McLuhan, and Christopher Walken... some cartoon work, some breaking of the fourth wall. Interesting subtitles. Allen used every gimmick available to make this film unique, and it won him some Oscars.Personally, for me, I don't know... I like many of the jokes, but the material just doesn't touch me. I found the humor in ""Love and Death"" a lot more witty. Relationships are complicated and Allen sure does make light of many of the serious things that fail a relationship. But I don't know, not my film.Despite this, I would still encourage you to see it. I think ""Love and Death"" or ""Sleeper"" are funnier, but ""Annie Hall"" has a seriousness to it that shows a more mature side of Woody Allen that was probably absent up to this point.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best Picture?! For what???!!!!!,"I can keep my review tthis movie short. A bit of romance and comedy make a 90 minutes long solid movie. But there is literally nothing exceptional. That's it go and watch it if you are interested.Oh, wait! It has won 4 Acadamy Awards?! Including best picture?! In a year in which the most influential movie of all time came out?!!! This is too much for me. I mean you can like this movie, love it, but every human with a functioning brain knows that Star Wars revolutionized not just moviemaking but the entire entertainment industry. Until today the influence this movie has can be seen. And they gave Best Picture to this garbage. You need a prove that humanity has failed? Here you are!!!",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
My Favorite Film of All Time,"Annie Hall (1977)**** (out of 4)Woody Allen's Oscar-winning masterpiece has him playing Alvy Singer, a paranoid writer who recounts his up and down relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), a wannabe singer. I'll admit right up front that ANNIE HALL is my favorite movie of all time. No matter what type of mood I'm in, I can push play on this film and it makes me laugh each time. Many people say this is the film where Allen really grew up and I think I'd have to agree. While he made several very good movies before this one, I think there's a really terrific structure here that we probably wouldn't have gotten earlier in his career. The film flashes from various points in the story and I really think this jumping around structure made for a much better picture. I love how we start off seeing the couple in happy times and then we flash back to how they met. I also enjoyed the clever little touches that Allen threw in including the sequence where they discuss Annie's previous boyfriends and we see the Allen and Keaton characters go back to those ""dates"" and question what she was thinking going out with these men. Several movie rules are broken here including Allen stopping the actual film with his character talking directly to the audience but this works so well and gets so many laughs that you can't help but love when it happens. Just check out the flashback sequence of Allen in his classroom and the kids begin to talk about where they are currently in their lives. This sequence should have fallen flat on its face but it's just so loving and tender that you can't help but laugh. The film also has some terrificly nice drama, a fine romance and of course the laughs. I would argue that this is without question one of the greatest screenplays from Allen because there's just so much going on and it just comes off as being a full character study. Of course, it also doesn't hurt that the two stars have so much terrific chemistry together. Allen and Keaton were involved with each other at this time so perhaps a lot of the chemistry is real but no matter if it was real or if they were acting, the two characters are perfectly brought to life. I think Allen has never been funnier in his career as this paranoid character is one he's played many times but never better than here. Keaton, who rightfully won an Oscar, comes off so charming and real that you can't help but love her. The supporting cast features some fine performances with Tony Roberts really standing out. Other familiar faces include Carol Kane, Paul Simon, Shelley Duvall and Christopher Walken in a hilarious bit. ANNIE HALL is my favorite film of all time but even with a critical eye, I think the film works so well that even those who hate Allen should enjoy it. It's the perfect mix of comedy and drama but it also has fun with the East Coast vs. West Coast. The film is full of laughs but it also has a heart and this really makes it one of the greatest love stories out there.",,Anonymous,Romance
Cheerful and heart warming,"Visually the film is exactly what you would expect from a Romantic Comedy film of that era, boring. This is not really a problem because what carries this film along on its feet is the fantastic dialogue and Woody Allen. Obviously written by Allen himself which is already an ingredient for a masterpiece. His stop start sentences and jumpy movements are almost like that of Robert Downey Jr. in someways, which is a good thing in my books as i think Downey is a fantastic actor, though i cant get past the feeling that almost whatever film he is in with some exception, hes literally plays himself. First Impressions of Allen is also this kind of self portrayal. I think this is what creates this brilliant recipe for this fantastic dish of a film. Allens interaction with the audience is great and adds to the audience relating to the character.The film itself has a strange flow to it, With numerous flashbacks jumping back and forth to the past and then straight back into the present. There's some great use of Audio that add to the effect it is what the characters are thinking.In terms of humour it's extremely witty, a line about masturbation springs to mind. It goes something along the lines of ""Whats great about masturbation is that your always having sex with someone you love."" There is some really great lines and quotes from Groucho Marx which when applied to the films context and plot make for extremely inspiring thoughts and you cant help but compare it to your own lease of life.Such a great film. I give it 9 out of 10.Defiently worth a watch and definitely something you will enjoy. What a great love Romantic Comedy.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
still funny and daring,"Neurotic New York comedian Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) rehashes his love life to discover the cause of the ending of his romantic relationship to Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). He's been married twice before. She likes to smoke weed but he doesn't. Her family is cold to him. What seems small and even charming at first turns ugly as their relationship deteriorates. They try again but they soon find it's not working.The surreal and the touching really elevates this movie. This is one scene after another of compelling vignettes from a relationship. The writing is amazing. Despite its rapid fire style, it still feels connected and never loses touch with the audience. It's like a series of memories but it flows like a narrative. Many of the jokes are still as fresh as the first time I saw the movie. It's more interesting and daring than most movies today.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
You Forget That It Was Shot In The 70's,"From the exceptional writing of Woody Allen and Marshall Brickman (Brickman a banjo player who was in the group ""The Journeyman"" with John Phillips and Michelle Phillips who had success as Mamas & Papas left to pursue writing for television, Candid Camera, The Tonight Show and The Dick Cavett Show) you forget that you are watching characters act. The acting feels real and genuine. After you get past Allen breaking the fourth wall in the introduction with his monologue you get a sense of invitation to this New York style of living that is displayed throughout the movie with Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) a couple who has an up and down then out relationship. Especially the lobster/kitchen scene when they are throwing the lobster around then into the pot gives you a sense of script and improvisation that makes you laugh out loud. Along with the breathing hand held camera the scene makes the looseness in a closed form feel open.The style of Annie (Diane Keaton) and even Woody's wardrobe (Glasses) is being fashioned today. Watch any award show with HipHop generation and you would see dancers wearing the vest and tie.The long takes in this film works. The cinematography by Gordon Willis (Godfather) is excellent. Without the editing of Ralph Rosenbloom this style of movie would not exist. This film is definitely one of my favorites.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A good romantic comedy, with flaws and virtues, that didn't deserve four Oscars. Despite that, it deserves the appreciation of fans of this movie genre.","Woody Allen is one of those directors that many people love, many people can't stand, and many people find just stupid. I've seen some of his films that I liked, and I've seen others that I hated, and I can understand why he is one of those who have never been able to assert himself and have a consensual recognition.The film is a romantic comedy based on the relationship of a couple played by Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. They like each other, but they can't make the relationship work harmoniously. Of course, this leads to funny and embarrassing situations. Released in the aftermath of the ""sexual revolution"", the film tackles the topic of sexuality bluntly and they openly discuss it. I don't know if it's necessary to say, but the dialogues are an important feature of the film, and the two characters are talking almost all the time.One of the strengths of the film is its apparent simplicity and elegance: it is a simple film, so simple and apparently cheap that it smells of indie. There are no complicated visual effects, the cinematography is functional and has good lighting, the sets are very realistic, simple and pragmatic, everyone seems to be wearing their own clothes... And in the center of the spotlight is the acting couple in a magnificent work. They don't even look like they're there playing characters, they just look like themselves!However, it is far from being a problem-free film. Sex is a topic approached in a sincere way, but it dominates their discussions, it is so omnipresent that it ends up being tiring, like those people who are always talking about the same thing and do not shut up or change the subject. Allen's style of humor is also far from leading to consensus: some like it, say it is informal, brilliant in its simplicity, and others already consider it simply stupid, tasteless and, at times, offensive.The film was one of the great winners of the 1977 Oscars, and that for many people is something. In my opinion, I think Diane Keaton deserved the Oscar for Best Actress, she does a remarkable job. Likewise, I think the film deserved the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, the film's story and dialogues justifies it well, but Allen did not deserve the Oscar for Best Director, which would have been more justly given to George Lucas, also nominated for the first film of the ""Star Wars"" saga. And since these two films competed for the Oscar for Best Picture, it's really hard to understand how this film won the award. I think that even Allen fans accept that ""Star Wars"" deserved the statuette and that the academy just didn't want to do it because it was a sci-fi movie. Now, let's get to the point: is the movie good, is it really worth it? Of course, it's a subjective answer, depending on what you like. People who like romantic comedies with a lot of dialogue will enjoy it, but others can skip it without feeling like they've really lost anything by doing it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Novel, witty rom-com that failed to get me invested","Keaton and Allen play Alvie and Annie, two odd-balls that find a natural chemistry but nonetheless always seem to be clashing. The film flicks between past and present exploring the ups and downs of the relationship. At times, it's a blur that resembles memories, with one seemingly inconsequential scene abruptly ending, and another playing out straight afterwards as if unrelated to the former. Relationships are not led by events, but relations between one another, and it is this that the film focuses on.The rom-com offers a little bit for everyone. There's laugh out loud (and sometimes absurd) comedy, novel filming techniques, intellectual references, and an exploration of a relationship that cuts deeper than most romantic films.I found enough bits clever and enough bits funny to appreciate the film, but I also found myself increasingly detached by the end. I looked at how much time was left a couple of times, which is surprising given the short length of the feature. The way the film was stitched together is part of its originality and appeal, but I also think the style resulted in me failing to get invested in either character.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny and Charming? Definitely. Classic? Maybe...,"Of the Woody Allen films I have seen, this one is the best. As usual, Woody is concerned with a love story. Alvy Singer is a neurotic and hyper comedian who meets and falls very quickly in love with the flamboyant and ditsy Annie Hall. We follow their love story as it's told to us through short sequences that are not necessarily in chronological order.Diane Keaton is superb as the titular character of Annie Hall. Her Best Actress Oscar was well-deserved. Woody Allen, essentially playing the same character he always does, seems to be at his best here too. It feels almost as though this story had special significance to him.A lesson in ironic comedy, Mr. Allen uses unique storytelling and humor to engage his audience and surprise them. The characters say whatever comes to mind, speak to the camera, and talk to random strangers on the street- yet somehow this only makes them seem more real. And yes, it makes them very funny, too.If you're a die-hard fan of Woody Allen, you just might think it's the best movie ever made. For the rest of us, it's mostly a light-hearted and endearing romp. No matter where you fall in those categories, it's definitely worth a watch.Jay Addison",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Writing Was Decent,"The film was not. This was my first lesson in that the Oscars were (and are) about what people in the industry think is important. The movie is honestly below average. Woody Allen (who slept with, then married, his adopted daughter) was never a good actor. Like John Wayne (until True Grit and The Shootist), he played every role the same. And not well. Try and watch this film and not cringe every time he's on screen.And Diane Keaton? Best Actress? If you've seen her in anything, you've seen her performance in this movie. Same laugh, same takes, same line delivery.DOA.What's sad, is that much like high school politics (class president, prom queen), The Oscars are only about who, and what are popular in the moment to other actors and directors. It isn't about what movie audiences find compelling.While there have been times where the two coincide, it's rare. Take a look at the best picture winners of the last 12 years, and watch them. There is no way the average American movie goer would vote most of them (Oppenheimer might be an exception) as the picture of the year.It's all about messed up moral values and who's who.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

"If Life were like This,","Annie Hall is a brilliant movie with a very well written plot and a terrific cast. Some of Woody Allen's finest work, the film explores relationships beautifully, in a blunt manner that shows both the good and the bad of being in love. We get to see all the spirals of Alvy ahd Annie's life together, getting such a good feel that the characters truly become human, as we are watching two people who are in love in real life.I did find that other characters were not developed enough, I understand that it is Alvy and Annie's story, but I would like to have seen more scope from the likes of Tony Roberts character, whose potential was never used fully, I felt. Giving these characters more time to shine would have made the film more realistic, cause having it focus so much on the couple made it a little dream like, it would have made sense for them to be with friends more.The cast is all around terrific with load of great cameos throughout, but the credit goes to, of course, Allen and Diane Keaton. It is difficult to say that their performances were brilliant cause it's difficult to know how much of it was really acting, as both of them were involved with each other at the time, which really makes for great authenticity, they can be serious, but they also have fun with one another, and it's very sincere play.Manages to be both goofy and meaningful.

Alvi (Woody Allen) explains his trials and tribulations of his relationship with his girlfriend Annie (Dianne Keaton),"Academy award winning film ""Annie Hall"" immediately introduces us to Alvi (Allen), with his trials and tribulations with Annie (Keaton). From the beginning of the film, he breaks the fourth wall by talking directly to the audience so we can establish a connection with his character. His quirky personality and comedic jokes (""don't knock masturbation, it's sex with someone I love"") produces a cheerful atmosphere and allows the audience to favor him. The film uses a non-linear narrative which assists in portraying the awkward and sporadic relationship between them. He continuously criticizes everything he encounters with his witty remarks, which is why I get the sense that Woody Allen is playing himself as his character seems so natural and carefree. This steers away from the predictable formula of a Hollywood film as it opens with Alvi informing us of his break up with Annie. The film generates a realistic appearance since the characters feel natural and unglamorous, unlike a typical Hollywood film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

His Oscar for best Lead Actor is very well-deserved as well, as he does an incredible job with his fourth-wall breaking cynical protagonist.Everything is just so well put together and cinematographied, and it's just an amazing film with excellent writing and acting all around.

Talky romcom with Woody Allen and Diane Keaton is consistently amusing,"A twice-divorced neurotic stand-up comedian in New York City (Woody Allen) details his perspective on life and his relationship with the scatterbrained Annie Hall (Diane Keaton).The best movie I've seen by Woody Allen is the excellent ""Match Point"" (2005), but that was a crime drama/romance/thriller whereas a lot of his films are talky romantic dramedies, which is the case with ""Annie Hall"" (1977), winner of Best Picture and other awards at the AA. Was it worthy of all the accolades and does it hold up? Well, I laughed consistently if that tells you anything.The movie uses techniques that were probably innovative when it was released in 1977, like Annie's immaterial essence doing something else why her body's in bed with Alvy (Allen). The dialogue-driven approach is refreshing (today, that is) and the way Alvy sometimes breaks the fourth wall is amusing. I also enjoyed seeing the mid-70s period in the background, like ""Messiah of Evil"" (1973) on the marquee and a billboard featuring DESTROYER-era KISS.The film runs 1 hour, 33 minutes and was shot in New York City & Long Island and the Los Angeles area.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"I Think Of ""Annie Hall"" As The Cynic's Parallel To ""It's a Wonderful Life"". I Like That Contrast","Revisiting Annie Hall is like meeting up with a friend you have not seen in years, it really is that personal. I find it hard to comprehend as to how anyone could not find some sort of connection with the film's honesty. The film's bond with its viewer is quite possibly the key basis as to why the film is so globally admired, as it is a film which both men and women can relate to. Not only this, but Annie Hall offers the viewer the idea that they are not alone in their disillusion of love, and that it is human nature for the majority of love to quite literally fade away with time.Annie Hall is another bittersweet, charming and identifiable tale of romance, but from Woody Allen's cynical point of view. Set in New York, Woody Allen is arguably performing as himself, a neurotic comedian named Alvy Singer, who is struggling to balance his love life, while tackling his own self-reservations and negative outlooks on life. The film charts his erratic lifestyle by looking at his experiences, exaggerating them and attempting to understand where he went wrong. Woody Allen accomplishes all this through hysterically unique narrative-cuts, including questioning the viewer and showing his urge to of spoken his mind in a particular situation.Annie Hall is both a bleak film, while also being an oddly uplifting one, and a film which I find considerably therapeutic. Bursting with intellect and philosophy, Annie Hall remains Woody Allen's definitive masterpiece, the film which defines both him and his career. The film's beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and although there is a fair amount of bleak cinematography there is still no denying the beauty that lies in the film's final montage. The charming sequence defines everything Woody Allen wanted to say about life and how everything is a series of frantic events.Annie Hall is widely regarded for possessing one of the finest scripts of all-time, and rightly so. Few scripts burst with such a fierce amount of fiery, sharp humour and cultural knowledge. Using devastating heart-break to side-splitting one-liners, the film continuously succeeds in letting each actor and actress deliver their line with perfect comedic essence. Flowing with misery and negativities the script feels so true to its form. Mixing tragedy with humour is a technique Woody Allen has mastered. The brutal honesty is highly effective as it sufficiently represents moments that we all go through in life. The script's use of sexual irony and sexual innuendo is apparent in almost every scene, delightfully representing both genders' outlook on sex. The script pontificates over its characters, which are all flawed in some way, yet all so delightfully charismatic. Rather than being a one-track, simple-minded comedy, Annie Hall develops its themes, rather than carelessly glossing over them.In Annie Hall the actors and actresses do not look glamorous, or even close to Hollywood stars. They look natural, and that is what helps the film slide away from being the clichéd American romance. It is actually a method which enables the film to become a symbol of the average person's life. Not only this, but the narrative is presented in a revolutionary manner, altering the average occurrence (such as a dinner party) into a study of a person's physical gestures, this is a way of representing what a person is thinking. Woody Allen is offering the viewer a psychological analysis of the lives we live. Woody Allen uses time as a method of gaining a perspective of the events in Alvy Singer's love-life. Even when the narrative is told in a non-linear style the film still pieces itself together through editing, hence the film is not chaotic, but the romance is. The disconnected editing and transitions actually help to embody the sporadic and nervous relationship, while seemingly portraying the varied speed and detachment our lives move at.The performances all help to make Annie Hall the film it is today, Diane Keaton and Woody Allen have perfect chemistry and both create emotional parallels for their characters. To add to the organic experience of Annie Hall, all the stutters, unfinished sentences, delayed responses and mispronounced words are used during conversation. Do not forget to look out for the variety of small, yet highly amusing cameos from some of America's most famous actors and actresses.Suffice to say, Allen's awkward humour is an acquired taste and I would recommend it being a necessity to become familiar with his work before being able to appreciate Annie Hall to its best extent. To some, the humour is subtle; to others, it is openly hysterical. Although, the one thing everyone can agree on is the film's innovation, even if you do refuse to believe that love does not prevail. But really, Woody Allen is aware that Annie Hall is funny because everything about it is all so true and he can see the humour behind his own unhappiness.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen's magnum opus,"Whether you love Woody Allen, hate him or feel nothing about him at all, you should see this movie that cemented him as a iconic filmmaker. His trademark neurotic, slightly misanthropic humor permeates a story about a New York couple, a Manhattan comedian and a female singer from the Midwest who attract despite their stark differences.Like almost any classic Woody Allen film, this one stands out by virtue of its use of varying New York locations and non-grandiose banter between ordinary people. Even if you know everything about Woody Allen as a man, this film will still transport you back to bygone era in which he as a director was just beginning to define his style and put his stamp on the film industry.Woody is his trademark excellent self and Diane Keaton shines as in the title role, as his intense but somewhat insecure girlfriend. Some nice supporting turns come up from Tony Roberts, Paul Simon, Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum. I only wish more films had something to say about spiders in the bathroom. A bittersweet conclusion completes the film perfectly. Recommended to everyone, bar none.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Razz Ma Tazz,"The thing that sets this apart from other Woody Allen Movies is its sheer, electrifying efficiency. Sure, the Director/Writer/Actor is what he always is. A self deprecating, death obsessed, Nazi hating, neurotic Jew.But here he is intertwined with so much wrap around that it is a dizzying, yet sharply edged commentary about love, culture, show biz, and human frailty. It is an unrestrained, razz-ma-tazz of Cinema techniques and stand up one-liners and it is all stirred with some biting bemusement.Diane Keaton also is such an on screen force that Woody, at times, has to put it in overdrive just to keep up. He never fails. The pace is a non-stop, intelligent display of Artistic angst and there is so much fun that there isn't any time, except afterward, to contemplate all that has gone before.A rich and rather poignant picture that pulls out all the tricks but never seems self indulgent, with just enough inquiry into the human psyche and just enough of the ridiculous to make this a unique and fascinating Film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Inventively made, but a little overrated.","A warmhearted, entertaining comedy, considered by many to be Woody Allen's best film.  While I don't agree 100% on that (for example, it's inferior to ""Hannah and her Sisters""), I do think it's a very witty film, packed with inventive moments (like Diane Keaton literally leaving her body during one unwanted (by her) lovemaking scene - ""while you two are busy, can I do some drawing?""). Woody Allen goes from slapstick comedy (the ""lobster scene"") to self-sarcasm to bitersweet romance, never forgetting to spout some often hilarious one-liners (""in the case of war, I'll be a hostage""). But the film is not quite as profound as it's supposed to be, and the narrative often gets too jumbled.   (***)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

camera,"The way Woody Allen used the camera to his advantage in the film added a lot to Annie Hall. When he directly addressed the camera as he was portraying his thoughts, it helped us understand what he was thinking. The other way he used it was to tell past stories. Both these ways added to the effect the movie had on the person watching it.When Woody Allen stepped aside and talked directly to the camera and portrayed his thoughts about the scene at hand it helped me to understand what was going on. When he stepped back and addressed the camera it was like he was narrating the action going on to help us understand better. I thought this technique added a lot to the movie because the movie was all about his life and by addressing the camera we were able to hear his direct thoughts so it was like we were actually living his life. This technique really showed that the whole movie was about him because in every situation we got his perspective on it.The second way he used the camera was to narrate past stories. This helped the plot out a lot because it showed us exactly what went on. We didn't have to listen to a story about Alvy Singer's past life; we could see it first hand and really experience it. By doing this we were able to understand his past a lot better then if we just heard him telling us about it. It also helped that he was in the background like a ghost narrating out what was going on in the scene. Between these two things we were able to get a very accurate picture of Alvy's past. So both these camera techniques that Woody Allen used to tell Alvy Singer's story were great ideas because they helped out a lot in the telling and understanding of the story line.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
When Woody was Young and Fresh,"Why is this his best film?  Because he is still showing his wonderful love affair with New York City, because he is showing the great Diane Keaton in her like-Buster put-ons.  Because he knew then how to make indelible images in your mind: think of Annie in her goofy hat and tie and mannerisms.Because they were new, we didn't have other images of him reproducing the same thing, the same tics, the same stale routines.  And of course, we didn't have to have our minds clouded with sordid images of his personal life.  Not that an artist's private life (or a politician's for that matter) should affect the power of his works: Picasso's 'Guernivica"" is still magnificent despite his brutality to women; Woody is still a master of photography, comedy and nebbishness, despite his psychological incest.I understand that if I were Jewish I would 'get' even more of the movie than I did: when Annie orders a corned beef sandwich on white bread with mayonnaise, she is violating some Jewish deli more.  Guess I'll have to watch it with a Jewish friend of mine so he can point out such things to me.So, see 'Annie Hall' again: the test of a great movie is that it is great no matter WHEN you see it...immediately, 10 years or 20 years after (what about 'Metropolis'?)  It is WE who have changed, and there's nothing like a great movie to show us surprisingly how.And, Woody, it's time for you to make another NYC movie: a post 9/11 one with your choice of theme......a comic tragedy, maybe?  that would highlight the heartless mercenary/political  uses of the tragedy being made by Big Business and Bush?",,Anonymous,Romance
Ett prefekt flöde av cerebralt lättsamt historieberättande,"Jag har precis sett denna film och jag vet inte vad jag känner. Vet inte vad jag ska skriva. Men det tokigaste är att jag inte kan sätta fingret på varför jag inte kan säga något?Annie Hall av Woody Allen är en historia i ett perfekt flöde. Fjärde väggen är en teaterbalkong där vi får sitta medan skådespelarna (främst Woody Allen) näst intill samtalar med oss. Och det känns som ett genuint samtal. Som att personen som detta händer faktiskt kommenterar det som händer medan det fortsätter hända.Diane Keaton spelar titelpersonen Anni Hall. En öppen själ som möter neurotiske komikern Alvy (Woody Allen) och de fattar omedelbart tycke. Som nämnt så bryter filmen fjärde väggen vitt och brett, men den hoppar också i tiden och använder en del okonventionella grepp som undertexter som vid visar vad karaktärerna egentligen menar och tänker.Det hela är en lek med filmskapandet, med publiken och bitvis med varandra. Men allt detta utan att tappa bort historien som berättas. Flödet i filmen är som sagt perfekt - jag kan inte minnas en scen där jag tappade filmen eller där jag inte var intresserad av det som skedde på duken. Det är mästerligt gjort och jag förstår varför denna film hyllas som Woody Allens kanske bästa.Fanns det något att lära sig från filmen? Ja, på samma sätt som det finns i att dela någons livserfarenhet. Man kan se personens misstag och framsteg, se var de hamnade och kanske förstå lite varför. Något som man sedan kan ta till sig som en varning eller en förebild, beroende på var man själv tror att man vill färdas.Jag skulle starkt rekommendera denna film för filmintresserade som ännu inte sett den. I övrigt för den som gillar en blandning av cerebral och lättsam film - för Anni Hall lyckas med konstycket att vara båda på samma gång. Hatten av för Mr. Allen.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Annie Hall: a reflection of us,"Annie Hall is one of my favorite movies. Starred by Woody Allen itself and Diane Keaton this master piece has become a classic and I believe it is one of the best movies of all times.The story opens with Allen's character telling two key jokes which seem really funny at first but after watching the film we understand they aren't as hilarious as we thought. Through a unique narrative style Woody chronicles the relationship between two neurotic people over several years. Alvy and Annie live in New York and, by some imaginary time trips, during the film we are showed both of their lives before having met.The audience is trapped by this cute and funny love tale that talks about the eternal search for satisfaction that most of the people have to deal with during their short, lonely, painful but beautiful lives. These people are us and we can't help thinking that at least one character behaves like us or like someone we know.Allen presents us, thus, a quite pessimistic but clever reflection upon life supported by unforgettable dialogues flawlessly interpreted by the cast.Ten out of ten",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Pure Woody Allen,"When you watch a Woody Allen film, you know what you're getting. And in ""Annie Hall,"" you get it in spades. Not a lot of people would come up with this line: ""My grammy never bought me presents, you know? She was too busy being raped by Cossacks."" But Woody does, and you either love him or hate him for it.This is a good Allen film, no denying it. That said, you'll know beforehand whether this film is worth your time. Already, in the mid 70s, Allen was starting to look too old to play a guy who wins the heart of a younger girl. (This problem only gets worse in later films where he insists on wooing Mira Sorvino or Helen Hunt.) Here, the age gap is still OK. Soon after, it's not. But any guy who can roll Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy into one line of dialogue, well, I'm OK with it.It's snooty. It's intellectual. It's the world of Manhattan that would never dare venture south of, say, Houston Street. And if that's cool with you, then so is ""Annie Hall.""PS. Middle America need not apply.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"As a cultural artifact, it's a must-see","Hey, I'm not gonna lie, I watched ""Annie Hall"" to see what beat out ""Star Wars"" at the Oscars. And I can see why; it's a critical darling, and has left its own imprint on popular culture. Everything from sitcom to romantic comedy owes a debt to this movie.I liked this movie well enough, primarily for the script. It's playful with staging and multiple fourth-wall breaks (Woody Allen at his funniest here), and written for an adult audience. And Diane Keaton's ditzy performance added a necessary dose of sweetness. On the other hand, It was Allen's presence that sucked a good deal of enjoyment, at least for me. Had I seen this movie forty yeas ago, his neuroticism would've probably seemed a lot fresher to me. As it is, it feels overplayed and grating.But I also know I'll revisit this someday, and I'm probably in store for an epiphany. This just feels like one of those movies.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Editing Makes the Film,"Re-watching this today I was struck by how this may have suffered the biggest Oscar snub of all time. Famously this film didn't start out as a romantic comedy but was a larger work of three different strands including a murder mystery (?). The first rough cut was over 2 hours and 30 minutes. Allen and Rosenblum than removed more than hour of material to shape it into a Rom. Comedy. It is amazing that the film even works in light of that. Further, one of the main techniques in the storytelling is free association where scenes bounce off of each other as they would occur to Alvy's consciousness and the film's timeline is a complete jumble. But it works. The film is hysterical and touching. It has a beating heart that captures the maddening nature of love. It is singularly a Woody Allen film.There are other films by Allen which are better but this is everything the man is about. The experimental story structure, the neurotic intellectualized comedy, the self deprecating jabs at himself and film making it is all here. And the film works.That it also features an absolutely charming Keaton performance is just a bonus.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody being Woody,"Woody Allen, for better or for worse, is always going to be Woody Allen. He carved out his niche in film history just by being himself. Annie Hall is a film which he wrote, directed and starred in. The character he plays is named Alvy Singer but let's be honest, it's Woody playing Woody with all that entails, all the quirks that are part of the Woody Allen package. Alvy's a neurotic, Jewish comedian who calls New York City home. New York is more than home really, it's a big part of who Alvy is, the only place he could ever be. Alvy insulates himself from the world, the woman he loves embraces it. That woman is of course Annie Hall. She's a quirky, ditzy aspiring singer. Eventually she will set her sights on California. California? Oh no, this is something Alvy is just not equipped to handle. So the relationship falls apart. But we already knew that because Alvy told us right at the beginning of the film that the relationship was already over. Allen plays with time throughout the film, jumping from the end to the middle to the beginning and back to the end again. Flashbacks to Alvy's childhood shed some light on what made this man the neurotic bundle of nerves he has become. Along the way there are plenty of laughs but some serious moments too. This is not just a slapstick farce, it's a movie that's got some real heart to it. You can't help but feel for poor Alvy Singer.Of course Alvy is not the easiest man to embrace so you certainly sympathize with Annie too. Loving Alvy Singer is quite a challenge. If anyone's up to the task it's the supremely flighty Annie. In playing the part Diane Keaton is the wonderful yin to Woody's yang. Opposites really do attract I guess. Keaton and Allen have wonderful chemistry, playing off one another beautifully. There are times when Annie is perhaps a little too much of a ditz to really take seriously but you remind yourself that this is after all a Woody Allen comedy. Seriousness is appreciated at times but certainly not always required. The film is not just one joke after another, in fact there are plenty of stretches with no jokes at all, times where the story is allowed to breathe. And simple though it may be it really is a very good story.Annie Hall is not a film to leave you doubled over with laughter. Oh sure, there are some truly hilarious moments. Alvy's skewering of some pretentious twit standing behind him in line at the movies is as good as comedy gets. Allen makes use of all kinds of comedic devices, paying no attention to the rules most Hollywood filmmakers adhere to. In a Woody Allen film there are no rules. He'll break the fourth wall, he'll use subtitles to reveal characters' thoughts, he'll even toss in an animation sequence. Anything goes. Not everything works perfectly but it all works well enough to make the end result very satisfying. There are so many little moments, throwaway lines which are unimportant in the grand scheme of things but which add great flavor to the comedic stew. The guy who forgot his mantra? Priceless. There is the sense that once the movie settles in it could use a few more laughs along the way. It never quite hits the heights of that movie line sequence from very early on in the film. But there is plenty here to embrace, not least the two great characters of Alvy Singer and Annie Hall, portrayed so wonderfully by Allen and Keaton. Two great performers creating two unique characters in a love story only Woody Allen could tell.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Still Crazy After All These years?,"It's still got it. We're now at October 2019 and Annie Hall is still funny, engrossing and relevant. I first saw this film as a teenager when it came out in 1977. I've seen it four or five times since but not in the last 10-15 years. Allen's film is still different enough to seem new and is not embarrassing because of it's age. Jokes, opinions, filming style even clothes fashion haven't dated. Diane Keaton for instance still dresses amazingly in places with looks that wouldn't be out of place in a films or even bohemian life today. In fact what has changed for me over the years watching this film is Keaton. When I first saw Annie Hall I saw her as Allen's stooge. Someone he used to bounce jokes and ideas off but, now, gradually, over the years, I've come to see Allen as more like just the gag man. I watch Annie Hall now and think the film is so aptly named because it is the character Annie Hall, even more than Albie, who is central to the film and Keaton's playing of her is such a perfect mix of the naive, ditzy and girl wanting to experience life. Yes, still a film I would watch again.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Classic, timeless, a must see for anyone, everyone","In Manhattan, neurotic Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is trying to figure out what caused his break-up with longtime girlfriend, Annie (Diane Keaton). True, the two were mismatches from the start. Alvy, raised in Brooklyn apartment under the Coney Island roller coaster, is Jewish and intellectual. Annie, however, from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, is a WASP who came to New York to make it as a singer and uses words like ""la di da"" and ""grammy"". So, how did it begin? Divorced, Alvy met Annie at a mixed doubles tennis match. Afterwards, Annie stuttered her way into giving Alvy a ride home, where he hugged the seat in terror at her erratic driving. Yet, things develop. Alvy encourages Annie to pursue her singing career more diligently, read more books, and go to therapy. Meanwhile, Annie tries to get Alvy to enjoy life more freely and enthusiastically. But, when a record producer (Paul Simon) catches Annie's act and wants her to come to California and spend time in the studio, will it be the end? This is a classic timeless film, Allen's best, in the view of many. It is extremely funny and breathes intelligence in every frame. Allen and Keaton shine as the lovebirds while Tony Roberts, Simon, Carol Kane, and Shelley Duvall back them up nicely. In a cameo, Christopher Walken is terrifying and comical. Of course, the Manhattan setting is terrific, the quirky costumes are memorable, and the direction quite clever and varied. So, what are you waiting for?

A unique and very true story about love,"It's hard to believe, I have seen so many movies, yet I have never seen a WOODY ALLEN film, it just never came to my mind. But Annie Hall is probably his most famous work and I figured that at least I could see this film since it won best picture against Star Wars, while I'm still debating if it was the best picture of 1977, I still can't deny that this was an excellent film. The story was so wonderful and really opened the doors for the battle of the sexes, I don't think a film before this could have depicted such a better way of the way we think of the opposite sex.Alvy Singer is a comedian, slightly famous, he does everything right in his career, he always has the right lines, a great apartment in New York, a fun imagination, but with the ladies? Well, there he becomes more short handed. But that all changes when Alvy meets a naive but lovely woman, Annie Hall. She is a singer who is trying to make it, but when he and she become an item, she opens up more and wants to do more, but Alvy just would prefer to keep things the way they are.The film is really remarkable and I have to say that I could understand it's praise, the story still remains so true to this day and any adult could really understand it's premisous. I loved the scene where both Annie and Alvy are at their therapists and they explain that the sex they're having is either not enough or too much. There are so many classic scenes, I would just recommend this film, it's a great classic that anyone could enjoy.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Key is in the Dialogue,"A different kind of film, 'Annie Hall' is steady but steadfast in delivering a genuinely welcoming and engaging romantic comedy.Woody Allen presents a quirky but controlled character with real human merit and manners that make him likeable. Diane Keaton makes for an acceptable accompaniment with equal measures of grace and charm.It's quite a hard film to recall because it doesn't really deliver as a cinematic movie, instead feels akin to a play you would enjoy on a practical performing arts theatre.At times its cheapness and lack of intensity can be boring, but there is something to be said for these types of films - the time when they made good clean, humorous, and thoughtful movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"If movies were beers, this would be ""Finster Light!""","A few years back at a birthday party for my grandmother, I noticed that there was one other large party in the restaurant.  While they were quiet with proper etiquette and table manners, we were animated and boistrous with a minimum of two arguments per 15 minutes.  I turned to my mother and said ""It's just like the Halls and the Singers.""  You can tell that Annie Hall was one of Woody Allen's older movies based on the character he plays.  As Alvy Singer, Allen plays a short neurotic Jewish New Yorker who is obsessed with death.  ""Sun's bad for you.  Everything your parents say is good for you is bad for you.  Sun, milk, red meat, college..."" By contrast, Diane Keaton plays the title character, a pretentious WASP who is obsessed with life and her favourite expression is ""La-de-dah.""  Oh yeah, she just happens to be Allen's girlfriend.  The movie serves as an introspective commentary on the evolution of a relationship, and how Alvy Singer perceives his rapport with Annie Hall.  For instance, is her family truly a clan on anti-Semites, or is that just how Alvy envisions them?  The movie costars Tony Roberts, Carol Kane, and Paul Simon, with a guest appearance by Marshall McLuhan as himself.  One can see that it had a profound affect on the postmodern entertainment industry, as many aspects of the relationship between George and Susan on Seinfeld can be traced back to Annie Hall.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Annie Hall review,"Annie Hall was a solid movie. I just saw it for the first time the other day after I heard about it before and it had struck my interest. I thought the movie was pretty funny. Woody allen had me laughing with the things he says and how he says things. He's negative, sarcastic, and kind of a smart ass, but man does he get me laughing. I don't think its meant to be super hilarious but i found his character pretty funny to watch throughout the movie. The picture of the movie looked phenomena,l when i saw it i kept forgetting how long ago the movie came out. I wasn't even close to being born yet. I've always heard about this movie but i had really no idea or care until recently when i heard about it in class. A few people told me it wasn't good but i thought it was a pretty damn good movie. Diane Keaton is in it as well and she's solid as usual. I think she's one of the best actresses.

Little epic,"Reviewing Fellini's ""Casanova"", Pauline Kael wrote, that it's impossible for a director to make a successful epic about himself. With ""Annie Hall"", Allen didn't just become first director to accomplish that, he was the first successful case of a person to just stand before camera, and tell the world about himself. Allen makes what other directors were afraid of: he shows all of his cards, he hides nothing. His message is: ""Here I am, a little man, telling you about my views on everything from sex to politics. Some of them are trivial, some original, but I don't care--take it or leave it"". ""Annie Hall"" could be so incredibly bad, but it wasn't. It is a masterpiece not in a sense that it's a very good film, it's rather one of those cases where you accept it for what it is.It's really simple, yes, but like with all Allen's films, it's simplicity borders with perfection. It's obvious that Allen was set to make a ""serious"" movie, but, like many times after, didn't. Instead, we got one of the funniest and honest films ever made. Maybe word masterpiece shouldn't be applied to ""Annie Hall"", but in his own half-baked way, Allen made the perfect self-portrait.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Annie Hall,"Stand-up comic ""Alvy"" (Woody Allen) has a lively history with the women in his life. His marriages - of which there have been two - have all ended rather suddenly, as has his latest dalliance with the eponymous singer (Diane Keaton) who won't have sex with him unless she gets high first! Now this latest failure perplexes him. He thinks that over the years he would have managed to iron out the frailties in his character and so, by now, be able to retain the affections of a woman. What keeps going wrong? Woody Allen did pretty much everything on this production so is able to well focus the self-deprecating Jewish humour that threads through the feature as well as using the retrospective nature of the story telling to quite amusingly but also entirely plausibly assess not just ""Alvy"" but what scenarios from his life, loves, upbringing and choices helped mould the man into that rather flawed creature we now see before us. At times it is a little wordy, and he does recourse to in-jokes once or twice too many, but for the most part this is a confidently pitched double-hander with two actors who have an unique sort of on/off on-screen chemistry that makes this an engaging and enjoyable ninety minutes that might well ring true in many a bedroom.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I Lurv ""Annie Hall."" I Luff It (with Two ""F""s).....","Woody Allen grew up with ""Annie Hall,"" his at-the-time unconventional romance about two insecure but lovable New Yorkers. There's a distinct line dividing the films he had made up to that point, all of them really a 1970s equivalent to the screwball comedies of the 1930s. ""Annie Hall"" brought him respect and admiration from the ""serious"" film community (in other words, the film won Oscars), and Allen's movies were different from that point forward.Allen uses a complex narrative structure to tell what is in essence a simple story, using flashbacks and forwards, and integrating devices that in his earlier movies had simply been gimmicks (like talking directly into the camera) seamlessly into his story. But all of that aside, the strength of ""Annie Hall"" is due to the wonderful characters Allen wrote, and the delightful performances of him and, especially, Diane Keaton, who plays Annie divinely. When Keaton first introduces us to Annie, she's a dingbat full of eccentric tics. But over the course of the film she evolves into a complicated, vulnerable yet tough woman who all too realistically outgrows Allen's character, Alvy Singer, a neurotic comedian who thinks every single person he comes in contact with is harboring hidden anti-Semitic tendencies. ""Annie Hall"" gives a perfect illustration of how two people who are right for each other in so many ways just can't make a relationship work. It's funny as hell at times, but it's predominant tone is one of nostalgic melancholy.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny and witty romantic comedy. That has nice flashbacks and intelligent dialogue.,"To me 1977's ""Annie Hall"" is nothing great, it's just really an okay picture a romantic comedy with laughs and wit. I guess though one must hand it to Woody Allen for the way he done the film by telling the struggles of relationships in life and for his comparing of situations to the use of flashbacks to draw references. This film shows the differences between male and female ways, the dialogue is sharp and intelligent with references often to art and pop culture and Allen isn't afraid to show that most of these characters have strong liberal beliefs in dealing with social and political matters. My favorite line is masturbation is I love myself! The acting performances are good with Allen as a neurotic and nervous New York city comedian Alvy Singer who finds enjoyment finally with love by romancing a woman named Annie Hall a city club singer. I must say that Diane Keaton gave a bold and strong independent performance here with this role of Annie. Really this isn't the greatest film made, but it's good with a unique and intelligent take from Allen for the way he did it by flashbacks, monologues, one-liners, and even cartoon animation really a wacky way to showcase love and romance.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's All About The Dialogue,"I could easily write for more than 1,000 words about Annie Hall, because the film is of such a high standard of quality that it deserves to be written about. The film is simply amazing. The dialogue between Alvy (Woody Allen) and all of the other characters, portrays what a relationship really is, not just between a man and a woman, but between a man and his family, his in-laws, his co-workers and his audience. The film is filled with comedy from start to finish as well, from the scene where Alvy complains about how a fellow movie-goer shouts his opinions too loud, to when Christopher Walken's character explains how his mind works, this is the funniest film I've ever seen. It's amazing what Allen managed to do with such a small budget. He made a film filled with all the wonder you could ask from a big-budget high profile comedy, but used dialogue that matters instead of gross-out humor.Bottom line: This is the best romantic comedy that will ever be and is one of the most entertaining experiences of my lifetime.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Annie Hall,"In the late 1970s and early 1980s watching a Woody Allen film was like a visit to the doctor who gives you some foul tasting medicine. Ultimately it was good for you. Most film critics at the time lionised Woody especially when he started to make his films in black and white.I last saw Annie Hall some 30 years ago. Nowadays I can watch some low rent movie and completely forget everything about it a few months later. When I rewatched Annie Hall recently I could recall some of the gags and scenes such as Marshall McLuhan being dragged out to dismiss the opinions of some smart alec or the weird outburst by Christopher Walken who plays Annie's brother or Allen sneezing on some cocaine. Of course the film was famous with Diane Keaton's masculine fashion sense.Annie Hall started out as a murder mystery that morphed into a bittersweet romantic comedy. It sees the shift from Woody Allen making silly comedies to a self reverential continental European type comedy. There is certainly an influence of Fellini here.Annie Hall comes across as a semi autobiographical comedy and even darkly surreal. Woody plays comedian Alvy Singer. He has just turned 40 and recounts his doomed romantic relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton.) Alvy comes from a loud Jewish family. Annie is from a waspish even anti semitic family. Alvy is educated, neurotic who sees a shrink. Annie is easy going, likes to smoke dope. Alvy encourages Annie to take adult education classes, later he is jealous as she spends more time with one of her tutors.There is so much to enjoy here. Alvy's rapid fire wit and neurosis. He thinks someone is being anti semitic by the way he pronounces 'do you' to make it sound like Jew. Alvy breaks the fourth wall, there is animation and subtitles. When Aly and Annie talk to each other, the subtitles indicate what they are thinking including Alvy wondering what she looks like without her clothes.When Alvy is waiting for Annie to arrive for their date, he is accosted by two strange men. When Annie pulls up in a taxi, Alvy tells Annie that he has been harrassed by two men from the Godfather. Of course the audience knows that Keaton appeared in the Godfather films.There are several stars who make brief early appearances in this film. Apart from Walken, there is Sigourney Weaver and Jeff Goldblum.Woody Allen won the best director Oscar and the film beat Star Wars for the best film Oscar. Annie Hall is an oddball film and it works ultimately because of Diane Keaton.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny....At Times,"Annie Hall was 1977's Best Picture winner at the Oscars. I don't think it should have been. It was a solid movie for sure, but I couldn't buy the movie as the best film of 1977. While Woody Allen's Bananas was a screwball comedy, this film does mark Allen's most mature film up to this point. The comedy is still there, but the movie is deeper than in Allen's previous efforts. Allen cited advancing age for his more philosophical views (as he turned forty in 1975 which gave him strong opinions about death.) These philosophical views involves what it means to be romantic, Jewish heritage, the ideas of getting older, the banality of life, and of course as in most Allen's film, a love story to the great city of New York. It also has been told that the movie resembles the personal life of Woody Allen. I wouldn't find that surprising because he did date the star of the film, Diane Keaton at one point. I thoroughly enjoyed the philosophical views that Allen had in the film.That also comes to the crux of my problems I had with the film. All the philosophy is fine and dandy, but people don't realize how much this film is talking. People call this film a masterpiece, but they fail to see that this film is 121 minutes of talking and walking. I was mesmerized by Allen's incredible dialogue, but eventually the talk wore me out (which is hard to do). This is a major issue, but luckily for the film it was the only issue I had. Too much talk, but the words were incredibly fluid thanks to the thoughtful script by Allen. There are some memorable monologues, and I liked how Allen spoke to the camera. It is rare for a movie to have an actor speak to the camera in a successful way, but Allen made it work here. He created a romantic comedy that made people laugh, and also made people cry. It represented more of a mature side to him that people seldom saw before this. Sure his screwball antics are still here, but his maturity level was elevated by several notches.Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is a neurotic stand-up comedian who reflects on the demise of his last relationship. He dated a woman named Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) who was an aspiring nightclub singer. Alvy reflects over the good times and bad times over the course of their relationship and also on factors that caused this relation to happen. He talks about growing up near C0ney Island, how he had sexual desires from a very young age, and how he always felt guilty about his Jewish heritage growing up.I've seen this movie twice. The first time, it took awhile for me to appreciate Woody Allen's acting in this film. This time, I was instantly brought in to the story by his inner monologue. Allen is essentially playing himself with lots of rapid intellectual dialogue. But I enjoyed watching him piece out the information on why his relationship failed. I really did like how be added depth to his character. He may be funny, but it's not all about the comedy this time around. Diane Keaton, whom we know from The Godfather, does very well in her role. Her character is somewhat based off herself she admitted. Her character is shy, insecure at times, but she's sweet and honest. There are some good supporting roles here too. We get to see a young Christopher Walken as Annie's brother Duane. We see two other women that Alvy got into relationships with and they were performed decently from Carol Kane and Shelley Duvall. Also, there are two blink-or-you-miss cameos in the film. Keep any eye out for Jeff Goldblum and Signourey Weaver! Overall, I enjoyed watching what is probably Woody Allen's most personal movie. He later admitted he was not happy with the film because it was not the film he intended to make. But that didn't stop critics and audiences alike all around the world from calling Annie Hall the best movie of 1977. Unfortunately, I do not share that sentiment. I do, however, think this film is a good watch. It's funny at times, but it is also a thoughtful film. I would even call it a semi-experimental film. It's a film that you need to pay utmost attention to or you'll be lost. The story is not linear because there are mnay flashbacks spread throughout. Only Woody Allen could create enough witty and strong dialogue where you wouldn't need action to complement those words. For that reason alone, this film is deserving of its Best Screenplay Oscar win. This movie is a solid watch thanks to a strong, intelligent screenplay and very strong performances from Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. However, it falls short from the masterpiece everyone claims it to be.My Grade: B",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
4 things that I didn't like about this movie.,"A lot of reviews here already include how good this film is. I agree mostly that this is one of the movies that every film-lover should watch at least one.I want to add here the reasons what I didn't like about this movie:1-) Woody Allen's acting is not good. He is exaggerating his act. While he is trying to act natural, he is far from convincing the audience for his role. I don't know what happened in 1978 Oscar nominee discussions but his nomination for Best Actor is ridiculous.2-) Alvy Singer is a disturbingly wordy character. He never stops talking and shaking his head.3-) On the other hand, Diane Keaton is too dull for the Annie Hall character. She is supposed to be a lively, outgoing, curious...character but Diane Keaton fails to reflect these feelings to the audience.4-) Sub characters are too weak. They have minimum screen times. I think it would be better to detail more the other characters like. Rob, Allison,Tony Lacey and even Pam.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Exaggerated,"As a matter of fact, Woody Allen is not my favorite director or actor. I prefer not to watch his movies. Let's be honest, I watched it because it was in the imdb top 250. I mean, I don't know, it's an exaggerated movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
This could well be the Woodmeister's finest hour,"When I first saw ""Annie Hall"" back in 1977 I voted it the most over-rated film of the year. As Alvy and Annie would say, 'God, what a schmuck'. What I didn't realize then was that I was watching a masterpiece and one of the funniest films ever made. Time has been kind to ""Annie Hall"" and I guess I must have been suffering from anhedonia, that inability to experience pleasure and the title Woody was originally planning to use. Seeing it today, the jokes not only seem funnier but legendary with it, (hindsight is a great thing). Perhaps they have passed into our sub-conscious and it takes very little to bring them to the fore. But then, in 1977, we didn't really have a yardstick to compare it with. We knew Woody could write good comedy; ""Love and Death"" showed he wasn't just very funny but clever and sophisticated as well but none of his films before ""Annie Hall"" showed this kind of cinematic sensibility. ""Annie Hall"" is great, not just because it is a great comedy but because it shows a great film-maker hitting pay-dirt and in hindsight it may be safe to say he never again quite achieved that miraculous blend of comic timing and filmic brilliance, at least not on this level. The Academy voted it the Best Picture of its year and gave Woody their director's prize, (and another for writing it), as well as giving Diane Keaton the prize for Best Actress; it was to their credit and among their finest hours.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I'm Not With the In Crowd- Annie Hall Takes A Fall *,"I was in the minority when I saw 1977's Oscar winner for best picture. I just didn't like. When it was on last night, I decided to give it a second chance. After all, it's 29 years since I saw it. Guess what? This time I hated it.To begin with, I am tired of Woody Allen's attempt to philosophize life with his relationship with women and the fact that he is a self-deprecating Jew. He has constantly knocked the latter in many of his films. This is not appreciated.In this film, he surprisingly knocks New York. He goes to California but that's not for him either. Basically speaking Mr. Allen, what is for you?The plot here is weigh too thin. Allen plays the usual jerk in search of meaning for his life. Along the way, he meets Carol Kane at a Stevenson rally. He claims that what he wants to do with women is what Eisenhower has been doing to the country for 8 years. By the way, no one corrected the fact that Ike was not president for 2 terms when Stevenson ran against him. There are term limits since 1951 Woody!The film is tedious and often full of clichés. How many times must we be remembered what Jews are thought of by mid-westerners?I can't fathom how this stinker of a movie was given the Oscar for best picture. ""The Turning Point,"" as well as ""Star Wars,"" and ""Julia,"" along with ""The Goodbye Girl"" were far superior films. Diane Keaton acted like a typical mid-west ""shiksa."" Her hats and clothing were outrageous. She did sing nicely. Nonetheless, Marsha Mason (""The Goodbye Girl"") and Shirley MacLaine or Anne Bancroft were far better in ""The Turning Point.""For my part, ""Annie Hall"" takes a mighty fall here. Allen suffers from going aimlessly through life. He is afraid to take a chance. Too bad that he did with this film.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Annie Hall,"I never really was a fan of Woody Allen films. Mainly because they tend to kind of depressing, but i recently realized that he has a very unique way at hitting the key points of life as a general term. While being his corky, weird, and sometimes overwhelmed self you somehow feel sympathy for the things he does. He is a man who stands true to himself while being as nice as any man could. What i enjoyed most about this film was the way he attempts to put himself and the audience along with him, inside of his memories. The idea of putting his present self literally in the scene of his memories is one thing, but to have his present self talk directly to the audience when this is happening is something I found really interesting. Not to many people have done this in my opinion and its a unique way to add some comic relief.This film, unlike many of the other films composed in New York City, gave the city life style a more positive look. Many of the city films consist of anger and violence while this one took a more emotional approach. It kind of makes it seam more realistic or easier to put yourself in the composition of the director.",,Anonymous,Romance
Love Story: Woody Allen Style,"Woody Allen's, ""Annie Hall"" which has a tag line ""A nervous romance"" is a story of two New Yorkers who truly loved each other but could not stay together and eventually and inevitably moved on with their lives. Simple like that but it was told by Woody Allen, which made it not so simple and very enjoyable. This is the film where Diane Keaton proved to be a perfect actress for Allen's movies. She brought to the film a lot of herself, her natural nervousness and insecure attitude, even her dressing style that became hugely popular. She played Annie with such bemusement, perfect timing, and natural sense of humor, that for the whole time the viewers can't help asking themselves how she did it. The part of the answer is that Allen understood her completely and masterfully used the originality of her persona to write and direct the character of Annie. Keaton recalls, ""Of course I recognized myself in the roles Woody Allen wrote. I mean, in Annie Hall (1977) particularly. I was this sort of novice who had lots of feelings but didn't know how to express herself, and I see that in Annie. I think Woody used a kind of essential quality that he found in me at that time, and I'm glad he did because it worked really well in the movie.""For Annie Hall, Allen received his first and only Oscar nomination for acting, and he deserved it. You may say that you've seen all his tricks many times but Annie Hall was the first movie where he mixed physical comedy, anxiety, and neurosis with the genuine feelings of love and nostalgia especially touchingly and funny. Engaging the audience to the film by talking directly to them may not be used for the first time ever by Allen but it worked perfectly in Annie Hall. Who would forget the scene in the ticket booth in an art house movie cinema where Woody summons up Marshall McLuhan to silence a self-important movie critic who just would not shut up? The flashbacks are smart and witty, the split screen technique that Allen uses, really adds to the characters' understanding by comparison two parallel streams of thought. Both, NYC and its antitheses, LA look gorgeous. Even the smallest cameos are memorable. Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum, for example, made their early appearances in Annie Hall.The fascination and love that the film received upon its release had to do a lot with the fact that it was so different from everything Allen had done before Annie Hall. Checking the list of his earlier movies, one can't help noticing that they were pure slapstick comedies. The only earlier film that can be called Annie Hall's true predecessor is the one that Allen did not direct even though he wrote it, starred in it and for the first time shared the screen with Diane Keaton - Play it Again, Sam. As the first Allen's romantic dramedy, the one that had started the whole genre of independent and sophisticated urban love stories with an unusual, over self-involved and self-obsessed lead hero who is not always likable but nevertheless is always ready to be the first to laugh at himself, Annie Hall has found the high place in the film history.Critics have compared Annie Hall to Fellini's 8 1/2 but Woody responded in his typical way that ""it's more like my 2 1/2"". The members of the academy did not think so, and rewarded the film with 5 Oscar nominations, of which it won four, making Annie Hall one of very few comedies to have won the Best Picture of the year Oscar and the shortest ever Oscar winner - 93 precious minutes of Woody Allen's genius and Diane Keaton's charming nervousness.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One day when I'm awfully low...,"Probably one of the finest movies of the twentieth century ruminating on life, relationships and the pitfalls of romance. Nothing is forever but while you're here you might as well have a jolly good try at it. Allen brings in all the elements that makes relationships (or sharks) come stop moving - jealously, needs and wants, compromises, those thoughts of imaginary arguments when you really know what you want to say but never really said it - it's all here. And it's not a sad film either - we know from the start the relationship is over but that doesn't stop the viewer from enjoying every moment as if it were afresh. Beautifully made, this is a must for just about anyone who's ever had a tumultuous relationship and needs a breather/room for thought. Wonderful.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wow !! What a masterpiece I have watched !!,"Annie hall is romantic comedy film with unusual and compelling story telling technique .Watcher will feel like woody allen is just having a casual conversation with him .. Soulmate is myth thus relation goes through struggle ,crisis, incompatibility. Doesn't matter who is your partner she might be someone you wanted or didnt want, you can't avoid the side effect of romance ..Director tried to show those inevitable crisis in a satire framework . People might pretend various charismatic persona in society but when it comes to romantic relationship it is so difficult to hide real flawed persona which causes dillema and crisis .Woody allen here played the role of a pessimistic ,over thinker and anxiety disorder guy who sees conspiracies and complexities in everything .I enjoyed every monologue in this film . Those were captivating and totally situational. This one is best ..I feel that life is divided into the horrible and the miserable. That's the two categories. The horrible are like, I don't know, terminal cases, you know, and blind people, crippled. I don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me. And the miserable is everyone else.

I founded it so fascinating in the beginning when he talks back to himself as a child in the classroom.

The end of an affair,"Woody Allen is comedian Alvy Singer.He's Jewish, he's neurotic and he lives in New York.He goes to a psychoanalysis to hear that Freudian mumbo jumbo, which is very helpful of course.Sounds like a Woody Allen movie to me.In the movie Alvy goes through his relationship history and what went wrong in them.He concentrates particularly on one of them, the one he had with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton).Of course Diane and Woody were actually going out and this is obviously a movie about their relationship.And Keaton's real name is Diane Hall.Woody's character speaks straight to the camera and steps into his past every now and then.He could go back to his childhood, listen to his parents quarrel or go sit in the classroom.That, I think is very well done in the movie.Woody Allen is a genius of movie making.Believe me, he is.Annie Hall (1977) is just terrific,wonderful, a masterpiece of romantic comedies.The dialogue, just listen to the dialogue and you know what I'm talking about.Every member of the cast is excellent, not just Allen and Keaton.I could mention Tony Roberts, Carol Kane, Shelley Duval, Janet Margolin, Paul Simon, Christopher Walken, Jonathan Munk.Jeff Goldblum and Sigourney Weaver pop in there.Truman Capote is seen walking looking like himself.I can recommend Annie Hall for all those reasons mentioned up there.Maybe you can think of some others.Just go watch the movie.Why are you wasting your time reading this review, this mumbo jumbo of mine?

I was surprised by how funny I still found this film,"It's a romantic comedy set in New York City and Los Angeles in the 1970s. It follows an uptight eccentric twice-divorced comedian in his 40s reflecting on the loss of the love of his life through flashbacks.Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is a scrawny, highly literate comedian. His father (Mordecai Lawner) ran rides at an amusement park near his Brooklyn home. His mother (Joan Newman) is a stereotypical Jewish mother. Alvy dumps his first wife, Allison (Carol Kane), because she's too needy. His second wife, Robin (Janet Margolin), leaves Alvy because she's not into his humor. Then he meets Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), a 30-ish flower child with aspirations to be a singer.The film follows their relationship's ups and downs and includes Alvy's talking to the audience and a display of their inner thoughts during their first conversation. Along the way, we meet Alvy's best friend, Rob (Tony Roberts), an actor in a network comedy series. We also meet Tony Lacey (Paul Simon), a big-time music producer from Los Angeles who is enamored with Anne. The film throughout portrays self-analysis by Alvy and Anne about their relationship. By the conclusion, the viewer will agree the ending was necessary.I've generally avoided Woody Allen movies in recent decades, partly because of his off-screen behavior and partially because the quality of his films dropped over the years. So I was surprised by how funny I still found this film. The chemistry between Allen and Keaton is excellent, and the movie's pacing is superb. Carol Kane and Paul Simon are a treat. Tony Roberts, not so much. It was fun to see Christopher Walken (Anne's brother in the film) in a pre-stardom role. And the cameo by Marshall McLuhan is a hoot.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Innovative and Convincing Study of Relationships,"Annie Hall, a film from back in 1977 and winner at the 1978 Academy Awards of the coveted Best Picture prize, is a film directed by Woody Allen. It tells the story, or rather shows the viewers scenes from the story, of how Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) falls in love with and carries on a relationship with none other than Annie Hall (Diane Keaton).The most innovative part of this film is its screenplay, so very unique in its randomness and in its straightforward quality. Allen isn't afraid to show exactly what Alvy is thinking, even if its means having him speak directly into the camera or showing his thoughts directly on screen. The film isn't about exciting moments and beautiful love scenes; rather, it's about two normal, abnormal people whose relationship is just as interesting as Hall and Singer themselves.The direction, although it too won an Oscar, is rather simple, but just as direct as the screenplay is. Really, the screenplay is the only element that is complicated and unique, but Allen wants that screenplay and all that introspective dialogue to be the viewer's focus. This explains the lack of music and lack of flamboyant camera techniques.For all the very, very funny parts of the film, there also seem to be a few large chunks of dialogue that leave the viewer scratching his head. The film isn't focused really, but I believe that it's focused in its blurriness. It focuses on Hall and Singer alone, not on a certain atmosphere; but what relationship does retain the same atmosphere throughout its entirety?The film is so fresh in its exploration of all relationships, not just that of Annie and Alvy. Allen is obviously frustrated with elusiveness of pleasure, especially emotional pleasure in relationships between men and women. It forces the viewer to reminisce on both the bad and the good, just as Singer himself does, even though most of us may not be quite so innovative in our display of memory.Final Grade: A-.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Annie Hall Review,"I love the various editing strategies used in this film. I like the constant flashbacks that are used to tell the back story but the interesting aspect of this is that the two main characters, Woody Allen and Diane Keaton, are always in present time having a conversation about the good old times in the flashback. These flashbacks told the story of how they got to be the people they were currently, and how they got to be in the relationship they currently were in. I though this was a cool and interesting way to tell the back story. I also like that Woody Allen is the main character, but also is doubling as the narrator. The camera will focus on him, and the background will go fuzzy and mute everyone else out, while he talks to the camera and engages the audience (you) into the story. The editing strategies, I think, made the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Outrageously funny, yet deeply poignant","Whether you like woody Allen and his alleged scandalous activities or not, he cannot be faulted for being a poor filmmaker. In his magnum opus, woody Allen portrays Alvy, a hilarious neurotic, intolerant man who falls in love with Annie hall. The filmmaking here is not exactly experimental, but exciting, as we have woody Allen constantly break the fourth wall, and shots of two events side by side which are parallel to each other in content. This style of filmmaking greatly adds to the personal nature of the film, allowing us to emphasise with Alvy, despite his neurotic tendencies. Diane Keaton also offers a marvellous portrayal as Annie Hall, who surprisingly gets a nice character arc, starting off as shy and very much dominated by the more outspoken and whiny Alvy, but ends up confident and self assured. Despite the witty writing and hilarious first rate comedy however, this is ultimately a sad film. Alvy does not end up with Annie in the end despite their supposed compatibility. The last scene in the film is strikingly poignant; we watch Alvie say goodbye to Annie for the last time, never to see her again. We feel sad by this moment, but Alvie reminds us that love is irrational and stupid, but very much necessary, and we very much feel like he had gotten over Annie, like most of us would have eventually if we were in his position.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A witty, well written, classic rom-com","Woody Allen is one of the most renounced comedy and romance directors around and iconised my many. His heyday was in the late 70s to the mid-80s and Annie Hall is often considered one of his best films.Alvy Singer (Allen) is a neurotic, paranoid, pessimistic, left comedian in New York City, with a thing for intelligentialism and lives a life of romantic self-sabotage and the film follows his relationship with singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), from the start to the end.Annie Hall is a dialogue driven comedy with a surreal edge to it with the ways it breaks the forth wall. Annie Hall is constantly witty with the jokes and dialogue exchanges between characters as it somehow finds the right balance between naturalism and comic thanks to the strength to the acting to making the writing as believable as possible.Allen uses a simple direction style, using as few cuts as possible and many scenes were played out in long takes. It is effective for letting the comedy and dialogue play out because the actors could interact without breaks or disruptions. It made the performances more organic. But Allen does bring in some directional flourishes with the way characters appear in flashbacks and how a couple of times how to scenes play out at the same time in a split screen. Annie Hall is a film that has been referred a number of times in numerous TV shows such as The Simpsons and Family Guy and for good reason.Annie Hall is made out to be a charming woman whom Keaton plays with ease. It is easy to see the appeal of this woman to men. But Alvy comes off being very selfish and self-centred despite his neurotises. He is really more concerned about himself and what Annie was able to bring to him. Annie was felt compelled to stay with Alvy.As well as the theme of romance, relationships and love Allen does also introduces themes about culture, both low end and high end. Allen is critical of both, with how Hollywood functions and the lifestyle, particularly how TV shows manipulate audiences in a very unsubtle jab against the industry. He also takes on takes up the pretentiousness of pseudo-intelligentialism showcased by some of Alvy's set and he looks down on it, yet he is also a part of this set with his ability to over thing.Annie Hall is a funny film that blends a natural, grounded situation that many people can relate to whilst telling it an unconventional way with its fourth wall breaking style and elements of insight into various characters minds in many different ways. It is a fine example of an excellently written script whilst telling a simple story. This is Woody Allen at his best.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Delightful and whimsical,"1. Its very easy to see the influence Annie Hall had on Larry David and therefore Seinfeld. You could smack George Costanza in half the scenes replacing Alvy Singer and the movie would run much the same.2. This film is an absolute delight. Woody Allen's performance as the neurotic New York comedian with a constant ear for Anti-Semitism is actually quite endearing in its tiny 90 minute run time. That being said, he's a completely arrogant about himself and his city, and thanks to Allen's marvellous performance behind and in front of the camera, we can see just how his relationship ended.3. That's what Annie Hall is really about; it is a black box for a relationship that crashed somewhere over Utah. With that in mind, no scene feels wasted in either establishing their relationship or establishing the breakup.4. That scene where Alvy sneezes into the cocaine is one of the most hilarious unscripted moments in history. Apparently the test audience loved it so much that Allen had to put in fluff scenes afterwards to give them time to laugh without missing anything. That was a wise call.5. Allen's directorial decisions are amazing - spots of animation and split screen and fourth wall breaking, but most of all the way he can bring his intricate screenplay to life is the most impressive. A director not intrinsically linked with the screenplay would have found it almost impossible to weave the overlapping dialogue together.6. The screenplay is utterly wonderful, full of delightful gems like ""hey don't knock masturbation, its sex with someone I love.""7. Dianne Keaton is a delight as the titular character. She's a cute free spirit who is both completely right and completely wrong for Alvy Singer.8. The ending for the film is so perfect, especially Alvy's foray into theatre and how he manipulates events. His wry acknowledgement to the audience makes him more human than most rom com protagonists.9. It is actually hilarious to see brief appearances by Christopher Walken, Jeff Goldblum and Sigourney Weaver.10. Annie Hall is a worthy Best Picture winner. Though I love Star Wars more, I weigh up what each film's legacy in the film industry is and I can't begrudge this little film. Star Wars has inspired lots of CGI crap and Annie Hall inspired Seinfeld and Meet the Parents.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of Woody Allen's best,"I've only seen two Woody Allen movies up to now and I can already state that he is one of my favorite directors.

However, then I saw ""Annie Hall"" and I realized just how good a director he really was.  He won an Oscar for best director in this movie and really deserved it.  Diane Keaton also won an Oscar as best actress in the movie which she also deserved.  The movie is funny entertaining and doesn't drag.  Actually it would be pretty for the movie if it dragged because it only lasts an hour and a half.The story starts off with Woody Allen telling two jokes back to back. Then, he suddenly becomes a man named Alvy Singer and starts telling us the story of his relationship with a woman named Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). Along the flashbacks, we see what kind of relationships he had with other women.  And all along these adventures, he manages to squeeze in a ton of laughs.  He finally gets to how his relationship with Annie Hall began.  One day, after a tennis match with his friends where Annie was playing, he met her after the game.  They talked a little and then Alvy asked her if she could give him a lift.  On the way back, Alvy probably lost the taste of wanting to be in the car that Annie is driving.Some of you could consider this to be typical Woody Allen stuff, but even if you're right, it's great stuff.  What's also great about the Woody Allen movies is that in a scene in which he is playing but somebody else in speaking, it's always important to look at his face to get a funny figure or a grimace on his face.  The best part of his jokes is how he is able to tell them without even smiling.  Finally, throughout the whole movie, we see the love he has for New-York city.  If it hadn't been for the script-writer, he would have spent the whole movie in New-York.  It's a terrific movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"lovable film  but of course, ""love"" is too weak a word for what I feel. I luff this film.","Annie Hall happens to be one of those strange little films that can tell its story in a jagged way but audiences will still feel satisfied and most importantly, know what's going on. Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is a neurotic Jewish comedian who is short on romance. He chronicles his relationship with a ditzy and fairly neurotic girlfriend, Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). The film starts in the middle of their relationship, showing how similar Alvy and Annie are and at the same time how different they are. Alvy loves New York, as Annie wants something more, seeing that she wants a singing career.Allen, who co-written and directed the film, uses film like it was never used before. His character, Alvy, often talks to the camera, imagines a scene that may include animation, text on the screen that show what the characters are thinking, split screens, walking through a certain scene from the past and not really having the thoughts go in a certain coherent fashion. But that is when his originality shines. He is able to mix all his ideas plus constant dialogue. I don't really remember a scene where there is a huge moment where the characters aren't interacting to each other or muttering because this is something that film really needs today. I think there are too many films where the characters just give so-called meaningful glares at each other  talking is what people do and Allen emphasizes that into his script perfectly.The performances are a great breath of fresh air. Woody Allen, who is very much underrated as an actor is really good here. His character has the most lines and he really transforms into this character. If Allen is really like this, I don't know. One of my favorite actresses, Diane Keaton, is what we are missing from actresses today. She has versatility that is really hard to find and she shows how her resume can span from The Godfather to Annie Hall. Personally, I think Keaton has more versatility than Johnny Depp. So why did Star Wars lost Best Picture in 1978? Because Annie Hall simply had better performances, a greater insight of late-1970s relationships, and made every single scene quite memorable if not meaningful.One thing people must know is that I absolutely hate romantic-comedies. Watching a romantic comedy to me is like burning myself alive in the fire. But I rather enjoyed this story  it was nice, sweet, and surprisingly likable. I like how it was not told in the traditional form of how other films usually have done it. I like the addition to the split screens, the animation sequence, the ""talking to the camera,"" etc. Even though this film has those ""wtf?"" moments, I still happened to like it very much (yes, I loave it). Those are the tiny delights that are rare in today's film-making society.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It Works Despite Itself,"Woody Allen's ""Annie Hall"" works despite some flaws mostly in Allen's direction. This is likely due to the fact that Allen wasn't entirely sure what the film was going to be about but the film editor Ralph Rosenblum was instrumental in putting all the pieces together. It doesn't matter how it was put together: the final product is terrific. I wish I could watch it fresh all over again. It's comedic scenes are unpredictable, Allen's one liners are often priceless. It is partly an autobiography (of sorts) about Allen that morphs into focusing on his relationship to Diane Keaton as Annie Hall. Keaton is tremendous here. She possesses everything a star actor needs: she's charming, pretty and smart. She captures the audiences affections early on and that is key to the film's success. ""Annie Hall"" is the only one of Allen's films that really feels human. The ending is truly touching, an achievement that Allen rarely was able to achieve (though he often tried very hard to).",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Neither entertaining nor a masterpiece of film making.,"The Academy Awards Broadcast in 1978 charted one of the top 3 Oscar tune-ins ever, and I've no doubt if Best Picture had been the first presented award of the night it would have also charted the largest and fastest viewers tune-out in history.Annie hall is no more than a dressed up romantic comedy, the only new twist even for the time was that he didn't get the girl. I am surprised that it took her that long to realise that he is a winging, inconsiderate, and negative little pessimist. He uses gags like the sub text communicating thoughts, and talking to people in the street like a roving reporter to hide the fact that otherwise he has a tiring, run-of-the-mill screenplay.He prattles on with ""meaning of life"" drivel all through the movie which is another vain attempt to bring depth to this sickly uninteresting flick. One true highlight is seeing Jeff Goldblum make a one line appearance at the party towards the end.And the now notorious times when he narrates, talking to the camera that have been sent up numerous times since, he looks dead set like he is acting, he tries to assume a nervous air air but it comes off as a presumptive performance. I know it is tradition for academy members to nominate the lead actor in the flick you are voting Best Picture but in this case it is a great detraction from the credibility of the Academy. The movie is neither entertaining nor a masterpiece of film making. Handing it Best Picture over the entertainment giant Star Wars was beyond ridiculous. It really does just have nothing to recommend it.",,Anonymous,Romance
Some experience required,"It is a common feature of myself to allow some films simmer after I watch them, meaning taking a significant amount of time before I sit down and begin to review them. Woody Allen's Annie Hall is definitely one of those films that needs to come to a full stop before I can fully analyze it. Getting up from it, I was convinced that I had seen something relating to the concept of ""art,"" but couldn't quite magnify it in a reasonable context. I think I finally found the proper way.The plot is paper thin, with characters who make up the structure of the picture by their eclectic personalities. Woody Allen is Alvy Singer, a neurotic, self-loathing comedian always putting himself on the lower end of the pedestal. He meets Annie Hall (Keaton), a beautiful, refreshingly different woman, one who dreams of being a devout singer, who seems to be just what Alvy needs; an outgoing, adventurous, yet too somewhat neurotic, woman, fearlessly different and shamelessly content.Inevitably, Alvy's paranoia consumes him, and his angst towards people and society, which leads to a certain hesitation with dating Annie. She seems to be almost too good for Alvy in the respect that he is so jittery and paranoid, that she deserves better, and he deserves inferior. He explains that among other points through the film's most unique features. As a method to actually talk to the audience, Allen's character will provide narrations, give lengthy monologues to the camera, bravely breaking the fourth wall, showing us brilliantly crafted fantasies (one of the funniest takes place in a movie theater), and even giving us a well drawn animated sequence.One can see why the film bested Star Wars for the Best Picture win in 1977. The Academy always seeks out the most diversely original and esthetically different picture, and they always try and tactfully avoid giving out awards to a big budget blockbuster, much like how The Hurt Locker bested Cameron's Avatar in 2009.As a whole, Annie Hall is a delight, but I believe it's one of those films that will become better, at least for me, with age and personal experience. It seems that at this point in time, I haven't hit the proper notes to be able to personally connect with this film, in terms of being self-conscious in a relationship and constant fear of societal inferiority because of motifs. While I thoroughly enjoyed Annie Hall, and found the performances, writing, and direction and tone to be all of top notch and commendable status, the personal connection, which I believe the film depends rather heavily on, is unfortunately not present. I can see this being revisited optimistically in ten or so years with experience.Starring: Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. Directed by: Woody Allen.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody's Masterpiece,"ANNIE HALL (1977) **** Woody Allen, Diane Keaton, Tony Roberts, Shelley Duvall, Colleen Dewhurst, Christopher Walken, Carol Kane, Janet Margolin. Some say this is Woody's best film and I'm hard-pressed to differ: chronic New York neurotic/comedy writer Alvy Singer can't commit to anything except his own misery and falls in love (and meets his match in psychoses) with Annie Hall (Keaton in her Oscar-winning role), the Waspy flibbertigibbet who wants more out of life but she's not sure what. Oscars also for Allen's direction, his screenplay (co-written by Marshall Brickman) and Best Picture. Gorgeously shot in black and white by Gordon Willis. Look quickly for Jeff Goldblum's cameo (""I forgot my mantra"") at Paul Simon's So. Cal. Party, John Glover in a flashback party scene with Annie, Shelley Hack in a sidewalk scene, veteran character actor Tracey Walter and Beverly D'Angelo in the sitcom tape Roberts is sweetening with a laugh track in an edit bay, Woody's longtime friend and future producer Jean Doumanian in the coke scene, and at the film's end Sigourney Weaver (trust me it's her, but it is in a long shot and no dialogue) as Alvy's latest girlfriend.

It's easily one of the most comical Woody Allen Films and almost everyone's favourite and very understandably so.,"It's easily one of the most comical Woody Allen Films and almost everyone's favourite and very understandably so.I have seen this earlier and now I watched it again today, just to review it and when you look at a movie you will see it completely and observe each detail. So now, I loved the experience more than ever. Woody Allen made movie before this and after this, but this stands as his own in every which way. This is where he began, coming to his own and showing us a film grammar that many of us were not acquainted with.It's the relationship between Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) an Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) that the film is all about and how they stick together and even move on in different paths. Now, it's a relation of a middle aged couple in their forties and yet it's so innovative that they behave much worse than even teenagers today. They are immature, innocent, indulgent and running for their own egos making up their own reasons. It's all funny and so very innovative too.Woody Allen makes us audience indulge into the film by talking to them too. It's those long monologues or those fast paced and stammering dialogues, and those intelligent innuendos. The ""Death In Venice"" dialogue was a great one to laugh at. And there are so many too, I don't want to reveal them all here please. It's fun to watch them and laugh at them.Two superb performances, with great editing work done and superb dialogues and brilliant direction that is what makes it a masterpiece. There is a lot of incoherence and yet it's very very good indeed. Diane Keaton and Woody Allen are funny and cute while others have supported well. Look at the way Woody Allen asks the people in the film asking question on road side and that's a thing only he can do, salutations to Allen again and again and again.It's a 5/5 for not so perfect film but it's one that will stay in the memory for long time an it will get you back to it for it's dialogue and for the Allenish touch.

On Keaton's portrayal of Annie Hall,"Diane Keaton's portrayal of Annie Hall in Woody Allen's 1977 film of the same name, one of the most striking aspects of her performance is her use of body language and gestures. Monahan says in Looking at Movies, ""the camera serves as the actor's most important collaborator, allowing for a level of intimacy and naturalism impossible on stage"" (244). Keaton uses her entire body to communicate Annie's nervous energy and insecurity. Her fidgety movements, the way she wrings her hands, and her slightly hunched posture all contribute to our understanding of Annie's self-doubt and social anxiety. These physical cues are particularly effective in close-ups, where the camera can capture even the smallest gestures, allowing the audience to read deeply into Annie's emotional state.Facial expressions play a crucial role in Keaton's performance as well. Monahan says, ""actors must focus on the communicative power of even the slightest facial gesture""(259). Her ability to shift from understanding to annoyance when Anne is dealing with Singer's sarcastic remarks all within a single shot, adds emotional complexity to Annie's character. These nuanced expressions are particularly effective in Singer's ""monologue"" scenes, where the lack of lines on Keaton's part give space for her to convey Annie's thoughts and reactions with facial expressions.Speech is another distinctive element of Keaton's portrayal. Keaton delivers a naturalistic performance when speaking. Annie's speech patterns, filled with ""ums"" and ""you knows,"" and her self-deprecating humor all contribute to the character's vulnerability and insecurity. Keaton combines hesitant speech with nervous gestures and expressive facial movements, giving us a full picture of Annie's internal struggle.While all elements of Keaton's performance contribute significantly to Annie's character, it's the seamless integration of body language, facial expressions, and unique speech patterns that truly distinguishes her portrayal, creating a character whose thoughts and internal complexities are vivid and relatable.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Comedy from Terror, A Sweet Melancholy","The feeling in that ending scene, the irony of his casual attitude. He says, ""It was great to see Annie."" The feeling inside him that motivates that statement is closer to the opposite of the literal meaning of those words. It wasn't great to see Annie. It was a reminder of all that has been lost, that he has lost, that it did not all turn out okay, that the impossibility of love is no longer a terrifying nightmare of skepticism, that it is actually the truth. All of Allen's jokes come from that terror, that terror that after all, in the end, life, from the widest and most real perspective, is empty, and that meaning is thin and contingent and constructed, rather than intrinsic and independently valid. Life is divided into the terrible and miserableif you're miserable you should be grateful that you're not terrible.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Woody Allen's fresh, intelligent, and innovative romantic comedy.","With this film Allen had successfully made the transition from comedian to full blown auteur, and here he employs a variety of techniques and gimmicks - even animation - to create an unconventional way of looking at human relationships, and the neuroses that can ultimately damage them. It's very much his distinct voice, as he offers many musings on many topics, not just how people relate to each other, but the whole idea of N.Y.C. vs. L.A. He offers some juicy roles to a variety of familiar faces, and the actors make strong impressions no matter how brief their screen time might be. Certainly he gave the role of a lifetime to the endearing Diane Keaton, who firmly establishes a quirky and lovely screen persona.Allen plays Alvy Singer, a successful comedian who, through his friend Rob (Tony Roberts), makes the acquaintance of nightclub singer and aspiring actress Annie Hall (Ms. Keaton). The film charts the evolution of their romance and the various events that transpire to drive wedges between the two of them.In the meantime, there are some absolutely brilliant moments, especially as Allen plays with the conventions of movie-making, sometimes falling back on that old tradition of acknowledging the audience and really *involving* them. Particularly witty are the way Annie ""removes"" herself from a bout of lovemaking, the cameo by Marshall McLuhan, the flashbacks, flash forwards, subtitles to indicate the characters' internal monologues, and split screen. It's then no wonder that fans consider this to be the actor / filmmakers' finest film.Of course, it's also fun to play ""spot the familiar face"" with this large cast; the cast also includes Carol Kane, Paul Simon, Shelley Duvall, Janet Margolin, Colleen Dewhurst, and Christopher Walken, and in featured roles and bits the likes of John Glover, John Dennis Johnston, Laurie Bird, Jeff ""I forgot my mantra"" Goldblum, Shelley Hack, Beverly D'Angelo, Tracey Walter, and in a long shot near the end, Sigourney Weaver in her film debut.One will notice that there's no music score, but you'll hardly miss having one: the comedy and drama work well enough on their own without any sort of accompaniment.Eight out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Allen's Best Work,"In Allen's Annie Hall, he reveals his full potential as a filmmaker.  This is Allen's true breakthrough film.  Although still very humorous, Allen deals with issues of human interaction and relationships in Annie Hall that were not explored in his earlier works.  This has lead to creating a delightfully well-conceived and intelligent look at the lives of two people. 	 Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) is a young, Midwestern woman who meets Alvy Singer (Woody Allen), a neurotic Jewish standup comic.  They are almost instantly smitten, and they fall in love.  What follows is a very non-linear film about their relationship and feelings for each other.If one attempted to deconstruct Annie Hall's plot structure it would cause the film to not make sense.  It jumps hyperactively around in time and location and allows its narrator (Alvy Singer) to indulge in anecdotes that can sometimes feel detrimental to the driving plot point of the film: his relationship with Annie.  However, these comical asides all seem to link together as the film progresses and give us a clearer picture of Allen's overall statements on relationships. 	 The fact that Woody Allen is able to maintain the narrative complexity of Annie Hall while keeping the audience perfectly oriented is only one of the things about Annie Hall that make it so impressive.  Another aspect of it that is very satisfying and worth noting is the vivid cinematography by Gordon Willis.  He captures the sophistication of New York city by using a lighting concept similar to the one he used in The Godfather.  In fact, most of the visual elements of the film are very strong, including the art direction by Mel Bourne and clothing designed by fashion designer Ralph Lauren.  All of these elements converge to create a new and interesting New York look, that is at once authentic and slightly off kilter enough for this quirky comedy. 	 Of course, art direction and costume design wouldn't make this film worth watching if the performances in Annie Hall were poor.  Luckily enough for us, they're the opposite.  The interplay between Keaton and Allen crackles on the screen.  Their charisma is a joy to watch.  Although Woody Allen is just playing another version of his ""New Yorker neurotic Jew"" character that we have seen in other films, Diane Keaton really sinks her acting chops into the title role.  Her Annie goes through an evident intellectual transformation that Keaton pulls off very convincingly.  Allen is always funny as his neurotic persona and this is no exception.The rest of the acting in the film is convincing and enjoyable.  Allen has worked with his casting director Juliet Taylor in order to find incredibly entertaining and talented people for even the most minute of roles.  Some standout supporting characters include Carol Kane as Alison, one of Alvy's ex-girlfriends, and Christopher Walken in a brilliant comedic turn as Annie's brother Duane Hall.  His five minutes in the film is worth the price of admission alone.I couldn't really find anything wrong with Annie Hall.  All of its various facets converge to create a very entertaining film.  I always find Woody Allen's bickering ""Little Schlemiel"" anti-hero of a persona to be fascinating.  Finally, in this film he gives this little guy something really interesting to do.  We really get to enter Singer's neuroses in a way that is complexly satisfying and may remind us of ourselves and how we relate to others.  The audience is also never allowed to forget how infused these characters' lives are with sadness and comedy.  There are some bitterly funny scenes in Annie Hall that are startlingly reminiscent of our modern day reality.  Most of the audience can't help but identify.  For a thought provoking and highly entertaining video rental Annie Hall can't be beat.  It's the most intelligent movie comedy of it's decade.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A classically intellectual, yet heart-felt, approach to romantic comedy.","Intellectuals tend to over-think things sometimes, well, probably more like most of the time. This obsessive compulsion to analyze often brings nothing but disappointment, frustration, and cynicism. This, is Alvy Singer (Woody Allen), famous comedian ""looking for love in all the wrong places."" Or are they the right places, but Alvy won't let them be right? Is he afraid of a real relationship? Is the commitment too much for him? Does he fear the rejection and the disappointment? Who knows? Chances are, it's all of these things, and more. Allen's Alvy Singer is neurotic, so lost in his own fears and apprehensions that he cannot live his life. When he meets the beautiful, but awkwardly giddy Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), he decides to give romance another try. Annie, though, has some issues of her own. The two find solace in their similarities, yet the couple's neurotic nature tends to take a toll on them both, as the relationship continues through its ups and downs throughout the film. Told in retrospect, the film is a series of flashbacks and hilarious personal notes, chronicling the relationship of Annie and Alvy. There are plenty of great jokes and uncomfortable moments throughout the movie, as the intimacies of an unstable, but loving, relationship between two complicated people unravel. Allen, in what is often considered his breakthrough film, provides a witty and intelligent look into the irrationality of relationships, while offering humor as medicine to fight the bitterness that can sometimes accompany them. His intellectualization of the couple's time together does not divert attention from the emotions that are felt; the love, the anxiety, the frustration, the excitement, the laughter, and the tears. Diane Keaton's Oscar-winning performance as Annie Hall is truly remarkable. She is so sincere, revealing the insecurities and timidity that comes with trying to find love and acceptance without compromising who you are. Truly, Keaton is spectacular! All in all, I have to say that Annie Hall is every bit as touching and insightful as it is hilarious! Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I luff you, two ""f's""","I am, unapologetically so, a big fan of Woody Allen's work. Annie Hall, directed by Allen in 1977, was one of the great masterworks of his career. Starring Woody Allen, and Diane Keaton in the titular role, Annie Hall presents the lives of socially awkward, incredibly neurotic individuals, who are perfect only for each other, from the beginning to the end of their relationship. Woody Allen always injects a bit of himself in each film he has directed, Annie Hall, however, may be the most self-actualizing of Allen's films that audiences have ever seen. Idiosyncracies and nuances commonly known to be those of Allen's himself, give the audiences an insight into one of the most famed directors of our time.Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) has the only career he could possibly have, he is a comedian. Not that Alvy isn't intelligent, he is, or that he isn't capable of doing anything else, he would be, it's just that Alvy is an incredibly introspective and pensive individual who uses his own self-realizations to influence his comedy. At the beginning of the film, the audience learns that Alvy has broken up with the titular character and the succeeding film is his exploration of that relationship, in hopes to discover why it ended. Alvy is so stricken by the ending of his relationship with Annie because he truly believes that his 15+ years of psychological analysis has solved his problems which should have ensured his relationship with Annie would last. On the surface, the high-brow New Yorker Alvy, and the flighty Midwestern-born Annie would have no success in a union, yet, their peculiarities were such that they ended up being perfect for each other, or so it seemed. Perhaps it's his much discussed Jewish guilt or just his introspective nature, but Alvy just can't let go of his relationship with Annie Hall until he has come to a logical reason for why it ended.The introspective nature which Allen used as a vehicle for Annie Hall was brilliant and surely added to the host of reasons in which Annie Hall took Oscar's top prize for 1977. Annie Hall does something movies rarely get away with by breaking the 4th wall. Annie Hall breaks the wall so perfectly because the breaks add to the film, rather than take the audience away from the film. The technical aspects of this movie make it a dream to watch. The film is done almost exclusively using long takes, which are gutsy, but suited the conversational nature of Annie Hall to perfection. Another great technical attribute of mention is the title cards to input English on the ""foreign language"" scene on the roof. The script in which Allen penned in cooperation with Marshall Brickman was pure cinematic gold. One of my favorite scenes of all- time is contained within this film; the scene in which Alvy and Annie are in line at a movie theater and a guest behind them is loudly giving his sanctimonious opinion of the film in which they are about to see. Alvy is unable to hold his tongue any longer as the diatribe continues and he interrupts the gentleman to give his opinion, point out the flaws in his argument, and introduce him to the writer of the source material to further prove how wrong he was. This moment, though it happened only in Alvy's mind, was perfect, because who hasn't this happened to? Speaking of relatability, Alvy's character is one in which most everyone can relate to. Though probably not all of Alvy's mannerisms are present in one person at any given time, there are certainly many idiosyncracies one can identify in themselves that is present on screen in Allen's Alvy.As noted, I am a huge fan of Woody Allen's work. His ability to pull the worst parts of himself and humanity from his own being and put it on screen for others to realize they also possess are extraordinary. I can't think of any other modern director who nails the human aspects in their films like Allen can. Everything about Annie Hall works, even the parts that shouldn't. The split-screens, the breaking of the wall, the ""meeting the past"" it all works the way Allen puts it together. Has there ever been any criticism of this film? I'm sure there has been, I'm just not aware of it. It is for good reason Annie Hall won Best Picture, Best Director, a Best Actor nod for Allen, and Best Original Screenplay; and one doesn't even have to be a fan of Allen's work in order to appreciate his master work, Annie Hall.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Quintessential Woody Allen,"This is the quintessential Woody Allen film and defined a generation of people at the time it came out in 1977, many of his later films repeat the same ideas and themes of this one. Great romantic comedy, possibly THE romantic comedy of romantic comedies. The film centers around Allen in his typical nebbishy character, and his romantic involvement with Diane Keaton. Very funny, great 1970's feel, really captures the mood of Manhattan at the time, a time capsule which feels slightly dated but in a fantastic nostalgic way, not in a outdated campy way. Sums ups Allens theory about life pretty well, people in New York don't have to worry about much so they create their own neuroses.

My favorite is when Woody discovers a bar of black soap in the bathroom and says to Annie, ""What are you, joining a minstrel show?""  That line had me laughing for about 5 minutes straight!  I'm not going to be a snob and say I don't like low-brow sexual humor, but it's always good to see a film that doesn't rely highly on it--and ""Annie Hall"" is one of those films.  Even the jokes that contain sexual references are done tastefully and intelligently, like when the couple are trying to make love, but she finds the sound of airplanes flying by distracting.  Woody rants, ""What are we supposed to do?  Tell 'em they can't fly any more planes so we can make love?""  In other words, the jokes and gags in this movie don't insult your intelligence.  A person with an I.Q. of 30 would have a problem finding the humor in this movie.  The meandering plot structure, if you can call it that, gets a bit jarring at times.  However, there's enough entertaining moments in the movie to make it worth seeing, especially if you're a Woody Allen fan.  Some people don't get him, but I'm a neurotic myself, so his humor doesn't fly over my head.My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the ten great film comedies,"People either love or hate Woody Allen, but there are few people who do not love this beautiful film.  When it appeared in 1977, this free-wheeling, bittersweet examination of relationships in the latter half of this century was the funniest film since 1959 (Some Like it Hot), and it has remained the only serious film which has managed to be as funny as the brightest nonsense comedies -- Bringing Up Baby, His Girl Friday, Way Out West, To Be or Not to Be, The Lady Eve, Duck Soup. Allen never before or after managed to strike such a perfect balance between the serious and the outrageously comic: the marvelous Manhattan (1979) and Hannah and Her Sisters (1986) are not nearly as hilarious, nor are meant to be.  A real gem among gems, and not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Brilliantly inventive comedy,"Like many peak directorial achievements, Annie Hall was made at an artistic crossroads. It was the point where Woody Allen was coming to the end of his 'funny' period and beginning his comedy-drama one. This movie, is so good because it is a glorious amalgamation of those two strands. While on one hand its a movie that has realistic characters and acute observations about male-female relationships, it also still incorporates much of the visual and narrative invention of his earlier 'funnies'. Its essentially a hybrid film in this respect. Its central drama is played relatively straight but it is enlivened considerably by a fragmented non-linear narrative replete with flash-backs and absurdist moments. Allen often addresses the audience directly and even wheels on Marshall McLuhan in one inspired moment. The style includes standard romantic comedy, slapstick, surrealism and even an animated segment. Characters from past and present speak to each other, split-screen is used to compare and contrast, while subtitles reveal the underlying meanings in the double-talk that men and women subject each other to. Annie Hall is post-modern in a way that always seems to benefit the material. Its an experiment that doesn't break the test tube.The story-line itself is very simple really with little in the way of major plot developments. Like many great films though the interest lies in the detail that is extracted from this straightforward template. The central narrative is basically about a relationship between a comic Alvy Singer and a part-time cabaret artist Annie Hall. In combining the humour with the autobiographical, Allen's film is by turns hilarious and insightful. And this aligned with the cinematic inventiveness is what makes it a masterpiece. Its not just a romantic comedy of course but a rumination on other Allen concerns such as New York vs. California and his views on contemporary culture. What makes this all so good is that he never gives out simple biased answers to any of this. For example, despite having a number of hilarious digs at California's expense, he has Annie head off to find happiness there anyway; while the central relationship doesn't have a happy ending, although valuable lessons are derived from it. Of course the reason that all of this works on screen so well is due to the performances of everybody involved but special credit has to go to Allen and Diane Keaton who both excel here. They have the requisite chemistry as well as beautiful comic interplay. While it almost goes without saying that the writing is top drawer; equally funny and intelligent, usually both at the same time. Allen has never produced anything better than this.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen is soooo overrated!,"This film is probably one of the worst if not the worst films to take home an Oscar. Woody Allen has made a career out of wiping his ""ego"" on celluloid and calling it a feature movie. It's funny how in every film of Woody Allen's, he portrays the women in it as these stupid, ditsy, uninformed containers, while he is always the all-knowing, critical, sharp-remarking, neurotic genius who has been put there to enlighten these women on the world. Of course, the relationship fails in this film, as it reflects his personal life and taste in women...Annie Hall must have been too old for his liking or possessed too much of a will or a brain. What you do get in a Woody Allen film such as this, is two hours of his crappy, shallow, dishonest diatribe that conceals the creep inside of the ego. Annie Hall feels more like a fake, constructed front for a movie rather than delving into real emotional territory, but then, we are talking about Woody Allen.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Heady and Genuine, a Potent Dash of Relational Reality","Woody Allen at his best: baring his insecurities and shortcomings, muttering and mumbling his way through a string of sharp, witty statements, experimenting with film techniques, admiring the lost landscape of 1970s New York and, still, finding time for a rich, colorful portrayal of a years-long romance. Allen and Diane Keaton really make the film work, their rapport is so smooth, easy and genuine. We want to see them tough it out together, because their good times are so pure and true, but we know that fresh infatuation has a relatively short shelf life and the characters' essential differences make a longer, more serious relationship impossible. We see it all in a string of short snapshots, an expert mix of vital moments that anyone who's been through such a whirlwind will no doubt recognize. Those early, sunny memories you won't forget and the later, stormier ones you can't. Funny and poignant, with a dash of playful fourth-wall recognizance to keep us on our toes, it expertly churns all sorts of universal emotions.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Write about what you know""","""Write about what you know"", or so they say. In ""Annie Hall"", one of Woody Allen's first films, we can sense the application of that common phrase. Allen and Marshall Brickman wrote the script of the movie, but we can never imagine Brickman's collaboration or influence. I say this meaning no disrespect, but Woody is the man we've always seen; the beautiful neurotic we've learned to love and recognize in many characters he never even played (Mia Farrow's character in ""The Purple Rose of Cairo"" or Jason Biggs' in ""Anything Else"", to put to examples distant in time). And that man is the same Alvy Singer, the protagonist of this movie, to whom Allison (Carol Kane) says: ""You're cute"".And how can he not be? A comedian who divides life between the miserable and the horrible, Alvy looks at the camera and talks to us, wondering why Annie (Diane Keaton) left him; trying to understand what he did wrong. So he takes us through their relationship, and we learn that once he tells Annie about his division of life: ""You should be happy that you're miserable"". We learn about Annie and about him, but mostly about him, and we instantly understand what went wrong. There are a million ways to look at it, but Alvy, an irreparable egocentric, passed his depressive view of life to Annie: he bought her books about death, told her to visit an analyst, shut down her social life little by little.But that's not the point, because Alvy we'll never admit it, and he'll never understand. His prejudiced view of everything, his need to always teach the rest something and the thought that he knows better will never change. He tries hard to show us his childhood, which he revisits once in a while as if he was daydreaming-by himself, with Annie or with his best friend Rob (Tony Roberts)-, his previous relationships and a mix of what he did as a comedian in the past and what he does now. In a monstrous editing work by Wendy Greene Bricmont and Ralph Rosenblum, we share Alvy's disappointment in life. He looks at the camera in the middle of conversations so he can analyze a situation, and stops people in the middle of the street to look for solutions.As I already said, it's in vain; and maybe Alvy's relationship with Annie was doomed from the beginning. We also get a look at Annie's previous relationships and we can understand what drove her to a man like Alvy (yes, he's a man in his forties, who tells us about being in the middle of a life crisis as he looks for explanations to what occurred to him). So if everything was lost, what is it there to find? Well, contradictorily, everything.I'll tell you...The first encounter they both share, which involves a whole afternoon, is a lesson of cinema; of character creation and writing in a genre that exists no more. The romantic comedy we watch today and that I love is so different from this fantastic piece that shares its genre definition, that if you walked today into ""Annie Hall"" and they told you what kind of movie it is, you'd come out of the theater saying you've been fooled.The psychological reflections, the moments of quiet observation, the scary plausibility of the performances and the risk of making something so seemingly autobiographical (that makes you hate and love a character/human being in different moments of the ride) and re- declaring it again inside of it make ""Annie Hall"" the masterpiece it is. And it's also a masterpiece because it's the essence of a cinema that has disappeared or is at least in extinction, and that Woody Allen tried to keep alive.Never taking the easy way out, always in the search of an unpredictable surprise, the writer/director bet on characters, writing about what he knew, knowing that, that way, he could never go wrong. And he never did.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant Wrtting and Amazing Acting Carries This Delightfull Movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Annie Hall"" (1977) is a brilliantly acted and written romance / comedy / drama.

Definitely Not Ostentacious To Call It The Best,"Woody Allen's odd structuring of his first serious comedy-- subtitles, animation, fourth-wall devesation, proved that even at his most traditional, the heart of a neurotic rebel still shines through.Many have called this the seminal romantic comedy of the 100+ year history of movies.  Blending old and new archetypes, it insists on never exhibiting a dull moment in the relationship of Alvy and Annie, always leaning towards quirky sequences and Vaudeville-like setups to deliver the entertainment over traditional plot arcs.  The fact that ""Annie Hall"" used an original framing device of a murder mystery allows the movie to get away with a great deal.  Plus, it helps that it beat out ""Star Wars"" to win Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay at the Academy Awards in 1977.  If you're reading these comments as a means of recommendation, please do know that from a very conservative filmgoer's POV, ""Annie Hall"" is the real thing:  it won't waste your time.  It's funny, touching, heartfelt, and wonderfully executed.

Nice Woody Allen...,"""Annie Hall"" is a movie in which we have a strange and neurotic comedian who fells in love with Annie Hall. We watch their relationship as the time passes and we observe their personalities how change also as the time passes.I liked this movie because of the plot and the beautiful direction which made by Woody Allen. His interpretation in this movie as the comedian Alvy Singer was also great but I have to admit that the interpretation that I like most was Diane Keaton's who played as Annie Hall. One more thing that I liked in this movie was that it shows us the difference between people personalities and how this can change when they are in a relationship. It shows us also which has to be the priorities of a person and that is depending on who that person is and what he or she wants for hi or her life.Finally I believe that ""Annie Hall"" is one of the best Woody Allen's movies because is not shows us only the above things that I mentioned but also the most important, ambition for life and evolution as a person. I really liked this movie and I strongly recommend it to everyone, I believe that is a must see movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Very Interesting and Very Good Film!!!,"Annie Hall is a very interesting and very funny movie by Woody Allen. He uses a variety of techniques to tell the story. He uses animation, subtitles, cross-overs, flash backs and also talks to us (the audience). It is a huge accomplishment in film-making and writing. It offers insight to death, religion, sexuality, drugs, relationships, families, sex, college courses and even lobsters and bugs. In my opinion, this movie started the now very common romantic-comedies.Annie Hall follows Alvy Singer (Woody Allen), a neurotic, over-sexed comedian, and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), a ditsy nightclub singer (who is a terrible driver). They first meet at a tennis match set up by friend Rob (Tony Roberts). In no chronological order, we follow the ups and downs of their relationship.This critically acclaimed Best Picture winner is a very odd movie. Having been the first Woody Allen movie I've seen I can already tell he is an extremely influential filmmaker. His style reminds me strangely of Quentin Tarantino's style.He uses animation, subtitles (which tells us what they are thinking, instead of saying (a very funny scene, mind you)), cross overs, flash backs and he even talks to us. Asking us our opinion, making us feel like we are really there, watching their relationship unfold. Keaton and Allen have great chemistry on-screen, which makes this so much more enjoyable.Alvy's views are very interesting, and sometimes very true. This movie is extremely funny, granted, it's not side-splitting. It's more subtle, but it is very effective.This may not be everyone's type of movie, but it is a huge accomplishment in writing, directing and acting. And not surprisingly, this movie won Best Picture, Best Director, Best Screenplay and Best Actress (Diane Keaton).5/5.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Utter tripe,"I trust that modern viewers will see this film for what it is; an exercise in narcissistic self obsession that gives the viewer nothing to appreciate but a glimpse into the world of a 70's icon grossly obsessed with his own self-image and self imposed sense of grandeur.If you enjoy modern day indie circle jerking then you may appreciate this mind numbing marathon of boredom.The screenplay consists of an endless loop of Allen's 'intellectual' bickering about modern living that has absolutely no pacing or narrative development, never mind its wafer thin intellectual depth and pseudo-psychology. Poor acting by both of the only two characters in this film make for a study of how to fail in engaging the audience.Watch this film to learn why the Oscars have no credibility.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent movie,"This movie is thirty years old but stands the test of time, meaning that after all these years the movie is still watchable. Now why is is still watchable? Because it deals with the nature of relationships, a topic which transcends time. Also, the acting is wonderful, especially Diane Keaton's performance as Annie. Diane Keaton has to be one of the best comediennes Hollywood has ever produced, and Woody Allen goes the extra mile to show the audience the fundamental absurdity and irrationality of romantic involvements. Far from being some corny, superficial farce, this movie presents an interesting character study of a woman who undergoes emotional and intellectual growth while her partner struggles, unsuccessfully, to cope with the change. If you want to watch a movie about someone who changes for the better, then this is the movie for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A CLASSIC, defiantly a 9/10","I think Annie Hall is the best Romance / Comedy movie that I have ever seen in my whole life, an amazing and a classic movie that I really enjoyed.First of all, before anything lets just talk about Annie Hall as the movie that was released in 1977, that's an important note that everyone should know because if we are going to compare it to other ""Romance / Comedy"" movies that were released after it then that's a whole different issue.Annie Hall is a movie that I was surprised that I liked it and gave it a 9/10, the movie is just full of talking and conversations, nothing really exciting happens (if you are not into these movies then this movie is definitely not for you and you'll really get bored), but when there is a movie that's like that and it grabs your attention by the little stuff and details that it has, that's when you know that you are watching a great movie.The first 20 or 30 minutes of the movie was boring a little bit and felt like there the story isn't being told well, but as I started to watch more and more of it, that's when I started to really enjoy the movie and wanted to know more about their relationship life and their daily life in general.
Really really loved how in one of the scenes it's literarily written what they were thinking about inside their heads, and the movie shows us that in many different ways and that's what I loved about the movie. So many movies nowadays show us what a character is thinking inside their head and it's not a new thing, but in 1977 I think it was a new thing.The directing was absolutely incredible, Woody Allen did a fantastic job and really deserved an Oscar for that. The screenplay was really well written and I mention how I loved how the story was told to the audience. The customs were so very fantastic, cool and simple and did really fit the characters so well and with the environment around them, and yes I'm talking about Annie Hall's (Played by Diane Keaton) customs in the whole movie but the one that really grabbed my attention and everyone's I think, was the one with the weird tie.Diane Keaton was amazing in that movie and really deserved that Oscar for best actress in a leading role, her awkwardness, her acting and everything in her was just amazing in that movie, amazing performance hats off to her, Woody Allen was also amazing and did a great job of making us laugh the whole movie, I mean the whole movie, in general, is funny and it has some jokes that were funny, it did a great job in that part in particular.Annie Hall is a great and a classic that is not for everyone unfortunately and I'm sure many people will say that it's overrated or it's boring and I get it why they say that but for me the movie was amazing and I enjoyed every scene in it, definitely deserved an Oscar for best picture.My rating is: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Annie and Alvy are a little more extreme than most of us, but the situations they face are all too real.

Woody Allen At His Hilarious Best,"""Annie Hall"" deserves to be Woody Allen's best remembered film. It is a shining example of comic brillance. When it coes to writing, directing and starring in light comedies about middle aged and neurotic New Yorkers facing midlife crises and desperately trying to make sense of it all, nobody does it better than Allen. This 1977 United Artists release won a well deserved Academy Award for Best Picture while costar Diane Keaton was voted Best Actress and Allen was voted Best Director. Several future stars including Jeff Goldblum and Beverly D'Angelo make early and noticable film bit appearances here. A highly recommended character study comedy even if you are not especially a fan of Allen's work. This one ranks high above all of his other films.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Focussed and funny, Allen's ""Hall"" is a winner.","Thank heavens I know about enough of people like William Buckley and Marshall McLuhan in order to enjoy ""Annie Hall""; thank goodness I know who Federico Fellini is in order to laugh at one of its jokes whereby his name is mentioned. ""Annie Hall"" is like that - it's in and out with a joke or a reference or a line of dialogue and, before you've even been granted the time to absorb it; digest it; appreciate it, it's flown on to the next one. It plays, in fact, a little bit like a stand-up comedy routine - it has a certain flowing evanescence to it, an absorbing self-confidence. It isn't flippant or chaotic - moreover, it is a film under almost the complete control of those who have made it; its poise refreshing and its influence on its genre coming to it now quite evident.""Annie Hall"" is, in essence, a somewhat conventional love story told in an unconventional, even peculiar, manner. It breaks the fourth wall; hops around two different equilibriums; plucks famous people out from behind house plants and speaks to them; interviews people in the street; uproots the action from one end of the United States to the other halfway through and, perhaps most jarringly, departs for an animated sequence involving the film's protagonist and an old Disney villain. And yet, at its heart, is a relatively simple exploration of love; relationships and what it means to really feel something for someone else.Alvy, played by the film's director and writer Woody Allen, is a stand-up comedian living in New York with a kind of C-list celebrity status whose life is characterised by his comedic routines; games of tennis with his best friend Rob (Tony Roberts) and a persecution complex that all Gentiles secretly hate him (he mishears when someone asks him 'Did you...?' and 'Did Jew...?') He has already been married twice.His story is one about a relationship with the eponymous Annie, played by Diane Keaton, who, just to complicate a film already dripping in postmodernism, happened to be Allen's partner at the time of the shoot; whose surname was originally Hall and whose real-life nickname was, indeed, 'Annie'. It cannot be a coincidence that, when they are first introduced to one another at a tennis club, they quite literally undertake this process of facing off over the net with one another, going head-to-head in what is a sport characterised by back-and-forths. Later, when they head back to hers for a drink and she serves wine, one of them must consume theirs out of a half-pint glass due to a lack of proper wine-glasses. It's a small detail but it cleverly infers Annie is not used to hosting.The pleasure, in fact, from watching the film derives from the fact the subject matter is handled with a surprising amount of maturity, which clashes with the approach but never sees one overwhelm the other. It also derives from the fact the film, exemplified in the above, is made like a proper film: the camera is an active participant in the action and the message; the edits are rarely invisible; the approaches it takes to shooting specific scenes appear carefully chosen for specific reasons.Take, for instance, the scene fairly early on, though deep into Alvy and Annie's tryst, whereby, in the dead of night, they lie in bed and talk over one another, unsure if they want to make love, and are shot from a perspective which is so far away, we are able to see the entire room and all its clutter. Eventually, a siren roars past outside and they call the whole thing off. The language of the scene infers degrees of chaos and mess in their relationship, a sharp contrast to an earlier scene under exactly the same circumstances when they are shot from a tighter angle, reflecting closeness, and in tones more synonymous with scenes of romance - low lighting and soft shadow.But the film is more than a mere love story, the likes of which we may have seen a hundred times. It philosophises on relationships; concluding that while some are just doomed, irrespective of what is tried, you need them in the first place in order to move on to life's next stage. Alvy, for instance, encourages Annie to study an adult course in something, but this only pushes her closer to a lecturer. When he tells her to take her singing more seriously, this just pushes her into the eyes of a record producer, thus dooming the relationship. And yet, what would Annie really be if she'd never even met Alvy?Dorling Kindersley's ""Movie Book"" of 2014 concludes that the film is, at its heart, an exploration of what makes a relationship successful, even resorting to asking people in a New York street what they think. But, the review concludes bleakly, there is no real answer: one couple remark that they're happy because they're shallow and don't have 'anything interesting to say' to one another. Compared to modern comedies about sex or relations or a combination of the two, this stands head and shoulders above most in the genre and is unsurprisingly looked upon as the springboard for Allen's fame.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Inexhaustibly funny and bittersweet,"I don't know anymore how many times I've watched ""Annie Hall,"" and I'd still be happy to see it again any time.  The dialogue is so eminently quotable, so sharp and snappy and hysterically funny, that you almost don't feel it reaching somewhere deeper at first, but pretty soon you might notice a tear or two rolling down your cheeks that's not just from laughing so hard. Unquestionably Allen's masterpiece, it does such a great job of capturing the awkwardness, humor, pathos, insanity, futility, and hopeless beauty of romantic relationships that it's almost the only film you need to see on the subject.  There are so many classic scenes in this film that I've almost begun to imagine ""Annie Hall"" was really two or three movies--all of those great bits couldn't really be from the same film, could they?  The opening and closing monologues are great examples of and tributes to a great and very old tradition of Jewish humor, and they set just the right tone for this wonderfully sad and hilarious story.

Amazing.,"Although the innovative style in which he told his story was not new- the flashbacks, walking into his past etc was all done twenty years earlier in Wild Strawberries- the film feels as though it's reinventing cinema in a simple and direct way.The plot is basically boy gets girl, boy loses girl, etc. But the way Woody Allen tells this story, and the casting and chemistry that he concocted is just stellar. It's clear that Allen and Keaton are or were in love with each other, and they pop right off the screen. Every other role, from Colleen Dewhurst to Christopher Walken, is perfectly cast.But the story itself, the simple way he deals with finding love, then losing it, will touch you. I don't think of this film so much as a comedy, although it's absolutely hilarious, as a film about loss with some laughs, and I appreciate it enough to watch it every few years, like an old friend.If you've never seen this film, you're in for a wonderful evening.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Annie Hall Review,"Almost immediately, you can tell that there is something different about this film. Woody Allen talks directly to the camera multiple times which is pretty uncommon in films. He seems to almost narrate, however he is shown talking instead of an omniscient voice talking over different scenes. This direct connection to the viewer is a significant point in this film. I enjoyed the variety of settings in this film. While most of the story took place in New York City, Annie and Alvie were also seen at the beach and in California. There is also a beautiful shot of the Brooklyn Bridge shown as Annie and Alvie walk through the city. I enjoyed this film due to the acting style of Woody Allen. Before this film, I had never seen a work done by Woody Allen. His awkward humor really makes this movie great.

When Woody Allen became great.,"""Annie Hall"" (1977): Simply one of the most innovative, interesting, insightful films you will ever experience - again and again. THIS work announced that Woody Allen would never again return to slapstick comedy, and would instead draw from deeply personal sources in the manner of other serious artists. It's innovative for his use of still camera shots that allow it's characters to leave (or never enter) a scene (yet you hear their conversation), subtitling of thoughts vs words, movies within movies, the use of animation within a ""normal"" film, giving the dialog to other actors on a stage, characters who leave their bodies and still carry on conversations, characters who break from the film and talk to us the audience, split screen depictions of different times or places with the characters speaking to one another across the splits, flash backs of characters that describe their futures...it's a superb break from what was expected. It's interesting on more than artistic levels, as Allen delves into references far beyond the mundane, and presents them with wit, humor, and awkward honesty. It's insightful for his honest and thoughtful look at how humans behave under different realities. ""Annie Hall"" is a masterpiece. (And watch for many lucky young actors (such as Jeff Goldblume, Christopher Walken, Shelley Duval, etc.) who, thirty years ago, could only dream that ""Annie Hall"" would help kick start their hopeful careers.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Annie Hall,"Woody Allen and Diane Keaton play themselves and get the Academy Award for best picture. The setting is Woody's beloved Manhattan. There is memorable dialogue.

new fan,"iv never seen a woody Allen film besides antz (which is a really great movie) even though its animated woody Allen's character still has a lot of his traits, smart and very sarcastic, also extremely witty and sort of shy. but this film was really great for the first time of me seeing it. the whole time in my head I watched this film I mistook woody Allen for woody Harrison boy was I way off. for some reason all his characters in his movie are always connected with sex, was this guy a sex maniac in his younger years or is this something that has always been in his background? And woody Allen is not the most attractive guy (no offense) but what made him want to go that angle, I just the 60s and 70s everyone was a sex addict.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Annie Hall is a comedy for ever,"Annie hall is still fresh after years. it started a new form of comedy ,a nervous,absurd and romantic comedy.look at the style Allen and Keaton talk to each other or look at the monologues of Allen how nervous and absurd are. but how comic Allen showed these bitter facts.in fact this is the power of woody Allen that can make a situation bitter ,philosophic and comic.I said it is fresh because it is simultaneously make you laugh and think and full of deep jokes that are metaphors of reality.Allen forms his jokes precisely and mix it beautifully with the main story.the screenplay is nicely done,there are full of back and forth in the time of the film but it does not mix you up and you can easily chase the main line of the story.it is not a easy work to organize a screenplay like this full of sub-stories that woody Allen could deal with it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
best of the best,"Annie Hall is my favorite Woody Allen film. There is humor and meaning in almost every scene. Not a line or word muttered is wasted. And a majority of the lines are memorable and quotable. The editing is beautifully done, and the whole film seems to be made up of long takes. Long takes as opposed to short ones that made up a lot of movies in the past, make it more enjoyable and smoother to watch. Also, Allen's approach of breaking the fourth wall is done in a way different than most films that do this. It definitely kept my attention and made the film even more entertaining than it already was. Annie Hall is definitely one of the best romantic comedies I have ever seen. It beats modern rom-coms by a landslide.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Disgusting, boring monument to selfish and neurotic romance","I realize I'm taking on an icon here, but honestly, this is the most disgustingly boring and over-rated film to come out of the 1970's. It is unfortunate that the rather pathetic Woody Allen, an admittedly intelligent man who alas squanders his considerable talents, firmly believes that the cosmos revolves around his legendary neuroses. Even more unfortunate, is the fact that he has succeeded in persuading a large percentage of the Western world to agree with him. Frankly, it does not speak well of our culture.This (yawn) movie revolves around a pair of self absorbed lovers...a neurotic New York comedian, Alvy Singer (played by Woody) and a would-be singer, Annie Hall. The two, both in analysis, move in together so they can exchange tales of their professional, paid for navel gazing. I certainly wouldn't want to imply that it might be simply for the convenient sex. The rest of this so called neurotic romance is far too inconsequential to bother detailing here.Annie Hall is played by Diane Keaton, an actress who is actually very competent. Her movies are frequently not my favorite, though I did enjoy the cute Baby Boom. Her only memorable aspect in this film is her Ralph Lauren clothes, now of course quite dated, which supposedly caused a fashion revolution at the time.That classic comment of Woody's regarding sex, ""This is the most fun I've had without laughing"" doesn't particularly impress me with its brilliance. Fear not, Shakespeare, Woody serves as no threat to you as master of the English language. It is indeed sad that so many people seem to praise this mindless, uninspiring, unoriginal, and not even particularly amusing pearl of wisdom as though it had virtually descended from the gods on Mount Olympus.Annie Hall isn't the absolute worst movie I've ever seen, but it really doesn't have much to recommend it. I normally adore romances, but neither one of these two selfish neurotics captured my sympathy or even remote interest. Furthermore, the supposed witty banter between the pair failed woefully to either entertain or amuse me. Back in 1977 when I saw this movie at the theatre with my husband (then boyfriend), we both sincerely wished we'd found some paint and watched it dry instead. I guess this intellectual comedy was just far too complicated for little old us to appreciate.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful film,"Somehow, I just saw this film for the first time the other night. My excuse is that I was born in 1982 and it takes a really long time to see every 'classic' that was made up to that point, especially when I'm barely able to keep up with the ones made in my lifetime. Anyhow, this was an incredibly creative film in many ways: Allen jumps into asides unexpectedly, at one point even dragging other characters into them; the story is told in seemingly random sequence; the characters are complex and every scene serves to develop them (as opposed the Hollywood's usual 5 minute 'crash course' in its characters). Allen takes small jabs at the L.A. lifestyle, which are frequently hilarious (there's no litter because they turn all their trash into TV shows... awesome!), and gives love to sweet, sweet NYC.As far as the comedy goes, this is one funny movie! I laughed very frequently (a euphoric, free kind of laugh, as opposed to the guilty, cringing kind of laugh that most modern comedy induces). While it may not be fall-out-of-your chair funny, it's sly, wise, original, stylistically varied humor, which is always refreshing.Watching this made me realize how much it must have influenced the makers of some of my favorite films about relationships (""High Fidelity"", ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind""), and also how much I apparently love this sub genre of melancholy comedies (Shall we call them 'melanomedies'?). Indeed, ""Annie Hall"" is a melancholy film, as it focuses on the full spectrum of a romantic relationship. That spectrum involves a few wonderful highs, but unbearable pain as well. The overall feel of the film as well as its final voice-over keep it from being depressive in any sense, but this is certainly not a feel-good movie. This is a film that dares to venture outside of the very unreal world in which most movie characters seem to reside and into the world that makes up the hearts and minds of most average individuals For that, this movie fan is incredibly grateful.The only criticism of this film I have (and it's a small knit-pick, mind you) is that it occasionally tends to meander totally off-track from anything relating to its overall story and purpose, as if Woody had a list of funny sketches lying around that he promised himself he'd slip into his next film one way or another. It works out okay, because the film is always entertaining and his transitions are smooth, but there are a few parts that really seem unnecessary in a film that's otherwise so thematically focused.Whatever, this is still a wonderful little film with extraordinary acting from its two leads and writing more clever than 99.9% of all other films made, ever. Bravo! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
One to watch again and again,"This film was perhaps Woody Allen at his greatest, and so can be appreciated even if you are not, or never thought you were, a fan of his work. I think it is a near-perfect mixture of comedy, angst and observation, all done by superb acting and taut direction and screenplay. Allen and Keaton's relationship develops in a way that most of us could relate to, and while it doesn't have a traditional Hollywood ending, it still leaves me with that time-honoured 'feel good factor'. Treat yourself to it...you never know.",,Anonymous,Romance
"A witty, unique masterpiece.","One of the most original films I've ever seen. Woody Allen uses a bounty of different techniques in the film to the point where it almost feels experimental, but he doesn't base the film around these techniques. He breaks the fourth dimension (in a very High Fidelity fashion), has the characters walking around in their own flashbacks, has subtitles detailing the characters' thoughts and fragments the story but he never overdoes any of the techniques. He makes them all feel natural and doesn't use anything for the entire film. In doing this it all feels very fresh and vibrant and moves at a quick pace. It's ninety minute running time was also quite nice with so many films running well over two hours these days. Allen integrates these techniques into a very relatable story of the relationship between the neurotic, self-destructive Alvy Singer (Allen) and the beautiful, intelligent aspiring singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). I found Alvy's nervousness and cynicism to be very relatable to my own personality and that really helped me to connect with this character and feel his emotions as the film progressed. Of course the fact that it was absolutely witty and hilarious really helped my love for it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"La-Di-Da, La-Di-Da, La La","Annie invites Alvy up to her apartment for the first time. They have a drink and chat. Subtitles tell us what each person's thinking throughout. We see that what they're saying is not what they're thinking. More particularly, because they're essentially preoccupied with impressing each other and forming a new relationship, we see a dialogue wherein they're both too engrossed in assessing their own performance to totally partake. They censure what they're saying as they're saying it, and accordingly, their actual interaction becomes practically hollow. What makes this scene hilarious is the incongruity between what both people are saying and what they're thinking. Normally, we don't get such an advantaged spy-hole on a conversation. And watching this scene, we become conscious that these discrepancies between thought and speech surface along with the prospect of romance. The deeper connotation's that romantic relationships are somehow very different from friendly ones, that romantic ones characteristically involve deception on some level.Alvy ruminates on his elementary school days, where there's an off-the-wall incorporation of the present with the past. We hear him narrate about his class as we watch the action. At some point though, the adult Alvy steps into the scene, intermingles with the children and teacher of his past, who then act like they're living in the present along with him. The wittiness here's rooted in the peculiar temporal absurdities regarding him and his classmates, who are hilariously children and adults simultaneously. And it nurtures vital issues about the connection between our childhood and adult actions, between genetics and culture in shaping behavior. When we hear the kids talking about what they've become as grown-ups, we instantly start to laugh in wonder at how they got from this to that. How do innocent seven-year-old children, with like cultural backgrounds, grow up to be so different from each other? What inborn temperaments and fusion of occurrences in their lives led to such wide-ranging identities? Allen proposes no answers for these questions, but he undoubtedly instills these uncertainties. They encompass the background feel for the rest of the film. To be sure, one of the key ideas of Annie Hall is our powerlessness to ever get a thorough grasp of how and why people change. Periodically, we're offered self-spoofing philosophical masturbation about this multifaceted subject, but never are we given an ultimate resolution of it. The insinuation's that we may never have a complete one.Like Seinfeld, Annie Hall taps reflexive humor from everyday occasions: quarrelling about whether it's tolerable to enter a movie after it's begun; withstanding tedious cocktail parties. I can conceive of George relating to Alvy's slant on romance: He doesn't want a woman who'd want him. And mightn't Kramer have been disheartened as a kid over the expansion of the universe? Why does dialogue always seem more real in Woody Allen films? Because he doesn't begin conversations with someone arriving, end with them leaving, transposing trite formula onto an otherwise good story. Instead, it works to conceive variations, opening scenes in the middle of things, ending dialogues without prolonging them, without people straining to bring things to a finish. He keeps characters' words from delineating the sense of opening and closure. As well, many comedians kill jokes by giving too much or little information that gives us our grasp, or by either hastening or prolonging the pace of the information delivery. Consciously setting us up to laugh needs a sharp familiarity with a scenario, including delicate particulars about the vibes and expectations of an audience, then making them abruptly conscious of an unanticipated change, such that some initial notions about the situation are spontaneously changed.Slimly built, anxious, rambling, bespectacled, wildly gesturing, highly strung, and a ceaseless wit, Woody as an actor is both familiar and personal, and with her ditzy proclivity for men's clothing, WASPy background and airy exhortations, fish-in-the-Manhattan-sea Annie is the spot-on counterpoint to Alvy's Jewish NYC valetudinarian. Though she's remembered more for her fickle naivete, it's Annie's obscurely morose tendencies---she requires pot to take pleasure in sex, her analyst proposes five sessions a week---that gives her profundity. And what gets us stuck on her is the breezy sweetness, idiosyncratic beauty and natural comic timing of Keaton herself. Whether she's playing herself or a variation on herself or what Woody envisioned, it's all her. Even that iconic look. And yet the word I believe best describes her performance is effortless. She simply doesn't hide her reactions, doesn't seem to have a fixed Method-style concentration on character, motivation. She's just herself in 1977.Allen uses broad comedy, breaking the fourth wall and even a cartoon sequence to break comic distance and allow us to see from Alvy's point-of-view. It's an unassumingly compelling vehicle for imparting philosophically valuable ideas, highlighting unanticipated incongruities in each scene, using them to reap fresh thematic understanding. Joking's not subject to the same criticism as other exchange of ideas, and this makes it viable to persuade the audience to consider thoughtful subjects generally not dealt with. In so many scenes, nearly every one, Allen draws on absurdist humor straightforwardly to broach fascinating theoretical doubts, and gets the audience to contemplate them. Indeed, it's repeatedly the case that the raising of such questions is a central part of the film's subject matter.Creating a stream-of-consciousness narrative, Allen uses an intellectual style of editing, but also a buildup of cutting based on the mind's distortion of time, multifaceted visual arrangements and stage-managed chronological length of shots to fuse the film's effect on us for a more concentrated, conceptual effect than eliciting our most straightforward, reactive sleepwalk through a standard formula. At the end, we're left with more questions about subjects like love than we had at the start of the film. It looks to be Allen's aim to point up that there are no simple answers to particular crucial questions about life, to cultivate our understanding of the complexities involved in grasping such complicated matters.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not sure how I feel about the ""film"", but the way it was filmed was something else. A fantastic breath of fresh air","Ahh, the feeling one gets while watching this Woody Allen Classic. He completely breaks the rules of ""Hollywood Invisibility"", and at pretty much every time he gets (Allen is also a main actor in this film) the chance to, he steps out of the film world to interact with us. It's almost as if we were standing in the room, and whenever something that would garner a reaction out of us, Allen reaches out and addresses it, directly with us. He also breaks the rules of a typical flashback very early on in the film, and personally, I think it's one of the best scenes I've seen in a long time, let alone this film. The way Allen handles the chronology, the realism (lack thereof), and acting is what makes this film so great. Which brings me to the next part, the acting. While viewing this film, I didn't feel as though I was watching actors perform roles on a screen. I couldn't say, ""The way Diane Keaton played Annie was really great, I think if they cast actress X though it may have been a bit better"". And I don't feel anyone could logically, thoughtfully make that assumption. Because the film focused on what was real, what was raw. None of the actors ""fit"" into any particular role, they all had their quirks, obsessions that in film, can either be a core focus of the film or play towards the film's underlying meaning. In Annie Hall, not so much. They were just people. And their person-hood wasn't to some greater goal. I feel like Allen couldn't have directed this film any better even if he tried.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Funny film,"The final result is something deep yet funny; to the extent that it could be the funniest psychological movie ever made. I loved that collection of daily details which formulate the lead's character eloquently, take a list: How he, as self-conceited, feels importunate necessity to prove his point of view's rightness for some guy, who hears accidentally in a line of a theater; hence, it takes a brief dream appearance of (Marshall McLuhan) to assure the lead's superiority, and shut-up any disagreement. The lead's culture gets in the way between him and having sex with a beauty, while - in fact - it's his forever fear disguised as a discussion about who killed (JFK), where he doesn't suspect the CIA, but - really - his own sexual capacities! The lead doesn't see anyone further himself; so he deemed dully that the need for love, ambition, encouragement, and alteration form his girl's side--are nothing but bad symptoms caused by her period! He was too blind to grasp the truth of himself as the actual reason of why his love failed. And lastly, he can't change himself, only his love story's end, which he writes as a play; because what can't be fixed in reality can be fixed in art. This is, as a whole, a profound exploration done very amusingly too.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Annie Hall,I love Woody Allen and his awkward humor. The opening scene is very fascinating and I love how he breaks the fourth wall. This is just a really cool technique. He just sits and talks to the audience in an almost rambling. This allows him to establish a relationship with audience. He really just seems like a regular guy who is talking about his problems and his distress. The rambling just makes it authentic its easy to connect. I also enjoy the use of flashbacks. The scene when he is a kid who has already given up is funny. He has like adult depressions as a child. This was a great movie to see since I love stand up comedy and I have never seen a woody Allen movie so this was a good experience.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I had heard so much praise for it by so many credible folks, but failed to be impressed once I got around to seeing it.Maybe it's just because I'm a young midwestern boy, so different from Woody, that I can't connect with it.

One of the funniest movies I've ever seen,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was quirky and funny and an overall great story about a dysfunctional couple who can't seem to stay away from each other. I thought that both Annie and Alvy's awkwardness was hilarious and in all honesty I though they made a perfect couple. I thought it was really cute when Annie moved to California and Alvy said that he would go over there and get her himself. I thought he was just playing around but he actually flew out to California to coerce her into coming back to New York. He even rented a car which he drove horribly, even worse than Annie. I also loved all the cool things Woody Allen did while they were filming. Like when he and Annie were standing in line to see a movie he approached the camera and started talking to audience as if they were also in the room. Also other things like when he and Annie were in bed and he wouldn't let her smoke pot before they made love and a ghost of her representing her mentality walked away and sat on a chair; he acknowledged the fact that she was not mentally there and talked to the apparition of her to represent that. It was just interesting the things he did to represent certain situations and how he made the audience feel apart of the movie and knowing his inner thoughts.",,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best-remembered films of the '70s,"In 1977, everyone was talking about ""Annie Hall,"" Woody Allen's film about a romance gone wrong. There was the ""Annie Hall"" look, ""la-di-da,"" and TV shows ripped off the lobster scene. Thirty-four years later, ""Annie Hall"" still holds up as a great Allen film.Allen breaks the fourth wall and talks directly to the audience. The film is shamelessly biographical - the main character is a neurotic comedian, Alvy Singer, who is well-known. Diane Keaton, for whom the screenplay was written, plays Annie (Keaton's real last name is Hall and people call her Annie).The two meet and make an unlikely couple: she's from the midwest, and he's a native New Yorker and Jewish, growing up under the Coney Island roller-coaster. She's an aspiring singer; he's been in therapy for 15 years. Gradually their differences overwhelm their feelings for one another.The script is fabulous - witty, hilarious, charming, whimsical, and bittersweet. And the chemistry between Allen and Keaton is wonderful. Both are perfect.Tony Roberts plays a friend of Alvy's, Carol Kane plays Alvy's ex-wife, Allison, Paul Simon is Tony Lacey, and Christopher Walken is Annie's brother. His short role is responsible for one of the most hilarious scenes in the film.The film has a very modern perspective - relationships are next to impossible but we need them so we keep trying. As Woody says at the beginning of the film: ""Life is full of loneliness, and misery, and suffering, and unhappiness, and it's all over much too quickly."" We just have to keep slogging through.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Art Comedy,"ANNIE HALL is art comedy. I took some thought into terming it; ""comedy art"" suggests that its gags are artistic while my belief is that this is ""art comedy"", art that happens to make you chuckle. I consider MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL and AIRPLANE! to be ""comedy art"". I consider ANNIE HALL ""art comedy"".This is essentially a classic romance told in humorous form. Alvy Singer, played by Woody Allen, is a neurotic, Jewish, New York, stand-up comedian who refuses to change. Annie Hall, played by Diane Keaton, is a capricious, Midwest raised, New York living, fashion setting woman who sings in a nightclub. It's the story of their love, a love which is not perfect but needed. There's happiness, sadness, symbolism, literary allusions, fourth-wall demolition, and even animation. There are struggles between fantasy and reality. There are bittersweet moments of romantic futility. There are two spiders the size of Buicks. It's wistful, it's psychological, and it's even funny.If you only saw the earlier Woody Allen films, such as BANANAS or SLEEPER, before this movie, as I did, you may be surprised by the difference between this and those. Those films were more farcical, slapstick, and contained more music. ANNIE HALL does not have those sequences where a silent slapstick routine is set to sprightly music. In fact, not even the opening and closing titles have any music of any sort. There's a quick clip of music after a car ride, there's the music heard while in the movie theatre, and Diane Keaton sings twice (the second song is repeated before the end credits). But it's probably just as well. A slapstick routine would seem out of place in this touching, distinctly human story of imperfect but indispensable love.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woddy Allen's Best!,"Annie Hall is simply one of the greatest, most complete, interesting, witty, funny, romantic, sweet, and utterly intelligent movie ever projected on big, white screen. In fact, it is most possibly the single most intelligent movie ever made. The story follows Alvy Singer (Allen), a new york comedian, and his very odd romance with the tittle character, Annie Hall (beautifully portrayed by Diane Keaton). Both Allen and Keaton deliver two of the most masterfully funny performances ever given. Though the relationship between both Keaton and Allen in real life would seem a little strange, Allen being a middle-aged basket case, and Keaton being a much younger, much more beautiful free-spirit kind of Hippie-chick, the two still have engaging chemistry nad make a surprisingly convincing couple. Annie Hall is, and always will be, my favorite movie, every single second is just purely enjoyable. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has ears! 10 out of 10 quality!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I liked the frequent fourth wall breaks and sometimes different formats, such as the interactive flashback scenes. Most of the things I didn't like were some of the opinions expressed by Woody Allen's character. I was often confused also by the two main characters' relationship.

Woody Allen is FUNNY,"I didn't know anything about Woody Allen except his caricature, which was famous and often parodied in the 90's (small, neurotic, tremulous, phlegmy stereotypically Jewish New Yorker) and that he married his daughter.I was thus pleasantly surprised to see that he's not only funny, but one of the funniest comedians I've ever seen. And he has a rather unique style, too. It's cerebral, it's quick, it's surprising. His ""bits"" are very seemlessly integrated into the dialogue and into the autobiographical vignettes of his life at this period, something like how the first few seasons of Seinfeld would feature related standup before the ostensibly biographical episodes of his eponymous TV show or how Chris Rock's narration did the same for Everyone Hates Chris.This film's title is a misnomer. It's not actually much about Annie Hall, who is some relationship the Woody Allen character's life. I assume this is a semi-autobiographical work about Woody Allen's life, told within the framework of a relationship he had with a woman apparently at some important transition in his life.The relationship is tumultuous, sometimes because Singer (the pseudonym of Woody Allen here) is afraid of commitment, sometimes because Annie Hall, while apparently deeply attracted to Singer, yearns for something else. That variable tension and attraction that exists in the unreconcilable relationships between most men and women, who alternate between loving (or desiring) and hating each other is always present.Through the lens of this relationship, he reflects on past relationships, the meaning of love, his professional career, compatibility between two people, and both resolved and unresolved life problems he has at around the age of 40.The style and directing are fresh. It's told in a linear narrative, but lots of interesting things are done with the scenes. Sometimes memories will interact with the present, Allen will interact with extras, or two characters in different scenes will engage in dialogue between the transition. It's all very smooth and I haven't seen much of this since.Annie Hall isn't a comedy. There's always some tension in the air and it's clear from the beginning this isn't going to have a happy resolution. Indeed it doesn't. It's a frank and philosophical look into romantic relationships, which can often be maudlin in an age where choice and urban living makes it easy to window shop or frivolously unhitch ourself from relationships, probably more often that not leading to regrets or feelings of loss.Honourable Mentions: Back to School (1986). A less melancholy movie that integrates Rodney Dangerfield's signature one-liners seemlessly into the script and plot. I thought that was the paragon of films being integrated with comedians' bits, but Annie Hall puts up a good fight.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
100 % Woody Allen,"This is no doubt an intelligent and innovating movie with a strong cast, but like most Woody Allen movies, at times it can be a little annoying. The movie is like one big conversation and along the conversations you see slowly a plot moving. Maybe that is where its strength and its weakness lies.Woody Allen's Character 'Alvy Singer' is a neurotic comedian who is very cynical about life. This shines through in every conversation and demonstrates a particular type of humor which I personally liked, but you may find annoying.Diane Keaton plays the character 'Annie Hall', who gets involved with Alvy and has very interesting and plausible character development along the way. Not like the usual I like him - I Like him not - I Like him again, but in my opinion much closer to real life.Therefore, if you like Woody Allen, see it, if you don't like him, leave it and if you don't know him, try it!

Contender For Worst Best Picture,"Annie Hall, directed, written, and starring Woody Allen, begins as a witty, likable, and hilarious film that had me in tears during a few scenes. However, as the film grows on, it develops a certain tedium, and eventually becomes a redundant and repetitive film with an annoying lead performance.Woody Allen starts off as a brilliantly written character, with tons of neurotic quirks that make him unique. Jewish jokes aside, his comedic performance was very charismatic. However, an hour into the film, I found myself annoyed by the sound of his voice, and the frequency he would complained about the most mundane of things. This is where the shift into tedium begins, because this whole time I was wishing the film would end so I would no longer have to hear him talking. The same here goes for Diane Keaton, who I loved at first, but I eventually grew annoyed with as time went on. And their insistence on being annoying could've been intentional, there's no denying that, but that doesn't make it any less annoying, and it doesn't stop Woody Allen from type- casting himself in his own movie.One thing I can certainly compliment is the exquisite direction. I've always been a huge fan of long takes, making the feeling of the film more intimate, and this film features tons of those. There is a brilliant shot where, Woody and his friend are walking down the street, and we here them talking, but they're not yet in frame or just out of frame. As the shot and conversation continues, we see two individuals come down the street casually, and eventually we see this is Allen and his friend. The shot then continues and follows them where they're walking. It's brilliant, and in some scenes it even heightens the comedic value, especially in the scene when they're waiting in the line at the movie's with the film snob talking pretentiously behind them.There's no doubt here that the writing here is also very well done, until the third act, because in typical comedy fashion, it brings in the dramatic plot that you don't care about,and drops nearly all of the jokes, making it even more tedious than it already was. But nonetheless, there's lots of hilarious chemistry between Keaton and Allen, especially in the lobster scene, which I found to be one of the most genuinely written in the film. The characters talk quickly too, so reading the Oscar-winning screenplay is only that much better for helping you catch all of the jokes you might have missed.This film's winning of the Best Picture Oscar however emphasizes it's rather OK quality. Make no mistake, this is a well directed, well acted, and well written film until the third act comes in. But it's that third act that simply makes the movie OK. A bad ending is certainly worse than a bad beginning, because an audience member is more akin to remember a movie finishing bad, then starting good, and vice versa. This is a bit of a generic romcom the more I think about it, with a few artistic quirks. It's certainly not the worst Best Picture, that honor goes to either Driving Miss Daisy or Shakespeare in Love, but nonetheless, this is your typical overrated classic which people praise but don't watch.I recommend it to someone who's an Oscar completionist or somebody who just wants a quick laugh with an artistic edge, but anybody else, especially people who aren't already fans of Woody Allen, should stray away from this.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thinly veiled self-glorification,"Woody Allen's puerile comedy reaches a true dramatic climax through a bit of unintended irony in the often-discussed ""movie line"" scene.  In this scene we witness one pedant criticizing the pedantry of another in the middle of what is essentially a 90 minute diatribe.  This scene sets up the remainder of an unbelievably hubristic film in which we will watch Woody (Why does he bother calling himself Alvy?) promoting the person he admires most.  I'm still trying to understand how some might construe an assembly of self-consciously scripted one-liners as a coherent story.  The humor in this film was so contrived that I began waiting for drumrolls after lines like ""I never undress in front of a man of my own gender"" and even began to wonder if a few years in Manhattan would see Rodney Dangerfield swapping jokes with Allen in an onstage partnership. By the time Woody uses all of the affect he can muster to pull off a suddenly sentimental closing scene, I refused to believe that he actually felt capable of evincing some sort of emotional response from the audience. Pathos is never a temptation for the viewer who is simply not interested in Woody Allen's life or those of celebrities in general.As for the purported technical brilliance of the film (obnoxious postmodern pandering), I found it to be a hackneyed hodgepodge of Nouvelle Vague tricks pulled off with much less tact.  For the sake of comparison, a film that does pull all of these elements together in a brilliantly funny and emotive package is Truffaut's ""Shoot the Piano Player.""  ""Annie Hall"" was my first Woody Allen film and will probably be the last.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Inarguably one of Allen's Best, perhaps THE best","This film may be the greatest single study of a relationship ever put to celluloid. It captures two distinct and fully realized characters at a specific time in their lives and shows us, without being too overt, who these people are separately and who they are together. Allen and Keaton have a wonderful neurotic chemistry, which is wonderfully funny without ever being so over-the-top that the characters failed to be believable. Classic scenes abound, including Allen's attempt to do cocaine and Walken in a very early role as Annie Hall's seriously troubled brother, whose monologue to Allen in simply priceless. Also watch for a blink-and-you-missed-it early early appearance by Jeff Goldblum, who delivers what may be the film's funniest single line.All and All, Annie Hall is hilarious and poignant, a perfectly realized dissection of a relationship and the people who are part of it. A witty jazz score, artfully refined cinematography, and a perfect supporting cast round it out to be perhaps Allen's greatest triumph, well deserving of all the praise and - dare I say it? - even worthy of it's victory over Star Wars for Best Picture in 1977.",,Anonymous,Romance

Were I an aspiring filmmaker wanting to delve into comedy, I would make a point of hunting down this one and studying it. Dying, it's been said, is easy- comedy is hard.

Woody Allen at his Best,"One of the great things about the Beatles is we can literally hear them maturing from record to record. From ""Love Me Do"" to ""Yesterday"" to ""Revolution"" in just a few short years.Woody Allen's oeuvre offers the same insight into his creativity. In the early 70s he was making silly slapstick comedies like Bananas and Sleeper. But then he grows up and gets serious and makes Annie Hall and Manhattan. These films have traded screwball comedy for higher brow jokes and more serious dialogue. It's an amazing transition we the movie viewer can watch in realtime.Annie Hall is a great movie. It's funny and romantic and so of its time and place (seventies New York City and LA). Besides the great stars of the film - Woody Allen and Diane Keaton - we get cameos from Paul Simon, Shelley Duvall and Christopher Walken. And if you don't blink you'll even spot Marshall McLuhan (as himself),
Truman Capote (as a Truman Capote lookalike) and Jeff Goldblum (who makes the most of his one line).I know a lot of people can't separate the man from the art. And I respect that. If Allen did the things he's accused of he's a horrible person (the joke in the movie about sleeping with twin 16 year olds is a bit alarming in that light). But if you can, you have to respect Woody Allen's productivity through the decades. I haven't loved every one of his films (heck I've probably only seen about half of them) but when he gets it right he gets it really right. In Annie Hall he got it as right as he ever did.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
*TOTALLY* OVERRATED!!,"Everybody cites this film as a Woody Allen favorite, I really can't agree, though I'd concede it was a critical milestone in his ongoing evolution as a great American writer/director.  It has a few good laughs, a few insights into Woody's psyche (though these are not necessarily general insights), but in the end it doesn't really leave you with much to take away.  I liked ""Hannah and Her Sisters"" much better, it has all the laughs and insights ""Annie Hall"" had but is  much, much deeper, and it leaves you with a life-affirming and *positive* ending unlike most of his movies before!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Seminal comedy love story that helped give birth to the romcom,"Roger Ebert, great film critic, came to think of Annie Hall as the first of a trilogy, the other two films being Manhattan and also Hannah and Her Sisters. A nice idea, but let's not forget that Allen's nefarious nocturnal comedy of the 1990s, Manhattan Murder Mystery (MMM), was originally conceived as part of what became Annie Hall; so in a sense, Allen's reunion with Diane Keaton for MMM is a kind of sequel to Annie Hall.Both movies have that irresistible rapport between the co-stars, but Annie Hall is surely the cleverest comedy of 'nervous romance' that Allen ever conceived? It was recognised as a happening, a moment in cinematic history, even at the time, and audiences queued round the block to see it. The sheer number of Oscar nominations (4 wins), and for a film that probably wasn't perceived as nakedly commercial, attests to its glory. Of course, the one who really can't see the wood for the trees where Allen's movies are concerned is Woody himself. Does he really think that Match Point is a better film than Annie Hall? I guess the creator is not the receiver of his creation.If you couple this film with another from the same year, Neil Simon's The Goodbye Girl (Oscar for Richard Dreyfuss) then you have the mummy and daddy of the romantic comedy genre. Even as famous a romcom as When Harry Met Sally is totally indebted to Annie Hall. A later film like Keeping The Faith (director Ed Norton) reeks of Annie Hall. The list could go on. Annie gave birth to so many admirable, derivative, haphazard rom-coms. One needn't stop with Annie of course. Would the makers of TV sitcom Friends have thought to make Ross get divorced because his wife had an affair with another woman if Woody hadn't given them the idea in Manhattan?One thing that makes Annie Hall fascinatingly different from later Allen films is the lack of music. There is live music such as when Annie sings, or when they go to a party, but little in the way of soundtrack music. The film is headily autobiographical, Allen playing the part of a standup comedian, Alvy Singer, and Keaton wearing her own clothes and becoming a style icon. By the time they began making movies together their real life romantic relationship was over, and how lucky for all of us that they were able to work together happily and remain friends even to this day. If you've never seen Allen's 'roast' of Keaton before handing her the AFI lifetime achievement award (c.2018) look it up, it's hilarious. In that same speech at the awards ceremony he acknowledges his debt to her, how she opened his eyes to the world, how he learned to write women so well thanks to his relationship with her off and on screen (they must have done nine or so movies together). Really, this is Keaton's film as much as his.It is the story of what went wrong, of how two people can love each other but not be meant for one another. It is one of Allen's most poignant and insightful comedies, and the fact that he himself doesn't rate it very highly matters not a jot, for if he ignores the popular consensus then it behoves us, the viewers, to dismiss his own brand of foolishness and celebrate what we know to be meaningful. Annie Hall is for many people Allen's best movie, or else his second best; maybe third, but no lower than that. It is his cleverest comedy, his best acting performance (he was nominated for writing, directing and acting), and has been a source of inspiration to filmmakers and viewers for generations. So deal with that, Woody! We need the eggs.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Garbage -- skip it,"I watched ""Annie Hall"" for the first time yesterday and hated it. I found it to be deplorable to be honest. It shows terrible morals, terrible stereotypes, terrible attitudes, and terrible scripting and editing. I have virtually nothing good to say about this film. 1/10 rating -- avoid. Appalling that this film won the Oscar instead of ""Star Wars"" in 1977. That's ok though, it just shows what poor taste the ""tastemakers"" have and how we should ignore them and their views. I found Allen to be an annoying bigot who ironically thinks everyone else is a bigot. Well, newsflash, the people obsessed with our differences, whether race or religion, and who compulsively drone on about it while reinforcing negative presumptions and stereotypes are the true bigots who are holding society back from healing and progressing. Yes, of course many terrible things have occurred in this world, but the answer is to love ourselves and others, at least until they give us a reason not to -- everyone deserves a chance from us. And the reality is that most people are not bigoted, but rather just focused on themselves, it is all most can do to get through life, fighting health difficulties and financial troubles, etc. Most have no time to be concerned with someone else's skin color or religion. It's the worst type of conceit, ignorance, and hypocrisy to project one's own bigotry onto others.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

This is unquestionably one of the funniest, warmest and most enduring films of the late 20th century, and -- of all Allen's films -- the one easiest to return to time and time again.  In the swiftness of its editing (there isn't a wasted frame in the whole picture), the depth of colour in the cinematography, the fashion-leading costumes by a young Ralph Lauren, and particularly in Diane Keaton's luminous performance, this is a masterpiece of modern cinema.  Allen presents New York as a world in which he (in his own way) is master -- walking the streets with purpose, haunting bars and restaurants, playing out his life against the backdrop of Manhatten.  There are countless moments of inspired invention: the film is bursting with ideas. Go and see it, whether a Woody",,Anonymous,Romance

Worthy of Best Picture,"In his prime, Woody Allen has made masterpieces. They mostly make us laugh, but then came Annie Hall, and we are so entranced by the fact that this is not just a comedy, but while being extremely funny, also has a deep message to it, with an amazing love story, questioning parts, and a wonderful ending. It becomes clear in the first 15 minutes of the film that this is an auto-biographical film, where Mr. Allen shows us his life as he would like to have lived it, where he could easily waltz back in time to re-live some of his more happier memories, and where he can make whatever he wants happen. But he doesn't abuse the privilege, as there is a story to tell. Through many unusual camera angles, various music breaks, and lots of humor, the plot unfolds, and we find ourselves most captivated by Mr. Singer's love for Mrs. Annie Hall, played by the lovely Diane Keaton, who won an Oscar for her role. This film can get a little confusing at times, mainly because it is not chronological, but rather skips around to many various points in the story until the very end where everything comes together in a finale fit for a king. This picture scooped up Best Picture, Actress, and Director Oscars, and is still hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time by movie goers everywhere.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Allens use of humour was also innovative at the time (eg speaking directly to the camera and his use of subtitles when talking to Keaton in one scene) that gives the film an unbelievably charming feel.perhaps its that i see a bit of myself in Alvy Singer, perhaps its because of its location, perhaps its a lot of things. but i just cant get enough of this film. it has everything that i like and respect in movies. id give only a handful of films iv ever seen 10/10. this is one of them. brilliant.",,Anonymous,Romance

the quintessence of Allen's mood,"Let's first admit I am not among Woody Allen's fans, but after having seen and liked ""Whatever works"" and discovered its script went back to the same period as Annie Hall, I felt like seeing it. Let's also admit I watched it in company of my parents who constantly repeated to themselves how it was possible to award it with the Oscar as best movie, and how it was possible to found a movie on talking, walking, talking while walking, walking while talking.... quite a funny condition to see one of Allen's best creation.The movie is a romantic and ""cerebral"" comedy about man-woman relationship, seen from the point of view of a neurotic, nerve-wracking and too a self-conscious man, Alvy Singer, the prototype of many of Allen's characters, you may love or hate him abut he cannot leave you indifferent, and I would like to cite Roger Ebert when he says that Alvy is ""a seeker of the unattainable and an expert at making it unattainable, he is not a victim of forces beyond his control, but their author"", as they can best summarize the condition of this eccentric, almost border-line man.There are extremely funny moments, as when he says that has been attending an analyst for fifteen years, and he will allow him another year before going to Lourdes: what strikes you as odd and disarming is the naturalness and immediacy when he pronounces such philosophical sentences or quotations, so that you can either laugh or despise him. I liked him, although I must admit that his neurotic talkativeness sometimes gets annoying, but in the end I cannot deny the movie is involving and innovative for the seventies. As I had said in my review of ""Whatever works"", old age make people, if not wiser, more disillusioned, and more at ease with the bitterness of life, I think that in Annie Hall's script we could have never found the idea that ""Every temporary measure of grace"" is the best we can obtain from life. Annie Hall reveals a yearning for life, even only for a speculation about life that ""Whatever works"" puts aside in favour of a more disenchanted view and comforting final happy ending, but it is undoubted that the neurotic and sometimes pedantic nature of Allen's movies, characters, and probably nature, belong to both movies.You may love or hate it, but I think ""Annie Hall"" is a must see movie for all those who like thinking about life and about the ""irrational"" quality of man-woman relationship.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody at his best.,"Intelligent and still fresh to this very day. The amount of movies it has inspired is amazing - When Harry Met Sally (1989) probably being my favourite comparison.But with Annie Hall, there isn't really a comparison. It is the best romantic comedy ever. What was initially a three hour long film, called Anhedonia, was cut down to the succinct hour and half comedy we have with us today. The non-linear narrative really gives this film an edge on other comedies. It feels like memories of a relationship, being remembered in patches.Diana Keaton is great as the titular character, Annie Hall. Teeming with flaws, and quirkiness, Keaton creates a fully believable character - one that is enhanced even more by the appearance of Alvy Singer, Woody's character. Woody Allen is so funny in this movie, possibly Allen at his creative best. The jokes are intelligent, they move along well, and are - most importantly - varied. The subtitle scene, or where Alvy goes to Annie's house for dinner - and Grammy the Jew hater sees him - oh, it's just classic.I can't say any more than that. It really is funny - there are too many moments to mention. It is well acted, written and directed, with great pacing. If you are a Woody fan, I can't think of many comparisons to Annie Hall. Manhattan, another classic, is nothing like this movie, instead opting for a more melancholy mood. It isn't a period piece like the average Curse of the Jade Scorpion or the fantastic Purple Rose of Cairo. Annie Hall really is unique in his collection, with inventive jokes, the lively nature of the story and the way it involves the audience. Although people call this film romantic, it is actually quite the opposite at the end. Similar to Manhattan in that respect, but at least Annie Hall contained more laughs.You won't feel cold watching this movie. Go and get it now, it is fantastic cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The creative genius who needs to stay off his actresses,"Annie Hall is one of Woody Allen's most original and refined films. Its really too bad he had to put himself in most of the sex scenes. Meh! And hearing him moaning during those sex scenes... Gag!

I know a lot of Star Wars fans are annoyed by Annie Hall beating Star Wars at the Academy Awards and winning the best picture prize. To those of us who have seen Star Wars and Annie Hall, and don't have a Wookie bias, its easy to see which is the superior film. Star Wars was not as refined, and the writing in Annie Hall was much stronger.If you haven't seen this gem, you should definitely check it out. It might become one of your favorite comedies.

Seems like old times,"'Annie Hall', Woody Allen's sublime romance of 1977 hasn't aged a single second since its release. The fabulous interplay between Woody Allen as Alvy Singer, firing all his cylinders (in his best acting performance) and the lovely Diane Keaton as the title-character, and they create such a vivid, colorful, charming and enjoyable core in this Best Picture-winning masterpiece of comedy and romance, but strangely and absolutely most interestingly is that it's not really your average romantic comedy; there are great moments of slapstick, brilliantly witty dialog, technical wizardry by adding cartoons, ""subtitling minds"", doing Bergmansque and Fellini-ish (his two great inspirations) elements and scenes, great and effortless lapses in time and place, and great insights into different New York-lives and stereotypes acted out by Paul Simon, Shelley Duvall and Christopher Walken.And throughout the 90 minutes duration-time the romance between Alvy (Allen) and Annie (Keaton) flourishes in its own pace and naturalism, even though it is surrounded by Woody Allen's aforementioned talent and ideas at his most inventive, that simply enhances the story. The greatly nostalgic ending gives you that longing yet satisfied feeling of what love brings into life, and the completely silent credit-roll is another stroke of genius from Allen as you simply want to see it again and again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

There are many references to literature and film that make the film all the more rich with different levels of comedy.

What's the big deal?,"Going into this, all I've ever heard about this movie, is that it's a classic, and one of the best films of all time, not to mention the best Woody Allen film. But, after having just seen it, I'm left with a sense of disappointment. It's not at all the sentimental journey I was expecting, and in fact I found it to be a little silly at times. And, although that's to be expected with any Allen film, I was anticipating something a little more sincere with this piece.Diane Keaton was very good in this, and I can see why so many people consider this to be her signature role, however you still see her has Diane Keaton, and not as the character Annie Hall. This, in my opinion was not her best role and she did not strike me as brilliant, as she did for me in 'Marvin's Room'. Woody Allen likes to write roles for himself, and instead of giving himself a character name in each of his films, he should just simply be called Woody, since he's always playing himself. He's a much better writer and director than he is actor, but I don't think I'm alone in this thought.The film itself is cute, and sweet, but it's nothing extraordinary. I would say that it's not bad, but then again, it's not terribly terrific either. I would recommend it, but not before a few of Allen's better films, such as; ""Everyone Says I Love You"" and ""Manhatten Murder Mystery"".",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Allen's Best.,"I am an unabashed Woody Allen fan. Now, I know that most of us native New Yorkers are predisposed to liking Woody. I have found many midwesterners and Californians who ask why I like him, and, after a collection of well-thought-out reasons, they nod their heads knowingly and dismissingly if I mention that I am originally from New York City.This movie, though, is about more than New York vs. L.A. It's about more than Jew loves Shiksa. It's about love, life, and disappointment, and it is put together in a very entertaining and precocious way. This is a film maker stretching the envelope. Only Woody Allen could come up with the idea of pulling Marshall Macuhan from behind a billboard to berate a pseudo-intellectual for him. Leave it to a warped mind to toss in an animated section where his love becomes the evil queen from ""Snow White."" And the subtitled sequence is just perfect.As with most geniuses, there are many who may not ""get"" what Woody is trying to say. This is a film, though, that can be seen a hundred times, and something new will pop out every single one of those times. Take it from me; I wrote a sixty page thesis on this movie, and after watching it nearly every day for a semester, I was still learning and discovering.Woody is in the doghouse these days because of some questionable personal choices.

Allen's first masterpiece,"Woody's first mature film after the early funny ones breaks new ground with its interesting technique of having characters talk to earlier versions of themselves that they visit in flashbacks. He also has the characters voice their inner thoughts to funny effects. It was rightfully acclaimed at the time of its release. In retrospect, this film is still wonderful but has lost some of its edge because the remarkably prolific Allen has since made a number of films that are equally good and at least one, ""Manhattan,"" that is better.

Transcends genre and time.,"Annie Hall is a story about intimate relationships where Woody Allen breaks down the fourth wall, and talks directly to the camera, which at first glance appears awkward, but later conforms to the average movie goers comfort level when he pulls out a person playing himself from behind a life size cardboard figure. The story is shot in New York, and then transfers to Los Angeles for a short time. There is a comparison of each city's lifestyles which is very interesting. It appears that Allen dislikes LA more than New York because of his negative depiction of the bright sun suit his good friend wears to ""keep healthy"", and Allens negative rant about how LA always gives awards out.The writing is presented in a way which conveys Allen's unique perspective on life, and his courage is displayed to the world when he compares the old Marx brothers joke by saying, ""Maybe I don't want her because I don't want to be part of a club who would have me as a member"". We can better understand his dilemma dealing with relationships. This frankness makes him more lovable and able to connect with. Another example of great writing is when the captions appear during a conversational scene between Woody Allen and Keaton. Most people have experienced this subtext when we deal with human interaction, so we can relate with the actual on screen translation of their thoughts.The acting is some of the best out of all of Woody Allen's movies. The real life concurrent relationship Allen had with Diane Keaton (Annie Hall) helps to convey a true on screen relationship. The gift the audience will receive is a unique relationship we can all relate to. Perhaps most subtle is the performances by Christopher Walken, whom creates one of the funniest scenes ever to be captured on the big screen. It is typical for Allen to create awkward tension between himself and other women, but seldom has he written such an endearing thoughtful film which has transcended genre and time.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Allen,"Today, my buddy KGE and I decided to make it a Woody Allen day, and this is the first of two films we chose.Premiering at the 1977 Los Angeles Film Festival, Annie Hall is one of the highest-grossing films in Allen's filmography. It bears the hallmarks of the first half of his career: jazz, New York, and people communicating within the confines of their own neuroses.Alvy and Annie's relationship reflects a stereotype about gender differences in sexuality, with Singer embodying the cliché of the neurotic Jewish male. As time went on, the character of Alvy became synonymous with Woody Allen's public persona in the US... This film, which has been read by nearly a hundred thousand people over the past 50 years, remains a masterpiece even in 2024.It's a testament to Woody Allen's talent, despite him being his own worst enemy and the saboteur of his own career (thankfully, a clumsy one at that).And yet, he remains my favorite director, with a shelf, even a wall, dedicated to him in my room.The film's enduring appeal lies in its sharp wit, insightful observations about relationships, and its unique blend of comedy and melancholy. Allen's trademark neurotic humor is on full display, as Alvy constantly dissects his own anxieties and insecurities. Diane Keaton's Annie is a breath of fresh air, a free-spirited and charming woman who challenges Alvy's cynicism.The film's non-linear structure, with its flashbacks, dream sequences, and fourth-wall breaks, is both innovative and engaging. It allows Allen to explore the complexities of memory and perception, as well as the challenges of communication and intimacy.Annie Hall is not just a romantic comedy; it's a meditation on love, life, and the human condition. It's a film that has resonated with audiences for decades, and it continues to be a source of laughter, tears, and thought-provoking insights.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

What made it a step above other romantic comedies is definitely the script. It is hilarious, it develops the characters successfully, it is 100% entertaining.Woody Allen is incredibly funny. I love his sense of humor, I love how ""neurotic"" he is. I was laughing so so much during this movie. He brilliantly portrays his character, as does Keaton portray hers.

"Most overrated movie of the 70's, which is saying a lot","I saw this movie in a New Humanities class. What a waste of 93 minutes. The viewing was in the afternoon, around 2:00, and I could barely keep my eyes open while watching this snore-fest.This movie is not funny. Many of my fellow students were laughing at Allen just because he is such a loser and over-analyzes everything. Well whoop-dee-doo. There is no explosiveness to this alone...it's like telling the story of a joke but forgetting the punchline. But this style of comedy is praised because it's supposedly ""sophisticated."" Yeah, right. There was only one sophisticated joke that made me laugh. This joke was about meta-physics, and I actually let out a brief chuckle. There were 30 people screening the movie with me, and it went over every one of their heads. Yes, I was the only one who understood the joke enough to laugh. I'm considered to be a pretty sophisticated guy, and it's a sad testament to a film if it does not even appeal to its target audience. That's because anyone who is intelligent enough to know what these Woody Allen sex and obscurity jokes actually mean has enough sense not to laugh at the trash. This just reinforces the fact that it's overrated.Another reason why I say confidently that not only Annie Hall is overrated, but Woody Allen in general is that he received multiple Oscar nominations. What a joke. You're telling me that Woody Allen is the best director, best screenwriter, and one of the best actors in a leading role? For this garbage? Well, I guess it's safe to say that Woody Allen single handedly beat the entire film industry with this movie then. When Orson Welles received similar praise from the Academy for Citizen Kane, it was 1941, and he beat the odds by making a decent flick back when movies had an excuse to suck...and there was almost no quality competition.This film should be praised for its realism, seeing as it is just as funny as your average Joe Schmoe's non-eventful life...which isn't worth viewing in the first place. One thing's for sure, this movie does not deserve a tenth of the praise it gets.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Probably one of the best of Allen,"If you look upon all Woody Allen's movies, I still think that Annie Hall is one of the best. Every time I have seen it, it has opened for a new way to understand it. And simultaneously it is like a person you've known as a good friend, whom you like to see again and again. And it is in no ways made as a masterpiece. It is maybe good as a cliché of all what Woody Allen has made, and I think he has later repeated himself in later movies which are not so well known as this. The psychological syndrome named after Mr. Allen owes probably to this movie. What makes this movie to what it is, is really it's simplicity in the middle of all the many words which characterize the Allen movie and it's syndrome. Compared with ""When Harry met Sally"" it has something that makes it much more serious and less mainstream. This movie takes place in what is in a different world than where I live in. It is close to ""Take the money and run"" or better, ""Play it again Sam"", but a milestone better than that. ""Manhattan"" is a good drink but much more ambitious and artistic and therefore not as natural or down to earth as this: ""You are New York""!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Old Love,"This movie is all about the life of Alvy Singer and how he reflects on his life. He had always believed that love was overrated but from some reason also desired it. After meeting singer Annie Hall, he realizes that love may not be as overrated as he thinks. Singer talks about the struggles he faced while dating Annie. He briefly talked about his childhood and how his life led up to where it was with Annie. He takes the audience on an emotional roller coaster when we watch the ups and downs that take place between him and Annie. I would recommend this movie for others to see, especially those who are lovers of romance movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hilarious and Original,"Watching a film like Annie Hall is a breath of fresh air. An breath so fresh, it changes your outlook on life. Annie Hall is an unparalleled romantic comedy and sets a precedent for films to come for ages. With its scattered narrative structure and outré characters, Annie Hall settles right at the top of the list of romantic comedies that are actually worth it to the audience. Woody Allen infuses his peculiar, masterful script with different strategies and innovative methods of storytelling.Allen's biggest ally in Annie Hall is himself. Writer, director, and protagonist. Allen invents his own style to create irony and make the adult audience laugh. He is wonderful at thinking up the most strange, unusual things that are hilarious such as eating soup in a house under a subway and the many Jewish jokes. Allen knows what he's doing, all aspects of his work is dynamic. The main character is a difficult person, who knew that difficult people in life could bring send such positive vibes to the world?Humor. Humor. Humor. Annie Hall forges strength from the humor. The film opens with a mildly devastating thought about life, however, but it fits with the tone film wonderfully. Allen really captures the essence of life and love with every line that's written. The film stands on its own two feat so well because it's a mature, realistic, adult film at heart. Diane Keaton is as cute as a smiley face on a cupcake the title character and creates a dignified female character. Allen is genus, but you can't help wonder who was the real life Annie Hall that inspired this film.Woody Allen proliferated the genre and film audiences expectations of romantic comedies. The beauty with Annie Hall is with all the crazy spins Allen puts on the genre into his short, clean film is that it never feels as weird as it actually is. It's a movie that still resembles a movie, and not an attempt to make something so far out there it's unreachable to the average moviegoer. It will satisfy the next Joe wanting to be entertained for ninety minutes, but will thrill film lovers dying for a new life to the genre.Rating: 9.5/10Grade: A",,Anonymous,Romance
A neurotic rom-com,"Forty seven years later and this is still an outstanding romantic comedy. It is still smart, witty and above all, funny. Woody Allen has made many excellent films and this, despite being probably his most acclaimed, it's not my favorite Allen film. However, it is the peak of his neurotic Jewish schtick act, which to be honest, is the same performance he has given in all of his films that he appears in and a number of times when he's not in front of the camera, he has cast an actor to perform a similar character. I suppose some could say that he is a one trick pony in a sense except for the fact that his writing is so smart and sharp this character nearly always works in a large number of his films. This film made Diane Keaton a star helped with release the same year of Looking For Mr. Goodbar. This is more lightweight than the other that year, but she is a delight here. I haven't any recollection of seeing this other than when it was released, so I was kind of surprised at how little of it dates. It's kind of hard to imagine this winning a best picture Oscar today over Star Wars, but that's what it did in 1977. Probably deserved it too, though my favorite film of this particular year is still Close Encounters of the Third Kind.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Woody Allen masterpiece,"Wildly imaginative, surreal, and sophisticated, Annie Hall is one of Woody Allen's most high quality and finely tuned films. It is a reflection on himself, society, and the ideals of relationships. In the film Allen plays comedian Alvy Singer, a neurotic and pessimistic man whose views on the world are dark and brooding, yet displayed in the most sardonic and sarcastic kind of dry humor that Woody Allen is known for. His girlfriend is Annie Hall, played by Diane Keaton. She is equally neurotic, yet much more optimistic about the world which leads her to very ditsy and almost naive. These two polar opposite personalities somehow fall in love, creating an adorable, awkward, and very real relationship. The film is an insightful and innovative look into 70's romance.Woody Allen's unique film techniques that almost cannot be defined in words are extremely prevalent in this movie. There are many moments that existentially reflect the characters relationships with each other and the world around them. Allen employs things like breaking the fourth wall and talking directly to the audience. Various times in the movie the characters will visit one location and see themselves in scenes that took place in the past. It's weird to put it in words like that, but the way it is used in the film is incredibly effective and interesting, while also giving me a good laugh as the characters non chalantly react to their own memories. The characters continue this feeling of, in a way, self awareness that they are in a cinematic vision, allowing the director to show them what he pleases, when Allen even uses subtitles in one scene to reflect what the characters are thinking when they say certain things, once more conveying a self reflection of their own subconscious. The incredibly creative things Woody Allen puts in this movie are some things that you really just have to see for yourself, and describing them simply in words doesn't at all do it justice.Annie Hall wouldn't be such a great movie if it wasn't carried so well by the two lead actors. Woody Allen's three way talent between a director, writer, and actor is absolutely amazing. He and Diane Keaton drive this film so well, and the amount of strange and authentic chemistry they have together is something so unique and fantastically unconventional. This on screen romance plays out and is orchestrated with such simple brilliance, setting this film far apart from most romances. Woody Allen is an expert with characters, and a lot of that is due to his own bizarre and complicated personality. So many of Allen's films can be interpreted as autobiographical, giving them all a very personal experience reflected for the audience. At the same time, if films like Annie Hall are self reflective of Allen, they are also very self critical. Allen exemplifies all of his characters flaws so strongly, often pointing them out himself. But its this kind of dedication and personal importance of Allen's films that make them one of a kind.You'll never find a director quite like Woody Allen. All of his films have their own unique spark, and odd quirk to them. Annie Hall is no exception. It is so strange, yet at the same time feels so normal because Allen's unique ability at constructing the most authentic character studies seen in cinema. It's difficult to put some of the originality of Annie Hall into words and it is one of those films you have to see for yourself to understand its subtle and estranged brilliance.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Celluloid Memories,"Whether a relationship is good or bad it is almost impossible to forget. There are those that leave lasting impressions and those that hardly scratch the surface, but all leave something behind. There are memories of the good times, memories of the bad times, memories of the times you wished you did something different, and memories of the things you want to take back. If only there was a way to revisit the past.Woody Allen uses the best tool available: film. Through film, Allen shows us what happened prior, during, and after his relationship with Annie Hall in the film of the same name that turned Allen into a real film maker. Allen wrote, directed, and starred in this odd romance. Allen and Diane Keaton star as Alvy and Annie, a couple living in New York City. Alvy is a fairly well known comedian and Keaton is a singer. This isn't a linear storyline by any means. The film begins with the end and Alvy saying what is going on and how he got there. From there it is a glimpse at his childhood and the events leading up to his relationship with Annie.Allen's witty, neurotic sense of humor makes the smallest of difficulties seem monumental. Cooking lobster or trying to have sex becomes of war of words with the wise cracking Alvy. Unlike a normal storyline, this is all a flashback. Allen is telling the story as a narrator, but not in the usual way of narrating. In the midst of a scene Allen will pull away from the film and talk to the audience, as do other characters on the street.Allen's performance is superb. Keaton, who received an Academy Award for her role, is a free spirited, strong willed companion for Allen. Coupled with Allen's knack for writing, the two comic giants feed off of each other's energy to present a wonderful, dynamic couple. No cliché conversations, no unnecessary scenes, just what is needed to tell this modern love story. Allen stays away from the standard formula of making a romantic comedy, instead breaking the mold for the genre.Annie Hall works on many levels. Its unique presentation of the story, the Academy Award Winning screenplay, its timeless characters, and of course, Woody Allen, for whom this film wouldn't be possible. Without Allen's inspiration, Annie Hall would have fallen in line with all the other love story's and become just another title in the sea that is cinema.Winner of four Academy Awards (actress, screenplay, director, picture), Annie Hall has made it's mark on the art of film making. It continues to be hailed as one of the greatest movies of all time, including this critic.Allen has directed over 40 pictures, all with there own unique style and flare. Annie Hall, without a doubt, is the film that will be remembered. It gave the world something to laugh at and understand.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

An enigma of undeserved recognition,"What a disaster of a film this is. Ironic in that it's everything it touts it hates. It appeals to a certain kind of culture especially at the time of its creation that functions only a thin layer beneath superficiality. As though just because of its constant and worthless, meaningless postmodern cynicism it actually means something real. But it's pure emptiness - there is no feeling or human soul or spirit in any of the film, and the center of it all is Annie and Alvy, with not an ounce of love between them. Plus the latter is excruciating, nauseatingly painful to watch for two minutes let alone ninety.It appeals to the mind, not to the heart. It is exactly the kind of intellectualism it claims to hate.The movie staggers constantly, flickering between occasional bouts of experimental wonder (I loved the animated scene) and rabid pseudo-intellectualist circlejerking. There's some knowledge behind it, but it's only mere name-drops. And again, for a movie about love it certainly is totally devoid of it. There's no real communication between the two main characters, it's all fluff, all gimmick. No genuine emotion exists in Annie Hall the movie.I almost take it as a personal offense that the slopped-up holier- than-thou script is regarded as one of cinema's greatest. If this is our best, I fear we're doomed.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody is funny,"Woody Allen made a more very good film. Annie Hall is as innovative with voice overs, animation, fantasy, and the use of breaking the 4th person boundary. Allen makes us characters into his story by talking to the camera, telling us jokes, and sharing his opinions with us. I found the part with subtitles hilarious and laughed throughout the entire film. The characters themselves are so well defined that they feel real to the viewer. Great filmmaking. Allen is one rare individual in the film business, he can act direct and produce. Put him in a category with Charlie Chaplin and Orsen Wells, as the few that can do it all. I recommend it to anyone who wants to see a great made comedy.",,Anonymous,Romance
Essential Woody,"This was the film that made me a fan of Woody Allen.  It wasn't the first Allen film I'd seen (I saw Deconstructing Harry in theaters before I knew anything at all about Woody Allen), but it made me a fan for life.  This film contains everything modern viewers tend to associate with Allen's work: great dialogue, wonderful humor, elements of philosophy, and a playful, inventive tone.  ""Annie Hall"" is the perfect expression of Allen's overall style.  It is the benchmark against which all his other films are and should be judged.  It is his supreme artistic achievement.It's a wonderful movie.  Uproariously funny in places, but also heartfelt, poignant, touching, warm, and sad.  Alvy Singer is an instantly likeable character.  The first scene, Alvy talking directly to the audience against an empty background, perfectly sets the tone of the film.  It is the ultimate expression of unreality.  Here we have a character, who explicitly refers to himself as a character (i.e., this is not Woody Allen providing a prologue to a film about Alvy Singer, this is Alvy Singer), talking directly to the audience, from where?  From no place.It's not unheard of for a character to talk to the audience.  ""Alfie"", for instance, uses this device throughout.  But usually, there are rules attached.  In ""Alfie"", the title character talks to the audience constantly, but no one else can here what he says.  Occasionally, he gets confused, and says something to another character that he meant to say to us, which they can hear.  But in ""Annie Hall"", this device has no rules whatsoever.  It's entirely haphazard.  Whereas when Alfie steps out of a scene, he becomes removed entirely from the other characters, when Alvy steps out of a scene, Annie might join him.  Or she might not.  (Hmm, Alvy... Alfie... connection?)Anyway, the whimsical approach to a very human, universally identifiable story, is precisely what makes the film so magical.  What makes this film so special is the variety of the techniques employed.  We've talked about direct monologue already, but we also get conversations across a split screen, characters physically moving through and interacting with their own flashbacks, animation... you name it!  Gimmickry?  Well, I don't think so, but I would understand if you did.  This manipulation of the form of the film is absolutely essential, in my opinion, to the fullest exploration of the central character (who is not Annie Hall, but Alvy Singer.... we end up knowing comparatively little about Annie by the end of the film).I could go on all day about this extraordinary film, but I'll stop instead. If you haven't seen it yet, do it!!  At the very least, it's incredibly funny.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Kodak walk through of our embarrassing dating pasts,"A skinny NYC Jewish intellectual and a pretty, but ditsy, WASP from Chippewa Falls give it a go together despite their obvious differences.

Full of truth and embarrassment that pepper the review of the dating histories of these two a-polar personalities giving it a go in 1970's New York City.

A fine film,"At the time it came out, it was a huge hit. At that time in his career, Allen's neurotic persona was the main character of his films. His ethnic neurotic shtick was different than what everyone else was doing, and came off as fresh and funny. He brought in Diana Keaton to play her WASP neurotic persona as his love interest. Allen and Keaton had a winning formula for the 1970s Jewish neurotic plus WASP neurotic, equals successful comedy. ""Annie Hall"" was Allen's first deeper satire and it was successful to the extent of Oscar possibilities. Keaton won the Best Actress Academy Award as the title character and while he didn't win for his performance, Allen won for directing & co-writing the screenplay.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Simply put, incredibly, unbelievably, tremendously overrated","This is one of the most horrible films I have ever seen. I know my films, and I cannot believe the adulation some give this unfunny, unclever mess. This movie came out at a great time for hack Woody Allen - he had 60's and 70's audiences by the throat because they, for some odd reason, loved him for the most part. Fortunately, by the mid-80's people finally started to wise up to this shyster, and that's why every movie he makes completely bombs.It's not about ""getting it"" - oh how I hate it when elitists like Allen fanatics try to pull that crap on people. ""It's just over your head..."" ""Woody is an acquired taste..."" ""He's for sophisticates..."" BULL. He SUCKS. He's a hack.I actually do like a few Woody Allen films. I repeat, ""like."" Play It Again Sam was OK. Broadway Danny Rose was OK. A few more were OK. But really. ""Annie Hall"" is a joke. It's not clever, it's not funny, it's not entertaining, it's a farce. It's a great trick that Allen pulled on audiences and he got away with it. In 1977, he must have been laughing like mad behind everyone's backs. ""I can't believe how great they are saying this movie is!!"" My goodness. You gotta give Allen credit in a strange way though. For putting a mess like this out in theaters takes nerve. Politely smiling while everyone is praising your film that you know is a piece of crap takes nerve. Woody proves that old saying miscredited to P.T. Barnum is totally true!",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Neat(!) Movie,"It's a really funny movie. The romantic storyline is quirky, mainly a curdled Alvy's (Allen) observations on life. So if you don't find this quip amusing, the next will fly by in a flash. Director Allen keeps things moving like a NASCAR rally. Oh, but there's the utterly charming Annie (Keaton). Her ditzy manner is so captivating, I couldn't take my eyes off that perpetual smile. But what's she got to smile about. Alvy sees only life's downsides even if in amusing fashion. The goof ball doesn't realize what a gem he's got, so wrapped up is he in his own curdled world.Allen blends talking to the camera, cartoon inserts, thought captions, and flashbacks in seamless fashion. You never know what's coming next, except it'll be funny. I had my doubts when I turned on the movie, like maybe Allen's been over-praised. But I have to admit, it's a one-of-a-kind that takes a lot of risks, but scores big-time.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Its only agenda should have been comedy, leave all the other stuff at the door.","Woody Allen is a master humourist, few would argue that.  His jokes and observations are so well constructed that it would take more skill to mangle them than it would to get the laughs and recognition they were created for. Ironically, for me, Woody Allen actually proves this HIMSELF a couple of times here.  Wisecracks that seemed faultless on the page are reduced to being merely very funny by Allen's patented nervous delivery.  Some might find that this character makes his humour all the more amusing, but to me, neuroses get old unless they themselves are the target of the funnies.The material is strong enough to ride these slightly irritating tics - what it wasn't strong enough to do was convince me fully that this was an authoritative take on modern social mores and manners.  This is only Allen's perspective, it isn't everybodys - and whilst there's nothing wrong with that if you're only looking to laugh heartily and repeatedly, it does handicap Annie Hall's ambitions to be 'more than just a comedy' somewhat.The structure contributes partly to this, often feeling as it does more like a string of improvised skits than a cohesive movie.  This is just one big Allen standup routine with a basic 'relationship' theme.  I see nothing wrong with that as a concept, but should it really have won Best Picture?I don't understand people who say this film has such a broad scope. Infrequent references to drugs and minor celebrity to illustrate the discomfiture Woody has with the whole issue of 'belonging' aren't enough to qualify it as 'wide-ranging'.  Things like this do the opposite in fact, they are insular details that remind us that this is ""Woody"" we're watching and not some anti-hero that has the same problems we do.What fools people into thinking there's more going on here than 'just' romantic comedy?  Oscars certainly helped (The main ones never having been dished out to so 'vulgar' a genre either before or since) and the idea that this was a 'personal' film from Allen.  It's not, I felt as removed from his character - if not his wisdom - by the end as I did before I began watching. Do I care if I enjoyed the experience and was greatly amused?  Not a jot. Just don't try to sell it to me as some kind of 'profound meditation'.  It's no more that than any other good comedy.  Good comedy does that, though, it deceives us into thinking it's opening up new vistas when really it's the audience that does all the spadework by turning the mirror onto society.Allen's comedy is hilarious enough to be its OWN justification.  It doesn't need lumbering with any kind of 'social significance'.  We do that all too readily ourselves as an audience - as has been shown.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

So I think I'll try to watch some more movies about this guy because I think that with his movies I will see what cinema should be like.

Great Movie,"Rating: 9.2
Overall, a groundbreaking romantic comedy that uses a lot of groundbreaking techniques and themes to paint an accurate portayal of what a relationship looks like.Great Direction (The direction on a macroscale is pretty standard to other comedies from the 1970s; the direction on a microscale is incredible because it uses a lot of groundbreaking techniques (especially when breaking the fourth, inserting the current protagonists into the past, and having the characters have outta body experiences), the interpersonal scenes were incredible because you feel the connection and chemistry that Woody Allen and Diane Keaton have as they try to work through their relationship; the direction of actors is great because it felt like every performance had a strong impact (especially Woody Allen and Diane Keaton); the storytelling is incredibly unique as using the fourth wall made it feel like Woody Allen is talking to the audience, also his use of a non-linear narrative structure emphasized the ebbs and flows of Alvy's relationship with Annie Hall), Very Good to Great Acting (Great from Woody Allen (Was mostly playing himself but his comedic timing and his incredible chemistry with Diane Keaton made this such an iconic performance), Great to Incredible From from Diane Keaton (A truly iconic performance as she shows a lot of character growth throughout the movie as she learns to have an independent mind and take control of her emotions; has incredible chemistry with Woody Allen), Good to Very Good from Tony Roberts (Good chemistry with Woody Allen and helps provide comedic relief when he can), Good from the rest of the cast (Felt polished and helped buttress the two leads, but all of them are just side characters)), Very Good Story (The concept is very simple yet profound because on a surface level, it is just a semi-autobiographical account of Woody Allen and Diane Keaton's relationship, but on a deeper level, it is a holistic image of what a relationship actually looks like; the plot structure is very good because the way they set up the story helped emphasize the history of the relationship (especially with how they used the whole middle of the movie to show its history), the runtime feels just right because there wasn't that much that could've been added; flow between sequences was very good; the character writing is great because it gives a comprehensive look at who Alfy and Annie Hall really are (and how their relationship effects them at different parts of their life)), Great Screenplay (The dialogue is great as it flowed very well and is profound; the humor is great because it is seamlessly embedded into the dialogue (and it is actually funny); the symbolism is profound as the movie tackles so many themes that were not talked about when the film came out (like identity being tied to location, mental illness and therapy, and love/relationships); the foreshadowing is kinda inferred because the way the movie was set up from the beginning, the audience knew where it was heading), Very Good Cinematography (Uses a lot of groundbreaking techniques (like the therapy scene and the flashback scenes) and helped with giving that fourth-wall illusion that Woody Allen is directly talking to the audience), Decent Sound (Pretty Typical 70s sound effects), Great Editing (Felt very groundbreaking for the time as it helped plant characters are different times/spaces in the narrative and helped create some iconic shots (like the therapy scene)), Pacing is just right as it didn't feel too fast or too slow (just the right pace), Climax was executed very well as it brought the narrative to a close as we learned how the story for all the characters ended (and it was in a way that was the most realistic), Tone is very satirical with the way it uses the fourth wall and meta humor (but does have a lot of flavors of 70s comedies), A lot of the lines did not age well (especially with some of the allegations through towards Woody Allen)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Annie Hall Is Iconic,"I am a Woody Allen nut but you don't have to be in order to love this movie. Winner of four Academy Awards, the film brought Woody Allen and Diane Keaton to the top of mainstream Hollywood. Woody Allen was already a successful filmmaker and actor so when this film won 1977 Best Picture becoming a better picture than Star Wars that was all he needed to skyrocket to the top. Even now he remains an acquired taste and a sort of love him or leave him filmmaker. With Annie Hall the quirky barriers were broken down and the movie crossed over into a blockbuster film.There is little question that Woody Allen is a great writer and filmmaker. Even those that don't care for his high brow comedy will admit to his certain brand of genius with a camera and his keen scripts. Along with Marshal Brickman, Allen was also able to secure and Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and Best Director. Allen chose not to be present at the awards.Annie Hall is about the romantic adventures of neurotic New York comedian Alvy Singer and his equally neurotic girlfriend Annie Hall. The story follows their relationship from first meeting and the documents their rocky romance while making comments about love during the 1970s. Throughout the movie Allen uses different and innovative ways to tell the story from speaking to the camera, entering other people's narratives and even the clever use of some animation.Of course just like the later Manhattan, Hannah and Her Sisters and Radio Days, Annie Hall clearly has its share of semi-autobiographical elements. The film is total Allen representing the his socially inept and pessimistic view of dating and people bringing all his New York raised bias to bear. The relationship between the two main characters is also autobiographical as Allen and Diane Keaton dated and had a breakup in the early 1970s.Annie Hall gave Woody Allen a chance to capitalize on the success elements from his previous films with the subjects of anti-Semitism, life, romance, professional angst, drugs and death, his obsessive love of New York. Themes that would continue in his films until present day. This film allows his neuroses to take center stage and along with his pessimism and distorted memories of his childhood creates an alter ego for the screen that he refines and which the public comes to think of as actual Woody Allen. This film along with other Allen work combined with his personal life he had chosen to make public come together and make up the true but sort of fictional Woody.Few movies come through American culture and stand the test of time. Annie Hall is a fresh movie today as it was 30 years ago. The comedy is still just as relevant and the New York centeredness still exists 100%. The film has transcended just a flick at the metroplex and is now taught as part of film history at most universities. Annie Hall the character became an iconic figure in the late 1970s just as Annie Hall the movie has become an icon in film and American culture.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Surprisingly Good,"This was the first Woody Allen film that I ever saw. I fully expected to hate Annie Hall, due to the fact my mother told me that his movies are overrated pieces of rubbish. To my surprise I really enjoyed Annie Hall. It is one of the funniest films that I have seen in a long time. The reason I found Annie Hall incredibly funny was because of it's honest portrayal of relationships. One scene I found hysterical was the scene in which Allen and Diane Keaton are having a discussion about photography, while in subtitles we see what they are both thinking. Annie Hall deserved all the awards it won. I look forward to seeing more of Allen's films.",,Anonymous,Romance
An interesting study of a toxic relationship that started with two broken people.,"Although I believe Woody Allen's philosophy to be quite annoyingly pessimistic and desperate, this film shows how relationships start and end.Through the lens of Woody Allen's character, we see how he sees the world, and the way he lives. Although his character is pathetic and sometimes annoying, we can sort of understand what he is going through.The humor is the best part of this film, breaking holes in the facade of flirting and relationships themselves. Although I am not obsessed with the humor on sex or some of the other more obviously laissez faire attitude towards them, most of it is quite funny and honest.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Winner By Woody,"This film might be called the intellectual's comedy. Writer/director Woody Allen sprinkles the dialogue with a healthy dose of grad school references, simultaneously making light of himself and anyone else with pretensions. At the same time, he indulges his whimsical side, freely breaking cinema conventions for laughs.This may be Allen's best film. It did win the Oscar. And it balances Allen's playful, juvenile side with his ponderous, philosophical side.Besides the good supporting cast, this film is an opportunity to spot various actors in cameos, including some who were not well known at the time. Have fun watching for Jeff Goldblum, Shelley Hack, Beverly D'Angelo, Sigourney Weaver, and Truman Capote.While ""Annie Hall"" includes Allen's obsession with death, it's a light, self-deprecating obsession. And its comic style lies somewhere between Monty Python and Jerry Seinfeld.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Film,I saw this film as part of my English class. I enjoyed it throughly! It is a film full of humor  and every minite was enjoyable! The on screen chemistry between the actors is excellent and you could sense they were really close to each other.

"One word ""TERRIBLE"". Degrading to all women","This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I vote this worst movie of 1977.

Excellent,"Probably the best of Woody's romantic comedies. The dialogue, the direction - everything seems perfect. I've seen most of his post-1975 romantic comedies, but this takes the proverbial biscuit. Or lobster.",,Anonymous,Romance
Another Woody musing on love & life,"Long after its release, ""Annie Hall"" has certainly earned all the accolades it's received over the years.  I don't disagree with the Oscar attention it garnered in 1977, but I am surprised; given how Woody has always been an acquired taste for many.  I don't consider this to be Allen's best film (neither does he), but it certainly is one of his accomplished, entertaining films.  Here, Woody plays Alvy Singer, a professional comedian reflecting on his relationship with the title character (wonderfully played, as always, by Diane Keaton), as well as reminiscing on his own WWII childhood in Cony Island and how it's molded him into the person he is today.This truly is one of Allen's most ambitious works from the 70's.  It molds together many different stylistic elements (split-screen, animation, directly addressing the camera, ""mental"" sub-titles), which is unusual for Allen.  His popularity over the years has been partly built on the construction of intricate worlds & relationships conveyed heavily through rapid dialogue, without an abundance of visual & musical elements to take in (with the exception of ""Manhattan"" and a couple of others).  What also makes Woody such a unique talent is that his films are so urban, the people in his work and the discoveries they experience do not regularly occur in Ohio or Texas.  That may make many corn-fed Americans understandably weary of the Woodman.  Many people also think they're seeing the same film over and over, Woody so often plays neurotic, Jewish New Yorkers whose occupation typically has literary or cinematic connotations, and the strengths of his films deal with adult relationships.  This all may be true theme-wise, but Woody rarely repeats himself.  He's always exploring different facets of the urban adult life.  Always very adult and very urban.The narrative strength of this film isn't as cohesive as other films partly because Allen jumps back and forth time-wise, detailing his childhood, women of his past, Annie's own adolescence, as well as Annie & Alvy's first meeting and their eventual split.  ""Annie Hall"" has been credited with being the chief influence on late 20th century romantic comedies, and it's influence is quite evident.  Even if some scenes seem out-of-place or too long, they have their moments.  Who doesn't love the scene in line at the movie theater that culminates with the classic statement ""Oh, if only life were like this!""  One reason why Woody's films are so easy to enjoy is because he presents his problems and complexities in a comfortable manner, you feel as if you're participating in his world instead of spying on it, he's always quick to let the audience in on the joke (for example, the sub-title sequence).  If you love Woody's vernacular, you could pretty much love anything Woody does.  ""Annie Hall"" is a great laugh.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love fades,"I must say this film is as ingenious as its director.I was fascinated by its novel way of telling a kinda dull story. We all live in a group of people and that is what we are:social animals.When dealing with a relationship with either a lover or a friend,people tend to get bored if they stick together all the time.I have to admit I am one of them,and I guess you are too.So,why do lovers and friends just give one another some private time and space.Some times I have to leave her alone and treat her completely like a stranger.But that sometimes does work ,as a Chinese old saying:Reunion after a short period of time apart is better than a brand new marriage!Always remember:Love fades.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Better Than Anticipated!,"Before viewing this movie, I saw that this film is a much-liked American classic and a Best Picture winner at the Oscars. I never seemed too interested in Woody Allen movies but after watching Annie Hall, I think I might just be interested. This film is a really good film with very witty dialogue and great lead acting.This film is about a stand-up comedian who falls out of a relationship with the girl he loves. Now he must piece together the facts on why their relationship ended.Woody Allen's character started annoying at first in my eyes but in the end, I grew on him. Diane Keation was very good in her role. Her performance was almost perfect. The two leads had very good chemistry between them.Overall, this is a borderline great movie that goes in-depth on relationship issues. There were times when I thought this film was a bit slow, but I could see the masterful techniques used in the making of this movie. I loved the fact that this film has very memorable lines and funny moments. I rate this film 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
How did he know?,"The first 7 or 8 times I saw and re-saw this masterpiece, I was amazed at how Allen saw
Into my soul and memory. How many of us have had those awkward first date moments with our inner dialogue making comments- and he puts them up as subtitles! Or taking a new date to the same place/situation that had worked so well with a previous woman only to have it fall flat on its face the second time around? There are so many moments in the film like this that I felt Allen had ESP. I just finished watching it again at age 69 after a 20-30 year unexplained hiatus and laughed- often with embarrassment- as much as in 1977.

Hilarious and genuinely moving; One of the best relationship movies ever.,"This has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time.This movie is about a neurotic New Yorker, Alvy Singer, who meets and falls in love with a quirky young lady named Annie Hall. The movie transcends mere film romance, though, and really attempts to analyze all the intricate layers of love, lust, passion, trust, and the lack thereof, that can make or break a relationship. By the end of the movie you really feel like you know these people, and that you just might have gained some new insights into how relationships might work. That is truly rare for a film.Woody Allen has a love for Manhattan and it shows. The movie is beautifully shot. Also notice how the LA scenes are shot to be saturated in bright, blown-out whites, while the Manhattan scenes are in richer, deeper, darker tones.If you are going through a breakup or otherwise have relationship problems, I especially recommend this movie. Seeing Alvy embark on all his weird, disastrous dates is sure to make you feel better.",,Anonymous,Romance
superb classic Woody Allen existential romantic comedy,"Woody Allen's dry comedic genius, existential observations and relationship witticisms make for one of the classics of 70s cinema. Annie Hall is much emulated, much copied and quoted and Diane Keaton in the titular role is her charming, quirky and bashful self. The chemistry between them is natural and seemingly genuine and it makes for a great film.Allen, playing Alvy Singer, a neurotic, hypochondriac, somewhat egocentric, stand-up comedian/writer, falls for Annie Hall (Keaton) when introduced at a tennis game, and their diverse characters make for ups and down of their relationship. The humour is intelligent and typical of Allen's self-effacing style, and often he engages the audience in straight to camera conversation. He narrates, as the style of the film is autobiographical, and some of the narration is told through flashbacks where up to date characters observe what went on in the past. It's a clever mix of styles, and the direction and script are sharp and tight. It's not aged particularly well but the wit of the dialogue, Allen's timeless narrative and comedic wisdom hasn't aged at all. His observations about relationships and people's behaviour is as true now as it was then. A true classic of cinema and I can't believe it's taken me this long to see it. Not disappointing. Look out for some very familiar faces... Christopher Walken, Colleen Dewhurst and Carol Kane.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Explores a comedian and his relationship with a girl,"I really enjoyed this movie, although I must say, I felt slightly disappointed. I think it is likely because the comedy community hypes Woody Allen to the point of unrealistic expectations. There were some instances of humor I didn't enjoy, certain one liners seemed somewhat dated and corny for example. However, there is another side to the movie's humor...Allen seems to write a kind of depressed nihilism into the character that I found amusing. It perfectly represents the personality of most comedians. A need to turn to jokes because of their miserable outlook. But there is a part of all of us that can relate to this.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Charming and Modern,"I believe it's a one of the best contemporary romantic-comedy and maybe the first. It's not a boring or monotone film, more innovative movie.

The Woody Allen blueprint for years to come. Funny and touching in spades.,"I absolutely loved this. Diane Keaton is quirky, and charming with a deep pool of a range of emotions and she is irresistible. A very deserving Best Actress (for Looking For Mr. Goodbar too I hear, still gotta catch it).I think, though, what makes this movie a classic is the story crafted by Woody Allen and Marshall Brickman. Its a New York point of view with Woody Allen's clever and humourous perspective on a wide variety of topics, including but not limited to being Jewish, the need for constant sex in a relationship, relationships in general, and never giving up on your dreams. And its all tied together with the main story when he was dating Annie Hall.It's mostly told in flashback and generally focuses on his serial dating and how most of the women in his life were either intellectually compatible or were insecure that they weren't smart enough to be with him. But it was his time with Annie Hall that captured his heart and the memories that he's most fond of.Its full of little tributes to Woody Allen's idols and favorite movies, including several hilarious nods to The Sorrow and the Pity. It's masterfully directed with unique camera shots and tricks, including a literal out of body experience, and subtitles for a character's thoughts.It's very funny, charming, smart, and full of life. Well rewarded and is a joy to watch from start to finish. The acting is very high rate. And don't forget it has tons of future stars in very brief cameos. Check out the cast list to see.If you don't care for Woody Allen and his movies I get it, but if you are ever curious, this one should be the pick of the litter.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Smug and condescending - which is of course the joke,"A movie directed by Woody Allen, who's also playing the lead role. A movie about a neurotic New York comedian, who recalls us with tales about his dating history, while constantly complaining about how hard it is to hold a girl when you're an egotistical, backboneless loser with a misogynistic streak a mile wide. And that's the only joke this film has. The only one.To be fair, there's more to this movie than its humour. Allen has stated that the film is not meant to be autobiographical, but that's a bit hard to swallow watching the film. It's constantly talking about New York, holocaust movies, being a Jew in modern America, death literature, psychoanalysis and every single other thing that you can pin on Allen.And throughout this all Singer (Allen) and his dysfunctional relationships are under the microscope. To the film's credit it doesn't try to portray Singer as a hero. The character himself thinks that he's simply misunderstood and not to blame, but the actual film makes it more than clear that the culprit in Singer's case can be found by looking into a mirror. Except when it doesn't. Because there are scenes that shift the blame on society and its way of making people unable to form lasting relationships. Meaning that the film is essentially saying, ""Sorry, Singer, but you cannot get the girl because you're an awful person. But it's not your fault, not really. You had no chance of being anything but an awful person."" And I don't like that the film is contradicting itself like this.It also doesn't help that I don't really like Woody Allen films in general. They're simply too snobbish and smug for me. If this movie, for example, was a person, it would be a rail thin wannabe artist, who would look down his nose at you unless you could talk with them about the emptiness of human soul caused by the modern information age in relation to Marxist theory as fulfilled in post-war Africa.This movie has its fan, as has Woody Allen in general, but I can only hope that I don't wake up one day and find myself having become one.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Wonderfully Quirky Romance,"Annie Hall is one of the best movies Woody Allen has done. It's witty, intelligent, realistic, beautiful, touching, and unique. It toys with our concept of time, as we see a relationship and the beginning, middle, and end of it, not always in this order.The screenplay, as in all Woody movies, is great. The romance always sounds so real- with its bad and good times, and no forced happy ending- that you root for them to stay together. The characters are amazing. Annie Hall is wonderfully developed. She's truly beautiful, sweet, humane and quite odd, which makes her endearing. Woody Allen is just himself, nervous and paranoid. The jokes are always thought provoking and incredibly witty and ironic. The dialogs are about as good as you can get; not just they keep you interested, but they're full of references to another movies and books and have a lot of criticism to our society and ourselves. The way the story is told gets you even more interested, with all the flashbacks giving you insight in who the characters were and who they become.The acting is stunning. Diane Keaton, as Annie, gives one of my favorite performances ever. Her character is well written, but it's quite difficult to pull off. She can just get the right quirky, messy look,. with a lot of sweetness and beauty. She has an amazing delivery, speaking about everything in a light, cute way. The supporting actors are all good, but no one can get close to Keaton. Woody Allen, even if just playing himself, is particularly good.The direction is one of the best Allen has done, with the hand held camera and his way of starring at the camera and saying what he thinks or wishes. The editing makes the movie much more interesting; it runs smoothly an it's easy to understand, and at the same time it helps you to get a full understanding of the relationship. The music and photography are good, but not remarkable. Overall, this is an obligatory movie for everyone, and what every romantic comedy wishes to be.",,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant,"Probably the best romantic comedy you'll ever see. Woody Allen plays Alvy Singer, an insecure, cerebral comedian living in Manhattan (hmm), who is trying to understand how his relationship with Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) ended. The script is fantastic, and Allen gives us a steady stream of jokes ranging from subtle, intellectual references to physical comedy, and while I only laughed out loud a few times, I was often smiling. He also uses a variety of creative techniques in this film - speaking directly to the camera, stepping directly into childhood memories, giving voice to inner thoughts, and including a brief animation, among other things. He explores love, sex, and relationships, but also the cultural differences between Jews and Gentiles, and New Yorkers and Californians in clever ways. His understated facial reaction as Keaton orders Pastrami on white bread with lettuce and tomatoes is priceless.The film is sweet, endearing, and sentimental about relationships, and yet it's also balanced, showing the bittersweet pitfalls with just the right touches, including a brilliant ending. On top of all that, it's great to see Paul Simon in a couple of scenes, Allen's references to the 1969 documentary ""The Sorrow and the Pity"", and Diane Keaton's wonderful performance of ""Seems Like Old Times"". Great film, and very worthy of the Academy Awards it won.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Annie Hall Review,"I don't necessarily remember ever watching a Woody Allen film. I've heard him here and there from my parents but I don't think I knew who he was. For the first film I've watched him in, it was actually quite well done.The dialogue was especially the most enjoyable. I'm a fan of witty dialogue and a lot of movies can't pull it off as well as Woody Allen did. His character is hilariously awkward and almost ironic since someone like him could be anything but a catch. The women he's seen with are all 9's and 10's, yet they end up with a balding skinny guy with glasses. The whole thing seems kind of funny to me. Yet even with that funny dynamic I found it actually quite realistic since it stuck closer to real life and how life changes at the drop of a hat, rather than following a storyline. I think the haphazardness of it all was what made it a good movie.The photography was very pretty as well, but I didn't find it as interesting in my opinion. It focused more on the characters and less on how it actually looked and portrayed certain environments. The camera angles were there and sometimes showing them in certain areas that are purposefully blocked out by the camera (like when Annie and him were talking in the bedroom together, etc.), but most of the time was spent on fleshing out and retelling a flashback of Woody's character.8/10 for an overall good performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The camera work in this film, portraying the true grit and raw beauty of New York City, and the beautiful sunset on the beach.

An indispensable masterpiece.,"""Annie Hall"" is an indispensable masterpiece. I highly recommend this movie to those people who have ever had an intimate relationship, that is to say, almost everybody.In this movie Woody Allen analyzes the eternal amorous problem between men and women explaining the ""ins and outs"" of personal relationships, all that with the best sense of humor of this New Yorker genie. However incredible it seems ""Annie Hall"" is not a comedy but a drama. This drama deals with the irrational ans incomprehensive world of relationships and how necessary it is for all of us.To make this movie Allen uses different formal resources such ""a voice off"" to express the thoughts of the characters and all this is connected with a brilliant script that makes this movie very amusing.In conclusion ""Annie Hall"" is one of Woody Allen's most important movies in the last 25 years.",,Anonymous,Romance
One-Line Review: Annie Hall (8 Stars),"I am simply impressed by the witty and sometimes funny dialogues made by Woody Allen's character and his co-characters that make up Annie Hall that I don't want to stress more about anything else, be it the electric and effortless performances, the fourth wall, the 1970s Brooklyn, NY, or even the idea where he breaks down the complex relationship between two persons into a simplified statement at the climax.

A masterpiece of sentimental urban comedy,"A New York comedian and a Midwestern girl have a brief Summer affair.Living proof that the best films are about nothing, this won the Oscar awards for picture (the only time this has been given to a comedy), script and direction. Maybe modesty prevented the Academy from giving Allen the award for best actor too - although he was nominated. Co-star Diane Keaton won the Best Actress award largely on the strength of the material.The world-class wisecracks of Allen make the thing worthwhile by themselves (""don't knock masturbation it is sex with someone I love"") and the fact that Allen (the director) feels he can do anything from subtitles (giving his secret thoughts) to going back in time to revisit his own childhood. He is like a stage magician, we sit not knowing what tricks he is going to pull next, applauding because his tricks are not only a surprise, but often fantastic too.To complicate the matters even more, Allen and Keaton once had a brief affair (which ended before filming started) and we are left wondering if some of the scenes are not autobiographical. It all seems to make the soup that bit thicker and spicier.Like Dickens, Lennon and Shakespeare, Allen is an author visited by genius in being able to make the everyday and mundane in to something epic. I can't explain it (certainly not in a paragraph or two), but I am glad it is there. There is 93 minutes of film in Annie Hall, but there isn't one moment of boredom or scene that falls flat.When you pair this with Manhattan (a companion piece to this) you have Woody Allen at the peak of his film making powers, producing material that people will be enjoying a hundred years from now. The real tragedy is that so few films are this good and the present day Allen has passed his peak; but I live in hope that I see another comedy that delivers as many down-to-earth laughs and insights in my lifetime.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The kind of movie that makes you feel smarter after you watch it.,"Before Annie Hall, I had only seen the more recent Woody Allen movies. Vicky Cristina Barcelona (very good), Match Point (good), and Scoop (awful). Needless to say Annie Hall was a bit of a shock. It was was very different from those later Allen films.I love how Woody is unafraid to throw any and everything at the viewer. Any story-telling device or technique that he wants to use, he just goes for it. Talking directly to the audience, flashbacks, asides, they all combine to tell the story of a relationship - piece by piece. This isn't a straightforward narrative, and it's a better movie as a result. Every time I thought things were beginning to bog down a little, some awesome joke or interesting narrative flourish would come out of nowhere and jolt my interest back into what was going on. That's how you make a relationship movie interesting for those who typically avoid these kinds of flicks.Take all those complimentary things I've just said and wrap them in the kind of bittersweet, memorable ending that I love, and you have Annie Hall in a nutshell. I never really appreciated how smart Woody is, before i watched this. It's funny and intelligent and full of the kind of references and jokes that makes me wish I could write this kind of thing. Great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

All they do is give out awards!,"IMDb Top 250: 136I am unqualified to write this review.I'll elaborate. This is my first Woody Allen film. Film starts. Title. Credits on a black background, no effects. No music. And then Woody, talking directly to us about him, with a rich, varied and intellectual use of the English language. Like a great book, Annie Hall demands your full focus to analyze and understand just what is being said. Recently the thought that I want to be a writer has popped into my head, and no one does writing, directing and acting better than Woody Allen.Annie Hall is about the relationship between cynical Alvy and ditzy Annie. While the film is a rom-com, it's more of a rom-com*. The * is because it's darkly funny, and the level of romance goes up and down like a roller-coaster. It's very honest, there's no closed doors in our viewing of the relationship.Annie Hall came very close to getting the Oscar Big 5, only losing the Best Actor, and while I haven't seen the winner, it must've been a good contest. Of the 3 films to achieve this, I think Annie Hall would be the most deserving. Allen and Keaton are believable and lovable. Allen's directing is superb, with tricks I was floored by. As said before, the writing is rich and so... complete, all coming together in a grand package. Also funny to note, the quote I used, Alvy's description of LA, is ironically fitting to the film it's from.Several things are worth noting. The 4th wall is broken, a lot and it's perfect. How many movies do you wish the main character would just stop and tell you what he's thinking? My favourite example is the movie theater line, where Alvy verbally dismantles the man behind him in line, even making one of the topics appear (it's fantasy). Other fantasies include Alvy asking random people on the street what happened to his romance. I personally love his references to all kinds of things, even if I didn't get some of them: I do that myself. Lastly, one scene has subtitles, and I had to shake my head and rewind. It was brilliant.Lastly, the setting. Annie Hall is a New York film, except when they stop in LA twice. Alvy Singer is a New York guy, and he feels very uncomfortable in such a foreign place. Only after did I realize what a great job the film does of making New York feel like home. The scenes in LA were UNBEARABLE. I haven't loved hating something so much.Annie Hall was surprisingly good, and far smarter than I expected. An all-around AAA film that is relatable, comforting and charming, all in 90 minutes. 9.2/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of Allen's Finest,"This one is a must for serious Woody Allen fans. Those wanting to explore a new genre or trying to find out why Allen is hailed as a genius filmmaker shouldn't miss Annie Hall either.Annie Hall is set in New York and Los Angeles in the mid-70s. The story is about Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). The relationship between the two protagonists is the crux of the movie. In between, we are given snippets of their lives before they met each other. Alvy Singer, a comedian, with two divorces runs into Annie Hall, a budding actress-singer, during a friendly game of tennis. They start dating and have a passionate affair, only to find out later that they have little in common. An amiable split, getting back together, being friends, trying to get back together; theirs is a see-saw relationship of two neurotic characters clashing with one another.In true Woody Allen fashion, the characters are far from normal. Alvy Singer is perpetually nervous (a trait he attributes to growing up under a roller-coaster), while Annie Hall needs to smoke grass to enjoy sex. Throughout the film, Woody Allen, through his character, talks to us, the audience, and on a couple of occasions brings in someone else from the plot to talk to us as well.The central genre of the movie is comedy. With Woody Allen at its helm, one can expect goofy sequences and numerous one-liners. Woody Allen's comic one-liners have achieved cult status and here are a few one-liners from the film: Annie Hall saying, ""I can't have sex tonight. I'm singing tomorrow and need to rest my voice."" Alvy Singer saying, ""Don't knock masturbation, its sex with someone I really love."" And, ""Sex is the most fun I've had without laughing."" And, on Beverly Hills being clean, ""They don't throw their garbage away, they make it into TV shows."" And that's just a sampler.Annie Hall was released in 1977 and is one of Allen's most loved and appreciated movie. At the 1977 Oscars, it won numerous awards like Best Picture, Best Actress in a Leading Role, Best Director and Best Screenplay. Woody Allen was also nominated for the Best Actor award.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I've been wanting to see this for a while, the first Woody Allen picture I ever saw was Blue Jasmine and I loved that film, granted its nothing like Annie Hall but it was a great character study. Annie Hall was also a best picture winner so that also made me more excited when I put the Bluray in. Annie Hall contains more intellectual wit and cultural references than any other movie to win an Oscar for best picture, and in winning the award in 1978 it edged out Star Wars, an outcome unthinkable today. The victory marked the beginning of Woody Allen's career as an important filmmaker(his work was funny but slight) and it signaled the end of the 1970s golden age of movies. Annie Hall is built on such dialogue and centers on conversation and monologue. Because it is just about everyone's favorite Woody Allen movie, because it won the Oscar, because it is a romantic comedy few viewers probably notice how much of it consist of people talking, simply talking. This is a movie that establishes its tone by constantly switching between tones: The switches reflect the restless mind of the filmmaker, turning away from the apparent subject of a scene to find the angle that reveals the joke. Annie Hall is a movie about a man who is always looking for the loopholes in perfection. Who can turn everything into a joke, and wishes he couldn't. I give Annie Hall a five out of five",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Woody Allen favorite comedian,"Woody Allen is one of my favorite comedians, so pretty much anything he does or is in I really enjoy. But I remember watching Annie Hall with my dad when I was younger and laughing pretty hard at some of it. The great thing about Annie Hall with Diane Keaton, who is also a really great actor, and her and Woody Allen play great off each other, is that this movie broke the invisibility gap in films that no other films have ever tried before. For example in the very beginning we see Woody Allen talking directly to the camera as if he is talking to us, the audience. Where he also says one of my favorite lines from Charlie Chapman, "" I wouldn't want to be part of any club that would have me as a member."" Which is kind of like Woody Allen's motto in life. Another example is that they used two different split screen shots in the film, Allen added subtitles in the movie at one point, and he even had a cartoon version of himself in the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"One of the great films.  Timeless, hysterical, and universally human","Just to add my voice to the choir: Quite simply one of the best films about romantic relationships ever made. Brilliantly written. Brilliantly acted -- Diane Keaton is tremendous, the supporting cast is full of gems and Allen himself takes the leap to present himself as a real (if funny) human being and not a walking joke. And brilliantly photographed by the great Gordon Willis of 'The Godfather' and many of most important films of the 70s and 80s.Wildly funny and ultimately heartbreaking. It's hard to imagine anyone who has ever been in love, or struggled through grown-up relationships NOT identifying with a lot of this film. I loved it in my late teens when it first came out, and I love it even more 32 years later. Every time I see it I notice different details, depending on my own current life experiences. A film of enormous wit, humor, invention, and understanding of the human heart. Its completely unique, playful and idiosyncratic in style and approach, but that experimentation somehow only makes it more accessible and universal. If you haven't seen it, you owe yourself a try, even if you're not a Woody Allen 'fan'. And if you saw it long ago, it may be time for another look.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A nervous romance 9/10,"""Annie Hall"" is a fantastic romance movie directed by Woody Allen. And written by Woody Allen and Marshall Brickman. A movie that depicts the challenges and difficulties in a relationship between two people who are completely different. Woody Allen's character Alvy Singer is an intelligent and sarcastic man while Diane Keaton's character Annie Hall is more independent and open minded. Allen's massage in the film is how relationships are complicated but after all we need them just like we need everything else. The features Woody Allen uses in this film are creative and what make this film phenomenal: breaking the fourth wall, showing subtitles as the thoughts of the characters in a dialogue, animation scenes, the screen being cut off and showing moments of the past while the characters from the present are absorbing. So the list goes on. What Allen mostly jokes about is the stupidity of people around him and how people can be ironic and uncultured. Woody Allen's performance is wonderful, funny, sarcastic and deserves appreciation. Diane Keaton's performance is amazing and beautiful. Overall, ""Annie Hall"" is a perfect example of how a relationship can have some happy moments and difficult moments as well. How it can be irrational and unnecessary, have some advantages and disadvantages at the same time. But after all we as humans need relationships in our lives, just like we need eggs.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Truly boring,There's something about Woody Allen that just makes my brain switch off. Perhaps his sense of humour appeals to others but for me it just falls flat. His protagonists are all just clones of himself and the plots of his films feel almost like therapeutic fantasies where he gets to process his own insecurities at the audience's expense. I find nothing redeeming in his films.,3.0,Anonymous,Romance
I was glad when this was over,"I guess I'm not the type who likes Woody Allen films. While I loved 'Don't Drink the Water' and I liked 'The Sunshine Boys', I found 'Scenes from a Mall' to be a disappointment. I don't remember exactly how I felt about 'Crimes and Misdemeanors' and 'Alice', but I don't recall liking either one a lot.So my expectations were not that high for this movie. I really enjoyed the surreal scenes, such as when the adult Alvy appeared in the classroom where he was a child, especially when the kids started saying some very adult things. The scene with the wicked queen from 'Snow White' was great and, if it was new animation, rather than just inserting characters into the old, it was perfect. I liked some of Alvy's jokes, but by no means all. And while some of the humor may have been cutting edge way back then, it's not my taste and I've heard it too many times before. I like old corny jokes told well.I'm sure Diane Keaton did a good job. Annie Hall just didn't appeal to me as a character, and she wasn't that pretty, though I liked her hair and she had a nice smile. I liked the outfit that included the tie her grandmother gave her.It surprised me that Alvy left a party to watch a Knicks game. I just don't think of Woody Allen, or his characters, as sports fans. I don't like sports myself.I was confused several times because Alvy seemed to know Annie well at first, then it was like they had just met in some later scenes, and this was never explained.Something I found curious, which indicates there could be strong language here: the TV station included a stern warning about adult content because this was not edited. And yet the sound went out a couple of times. I don't know what I didn't hear, but I suspect it was bad.I'm not saying I can't like this kind of humor. It's just that this wasn't my kind of movie.",,Anonymous,Romance
Happiness in a doomed relationship,"I'm going to have to do a Woody Allen run at some point, and one of the things that I'll be most interested in discovering is the influence of Ingmar Bergman on his work. I think this is one of the earliest works of his with those influences front and center (there are two posters for Bergman films, Face to Face and The Passion of Anna, while the two main characters arriving late for Face to Face is a small plot point for a scene), and there is a lot of talk from the main character about his concerns about death. It's obvious that already Allen was influenced, but I don't know how much it shows up in Love and Death (seems like a safe assumption). I'd also be interested in his swerve from purely comedic films like Bananas and Sleeper to something with a more serious core to it like this. For this is often very funny, but there's a level of pathos here that's obviously missing from a lot of his earlier work.Alvy (Allen) is a man reaching his forties and dealing with the end of his third major relationship of his life, that with the titular Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). Alvy is a product of a Jewish family from Brooklyn who lived underneath a roller coaster at Coney Island, according to his active memory, and he's riddled with worries and neuroses. Told in a largely chronological order with some bits of time jumping (the film was reportedly heavily reworked in editing reminding me of the end results of Tom Jones but with a surer hand on the actual production to help smooth over the more jarring edits), it's a reflective tale, told from Alvy's perspective at the end of the relationship, about how this perfect situation for him fell apart over time.After his first two marriages, he's open to something new and meets Annie while playing tennis with his best friend Rob (Tony Roberts), and they immediately hit it off in their own awkward way despite their obvious differences. He's born and bred from New York, but she's from Wisconsin. He's highly educated, but she's not. He understands the language of the intelligentsia (though largely uses it to hide his own demerits and insecurities, especially in one of the film's funniest moments when the two are speaking on her terrace and we get subtitles explaining what they are actually saying when they speak), and she is just curious about the world. He ends up encouraging her to pursue her artistic endeavors, mostly her singing, and she encourages him after his comedy shows. They're a healthy couple, as much as can be, but there are barrier between them that one or the other or both can never quite bridge.The biggest is probably the one about drugs. Alvy isn't a prude about it, but it bothers him that Annie can't make love without first toking on some weed. She becomes disengaged in their lovemaking when she can't do it. He pushes her into education and therapy, and that gives her a greater vocabulary to fight him back with intellectually that he no longer appreciates. He says he wants the smarter girl, but the smarter girl on his own wavelength is what he had before (mostly his second wife) who can knock him back which, considering his nebbish nature and small stature, is an obvious sore spot for him.There's a break. There's a reconnection. There's an effort to go out to Los Angeles for Alvy's own career, and the position ends up appealing more to Annie than to Alvy, all while their second relationship is on their lowest points.The undercurrent of the whole thing is Alvy's obsession with death, exemplified by the books he buys for Annie or his recurring need to watch The Sorrow and the Pity, as well as his self-conscious Jewishness that he can never quite rid himself of. So, going to see Annie's family and getting suspicious stares from her grandmother (including a great moment where he's subjectively shown as a Hassidic Jew) Alvy is part of a situation where he's out of place, even in the middle of where Annie is from. There are differences between them that end up consuming him and her and driving them apart even though their happiest moments are very happy indeed.Is it a relationship that could have worked out if they had tried harder? Maybe. Should it have? Maybe not. Was the ending of the relationship the good thing even though it was painful? Very possibly, and that's the sad thing. They were very happy at times, but ultimately they weren't right for each other.It's a perceptive little film based on his own experiences with women, including Keaton, and Allen manifests it with his own very funny sense of comedy that still tickles and even touches decades later. It's an accomplished move into something more serious by a comic who was being consumed by larger questions while also finding the great bits of comedy in life, like the brief scene with Christopher Walken as Annie's brother who talks to Alvy about having a desire to drive into oncoming traffic immediately followed by him driving Alvy and Annie at night. It's got great comic timing while keeping Alvy and Annie at the center of it all.I really do find so much to love in this film, and I have no real complaints about it. It's pretty obviously cut down from something larger (there's one long shot that's all voice over that's mean to blend two scenes along with a host of smaller example), but the stitches are far less obvious or jarring than in Tom Jones. I think this is a testament to Allen's more reserved approach to his camera placements, choosing to film things cleanly and flatly, more like a Bergman than anyone else, all while what became his central plot, which was no more than a subplot in his original script, takes center stage, having been written completely enough to be able to stand on its own.I really don't mind that this won Best Picture. I probably would have still voted for Star Wars, though.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sometimes having a Woody is heaven,"This film is still the only COMEDY to ever win a BEST PICTURE Oscar. So in that light it is unique.But obviously what makes it unique is that it is touching, warm, gentle and a genuine comedy masterpiece.Woody Allen is one of Hollywood's most prolific talents. His first stroke of genius was Sleeper. But those who followed his career from TV writer to stand-up to actor to director will acknowledge that for all Woody's shortcomings, he is still a brilliant talent.W.A. has said on more than one occasion that Bob Hope was his inspiration when it came to comedy. This makes sense since both men are legends in entertainment.Woody's best work happened in the 70's. He's made some wonderful films (Everyone Says I Love You) since then.

Classic? I think not.,"Back in 1977 Star Wars was conquering the entire world. Amassing box office numbers never before even imagined, Star Wars was truly becoming a massive part of American culture very, very quickly. With brilliant writing, casting, direction, and also a good dose of fun, Star Wars is hands-down one of the top movies of all time. It was expected to sweep the Oscars that year. But, the film would be overshadowed at the Oscars by the quiet film Annie Hall. Annie Hall put Woody Allen on the map and made him a star. The film would also launch the career of Diane Keaton. Using a very unique form of storytelling that would become perfected by Quinten Tarantino, Annie Hall is totally not the average love story, for many many reasons.But, just because of it being a different kind of film, it does not make it any more entertaining. Annie Hall is charming, it does have a few laughs, but it is nowhere near the greatest film of all time. It is not worthy of the Best Picture Oscar, nor is it worthy of being listed as a true classic. Instead, the film should just be accepted as one of the more groundbreaking filming achievements of the 1970s, and nothing more. Woody Allen's one-joke film (the entire film focuses around the bizarre personality of the main character) clocks in at a decent amount of time and offers a realistic bittersweet ending, but seems to lack that punch that truly makes it a standout film.The story revolves around a very nervous and neurotic comedian by the name of Alvy Singer who falls in love with this interesting and pretty singer Annie Hall. Throughout the film, you see the ups and downs of the relationships, and also get glimpses into the pasts of both people in order to get an idea as to why they are the way they are, and why they have so much chemistry together. The best part of this movie is the chemistry Allen and Keaton have. When they are together, you can sense the love and care thy have for each other. Both performances were excellent; they truly were the ones carrying the film. Everyone else in the film really carried no weight and are totally forgettable characters, besides Christopher Walken's character, which shared a very funny moment with Woody Allen.Annie Hall denies the fact that there is a fourth wall, as the film has the main character talking to the audience. This is not the only bizarre element of the film. The movie has many things that prior to being released, had not been witnessed before, which included the thoughts of two people talking to each other as they engaged in conversation, also has tons of flashbacks and moments in which the main characters interact with their past counterparts. All these little unique moments throughout the movie make this movie very fresh, very different from the average romantic comedy. While these little things do enhance the experience a little, it fails to save the movie from at times being a bit boring or a bit tedious. There is just way too much time in between laughs.The humor is at times a bit dry, which could be another reason why it appealed to so many but did not appeal much to me. I personally thought Napoleon Dynamite was the worst comedy within the past three decades. Annie Hall is no Napoleon Dynamite mind you, but it still lacks that edge that the better romantic comedies contain, comedies like The 40-year-Old Virgin, When Harry Met Sally, Pretty Woman, and There's Something About Mary.Bottom Line: Annie Hall is not worthy of having that Best Picture Oscar; it should have gone to Star Wars for sure. I have never found Woody Allen that funny, and I did not really see what was the big deal about this film. It is just an average, mediocre love story told in a very unique way. While paving the way for interesting movie making from Robert Rodriguez, Quinten Tarantino, and others, Annie Hall is an experimental film that appeals to some, while failing to appeal to others. This is not the romantic comedy classic that everyone makes it out to be. Annie Hall: superb performances barred by many slow and dull moments and boring situations, not a classic in my standards.Score: 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"anti-semitism, Freud, direct camera scenes etc.. different but not great","I am not surprised to learn that Marshall Brickman--the co-writer of the script suggested the title ""It Had to Be Jew"" to the movie. I found Allen's anti-semitism references obsessive and unnecessary. It is not just that anti-semitism references.If you do not know much about Freud the comedy may not make much sense for you. You should know something about the concepts like ""latency period"", ""penis envy"", ""polymorphously perverse"" etc... When you try to create a comedy about love I guess you do not have to make pointed references to sex all the time either.I sort of liked the techniques used in the film but they don't necessarily make sense. For instance, Allen's character, standing in a cinema queue with Annie Hall and listening to someone behind leaves the line to speak to the camera directly. The man comes to speak to the camera in his defense, and Alvy Singer/Woody Allen resolves the dispute by pulling McLuhan himself from behind a counter to tell the man that his interpretation is wrong.In another scene also when Allen is at a dinner with the family of Annie Hall he just starts talking about the family to the camera directly...ALL IN ALL I SORT OF LIKED BUT IT IS NOt A GREATEST MOVIE AT ALL...",,Anonymous,Romance
One of the greatest romantic comedies of all time.,"It seems somewhat insulting to describe 'Annie Hall' as a romantic comedy, simply because of what that genre implies. However, that's exactly what it is – one of the most intelligent, heart-warming and realistically raw romantic comedies of all time. It's consistently hilarious, it dissects the complexities and peculiarities of love apart so perfectly and the two lead characters are just magnificent. To call 'Annie Hall' timeless would be a complete understatement. It more than stands its ground against any of the cliché-ridden, populist garbage that passes for romance in Hollywood these days, simply by being so human.What makes 'Annie Hall' so great is that it doesn't insult the intelligence of its audience or try to pretend that everything in the World is all chocolates and roses. The lead character, Alvy Singer (Woody Allen, in without a doubt his best role) is a condescending, neurotic, paranoid, spiteful, jealous little man who is wholly unable to make any sacrifices in his life or face up to change and progress. He's also sweet, charming, quaint, hilarious and thoroughly likable because in Alvy Singer is a little bit of everybody who's ever fallen in love and found themselves unable to move on. Annie (Diane Keaton) is the original 'girl next door'. She's committed, she's kind, she's generous, a bit kooky and – despite everything Alvy does to stop her from breaking free and becoming her own woman – she cares about him deeply. Their relationship is absolutely mesmerising and the chemistry between Allen and Keaton is simply perfect. It's impossible not to become invested in these characters because they are so well-written, so well- performed and so believable that the film's surrealism seems distinctly normal. On a number of occasions, the characters break the fourth wall and address the audience directly. After a while, you almost stop noticing that it's even happening because you're so involved in these characters' lives. The many creative techniques Allen utilises – from animation, to split-screen, mental subtitles and a cameo by Marshall McLuhan that left me in tears of laughter – keep the film current and fresh and were, for their time, highly innovative. The supporting characters, too, are brilliant little pastiches of real-life people that help the film flow so naturally. Seriously, I cannot heap enough praise on this film, it's just utterly wonderful.However, even without all of that, Annie Hall would still be a pretty decent film because it's just so funny. It's one of Allen's best ever scripts and some of the interactions between the characters are hilarious. Unlike the countless attempts to rip it off, the humour in Annie Hall is subtle and intelligent. There's no pleasuring oneself with a pie or defecating in a sink here. It's just pure class and pure wit from start to finish. Similarly, the film isn't afraid to shock. Allen's analysis of the culture of both anti-Semitism and his beloved New York City is razor-sharp and some of the one-liners are hysterical (watch out for the joke about Alvy's grandma and the Cossacks, as an example). But ultimately, what makes 'Annie Hall' so great is that it is consistently bittersweet. We love Alvy, we love Annie and we love them both together. They're made for each other. Except, when push comes to shove, everybody knows, deep down in their hearts, that their relationship can never work. Allen's never been one for saccharine resolutions and 'Annie Hall' is no exception. It's the type of film you can watch again and again and again and never get bored because there's a little bit of Alvy and a little bit of Annie in every single one of us and the humour is so subtle that you're guaranteed to spot something new - a facial expression, a quirky little bit of cinematography or a killer one-liner - every single time.If you think a film such as 'American Pie' or 'Superbad' is the best comedy ever made then perhaps Annie Hall won't be for you (though funnily enough, I think both of those films are reasonably enjoyable, so I don't want to generalise too much here) but if you're looking for a film that can explore love, loss, friendship, family and that sense of emptiness we all feel now and then, whilst also making you wet yourself laughing, then you can't go far wrong with this film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfect ending,"Yes, it's clever, it's funny, it's touching . . . But isn't the ending just plain great? I'll avoid spoiling it for whoever hasn't seen it yet, but I've always felt that Annie Hall's ending was a big reason why it stands out as one of Woody Allen's masterpieces and my favorite of his films.By the way, to those wondering about the original murder mystery that gave birth to Annie Hall, I guess the closest thing to it you can get is Manhattan Murder Mystery.

As heavy as it is light,"Merging those two ill-fated styles of comedic wit and sincere bite as seamlessly as any legendary comedy would, Allen's Annie Hall is every bit deserving of it's towering stature and as one of the high points in his brilliant career. Delivering scene after scene of convincing, multi-layered, and hilarious insight into our tragic hero's neurotic mind via a series of failed relationships, the analysis of the title role post, pre and during our negative one's crazed narration guides the viewer through an intensely enjoyable romantic comedy that is as unique and genuine as it is funny and tender. The blistering script will hardly ever loose relevance (except for those that just refuse to ever enjoy Allen's style) and the two lead performances are very real, accentuating the fast pace. In such a great career, it is still small wonder why this one will always be up there on lists with Woody, although the fierce originality he brought to the table that shines so brightly in this movie, eventually became his Achilles heel when that originality stopped being so original, and later altogether abandoned to an apathetic new generation. Hopefully his last rebirth of popularity via Scarlett will actually let him do what he does best on screen in this new one with her, albeit with much less force and gripping psychological relevance then the good old days used to provide.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

So Neurotic; So Glorious.,"I never would have expected to like Woody Allen. There is just something about his nasally voice that sets the expectation of boredom. When watching Annie Hall for the first time I wasn't really sure what to expect. I knew this was a film about a man and a woman and I knew it was set in New York City, though beyond that I assumed I was either about to watch an hour and a half of neurosis or an existential art film. It turns out I was right. What I was wrong about is how much I enjoyed it. There are so many unconventional storytelling methods used here. Despite many of them now considered being trite, breaking the fourth wall, they all feel original in this 1977 classic.The general plot of Annie Hall wasn't particularly interesting, but the characters created and the conversations are strong enough to make the story feel fresh and clever. There are plenty of gags here that turn this romantic comedy into a film that will make you forget you're watching a romantic comedy. In a traditional sense of course since modern romantic comedies have soured the term.Annie Hall has opened the door to Woody Allen for me. I'm not sure if I'll like anything I find inside, but what I do know is that I'm interested to see what else I can find from a director that I've ignored for far too long.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The best of Allen,"It's beyond discussion that this is Woody Allen's masterpiece. It's so identical to aaaall of his movies, yet it takes all the distinctive marks to a higher level. The classical Woody Allen playing as himself, the lovely Diane Keaton being a mess, New York, intellectual parties with pretentious conversations, hilarious dialogues that mix Jew jokes with literary references; not to mention the beautiful cinematography, the sudden scene changes and the kind of intemporality in which the movie takes us into. There's no cohesive plot line, it's a bunch of scenes put together without before or after, exactly the way memory works. Exactly the way one thinks of a relationship during a break up: just individual pieces that somehow tie together, beautiful, lovely, unreal memories. So unreal that in Singer's memory it makes perfect sense that he starts talking about Annie to passers-by, or that he breaks the fourth wall and starts talking to us the public, or that Annie's family can have a conversation with Singer's family at different moments and places.Annie Hall is the ultimate break up movie. Forget 500 Days of summer, The Notebook, or anything that came after 1977. They stand as ridiculously fake, Hollywoodesque, cheesy. This movie does not have any pretensions of rightfully portraying reality, but in its crazy and surreal way it is far more loyal to the mood of somebody who is going through a break-up.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Allen's shtick has seriously palled,"Here's the thing about Woody Allen movies in the Seventies. They were so funny back then in large part because they were so different from all other movies. But thirty-five or so years down the road, Allen's shtick, the neurotic, New York, nerdy, Jewish angst has seriously palled. And so have his movies. Including those from back in the day. ""Annie Hall"" was fresh and different in 1977. But it is old hat in 2015 and no longer very good, or very funny. Seeing this again now, it is hard to believe how much I liked it back then. There are still some good things about it, some of the framing of some shots, the violation of the fourth wall, and so on, that still stand out. But overall, blah.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Allen's Strange Love, or How I Learned to Stop Whining and Love the Film ...","You know this awkward and uncomfortable feeling when you just finished a joke and yet everyone looks like waiting for the punch line, inviting for a humiliating ""That's it"" that tolls the bell of a benign but painful failure? Well, my worst memory comes from a joke that I swore I would never speak about again, but let's exorcise the inner demons behind the mask of anonymity. There's a guy who comes to his friend and tells him ""I have two news for you"" His friend says ""Well, start with the bad news"" to which the other replies: ""They're both bad news""This summarizes the first feeling I had with Woody Allen's most acclaimed and praised film, ""Annie Hall"", the movie still famous, or infamous, depends on the POV, for having beaten the much more spectacular, groundbreaking and popular ""Star Wars"" in the Best Picture Oscar competition.I was not the Woody Allen fan I happen to be now; I was totally unfamiliar with his 80's and 90's work and probably more compliment-oriented towards his slapstick period. I expected from ""Annie Hall"" a romantic comedy between the eternally neurotic Woody character and a sort of hip and free-spirited woman played by Diane Keaton and named Annie Hall. Well, I wasn't disappointed on that level, but while I wanted to see a movie really worthy of a Best Picture Oscar, something that would provide a nice mix of wit and emotions, I could only see a pretentious ego-centered movie with no point, no structure, no appeal, the movie left me with a very flat feeling, and God knows how I've always hated flatness. So indeed, 'they were both bad news.'But I guess I was victim of the 'Illusory Time' concept. You know what the illusory time concept is? It's this revolutionary idea that time doesn't exist, not quite the way we interpret it as a reality conditioned by the existence of a past, a present, a future but more the combination of the three into one perpetual present. This theory relies on the universe's inner property: its expansion. And while you can define a point on Earth by three spatial and one temporal coordinates, if you take a more universal approach, you realize that the three spatial dimensions will never be static considering the expansion of the universe. In other words, we're never in the same point. This doesn't really make me feel as anxious as young Alvy Singer, but this explains why I disliked Allen's ""Annie Hall"".When you take ""Annie Hall"" as a whole, no pun intended, it's just a movie about a guy who thinks himself as the center of this expanding universe and analyzes the world from his own perspective, he pompously and pretentiously expresses a cynicism disguised in wit to better hide his own self-loathing nature. At the end, it's all about talking and talking, it's a succession of good lines, of creative plot devices, something was lacking, but I couldn't point my finger what and where. I didn't really dislike ""Annie Hall"" but I disliked the fact that it was Allen's most popular film, the winner of the Best Picture Oscar, and I hated the fact that I couldn't get why this movie was great, what makes it such a gem. I almost wished I could have the real Allen with me to tell me what was so great about it.Three years have gone, I've seen almost all Allen's films, he became one of my favorite directors, I gained some cinematic maturity, and before I could watch ""Annie Hall"" again, I could at least put it in a chronological map in both Allen's filmography and History of Cinema. ""Annie Hall"" is the cinematic transition between Allen's slapstick period and his glorious streak of unique and creative films with autobiographical undertones that would reach its pinnacle in the 80's. It plays exactly like ""City Lights"" for Charlie Chaplin, the time we discover a character we're familiar with, involved in a more mature material, but never losing his appeal. It's not drama Woody, or romantic Woody, it's the same neurotic Woody with something new, that would defines his future work. Dr. Woody and Mr. Allen.""Annie Hall""'s year of release is also significant because it coincides with the new era of blockbusters that would put an end to the extraordinary New Hollywood wave, in a way, the story of Alvy Singer and Annie Hall, the beautiful singer, is the swan song of a form of artistic expression that can only pass for pretension because, now, we, modern or younger movie viewers are more familiar with characters who never display hints of intellectual superiority toward their audience, not in romantic comedies anyway. Would we ever have characters talking about stuff we don't know about, even if it's made to sound sophisticated and pretentious, like Freud, McLuhan or Swedish Cinema. Never, even Harry and Sally were discussing about ""Casablanca"" a much more approachable movie. I guess we blame Allen for being so indulgent because he can't make us feel indulgent toward his characters. But this is the gutsy aspect of ""Annie Hall"" and the contributor of its unique appeal.So, as a movie to enjoy on the present, ""Annie Hall"" is tricky, but if you have enough patience to let the film grow on you, it reaches the level of a valuable gem, and its victory over ""Star Wars"" is only the last agonizing breath before Cinema d'Auteur could take a big dive. And I hope you won't knock the previous intellectual masturbation about the universe, thank you.There was a joke I've always liked, about a little boy asking his father ""Dad, are we in America yet?"" to which his dad says ""Just shut up and keep on swimming"" Well, I guess this sums up my new feeling of ""Annie Hall"", its greatness is probably like this America, and I guess right now, I'm starting to see the coast.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mr.Cinema At His Best!,"Woody Allen aka Mr.Cinema, is At His Best in His 1977 Cult-Classic 'Annie Hall'. A Film so Wonderful & Addictive, it's hard to point out any flaws whatsoever.'Annie Hall' Synopsis: Neurotic New York comedian Alvy Singer falls in love with the ditsy Annie Hall.'Annie Hall', Which Won the Oscar for Best Picture, is about Love & it's Very Famous Complications. Alvy Singer, the Protagonist, played superbly by Allen, is an interesting person to follow in his journey. He wants Love, but when he has it, he doesn't really do much about it. It's a character, that is very real & the same time, confused.Allen & Marshall Brickman's Oscar-Winning Screenplay, Presents Love & It's Complications, with great humor & memorable dialogue. Allen's Oscar-Winning Direction, like always, is simple yet mesmerizing. His handling of this story indeed is awe-inspiring. Cinematography by Gordon Willis, is picture-perfect. Editing is pleasant.Performance-Wise: Allen dominates the show. He plays Alvy Singer superbly. Diane Keaton's Oscar-Winning Portrayal of Annie Hall, is indeed fantastic.

Diane Keaton shines!,"""Annie Hall"" from 1977, directed by and starring Woody Allen (of course), is a groundbreaking romantic comedy that almost redefined the genre with its innovative cinematic techniques and complex emotional depth. The film follows the neurotic, sometimes charming, other times annoying, constantly whining schmoe NYC comedian Alvy Singer, played by Allen, as he reflects on his failed relationship with the quirky and free-spirited Annie Hall. The extremely lovable and lovely Ms. Hall is ortrayed by Diane Keaton, who was Allen's co-star in many of his films, and she's nothing short of amazing in this. The film is known for its non-linear structure, breaking the fourth wall, and use of surrealist elements, such as the iconic scene with a split-screen that contrasts two characters' thoughts. The chemistry between Allen and Keaton is central to the film's effectiveness and works especially well, with Keaton's performance earning her a well deserved Academy Award for Best Actress. A high note of the film is definitely Keaton's sweet little bluesy nightclub song which demonstrates the range of her talents. The supporting cast includes Tony Roberts as Alvy's best friend Rob, Carol Kane as Alvy's ex-wife, Paul Simon in a cameo as Annie's ex-lover, along with memorable turns by Shelley Duvall and Christopher Walken. With a script (Allen and Marshall Brickman) that combines sharp wit, introspection, subtle satire, and emotional vulnerability, the movie was not only a critical success but also became a cultural touchstone. Incredibly, the film won four Oscars including Best Picture, and beat out notable films from the same year that included Star Wars, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Saturday Night Fever and others. Most believe this is Woody Allen's best overall film, in a career full of great ones and duds, but at the very least, it's his most accessable and is eminently rewatchable just to catch all the one-liners and nuances, which fly by at a breakneck pace. Movie storytelling at its very best.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Annie Hall,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, this is my second Woody Allen film, the first being Midnight in Paris which was very good. After watching this film, I hate Woody Allen. His character is narcissistic and rude. He always thinks about himself and his voice made me want to kill myself. The story is slow and boring. The characters constantly talk about sex and there is no way Woody Allen would ever get that much puss. He sleeps with at least five women throughout the film. That in and of itself is impossible. He is a short, ugly, and annoying man. The film is so shapeless and it repeats itself so many times, it is an utter chore to watch.The acting is bad. Woody Allen casted himself in a film he directed (He has an ego problem). He is really bad also. Diane Keaton is quite good though. She plays a quirky yet cute woman.The pacing is horrible. The film is slow and the runtime feels so long.All in all, Woody Allen sucks.Pros: Diane Keaton performs wellCons: Woody Allen plays a narcissistic and annoying man who thinks that he knows everything, Woody Allen would never get that much puss, the story is boring, the characters suck, bad acting, slow pacing, and a long runtime.Overall Rating: 3.0",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
As real as romance gets,"Has romance ever been captured more perfectly? And furthermore, is there anything more beautiful than the extreme awkwardness that comes with falling in love? ""Annie Hall"" is a very unconventional romance movie, by which I mean that it's not as distant as the average movie romance. You actually care about these people, because it appears as if they could actually exist. That's probably why this movie is so effective. The melancholic cinematography also gives it a raw power that is hard to describe. I've never really gotten into Woody Allen's filmography, and his neurotic character rarely stays interesting for an entire movie, but here it fits in perfectly. This is probably his most accessible movie, if not just his best.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ditzy and Neurotic Fall in Love,"Woody Allen shows what a masterful artist of directing, script writing, and acting he is in this romantic comedy drama. The script is honestly so funny, clever, and witty I could read it as a book over and over again. This movie is not for the dim witted as they wouldn't understand many of the jokes. You have to stay on your toes to keep up with this film, but you won't have any trouble paying attention with one joke rolling in after another. The cinematography and use of shadow in this film add to the artful and quirky feeling of the film, while also adding deep meaning to it through shadows. The plot portrays two unique and different people who are struggling to find their way in life and both completely over analyze they lives which makes for a funny comedy and drama about life, love, and being Jewish in NYC.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A comedy that combines psychology with laughter,"One of the best films rated by Allen's critics about Alvy Singer, a neurotic Jew divorced twice who talks about what he feels after breaking up with his girlfriend Annie Hall, an aspiring singer, going through all him failed loves and the attempts to find it overlooking the fact that their problems in their relationships are not because of the girls he meet just for his obssesions and paranoia.The way in which it is presented, appealing directly on some occasions with the viewer looking directly at the camera, making us participate in the dialogue and providing a psychological component to the comedy, making this work something truly ingenious.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Terrific writing,"I love the writing in this film. It is charming, witty, and often very humorous. The literary, religious, and cinematic references were very much appreciated. And of course the writing's full vitality is reached because of the performances of Allen and Keaton primarily. It takes such strong material to make the generally unheroic appearance of Allen sympathetic. If you are ever in the mood to wash out the bad taste of the latest mindless special effects blockbuster, I suggest popping the erudite Annie Hall into your DVD player 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
review #329,"I have never seen a movie reviewed more than this one. That fact alone should say it all but it doesn't. This is not a review as such but just some commentary. The first is that I haven't thought about the fact that there are reviews here from people who were not even born when this movie was made. Never thought about that. Hmmm, I was a grown up 21 when it came out. Since I was born and raised in Brooklyn and NYC and lived here my whole life, I had always felt that this was ""my"" movie. Woody was considered, in my era and age group, an alien being in the land of Hollywood. He WAS one of us. I felt threatened that he made a real ""movie"" when AH was released. I had always considered him an underground NY guy, so, no one was gonna take him away from us. This is the reason I felt threatened. My only consolation was that now the rest of the world would finally ""see"" what an amazingly gifted artist we had here. OK, enough. You get the point. Now on to other goodies. First and foremost, Tony Roberts. I love this guy. That they (Woody & Tony) called each other Max thruout the movie was to me, an inside joke because best friends usually did this. In my case, my best friend Frank and me (rob) called each other Dukey. Always! Still do 55 years later. TR is such a natural, gifted actor that it was not acting he did, it was living! His oneness with his characters were incredible. Never for one minute did I see any of the actors here acting! That is how great Woody Allen is. He brings it out of his actors. Their characters are living human beings! Diane Keaton nailed it. Not only her beauty, for which she is one of the prettiest, sexiest and most gorgeous creatures ever seen on screen, look at her today, hasn't lost a drop! This trio - WA, DK and TR, who worked together in Play It Again Sam, could have been a rock group they are so great!! The last point I'd like to make is that Woody's genius is that he can make inanimate, animate! Unreal - real, funny-sad and so on. What a gift to be living in the same era as these three.

Not aged well. Not a high brow movie but a thoughtful and interesting one aesthetically.,"Maybe one day when I have a lot more life experience I will rewatch this and think ""Wow! this is so clever and deft and assessing modern relationships and is a hilarious bouquet of daring narrative techniques"".But for now I am very unimpressed by the minimalist approach. By this I mean two things: the very laisszez fair approach to visualization with a lot of long takes and static cameras and also the simple narrative in which rather than a linear story we get a collage of episodes that illustrate this sometimes passionate, sometimes floundering romance.The crux of the problem is no interesting characters or intrigue to really get us started. They're in a relationship from the beginning; there's no meetcute or even a meet-painful to subvert that trope. I guess Allen was trying to give us a sort of anti-romance, the thing ""The Break-up"" should have been.But although I'm a big cheerleader for Allen's vision of the hypochondrical, self-hating New Yorker, he simply hasn't much going for him with the context provided. Annie herself basically has no personality asides old fashioned sweet girliness. Yeah, she wears a suit and she looks fabulous. But it just seems arbitrary.The episodes themselves are just mundane. They aren't gags, they're just bland slice of life in that unhappy medium between being funny or being poignant. They're neither.The surrealist gags are sort of interesting but they get old really quickly because they are more gimmicky than clever. To give a couple of examples: at one point they converse and we get subtitles. But these subtitles do not convey the subtext of what they're saying, they just give inner thoughts therefore totally missing the translation element I was expecting. At another point we get an animated section where the sudden animation basically IS the joke.I suppose this was sort of edgy in the '70s but now it just seems like the same tropes that are the bread and butter in modern relationship humour.The ""innovations"" like turning directly to the camera are also just gimmicks that aren't used to any effect. Bug Bunny did that and he did it in a funny way.In fits and starts I sort of want to like it. It's not an obnoxious movie and it comes from a good place creatively. Allen and Keaton play their parts impeccably even if the script is never naturalistic or stylized enough for them to ever do much with it.The exact romance depicted is agreeable. It neither burns bright or hot but is a convincing meeting of two different types of people having a believable connection even if it isn't a viable one. I like the lobster motif. I did not laugh once.I would recommend ""Crimes and Misdemeanours"" or ""Whatever Works"" above this movie if you're curious about Woody Allen and, like me, you don't find ""relatable"" humor that funny.It isn't a high brow movie, it just stepped out of the mould for a bit.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
La Di Da,"Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) is a 40 year old comedian who is not really satisfied with what life is presenting him with. He's Jewish, but not really a firm believer. Despite that he feels that everybody is on his case, because he is a jew. His friend Rob (Tony Roberts) tries to convince Alvy that he's not being mistreated because of his religion. One day Rob invites him to a tennis match, and that's where we meet Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), a wannabe singer. The two singles carefully gets closer. It's Annie who takes the lead, and she soon decides to move in with Alvy. Is this perhaps a match made in Heaven?It's arguably Woody Allens most fun film. Nearly every sentence ends on a joke, real good ones at that.As in most Allen films there's quite a few actors from the A-list. As former girlfriends of Alvy you can see Carol Kane, Shelley Duvall and Janet Margolin. As Annie's brother, Duane, a crazy Christopher Walken as the musician Tony Lacey we have Paul Simon. In bit parts Jeff Goldblum, Sigourney Weaver and Beverly D'Angelo.With a cast like that you can't go wrong, and Allen really doesn't, this is without a doubt one of the very best film he has made.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"I love it, I lurve it, I luff it","I saw Annie Hall for the first time when I was in 5th grade. At the time I didn't understand much of it, but I still thought it was excellant. I saw it again the next year and I liked it even better. I have seen it now numerous times, and it gets better and funnier every time I see it. It is my all time favorite film, and it makes me sick to my stomach knowing that many kids my age have never seen it, let alone know who Woody Allen is. This movie is not only one of the funniest I've ever seen, but also one of the greatest love stories ever recorded on film. Forget Casablanca or Citizen Kane, Annie Hall gets my vote for best picture. I love the all the jokes in the script, which I might add, is one of the best I've ever read, but also I think the acting in it is just fabulous. So if you don't mind me saying so- I'll pick Annie Hall over Gone With the Wind any time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
movie review,"This was a great movie. This was a Woody Allen Classic. Annie Hall was so unconventionally entertaining and humorous, like most of Allen's films Annie Hall combined screwball humor with romantic sexual jokes. This movie was amazing. The movie also had a very high end Manhattan artsy like feel to it. The shot composition was very independent like and the acting and overall mood of the movie had Manhattan all over it. It's always funny how an artsy New York Movie can look so different in terms of style compared to a higher budget box office hit, usually shot in California. This movie also had Allen's style written all over it. Classic lack of invisibility. Allen loves to play it out as if he's aware of the camera the entire time, sometimes even narrating to it randomly. In Annie Hall you'll see some examples of this, their is no real definitive line between the films diegesis, in some scenes. He also played out Annie Hall as if he plays himself and his everyday life and a camera is documenting him and his relationship with Annie. It's fascinating actually how unconventional Woody Allen's style is, but it always works. Not to mention the movie had very artsy photography and hilariously absurd humor, like usual I'd expect nothing less coming from Woody Allen. Genius.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why the hell is this movie a classic?????,"I guess its a generational thing, maybe you had to be alive when it came out because I hated it and I usually have film tastes that are fairly aligned with the general populations. Oh well! I thought I'd love it because I'm Jewish but I was very wrong. Barely could watch the whole thing.Annie Hall contains humor that is supposed to be subtle and therefore I assume ""cultured"" or ""intelligent"". There were one or two things I found humorous about it, but I thought it was so slow paced and boring that I can barely even recall a plot line (if there was one).Yet another movie where Woody Allen makes Jews look like wimps and Diane Keaton has shoulder pads and looks like Paula Poundstone in men's clothing.I love New York but Annie Hall put a small tinge in that love!",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Neurotic New Yawkers I couldn't relate to...but the point is taken and appreciated............,"Annie Hall thrives on Allen's comic bantering and developing characters as richly as their own narrowness and shortcomings would allow (the only non-cardboard characters are really Annie and Alvie themselves...but Marshall McLuhan has a cameo!) I particularly enjoyed the way the characters' childhood trauma, relationship sore-spots, and personal psyche are played out, while they are on-screen watching themselves and talking to us about themselves. Very theatre-like. One favorite moment is the montage sequence of Alvie's frustration at his stalling romance with Annie, reinforced by shots of a young Alvie going bananas at the bumper cars. Freud would probably have loved breaking apart Annie Hall ;-)The film tells Alvie and Annie's relationship in multiple flashbacks and vignette-episodes. This drives home the point of their personalities. It's also VERY effective in giving you a migraine from its neurotic structure and characters. This being Woody Allen, I expected a lot of laughs and was not disappointed. The ending is quite bittersweet and the best way, not over-sentimental or romanticized, to conclude a humorous look at relationships.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I am Woody Allen's great fan and have seen a lot of his works.  Annie Hall is unique, filled with brilliant dialogues which makes you laugh no matter how often you hear them.  Quickly running sequence of events makes us realize the fragility of our relationships.  It's all about our lives, perfect mirror of our everyday ridiculous behaviour.  Woody certainly knows how to turn it over, take this and that, mix it, squeeze it, put some irony in it and create a masterpiece.  Stunning appearance of Diane Keaton (I dare to say it's her best role) speaks for itself.  Can't miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Woody's Best!,"We follow the life of Alvy Singer (Woody Allen), growing up under a roller coaster, failed romances, and a new romance with the love of his life... Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) Most people consider Comedy/ Romances to be either Chick Flicks or Date Movies for girls.Well, while this could be called a Date Movie, it's most definitely not only for girls. It's for all. It's what I call a ""Smile Movie"" that you just sit there, smiling for an hour and a half until the movie's done. It makes you feel good, and it's really funny! The tag line, ""A nervous romance."" is correct. Both Alvy and Annie are quite fun characters. Alvy, a comedian who always worries and Annie, an awkward woman with a wonderful laugh and a small additicion to drugs.Woody Allen's movies are usually 6/5 (In my opinion), for being fun flicks with a few laughs but just an all around feel good feel to them- but this one's special. The feel good-ness is cranked up even higher, along with the laughs! So grab your sweetheart (or your sweetheart-to-be) or just when you're feelin blue, pop this in and enjoy!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

American classic that should be Library of Congress,"Woody Allen's greatest film. A work of art and shows that script writing is equal to a theater or a novel. The script reads better than many novels.Throughout the story flashbacks come in of his failed relationships. This is familiar Allen territory. His inability to hold a relationship tog ether as a metaphor for life. In less adept hands this would be self indulgent drivel. But Allen who developed his art from the 1960s onwards brings charm and warmth that would upset any of his therapists charging a $100 an hour to prove that the patient is a nut job. Of course there is the equal Allen insecurities, so to say, of psychotherapy being an answer to everything or does it cause more anxiety which needs more analysis and that costs more money which could be spent on building relationships an do you need money for relationships and so on.Once Alvy and Annie have broken up he tries to piece his life back together and its Annie that shows that once he lets go of his selfishness life is a lot easier.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Incredible,"This is the first film by Allen I've ever watched, and it definitely will not be the last. The writing is extremely sharp. With the help of a couple of old and already famous analogous jokes, Woody makes several impeccable points that hold up today. In fact, in the most important areas, this could have been made today, not over three decades ago. The pieces of truth and commentary are compelling, and the delivery of them is spot-on. Editing and cinematography are good. This is marvelously directed. The long takes are impressive, and the form doesn't draw too much attention to itself. Breaking the fourth wall is used to great effect. The acting is excellent. This is perfectly paced, and this shark does not die. Nothing is excessive or out of place. The humor is utterly hilarious. This is about forty-ish TV funny-man Alvy Singer, and more specifically, his love-life. The characters are interesting and well-developed. Every line of dialog is pure gold, and flawlessly delivered. Language is mild, with a few references to sex. There is drug content in this. I recommend this to everyone, as long as they have a reasonable base of the knowledge required to understand the references and such, and are not turned off by the neurotic lead. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
You have to hate Allen ...,"You really have to hate Woody Allen not to like this movie. There are some who find Allen's Humor too drab or neurotic. Others feel that he's a bit narcissustic, casting himself as a love interest to pretty women. However, as Allen is quick to point out in this classic comedy, Narcissus is not a Greek god he most identifies with, he's more likely to identify with... Zeus.This is a great piece of work with terrific comedic innovations, such as the scene with the subtitled thoughts, the flashback to school mates (tell them what you're doing now) and the bringing out of Marshall McLuhan to make his point (wouldn't it be great if life were like this?).The acting is superb and the character's are interesting from Christopher Walken's (crazy brother)to Paul Simon's (personification of L.A) this film simply works.A must see comedy, even if you hate Woody Allen, you may still be enamored with Alvy Singer.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Innovative, Insightful and Marvelous","I was 16 and I hadn't seen a single Woody Allen film. I didn't even know how he looked, just had a vague recollection of his name. I got a pirated DVD of American films from the 70s and it had Annie Hall in it. It was the last film from the DVD that I saw. A lot of the philosophy in the film went over my head at that moment, but the humour left me in splits. There are times when you more than just like something, but you can't exactly give a reason why. I felt like that for the film. Of course I can give a thousand different reasons to like every Woody film now, but at 16, I couldn't. I just knew that I loved the film. And what I liked best in the film was the guy who played Alvy Singer, and when he broke the 4th wall to address us directly. I hadn't gone through the credits and didn't know that the guy was Woody himself. I had a slow dial up connection and made good use of it to find more information about the film. And that's when I learnt that Woody didn't just direct it, he wrote as well as acted in it. And Diane Keaton was his one time girlfriend. Hell, I wanted a girlfriend like Diane Keaton, its a completely different thing though, that in my teens, I ended up with someone like Mia Farrow, which pretty much messed things up a lot !! Anyway, after reading more about Woody and his many talents, I became fascinated with the man. Even more so because I could personally relate to him. He was short, shy, neurotic and had a lot to say. That pretty much summed me up as well. I so wanted to be like Woody Allen. The next plan of action was to watch as many Woody films as possible. I didn't have enough pocket money to buy over 35 original DVDs worth over 500 bucks each, and Downloading wasn't an option then. So I went around pirated DVD stores looking for films directed by Woody and within 2 months I managed to find around 20 !! Its been 9 years since then, and I've seen every single film written, directed or acted by Woody and I love every single one of them. Woody means different things to different people, but to me, he is the man who taught me to laugh at myself. And because I have a similar cynical world view to his, it was a terrific thing to learn. Also, I don't think anybody else understands Women better than Woody and watching and re-watching his films meant entering inside the mysterious minds of the fairer sex. Trust me, for all the guys who don't look like Brad Pitt or aren't sons of Warren Buffett, and want to get laid, watch Woody Films. His films also subtly introduced me to the intriguing and revealing world of Freud and Psychotherapy, and I've been hooked. Given a chance, I would exhume his brain and build a shrine around it !! Woody Allen and Annie Hall specially, mean the world to me.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Brains meets Love,"An amazingly heart felt tale for what it is, in the technical aspects the film is perfectly fine, excelling in set design and the creation of an immersive atmosphere. Following the romantic tales of a smart Jewish comedian falling in love with a ditsy woman trying to get herself straight.

It's another true to life scenario with how things go, focusing on the complexity of relationships and how much then can go to affect how somebody does things, and how much one can change a person.

I just don't get it.,"I've heard people talk about Annie Hall since I was a kid. I finally get around to watching this the other day, and MAN what a snoozer! Zzzzzzzzz....(My wife literally fell asleep!) Anyway, this movie *might* have been fresh back in 1977 when it came out, but watching it today is like watching paint dry. Who *cares* about Annie Hall anyway? She's just this fruity 70's hippy who has nothing going for her. Woody Allen (IMHO) only ""had it"" back in the 70's, but even this definitely wasn't his best production. Oh well, flame me if you must, but I say take this one OUT of the top 100!!

HK Neo Reviews: Annie Hall,"Tagline: Woody Allen – you little genius...Upon watching Woody Allen's Oscar winning 1977 Best Picture – Annie Hall, I just realise how late I was. Being late to a packed classroom is rather embarrassing, but it is still better than the lad who is still at home sleeping, missing out the action all together. That is precisely the feeling I ended up feeling. It is not easy for a romantic drama/comedy to still be relevant in exactly 33 years later. Like many of the gen Y, Woody Allen plus Scarlet Johansson is already what we known him as. It is little wonder why nearly everyone have become disappointed in Allen. He is certainly capable of much more. Annie Hall have all the trademarks of Mr. Allen's witty dialogue, monologue and basically people talking, talking and more talking. He likes to linger a shot longer and let the audience inside the movie, rather than the other way around. Sometimes, I wonder how a movie is going to affect me, but interestingly, it is the lack of musically impact that make Annie Hall more powerful and relating. The characters are quite simply humans. If the movie is about a lot of things, it is essentially a love story. The number of memorable scenes and dialogue is simply unforgettable. Understanding and following Woody and Diane Keaton conservations is like a re-dux of our own lives. It may not seem much, but for once, a film justifiably lusted out Star Wars for Best Picture and rightly so.The movie goes like this: Woody Allen begins the movie heartbroken and from there the tale of his past relationships are shown in spades of time. However, the focus is really on his love story with Annie Hall. The connection, the meeting, the moments, the sex, the table talks, the cinema lines, the harbour views, the departure, the ending and the cafe are all essentially part of making up who Allen is trying to portray. Essentially a movie about a love lost, the difficult to find that compatibility, but portrayed in the wittiest of manner.There are moments that you seem as though you are the characters in the movie. Talks like a couple at a restaurant talking about the family table next to them or the couple walking along the way. Small talks are what couples do and Allen conveys exactly that. There is another scene where after his first time sex with Annie, he smartly remarks: ""There goes another novel."" Other classic scenes that stayed in my memory would be the long cinema line, where the guy behind Woody keeps talking about a certain movie and it got to the point where Woody approached the camera and ranted out his frustration of the guy knowing nothing. The guy in return confronted the camera to explain himself and Woody pulls out the producer of the movie to explain that the guy is wrong. It may sound tedious, but it is these subtle moments that makes the movie work. Being able to keep up with Allen's character and the things he say is a vital part of relationships. Towards the end, when he is picking up lobsters with a new muse, he did a witty remark and the fact that the girl didn't understand him, it compels his instincts that reminds him of the connection he had with Annie is irreplaceable.Woody Allen is one of the wittiest film-maker around and his performance here seem extremely realistic. Whether or not, the reason for this is because of the way he plays around with the audience, constantly talking to them, looking at the camera, dreaming of events and simply through continuous talking. On surface and appearance along, Diane Keaton does not match with Woody, but as the movie goes on, you know exactly why they were a couple. There is that connection of words and minds between the two. As the movie continues the audience can look back or forward to their relationships and realise it is precisely the flow of conversation that make the relationship unique and work. For me, I cannot comprehend a girl that does not understand the manner, the tone of something I am trying to say and for Woody it seems true. That is why Diane Keaton is so amazing, she speaks her mind, she understands Woody and she knows when to move on. After-all the film does end with something like – ""but love fades"".All in all, Annie Hall is a masterpiece. It is a timeless movie on many different levels. The dialogue is top notched. The direction and editing are suitably creative. Comedies hardly ever win Best Picture and for it to win over a blockbuster of a film in Star Wars, it is an unprecedented achievement. Perhaps what Woody did in Annie Hall may never be repeated and nor should it ever be. Full marks for Woody for saying that he will never direct a sequel to this, as some films should have been left as it was. Like Before Sunrise, the film is about people talking, living, eating, talking, sexing and more talking. It is a film that you need to let go of the boundaries of the movie experience and let the joy comes along the way. Movies like these are magical and grow onto you more and more after the credit rolls. What I really enjoyed is the fact that the movie somehow affected me without the usual gimmicks of emotional soundtrack, but rather through witty and relevant dialogues and real human characters that interacts to make Annie Hall, the romantic comedy of the century...(Neo 2010)I rate it 10/10www.thehkneo.com",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Allen's acting, directing and writing was great,too.This was the first Woody Allen movie i watched and it seems i will love the other ones. The legendary(!)

The Best Woddy Allen Film,"Whether you like Woddy Allen as a person or not, I'd have a hard time believing you can't find this film funny. He plays an incredibly sympathetic character, Alvy (who closely resembles Allen) whose constant narration gives you a unique look at the inner workings of his mind. This narration, coupled with the subtitles in the scene where Alvy and Annie Hall get acquainted are prime examples of Allen's ability to push the boundaries of reality all while keeping things fresh and funny. He plays his typical Woddy Allen role as a man chasing a girl, Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) but if you've seen previous works of his you'll notice that this film is much more serious than earlier ones, he poses questions about fate and destiny but he still adds his little touch of humor (a great example is the flash back to the younger Alvy, the kid who played him is hysterical given the coupling of adult feelings with a child's dialogue). The film is shot beautifully and you may notice some similarities to the Godfather in this area as both films used Gordon Willis for cinematography.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Woody's best?,"Although I debate as to whether or not I truly believe it, I often find myself believing that ""Annie Hall"" is Woody Allen's best film. This statement is strongly challenged by Woody's other masterpieces like ""Manhattan"", ""Hannah and Her Sisters"", ""Crimes and Misdermeanors"", ""Interiors"", and ""Another Woman"", but I have to firmly stand by it because of the fact that this film marked Woody's evolution from the Funniest Man in the Movies to one of cinema's great auteurs. From here Woody graduated from the slapstick silliness of ""Bananas"" and ""Love and Death"" to the more emotionally and intellectually mature mature films he has been making since then (save one or two). The film takes on the major subject of romantic relationships in the sway of big-city life, and how two people who are perfect for eachother in so many ways can be terrible for eachother in so many others. The film stars Woody Allen as Alvy Singer and Diane Keaton (who won as Oscar for her performance) as the title character. The entire movie is centered around how Annie enlightens Alvy's life for a brief moment, then is driven away by his neuroses and selfishness, and how Alvy learns ultimately from the experience that relationships are a matter of give-and-take: you give the best of yourself and take all the bad parts of the other person in stride. If I'm making this film sound like a pathos-spouting art-film retread, I'm sorry. Because what makes this film alive is how Allen's whipsmart wit and eccentric characteristics color the film. The film is, simply stated, flat-out hysterical. Like the scene where Alvy produces Marshall McLuhan to dismiss a film-buff cineaste snob, or Christopher Walken's small, but hysterical role as Annie's space-cadet brother. Or the scene where Annie and Alvy struggle with a live lobster in the kitchen (later used as a payoff as Alvy tries unsuccessfully to recreate the moment with an uninterested woman interest after the breakup with Annie), and the famous cocaine sneeze. And what about Alvy describing a cockroach as ""big as a Buick"", Tony Roberts lecturing about his ""anti-aging"" head-sunroof, and a young Alvy losing all faith in existence in grade school (""If the Universe keeps expanding, one day it's going to break apart-and then where will we be?"")? Through it all, however, is the inevitable truth that Annie is just too alive for Alvy-characterized by her yearning for the Los Angeles sun as opposed to Alvy's refusal to leave drab New York. The bittersweet ending has Alvy mining his heartbreak for Broadway success, and meeting Annie for lunch one day. At the end of the get-together, we see, in long shot, Annie and Alvy say their goodbyes at a street corner. As Alvy narrarates, we see Annie, then Alvy leave our sight. But the narraration continues as we look at the empty street corner. The movie ends up as Alvy tells us the ""my brother is crazy, he thinks he's a chicken"" joke-a humorous anecdote symbolic of his entire relationship conundrum. It's this quiet ending scene that ends ""Annie Hall"", one of the funniest movies ever made, on a perfect note. The film where Woody showed that he was a master.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Rationalinzing Romance,"This movie thoroughly deserves an 8 or a more than that rating. This movie is unlike other over the top love stories which you experience otherwise. This is the story of a man trying to put in the grey areas of love out and yet make you understand that it still is love.Woody Allen, the protagonist, tries to give a narrative of his story of love with Annie Hall. The movie just is a narrative of how they meet, how they make love, what are their sex issues and other things which are common in any relationship. But the idea is to make these common things uncommon with Allen's style narratives.Where the character pops out of the screen and talks to the audience, where the character goes into his own past and tries to analyse his past etc are tools Allen uses to make the scenes humorous and yet conveying a point in existence.I cant comment on whether this movie deserved an Oscar cause i haven't seen its counterparts.

Simple but firm.,"This was my first woody Allen film and I must say that I am impressed. To be more precise his acting was amazing. In the starting of the film woody Allen talks directly to you and then starts the amazing ride towards the personal life of two couples. I read on the Wikipedia that he denies any similarity of the film with his own but this thought comes to everyone. This is I suppose because woody Allen himself acted and he acted so well along with a top notch direction. The film also looked as if it had been shot like a documentary but that seemed only for a few moments in the starting. In the middle there is a lot of talk between the two major characters and they were talking a lot related to nonsense and I kind of drifted away that instant but that was for a moment and now I think that was apt according to the story. For the story I would say that it is fairly OK but the direction and the acting along with the dialogs made the film an unforgettable experience.""A must watch film for film lovers.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Allen at his Best,"There seems to be kind of a dividing line between those Woody Allen fans whose favorite Allen film is Manhattan and those who prefer Annie Hall.I've seen Manhattan many times (it's one of my all-time favorite films) and only recently saw Annie Hall for the first time.These two films are of course quite similar, so basically the members of both groups mentioned above like the same thing.Manhattan is probably a bit more positive and less edgy. But also not _quite_ as funny as Annie Hall which really contains some of the most memorable Allen comedy ever. If you like his witty, sarcastic humor, full of references and innuendo, then this film is for you.Many things have been written here about the filmmaking box of tricks that Allen put to generous use for this piece. And yes, the tricks work. Despite the film's age they come across as fresh and inventive - because they make sense and were used cleverly and not just for the sake of gimmickery.OK. I think I still like Manhattan better. Which makes Annie Hall a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Without a doubt the GREATEST romantic Comedy EVER MADE!,"Woody Allen's ANNIE HALL is my favorite movie of all time. Simply because it manages to keep the perfect pitch throughout it's length. The film is very funny throughout, without repeating jokes, or even going down the road to sick toilet humor. It is hard to say why I and thousands other people like this movie so much, I think its because the more familiar you are with it, the more you like it. Some movies, even great movies get old the more you watch them, but with Annie Hall, you get excited every time you know a great line or great scene is coming up.The movie is filled with great moments, not surprising considering that the plot not only centers around Woody Allen's character's relationship with Diane Keaton's character (Annie Hall), but with themes of obsession, religious differences, loneliness, and if there's a price to pay for love. Every romantic comedy made since this movie owes it something (especially ""When Harry Met Sally""), and if you are familiar with a lot of modern sitcoms, especially the TV show ""Friends,"" you'll notice how much was derived from here. (For six million dollars a week, you'd think they could afford orignal scripts) There are thousands of scenes and lines in the movie worth calling attention to here, but if you haven't seen the movie yet, you deserve to see them without expecting them, so I won't mention them here.Annie Hall won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director (Woody Allen), Best screenplay written for the screen (Woody Allen and Marshall Brickman) and for Diane Keaton's performance as Annie Hall. Her performance is without a doubt one of the greatest performances ever done by an actress, actually, but anyone, take notice of the scene where Annie tells Alvy Singer(played by Woody Allen) that she misses him. She starts crying, then hits her bed with her fist. She loves him, but is ashamed of being weak. That is such an honest, subtle, and perfect motion that I really start to care for Annie at that point-and so does Alvy, because we start to overlook her flaws (her carelessness, immaturity, and her naivety and so forth), and really start to care about her. Woody Allen also gives a good performance, but unline Ms. Keaton, he knows he's performing (when he breaks the forth wall by talking to the camera), but still gives one of the best monologues I've ever seen. (notice how his hands never stand still, yet never make the same movement twice- every physical comedian should take note of this, from Jim Carrey to Groucho Marx)I first saw this movie when I was in 7th grade, and laughed uproariously at the animated segment, and all the one-liners and jokes (its amazing how with this amount of jokes, every single one of them works, none miss their mark) when it was over, I rewound it, and started over again. Now that I'm older, and hopefully more mature, the movie is even better, and the last scene never fails to inspire me, and the jokes that used to make me laugh, still do, with the added bonus of my also getting the more subtle ones as well.Woody Allen is one of the all-time great film-makers, and this is his masterpiece in my opinion, there are no flaws in the script, even though it has flash-forward, flash-backs etc, etc. He makes one movie a year on average, and he writes, directs, and usually stars in them too. If there's one person who I'd want to continue working, it'd be him. If you want to start watching Woody Allen movies but are unsure where to start, Annie Hall is a great place to start, its modern, yet a classic.If I haven't made the movie sound as good as it is to me, that is my fault, and not the movie's. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I suggest you go out and watch it now, making sure you don't read its IMDB quote page. Best to watch this movie, and be wonderfully surprised. I would be surprised if you don't love this movie. You've have to have a heart of stone to resist it. It is very funny, quite moving at sometimes, inspiring, perfectly acted and written. It deserves it's awards, and it's place on AFI's 100 best movies of all time (I think #32). Movies like this are the reason cinema was invented.NOTE: If you like ANNIE HALL, here are some other great Woody Allen movie you might enjoy: Manhattan, Love & Death, Stardust Memories, Hannah and Her Sisters, and Crimes and Misdemeanors.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Warm, Loose And Funny","Woody Allen's breakthrough as a filmmaker is a loose, episodic look at a modern relationship and it combines the best of Allen' earlier films with a melancholia that would turn exceedingly dour in his later work. It's aided immeasurably by the winning Diane Keaton in the title role; she's fresh and funny and although the story is not told in a linear fashion, you can see her maturation and self-determination as the film progresses. Much can be made about Allen's vindictive treatment of women (and, in his later films, there's plenty of justification to criticize his views) but it should be noted than Allen skewers plenty of men here, most notably himself; he's always castigated himself in order to elicit your pity but this time there's a self-flagellation that seems hard, unforgiving and realistic. He also manages to make this one of his funniest films: many of the lines (by Allen and Marshall Brickman) are unforgettable. After `Manhattan' Allen's consistency would dry up (he apparently never recovered from `Interiors' and `Stardust Memories') but here his talents are in full bloom.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Delightful Woody Allen Flick,"Woody Allen's use of interesting and unusual comic techniques is exemplified in this movie. The scene where he inserts his present self into a memory of himself as a child in elementary school then has a conversation with the past version of his classmates as they are in the present was fantastic if a bit complicated to describe in writing.Aside from the one possibly too long scene of Annie singing at the night club for the second time, ""Annie Hall"" flows well and feels natural even though there are several occasions of the fourth wall being intentionally broken by Allen. The camera work, acting, and writing are all great and meld together well, though there was a scene or two I felt was so dark it was difficult to see the actors. I understand this is a signature of Gordon Willis, but I found it distracted from the story a bit as I was jarred out of the moment by not being able to see as well as I would have liked.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

I don't hang around a ""well-watched"" crowd so I haven't heard first-hand about his comic originality.  However, I am unable to say anything negative about him now because I've seen this flick and I am extremely impressed.  The aspect of this film that impresses me the most is the way the characters are portrayed and the way we see them change.  I wouldn't say the plot takes the back seat, but discovering more about Annie's personality and the way she comes together as a character is done flawlessly.  I like that Woody has no fear of confusing his audience with his changes in perspective.  I see this movie and I know it's hard for others not to make their own movies similarity-free to this one, as small as they may be.  I don't know the specifics on the originality of his methods or what was already considered conventional in comedy films in his day, but it is easy to see that his style is definitely his own, and it is funny. I want to type in some specific events from the film that I find remarkable, but I don't want to ruin the experience for you.  I just suggest watch it if you haven't already.  Why not, watch it again if you have seen it.  I don't even want to like Woody, but when you get down to it he's downright hilarious, and this movie is undeniable proof.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"An intelligent, tongue-in-cheek look at relationships","""Annie Hall"" is Woody Allen's acclaimed comedy about the troubled relationship between Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) and Annie Hall (Diane Keaton).

It's impossible for me to remember all of the great moments in ""Annie Hall"" simply because every moment is amusing and clever.

Define Neurotic...,"This is easily my favorite Woody Allen film I've seen- it's incredibly smart, thoughtful and funny. There are a few gags that also run too long. One particular gag is when Woody Allen and Diane Keaton are standing in line waiting to buy movie tickets, and during this scene a cinephile spouts his opinions on the films of Fellini and Samuel Fuller (nothing like pandering to the audience).Though I have a few minor qualms, that's what they are: minor. A majority of this movie is absolutely astounding, really funny, and undeniably influential.

It is a romantic comedy, which tells the events that led to the relationship between these two and their separation.I really liked this one.

All the characters were well written as well. I enjoyed Allen's character in this one, he was nervous, funny and cynical as always, but in a more believable way. Annie Hall was just great, a goofy woman who tries to figure out what she wants in her life. The acting was pretty good. The soundtrack was perfect, but I was expecting that, I mean it's a Woody Allen, what else could I expect? I almost cried laughing at the cocaine scene, it was hilarious.Another thing I loved was the means of storytelling, it was something different watching him talking directly to the camera.Summing up, there was just the right amount of humor, cynicism and philosophy, accompanying a beautiful and original story.

A neurotic love letter to the city of New York,If you love New York City and you love comedy then you must love Woody Allen's Annie Hall(1977). Allen's presentation of the Big Apple captures everything that makes it the greatest city in the world and Allen's sense of humor ranks with the greatest comedic minds in cinematic history. The way that Allen is able to incorporate so many jokes into what is basically an existential examination of romantic relationships is revolutionary and has influenced a generation of comedians to explore deeper issues through the use of comedy but none have been able to match the genius of Allen and his work in Annie Hall. Woody Allen's comedy is something of an acquired taste but I have a hard time believing that anyone who watches Annie Hall and doesn't enjoy it isn't an anti-Semite.,9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Woody's Last Laugh?,"It took ""Star Wars"" to get the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to acknowledge Woody Allen's contribution to film.In 1978, the A.M.P.A.S. had a problem: What to name best picture of the year before? High-art dramatic pictures like ""The Turning Point,"" ""Julia,"" and ""Equus,"" didn't really capture anyone's fancy the way previous winners had. And the films that did grab people by the throat were too mass-market for the elite's comfort: ""Saturday Night Fever,"" ""Close Encounters Of The Third Kind,"" and especially ""Star Wars."" Out of duress, the Oscars were then forced to do something it rarely did before: Choose a comedy.It was thus a perfect year for ""Annie Hall,"" Allen's latest comedy, of a more serious bent than his past comedies but still laugh-out-loud funny. Woody plays Alvy Singer, a stand-up comic who starts the film telling the audience he just turned 40 and is feeling down after breaking up with his latest girlfriend, Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). The film then goes back to examine that relationship from its beginning through their development as a couple until a fateful moment aboard a plane when they realize what they have on their hands is not love but a dead shark.I like ""Annie Hall,"" a lot more often than not. It's not a terribly engaging story, but it contains brilliant comic episodes. You feel immediately affected by Annie as Alvy is, seeing in her not the typical Diane Keaton of past Allen comedies, but someone more vulnerable and alert. The acting is stupendous, very real-feeling line readings that come across like spying on our part. And there is the rare gift of seeing a relationship end, not with recrimination, but a sense of mature grace.A lot of people say ""Annie Hall"" is Allen's best film. I don't. For pure comedy, ""Sleeper,"" made before, was funnier and a better story besides. Later on, I'd choose ""Zelig"" and ""Hannah And Her Sisters"" over this, and others who have seen them mention ""Manhattan"" and ""Crimes And Misdemeanors."" It was just that 1977 was a good year for a comedy, and Woody Allen had a good comedy out. If it didn't go to him, it would have been Neil Simon's ""The Goodbye Girl"" instead, at least according to my theory.People say this was the last time Allen made a real comedy, and I agree more with that, but not completely. What happened was that this was the last time Allen made a comedy for everyone, albeit one about the cultural elite. After ""Annie Hall,"" he made films for the cultural elite alone. He later made films more for laughs than ""Annie Hall,"" but not before shedding most of his wider audience with films like ""Interiors"" and ""Stardust Memories."" ""Annie Hall"" is about relationships, with which we can all identify. It contains five or six of his best-known quotes, and funniest situations. Some parts of the film have aged better than others. I still get a big laugh out of the lobster incident and the his/her dichotomy over ""three times a week."" I keep my opinions to myself in theater lobbies out of fear someone will drag out Marshall McLuhan. Parts of the movie, like Keaton singing ""Seems Like Old Times,"" appeals to me more now than it did then.It would be a better film if the relationship with Annie had as much of a window on her life as it does on his, if there was more done with the Tony Roberts character other than a handful of droll conversations, and if Woody's social commentary was more spot on, rather than revealing how isolated he was getting. Witness his takes on rock music or West Coast culture, which feel horribly narrow.But you have to love a film that sets up Paul Simon as the other guy, draws laughs from ""The Sorrow And The Pity"", and plays with narrative structure in such an accessible style. I don't think ""Annie Hall"" the best film of 1977, but have no problem with its selection. Woody and comedy got their due.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Nearly Brilliant, and Hilarious.","I've liked Woody Allen and his movies since the moment I knew who he was and what they were like. I find it hard not to like him, in pretty much every aspect. I'll admit, I understand his neurotic side to a degree, which I think can definitely help add to my fondness for him, and either way, he's great at what he does. It took me a long time to finally get to see Annie Hall, but, when I did, I was glad that I got to. I have also always liked the chemistry between Woody Allen and Diane Keaton, and I found their characters in this movie to be relatively more normal than in, say, a movie like ""Sleeper"". And of course, Woody Allen's wit is just smart and sharp in general, and in my opinion, it is irresistible. Ultimately, this is one of my favorite comedies, especially from the era, and I think that it will continue to be loved by many generations to come. I hope so, at least.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good cerebral entertainment, and is at times playfully surreal in an everyday way.","Annie Hall is the film notorious for beating out Star Wars for Best Picture. So, is this a case where the Academy picked the right film and those plebs just lack in good taste? Or is this one of those films where the bourgeois all pretend to think it is great, but it is not really? Well, that is too much build up for this film. Annie Hall is a fine film about two people that are just fine together, except that makes it too good to be true, so we will have to figure out something to go wrong. This is a humanist romantic comedy: intelligent, witty, insightful, etc. Well, it works just fine there. It is good cerebral entertainment, and is at times playfully surreal in an everyday way.

Life's A Movie,"If any one piece of work made Woody the chief target of ""Real Men Don't Eat Quiche"", this is it.Prior to this (as the 'actor') he played in the space between the movie reality and us - a territory upon which no one else 'in the movie' could trespass. He surrounded himself with characters who were oblivious to the satire, and the jokes centered on pinging away at the 'movie reality'.Here we have Woody 'playing himself' (under a pseudonym), which isn't really playing...he just ""is"" a bundle of neuroses, and that's enough. But the equation is completely rearranged. This time, Woody frames the movie with a performance to us; he plays within the movie to us; he draws characters from within the movie to join him in 'the movie in his head'; he shifts the narrative from present to past and back, at times for his past, at times for Keaton's 'past'; he plays within the movie to Keaton, which is the only thing resembling a 'story'. However, there's NO satire - every cultural target appears exactly as it really is. Taking the brunt of the hits are the New York intelligentsia, and later, the L.A. Sybarites. It's the rather ingenious multi-layered construction that makes this fly.This is the basis the of the entire ""Seinfeld"" series, and the launching pad for countless New York stories - e.g., ""When Harry Met Sally"".Novel, scattershot, mostly brilliant.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
I guess we all need the eggs,"Annie hall is Film-making at it's finest. Annie Hall has everything great cinema aspires to be. It is more than worthy of the 1977 Best Picture Academy Award. First Annie Hall had some of the finest cinematography i have seen in a long time. The simple beauty to the shots, to me at least, were amazing and enthralling. One of my favorite shots of all is towards the end of the film where it shows Annie and Alvy, yet we see them through a restaurant window, with the chairs up etc. To me this is pure brilliance, they could've have simply shot it straight-forward  but the fact that it was slightly obscurred by the surroundings is beautiful. Second the themes in the film were great. How we all need ""the eggs"" or rather love in our lives. Also how the one great love of our life might only last a few moments. Third the acting was great. Diane Keaton was more than worthy of her Best actor, and Allen playing his normal dysfunctional character was great. TOny roberts and Shelley Duvall were also great. And lastly, and to some most importantly the jokes. Throughout the film's glimpses into societal issues, and themes was the great Woody Allen jokes. THis is definetly one of his funniest films. I especially like the Joke ""I'm standing next to the cast of GOdfather here,"" at first we think he's referring to the two Italians near him, but then we realize it's really about diane keaton. 10/10 a must see for everyone and anyone, If you like this i would also advise seeing: Manhatten and Love and Death",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Can I ask you? Is this a sandwich?""","Woody Allen's professional integrity has held fast for over a quarter century. Commercial concerns have never deterred the artist from pushing through on a particular idea or project. It is well known that over the many years of filmmaking, he created an insular production company and connected himself to people (producers) who would accept any film proposal on face value - sometimes merely on the bases of one telephone conversation. This is not just a good film but a great film. Every scene has at least three to four gags that seem to never grow stale. When Alvie Singer (Woody Allen) meets Annie for the first time, she's obviously quite nervous and fills the pregnant silences with ""La ti da, la ti da..."" He says, ""I'm dating a woman who says, ""La ti da"". This reminded me of Seinfeld's famous, ""Yada yada yada..."" In and around all this, the film tells the story of a mismatched relationship between neurotic, intellectual New Yorker Alvy and Wisconsin transplant Annie Hall (Diane Keaton, in an excellent performance). The details of the relationship are delineated with aching realism: the tentative getting-to-know-you stage, the petulant break-ups, the warm making-ups, the mundanities (like getting rid of spiders in bathtubs), the arguments, the hilarious private moments that can't be repeated with anyone else (like their attempt to cook some lobsters), the boredom, and finally the wearing-out of the whole thing. This is all superbly done.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romantic Comedy at its finest,"Has there ever been a romantic comedy better than Annie Hall?  Has there ever been a better MOVIE better than Annie Hall?  One of the funniest, most honest, challeging, interesting movies I've seen.  And I never get tired of watching it.Woody Allen co-wrote, directed, and stars as Alvy Singer, a Jewish comedian living in New York City (Sound familiar?).  The film chronicles the years he spends with Annie Hall, a particularly long and important relationship in his life.  Jumping around in time, it presents the ""big picture"" of what it's like to be that guy, in that place, in that time.The film is very, very funny, one of Allen's funniest, and filled with lines that you laugh at once, then realize how smart they are and laugh again.  No one could really be that quick, but when it feels so good, go with it.  Alvy often breaks the fourth wall and talks directly to the camera, to great comic effect.  My favorite time he does it is when he argues with Annie about the phrase ""my wife.""But for all it's humor, Annie Hall offers some really telling insights into Allen's head.  The speaking directly to the camera only makes the story more intimate and personal.  Alvy, Annie, Max, they seem like real people not characters.  Everyone is relatable, and I can see a lot of myself in Alvy especially.Bittersweet but not sad, touching but not sappy, Annie Hall strikes note after perfect note.  I don't think I could ever get tired of it.  And I think it's a movie that most everybody should see.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Annie Hall summary,"Annie Hall directed by Woody Allen wasn't really an interesting movie to me. It was a very funny and very creative movie though. There was comedy throughout the whole movie that was really funny. He has a lot of dry humor that will make everyone laugh. He was very creative throughout the movie using many different techniques. In the beginning, he starts with him in front of the camera telling jokes to the audience. He talks about his life and all of it has nothing to do with the movie. Also in the beginning, he is in the classroom and he kisses the girl. His younger self goes up to the room while his older self sits in the desk and tries to defend him self. It was brilliant. At some points, he would stop the film and talk to the audience about what is happening. He also uses subtitles when he is talking to Annie on the balcony. She starts it off by being funny with him being Jewish. They are both talking to each other with subtitles underneath with words that they really wanted to say. It was brilliant and funny at the same time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"""You should be ashamed of yourself.""","This won best picture? Was I watching the right movie? All I would need to write to explain what I thought about Annie Hall would be ""Neurotic and tiresome."" But I guess I can try to stretch that out a bit.First of all, could Woody Allen have had a higher opinion of himself? You remember that ""What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation."" ""Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about."" part? That's the whole movie. Woody Allen's love letter to himself. It felt like he wanted to write a relateable version of himself but ended up just trying to convince the viewer that he's better than everyone else by explaining that all of his flaws just make him more genius. It began to physically hurt me every time he spoke. Stop stuttering, you weasel-person.Another thing that made me hate this irritating gremlin-man was his style of directing. Why did anyone like this? It was so disjointed, every scene just hurriedly chopped into the next like Allen's boney little arms were trying to force together two puzzle pieces that didn't quite fit. It had no cohesion, there was no flow to this movie. I guess he might have been trying to make the film feel neurotic like its protagonist? Even if that were the case, that just didn't work for me at all. It reminded me of my favorite film from this year, Birdman. That film was shot and presented like it was all done in one long shot, so it flowed together and the structure was relaxing. Annie Hall was the antithesis of that. Every transition felt like a collision. Maybe it was meant to represent Allen's use of the bumper cars to let out his frustrations. I think I've grown to hate this man on a personal level.Films are a great joy to me. I love watching movies. Usually, even if a movie turns out to be bad, I'll still enjoy the experience. There are a few exceptions to this, however. Annie Hall is one of those exceptions. This film brought me no joy, it provided no entertainment. It was a chore for me. If this film was a banana, my favorite fruit, it would be black and mushy, and I have no plans to make any banana bread, Woody Allen.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance

Greatest romantic comedy of all times!,"This is definitely the cutest and the most romantic(?) movie by Woody Allen. The movie is a beautiful comedy. Some radically new ideas (for a movie made in 1977): Woody suddenly speaking his mind into the camera, subtitled thoughts... Such a treat! Depiction of Californians - struggling to stay normal amidst mantras, meetings, and best of all, death rays; couples struggling to find an easy/convenient solutions to love, marriage and everything; foolish, phony, absurd conversations that happens between strangers-want-to-be-friends; making of sitcoms; Woody's driving skills, and defiance to authority... an endless list of screamingly hilarious scenes. Somewhere along the movie, amidst the sketches of phonies, you start smelling some amount of Catcher in the Rye. Woody, almost at the end of the movie, makes a reference to it, probably indicating it to be some sort of a source. Fresh as a daisy even today, Annie Hall is definitely one of the best movies ever made in Hollywood.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Weird Movie,I found this movie to be very confusing and hard to follow. There were parts that were humorous but I ultimately had a hard time grasping the plot. The cinematography was ultimately well done because I could see everything that I was supposed to on screen. Everything was well lit as well so I suppose you could say that the lighting made a difference. The sound including the background noise definitely helped to keep the audience interested at the very least and kind of gave the audience a clue as to what was happening in case they were a bit confused. I wouldn't recommenced this movie to anyone unless you feel that you will able to truly grasp the point and understand the intensity that is happening throughout the film.,4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Superb,"In my book, there are two types of great films. One type is in the class, of say, The Godfather. This type of film is technically maginificent, featuring superb performances, wonderful direction, a riveting story line and is effortlessly entertaining. There is another type of film, the type that Annie Hall fits into. This is the type of film which I call my ""favourite"" films. They may not be as technically proficient as ""the Best"" films ever made, but there's something to them which make them irresistible.Annie Hall, plotwise, is a pretty typical Woody Allen movie. It is a bittersweet romance between a balding, neurotic comedian (Woody Allen) and a sweet, if somewhat goofy (and younger), lady (Diane Keaton). The film focuses on their relationship from the time they meet taking the audience through some wonderful setpieces on the way. Annie's family is somewhat eccentric, for example, leading to a wonderful (and slightly Deer Hunter-esque) scene with Christopher Walken. The parties she attends are also something new for Alvin (Woody's character) leading to more moments of comic genius (an age old type of comedy- the comedy of manners- with a 1970s spin).Arguably Allen's best film, Annie Hall is immediately accessible to the non-Woody fan. His use of innovative techniques (for the 1970s) can be admired by even the most stern of critics- and used in conjunction with the wonderful performances and some of the funniest one-liners to have graced celluloid, Allen creates his masterpiece. Keaton is superb as Hall, obviously inspiring performances for female comediennes everywhere for years to comes (Phoebe's character from Friends, is a direct homage to Annie Hall). Allen's tried and tested neurosis is wonderfully appealing here melting even the coldest of hearts.In this reviewer's opinion, Annie Hall is one of the finest romcoms ever made, and certainly the most innovative. Even the uncharacteristic (for a romcom) ending feels upbeat and enriching. A film that cries out to be seen, Annie Hall holds a place in my heart- which is more than can be said about some of Allen's most recent work, or some of the pretender's to the throne of Annie Hall.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Variation from conventional romantic comedy,"Although this film has been proclaimed as one of the best romantic comedies, I see many distinctions between ""Annie Hall"" and the conventional romantic comedy. Conventional comedies are expected to end with the romanticized, ""happily ever after;"" like a fairy tale, where the two lovers end up together. The traditional narrative of romantic comedies involves: the introduction of characters the two protagonists (Alvie & Annie), the separation due to an argument or other contrived obstacle, and the ultimate reunion. ""Annie Hall"" is an example of a film that varies on this basic plot line, ruminating on the impossibility of love. Thematically and technically ""Annie Hall,"" is known as a major turning point in Allen's films. This film took a deeper emotional and romantic approach, while still maintaining his comedic style, though in a different way. ""Annie Hall"" was the first of Allen's films to utilize long takes, where one continuous, un-manipulated shot makes up the entire scene. Long shots have the capability of adding to the dramatic power of the film. Annie Hall's symmetrical yet non-linear narrative flows according to the emotional desires of one protagonist, Alvie Singer (who symbolized Allen himself). By spoiling the resolution in the beginning, the film invokes empathy in viewers as Alvie recounts his relationship with Annie, and self-deprecating revelations of self-doubt and absorption, paranoia, and intolerance/unacceptance of all things not including New York. Alvie's obsession with New York, its gradual decline, and outright hatred for California establishes the psychological setting of this film as a story of love amongst the ruins. Annie, on the other hand, is an anxious, skittish and scattered woman, whose flaws are also revealed in the film. Their imperfections make them charmingly human, emphatically drawing in the audience. It is very important to add another element in which ""Annie Hall"" does not follow the rules of conventions conventional romantic comedy or realism, known as ""Breaking the fourth wall."" The fourth wall is the boundary between fiction and the audience; when it is broken the character reveals his/her awareness to the audience, addressing the camera directly. Allen's use of split-screen imagery, double exposure, and subtitles expounding the characters' real thoughts also drifts further from realism. The film conforms its material to realism, however has the tendency to lean toward formalism. Allen chose to ""break the fourth wall"" because he felt that many viewers experience the same feelings and problems, and in this way he could confront them directly. ""Annie Hall"" was intended to appeal to viewers on the basis that they could relate. It was not meant to follow the classical romantic comedy, but instead focus on the anatomy of the relationship between Alvie and Annie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The first of Woody Allen's excellence that made Diane so naturally refined...,"I remember watching ""500 Days of Summer"" and commented how good, typical the story was. I posted some recollections watching the film here in IMDb and I recall one user commented ""watch Annie Hall"". Ironically I had the film before ""500 Days of Summer"" and the irony is that I first saw the latter than the former being owned first than the latter, so that's ironically confusing. Anyway I had Annie Hall before because I heard it was Diane Keaton's award winning film. After watching this film I never thought of smiling and recollecting most of the best scenes in the movie. While washing dishes it made me smile unknowingly how I recall they played tennis, quarrel over killing two spiders the size of a Buick, horribly driving a Beetle, toyed over scattered lobsters, and broke up and make it up. Seriously, Woody Allen had to be one of the brightest mind I've ever saw, no wonder he fished three Oscars for that brilliant talent! This is his second film I saw since ""Whatever Works"", though it should be noted that Annie Hall preceded it, well I'm a modern guy, I saw nowadays before classics, that's pretty normal. And Diane struck me like ever. She's so much better in this film, not only I saw her dashing archetypal beauty but her acting skills were so natural and refined. She indeed deserved the Oscar.I thought I would go weary watching films after 10 hours in the office, but I had the accidental choices I never thought would bring so much as an ""accident"".

While most romantic comedies portray relationships in a hardly believable, lame, fake Hollywood clichéd way, Annie Hall captures the highs and lows of a relationship in a serious and honest way, and relies on Woody Allen's wit for the comedy; including breaking the fourth wall to interject commentary, or sum up his feelings on what is happening in his life through a joke or anecdote.

Love or Friendship?,"Woody Allen and Diane Keaton give us a bird's eye view of some of the joys and many of the pitfalls of the journey love and friendship can take. The refreshing candidness early on in the film gives us a hint of it's virtues of honesty and openness. Using his rather unique style, Mr. Allen almost confiding in us, the audience, talks to us as if we are amateur therapists and I found myself responding internally at his plight. At the same time we are taken to a lighter place with these potentially heavy issues of love as they pertain to relationships. I almost get a sense that these are the very issues that he holds close to his own heart and life experience, so much so that it allows for a relationship with this dominant character, beyond the sweet love story he tells.

"""Polymorphously Perverse""....and One of the Best Romantic Comedies Ever","It's great to see how timeless this 1977 movie still is after nearly thirty years especially after seeing Woody Allen's more challenging later work in the interim. But nothing beats a perfectly written script (courtesy of Allen and frequent collaborator Marshall Brickman) and the undeniable chemistry between Allen and Diane Keaton in the title role. Scene for scene, it represents the most consistently engaging comedy Allen ever directed, and his wonderfully creative stream-of-consciousness narrative is filled to the brim with detours into flashbacks, animation, split-screens, fantasy scenes and speaking to the camera. It all blends into a movie that remains emotionally resonant and even bittersweet behind all the laughs.There is little plot to speak of as it focuses on the evolving relationship between Alvy Singer, a successful stand-up comedian, and Annie Hall, an aspiring singer. Interspersed throughout are episodes in Alvy's angst-driven life - his shaky childhood next to the Coney Island roller-coaster, his desultory days as a comedy writer, his previous failures in relationships and marriages, his ongoing resistance to the West Coast. No longer playing just the romantic loser of ""Play It Again, Sam"", Allen is constantly kvetching in his search for intellectual fulfillment but finally finds his first true love in his diametric opposite, an unaffected, self-deprecating girl from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. Their relationship is played out in clever episodes, none more so than their first meeting at a tennis game followed by Annie's reckless driving and a subtitled conversation on her terrace. It is really the contrast in their approach to life that brings them together and provides the impetus for their dissolution.Whether she is playing herself or not, Keaton is an unadulterated joy even as her character sadly grows apart from Alvy. Allen is himself or at least his public persona and even manages a sense of unexpected pathos toward the end, especially when he desperately proposes marriage at the health food restaurant. There are so many memorable moments that it's difficult to choose a favorite - Marshall McLuhan at the movies, the lobsters, the sneeze into the cocaine, Christopher Walken's bit as Annie's headlight-obsessed brother Duane. A movie as perfect as this deserves a deluxe DVD treatment, but the 2000 release has simply a decent print transfer and unfortunately only the original trailer as an extra. The title of my review was actually the phrase Alvy used to describe to Annie her bodily pleasure in lovemaking.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Because in about 2 days I could just watch 30 mins of the movie and because the movie, made me nervous, I am going to stop watching it and maybe later in a better mood I watch it again, I would have a different idea about the movie. The Film is much much omg I can not describe how it made me to feel I just want to stop it. I did not like it. Dislike",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
That was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.,"""That was the most fun I've ever had without laughing"" is just one of the witty lines from the 1977 comedy classic Annie Hall starring Woody Allen and Diane Keaton. Woody Allen pretty much plays himself (just disguised) as Alvy Singer, a surprisingly but successful but neurotic comedian. When he meets Annie Hall (Diane Keaton), a pot-smoking unsuccessful night club singer, his world changes. Although awkward at first (you have to see the famous subtitle scene  hilarious), their love turns into a bitter sweet romance with well-balanced chemistry. It's entirely realistic  definitely not a fairy-tale romance.This has made a significant impact on the film industry  Keaton's wardrobe alone (which were in fact her own clothes) started fashion trends. It was also very unusual in the use of techniques. It also discussed sexuality, fake intellectuality, Manhattan and death (all common themes in Allen's movies).I don't want to over analyze this movie  instead, I recommend you go out and rent it now. However, I will finally say that Annie Hall is a movie certainly not to be missed. There is hardly any space to catch your breath from laughing. Allen and Keaton are glorious in their roles, and as much I was laughing I couldn't help but reflect on the bittersweet nature of this movie. Hasn't dated at all. Just a fantastic movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
'romance in all its many insane stages...'.,"The more you watch this, the more you realize that nothing changes. Captures the absurdity of love and, as well, the heartbreak after it's over. So many pieces to this have been analyzed, it would be pointless to re-hash them. You either get them or you don't. Falling in love is as complex as it gets in life. And this has to rank right up near the top as one of the best relationship pictures ever made. The anger, bitterness, jealousy, frustration, manipulation, selfishness, wonder, awe, beauty; everything is shown and dissected with Allen's superb use of the ""cut up"" technique. Fragments all bunched together in different time frames and points of view. To make up a whole. The humor found here inevitably somehow always turns sad. It's the first of Woody's comedies that casually mixes the funny with the poignant, so you're left both choked up and amused. Probably his best cast, with a glowing Diane Keaton at her daffy infectious peak. A shame she had to be up against Marsha Mason in the Goodbye Girl the same year: 2 of the best female roles of the 70's.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
