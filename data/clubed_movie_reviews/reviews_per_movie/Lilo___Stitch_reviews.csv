One thing I've learnt while watching this movie-NEVER judge a film by its trailer!,"I don't know why the animators decided to use the ballroom scene from Beauty and the Beast to advertise the film. It did put me off seeing it, but when I eventually decided to do so, I am glad I did. I thought Lilo and Stitch a warm and entertaining film, with beautiful animation with the Hawiian coast. The characters were engaging and funny, especially Jumbaa(wonderful voice work from David Ogden Stiers, in fact all the voice work was terrific, the other standout being Tia Carrere) and Pleakley. Their scenes were hilarious, like Pleakley getting bitten by mosquitoes. This is all helped by a superb script, that mixes hilarious and poignant brilliantly. The music is lovely and quite nostalgic. I thought I would never say that, but it honestly does add to the sense of fun. Both Lilo and Stitch are engaging, and there are plenty of bonding scenes with them together, that makes the film often moving(I was genuinely touched by Lilo telling Stitch about her parents and the significance of the Ugly Duckling story). I have two criticisms with the movie, and they are that at times it is a bit slow, and the climax is a tad rushed. But both flaws are redeemed by the film's good nature, emotional heart and spirit. I will award Lilo and Stitch an 8/10, for entertainment and warmth. Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Gets Better And Better As The Film Goes On,"This was a pretty entertaining ""kids"" animated film. It was a little different in that there is some dramatic action you usually don't see in nice animated cartoons and you have heroes who aren't exactly good role models. However, as the film progresses, all those characters (small child, big sister and alien) all become nicer and more caring ""people."" There also is a good ""no one is left behind"" family message. You just have to be patient with the human kid and sister in the beginning.I think the best feature of this film are the brilliant colors. This is a great visual movie. It's also nice to hear a kids movie these days with absolutely no profanity in it. (What a sad statement to have to make.)In summary: one of the better modern-day animated films. Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I gave this movie another chance. I'm glad I did.,"First time, I commented how ""The Emperor's New Groove"" was my favorite Disney movie of the last ten years, and how ""Lilo & Stitch"" had left me wanting for more.How wrong I was then.I gave it another chance. I went back to watch it with a couple of friends and their sons and daughters. What best atmosphere to enjoy a Disney flick?And then, the scene were Stitch is alone, with ""The Ugly Duckling"" book, shouting ""I'm lost!"" (or at least that's what he was saying in spanish) made me change my mind. I suddenly became very identified with the main character's quest for belonging, and suddenly realized he was actually everyone I know - searching for approval, trying to be loved, longing for love. The watercolor drawings, the facial expression, the music, the mood - perfection, indeed. There are a couple of animated scenes that convey this kind of mood - the Ballroom Sequence in ""Beauty and the Beast"", Simba's dad being killed in ""The Lion King"", Jessie's song in ""Toy Story 2"" - and this one is one of the best I've ever seen. Such simplicity and beauty is strange to find.When we walked out of the movie, my friend's kids were talking excitedly about the movie, when one of their mothers asked them what they enjoyed most about the movie. And one of the girls exclaimed ""Ohana means family! And your family never forgets or abandons you!"" (that's what is said in the spanish version of the movie).Then I suddenly realized we need more movies like this.Solid 9 / 10 for Lilo & Stitch.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A very un-Disney-like Disney animation. And not in a bad way.,"""Lilo & Stitch"" is unusual for a Disney animated movie in that it actually seems to take place in the real world (not to mention the present day), despite the latter half of the title being a genetic creation from another galaxy. Devoid of almost everything that people come to expect when the name ""Walt Disney Pictures"" appears on screen - which is not to say we're in ""Golgo 13"" territory here - this, as did ""The Emperor's New Groove,"" suggests that though the box office takings may go down, the House of Mouse may yet pull another ""Beauty and the Beast"" on us one day.The movie's a breath of fresh air not only in its setting - it's set on the Hawaiian island of Kauai - but also in its characters; Lilo is a little girl being brought up by her big sister Nani following their parents' death (offscreen), and the movie's not afraid to indicate that it's tough for both of them. They, along with their social worker Cobra Bubbles and friend David, constitute a rare sighting of proper human beings in Disney cartoons (see also, surprisingly, Lucky Piquel from ""Bonkers""), the reward writer-directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois get for putting the emphasis on the emotions rather than on the chase element of the plot (Stitch/Experiment 626 was created by a scientist in violation of the laws of his planet; when Stitch escaped, his creator and an ""E-arth"" expert were sent to bring him back) or on the potential for slapstick - though it's there and it's certainly used, the focus is purely on heart.The realness of the movie means that ""Lilo & Stitch"" often feels like a live action movie that just happens to be drawn (at one point Stitch sees a 1950s SF movie on TV, and the movie in question is shown as a genuine film clip). Usually that's a bad thing if the 'toon in question strives to be realistic, but in this case there are so many elements that don't come naturally - seen any koala/dog hybrid-Elvis Presley wannabes on the beach lately? - that it still works. If there's a downside, it's that the scenes of the alien pursuers are for the most part almost a distraction... but even then the human element ups the involvement, with the added bonus of there being no real ""bad guys"" per se (yes, I said bonus - it's nice to see a Disney movie where there isn't a traditional black-hatted villain, just people doing their jobs).And if all else fails, take into consideration the fact that it's also often genuinely funny; the fact that it never condescends to its audience; the fact that you actually have real Hawaiians (the voices of Tia Carrere and Jason Scott Lee) as key Hawaiian characters; and the fact that the songs used here actually have a purpose (to add dimension to our heroes - Lilo is a major fan of Elvis and tries to reach Stitch through the King), something many live-action movies often forget. ""Lilo & Stitch"" would be something worth seeing even if it wasn't a Disney film; seeing that it is... moving forward was always one of Walt's credos. It's encouraging to see that they're actually capable of following his ethos without the help of Pixar.One major flaw though: in spite of the presence of Elvis, Wynonna and Alan Silvestri, the British release version has well-known song-murderer Gareth Gates slaughtering ""Suspicious Minds"" over the end credits. Thank heaven someone invented the ""mute"" button.",,Anonymous,Animation
A heart-warming story,"There is a little Hawaiian girl named Lilo, she enjoys diving, surfing and folk dancing. And she desperately wants a friend, even not just a friend, she wants to have a soul mate. A flying saucer crashes near her house and a strange creature emerges. Actually it is a hostile alien whose the only aim is to destroy life on earth. Their paths cross. What happens when the little earth girl and the extra-terrestrial maniac meet? A funny, heart-warming story of friendship, love, family ties To be frank I was not going to see this animated film considering it to be ""little kids stuff"". But when eventually I saw it I realized how wrong I was. Disney proves its reputation for making ""family friendly"" films because this is the film in which each family member, whether it be a child or a parent, can find something for him/herself to enjoy and think about. A couple of words about music. Since Lilo is a huge Elvis fan, the soundtrack contains a lot of his songs. It is a hard task to make songs written rather long ago fit in the modern film but the producers succeeded! Recommended to all!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's Most Underrated Animated Movie,"This is a personal favorite of mine, and I'm actually convinced it's Disney's most underrated animated movie. I guess the main reason I like this film so much is that it features the most sincere depiction of a relationship between siblings in any Disney film. For once, we get real, flawed (and therefore all the more lovable) people - not the usual perfect Disney princesses. But it's also incredibly funny and spectacularly entertaining throughout (not to mention that it has one of the most hilarious intros in any sci-fi film ever). I simply adore this movie, and I'm not ashamed to admit it makes me cry every time I watch it. This and Sanders' and DeBlois' other masterpiece, the first HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON, are the cinematic medicine that get me through my darkest days.The look of the film is very distinct and refreshingly different from Disney's previous animated features. And the visuals are gorgeous; the backgrounds are painted in beautifully faded watercolors, and the 2-D animation is an example of artists at the peak of their craft. Every scene is jock-full of original ideas and a virtual demonstration of Chris Sanders' and Dean DeBlois' seemingly limitless imagination (the film also features a ton of clever references to sci-fi and monster films). Simply one of the best animated films - and one of the funniest sci-fi comedies - of the last 20 years.P.S.

Not your ordinary puppy from the pound.,"A very entertaining animated comedy for the whole family. A little Hawaiian orphan girl named Lilo(Daveigh Chase)adopts a precocious ""pet"" that is actually an extra-terrestrial experiment known as 626 and soon to be named Stitch. Lilo's guardian is her sister(Tia Carrere)who his having troubles with the child welfare case worker(Ving Rahmes). Stitch has his own troubles being an alien creature on the run. Lilo shares with Stitch her obsession of Elvis Presley and several of the King's classic tunes are scattered throughout to keep the pace rolling. A very different kind of Disney film well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Is this a Disney movie???,"Project ""Six-Two-Six"" is deemed too dangerous by the ""Grand Council.""  A hideous genetic creation from the lab of mad-scientist ""Jumba,"" (David Ogden Stiers) project Six-Two-Six is put on board a space ship to be  banished to a nice little deserted asteroid, where he can live out the rest of his days. On the way there, project Six-Two-Six takes over the ship, and then escapes using what looks like a space squad car.  He eventually crash lands on one of the islands of Hawaii (Kauai?)  where a little five-year old orphan girl named ""Lilo"" (Daviegh Chase) finds him in a dog pound (don't ask) and takes him home as her new pet dog, ""Stitch"" (Chris Sanders).  Of course the Grand Council soon realizes what has happened, and sends agent ""Pleakley"" (Kevin McDonald) along with the mad-scientist to the island to recapture experiment Six-Two-Six.And so begins one of the most unusual and creative animated films from the Disney studios.  Featuring a completely new style of drawing, and backgrounds that look like watercolor paintings, Disney is taking a bold step in trying something a little different.  The artwork seems like a combination of ""Winnie-the-Pooh"" and Saturday morning cartoons.  The dialogue and slapstick comedy is much more reminiscent of Warner Brother's beloved ""Loony-Tunes."" Except for a handful of well chosen Elvis Presely songs, and some beautiful Hawaiian music, there are none of the musical numbers that one would expect to find in a typical Disney film.  (I, for one, didn't miss them.)We soon find out that Lilo is an orphan, living with her older sister Nani (Tia Carrere) in what could be comfortably called a ""dysfunctional"" household.  Nani is trying hard to make ends meet and be a mother to her young sister, who is having a very difficult time adjusting to life without her mom and dad.  The creators of the film do a superb job with the character of Lilo, making you identify with her loneliness and isolation without making it depressing.  They also very accurately portray the problems with an older sibling raising a younger, and the friction and fighting that results is typical of what one would find in this sort of arrangement.  The subject matter is very mature, but the animators do a fantastic job bringing it home to a level that small children can appreciate.Nani decides Lilo needs a dog to keep her company, so off to the kennel they go.  Lilo just falls in love with Stitch, the ""talking dog,"" and decides to take him for a pet.  It is with this most unlikely of characters that Lilo can find someone to confide in, to share her passions with (like Elvis), and to share the pain and sorrow that comes from being without parents.Stitch was created by the mad-scientist Jumba to be an evil little monster, but in the care of Lilo, he realizes his own aloneness, and his need for love and acceptance.  So the evil little alien allows Lilo to take him by the hand, dress him up as Elvis, and go surfing.   (Stitch's one weakness in the inability to swim, so for him to go surfing is a surprising concession to the little girl's whims.)   His original motive for being ""nice"" to Lilo was to avoid the agents sent to recapture him, but soon he realizes that Lilo and Nani mean more to him than just sanctuary.Disney makes a point in all their trailers and commercials to show Stitch as the Rodney Dangerfield of animated characters: he don't get any respect. Other than Lilo, everyone else in the film, including his creator Jumba, is trying to capture and/or kill him.  Even Lilo's sister finds several opportunities to take out her frustrations on the mixed-up little alien. At first, it's rather amusing, since Stitch is about the most obnoxious Disney character of all time, but after a while, you start feeling sorry for the little guy, and start hoping that he can find the love and acceptance he's longing for.I've often wondered why Disney's recent animated films cannot reach the level that Pixar's CGI creations do effortlessly (""Toy Story,"" ""Monsters Inc."").  Disney's cartoons seem dull and lifeless compared to the fun and action that Pixar delivers on a regular basis.   Well, it seems as if the Disney animators are finally being infected by some of the magic that comes from their computer animation partners.   ""Lilo & Stitch"" demonstrates that there is still some life left in that old art form that Walt made so famous many years ago. But more importantly, this little gem has a lot of heart.  You find yourself caring for the orphaned Lilo, you find yourself hoping that Stitch can fin d a place in a family, and you hope that big sister Nani can find a way to keep social worker ""Mr. Bubbles"" (Ving Rhames) from taking Lilo away to a foster home.There are some really big themes being tackled in this film, such as unconditional love, the need to belong to a group or community, self sacrifice, and family unity.   The animators handles all these extremely well, and you find yourself getting a lesson in philosophy as well as being entertained.   Yet the one theme that Disney pushes in all their advertising, and several times during the course of the film, is the oft repeated phrase: ""Ohana means family, and family means NO ONE gets left behind.""  This is a theme one finds emphasized in the recent combat films ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""We Were Soldiers,"" but isn't something you often find in a animated feature!  That one little phrase, ""no one gets left behind,"" has enough philosophical and theological weight to fill a college text book. It means that everyone, no matter what you may think of them, has value, and that there is no such thing an ""expendable"" person.    A better lesson for young children would be difficult to find.My rating: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Refreshingly different from the usual Disney fare,"Lilo is an orphaned Hawaiian girl who is brought up alone by her elder sister. They adopt a dog, Stitch which unknown to them, is actually a mutant alien accidentally landed on Earth and has been designed to destroy everything it touches.   Despite Stitch's genetic tendencies towards destruction, a bond forms between girl and alien while the scientist who created Stitch also arrives on Earth to capture him.Lilo is an adorable but rebellious little girl who loves Elvis.  Therefore, instead of characters bursting into song singing the usual Disney tunes, we get Elvis songs on the soundtrack which makes for a refreshing change. Stich is immediately unattractive, being a big-eared four armed monstrosity designed for destruction and creating havoc.  Like with Warner Brothers' Tasmanian Devil, it is down to the animation and characterisation which up the cute factor and allow for the audience to warm towards the alien.It seems like Disney have gone with the times, choosing to deal with the issue of a single parent family.  In doing so, they keep the right balance of sensitivity and compassion in the relationship between the two sisters without being sickeningly sentimental.As is often the case in animated features, part of the fun is to work out who the familiar voices belong to:  Lilo's older sister Nani is played by Tia Carrere and Jason Scott Lee plays Nani's friend who offers her a shoulder to cry on (and probably wants the friendship to develop into something more!)  Another character is the Ving Rhames-voiced social worker who oddly, is a big burly Man in Black type character.Chaotic action towards the end of the film is a little bit of a let-down after the fun of the relationship between Lilo and Stitch and inevitably, the ending is a sentimental and happy one.Overall, Lilo and Stitch' is good fun and will win over audiences both old and young through the story's originality and the characters' charm.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pure Magic,"I don't know why this film didn't do better at the box office. This is perhaps Disney's best animated film to date. It rivals anything by Pixar. Why? Very simple really and it's what Pixar keeps doing so well. They tell a good story filled with well developed characters. Not to mention the animation is excellent and the watercolor backgrounds beautiful. Watch it a second or third time just to look at these fantastic pieces of art! I hope Disney learns a lesson here (from DVD sales at least) that 2-D animation isn't dead if done right and Lilo & Stitch was done right. I purchased the DVD for my daughter, okay, for me too but she loves it and while only almost four, she gets the themes. (although it took her a while to understand Nani is Lilo's sister and not her mother). The special features are good. The Hawiian Children's Choir and Hula segments especially good. I liked the deleted scene feature and would like to see them added for a later release. Disney should have marketed this film better. I would have liked to have seen it on the big screen. Personally, I don't care for Disney as a company but if they keep producing work like this, I'll keep coming back.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Interesting Film,"I'm not really sure if I like this film or not.  There are definitely a lot of things that I do like about the film, but I'm just not sure if I really like the film as a whole or not.  This is definitely a kids movie, there's no question about that, but it seems odd to me that this film has a great deal of silly childish humor and at the same time has some more adult concepts and themes.The characters are all pretty cool, but I thought the origin of Stitch was really odd, and definitely not what I was expecting.  I thought he was just going to be an alien that somehow got stranded on earth, but it's not all that simple.  You'll just have to see the movie to know what I am talking about.Stitch and Captain Gantu were definitely the coolest looking aliens in the film and beautifully drawn.  The rest of the characters were fine, but just didn't strike me anything special.I guess I liked the movie, but I didn't think it was worth paying a full price ticket for.  If you are a Disney fan, then you should definitely see the film.  Otherwise, I'd probably suggest seeing the movie at matinee price.  I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading.-Chris",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is Disney at it's best. Honestly.,"""Lilo & Stitch"" tells the touching story of a lonely little Hawaiian girl, named Lilo, who meets and befriends Stitch, an escaped refugee alien who poses as a dog at the pound.I wasn't expecting much when it first came out, not being to interested in it. Well, after seeing it at the theater, I can now say it is Disney's best film. Ever. It's better than classics like ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Little Mermaid,"" both of which I adore. Many will not feel the same way as I do but I thought ""Lilo & Stitch"" was one of Disney's most inventive and involving scripts with fleshed-out and well-written characters.We are set in Hawaii, a tropical background that gives the movie a great feel. Setting it in Kansas, as originally planned, would not have had the same effect. The animation is simply beautiful, with pink fluffy clouds and wonderfully drawn characters.However, it's the story that ""Lilo & Stitch"" tells, along with many other great elements, that makes this film so outstanding. Not only is the film very funny (in fact, it's hilarious!) with pure moments of comic genius that can appeal to older audiences as well as kids, it's one of the most touching films I have ever seen. The whole middle of the movie is one that gives us spectacular scenes in a row that move me to tears each time.***SKIP THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH, TO AVOID MILD SPOILERS***I don't wanna say too much, but Nani's fight for custody of Lilo, tossed in with Stitch's touching character arc and search for the one place he does belong, and Lilo's loneliness, and a broken family, and cherished and beloved friendship with Stitch make this movie a surprisingly heartwarming and touching feature. One of the film's strengths is that it can be, at times, so sad.***END SPOILERS***The direction is solid, as is the animation. The water, and backdrop of Hawaii is desirable. The characters are developed, unlike most Disney classics, and lovable. You can identify with these characters and feel for them, and yes, Stitch does qualify in that category. His battered emotions, as well as the also adorable Lilo, are part of what makes this film so moving. This is an original, funny, and extremely heartwarming film that I highly recommend to families.""Lilo & Stitch"" was wonderful characters that I instantly fell in love with. More captivating than previous, sub-par Disney releases such as ""Hercules,"" ""Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" or ""Tarzan,"" this movie makes me laugh, cry, and moves me immensely. While it didn't break any new ground or anything, it thankfully returned audiences back to Disney's roots in terms of quality.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
3 stars (out of 4),"When we meet Lilo, a little Hawaiian girl, she is swimming and body surfing in the ocean, which she loves so much that she's late for a rehearsal of a hula dance. Soon thereafter we learn that she lives with her older sister Nani (voice by Tia Carrere, who really is from Hawaii), and that they don't always get along. Furthermore, a social worker incongruously named Cobra Bubbles (Ving Rhames) is suggesting that Lilo be taken away from Nani unless things get better real soon.Meanwhile, somewhere else in the universe, we meet Experiment 626 (who is later named Stitch, and whose voice is by one of the two directors). 626's mad scientist creator, Dr. Jumba Jookiba (David Ogden Stiers) has been put on trial for creating 626, a creature designed to be very powerful, intelligent, and dangerous. 626 is sentenced to exile, but escapes. And from the title of the film and the previews, you know that he ends up in Hawaii with Lilo.The animation here is very different from the computer generated films that are common these days, and more like the two dimensional animated films of years past. The backgrounds are often lovely watercolors, and most of the animation is also hand drawn from what I've read, although based on the credits there is also some computer animation.This is also not your usual Disney animated film, although it was made by Disney. Both Lilo and Stitch have some pretty objectionable habits, and the jokes target many pop culture icons. I heard that the film was made with much less detailed committee supervision than would usually be the case at Disney, in exchange for (as I recall) a smaller budget.The soundtrack is good, including Hawaiian music as well as a bountiful selection of Elvis Presley songs (six, I believe).The biggest downside to the film is that the message is a little too precious, although this is not a big complaint, and I found it less obnoxious than ""Ice Age"" in this regard. The basic message is one of family, whether or not that family is a traditional one with a mother and a father, or a makeshift one as we see in Lilo, Nani, and Stitch. The Hawaiian word ""ohana"" is used, which means more or less the same thing as ""family."" This is timely for me since we just became members of the Hawaii International Film Festival's Ohana in preparation for attending their film festival in November.This film is definitely recommended, even if you have no children. I originally gave it another half a star, so it's at the upper end of this rating. And I expect it to be a strong contender for the Academy Award for best animated film of 2002.Seen on 8/16/2002.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
What were they thinking?,"Lilo & Stitch is quite possibly (no strike that), IS the worst Disney animated film I have ever seen!!  It is just a bunch of video bites strung together - no plot, no point.  Ol' Walt must have been thinking, ""I gotta get back down there, it's falling apart.""I have seen most animated Disney pictures - the ones that came out when I was a kid and those that have come out since I became an adult, I can't remember any that are anywhere close to being this bad.

What would have happened if ET had been a belligerent life-form rather than a friendly one? That's the question Chris Sanders must have asked when he wrote the latest animated Disney movie Lilo and Stitch.,"The film, directed by Sanders who also provides the destructive alien Stitch's voice, is a very touching animated comedy which turns Steven Speilberg's original ET movie on its head. The plot revolves around little Lilo, a five-year-old  Hawaiian orphan, voiced by Daveigh Chase who unknowingly rescues an alien experiment from the dog pound thinking that she has rescued a dog. Her sister and guardian, Nani (Tia Carrere) is none-too-pleased due to his destructive tendencies, but is soon distracted by young surfie David Kawena (Jason Scott Lee). Unbeknown to Lilo the creature she names Stitch is actually experiment number 626 and has been designed to destroy all that he comes into contact with. Because of this Stitch is banished to  an asteroid for the rest of his life but escapes to a blue-green world known as earth. To help with this he has extra thick skin and has been given strength way beyond his means To make the story of family and friendship more alluring Stitch's creator, Dr. Jumba Jookiba voiced by David Ogden  Stiers, and the one-eyed Agent Peakley (Kevin McDonald) have a different idea. They are despatched by the Galactic Federation of Planets to capture Stitch and bring him home without interfering with the native humans. As the story unfolds Stitch learns what it is to be part of a family, albeit a very dysfunctional one, and feels like he belongs for the first time in his short life. As well as being loosely based on ET, in basic concept only, there are tips of the hat to the Star Trek television series as well as the Star Wars movies. The most obvious is when Stitch, imitating Jedi Master Yoda in Attack of the Clones, catches a laser blast in his hands, forms it into a ball and tosses it back at his attacker. Unlike most Disney films Lilo and Stitch has little music, save for the occasional clip of Elvis Presley which helps punctuate Lilo's obsession with the singer. Like Stuart Little 2,  Lilo and Stitch is packed full of family values and emphasises the importance of friendship. Hilariously touching.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Funny, Cute, Family-Friendly","This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time, and the best Disney movie since ALADDIN.  There's plenty here for the kids, but it gets a PG for good reasons, so parents, accompany your kids for this. And don't be surprised if you laugh, too, maybe harder than your kids do.Lilo is a tempermental 5-year-old being raised by her big sister Nani, who is constantly trying to keep social workers at bay and hang on to her job. Stitch is Experiment 626, a genetically-engineered destruction machine, bent on wreaking havoc and terrorizing big cities.  Thank goodness he lands on Kawai, a small island with small cities, and there is adopted by Lilo from the local animal shelter (he makes himself look like a dog).  The two bond instantly in much the same way toddlers bond into holy terrors when left alone together in playtime.  But along the way, Disney's familiar lessons of family triumphing over all play out in interesting and fun ways that your kids will love and you will even find yourself smiling knowingly over. There are too many clever allusions here to list:  MIB, Godzilla, tacky Polynesian tourist shows, Jaws, extreme surfers, and Blue Hawaii jump right out from the start and make things fun along the way.This is the movie that with virtually no hype beat out MINORITY REPORT at the box office on Friday, 21 June, and with good reason.

A surprisingly savvy movie,"I was disappointed with the comments of a previous reviewer called ebayanderson concerning this movie as I feel that he/she is not living in the real world. Lilo and Stitch is one of my favourite Disney movies as it covers so many topics and covers them well. Firstly, concerning Lilo's feeding the fish, well, all kids have little quirks and this is obviously meant to be her's. As for Nani being a care giver, well, she's supposed to be in her teens, dealing with her parents's loss as well as dealing with her sister's and taking care of the little girl under the pressure of keeping her family together, finding work etc. and it was nice as my 14 year old daughter pointed out, that Nani was like a real woman, with her little pot belly and not very stick thin build, for me she is a great character for little girls who have to put up with cartoon females such as the impossibly(pardon the pun)thin Kim Possible, which is sadly also a Disney cartoon girl. Actually, I tend not to look too deeply into movies unless they are there to make us do so, e.g Schindler's List, but, this movie covered some subjects that I am familiar with, a young child losing it's parents and it dealt with them well. The scene where Stitch takes the bicycle, well, how could anyone feel sorry for the little girl considering she is the monstrous brat in the movie. Anyway, I love the movie and I've watched it many times and am a hand on heart Stitch fan. Chris Sanders came up with an awesome character and he and Dean DuBlois did an excellent job in bringing him to life. they managed to make a movie that touched your heart with out being sickly or distressing a la Bambi. 10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney's back!,"Disney brings back watercolor backgrounds, not since 1941's Dumbo, in this stunningly-awesome looking animated movie. Even with that to boot, Dean Deblois and Chris Sanders managed to come up with a respectable plot that wasn't a complete rip off of E.T. (1982) or even, well, Mac and Me (1988). It's funny to see that the average person who doesn't enjoy any type of Disney production has been favoring this movie more than others, as I feel, it's a pretty nice step for the company. Disney goes flat-out to create a funny character put into a situation where only large laughs are going to occur. The Emperor's New Groove (2000) tried so hard to accomplish that, but fell just short of a home run. `Stitch' gets that extra foot or two.After being created by a mad scientist named Jumba (David Ogden Stiers), Stitch (Chris Sanders) is immediately set aside as a misfit and ordered to spend his life on a remote asteroid. After finding his way to a spacecraft, Stitch outruns the galactic police and crash lands in Hawaii, where is wounded and treated in an animal shelter as a dog. The following day, Lilo (Daveigh Chase), a lonely and misunderstood young girl, arrives at the shelter to adopt a dog after her sister Nani (Tia Carrere) allows her to.Along with the frustrating social worker Mr. Bubbles (Ving Rhames), Stitch proves to be too much for the sisterly duo. Their own relationship, scarred by the death of their parents, starts to fall apart. Lilo feels that Stitch is the only one who understands her, her sister just doesn't respect her anymore, and her peers don't seem to be accepting her at all. Two relationships in this movie are key, with Lilo & Stitch and Lilo & Nani. Acting as the stronger point, Lilo helps transform Stitch and Nani into different people with different priorities, the main one being family.`Ohana,' which means `family,' seems to be one of the largest elements in this film. Being referenced numerous times by Lilo throughout the film, it eventually starts to grow onto Nani and Stitch, until they use it themselves by the end of the film to  well, you'll have to see it for yourselves. Reading some user comments on the film, it seems that most Hawaiians are glad that the message of `ohana' is being used, and the meaning is becoming known a little better. It's almost like if people in Japan made a movie and had the main character say `Yeah baby, yeah!' dozens upon dozens of times. It represents our great culture, so it feels good to let others know about it.The comic character is there, the sappy child-left-behind character is there, the setting is there. Everything seems to be `there' for this really un-sappy (besides a few short moments) cartoon. Oh, and did I mention that this one is awesome enough to contain no please-cry-because-I'm-lonely songs sung by the characters? Just some good ole' fashioned Elvis playing. Even without the tunes, this movie would still be rock n' rollin'.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Funniest thing Disney's done in a long time.,"This is a great little movie.  It has the right mix of comedy, drama, and tear-jerking.  The characters are interesting and very well done.  The animation is high quality.  The setting is fairly unique.  I have to say, Disney's animation people can do something besides make bad sequels after all.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
An unusually good Disney movie,"Lately Disney seem to have had quite allot of trouble, coming up with innovative story's for their pictures, recreating folk-lore such as Mulan, Brother bear and other titles. Not to mention their pathetic sequels & ""new exclusive editions"" that've been clogging up the shelves at your local rental store. This movie however came as a pleasant surprise from Disney. Not only did it have the typical ""Disney- awwwwwww!"" feature, but also an unusual dosage of satire and ""evil-deeds"" from the cute little blue alien Stitch.This is probably one of my new favorite Disney-flicks, mostly because of the charming way the whole picture is drawn, and the evil little creature Stitch!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Oasis in the Middle of a Desert,"Disney's animation department (until the purchase of Pixar) had, to tell the truth, fallen into a bit of a dark age as the 90s drew to a close. The films were getting muddled with executive desires, and as a result went ridiculously over budget, and needless to say ultimately often bombing at the box office and/or with critics as a consequence. Only the Pixar films and, to a lesser extent, DTV sequels (themselves not exactly the brightest bulbs in the chandelier) were really the only new animated films from Disney that were making money. Whilst a number of Disney's animated films of the early 2000s are fine (""Home on the Range"" and ""Brother Bear"" are, in particular, both fun flicks), they certainly don't quite live up to the best of Disney animation.And then there's ""Chicken Little"". I wanted to like it, but I was left really disappointed. It had nice animation, but executive meddling had left the story in a mess. I'm a fan of Zach Braff and Harry Shearer, but even their vocal talents didn't save this film, which resulted in the worst Disney film of all time, and was probably only a hit due to the sheer mountain of advertising.And yet, there's always an oasis in the middle of a desert, and ""Lilo and Stitch"" is, in this case, just that. It's the story of a girl who mistakes an alien for a dog, and whilst seeming an unusual little flick, is unpretentious. The animation differs from the classic Disney style that many may be used to, but it's delicious eye candy. It's rather touching, too and was rightfully a hit with critics and at the box office. Director Chris Sanders is directing another animated film for Disney entitled ""American Dog"" and should be released in 2008. Hopefully that will be just as good.Although it was rated PG in the USA, I honestly think that most young kids will be able to take this if they survived the likes of ""The Lion King"", ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Dumbo"". But enough with the kids, and onto the adults; seriously, don't dub this as a kids movie because it's made by Disney. It's got something for everybody in it and I recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Works better than it should,"Disney, the King of Film Animation. Well, it was at one point. Now Dreamworks is giving them a run for their money, but never mind. This is a Disney movie, although the film has taken its competitor's taste for the irreverent and mixed it with its own Disney heart.Stitch is a monster created by the ""mad scientist"" Dr. Jumba (Disney animation regular David Ogden Stiers). But because such experimentation is illegal (and Stitch is engineered to be a complete menace), Jumba is arrested and Stitch is ordered into exile. But clever Stitch escapes to Earth, and Jumba and another alien, Pleakly (Kevin McDonald) are sent to bring him back. Meanwhile, Stitch gets adopted by a little girl named Lilo (Daveigh Chase), who after the death of her parents, is being raised by her older sister, Nani (Tia Careere). But while the inclusion of Stitch into the picture may have been made with good intentions, he may end up causing enough trouble to get Lilo taken away to an orphanage.The voice actors are good. Daveigh Chase is excellent as the shy and awkward little girl. She wants friends, but she lacks the appropriate social skills (it doesn't help that the other girls treat her like crap). Tia Careere, whose career has been in a rut despite being in one of my all-time favorite movies (""True Lies""), is great as Nani. They may drive each other nuts, but Nani really cares about her sister. David Ogden Stiers is suitably kooky as Dr. Jumba, while Kevin McDonald equals him as the neurotic PETA-clone (some may find his vocalization annoying though).The problem with the film is that we really come to care about Lilo and Nani. Any time Stitch wreaks havoc (which he frequently does), it is at the expense of Lilo and Nani's shaky stability. His hilarious chaos makes their life harder, and the movie struggles to find a balance between the two. Also, the animation is sub-par, especially when compared to the likes of the previous animated films Disney brought us.That being said, ""Lilo and Stitch"" is still a lot of fun for the whole family.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney Bites Back,"Yes, it's a sad fact that Disney, the family favourite for close to a century, have fallen into decline. All the same, it annoys me no end when people go on about how 'The Lion King' of 1994 was the last truly great film that the company produced, because, in their period of decline and lack of success, the House of Mouse still surprised us all by churning out one cracking exception - the sassy and heartwarming 'Lilo and Stitch'.In the Stitch of the title (and face it, he may have shared his title logo with Lilo but Stitch has always been the undisputed star of this empire) it really feels like Disney have found that very likable and very different kind of hero to break them out of their rut. To begin with at least, he has none of the noble or high moral qualities that Disney usually attributes to its lead characters. And the circumstances in which he comes about are, for a family film, startling - the result of an illegal extra-terrestrial experiment to produce a creature that is both destructive and indestructible. When Stitch finds himself seized by the Intergalactic Council to be punished for his inbuilt wickedness, he escapes - it wouldn't be much of a movie if he didn't - and flees to planet Earth, with the alien authorities in hot pursuit. Though the film's anarchic spirit owes a fair bit more to 80s creature films like 'Gremlins' and 'Critters', I suppose you could look at it as a inversion on the plot of 'ET', in which, this time round, the humans are harmless and it's his fellow aliens who pose greater threat to Stitch.Finding himself stranded on Hawaii, our little anti-hero has no choice but to disguise himself as a dog and take refuge with Lilo. Lilo being a lonely young orphan living with her older sister Nani, and who may be taken away in a matter of days if Nani doesn't prove herself to be a more responsible guardian. The merging of these two very troubling story lines shows a lot of tenaciousness on Disney's part and in the end they produce a film that is fun and funky enough for the younger audiences, but also heartwrenching enough to touch even the most cynical of adults. It's also helped by a good line secondary characters, the most successful of which are Jumba and Cobra Bubbles, because, like Stitch, they're unconventional in the roles they fulfil. Jumba is an evil genius with a heart. Bubbles is a social worker who, fittingly since he's voiced by Ving Rhames, looks like he walked straight out of 'Pulp Fiction'.It ain't perfect though. Considering that Stitch is one of Disney's most engaging heroes, it really blows that Gantu should have to be one of the stuido's flatter villains. He isn't drawn very well and he isn't developed as a character much further than being ruthless and bad-tempered. There is also one pretty big plot-hole that older viewers may be troubled by - if that lady at the pound really thought that Stitch was dead, why did she put him in with the dogs? And wasn't she alarmed by his six legs and his antennae?It may be flawed, but in the end it's the merits that triumph. And it's a good example of just how dazzling 2D animation can be when given the right attention to detail. Once you get past the pretty pale opening scenes in outer space and enter the world that Lilo inhabits, visually this is beautiful stuff, employing the technique of watercolour backgrounds for the first time in decades. And the soundtrack too is one of the most memorable in Disney's canon. I believe this is the first time they've based its score around the pre-existing songs of a familiar artist - in this case the immortal Elvis Presley. Needless to say, it's great music.(Sadly, we also had to tolerate the likes of Gareth Gates and A Teens doing sugary covers over the end credits, but at this stage you can always switch off or leave the cinema.)Too bad that Disney are now really on the wane, or they could have tried doing these themed soundtracks more often with the Beatles and Pink Floyd...oh well, I can dream.To sum up, Stitch is the best. Watch him.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good Character Development art and Music, plot is O.K.","I liked this film, but I'm very partial to good character development. I especially liked the portrayal of Lilo (a traumatized orphan) and her big sister, Nani.  If you may want to watch the movie with your child if they are young, since kids can be susceptible to fears of abandonment The other central figure, Stitch is comical and appears to be intelligent.  The animation, choice of music and gags in the movie were also good.  The plot was a little weak (especially the second half of the movie).  I rated this 7 out of 10, I'll be looking for more work from Sanders and DeBlois (the writers). Perhaps if Disney could leave a few loose ends or avoid forcing every story to an almost predictable happy ending, then the real skill of these writers might shine through.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Absolutely horrible,"""Lilo and Stitch"" has my vote as being the worst animation movie I have ever seen. It is violent, tasteless,  inappropriate for children, unfunny, uninteresting and terribly disconnected. It is unclear to me what on earth might have been the purpose of making this movie (other than profit ) from a company with past glorious reputation in animated movies. The story line centers around an alien fugitive beast in Hawaii which is being hunted by alien monsters of various kinds. Throughout the entire movie, I could not hear any of the 20 or so children in the theater making any expression of laughter,  delight, or joy but were rather perplexed (as I was) that how they were duped into watching such a senseless story.  The opening credits site the movie was based on ""an idea by Chris Sanders"". One may wish Mr. Sanders would keep his ideas to himself in future.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"After a Long Time, Disney Gives Us Another Gem?","It feels like ages since Disney gifted us with numerous gems like 'Bambi', 'The Little Mermaid', 'The Lion King' etc (to name only a few) but things haven't been going too well for them in the last 20ish years. The other day I saw 'Tarzan and Jane' and I was mortified at how awful it was. Not just in term of its content, but even the animation looked very amateur. 'Lilo and Stitch' is a gem to have emerged from Disney after a long long time. Sadly, Disney has gone back to churning the usual crap and the success of trash like 'High School Musical' can assure us that we cannot expect anything great from Disney for a while longer.'Lilo and Stitch' presents a very new style of animation with a new story. The characters, setting and music are all very refreshing. It's quite a nice touch of Disney to reintroduce Elvis to the younger generation. I loved most of the songs including Wynonna's version of 'Burning Love'. the only song i hated was A-Teens version of 'Fools Rush In'. Those bitches totally ruin that song. I didn't listen to the rest of the songs during the end credits but i hear that those too have been ruined by non-talents of the current-day. The setting in Hawaii is beautiful. I know it's only animation but it makes one want to go live there. The Hawaiian culture is very nicely portrayed.The characters are very unique, real and lovable. We can recognize the little brat we once were in Lilo. She's a brat and gives her sister one hell of a time but also has a soft spot. She clearly loves her sister and is pretty much a lonely child. The sisters relationship was very real. Nani is pretty much the sole guardian struggling to make a living and raise her sister. This was also another point that 'Lilo and Stitch' lightly tackle, real life situations where an elder sister is trying to be a good parent to her little sis while she is also threatened by a social worker and tries to balance her worklife and life at home (which is clearly dysfunctional). At the same time we also see that she hardly has time for any romantic relationships. Stitch is one of the most unique characters of a Disney film. He is pretty much like an outsider who doesn't get along with anyone in the beginning, mostly through faults of his own but gradually forms a close bond with Lilo and Nani (kind of like me when I was a teen except that instead of Lilo and Nani I had a few good friends). The voice cast (that includes names like Tia Carrere, David Ogden Stiers Ving Rhames and even Chris Sanders who created the film) do a fine job giving life to their characters.'Lilo & Stitch' is sheer entertainment. It tackles some relevant themes such as family value, the need to belong and unconditional love but it is well handled and doesn't do it in a way that will bore the kids. It's as much a movie for kids as it is for adults. It all started with Chris Sanders's (who also dubbed for Stitch) idea and he deserves full credit for it. Just think of the beautiful line often repeated in the film. 'Ohana means family, and family means NO ONE gets left behind'. Simple words yet such a powerful line. And it's coming from a Disney film. A real gem indeed.",,Anonymous,Animation
Not your typical Disney animation but still great,"There are certain things one expects from classic Disney; beautiful princesses, handsome princes and characters who regularly break into song... one doesn't expect malevolent, genetically engineered alien creatures coming to Earth and befriending a girl who bites and punches her friends; that is what we get here though!Lilo is an orphaned Hawaiian girl who lives with her sister, Nani; she is a real handful and social services are investigating to see if she should be taken into care. 'Experiment 262' is the alien creature that crashes to earth and is mistaken for a dog; it is taken to the pound and adopted by Lilo, who names him Stitch. At first he just sees her as something to put between himself and the two aliens sent to recover him but gradually they become friends and learns about 'ohana'; the Hawaiian family ideal. As the story progresses Stitch may cause trouble for Lilo and Nani but not through the deliberate malice he was designed for.I must say this film was nothing like I expected... and it was all the better for that. I loved the fact that neither Lilo nor Stitch felt like typical Disney protagonists. Both characters get great introductions before being brought together. Their relationship develops well providing plenty of laughs. There are also many thrilling moments, but nothing too intense, as other aliens try to retrieve Stitch. The main pair after him are funny and even though one of them is the 'mad scientist' who created Stitch they don't come across as too unpleasant for younger viewers. While characters don't break out in song effective use is made of Lilo's love of Elvis's music. I really liked the modern Hawaiian setting; it made the human characters feel more real than those in most Disney cartoon. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of animation, whatever their age, who enjoy a good mix of humour and action.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Disney, mainly like we know it.","Rating: U Stars:  Ving Rhames is the biggest name Theme:  Disney - says it all Language/Nudity/Violence:  comedy violence""Ohana means family... family means, nobody gets left behind, or forgotten""Yep, Disney has taken its family values and shoved them further down your throat than ever before.  The central message is the importance of family, no matter who you are or where you come from.  Lilo lives with and is cared for by her older sister, Nani, in Hawaii.  Stitch is an intergalactic killing machine who crash lands on aforementioned island.  After some typical Disney confusion and comedy timing (and some blind ignorance from the people running the dog pound), Lilo adopts Stitch. Cue the hilarity.At least, cue the chuckles.  There are a few moments of laugh out loud humour, but generally its smile raising and appreciative giggles all the way.  The story itself isn't classic Disney, which is refreshing.  And the characters aren't typical beautiful Disney faces.  The women in the movie all have the kind of thighs that a New Zealand winger would be proud of and all the human characters have flattened Hawaiian noses.  Of course they are all cute, those animators aren't completely stupid.  Stitch himself is even quite loveable, despite being in need of serious orthodontic care.  And the setting lends itself to images vibrant with bright full colours, classic Disney more like Aladdin than Beauty and the Beast.The animation itself harks back to classic Disney.  Perspective is considered greater than flashier effects.  The mind blowing three dimensional animation of Beauty and the Beast or Mulan isn't apparent for most of the movie.  It is used carefully to separate worlds and to add to the narrative the notion of differences and colliding cultures.  In fact it was the intelligence with which the movie was created which impresses more than the movie itself.  The prologue, set in a space craft and modern in its animation style, contrasts with the classic animation of the Earth scenes. On the few occasions when space craft are seen flying around Earth, the animation switches back to the modern rendering.  The perspective on Earth is that the viewer is looking up to everyone (which may explain the thighs). The only characters we can see eye to eye are Lilo and Stitch themselves - we are one of them, one of the family.This is not the greatest Disney movie ever released, but its not the worst. It will probably spawn a snatch of straight to video sequels and make a fortune in merchandising this Christmas.  It will also earn many a boyfriend out there some extra brownie points as well.  This is a pleasant enough Disney film that won't offend anyone and won't seem like 90 minutes of your life wasted.  But don't expect a life changing experience, or even to spend too much time thinking about the film after you leave the cinema.

As good as animation ever gets,"If we're STILL hearing idiotic comments about the Disney ""formula"" after this, I think I'll scream. Just so I'll know, which Disney cartoon, exactly, is representative of the formula which the rest allegedly follow? Certainly not the last, say, five, which show an astonishing amount of daring and have nothing whatever in common with one another: ""Tarzan"", ""Fantasia 2000"", ""The Emperor's New Groove"", ""Atlantis"", ""Lilo and Stitch"". True, two of those five (""Fantasia 2000"" and ""Atlantis"") are total misfires, but two others are of transcendent quality: ""The Emperor's New Groove"" and ""Lilo and Stitch"". And ""Lilo and Stitch"" turned out, to my surprise, to be even better than ""The Emperor's New Groove"" - and what's more, even funnier. (It's even more surprising because the prologue before the main title, a meeting of the Alien High Council, suggests something generic and ordinary - but thereafter, every single moment is solid gold.) At least half of the humour, as it should, comes from the animation: the way Stitch is drawn, the way he moves, the strength of the characters' attitudes and, ultimately, the depth of their emotions.The animation is (after the disappointing ""Atlantis"") of the highest Disney standard; the art direction is fresh and lovely (the backgrounds are in watercolour, for the first time in decades); and the minimal computer animation is used tastefully and correctly - there is NOT ONE garish mismatch between, say, a CGI spaceship and a pencil-animated human. The characters feel unique and even the child, Lilo - ESPECIALLY the child, Lilo - is endearing. The strong sentiment towards the end is not manipulative or false, but grows naturally out of the comic premise.  There can be no doubt: this is a GREAT movie.One thing I will hear occasionally that will also make me want to scream is the critical kiss-of-death: ""Lilo and Stitch"" is ""good for children"". This is perhaps the most misleading thing a reviewer can say. It's GOOD, period. I don't know what particular demographics - children, adults, Hawaiians - will most admire the film, and I don't care.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Mixed Outcome,"One of the weirder Disney concepts: a genetically-mutated alien bent on destruction escapes to Earth, where he's adopted (as a dog) by a pair of orphaned sisters struggling to keep their family together. The younger sister, Lilo, is a friendless misfit, given to acting out rages stemming from parental abandonment and the bond she forms with her antisocial pet, Stitch, is natural, helping bind the family into a self-sufficient unit. (Her sister Nani's boyfriend David ultimately completes the set.) Perhaps the film's most interesting selling point is the elongated time it takes for the audience to develop affection for the characters; upfront, both Lilo and Stitch are maliciously irascible and the sentimental notions of family don't always seem to fit. (And the idea of Stitch's having no past--and thus no concept of family--due to his genetic engineering seems forced and oddly foreign.) But there are so many good absurdist comedy bits in writer/directors Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders' script that it's a relief when it loses its focus; when it doesn't have to be so ploddingly serious, it's very entertaining indeed. The setting is Hawaii, which means there are plenty of sunny color schemes in the animation; unfortunately, it's some of Disney's least interesting animation in years. The original songs by Mark Keali'i Ho'omalu are just as boring. But the tribute to Elvis Presley that serves as both a running joke and running commentary is a delightful stroke of genius and proves that Disney still has the chops to be the hippest animation team in the business.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Either way you turn it, Lilo & Stitch is a keeper. They truly don't make them like this anymore","2002 may seem a long time ago now, but in fact only 5 years have passed since then. Back at the time, I was a 21 year old soldier, serving my third and last year of obligatory service in the Israeli army, counting the days left until I could be a civilian again. Anyway, I remember coming home one Friday after two weeks at the army, and I was all tired and worn out. Luckily enough, my ex-Girlfriend (we just started dating at the time) insisted we go out for dinner and a movie. I could still taste the gourmet meal I ate, and smell the popcorn that greeted me upon entering the theater. Needless to say, I wasn't the film buff I am now back then, and I entered Lilo & Stitch without any previous knowledge about what to expect.After all this time, I still don't know if it was the whole atmosphere of the brief vacation from the army or the fact it was an over the top animated masterpiece from the get go. As anyone would tell you from personal experience, it's all subjective anyway. Fact of the matter is, I instantly fell in love with the film and its lovable characters. The story of an alien being (cute and cuddly as he may be) who is stranded in a place miles away from home made me relate to my own personal status, having to serve in the hot and humid southwest area of Israel, hundreds of kilometers from my own home. Once I was there, feeling for the ridiculous looking Stitch, I soon developed a gradual empathy to Lilo, the little girl who adopted Stitch after mistaking him for a dog, as I myself am an orphan, and I can see why she needed a dog to share her emotions.Now mix all this with the hilarious animation, numerous likable side characters, beautiful Hawaiian setting, refined Elvis Priestly soundtrack, and you got yourself a winner. Lilo & Stitch manages to be silly and intelligent both at once, and to this day makes me laugh and cry simultaneously (I obviously own it on DVD). It's the last traditional animation outing that was a big hit at the box office as well (if memory serves me right, it earned nearly 150 million dollars in the US alone), and there's an obvious reason for that. Like Shrek 1&2, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo and other 3-D CGI animation films, it keeps its plot simple and easy to follow, when all the while manages to pay gestures to older films and themes us grown ups can relate to; thus really living up to the cliché that insists a G rating is for everyone from 4 to 90 9or something like that).As you can tell, I first and foremost fell in love with this film for sentimental reasons, but at the end of the day, what made me watch it again and again over time was its original mix of Sci-fi and traditional animation, unbelievable funny scenes (try watching Stitch running over the toy model of San Francisco and tell me you didn't laugh) and simple morals of family and friendship. Either way you turn it, Lilo & Stitch is a keeper. They truly don't make them like this anymore.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Gut wrenchingly funny, heart warmingly beautiful.","As soon as I saw the teaser trailers featuring the main character gate-crashing some of the more staid and sickly Disney movies (hello Beauty and the Beast/Aladdin), I had a feeling that I was in for something at least a little different to the standard Disney formula. What I ended up with when I saw it was a splitting headache and sore stomach muscles. It is without doubt the most original and hilarious animated feature I have ever seen. Funnier and more emotionally engaging than Shrek and the Toy Story's put together, there are no obvious jokes in Lilo and Stitch and no forced comedy from so called 'a-list' stars. What there is however, is excellent dialogue, beautifully strange painting/drawing, a simple genuine message and ridiculously funny slapstick as a result of the diminutive Stitch's special alien powers. While never really feeling like a 'Disney' movie, it reminded me more of the humour I love from TV programmes like The Simpsons.

a change from the pace,"I had the chance to see Lilo and Stitch at a ""Surprise"" Sneak Preview ( without prior warning ) - and laughed my head off.This is NOT standard Disney ""sweeter-than-Cotton-candy"" fare - even more so than the surprisingly good ""the Emperor's New Groove"" it takes a rather anarchistic humour and comic hyperbole, stirs, shakes and twirls it to a new degree of potency and serves them with a flourish.As for the story - an escaped, genetically enhanced lifeform programmed for the wholesale destruction of cities and with a keen sense of survival and cute blue fur ) escapes from its creators, its jailors and the whole of the ""united-galactic-whatever"" and gets stranded in............. Hawaii. Here it gets adopted/picked up by child-terror Lilo, the bane of her older sister, her playmates and the general sanity of the pacific island. On its trail - the mad alien scientist and a fumbling galactic bureaucrat concerned with the safety of the local wildlife - humans and other ""sucky"" species...... A perfect setting for large scale chaos, groovy scenes ( in two words - ""Elvis lives"" ) and much less than expected emotional, family values scenes.As for the technical side - the animation is not especially outstanding, the backdrops at some times unbelievably ""kitschy"" and very little computer animation visible (though I do have some suspicions, they do not distract/jar with the conventional animation ), colours stay themed and the soundeffects are cool. Oh, did I mention, there was hardly any singing ? THERE IS HARDLY ANY SINGING ! Thanks Disney, you are finally getting the clue ! Now keep up the good work............There is little of the ""sweet and furry"" and ""perfect family"" stuff which used to be almost a Disney trademark , but when some ""touchy"" scenes come deep out of left field, they are even more poignant for it. Real life problems like broken families, unemployment and child care by single parents are presented in an unobstrusive and ""simplified for children"" way and add motivation to the characters without dominatiing the plot. Adults will get a series of laughs out of subtle (MIB, Godzilla, Star Trek etc.) and less than subtle ( Elvis ) references, with big orgies of comic destruction and some fun science fiction gadgets helping out. Basically everyone in the theater walked out with a big and wicked grin (although they were all adults due to it being a sneak preview, I do have a fair suspicion how my six year old nephew is gonna like this movie....). This is a family movie in the best ""take everyone, and have them enjoy themselves together"" sense , as well as flick that one can simply go and enjoy as an adult (ok, one with a sense of anarchistic humour ).",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The worst animated film ever made by anyone, ever!","Ever since I was young, I have always loved going to see Disney films at the cinema. Some have been incredible - Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, The Emporer's New Groove. Some have been very good - Hercules, Mulan, Tarzan. Some have been okay - Atlantis, Treasure Planet, Brother Bear. Some have been not very good (like Hunchback and Pocahontas) but with them, at least I could still sit through them without being offended or appauled. This is what I felt when I went to see Lilo and Stitch, and the brilliant ad campaign promised so much ...There are dozens, even hundreds of things wrong with this film, and one thing right with it - Elvis songs.Bad things ...All the characters have the potential to be funny, but they either choose the wrong things to say, or say them the wrong way or in the wrong accent - this makes nearly every line painful to watch, and makes you want to kill the characters. And I mean that.It's badly written - choppy, inconsistant plot, stupid dialouge (that bit at the begining when Lilo says something about her fish predicting the weather - what the hell was that!? I have never heard such an awkward silence in a cinema before.) Everything is twisted (not gracefully) to be about families, and worst of all, the characters are incredibly cruel to each other (for laughs, I felt) and never really turn around until the last two minutes. I thought these were flaws that were so blatant everyone would notice them. The little movie critic that lives in my head was screaming bloody murder.Lilo is the worst child I have ever seen - she beats people up, (One of the most disturbing parts is when Stitch & Lilo shove a little girl off her tricycle and take off with it, leaving the little girl sobbing in the dirt. If you think that's funny, you have some serious mental problems.) She's annoying, she nails herself into rooms saying ""leave me to die"" (am I crazy, or is that not appropriate for a children's film?) She's annoyingly designed and voiced. You never, EVER feel ANY sympathy for her at all. I kept hoping this movie would have a happy ending in which Stitch would redeem himslef by doing the world a favour and rip Lilo in half like a phone book.Nani is the worst care giver ever, and the family situation was a horrible scenario. The worst bit was when she's locked out and they're insulting each other ""I'm going to kill you"" ect. and then later they act like the closest of friends. Absolutely appauling! This film also has THE most blatantly saccharine family values quote ever ""Family means no one is left behind"" - not so much cheesy, as a chain of cheese shops, which just may have been ignorable had the characters had any sort of believable familile bond. But they didn't, which brought the film down several more notches.Stitch is terrible, a destructive brat who (everytime we just about feel sympathy for him) blows up a house and starts off from square one. Annoyingly voiced and desgined (as pretty much everything is in this film) and with the huge plot hole (if he's adverse to water, why does he come into contact with it ALL THE TIME and live?) Well done, writers.The aliens ... don't get me started on how annoying they were. No sense of good comiedic timing or delivery (or writing for that matter). Add to this, an ending which was stupid, forced, and convientley didn't make sense but tied thngs up. I have never left the cinema so disspointed. More than that, I felty angry that Disney, who I have grown up with and cherish have made something this terrible and actually think it's good. Treasure planet was heaven after this!The moral this one left me with was ""Hey, it's okay to treat others like ... because Ohana means family."" - Sorry, I won't buy that. I'd strongly suggest parents read some proffessional reviews on this movie, there's a reason this movie hasn't made much money in comparison to the Disneys of the past. ""Hunchback"" and even ""Pocahantas"" grossed over $100 million more than this one, and at least they were boring but inoffensive. I hope that says something. In conclusion, avoid this festering turd of a film, and if you have it and like it, watc it again having read this and see if you can deny what I've said.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the funniest cartoon features in years,"Disney's animation division roars back with one of the funniest and most imaginative cartoon features in years.Starting in outer space, with a mad scientist on trial for creating a genetic monster (Stitch, a cross between a mutant koala and one of the Gremlins; but with a real mean attitude), the action shifts quickly to a Hawaiian island.There, the standard Disney family of two orphan sisters (what IS it with Disney's idea of the modern family?!) Nani and the much younger Lilo, are struggling; Nani to hold down a job and keep the feisty Lilo from the social services, Lilo against the world.When Stitch escapes from the space ship taking him into exile, he lands on the island, pursued by aliens intent on his recapture, only to be bought by Lilo, convinced he's a puppy!What follows is some of the most inspired madness in years. Whatever the animators were on when they thought this one up, could I have some, please?! It's all in there; Elvis, nods and winks to classic films and series (check out the Godzilla` scene and the Jaws` tribute), perfect casting, bright colours, excellent sight and voice gags, glorious soundtrack, tightly told with none of the lags and pauses many films suffer from and, for once, the typical Disney message` (everyone needs a family) does not leave you desperately searching for the puke bag!You know that line? The one about a film for children of all ages? This is it! Wanna know how good it is? I saw it in English with German subtitles. It was STILL funny!I'm lucky, in that my work means I get to see a great many films. And what's been missing for so long has been a real story, well told. I'm tired of product placements and overpaid stars pretending to be real people with real problems, of by-the-numbers emoting and the cynical, smooth, manipulations of overpriced studio productions with their reliance on computer effects, lacking all originality.Very rarely, you get to see a film which restores your faith in what cinema can be; a great experience shared jointly with strangers.Lilo & Stitch` is that experience. For the first time in ages, I saw a film I truly enjoyed. It sets out to do nothing more than amuse and entertain and does so beyond all expectation.You want a good time at the movies? This is it.

Meega na la queesta!,"What do you say first about ""Lilo and Stitch""? Do you stand slackjawed to learn the film cost $80 million to make when it looks considerably cheaper? Do you revel in its totally irreverent moments and clever touches? Or do you talk about the overall feel of the film?Frankly, L+S is just so-so. It has some of the funniest moments in a Disney film (""My friends needs to be punished."") and some of the most disjointed. It does not feel as consistently whacky as ""The Emperor's New Groove"" or as saccharine as ANYTHING from Disney in the last two years. Some of the characters are priceless, though, and I like Stitch a great deal. To me, though, that's not nearly enough to make it a classic. Let's face it: the studio paid $80 million for THIS? On what?Compare the storytelling and animation of this movie to ""Spirit"" that came out within a week of L+S's debut and got clobbered at the box office, and you might understand why I cannot give this movie super-high marks.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stitch rocks,"The biggest reason, to go and see this film is Stitch. What an amazing little creature. OK, I know he is supposed to be a scary monster, but who can resist that cute little head and that funny voice? This character does not have to say anything and can make you laugh harder than some comedians who think about a funny line or comment for about half an hour. The rest of the film is more or less standard' animated feature with a dramatic' sub-plot and a little love' theme'. The only thing that is not standard (except the cuteness of Stitch) is the great music by and inspired by the work of Elvis. I really liked that. First of all, because the music fitted well into the film and second of all because it is good music (even Stitch can't stay as evil' as he is supposed to be with that sort of music around!)7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Suprisingly moving.,"It's hard to say what this movie is: A crazy sci-fi story, or a serious family drama, or both? The trailers showed it as one, big, crazed sci-fi epic, but I was amazed at how much this movie touched me. Opening at an intergalactic tribunal overJumba Jookiba, an alien scientist jailed for creating a living weapon of mass destruction, and developing into a high-speed star-trek type chase as theexperiment escapes to Earth, the movie segues into the introduction of a little Hawaiian girl named Lilo, who is clearly not a typical five or six year old. She makes sacrifices to a fish she believes controls the weather, reads books about voodoo, posts pictures of obese tourists on her walls, and adores Elvis, and her older sister is clearly struggling to raise a child like her since the death of their parents. The relationship between the two sisters is handled remarkably well, and is a welcome change in a Disney movie. Having the writers drop ""Stitch,""the destructively deranged alien experiment into this family seems like too big of a risk. But the story's appeal does not come from the comedy of this familydealing with Stitch's antics, but from the effect the family has on Stitch. He is very much like the Frankenstein monster, knowing he is unnaturally created, andfeeling he lacks what the rest of the world has, and doubtful, knowing he is built to destroy, that he can fit in. His lonely night scene, in which he cries into the night ""I'm lost,"" is just as moving as any scene from Dumbo, Bambi, or MaryPoppins. Chris Sanders, writer and director for the movie, makes Stitch aremarkably sympathetic character, aside from the physical and verbal comedy,in which his voice is the joke as much as Donald Duck's. David Odgen Stiers,under Eastern European accent, does the honors for Jumba, while KevinMacDonald, imitating Jerry Lewis' vocal styles, is a hilarious Pleakley, the erratic expert on Earth. Also excellent is Ving Rhames as the Man-in-Black turnedSocial Worker, ""Cobra"" Bubbles, going back to his ""Pulp Fiction"" stylings. The real credit, however, goes to Daveigh Chase for her in depth, eccentricallyinnocent portrayal of Lilo. Finally, the film's Hawaiian setting is well done, helping to break away from the stereotypes that have existed for years. Therendition of ""Aloha Oe,"" which has become a hoaky Hawaiian stereotype foryears, reminds us that it is a song of goodbye. The watercolor backgrounds give the movie a delightful old-fashioned feel, contrasting almost comically with the new-age themes. Do the two stories mix well? Does the movie move too quicklyfrom scene to scene? Who cares! Don't think about that while you watch, andthis movie will capture your heart! Movies that do that don't have to make sense all the time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Entertaining and with a message.,"Yet again a Disney movie with a different style. Of all their efforts from the last couple of years, this is one of the better ones.Of all the Disney movies this is probably the most ""adult"". The characters are more ""adult"" and so is the story line. The story itself is actually pretty serious. Well, I'm talking about the Lilo and Nani story line of course not the one with Stich. It's pretty heavy stuff and it goes about some serious issues and shows the value of family. I like the way the story is brought.But luckily it's not all serious, there is still lot's of fun and things to laugh about. There are some typical Disney characters that provide some comical situations. I especially like the Cobra Bubbles character voiced by Ving Rhames.There is a good balance between the serious and funny scene's. The seriousness never ruins the fun and the funny scene's never ruin the serious situations. Perfect match!The style is cool and the pace is fast and the Hawaiian locations are beautiful.However the story line is a bit too simple and some of the situations and scene's are a bit too crazy and forced.Nevertheless, still very entertaining and it has a good and important message in it.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"good family film- a little odd,though","LILO & STITCH is a pretty good family film, but it's definitely different from your traditional Disney animated films. If that's what Disney was going for, then I feel they succeeded 100%. The biggest element of the film that grabbed me wasn't the STITCH character, but LILO and her sister. I found their story to touching and endearing. The aliens looking for STITCH story line was a bit of a beating for me. Overall=7 out of 10.

This is certainly not kid-fare,"I don't have the words to describe how much I hated this movie.  As I sat there with my three small children, I cringed at what they were witnessing. Lilo was a brat who attacked and bit another little girl in her first scene. She and her sister screamed at each other in a fit of rage, then upon making up concluded, ""That's how sisters act"" or something like that. There was the threat of the small family being ripped apart during the entire movie.  Stitch was not cute in the least.  The scene of him being run over by an 18-wheeler was surely terrifying for small children.  The only comic relief came from the 2 aliens sent to retrieve Stitch.  And although they were quite funny, they certainly couldn't redeem the entire movie. Finally at the end, Stitch redeems himself and it appears that the family will stay together, but it was too little too late.  And there was way to much violence, yelling, bad behavior, etc. for small children to be witnessing. My children will never see this movie again.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

...worthy of the Disney name,"Lilo and Stitch was worthy of the Disney name that spawned the most glorious age of hand drawn animation. I must concede that I am a Disney Freak. I am a big fan of the movies, theme parks, collectible items, and other such things. Still, I like to think of myself as an objective reviewer because I do not like everything that Disney throws at the big screen, especially more recently. Lilo and Stitch did have a tendency to get over emotional and corny at times by trying to pound in the theme that ""Ohana means family. Family means no one gets left behind."" This statement was repeated over and over by our protagonists throughout the movie. Is it important? Sure. The lesson for youngings is to never to give up on someone because they are different and that family is very important. Aside from the traditional themes, this movie was a fun kids movie whose tone was just right for its target audience.Go to http://thethreeacts.wordpress.com/2012/06/21/lilo-and-stitch/ to read the complete review!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

7 of 10 stars. Another Disney non-musical.,"When one thinks animated feature' (at least in the North American sense), one conjures up a musical rendition of an adapted fairy tale or legendary story.  Disney has been largely successful with that format in the past, and they seem to be diverging from it.  They brought us the hilarious antics in `The Emperor's New Groove' which was furthest from that format.  Now they bring us another break from the pack, `Lilo & Stitch'.Experiment 6-2-6' was designed by an alien race to be a super-soldier of sorts.  An artificial life deemed to be unsafe it is condemned to imprisonment.  However, it's clever enough to elude its captors, escapes, and crash-lands on Earth.  The landing target is, of all places, Hawaii where it is adopted by a young girl named Lilo (pronounced LEE-lo').  She is unaware of the creature's origins, mistakes it for a strange dog, and names him `Stitch'.  The story follows Lilo and Stitch (hence the title) as Lilo struggles with her broken family life (being raised by only her older sister), and Stitch adapts to life on Earth, while attempting to avoid capture by the society from which he escaped.I found this film to be as entertaining to me, as the children in the theatre found it. The relationships in this movie are those that children can relate with.  Stitch's adapting to life in Hawaii is one that comes off quite comical, and routinely unexpected.  His social skills are lacking, and he reacts quickly, without thought, which is the source for the comedy.  I found myself laughing out loud at several of Stitch's antics, and his overall character behaviour really doesn't grow tiring.The movie does take an emotional side too as Lilo confronts her broken home and grows attached to Stitch, who ultimately is threatened with his own capture.  Although it could have gotten completely sappy at the end, it doesn't, which is refreshing.  Of course, it is a Disney feature, so a happy ending is always expected, but it's a light one complementing the light-hearted romp of this movie.Granted, it's not Disney's platinum achievements, nor is it an AMAZING story but given the low-key promotion this movie has had, it might slip by you un-detected.  My recommendation is that you do not let this happen. It's completely suitable to go to with children, or as a date flick, or even with a buddy.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"In a word, cute","Lilo and Stitch is basically nothing special from my view; the alien Stitch is a cool character and having a setting in Hawaii is sharp, but this could also be the type of cartoon that if it didn't have the clout to be from Disney would be on during the day on Cartoon Network or other. Incidentally towards the end things in the movie get really inevitable, and almost sets it up for a follow-up to come on a TV series.  And yet, I liked the movie, and for the most part it kept me (a late teen just right out of seeing Minority Report) entertained which means it will be pitch perfect for kids and might envelop their parents with its humor (Elvis, MIB part 1, Godzilla and part of Jaws are referenced).

Friends don't let friends see Lilo and Stitch...,"I have no idea what movie most of these reviewers saw, but it wasn't this one.  Before last night, the worst movie that I had ever paid money to see was the ""Joey Tribiane""-led Lost in Space.Lilo and Stitch is worse.This would have been a great 20-minute cartoon.  Stitch is an interesting enough character, and the family that he joins is very real, with real personalities and real problems.  Lilo acts like a real child, and her quirks are endearing.  Then the whole thing goes to H-E-double-hockey-sticks.First of all, Disney's marketing force goes into full drive with the introduction of a couple of aliens who try to recapture Stitch.  They exist solely to sell toys.  They add absolutely nothing to the plot, and get very tired very quickly.I can hear it now--""But it's an *adult* humor movie!""  First of all, part of this is correct, in that your children will probably not get much of this film.  The ""blue period"" that dominates the middle section of the movie is too heavy for young kids, and no, mouthing the catchphrases does not mean that your precocious little one gets it.The worst thing, however, is its inability to decide how serious it wants to be.  The plot flies from serious, melodramatic ""After-School Special"" drama to slapstick so base that the Three Stooges wouldn't touch it in the course of about five seconds.  Plot holes were closed by what seemed to be the first suggestion (no matter how ludicrous) that flew out of someone's piehole in a boardroom.I don't look for Hamlet when I go to a Disney movie.  I do expect, however, that the quality of the plot and story will surpass a undergraduate screenwriting class.  Lilo and Stitch doesn't even come close.

Lots of fun but still forgettable,"I keep wondering: Where is Disney going? There was a time when each movie they made was as good or better than the one before, namely ""The little mermaid"", ""The Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"". That era is certainly over. They even used these for ""Lilo & Stitch"" advertising campaign.""Lilo & Stitch"" is 85 minutes of fun, kids and adults will like it just as any other of the last Disney movies, and as such is nowhere near becoming a memorable film like the other movies I mentioned. That's what I think Disney is missing. The best animation movies since ""The Lion King"" that came out under the Disney label were all Pixar's productions: the ""Toy Story"" movies, ""A bug's life"" and ""Monsters Inc."".Maybe the original idea was to make a movie about a character that was completely different than any other they've made before. I think that idea got lost in the way. From the trailers and advertising we got the impression that Stitch was going to be next to Bart Simpson as the most mischievous cartoon character of all, but it turned out to be a lot more subtle. What kept them?I'm beginning to think that Disney will not be on the vanguard of animation again for a long time and instead will be following Dreamworks' steps. Too bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

9/10,"Hilarious, Gorgeous, Sparkling (and with a creamy-crispy cookie core)!! Lilo and Stitch is certainly one of the most entertaining and especially one of the most funny Disney films ever. I really loved the latest Disney films like Monster Inc. and Emperor's new Groove, too, but L&S took the ideas from Emperor and developed them. The humor is just so un-Disney-esque, it's almost Simpson-esque. By the way, my Disney favorites are The little mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.One of my favorite jokes was the scene in which Lilo asks Mr. Bubbles (Mr. Bobo) if he has ever killed someone or the scene in which Nani tries to give Lilo instructions what to say to Mr. Bubbles about her family life and Lilo finally ends up saying that she gets beaten up every day by her sister.And I loved the jokes with Dr. Jamba as tourist and Pleakley as his wife...by the way, Pleakley seems to be a bit gay at all (Remember that charming phone call with his mother, when Pleakley sits on the palm tree?) And it is one of the rare, if not the only Disney cartoon that hints something like sex (Lilo to David: ""Nani said she liked your bottom."" or something similar). I know that Disney establishes a new character design in every film, but why does everybody in this film have these fat legs?!I don't know why some mothers (it can only be mothers, perhaps belonging to the group I personally call AMA (Adjusted Mothers of America)) screw up about L&S, like Disney was only allowed to make films that provide important morally values. For those AMA-Moms: IT IS NOT!

impossibly cute and moving,"While the overriding message of ""Lilo and Stitch"" has been mined before in films such as ""Babe"" and ""Shrek"" (that appearances are deceiving and we should learn to tolerate the differences in others) and the film leans toward the stereotypes of Hawaiian culture, it succeeds greatly in the relationship between Lilo, a friendless young girl, and Stitch, a malevolent creature from another galaxy who crash-lands on Earth. The humor doesn't always connect, but the story is an offbeat fusing of fantasy and reality that becomes a showcase for the crazed Stitch and outsider Lilo, which is the moving core of the film. And, amazingly, the conclusion of this animated feature musters up some authentic tears.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney is back on track!,"Films by the Walt Disney Company have been in danger of becoming stale recently - and although there have been valiant attempts to stray from the well-worn fairy tale musical (such as the recent Atlantis: The Lost Empire, a Jules Verne homage of nineteenth century explorers attempting to find the fable underwater city, strangely enough for a Disney film, without song), it has only been the CGI offerings of Pixar that has revitalized Disney with such modern classics as Toy Story and Monsters Inc. But how was Disney to reenergize itself with its traditional cel animation? The answer lay in the story of a small Hawaiian girl called Lilo, and her pet ""dog"" Stitch. Lilo is not a traditional Disney heroine. Unlike Belle from Beauty and the Beast and Ariel from The Little Mermaid, Lilo is not the perfect girl who puts everybody before herself. She is a deeply troubled girl who cannot come to terms with the death of her parents in a car accident. She deliberately ostracizes herself from her peers, and even goes out of her way to antagonize them. She also frequently clashes with her sister Nonnie, who is trying to hold the remnants of their family together even though she is no more than a child herself. Nonnie is also not perfect. Lilo annoys her, and even though there is a desperate love between them it is their differences and inability to grieve properly that brings them to the attention of the child welfare authorities. Nonnie is given a short period of time in which to prove herself fit to be Lilo's guardian, and to try and cheer her little sister up she decides to adopt a family dog. Enter Stitch - the product of an alien genetic experiment who has escaped from his homeworld, and is followed by an intergalactic united nations to attempt to bring him back. Stitch will prove to be a kindred spirit to Lilo, as he is also on a path of self-destruction. He has been programmed to destroy everything that gets in his way, but under Lilo's guidance and away from the influence of his creators he becomes open to the Hawaiian concept of ""okana"": family. Nonnie and Lilo operate by the maxim that in a family nobody gets left behind. And that grows to include Stitch as his secret is revealed, but he proves his worth in a family that is trying to piece itself together. The film does lag slightly towards the end though, as there is the sewing up of a vast and imaginative plot when the other aliens reveal themselves. But is a slight hiccup in what I feel to be one of the best films of 2002. In the end the characters realize that a family can be composed of many elements, and that members do not have to be of the same bloodline. You can choose your friends, and in that respect they can become your family as well. This is an extremely heartfelt film, but it is not as saccharine as past Disney offerings. There are some true moments of madness to be discovered, and also great poignancy as we watch Nonnie and Lilo trying to rebuild their lives after a tragedy. This is helped by the beauty of the animation itself - Disney has reverted to the traditional watercolouring method that was apparently only last used in the forties. It is a method well suited to bring out the vibrancy of the Hawaiian setting, and the movie rocks along with an Elvis Presley soundtrack which works surprisingly well. All of this adds up to part of the Disney canon which proves that the old Mouse Factory's non-CGI animation department isn't dead yet. There is a breath of fresh air rolling through, and it has been provided by Lilo and Stitch.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney delves deeper.,"Lilo and Stitch is another of Disney's attempts in a genre that appeals to all ages, having both action and family moments.  Lilo and Stitch is no less.  It starts off with a nice little battle scene involving the red police cruiser.I missed the first few minutes of Lilo and Stitch, but still caught on to everything that was going on.  That's always a plus--when a movie is not so complicated as to shatter your understanding in the middle of it.  However, the storyline is rather shallow, and soon I was begging for some complications.It was also a very slow movie.  I was told it was pretty much nonstop action, but was very disappointed when this was not true.  Disney's action genre debut with Dinosaur and Atlantis:  The Lost Empire were more action-packed than this movie.  Lilo and Stitch is mostly about a crumbling family as it tries to build itself back up without parents.The action scenes, however few, are satisfying.  Stitch's growth in character is real; he starts out as a maniacal, trash-everything in sight little beast, but grows feelings toward Lilo and perhaps a new home.  One can really relate to this little monster.The music is not all that great.  It has its moments, but I forgot most of it and the composer, which probably means it's not really memorable.But the movie was just slow.  Not childish, not corny, just slow.  I liked the great animation and the characters, but I don't think that this movie should ever have had a chance against Spirit:  Stallion of the Cimarron, which was released earlier.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Typical Disney, but if it aint broke don't fix it..","This has to be one of the more simple straight forward animation movies I have seen in recent years.  Gone is CGI, 3D backgrounds or the latest tricks.  In an odd way, it seems refreshing.  Put that to boot with a charming story, well voiced characters, and a lead that you can't help but enjoy and you have a winner.Lilo & Stitch is about a space alien that was an experiment gone wrong, that ends up escaping and crashing to planet earth (Hawaii specifically).  A ragtag of 2 aliens are out to capture the creature (dubbed experiment 622), but run into a road block when a lonley misfit girl named Lilo adopts the creature when it pretends to masquerade as a dog in an animal shelter.  She names the creature Stitch and tries to teach the 'thing' about the love of family, which is difficult since Stitch is programmed to be nothing but a destructive wreck.Stitch is absolutely HYSTERICAL..  Take a blue Koala figure with 4 arms that crawls like a bug, and has a temperment like the Tasmanian Devil and speaks like Donald Duck on hyperdrive..  Stitch is a laugh a minute, (the first scene when Lilo brings Stitch home, and he jams his hind legs into his mouth and rolls into a ball, had my dying on the floor..)The story continues and concludes with standard Disney fare, (the good guys win, everyone goes home happy), but there is certainly more than enough entertainment for adults in this film as well as for kids.I wish I had Stitch when I was a kid...Rating 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Rude, obnoxious, but still Disney","Once while talking to a well regarded children's book illustrator (whose name I can't remember) I was told, children, especially boys like pictures that are ugly. Cute when out a long time ago.Now Disney is the home of cute. So you can imagine the sales pitch of Lilo & Stitch to the suits at Disney.""Well the main character Lilo is a thoroughly obnoxious and disturbingly weird child, who is looked after by her sister who has her own problems. Which of course makes them the perfect host family for a banned genetic experiment (626) who is programmed to crush, kill destroy and is on the run from the alien council."" Imagine the slow steady puffing of fat cigars and blank stares.""Did I mention that Ohana means family....yeah it is all about family..."" I think the result was Disneyfied (I want that to become a word in the dictionary one day, meaning to made family orientated and cute) because 626 (aka stitch) is too cute for the scripted response of horror when people meet Stitch.Certainly this movie breaks the core Disney formula while also keeping to it and in many ways it has been a pity that Disney has not keep up this approach leaving other studios to make things like Shrek (an obnoxious ogre whose bad habits are popular amongst modern children).Lilo & Stitch is a lot of fun to watch, but maybe a little too simple for adults to really get into it. It has the usual bad blend of 3D and 2D animation that Disney took a long time to overcome (Mulan was probably the first time they got it right.) I do wonder if anyone involved in this movie actually went to Hawaii?",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good fun.,"Lilo and Stitch is definitely not a 'usual' Disney movie, but then again, neither was the fun 'Emperor's New Groove'. This movie is not aimed at little children either, as the humour at times is rather adult and younger kids won't understand what's going on.The animation isn't so great and looks rather early Nineties except for some of the computer animated graphics of the space craft. The story is rather bizarre, and I won't ruin any of it, but it's enjoyable in the typical Disney way. Lilo (pronounced Lee-low) is adorable and her and Stitch go very well together on screen. The movie does taper off towards the end with a mish-mash of scenes, but the movie as a whole is fun, and worth the time to watch it. However, it won't go down in history as a memorable Disney movie. By the number of positive reviews though, it appears I could be wrong, but there really wasn't anything here that was truly genius. I won't go as far as saying it's a straight to video/DVD release, but it wasn't anything new.It was a laugh though and definitely worth a trip to see. One of those 'happy' movies you can't be sad whilst watching.",,Anonymous,Animation
Another Broken Family Movie but With Entertaining Sidekicks.,"Like most Disney movies, the main character tends to be a problematic adolescent or teen that would absolutely be ridiculed in real life by the same people who are fans of these characters on screen. I know we were supposed to dislike the local girls who are mean to Lilo, but it doesn't take much discerning to see that Lilo is abusive and toxic. Of course, as Stitch's mean nature goes through a transformation, Lilo has the opportunity to grow. She does not however, but Stitch and Nani do. Still, this is a fun ride with great soundtrack. I fear for the upcoming Live Action remake, especially with the excessive amount of racism coming from those who think the Native actors are too light skin. Eek.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lilo & Stitch is a Disney classic that deserves a spot in the upper echelon of their library.,"My daughter and I recently watched Lilo & Stitch (2002) on Disney+. The story follows two sisters in Hawaii trying to rebuild their lives after the loss of their parents. The older sister, Nani, struggles to provide for her younger sister, Lilo, who is having a hard time fitting in and making friends. With child services keeping a close eye on them, the last thing they need is an indestructible, genetically engineered alien killing machine landing in their lives-but that's exactly what they get.This film is co-directed by Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders, who later collaborated on How to Train Your Dragon. It features the voices of Daveigh Chase (The Ring), Tia Carrere (Wayne's World), Ving Rhames (Pulp Fiction), and Kevin Michael Richardson (Mortal Kombat).The characters and family dynamic are so well developed that they draw you in from the very first scene. The animation is a beautifully modernized take on classic 2D Disney, full of life and color. The voice acting is perfectly cast, with each actor bringing their character to life in a way that's both fitting and engaging. The aliens are wonderfully unique, and while Stitch is wild and chaotic, it's impossible not to be captivated by him in every scene.Beneath the lighthearted moments lies a deep, emotional core. The weight of the sisters' struggles is heartbreakingly authentic and delivered with brilliance. The tone of the story evolves beautifully, and the characters are so endearing that you can't help but root for them at every turn.In conclusion, Lilo & Stitch is a Disney classic that deserves a spot in the upper echelon of their library. I'd score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
This one is almost strictly for the kids,"This is a nice, pleasant movie and a heck of a lot better than many recent Disney cartoons (such as POCAHONTAS, HUNCHBACK and HERCULES). Most of the reason it's pretty likable is the film's sense of humor and light touch. However, at the same time, this film is targeting kids and perhaps teens and seems to make no attempt to hook adults. While some adults surely liked the film, it's hard to imagine many of them who preferred this to the many other wonderful Disney full-length cartoons. LILO AND STICH is just too inconsequential and light to ever compare to LITTLE MERMAID, BAMBI, PINOCCHIO and especially BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Now this is not meant as serious criticism--just explaining who the intended audience is and who will most likely like the film. My kids (one of which was a teen) loved it and I felt like I was just there for the ride. Inoffensive to adults and full of silly hi-jinx that the kids will no doubt love.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Just like wine, it gracefully ages well!","Ok, I'm not a kid, I don't have kids, and heaven willing, I'll never have any. That being said, this movie remains on hot standby when I can't find anything good on television. It's a well made story, excellent plot, & I love the DVD extras when Stitch was ""interrupting"" other Disney movies, especially the flying carpet scene in Aladdin.If you had kids during the film's initial release, you may want to have them try watching it again. Through different eyes. I guarantee they'll see something else they hadn't seen prior. Or rather, they had seen differently as a child.Overall, it's a very lovely story. Worthy of Disney animation films.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Difinatly a step up for Disney,"This animated feature is a major step up from the studio's recent (and weak) films. Much better that Atlantis, Treasure Planet, and Emperor's New Groove. Though the story isn't as epic as the lion king or Little Mermaid, it is very entertaining and ever so adorable and very sweet. You can't argue with that! The animation, unlike some recent movies, is really in the classic style. It is absolutely beautiful; with watercolor backgrounds and hand animated water (instead of CGI). The character animation is very, very good; smooth and fluid (as smooth as any computer animation). The story is all about family and belonging, a little sappy sometimes, but good for kids and adults that don't mind feeling a little sentimental. Could be a little boring for some younger kids (not a whole lot of flashiness) but Stitch is a great and entertaining character.This is one of the last hand animated movies we'll probably ever see. So sad; this movie's look is so ""warm"" and ""vibrant"" compared to the ""cold"" and ""plasticy"" look of the recent barrage of CGI animations.Recommend highly.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Better than I remember!!,"I can remember watching this movie when I was young and not being a big fan of it for some reason. Now watching it as an adult in my 30s I realize it is a really good enjoyable movie that did make me tear up a little bit. A lot of people probably already know there is a scene towards the beginning of the movie where Lilo hides in a dryer, which I understand it's not a good message because it's not safe for little kids to hide in a dryer. For the Disney+ Version of this movie and for the recent Blu-ray release, they replaced the dryer door with a pizza box to try to cover it up but I don't think it works well although it's such a very short scene.

Lilo & Stitch,"""Lilo"" is a young and caring lass who dreams of owning a dog. ""626"" is the malevolent product of some illegal alien engineering at the hands of megalomanic scientist ""Jookiba"". He's sentenced to never see the light of day again and his creation to be abandoned on a lifeless moon. Luckily for ""626"", though, the captain of his transport ship ""Gantu"" isn't the most competent so he escapes and finds himself on Hawaii. Bemused and befuddled by his new surroundings, and rather hemmed in because he cannot swim, he ends up being mistaken for a stray dog and impounded. That's where he meets ""Lilo"" who has been promised a mutt of her own. What now ensues is a tale of bonding. ""Lilo"" is facing some domestic turbulence at the hands of social worker ""Bubbles"" but ""Stitch"" is still determined to make their lives interesting and, if necessary, use the people to protect him from the pursuing agents of the ""Galactic Federation"". The underlying moralising is all the same as usual - teamwork, loneliness, love and the values of family and sharing, but Dean DeBlois manages to dress that all up cleverly with plenty of enjoyable escapades, some frequently pithy one-liners and even the slightest hint of menace from the Grand Councilwoman who must have been inspired by Glenn Close! I didn't love the style of animation, too much eyes - but the colours and general look of the film are vibrant and the characters are engaging til the end.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worst thing out of Disney Animation studios since...,"... well, hard to say.  It might very well be the bottom of the barrel.... rock bottom.  Worst animated flick from Disney EVER. Trainwreck of a film.  Sitch is horrible - not funny, not cute, not amusing, not appalling.  Just bad and boring.  Family Setup (orphaned kids, teenage older sister about to lose younger little sister)... lame.  How could an animator blow the chance to draw Hawaii?  They did here.  Same with the outer space sequences.  How they spent $80,000,000 is incomprehensible. Pitiful.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Nope, it's not simplicity at its best...","A sweet film that captures the feeling that anyone has the ability to change for the better through love, sharing, and bonding!  It focuses on themes that are easily associated with everyday life.  Sure, I'm fascinated with the way this film connects the themes to the Hawaiian 'ohana' concept.Ohana, for any Hawaiian, means a group of people (closely and distantly related) who share nearly everything. Yep, sharing is the core of ohana value. Hawaiians believe that duties to 'ohana' will help them increase their mana (spirituality). The concept of `immediate family' is alien to native Hawaiians. I'm not sure whether the very young viewers will be able to grasp this association, but I'm convinced they would definitely grasp and enjoy watching the development of friendship between the environmental-conscious, little Lilo and the koala-gremlin like, extra-terrestrial Stitch.Two characters who are so different in appearance, yet almost similar in behavior and traits. I've no doubt that it would tickle the young viewers to catch the mischievous behaviors of these characters on screen. Also, there's enough action and plenty of wacky and weird looking characters in this film to hold up their interest and attention. Young lads would most certainly applaud the sci-fi creativity. And there's nothing crude or terrifying to tempt contempt from their parents. This film has a fair amount of humor, but I'm not convinced that kids below the age of 5 would be able to recognize most of it. Overall, the movie is paced well and the length of the story is appropriate - even for the very young kiddies.The artistic style of this movie pumps up memories of the traditional animated cartoon medium of Freddie Moore, Ollie Johnston, Frank Thomas and Eric Larson. But I wouldn't say it's simplicity at its best.  The characters lack the charisma and color of those characters of Monsters, Inc. And the film does fall short of those lovely musical elements that have come to be so appealing with the modern-day Disney animated flicks. After all, the film's setting is Hawaii, and Hawaii is known to be an island of song, beauty and dance!  However, I'm grateful for the familiar Queen Liliuokalani's composition `Aloha O'e.'The voices of Tia Carrera and Jason Scott Lee succeed in giving their characters the Hawaiian credibility. But overall, the voices given to the majority of characters don't appear to energize the characters' personalities.  Only Stitch's character is cool and pretty credible. an alien whose actions definitely speak louder than words. He is the character that truly brings out laughter from the children sitting around me!Obviously, this film pays a great deal of homage to Elvis. Quite appropriate, I must say!  How can fans of Elvis ever forget that The King had serenaded them with those unforgettable songs from his `Blue Hawaii' flick!  Overall, it's a nice summer film to watch with the younger kids. But I doubt it's the sort of Disney movie the kids would be willing to watch over and over again.",,Anonymous,Animation

"something old, something new","This new Disney -picture L&S I really enjoyed. It was far better than last years' disappointing 'Atlantis' (I can only hope that 'Treasure Planet' turns out better as an action-adventure sci fi movie from Disney). Hilariously funny, serious and heart -warming and totally weird at the same time. There's something new  and fresh to this movie I cannot pin down exactly: the fact that Stich is not a cute animal? Or that the heroine Lilo is not a princess (to be)  and she can be  a real brat, though you cannot help feeling for her? That the story is about 'ordinary people' with problems most people can associate with? The 'old' part is of course the use of water-colour backgrounds. I understand some critics complained about  the ''Saturday-tv-cartoon' level of animation, but I think the 'simplicity' works nice here. It doesn't always have to be slick, detailed 'breathtaking'  'Lion King' -like.  L&S doesn't require the same technique as, for instance 'Tarzan' to be enjoyed. L&S is worth at least a look or two, if not more. I give it 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The different one,"Lilo and Stitch is one of those few different Disney films, which is greatly appreciated because the style takes a great distance from the typical princess stories. On the contrary, we see that the protagonist couple are a gale of chaos and rebellious fun, although with a lot of charisma. The photography and color palette, specifically the backgrounds, are well done, but for Hawaii it's a fairly dark film. The sun's rays and summer days could have been used much more. The edition is almost ideally round. The directable decisions are also good.My big stone in the shoe for this film is that the story plays a lot with emotional blackmail and it's noticeable from the beginning. Apart from that great detail the film becomes entertaining, the 90 minutes fly by and most of the comic situations are enjoyed.Absolutely recommended for family viewing on a warm Saturday morning.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A heartwarming tale of unlikely friendships,"""Lilo & Stitch"" is a delightful Disney film that combines sci-fi excitement with heartfelt storytelling. The movie follows Lilo, a spirited Hawaiian girl struggling with her sister Nani to maintain a semblance of family life after the loss of their parents. Enter Stitch, an alien experiment gone awry, who crashes onto Earth and becomes an unexpected addition to their family.The film excels in showcasing the importance of family and belonging. Lilo's quirky yet endearing personality pairs perfectly with Stitch's chaotic energy, creating a dynamic and touching bond that drives the narrative. The Hawaiian setting adds a unique and vibrant backdrop, enhancing the film's charm with its beautiful animation and cultural references.Supporting characters like Nani, her love interest David, and the overzealous social worker Cobra Bubbles add depth and humor to the story. The soundtrack, featuring Elvis Presley hits and original Hawaiian-inspired songs, further enriches the film's emotional and cultural layers.""Lilo & Stitch"" is a charming blend of humor, adventure, and heartfelt moments.

"Not one of Disney's great films, but a decent little adventure","This animated Disney flick was released when I was a teenager, several years after I had lost interest in Disney cartoons. I doubt I ever even heard of ""Lilo & Stitch"" until several years after its theatrical run. I first saw it in late 2006, after reviving my interest in Disney. Even though it's not one of the company's most popular films, I remember loving it at the time! Nearly three years later, I've seen it a second time. I didn't like it nearly as much as I did the first time, nor was I expecting to. Before my second viewing, I was hoping I would be able to give it an 8/10 (didn't think it would be any higher than that this time), which I can't, as it turns out, but at least I can still give it a 7, so I guess it came close to meeting my expectations.Far from Earth, an evil alien scientist named Dr. Jumba Jookiba is put on trial for illegal genetic experimentation. He has created Experiment 626, a small but aggressive, dangerous, and nearly indestructible creature! The scientist is sentenced to prison, and his creature is to be exiled on an asteroid. However, Experiment 626 manages to escape to Earth, landing in Hawaii! Jumba, along with Agent Pleakley, are sent to capture him. A troubled little girl named Lilo, who has been looked after by her older sister, Nani, since the death of their parents, and doesn't seem to have any friends, lives on the island where the creature has landed. Nani hasn't been doing a very good job looking after her younger sister, and unless she improves soon, social worker Cobra Bubbles will take Lilo to a foster home! The two sisters go to adopt a dog at the animal shelter, where Experiment 626 has ended up. He poses as a dog, and Lilo adopts him and calls him Stitch. As Jumba and Agent Pleakley try to capture him, Stitch causes even more trouble for the sisters, and will make it even harder for them to stay under the same roof!Early in the story, Lilo can certainly be a pain, doing things like attacking and biting one of her peers! I think the writers went a little too far with her aggressive tendencies! It doesn't help that Nani is also a little over-the-top at times. The conflict between the two sisters could have been done better. Fortunately, despite those problems bringing the movie down, there are still merits. The animation is excellent, with some gorgeous tropical backgrounds, the film may get more entertaining as it goes along, and there are moments of poignancy, often involving Stitch, a very cute character. The second time I watched the film, I was a little disappointed by the humour, but still found some noteworthy gags. I would say the most noteworthy ones (or at least most of them) involve Jumba and Agent Pleakley on Earth, trying the catch Stitch, especially with Pleakley disguised as a woman! Last but not least, ""Lilo & Stitch"" has a good message about the importance of family. All these things make this 2002 Disney effort watchable. Maybe it's more enjoyable for kids, but it does have enough for adults.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Average at Best,"""Lilo and Stitch"" falls in a strange place in Disney's history. It's post-renaissance, but the character of Stitch has a cult following.

The space elements are incredibly boring and some of the characters aren't fully fleshed out.

Weak.,"Usually I'm not against Disney making films that stray from their usual formulas (heck, I liked ""The Black Cauldron"") but ""Lilo and Stitch"", being one of those films, just didn't work for me.It's refreshing to see a Disney film that takes place in present day, allowing us to be treated to some great Elvis music - the bits of songs heard throughout the film being one of its only highlights for me.Otherwise it's a rather bland effort. Stitch is a serious contender for the title ""the most annoying Disney character ever"". As for the visuals, I understand they used watercolors to achieve a vintage look a-la-Dumbo, but anyone who appreciates great visuals in a Disney film would find this film a letdown in that department. It's flat, soft and uninspired.I'm aware this film made good money at the box-office so I guess it does appeal to some folks... minors, I guess?

Lilo & Stitch review,"Hawaii mischief. So this is about a Hawaiian girl named Lilo (Daveigh Chase). She adopts the ugliest dog at the shelter, but it turns out that he's actually not a dog at all but a dangerous alien fugitive from a distant planet. When other aliens try to take care of the problem, it is only going to complicate matters on Earth. Now, this is one that I simply missed. I was not watching movies as obsessively at age 17 as I am now, so I will have a few blind spots that will cause Joe Schmo to say ""OMG you haven't seen _______."" . Now I can say that I see why people hold this movie in such high regard.What's not to like?Lilo & Stitch was made for that rebellious young child that walks to the beat of her own drum. Stitch is chaos incarnate, but he always manages to be lovable at the same time. Lilo and Stitch are always bouncing off one another and are the perfect pair of misfits, so of course this is going to speak to outspoken children everywhere. Because I wasn't familiar, I thought that this might be a case where this walked so Moana could run, but that's really not so; they both individually manage to do their own thing, so props to Disney for not photocopying their own products. The jokes in this hit far more often than not which helps to keep this moving. I liked but didn't love the animation; I didn't feel that the space elements completely jived with the events that unfold on the island, but maybe that was the point. It's not enough for me to majorly dock points, but I did notice it.2I would still love to see more 2-D animated features.This is just an enjoyable little romp. I wouldn't necessarily put this on the same field with other Disney classics, as there are developments in the plot that are very easy to identify as conveniences for pacing's sake. It doesn't break out and do anything wildly new and innovative, but not every movie needs to reinvent the wheel. This is a pretty simple girl and her dog story and it hits all the emotional beats that it is supposed to. Plus, it's only 80 minutes long, so really, what have you got to lose?",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Disney Animation Film,This is a brilliant Disney animation film for all viewers to watch. It is slightly different from the other Disney animation films that have been created. The crew certainly knew what they were doing when they were creating this Disney animation film. The storyline of this Disney animation film was fine and different and strongly held itself all the way throughout this Disney animation film. The cast selection was alright enough. They did not exactly fully commit nor connect to the storyline nor to their respective characters. The chemistry that was displayed throughout this Disney animation film between the cast members could have been a lot better and stronger.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Charming Classic with a Complex Cast,"1. Concept: The premise of how family can change a living being, no matter how destructive it is, is something that clearly has potential. If you add factors like aliens, a family of two sisters without parents, and an island, then it becomes at least curious.2. Plot: There are some plot twists, although they are not argumentatively solid and give the impression of being forced. The narrative rhythm does not have an order or purpose either, so it seems random. Therefore, in general, the story is not very good, although the premise did have a lot of potential. The problem is that if you don't take care of the plot of a movie, then the rest of the factors don't help much. For this reason, I would say that this is the main limitation that the movie had. Now, something positive that I do have to add is that there are several lines of dialogue that are funny and quite entertaining.3. Characters: There is a good variety of iconic characters. For example, Pleakley, Jumba, the President, Captain Gantu, or the social worker, and that's just the supporting characters. As for the main characters, we have Stitch, who is undoubtedly the most outstanding for his personality and appearance, although we also have Lilo and Nani, who have a history and a culture that make them very interesting. Especially Lilo for her rebellious and atypical attitude.4. Complexity: What they lack in the story is compensated for by the complexity of the characters, which perfectly explains the situation of both Lilo and Nani. Well, in this case, they focus mainly on Lilo's perspective and how she faces the different difficulties they are going through. This complexity allows us to empathize with these characters and connect with their desires. In this way, we are also emotionally involved in their progress, which is quite substantial.5. Acting: Chris Sanders' voice is the key to bringing Stitch to life, as it is not just about the way he says things, but also all the noises that characterize him. Now, in general, the cast did a very good job in representing their roles.6. Aesthetics: Perhaps what had the most impact on me was the mixed style in which some environmental illustrations had texture and that allowed the characters to stand out. Apart from that, the animation seemed fluid and even cartoonish in some cases, which reminded me of the animations I saw in my childhood.7. Audio: The best thing of all is that they used Elvis as the driving force of the story, who even becomes a passive actor.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

very entertaining and visually beautiful film,"Being from Hawaii, I was expecting to see a movie filled with stereotypes and that painted some kind of unrealistic tropical paradise.  To my surprise, this is an amazing movie that really feels local.  The characters are realistic and it hard not to empathize with the family's economic struggles.  Stich is a funny character, and the loneliness and longing for family felt by both Lilo and Stitch is actually quite touching.The most impressive part of this movie, however, is the animation.  In an era when computer animation makes everything looks geometrically perfect and, frankly, fake, Lilo and Stitch is a welcome throwback to old school Disney animation.  The visuals are amazingly lush, detailed, and personal. Both children and adults are sure to enjoy this quality movie.",,Anonymous,Animation

Consider it a lighter entry in the catalog,"Disney steps outside its comfort zone with this mashup of Hawaiian culture and alien invasions. Like the toothy, sharp little blue furball at the center of all the drama, the film is loud and impulsive, recklessly chasing stray plot threads and then abruptly abandoning them for another distraction. It's far less careful and composed than the studio's usual feature work, which serves as both a positive and a negative. On one hand, it's fresh and different; a necessary (and welcome) new direction for a company that had been making movies for six-plus decades at the time. On the other, well, it just feels like something produced by the competition. It lacks that certain bit of polish, that magical sense of balance. Stitch, the aforementioned extraterrestrial beast, is a far cry from the standard Disney archetype, even in extreme circumstances. His audacious, violent nature lends itself to some impressive action scenes and a few laughs, but damages the character's sudden, climactic transition into a concerned, invested member of the family. He effectively flips a switch and wakes up, and that's not much of an arc. The human characters fare a bit better - their story has more emotional heft - but they, too, leave a lot on the table. Still, despite all that, I enjoyed myself.

charming and ingenious,"Although the animation is traditional, ""Lilo and Stitch"" is quite modern and refreshing movie. It has a charm characteristic to previous Disney productions combined with a really ingeniously-done action (the beginning and the end of the flick). Every single character is lovable - moving and hilarious at the same time. Stitch is a character which matches all the icons from classic animated films and one can utter its name along with Shrek or Duffy Duck. A very typical for such pictures message - the glorification of the family is given in a touching way and does not spoil an enormous fun. The script is full of interesting, a bit surrealistic ideas and funny dialogues. This movie is a worthy addition to the best productions of Walt Disney studio. I definitely recommend it to the whole family.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great children's movie.,"Lilo and Stitch was released in 2002, and is a very fun story about a girl and her pet alien. It has been many years since I have seen this film, and was actually pleasantly surprised when I watched it again. Of course, you have to admit that any movie about a blue, dog-like alien with a very funny voice is going to be enjoyable regardless of the rest of the movie.This is an older animated film, still in the time period of casting little-known actors in all the roles. So as far as acting goes, there isn't too much to talk about. Daveigh Chase carries the lead role in the small, bratty, and somewhat spoiled Hawaiian girl that is Lilo. She has not done many other notable films other than playing Samantha Darko in 2001's Donnie Darko, and voicing the lead in the English version of 2001's Spirited Away. Director Chris Sanders performs the unique voice of the alien Stitch, which is one of the only noteworthy acting performances. Tia Carrere and Ving Rhames also provide supporting roles in Lilo's bossy older sister Nani, and the intimidating, ex-CIA, social worker Cobra Bubbles, respectively. In any animated film the actors are rather hard to judge how great their performances are, so unless the actors cast already have some fame, not too much can be discussed here.In an animated picture there are three jobs that essentially make the entire film: the writer/director who creates the story, the animators who make it come to life and can be the main source of comedy, and the musical scorers who can set the tone for the entire movie. Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois co-wrote and co-directed Lilo and Stitch, and of the three previously mentioned areas, this is where Lilio and Stitch slacked the most. As a whole the story was good, but looking at individual parts of the story is where it fell apart. It just appeared that they tried to cram too many good ideas into 85 minutes, which to lengthen it is difficult since the target crowd is young children. I was also particularly not fond of the film's ending, I'm not a fan of musical montages in movies at all, but to close the film in that way left me with a sour taste. The animators of the film, however, did an excellent job. Granted, having aliens as the primary characters in a film does give them a much easier job to do, but nevertheless the animation was good and succeeded in making me laugh. Composer Alan Silvestri, best know for scoring his Oscar nominated Forrest Gump and the 2012 blockbuster The Avengers, gave a very pleasant score to this film incorporating both fun original compositions and a wide range of different songs from the legendary Elvis Presley. Mixing aliens with Elvis Presley was rather bold of him, but it resulted in a success and set a sun tone for the whole film.Lilo and Stitch is a great kids movie. From the funny voices of Stitch to the hilarious action scenes between him and the other aliens, it was a great creation form all the filmmakers; because what dos a kid want to do more than laugh? This makes that very easily possible for a child. Lilo and Stitch was nominated for Best Animated Film in 2003, but lost out to Daviegh Chase's other starring film Spirited Away.I give Lilo and Stitch a brought-back-memory 7.4/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
King of Disney Films!,"In cinema history there have been a few contrasting characters that have generated immense screen chemistry: `Martin & Lewis', `Nolte & Murphy', `Tucker & Chan' to name a few. The latest entry to this illustrious category is `Lilo & Stitch'. This amazing entertaining Disney film stars a Hawaiian orphan girl who befriends a ferocious alien creature. Lilo is an avid fan of Elvis Presley. Stitch is an avid fan of anything that has the capability of being torn to pieces. In other words, Stitch is no `hound dog'. Speaking of the king, Disney: I would like to `thank you very much' for inserting Elvis music into `Lilo & Stitch'. Lilo develops a `burning love' for Stitch even though he converts her house into a `break hotel'. Lilo's older sister Nina has the challenging duty of being Lilo's caretaker. Because she is a young caretaker, an exuberant social worker investigates Lilo's habitual situation. His `suspicious mind' makes him think that Lilo is not living in a suitable environment  because of Nina's unemployed situation and Stitch's anger management situation. He pressures Nina for the situations to change or he will `return to send her' a notice stating that she must `surrender' Lilo. At the same time, Stitch is `all shook up' when realizes he is being chased by aliens who have been instructed to return stitch back to his extra-terrestrial homeland. The one-eyed pursuant alien should have been instructed to have ` a little less conversation , a little more action'. `Lilo & Stitch' is by far my favorite Disney film. Some of you might say this is a bit of an overstatement and might inform me to `don't be cruel' to such Disney classics as `Cinderella', `Fantasia', and `The Lion King'. However, Disney is all about imagination and `Lilo & Stitch' is bombarded with it. So `if you are lonesome tonight', spend the evening with `Lilo & Stitch'. ***** Excellent",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Some odd choices, but still a charming film","There is a great deal of charm to Lilo & Stitch. I'm always a sucker for movies that celebrate the bonds of family, I have a fascination for movies that take place in Hawaii, and the sci-fi element doesn't hurt either. This is yet another in a never-ending line of Walt Disney films that deal with orphaned children, but I appreciated that this movie explored the real-life struggles that children face when left without parents. I also found Ving Rhames voicing the big burly social worker to be a humorous addition, while maintaining the reality of how these broken family situations can lead to problems keeping the kids together under the same roof. The odd juxtaposition of aliens tracking a runaway monster with this realistic family drama makes this film truly unique. I found most of their bumbling attempts to trap Stitch to be the funniest aspect of the film.I think where I struggle in accepting the plot structure of Lilo & Stitch is the abruptly shifting behavior of Stitch. First of all, when the doctor establishes what he was designed to do, we are supposed to view this creature as a danger to all life as we know it. Yet his behavior continues to present as merely mischievous. He never seems to desire death and destruction, just general trouble-making. I've seen April Fool's Day jokes that are more dangerous than Stitch. Then it takes relatively little time, and not much correction to turn him into an upstanding member of the family who actively tries to save Lilo's life more than once. My dog isn't even that quick to learn proper behavior, and she's not biologically programmed for evil. All that aside, for what it is, Lilo & Stitch is a high-quality film. It has a lot of heart, and plays on familiar themes in a way that should please audiences of all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brilliant!,"I think this is the best Disney movie that has come out so far.  Although the movie doesn't have the animation style as its predecessors, it has a lot to say.  The animators have taken a bold step.  Yes, that is to incorporate a very serious theme in a children's movie.  But, it still works great, and it is brilliant.Stitch is an alien being, who was put into exile due to his destructive capabilities and his inability to adapt to a normal life.  But, he escapes and lands on earth (in the state of Hawaii).  He is, then, discovered in a dog pen by a Hawaiian girl who adopts him as her pet.  It is really touching to watch how stitch learns to become a part of her family.  The essence of the movie, however, is that ""Ohana means family, and family means nobody gets left behind"".  This is mentioned again and again.  If you're sensitive enough, you might even find yourself crying, because the animators do an exceptional job of portraying feelings of guilt, loneliness and belonging. But, don't hesitate to take the kids.  This is a comedy, and they might even learn something important.All in all, great film, I give it a 10/10, although I am an adult.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Finally, misfits who actually don't fit in","Don't get me wrong.  I have nothing against most any Disney film.  Love 'em, love 'em.  But the studio's concept of a ""misfit"" has left much to be desired.  Most of their so-called misfits are actually just people with natural curiosity and ambition, placed in irrationally stifling environments.Not Lilo and Stitch.  These people are misfits because they are horribly, terribly, wonderfully wrong in the head.  I sympathize.  One of the first scenes we see of Lilo (the cute little girl in the hula skirt) is her torturing voodoo dolls of her friends.  This is, frankly, not out of character.Stitch is worse.  So much worse it's not worth my trying to describe.  The movie doesn't downplay it.  It revels in his rudeness, his malevolence and general insanity.  It's good (well, bad) fun!But that's the -wonder- of the story.  He starts off so very, very bad that it's a real journey of discovery for him to turn out even a little good. This isn't some arabian street-rat who finishes the movie plus a pretty wife and some self-esteem, but otherwise unchanged;  Stitch goes through a total metamorphosis.  It's like a how-to manual for learning to care about others. ""Selflessness for dummies""I can think of no better role-model for a young child than this screeching, cursing, loving alien.",,Anonymous,Animation

Fares even better on rewatch,"""Lilo and Stitch"" is an approachable movie because of its charms, in each of the main characters. Lilo has got to be the cutest Disney character in existence. Stitch on the other hand is a lovable spaz. And when I first watched this movie, that likability and the Elvis soundtrack made for a generally pleasing movie.All of that seems heightened on the second go-around. I clearly admit bias as Lilo reminds me of my own kid. But she has great chemistry with Stitch and it enhances the broken family story. I can't relate to that, so I don't know how realistic it really is - but it's emotionally effective and it's not overdone.This is top-tier (modern) Disney, with surprising wit and an ideal voice cast.

Lilo & Nani,"The connection between Lilo and Nani is what steals the show. Stitch is what sells all the merchandise, but the heart of the movie rests on Lilo and Nani.

Since rewatching the film many times through the years, I find that she is accurate to how little kids act. She can be annoying sometimes, but really sweet at other times.Chris Sanders and Dean Debois had a unique vision for the film, and Disney had uncharacteristically little interference with the project.

When the alien lands on Earth, Lilo mistakes him as a dog and adopts him, naming him Stitch.While her older sister struggles to get employed, Lilo tries to get Stitch to become a model citizen using Elvis as the model of a fine citizen.  But Stitch can't help but be himself, which means wreaking havoc on most everything!Chris Sanders, animator and director of ""Mulan"" as well as the creator and voice of ""Stitch"" directs this movie to Disney Classic stardom.

All be said, the people who brought us Mickey Mouse have created yet another memorable character in Stitch. Sure, the movie was your typical kiddie movie, but there proved to be never be a dull moment.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worse than The Black Cauldron? HA!,"This movie reaffirmed my belief that the critics are nothing but a big bunch of paid-off, self-absorbed idiots. This is possibly the single most underrated animated movie ever created, surpassing a level of underratedness of even the great masterpiece of 1981, The Fox and the Hound. Lilo and Stitch is not merely a mild cartoon flick with Saturday morning level animation. This is an outstanding flick with gorgeous animation. It is bouncy, engaging, shockingly heartwarming and stunningly sincere. These are all traits I enjoyed in The Fox and the Hound that I find in few other animated movies. Here, there are no good guys or bad guys, just a group of characters, some realistic, others cartoony, playing out one of the most beautifully simple and simply beautiful stories I've ever seen in a Disney movie.I've always enjoyed an animated movie than didn't try to make a big deal out of everything, hence my love of The Fox and the Hound and now this movie. Not everything needs be laugh-yourself-silly funny. Nor does everything need to have slick computer graphics or obnoxiously detailed animation. Don't get me wrong, though, Lilo and Stitch has wonderful animation. It is reminiscent of the earlier days of Disney where the animation was simple yet fluid and beautiful and the backgrounds were joys to behold. Here, the backgrounds are watercolors, like in the Disney movies of old. While I have a small hunch a few computer graphics might have been used, mainly in this movie watercolor backgrounds were used where in any other animated movie, a computer generated image would've been used, and the result is a hundred times more beautiful and effective.Some of the things I find fault with most of modern Disney after The Little Mermaid include sappiness, bad and overblown musical numbers, insistance on jokey humor, fake or set up climaxes, and an even bigger instance on putting said jokey humor inside a dramatic scene, weakening its impact and making it feel fake or set up. Lilo and Stitch has none of that. It's never sappy. There are no musical numbers other than Elvis songs, beautiful Hawaiian music, and a touching lullaby. The humor is very funny but character driven. The climax is very entertaining and exciting and nowhere near as ridiculous as many Little Mermaid era Disney fight or chase scenes, and there are no rude interruptions of unnecessary parts.As far as I'm concerned, you can take movies like Tarzan and Hunchback of Notre Dame and just flush them down the toilet. If you think the best thing to happen to animation in a while are movies like Shrek, Ice Age, or Monsters, Inc., guess again. This it right here. I doubt it will win Best Animated Movie at the Oscars, but not only do I feel it should win, but I also believe it should be the Best Movie of the year. While all the critics are going gaga over this year's loud and obnoxious action films, Star Wars Ep II included, Lilo and Stitch reaffirms basic values and never forgets true storytelling. To sum it up, if you only need to see one movie this year, see Lilo and Stitch. If you only need to see one animated movie this year, despite what critics like Berardinelli seem to think, skip Spirit and see Lilo and Stitch. I confidently call it the best animated movie anyone's ever done since The Fox and the Hound and deserves no less than a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Commentary on the comments and an overall review.,"""Lilo & Stitch"" was a good movie with positive values, and while I certainly don't fault anyone who sees it another way, I do have a few points to list in its defence.1)  The ""adult"" themes.  Do we really have to shelter our children from the cold, hard facts of the real world?  If anything, this movie opens up questions about real family problems that kids NEED to learn about.  Where was Mr. Bubbles going to take Lilo?  What happened to Nani and Lilo's family?  Kids need to know that bad things can and do happen -- maybe they can glean understanding of the real world from the people they trust most: their parents.  This film does little but expose children to the realistic view that sometimes, things really aren't so peachy after all.  If parents think these ideas are too ""mature"" for their children, perhaps they should take a good long look at what kind of life expectations they're giving these kids.  (I'm NOT saying we should be sitting three-year-olds down and telling them, sometimes kids get taken away from their mommies and daddies.  There is an appropriate age for such revelations, but often it's quite earlier than parents seem to think.)2)  The ""violence.""  This is a PG-rated movie.  (For non-American viewers, most Disney movies are rated ""G,"" which means ""for general audiences"" -- in most cases a family movie with little controversial elements in it.  ""PG"" means ""parental guidance,"" indicating that, though still likely appropriate for children, the movie does have some things that parents might not want younger children to see.)  Yes, it's animated, but so was Princess Mononoke (a Japanese film released in the US around 1997), and it certainly wasn't a children's movie, now, was it?  There are things in PG-rated movies that you wouldn't want your kids to see, and violence is one of them.  ..Of course, then again, the violence was presented in a slapstick, Bugs Bunny kind of way, though original in its own right; there was absolutely no instance of gore or blood and the space-guns looked as though they were spewing Jell-O rather than some volatile substance.  You'll find worse on afternoon children's programming, I can assure you.3)  ""Inappropriateness.""  This isn't a movie simply for children. Granted, there are instances which may be inappropriate for young children who cannot yet understand the concept of foster care or death.  But look at a lot of other recent animated films -- Don Bluth's ""All Dogs Go to Heaven"" springs to mind.  I went to see this movie in the theatre when I was six years old and left with nary a CLUE of what had happened.  I recently picked it up from the movie rental and found all sorts of hidden jokes, plot themes and circumstances which passed right over my head before.  I can say comfortably that, had Lilo & Stitch come out in 1989, I would be rediscovering it in much the same way.  The compex themes would suggest this movie be aimed at children at LEAST eight years old, but there is little harm in taking younger ones to see it.4)  Lilo's behaviour.  Yes, Lilo was a brat.  Yes, she had a good reason, and yes, she was acting like a normal child.  Children go through all sorts of horrible things, and they react accordingly, often developing serious behavioural problems.  Lilo's springs from her parents' death and her and her sister's, as another reviewer put it, inability to recover from this grief.  A glance at the children on your own child's playground, even in the most upstanding of communities, presents an array of children, some with serious problems, even some children who are in trouble with the law or come from, god forbid, ""broken families.""  If I may interject here with my own opinion of Lilo, it is that I liked her; it was refreshing to see a Disney child who wasn't an upstanding citizen like the children from The Rescuers duo, Pinnochio, The Jungle Book, and the various animal children from movies like The Lion King, Bambi, and The Aristocats.  Lilo acted like a real child.  (Kudos to ""Treasure Planet"" for its portrayal of Jim as a juvenile ""delinquent"" as well.)In conclusion, Disney has gone a great way and provided a film that, despite its science fiction backings, is quite a bit more real than other classics it's thrown our way.  True, there are instances that might be considered ""mushy,"" and there are instances that might baffle or frighten younger children, but overall there is very little cushion between the audience and the raw facts of Lilo's situation.",,Anonymous,Animation

Disney's back in da house.,"This is without doubt Disney's best in recent years.  I have nothing but praise for this film, and it finally seems that Disney is back on track. Whether or not they can keep it up remains to be seen, but Lilo and Stitch was worth every cent of admission and it will definitely be joining my DVD collection.The animation is beautifully done, though the animators aren't trying to dazzle your pants off - it was refreshing.  But what really stands out about this film is both the story and the cast of characters.  The story sucked me in right from the start and I was more than happy to go along for the ride. This is thanks mostly to the characters.  They're all memorable and endearing creations, and for most of the film you will be cracking up in your seat at the onscreen antics.  While this film is aimed at kids (hello, Disney), don't let that put you off as adults will be just as entertained. I was even surprised at a lot of the humor, it didn't seem so childish as you might expect.

Strange Concoction,"I'll not fault Disney for trying something new, but this strange concoction of a movie left me ambivalent. My 9-year-old laughed in places and appreciated the overall message of inclusion, but even he had to admit that it was more than a little on the weird side. The broken family relationships that begin the story make this cartoon much too dark for small children. The theatre was of course filled with small tykes due to the Disney brand. They didn't seem to pick up on the pop culture references, nor did they laugh all that much at the antics. The behavioral problems Lilo and Stitch exhibit near the beginning of the film (biting, hitting, spitting, etc.) ought to make any parent think twice before taking an impressionable child or at least be prepared to talk it through. All in all, its not as anti-children as ""Antz"" or ""Shrek"", but its far from being the funfest that the media fanfare seems to be promising.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

More Violent than Expected,"This animated Disney film aimed at little kids is more violent than I expected.  I think the screenwriters sat down and tried to include some elements that would appeal to boys and others to appeal to girls.   So, first the film is about outer space, with lots of ugly monsters and evil characters and shooting and space ships and things being blown up.  Then the movie shifts into a tale about girls with dolls and big wheels, and human interaction involving a little girl being raised by her sister.Everything about this movie shouts: We need to make a movie that will not be too offensive for watchful parents and critics, and yet appeal to little boys and girls.  The movie has bits of humor for the adults who are stuck seeing it, as well as perky music that gets the toes tapping.  This movie is a safe summer moneymaker, but it is not any extension of creativity, and will never be a ""classic.""  Toys based on the film are for sale in stores, and they are cute.  If you think McDonald's serves acceptable ""food,"" you will probably think this is acceptable ""entertainment.""",,Anonymous,Animation
The Great Disney Company is Back.,"Seeing this wonderful film, I was amazed with everything. The story is fresh and delightful, the animation is very beautiful and the characters are all entertaining especially Stitch. The relationship between Lilo and Nani is very powerful because there trying to become a family and also trying to take care of each other. Chris Sanders came up with the idea for this, I hope we see more of his writting and directing in the future of this company. Disney hits a big home run with this animated classic which they haven't done since The Lion King. No wonder this was acclaim and a Box-Office hit. There's nothing more I could say about this wonderful film. Kids and Parents should see this together. Is hard to say if this is gonna be remember like other great animated movies because I'm never gonna forget it.(A-).",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best films Disney has made in decades,"Lilo & Stitch is something of an oddball for a Disney film. After Emperor's New Groove and Atlantis had failed to bring in the kind of money needed to make them successful, Lilo & Stitch was given a much smaller budget, but also a lot more freedom when it came to story and style. The end result is something you almost wouldn't recognize as a Disney film if you didn't know better. But I mean that in a good way.The story goes that an extra-terrestrial space government sentences a dangerous lifeform simply known as Experiment 626 to an exile on a lonely asteroid. Unfortunately, or fortunately depending on the point of view, the lifeform, about to be known as Stitch, escapes and ends up in Hawaii on planet Earth. There he meets a little native girl known as Lilo, who ends up adopting him as her new ""dog"". The story shifts between the two story lines about Stitch being hunted by the space government and Lilo being potentially taken away by social workers because her parents have died and her sister is struggling to take care of her.The plot alone would make this an intriguing film, but what really makes this such a wonderful movie is its warmth and maturity. Nani, Lilo's older sister, is not a bad person, despite being unable to take care of her sister properly. Instead she's shown as being a very brave young woman who has been pushed into an impossible situation. I like the maturity that shows on the film makers's part a lot. Lilo and Stitch are also very good characters, shifting effortlessly between typical Disney antics and surprising bouts of tangible maturity.The story itself is rather basic, given the ludicrous setting. Nothing all that surprising or unexpected happens, but it doesn't have to. It's not that kind of film. It's a film you see for the characters and the emotions. For the message. And all those are spot on.I also really like the visuals. It's not animated in the usual Disney style, but you can see enough of it for it to feel familiar. And all the new stuff being brought in works very well for the film's advantage, giving it a lot of energy and soul. Sure, it's not on bar with, say, Tarzan or Sleeping Beauty in terms of animation, but given the small budget, I'm more than impressed. The score is also nice, featuring songs by Elvis in addition to some new songs that evoke the feel of Hawaii.This is a great film no matter how you look at it. Its heart and warmth will stay with you for a long time and it was one of the first signs that Disney could still make great films even in the new century. See it, if you haven't already.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Absolutely Awful,"I am a HUGE Disney fan and I love, or at least like pretty much every movie they make (crappy live action remakes not included) but for some reason I have always avoided this film. For some reason I just knew I'd hate it.Well nearly 20 years after release I finally was convinced to sit down and watch it and my god it was worse than I could have possibly imagined. Lilo was the most irritating creation Disney has ever concocted. In fact not just irritating, bordering on psychopathic.

Stitch is SO cool. the Lilo character is well-acted too.  i personally love the way Disney is going with its animation.

Disney getting it right,"Disney has alway gone through its learning and finding itself time and then getting it right.  After years of concentrating mostly on childrens stories and the like, Disney started breaking the mold with the Emperors New Groove, interesting but lacking in parts.  A good start but not it. Atlantis filled in some of the blanks, but by missing Disney's traditional market mas not it.Like Oliver and The Great Mouse Detective lead to the Little Mermaid, Beauty, and others.  The others have built into Lilo and Stitch an idea based story something fairly new to Disney, but they showed they learned and pulled it off.An enjoyable afternoon was spent by the family ages 3 and up.  The youngest for the first time was enjoying it enough to get off daddy's lap and sit in her own seat and laugh.  She even caught the family and no one was left behind, quoting it to her mother the next day.A little action, a message, and alot of imagination.  8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An unattractive character that manages to become undeniably cute,"The original theatrical poster of Disney's Lilo and Stitch is one that perfectly compliments the picture itself using very, very few words. It shows many of the iconic Disney characters, from Pinocchio to Aladdin, Beauty to the Beast, staring at poor little Stitch who is firmly planted in the center of the poster, looking at the audience and optimistically smiling. This is one of the first times Disney willingly marketed a character that wasn't too presentable in quality, but after staring at his unique blue self for about a half hour, you begin to see the beauty in him, and by the end, he firmly clings to your heart.Lilo and Stitch is one of the brightest, cleanest, and cheerfully different Disney pictures I have seen, and one of the company's bravest of the decade next to Atlantis: The Lost Empire. Unlike that picture, which resulted in a disappointing performance at the box office because of its different look and crisper, more adult-like style, Lilo and Stitch shot and scored with audiences and revenue, and dare I say, was one of their best films of the decade.The story begins with Dr. Jumba Jookiba (voiced by David Ogden Stiers), who is on trial for his latest illegal genetic experiment. The creature, dubbed ""Experiment 626,"" is a pint-sized, blue, dog-like creation, aggressive, obnoxious, and very, very sneaky. After being forced to be executed, 626 manages to escape to Earth, crash-landing on Kauai, a small island of Hawaii.It is there where we meet Lilo (Daveigh Chase), a likable, yet alienated soul who is taken care of by her nineteen year old sister Nani (Carrere) after her parents' tragic death. The pair is constantly interrupted by Cobra Bubbles, voiced to perfection by Ving Rhames, a tall, ominous, and intimidating social worker, concerned that Lilo may not be in the best care with Nani, and is planning to move her to a foster home if conditions aren't up to his standards.Frustrated when Lilo's alienation worsens, Nani takes her to an animal shelter, where she finds Experiment 626, who was taken there after being hit by a truck late in the night. She adopts and names 626 ""Stitch"" and they quickly become best friends. The creature, at first, is ill-behaved and lawless, worse than any dog one could have. But later on, he develops heart and, what was originally intended to be a plan of cunning instincts, being taken under the wing of an innocent girl to be protected from Dr. Jumba and his bumbling sidekick Agent Pleakley (McDonald), becomes a truly real story of family (or ""ohana"" in this case) devotion, self-worth, love, and a keenly observant lesson in philosophy. This story is appealing to everyone, and for a while, it seemed that Pixar was light years ahead of Disney, while at this point in time, they were neck and neck.The animation is beautifully rendered and bleeds classic style. This was, again, the time period where animation was changing. Pixar invented the ""full length CGI feature"" idea, and it was at this point in time where movies of both the classic, hand drawn vibe were being released, as well as newly invented computer animated features. This proved to many that despite flashy tech-work and glossy colors, that it is the story that matters, and that Disney was still able to deliver a rich, compelling feature of depth and heart.Lilo and Stitch is simply a wonderful film. It packs in undying morals to accompany its premise, never seems to become more interested in awkward sentimentality and witty one-liners, and always seems focused, sophisticated, and effervescent in its idea of ""doing what it can with what it has."" It has brilliant voice actors, elegance in its art direction, a smooth script, and a touching and sometimes poignant story that serves as a feast for the heart. It is an absolute treat.Voiced by: Daveigh Chase, Chris Sanders, Tia Carrere, David Ogden Stiers, Kevin McDonald, Ving Rhames, and Jason Scott Lee. Directed by: Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mazzy fun!,if there is one thing I love about some Disney movies today is the level of realism involved as opposed to my day I went with three other people around my age and found we laughed more than my seven year old niece but it still is a movie for children which makes it so good. the movie is about a little girl with an attitude named Lilo and her equally mind-set sister nani shortly after lilo wishes for a pet enters stich lilo instantly falls in love with the destrucive animal only to discover he's a hawaiian space dog sent to destroy the earth. this movie also adds the sorrow of custody woes some children may find to sad but this is otherwise a good movie for kids and adults (with kids),,Anonymous,Animation
Not that great - rather disappointing,"Lilo and Stitch was disjointed and not particularly funny.  My kids liked it - however, I found it to be disappointing.

My favorite Disney movie ever!,"I haven't been a fan of traditionally animated Disney movies for many years. Sure, some have been great to see once or twice (Mulan, Tarzan, Beauty and the Beast), but some I regret taking the time seeing (Hercules).  Out of the Classics, Bambi always stood out for me as a favorite, but even so, I don't yet own the DVD.  But Lilo & Stitch has quickly jumped to the forefront as my favorite Disney movie ever.  Why?  Because it's got heart and edge yet avoided the sappy sentimentality and stuped one-liners.  Stitch and Lilo complement each other well.  They're both adorable, even when they're getting into trouble.  These characters aren't perfect nor completely evil. They're just like the rest of us...a little of both.  But they want to be a part of something where they can belong.  Ohana works for them.  It works for me.Kudos to Disney for not making this film by committee and letting two amazing artists create their vision on their own.  It makes a difference!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Humorous and Deeply Charged!,"First of all, bravo to Disney for bringing something so REAL world and REAL time to the big screen focusing on something that we all truly need, a reality check on the importance and value of ""family"" ( ""Ohana"" ). Bravo to this gem of a movie, destined to be a classic for it's humor, but especially for its message that it gets across with such clarity and deeply charged emotion, and I mean, EMOTION ! A characteristic of real true Disney fashion. I've seen it three times, and there are quite a few deep moments that bring a definite lump in the throat and mist to the eye. Believe me, if there is any person whose heart is not touched in any way in the way this movie intends to do, or if there is no positive effect felt by that person's heart from this movie, then there must truly be something not right with that person's heart. And bravo to all those that gave this movie AT LEAST 4 stars ( maximum of 5 from the other review board from where this review came from).Bravo to anyone giving this movie at least 8 stars on this review board. Anything less means you're not looking deep enough into the work that went on behind the scenes and in the hearts of all those who made this movie possible. The majority of the raves and reviews reflects only part of the reason why there will be a sequel made for VHS/DVD for TV for next year as well as a TV series and then a second sequel in 2004. If anyone cannot get the message that this film is trying reach out to you with, then you're can't be looking for the right thing. I give Lilo & Stitch my max - 10 stars Also to you Ronzo-4 whose review I read - Bravo to you for seeing exactly what the writers, producers, directors,and all involved wanted you to see, and feel. As you quoted from the movie, ""Ohana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind. Or forgotten"". ( You forgot that end part Ronzo - no problem )A message that we really need to give a greater re-awakening to on its value, importance, and power, and all that it embodies. One of love's greatest symbols has to represented in the meaning of Ohana / Family. And from what research the writers Sanders and Deblois did in Hawaii /Kuaii, uncovered what they testified to be very STRONG community / family ties in that area. What an example to write into this movie. And it is also great to see how they honored the Hawaiian culture properly in the artistry, the music, the characters in this movie. Using what they termed as colorwashing the Hawaiian scenery in watercolor did bring back a 60 year old style not seen since days of Dumbo, Pinnochio, and Bambi. All in all this movie will go on and further in its theming, and future continuation through sequels and tv series, & franchising, all rooted in the memories that this original has placed deeply enough into all those who loved enough to create it for all the right reasons, and all those who loved enough to hear what it has to say.

Great story-telling and something fresh again from Disney ...,"I thought I would LIKE this movie but I loved it!  I got to go to a special preview the day before the LA Premiere.  The audience was mixed with children and adults of all ages and ethnicity.The Hawaiian choir was there that performed in the movie as well as lots of Disney employees, Wynonna Judd and the A-Teens, who sang songs from the film.I have to say that this is the best animated film since Lion King.  From the writer of Mulan, this is ""based on an idea"", and the idea works very well.The film doesn't rely on the Disney tradition of a song every seven to eight minutes.  When they come they fit in, maybe because they are NOT sung by the characters.  Whether it is background music from Alan Silvestri, or the beautiful Hawaiian music, it is extremely good and enjoyable.The story is a mix of sci-fi and a little Hawaiian family trouble with Lilo & Stitch - a young mischevious girl under the care of her older sister and a somewhat cute and dangerous blue fellow from one of the galactic federation planets. When the film gets emotional it has much more impact because of the way that it comes from nowhere.  It's not at the end of a refrain or song so it is always not expected.Adults will love the film as much as kids with several movie references during the piece.  A refreshing story with good production from the animators in Florida, I hope we see much more of this type of animated fare.I think it could be some time before we see this ""type of animation"" again. It's doesn't take cheap shots like Dreamworks ""Shrek"" and still entertains everyone. Maybe the folks at Disney will do a sequel direct to theaters instead of video, i.e. Lion King and Aladdin.

Wonderfully Imperfect,"I went to see Lilo and Stitch yesterday. Let me tell you straight off, it was worth the admission fee. Every single cent.I was amazed at just how different, refreshing and enchanting this film was. It is not only set in a location never used by Disney before but has a style of animation that is not only beautiful but interesting. There are no perfectly proportioned faces or bodies, even in the humans. I'm not going to say that the characters look realistic, but they are a lot more realistic than Snow White and Belle in their simple imperfection.There are no Disney musical numbers, not typical ones, anyway, and this seemed right. It would have been disheartening to grow to understand, perhaps love these characters and then see them launch into a verse of ""a whole new world"".From the beginning you could tell this was not going to be a normal Disney film. Apart from the straight-to-video release of ""Buzz Lightyear"", this was Disney tackling something they had never done in a film before. Extra Terrestrials.These new characters and characterisations are astounding. Hilarious. Well crafted and well executed. Who wouldn't be scared of the Captain voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson (seriously, you should hear that man roar...  it is terrifying). Who wouldn't find Stitch (Chris Sanders) offensive yet funny?I thought the voice acting was brilliant and I am very impressed with Lilo's voice artist Daveigh Chase who has also done the voice of Chihiro in the American dub of ""Spirited Away"".The animation is beautiful. I have never been to Hawaii, but now I have a determination to go. The backdrops, the characters, the way they move. It is all unique to this film.The storyline is well developed, simple to understand and the themes surrounding it are obvious. Love. Friendship. Family. Community. No-one gets left behind. These are integral to the spell which Lilo and Stitch casts on you whilst watching. I didn't look at my watch once, and even if I'm enjoying a film, I usually do.The film follows Lilo and her sister Nani as they try to keep their family together whilst contending with not only interstellar nuisances but social services authority, Mr Bubbles (Ving Rhames). I won't give any more away, because, let's face it. Everyone else has anyway.I didn't think I would say this about a Disney feature again, what with half-thought-out sequels being released every which-way, but this film deserves 10/10.

All the good parts are in the trailer (5/10),"[I saw this in the theater, YMMV]This often happens, but rarely with a Disney movie -- all the good parts are already in the trailer.This is not a particularly complex film, even by Disney standards.  Several times in the plot the writers paint themselves into a corner and have to do some hand waving to keep the movie going.The scientist chasing Stitch (Dr. Jumba) is intent on the capture of Stitch and will settle for his destruction.  But all Stitch has to do is to mumble the word ""family"" at Dr. Jumba and for some completely inexplicable reason the scientist joins Stitch on his quest to join a family.  Another example is Mr. Bubbles, the social worker.  Mr. Bubbles is the largest, wealthiest, most leasurely social worker on the planet.  Hawaii must have a very light caseload.  In addition, since there are aliens zooming around Hawaii and someone is bound to notice, Mr. Bubbles conveniently becomes an ex-CIA Area 51 agent (who also just happens to know the head alien when she arrives).There is some references to ""family"" and ""aloha"",  But the producers lost their nerve when they added a toss-off reference to fat people as beautiful, but placed it inside a joke.This is not particularly funny, cute, or moraly uplifting.  It is just 90 minutes of ""cute and fluffy"" (as Stitch refers to him(her?)self.)",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
An ugly alien and a orphaned girl. Who knew it would be so good?,"A tall blue alien is walking toward a podium, surrounded by a stadium of aliens. One chubby purple alien with a strange accent and 4 eyes stands in front of her on a high, floating platform. A giant alien is told to read the charges, and he announces that the chubby purple alien has been accused of experimentation on a genetic level. It is announced that they believe he had created something, and a covered floating platform rises a few feet to the chubby alien's side. It is revealed under the covering a blue, 2-armed alien with large blue eyes, huge ears, and a smirk on his face.Lilo & Stitch follows the adventures of two beings who meet up. Lilo is a 6-year-old depressed Hawaiian girl who listens to Elvis. Indeed, after the action-oriented introductory first 10-minutes, we do feel more than a little heartbroken for a while. She has no parents, and her sister, although good at taking care of her, does have some bad luck with a certain day and a certain man sent to check in on them.Stitch is the experiment. Made to be destructive, he lands on Earth after a daring escape(or a lucky escape, whatever your look)and starts going through some tough times when he finds Hawaii has no large cities.After an hour, Stitch is in Lilo's care in a last ditch effort for Lilo to stop being depressed in front of the service man, named Cobra Bubbles. With nothing to destroy, Stitch must look for the next greatest meaning he can find. That, is the center of this story: family.Ohana means family. Family means no one gets left behind, or forgotten.Stitch turns to a very short version of The Ugly Duckling in a Nursury Rhymes book, and starts relating to the lost bird.Finally, many aliens sent to capture Stitch, or Experiment 626, meet up, in a grand explosion, a serious time, and a slightly confusing action battle.Stitch, who had brought in his alien features to slightly resemble a dog, does eventually grow on you, he's super cute by the end, and you're happy to know a second movie, more of a prequel, is being made probably featuring the little guy. And you gotta love his voice. It is forgotten in a 50 minute period of growling, but you won't not be able to hear it enough eventually.Lilo, though amusing, seems to be missing something, yet she is enough for one movie.The first exclusively water-colour background Disney movie since Dumbo looks amazing, if you are slightly put off by the cartoonish look. The emotion and story is far beyond anything expected, especially for a Disney movie. And, though some seems trailed, the actual execution of the plot is almost up to it's fullest, with a few tweaks here and there. And I do want to see Stitch again, if not Lilo.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney gives us something old and something new to try to expand their horizons (and longevity) and it works pretty well.,"Instead of trying to keep up with or outdo the popular Pixar (""Shrek"", ""Monsters, Inc."") technology, Disney has reverted back to the old days of watercolors for what they hope will be their next blockbuster. With a daring ad campaign that puts ""Stitch"", the destructive yet cute koala-looking alien, amongst classic Disney characters like Snow White and Ariel (""The Little Mermaid""), it smells like Mickey has a new franchise in the works. The movie, however, is less than traditional. In fact, the themes at times seem a little too heavy or realistic for a typical Disney feature.For example, you'll see Lilo, the not so cuddly little girl, bite other kids, alienate herself from others, and defy authority. She is being raised by her job-hopping sister, Nani (voiced by Tia Carrere), because her parents were killed in an accident and there's constantly a threat of a social service ""thug"" (voiced by Ving Rhames) coming by to take Lilo away. The point, though, is that no matter who it is in your life, it's important to have ""ohana"" (family). It's nice to see that Disney is acknowledging different types of modern lifestyles, although part of the Disney magic is the escapism that's really not present here. Not that every one has to be heads-in-the-clouds entertainment, but sometimes that's why folks go to the movies after all, isn't it?It almost seems aimed at a more mature audience, referencing slightly older films like ""Jaws"" and ""Star Trek"", while having almost only old Elvis Presley songs in the soundtrack. That's right, no singing or dancing here, just a little dialogue-less destructive alien and a dysfunctional kid in Hawaii trying to find their place in the world.Writer/director Chris Sanders (""Mulan"") and co-director Dean Deblois are fairly new to the game, but that's probably what Disney needs. The sugary-sweet animated almost-musicals that have worked in the past needed a little updating and rethinking to connect with kids today and it seems to have worked. This is one that kids and adults can enjoy alike. While probably not destined for the ""classic"" tag that the company is hoping for, it's still pretty entertaining. If this sounds interesting to you, check it out. If you're expecting big musical numbers and sweet, loveable characters, you might do best with the older Disney films.",,Anonymous,Animation

Think of ""Stitch"" as an alien on steroids, and you'll get an idea that this animated movie is no ""E.T."".

More Daring Than Most Disney Presentations,"Brimming with emotional honesty & character flaws which in turn only makes the ride all the more heartfelt & human, Lilo & Stitch presents Walt Disney Animation Studios stepping out of its comfort zone to deliver a rich, riotous & refreshing tale about family, belonging & power of nurturing which definitely ranks amongst the lesser appreciated gems in Disney canon.Written & directed by Chris Sanders & Dean DeBlois (best known for How To Train Your Dragon), the film marks their directorial debuts and is a wonderfully layered, beautifully animated & sincerely crafted effort that finds the directing duo taking actual risk instead of playing it safe by going for a storytelling treatment that lies a little outside of Disney's established formula.There is greater emphasis on its characters & their relationships plus it embraces the broken fragments wholeheartedly, thus resulting in more dramatic depth & better resonance with the viewers. And it achieves all that without sacrificing its amusing wit or entertainment value. The final act does fall short on expectations but the human drama remains compelling from start to finish.Overall, Lilo & Stitch is a smartly scripted & neatly directed delight that will strike a better chord with grown-ups than kids, and has aged real fine over the years. Its familial themes are sensibly explored and it goes more in-depth than most Disney presentations. Promising a fun, enjoyable, adventurous & rewarding fare for most if not all, this animated sci-fi dramedy is absolutely worth your time & money.",,Anonymous,Animation

"Cute, quirky, hysterical, original, charming, poignant","That's a list of just a few of the words that come to mind when I consider this movie.  It's an absolutely delight to watch.  Though essentially a children's movie, I see no reason why an adult can't enjoy it.  There's plenty of subtle humor.This movie simply has everything.  Though ""ohana"" is repeated a few too many times, one can't help but appreciate the message.These are also some of Disney's more interesting characters.  What other Disney movie has an evil alien and a girl that makes voodoo dolls?The animation is exceptional.

Excellent,"Took my two boys (5 & 8) to this film today.  Very enjoyable and very funny. Tia Carrere's voice sounded really young and very believable.  I thought the people of Hawaii would like how they were represented in this film.  The boys sat relatively still through the entire movie, which indicates to me that they were really into it (they jacked around quite a bit during Spiderman and Star Wars).I think that this is why we keep going back for Disney movies, as it was good for both adults and kids.

Lilo and Stitch: 4/10,"I don't really like the company of Disney, but sometimes they make movies that surprise me with their quality (Monsters, Inc., The Lion King). Their animated films can be quite good. Note the word `can'.Lilo, voiced by Daveigh Chase (The Ring), is a five-year-old Hawaiian girl who is being raised by her older sister Nani, voiced by Tia Carrere. Lilo and Nani's parents died.Meanwhile, in space, project 626 (voice of Chris Sanders) was made to be a vicious killing machine thing. When it escapes, it falls to Earth, while two bumbling aliens try to get it. 626 is found by Lilo and is named Stitch (hence the name Lilo and Stitch). The movie is about their so-called `adventures'.First off, Lilo and Stitch tries to hard. It tries too hard to be funny, to appeal to all age brackets, and to bring back the appeal of the early 90s, when such movies like Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King were deemed best of the best. Sure I laughed a few times, but not enough. Its rather gross humor at times (Stitch licking the inside of his nose, getting apparatus from the nose and eating it) didn't appeal to me at all. Adults would find that revolting, though kids would crack up. Why did they use lavish watercolors instead of CGI? Maybe so they can go up to Dreamworks and say `WE don't need computers to make a movie!' Lilo and Stitch would have worked better as a computer generated movie for some reason. It just seemed out of place to use blue-collar work.Ving Rhames comes in (!) as a social worker named Cobra Bubbles (generating one of the few laughs I protruded) and wants to take Lilo away from Nani. Gasp! O no! We really know them so well to care!And that is where my second point comes in. It seems to abandon many plot elements along the way. Lilo runs into a hula dance lesson, but is never seen dancing again. Why aren't we told more about the parents (or would that be too harsh for the young ones who really pay attention to every word said)? David (Jason Scott Lee), a young man, seems to come and go and is introduced without any knowledge. Why is he here and why aren't we told about him at all?Also, they tried to `dumb it down' a little. Why should we hate a man doing his job (Mr. Bubbles)? We obviously see that Nani is not being a very good parent, so why should we care that they are going to be separated? It's for the best. Too much slapstick even for me. Wow-kids fall. Hahaha. What was the purpose of putting songs from Elvis in? Could it be that it's a musical but those smart folks at Disney couldn't think of any songs to put in? Well, duh!You may think I totally hate it now, but it is watchable and, as I said before, a little funny. Its whole space theme, I just didn't think should have been put in there. It seemed to not fit along with the remote Hawaiian island theme (but fish-out-of-water, I guess). Lilo and Stitch is harmless kid's fare, but avoid if possible if you have half a usable mind.My rating: 4/10Rated PG for mild sci-fi action.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Loved it,"The movie's a breath of fresh air not only in its setting - it's set on the Hawaiian island of Kauai - but also in its characters; Lilo is a little girl being brought up by her big sister Nani following their parents' death (offscreen), and the movie's not afraid to indicate that it's tough for both of them. They, along with their social worker Cobra Bubbles and friend David, constitute a rare sighting of proper human beings in Disney cartoons (see also, surprisingly, Lucky Piquel from ""Bonkers""), the reward writer-directors Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois get for putting the emphasis on the emotions rather than on the chase element of the plot (Stitch/Experiment 626 was created by a scientist in violation of the laws of his planet; when Stitch escaped, his creator and an ""E-arth"" expert were sent to bring him back) or on the potential for slapstick - though it's there and it's certainly used, the focus is purely on heart.The realness of the movie means that ""Lilo & Stitch"" often feels like a live action movie that just happens to be drawn (at one point Stitch sees a 1950s SF movie on TV, and the movie in question is shown as a genuine film clip). Usually that's a bad thing if the 'toon in question strives to be realistic, but in this case there are so many elements that don't come naturally - seen any koala/dog hybrid-Elvis Presley wannabes on the beach lately? - that it still works. If there's a downside, it's that the scenes of the alien pursuers are for the most part almost a distraction... but even then the human element ups the involvement, with the added bonus of there being no real ""bad guys"" per se (yes, I said bonus - it's nice to see a Disney movie where there isn't a traditional black-hatted villain, just people doing their jobs).",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The best Animated film of the year, the Oscars should take note!","I just sat through a matinee of Lilo & Stitch, a movie I really have been anticipating to see; being the cartoon freak I am.If you like Spirit, you'll hate this, because it is a lot more weird, hip, slightly more violent, and has more heart. Why? Well, it makes you laugh as well as get to your heart more than Spirit probably would; but without turning the film into a piece of sentimental fluff.The animation is also cool as well. Finally, an 2D animated film that uses CGI as a supplement for a couple of shots rather than unnecessarily using it. It blends together with the 2D animation really well, the backgrounds look nice and lush, and the designs look simple enough but likeable because they don't try to look really slick.The characters are for once fresh. They aren't generic characters, they are likeable developed characters, they aren't characters that are cloying comic reliefs that we all have seen before in other films, they are NEW! Oh yeah, and Stitch kicks @$$.And the humor. Well, it's funny! This movie really doesn't depend on humor most of the time, but when it comes in, it really does! It isn't from comic reliefs, not from one-liners, but sight gags and physical humor. The running gags with the Elvis tunes and guy with the ice cream cone are simply cool!And plus, the sound and music! The Dolby Digital sound in the theater was set up very nicely, with the revving-at-times sound effects of blasts, ambiance, and dialogue simply pumped. You could almost feel it! As for the music, nobody bursts into a song! It's mostly cool Elvis tunes (yay!) and some Hawaiian tunes.It is very rare when a animated film nowadays hits the spot that Lilo and Stitch does: masterpiece! Classic! Brilliant! These films only come around every 10 or so years, the last being Nightmare Before Christmas. Between this and NBC, there are many excellent near-classics that came around (mostly from Pixar) that get a 10/10 in my book; but they really aren't able to reach this level of genius. 11/10. Oh yeah, I'll say it again: Stitch kicks @$$! Oh, and make sure you catch this in the theater on the VERY next screening of it if you have yet to see it. Do it now! The DVD will be great but it won't have the theatrical impact it did on me and many others. Come on you guys who have yet to see it, you got to bump up more ratings on the masterpiece so it can get on the Top 250. You don't know when the next animated masterpiece of the decade will come! This film needs more than the current 341 votes it has, it needs at least a few thousand to get the recognition it deserves, and maybe a bit more than 8.2.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best Disney animated films ever made.,"This movie is an absolute blast from start to finish. It introduces us to great characters that you seriously care about throughout the plot of the film. It also has tons of fun and funny moments throughout that really make it a joy ride all the way through tollbooth the credits. But what's great about lilo and stitch isn't just the fun behind it, but the emotion. Yeah, it's a cartoon aimed at children, but the characters have so much they are dealing with that at the end when the film finally reaches its happy ending, you feel the pure happiness that many films created nowadays is lacking.Just for the record, I am an almost 19 year old guy and never watched this movie as a kid until just now, so I have no connection or nostalgia to it whatsoever. I cried at the end because of how happy I was, and I have only cried in 2 other movies besides this one. Definitely recommend it. Stitch is now my favorite Disney character ever. It's a perfect family movie!!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
I loved this movie,"After the Disney Renissance ended in 1999, Disney began making movies that fell into a few certain categories. Good not great, great but didn't make much money, or just bad. This trend continued up to Bolt, but one of the major exeptions was Lilo and Stitch.A story of a girl named Lilo, who adobts an alien named Stitch who she thinks is a dog. But Stitch is being hunted by his creator Jumba, and AGent Plekley. Lilo also is having trouble at home, her parents died and now a social worker is threatening to take Lilo away from her older sister Nani if she can't find a job.The film works well not only as a science fiction adventure story, but as a heartwarming family drama. And unlike the emperors New Groove, it actually made money, and unlike chicken Little it didn't suck. Lilo and Stitch is a great film, and Disney's last great film until Bolt.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best Disney feature in years...see it!,"After watching Atlantis: The Lost Empire, I thought that Disney was caput on the traditional animation front. The entire thing felt like a huge waste of time, all because Disney didn't go that extra mile and make it completely different from its past features. It still had dumb, 'wacky' characters that were more annoying than funny, and any hopes of a mature story were overshadowed by their jokes. Thankfully, Lilo & Stitch rejuvenated my wearied soul. The writing is insanely inventive and funny, but the movie also made me choke back the tears with its endearing characters, especially the Lilo-Nani pair. You could really feel that they were sisters in a bad situation. I also love the Stitch character, just because the animation brings so much life to him even though he doesn't speak English for much of the film. Jumba and his skinny sidekick (can't remember that guy's name, but he was voiced by one of the Kids in Hall actors) were also quite funny, Jumba being more so because I loved his accent and roly-poly animation. You also have to give credit to Disney for not putting any real bad guys in this thing. In past Mouse movies, there is the BAD GUY and the GOOD GUY. If you were the BAD GUY, then you are pure, Satanic evil. If you were the GOOD GUY, you have no character flaws and are basically Jesus. Here, the 'bad' characters do good things, and the 'good' characters make mistakes. You know, like in real life. Duh! Of all the characters Lilo is probably my favorite, since she's so out there and weird. I think all kids can relate to her being stranded by the other girls, since every kid is weird in his/her own way. So, to say the least, Lilo is the best film of the summer for adults AND kids. Yes, its so touching and funny that both groups should love it. I give this teddy bear of a film 4 out of 4 stars.",,Anonymous,Animation
Not so good for kids,"Start of the movie really concerned me... Shows one child punching another *in the face* in the first few minutes.

As someone who grew up on Disney films like the Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin, I found this movie to be more for the new generation of kids out there.  Perhaps catering to parents just as much as their own children, Lilo and Stitch has a little more sophisticated humor while at the same time maintaining the level of Disney innocence that the world is used to.  I think everyone who enjoys a heartfelt story with a lot of laughs along the way will find Lilo and Stitch to be right up their ally.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Disney's return to classics!,"As a genuine Disney lover, I enjoy most of Disney's animated features. Lilo & Stitch was different, it was the first animated feature I had actually been looking forward to excitedly since the Lion King in 1994.

The watercolor backgrounds are beautifully done and help bring the Hawaiian atmosphere to life. The characters are fun and enticing.

Ooooh...,"Sequels aside, you can tell that Disney put alot of effort into their movies. It shows, too, in movies like the Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Mulan... Lilo & Stitch is no exception.When I first saw a clip of the movie, I thought it was going to be Disney's worst. Disney did not put too much effort into that clip. Then came the teasers, then I knew the movie was going to be good. The teasers were the first that caught my eye. Then came the word of mouth. ""Did you see this movie yet?"" ""That movie's really good."" ""It's almost too good to be Disney."" Once I saw it, it was higher than my already high expectations.I was expecting another Emperor's New Groove (which I also enjoyed), but what I really saw were movies that Disney had given us before. Movies that actually have themes.This isn't too good to be Disney. This movie is what Disney is all about, and it's a movie that I'm sure Walt would be proud of. Sure, the alien thing might make it look like some kind of plotless story that makes sure the audience is laughing too much to notice, but it's not. This movie, as different as it looks, is much like the Disney movies we've grown up with. I rank it up there with the Lion King, Pocahontas, Aladdin, etc. because it deserves to be in those ranks.The animation isn't revolutionary like Final Fantasy, but the movie is really good.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Tart and tender offering from Disney,"Filled with surprising depth and charm, ""Lilo and Stitch"" is proof that Disney hasn't entirely lost their touch, and that cel animation is still a very viable medium.  The film lacks the grandeur of earlier efforts, and the music is almost purely from Elvis Presley (this is not, by any means, a bad thing), but there's something here that Disney's earlier efforts have been lacking: real heart, and honest characters.Lilo is a Hawaiian girl with a morbid streak and a lot of pent-up agression. She has good cause: her parents have recently died in a car crash, leaving her in the care of her elder sister Nani.  Nani tries her best but she's not quite ready for the adulthood thing, nor is Lilo willing to accept Nani as an authority figure: ""I like you better as a sister than as a mother,"" she confides at one point.  Precocious without being cloying, realisticly bratty without being unlikeable, Lilo effortlessly endears herself to the audience.Unfortunately, Lilo's classmates aren't too thrilled with her, so Nani takes her to find companionship in the form of a dog.  Instead, Lilo finds a strange blue koala-like creature whom she christens ""Stitch.""  Stitch is in truth an alien known as Experiement 626.  Created for destruction and regarded by the alien council as an abberation of nature, Stitch was condemned to exile but escaped and wound up in our part of the galaxy. Like the title character of last year's ""Shrek,"" Stitch is an unlikely protagonist: importuned by the leader of the galactic council to show some sign of goodness, he responds with language that, had it been translated into English, would probably have knocked the film's rating up a notch. It is his growth through the story that makes Stitch, and the film, so appealing.While Lilo and Stitch gradually transform each other, the latter is being pursued by his creator and a nervous ""Earth expert,"" while the latter is threatened with being taken from Nani to a foster home.  The Social Services director on the girls' case, a massive man oddly (yet somehow appropriately) named Cobra Bubbles, serves as an example of the depth of the characters. In many other films, Bubbles would have been a two-dimentional symbol of an uncaring beaurocracy--here, he displays strong flashes of sympathy and humor.  Truth be told, with the possible exception of a humongous, shark-like alien general, there are no real bad guys in ""Lilo and Stitch""--only real people fighting because of conflicting desires.The resolution of ""Lilo and Stitch"" is rather abrupt, sorting out the conflict with almost buisness-like efficiency.  But the journey is an entertaining and moving one, and the characters we share it with, while a little rough around the edges, make the ride a good one.",,Anonymous,Animation
Disney is going to Hell in a hand basket!,"Disney needs to shape up and put some movies out that are worth watching. I think the last decent film they made was ""Mulan"".

Disney Finally Grows Up,"It was with high hopes that I went to see the newest Disney offering, ""Lilo & Stitch.""  I was not disappointed.Disney's newest offering (like ""Atlantis"", a PG-rated movie) is a fantastic mix of superb visuals, an endearing story, and wonderful voice acting.  It also jettisons many standard Disney elements, for which I was most grateful.Stitch is an alien fugitive, a being created by a mad scientist to be a weapon that escaped its confinement.  He is discovered by Lilo, a disturbed young orphan in Hawaii who thinks Stitch is an ugly dog.  Lilo lives with her older sister Nani, and the hulking social services agent Cobra Bubbles has threatened to take Lilo away from her if she does not prove herself as a parent.  Stitch, of course, causes all sorts of havoc in the middle of this.The animation is fantastic, mainly thanks to the use of watercolor cels, a technique not used for almost 60 years prior (in Disney's ""Dumbo"").  The characters are drawn with a high degree of realism, especially Nani who has the facial features and build of a true woman of Hawaiian descent and not the nymph-like physique of the standard Disney female.  Even the voices are accented correctly, thanks to native Hawaiians Tia Carrere and Jason Scott Lee.Thankfully, this is not a musical.  Sure, there are songs in it...but they're all Elvis Presely songs and there are no singing animals or song breaks.  The movie is sweet but not syrupy, endearing but not cloying. Stitch is by far not the cute, sweet, Disney animal but, like Lilo, a lost soul slowly learning to adapt to society and suppress their anger at the world.I highly recommend this movie to anyone, especially if you're like me, and thought Disney would never regain the wonder and beauty they lost after ""Hunchback of Notre Dame.""",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Great Job, Guys!","Next to ""Emperor's New Groove"", ""Lilo & Stitch"" is one of the funniest Disney films to come from the animation studio.

Stitch is an adorable alien with one thing on his mind, to destroy. Once that mission is completed, he needs to find a purpose in his existence.I could go on with the plot, but go see the film.

A great time in the cinema!,"First of all I have to admit that I am a very big fan of Disney movies but true, they somehow have lost their magic in recent years - ""Emperor's New Groove"" was great but in a very unlike Disney way and it's probably the funniest movie by them. Now, ""Lilo & Stitch"" is somehow a mix between the radical humour of ""Groove"" and their classic family stories - and it worked great!We had a great time in the cinema watching ""Lilo & Stitch"" and Stitch is for sure one of my favorite Disney characters ever! He's violent yet funny, he's angry but at the same time cute and lovable. Lilo is in some way in the same situation and they both look for a family. The science fiction sequences aren't very prominent in the movie and I think this is a good decision.Technically the film is - as all other Disney movies - top notch. It's not revolutionary, in fact they didn't try to have any technical breaktroughs with this film and invested more time into the characterizations. Again, great choice! The watercolour backgrounds give a very unique and refreshing look!Overall this is an almost perfect movie which can be seen by kids and adults alike. Kids won't be scared by the aliens and adults will get off on the great humour - watch for some cool movie refrences!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Average, could've been better","Lilo and Stitch was certainly a turnaround for Disney. Their films in the past ten years have done little to inspire, and have been more of a cameo hit for major actors and singers while forgetting the more critical points of plot and character.This film I felt turned it around some, but, like a person waking from a long sleep, the efforts were groggy and uncertain in places. The introductory sequence was too heavy on exposition and slowed the flow of the start of the movie too much. They could've delivered the same information in one short scene, rather than drag it out.Lilo and Nana shouldn't have been portrayed as a broken family. Their quarreling and consummate misbehavior prevented me (and likely the rest of the audience) from sympathizing and bonding with them. I think also Nana's regular outfit was inappropriate for young kids to see, showing too much midriff. It took too long into the movie for them to develop, and the same was true with Stitch.Stitch is one of the most interesting characters to come along in ages, but he was vastly underused. Why did they wait through two-thirds of the movie before allowing him to speak? That barrier of silence again prevented sympathy and bonding, and it wasn't until his talk with Nana near the end before I felt I had a grasp of the character.The Elvis sequences were cute, but I think in the end they kept Stitch from developing until late in the movie. He should've been given some time alonein the spotlight to develop more quickly. In short, I think the concept of the movie was good but the timing and use of characters needed more planning and better timing. Overall, it was okay, but it's not one I'd likely go see again--the end credit sequence was great, though.",,Anonymous,Animation

Imaginative,"This is one of Disney's best films. It has the 2000s-era experimentation with science fiction themes combined with the classic heartwarming stories. The characters are more interesting in this case - a young child and her older sister who has to take care of her. It's quite imaginative and exciting all the way through, especially the character Stitch who is like a very violent equivalent of E.T.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A TRUE DISNEY CLASSIC,"The first time I saw this movie, almost 20 years ago, I really liked it.But now I realized how great it actually is.Right now, I am rewatching all the Disney animated movies, and this one is one of the best. The structure of the stiory, act 1, act 2 and act 3 are so well done.In most Disney animated movies act 3 is very weak, and feels rushed. This movie takes time with the its characters and THE ENDING.And the character development of the character Stitch, is one of the best developments in any Disney animated movie.The movie is funny, the action feels great and the characters are interesting.Lilo is adorable, and you will love her with all your heart.In the end, this is a truly fantastic movie, and one of Disney's best animated movies of all time.

Disney is back,"After deciding to not see this movie in theaters due to several years of Disney summer release disappointments, I now feel bad that I did make the decision to rent the DVD when it came out because it truly is more in line with the quality animated films Disney used to make.  Granted, a movie about a six limbed alien with bad manners did seem to be a pretty odd subject matter, I can honestly say that Disney hit a home run and left me ""all shook up""  Okay okay so I used an Elvis pun, but in reality this film used many elvis songs in its soundtrack which was very well utilized.Setting the film in Hawaii with the beautiful scenery and almost magical atmosphere left me with a feeling that I was really in our 50th state.  The opening sequence containing a very artistically done rendition of a Hawaiian hula dance left me spellbound and wanting to see more of this unusual animation style.  My children (9-5) both enjoyed this film equally as much as I did and since we bought the DVD we have watched it many times.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Color Me Unimpressed,"Watching Lilo & Stitch hundreds of years after it came out like I am, I wasn't terribly impressed. Lilo (Daveigh Chase) is a girl who is an outcast and finds numerous ways to be different and generally mess things up for her sister and caretaker Nani (Tia Carrere). Stitch (Chris Sanders) is an alien that is ultra-destructive, but he is Lilo's pet and ""family.""What does that mean for the plot? Lilo, and primarily Stitch, would cause destruction for three-fourths of the movie and then turn it around in the last quarter for the win.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
I laughed more during this movie than during MIB2...,"Lilo & Stitch is a welcome breath of fresh air for anyone, like myself, that has fallen out of touch with Disney animated movies.  (I mean, if asked to name the most recent Disney movies, I would answer, ""Um, well there was Lion King...then Mulan was in there somewhere...oh and that Hercules one...I think..."")Even though the story deals with an alien convict crash-landing on Kauai, this movie is so much more *real* then any other Disney movie I can think of.  The issue of a family being broken up by the death of the parents is real.  The eccentric and understandably child-like actions and feelings of Lilo as she tries to fit in are real.  Even the style of the characters is more real, since it seems that Disney animators have finally discovered that women don't all have waists the diameter of a soda can.Sure, people say that the plot makes itself too neat sometimes, but I think that adds to the humor.  I thought the ending was all that much funnier for all the loose ends being tied up in wierd ways.  The art, too, was mesmorizing.  I adored the watercolor renditions of Hawaiian landscapes. The songs, both Elvis and hawaiian-style background music, are very nice as well, and I for one don't miss the long and drawn-out musical sequences that have been Disney's claim to fame.Anyway, bottom line, if four cynical and jaded teenagers can have more fun at this movie than at MIB2, then *anyone* can, and I recommend it to everyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Some of Disney's Best Work Along With GMD,"One fact is certain, Disney has Mickey's fingers on the pulse of society. Occasionally after a few child adoring epics such as The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and the Lion King, Disney will create a hilariously quirky feature or featured character for those of us who love to laugh. Timone & Pumba ignite the screen during the somber moments in LK, Robin Williams' Genie steals the light from Aladdin's lamp and then comes Stitch.Disney trudged through the mud in the late 1970's and early 1980's until the masterful and completely underrated Great Mouse Detective.  The grand comedic timing and talented cast allowed the Mouse to expand his horizons. Lilo & Stitch is the benefactor of that expansion.Stitch is known as ""Experiment 626"" on his home planet and is sent into exile.  Through some bungling, he arrives on Earth where he disguises his crude body to look somewhat like a canine.  The lonely and obtuse orphaned girl Lilo adopts him and true mayhem ensues.The relationships are portrayed beautifully from the big sister/little sister angle to the transformation of Stitch from monster to family member. The jokes are hysterical albeit mature, the character development is superb and the animation breathtaking.This isn't Bambi.  If you want Dumbo, rent it.  If you want Disney meets a G-Rated Monty Python/Original Saturday Night Live Cast, this is your movie. For more enjoyment, the Great Mouse Detective is highly recommended as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
GENIUS!,"This cartoon film in a word is Genius! Disney has finally stepped away from fantasy and cute fuzzy characters and made a cartoon about real people, real situations, and real reactions. The only farfetched aspectare the aliens.You have Lilo and Nani sisters trying to make it on their own after the loss of their Parents, This I have seen personally in my life and felt the emotional attachment to them. I felt bad when Nani was losing jobs and when Lilo was was being tormented by fellow students and acting out to gain attention, and having to deal with Social Workers whose main existence is to break up families. Even stitch Pleaded that ""My family is a bit broken, but still good""The scenes when Lilo and Stitch are searching for families are more emotional than any other disney feature I have ever seen. I do not understand why Critics like Ebert and Roper gave this film a bad write up, they must not watch Real Life tv shows very often.Now there is the lovable and evil character of Stich, who was made to be the ultimate weapon but learns what the meaning of family is and is taught to create and not destroy. His voice and his antics make him adored by moviegoers from the beginning, and when he suffers so do the fans. I don't believe I have ever seen a more emotional attachment to a movie characterall in all I give this Film a Ten... above episode 2 above spider man... see this movie this summer!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good but could be better!,Aloha!!! Another movie from Disney! The movie itself was much better than I thought BUT it wasnt best movie i saw from Disney. The start was pretty boring in my opinion and small children wouldnt care much about how was Experiment 626 was made and etc.There wasnt a real reaction in the first scene from children and grown-ups. But when 626 did alive to earth and was becoming shooting at the rain drops than suddenly movie was getting to a funny point. Afterwards the funny thinks were coming after each other for example: when the dogs were afraid of Stitch or when David burnt himself. The most important thing was that it also had education behind it. Everyone should have a family. I like the scene when Stitch realizes that by looking at lonely duck. The action scene was also great at the end of movie. Let the evil lose again!Overall the movie was great but Disney had much better movie!Rating: 8.5/10,,Anonymous,Animation
My problem with this film began with the trailers,"I was very much offended by the LILO AND STITCH trailers featuring the characters from BEAUTY AND THE BEAST,which is my favorite film. The trailer is canonically illogical and shows a complete lack of respect on the part of the filmmakers. All the trailers with characters that came before LILO AND STITCH were meaningless-they turned Jasmine into a slut,but it didn't work because the rest of the magic carpet rideHAPPENED in ALADDIN. If that was the way the movie went,it would make sense,but the cold hard fact is that it didn't. The BATB chandelier stayed right where it was in the REAL movie. These are the facts of the fiction. Trying to alter them is dishonest-in fact,it's cinematic rape. You cannot destroy classic cinema like BEAUTY AND THE BEAST-it is immortal. They danced. I know what I saw. I think I'm forgetting something. Oh,the movie. What about it? I'd rather jump out of a plane without a parachute than see LILO AND STITCH.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"This was a Disney movie?  No, seriously, this was a Disney film?","It IS a Disney film, and it shows Disney Magic at its best.  I have to tip my hat to Chris Sanders (the Director) for making an original, and refreshing animated film.  I love the characters and plot so much, but I'll let you watch it and find out how good it is for yourselves, however, I do want to mention some things I noticed and enjoyed in the film.   First off, it's humor; it's slapstick comedy, and it's timing is right on!  Underated Disney films like The Great Mouse Detective, and Rescuers Down Under pull off this subtle timing of humor, but never so masterfully as Lilo & Stitch. Also the colors in this movie are spectacular.  In fact the cold technology of the Aliens in the first scenes of the film were so well contrasted by the warmth of planet Earth in all her watercolor pastel beauty later on.  The anatomy of the human characters is the best I've seen in any animated movie ever made!  Sure they are stylized in Chris Sanders art style, just like our Japanese neighbors and Hayo Miyazaki's style being rendered in all of his films; but the anatomy is amazing in Lilo & Stitch.  Nani (Lilo's older sister) moves and looks like a real woman!  She has a smaller chest, and very wide hips.  She looks so natural, that you almost start to believe she is real.  The story itself has emotion, action, adventure, comedy, love, friendship, and a frog  sitting by the side of the road!  What more could you ask for in a film?!  Elvis music?  Has it.  Watch it!  You won't regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Disney film since Dumbo!,"I took my 6 year old nephew to see this film.  Both of us loved it.  My favorite Disney film is Dumbo but Stitch is a close second.   This film strayed from the formula that has made most of Disney's recent films boring.The characters of Stitch and Lilo are both adorable but not bland and goody goody.  However, I was not impressed with the other alien characters and David.  I think the beginning of the movie could of also used some work.  The quality of the film drastically improved once Stitch was in Hawaii. Still, ""Lilo & Stitch"" is the best animated feature in a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Thank the good lord Disney hit the Jackpot!!,"This is by far one of the best Animated Disney films to date.  Asaid from the typical Disney ""family is where the home is"", this is very entertaining. In every Disney film there is always a character which is trying to be a cute little ball of fluff, and this is no exception.  Except fo the fact that the cute creature is a weapon of mass destruction with a blue car and a chain saw.  The plot is slow to get going but once it pick up you'll be fully engrosed in it.  Jokes in the movie are fresh and won't date with time.  Suffice to say, ""oh good, my dog found the chainsaw"" is one of the memerable parts of the film.  Strangly origonal with a hint of Disney magic that makes this film a must see for people of all ages, if you do not agree take what sense of humour you have and trade it in for Lilo and Stich.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Disney animated feature in years,"I have never seen people's opinions so polarized on a animated feature as I have with Lilo & Stitch. As one who found this feature hilarious, touching, smart, bold (for Disney), true-to-form, gorgeous, and a joy to watch, I can't begin to understand how anyone could be in the opposing camp. And as a native Hawaiian myself, I find it interesting that the only people who found it culturally offensive--some whom I know personally--are non-Hawaiians. Why, a reader asks, is everyone drawn with fat legs? Because some (not all) Hawaiians have thick legs (especially calves). It's refreshing to see these artists and animators unafraid to portray (again, some) local people as they really look. Why does Lilo immediately pounce upon a girl and start beating her up? Because sometimes haoles (an absolutely non-derogatory term for caucasians) are outspoken and don't think about the consequences of their words. Funny how Lilo's character is berated for her actions yet no one says a word about the girl who blurts ""you're crazy!""My advice: Don't let the negative comments expressed by some viewers deter you from watching this refreshingly different and well-crafted animated feature. If the breathtaking watercolor backdrops don't get you, the humor and music will. See it and be your own judge.",,Anonymous,Animation

Fabulous,"I though Disney was kind of in a rut with its recent features.  In fact, I'm not even sure whether I've seen the last couple.  But this one was completely new, and wonderful.  The animation was compelling, but much more interesting to me was the story, which was about the anger, and the resultant acting out, of two children deprived of their parents.  Of course, there are aliens and a monster that gets tamed, battles and lots of jokes, but the subtext was about coming to grips with loss and grief.  What a change for animation where you expect a little adventure, maybe a little boy meets girl.  Great story, wonderfully well told.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Stitch is a winner,"I think that Disney has come up with a winning new character  in Stitch. The story line is not as good as it might be , but it starts off with a bang and keeps moving.

"Bittersweet ride, but the lesson is unconditional love.","This movie is emotionally like a Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride.  I took my 3 year old grand daughter, as well as both my daughters (late 20's), and the 4 of us laughed, cried, laughed, and cried again.  We have been back 3 times already.  My little grand daughter didn't really understand what made her sad, but this was an excellent spring-board to discuss with her empathy and compassion.  She will tell you in a heart beat that o'hana is family, and that means no one gets left behind, and no one is forgotten.  What an extraordinary way to teach young toddlers the strong bond of family, and the importance of each and every living thing!  This baby had a healthy sense of self-value already, as well as an attachment to Momma and Grandma, but now she knows anything or anyone can be part of family if you want it to be. Because Stitch related to the story of the ""Ugly Duckling"", we were able to read the story, and discuss the things about the ugly duckling that were similar to Stitch, and how outside appearances don't have anything to do with what's inside, and that love is blind.  Besides lessons of empathy and compassion, we were able to discuss acceptance and unconditional love.We've always loved the princess stories and been able to relate to being sweet and nice no matter what, but in those stories, everyone is beautiful and rich and the poor beautiful princess is rescued by a handsome knight in shining armor.  In this story, a lonely, sad, angry child who still loves in spite of rejection is able to spread love by just loving.  And an unusual creature built solely for destruction learns the value of love and family. The bottom line is that children can learn that every being is valuable and worthy of love.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
this is dumbo/bambi quality,"This movie could just have been made 60 years ago. It feels the same as Dumbo or Bambi.

The Hawaiian music is a winner too.When I first read about Disney making a movie about an alien crashing down on earth and taken up in a human family I thought the bosses had lost their mind. No one will ever buy that from the company. I'm glad that I was wrong. A Disney Classic, but with a unexpected approach.Personally I never felt there was anything wrong with the modern, 90's classics where the hero and heroine fall in love defeating the badguy helped by talking parrots, fish, theapots or clocks.

Wicked and mischievous; I smell a Disney Channel series,"Though Stitch is a genetically engineered alien life form, he fits the archetype of the mischievous sprite, and though his type is common in story and film, Stitch is an gloriously inspired creation for the X-Files age. He breaks out of confinement at home and escapes to Earth, landing in (where else?) Hawaii, where he winds up in the pound and to survive, morphs himself into a (rather grotesque-looking) dog. He is adopted by Lilo, who is about eight and who is being raised (barely) by her older sister Nani (Tia Carrere) since the death of their parents in a car wreck. In her grief, Lilo has become the quintessence of brattiness. The unlikeliest of social workers, Cobra Bubbles (Ving Rhames), is keeping his eye on the whole chaotic situation, while Stitch is on the run from his creator, Dr. Jumba, and Pleakley, an expert on Earth life. The parallel stories of Stitch's gradually realizing the achievement of ""ohana"" (""family"" in Hawaiian) and his attempts to elude capture by steadily growing forces arrayed against him begin hilariously to collide, until they finally come together at the end. This is obviously material for a series on the Disney Channel, although if the creators really want to keep it wicked, it may have to go on HBO or Showtime. A character note: Younger viewers (i.e., those under 50) probably won't realize that David Ogden Stiers's excellent Russian accent as Jumba is actually a bull's-eye impression of the late Akim Tamiroff.",,Anonymous,Animation

"Original, but too many flaws","A good box office hit doesn't always means that it's a great movie and inverse. ""Lilo & Stitch"" proofs that, although it became a bigger box office hit than ""The Emperor's New Groove"", ""Atlantis"" and ""Treasure Planet"", three much better movies.And it's a shame, because ""Lilo"" has a lot of potential (SPOILERS); the presentation of Elvis Presley, many movie parodies, a bad alien with a koala looks who is not capable to feel emotions (notice that some aliens looks like animals), a little girl struggling with her messed up family situation, etc. The last mentioned thing is something that you rarely see in a Disney feature, who makes ""Lilo"" have a soap opera feeling too it. SPOILERS OVER""Lilo & Stitch"" it's not a bad movie, but not a great one either. The biggest problem is the weak script and a totally messed up story; It miss a structure. (SPOILER) This film is called ""Lilo & Stitch"" and it should be about both of them, but because of the weak script, this story becomes much more about Stitch than Lilo. And that's a shame, cause it's easier to connect with her than with him.And those two don't really connect emotionally in this picture. And that's a shame. Except Cobra Bubbles, Nani and Lilo, the rest of the characters are quite annoying. SPOILERS OVER.Many reviewers has pointed out that this movie is not sentimental. That is WRONG! This is one of Disney's most sentimental movies ever! End of discussion. The movie is sometimes funny, but I've seen movies much more funnier.The action sequences are just chaotic and not exiting at all. The score of Alan Silvestri is neither working well.OK, enough complaining. Like you see, I'm not yelling ""hurray"" for this picture, cause it has two many flaws for me to really like it. But Chris Sanders and Dean Deblois shall have praise for coming up with original idea for a Disney feature.The Hawaiian songs are catchy and the first 20 minutes are much better than the rest of the film. The animation is beautiful and it's good that Disney are using water colors again. If the script were a little more tighten up, this could be a better film (in my opinion).",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A brilliant buildup to a self-destructive conclusion,"I absolutely loved the first half of this movie:  Stitch was perfectly characterized as reckless and feral and completely dangerous in the compass of his small, adorable form.  Lilo, when first introduced, ran the risk of being nauseatingly cute, but it dissipated as her quirks rose to the surface.  Even the sister was remarkably deep; in fact, one of the most outstanding qualities of this latest Disney installment is that the plot followed the development of three characters simultaneously and with an equally talented brush.  I found myself interested in the outcome of all three characters, unlike so many other Disney films which follow one protagonist surrounded by a static collection of stereotypes.But I knew the heights to which Disney brought the plot would fall as its innovation by necessity had to be hammered into a hackneyed moral lesson and a conclusion in which all loose ends must be tied up in the most just and comforting fashion possible.  But the methods they used--!  I was able to suspend my disbelief for half of the show, but the chain of events grew more and more logically outlandish until in the end I was forced to throw my hands in the air and feel as if I were almost watching a different movie where all internal integrity had been lost!I enjoyed this movie greatly, and it's one of Disney's best.  I knew the ending had to be shoehorned in, and as a result, I sat back and enjoyed it. But it was a flaw that derails it from its course to being a true classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A treasure-worthy gem!,"""Lilo & Stitch"" is a gem, a jewel, a delight, and a must-see for all children and children-at-heart.  It entertains without ""dumbing down"" and there are many levels of humor to enjoy.  This little movie touched my heart, and my kids (4 1/2 & 6 1/2) totally loved it.  Anyone who has ever felt like they're on the outside looking in (and haven't we all at some point?) will identify with Lilo and her efforts to make and keep friends. Ah, but children can be so cruel, especially to anyone they perceive as ""different.""  My heart broke for the sad little girl who couldn't fit in, yet cheered her determination to remain true to herself.  The movie never lapses into slobbering sentimentality; these are characters worth caring about, who insist on persevering together in spite of the many setbacks that keep popping up.  The philosophical issues that are dealt with are done in a manner that everyone would do well to imitate.  (Cobra Bubbles deserves special mention here as the social worker/former CIA agent with a big heart...)The visuals in this movie are stunning, as has been mentioned already. There are enough twists to keep you on the edge of your seat, and the ending is heart-warming, not sappy.  This little jewel has found a place in my heart right next to ""Casablanca""; a movie to be watched over and over and appreciated anew each time.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Hilarious, Moving, A True Classic","I had a chance to see a preview of ""Lilo and Stitch"" and I want to recommend it as a must-see movie for this summer.  The opening of the movie has some great comic-action moments, somewhat inspired by ""Star Wars"" as genetic experiment '626' (Stitch) escapes the clutches of the Galactic Federation.The movie really shines when he crash lands on Hawaii and becomes the ""puppy"" of Lilo, a young Hawaiian girl who lives with her sister.  Lilo sees the world in a creative, amusing, and truly different way, and that makes it hard for her to make friends.  She's a great character, and her relationship with her guardian/sister is truly realistic and also fun.This movie has the combination that makes Disney movies great -- comedy and heart.  You'll laugh as Stitch, designed to destroy, tries to find a way to cope with the fact that there is nothing around him on this beautiful Hawaiian island to destroy.  You'll sniffle as he tries to find his greater purpose, and you'll cheer as he uses his awesome powers to help Lilo and make things right.The animators did a truly wonderful job of making a beautiful movie.  From the water color backgrounds which capture the Hawaiian locale perfectly, to the digital spaceships and vehicles, to the animation of the graceful hula, to the hyper-kinetic Stitch.  This is a beautiful movie and a joy to watch.Stitch is my favorite animated character of all time.  He can be a crazy, caffeinated monster to a truly touching and lost creature.  I dare you not to sniffle at least once during this movie.  The story works on so many levels, and is a true Disney classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best in years,"The Disney Studios have finally gotten back to their artistic roots. This movie is a stunning blend of the best of the studio, Technology and art drama and comedy and a great story telling, merged together for an all out good time at the picture show.I would say that this is without a doubt the best Disney Movie since Beauty and the Beast. I highly recommend it to everyone, although I would say maybe little ones under the age of 6 should wait as there are some sad, and some loud moments which might upset the littler ones.The watercolour Backgrounds rock! And Lilo is very easy to identify with, and has some real human problems, that are dealt with in fantastic ways.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

This is Disney at it's best. Honestly,"""Lilo & Stitch"" tells the touching story of a lonely little Hawaiian girl, named Lilo, who meets and befriends Stitch, an escaped refugee alien who poses as a dog at the pound.I wasn't expecting much when it first came out, not being to interested in it. Well, after seeing it at the theater, I can now say it is Disney's best film. Ever. It's better than classics like ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Little Mermaid,"" both of which I adore. Many will not feel the same way as I do but I thought ""Lilo & Stitch"" was one of Disney's most inventive and involving scripts with fleshed-out and well-written characters.We are set in Hawaii, a tropical background that gives the movie a great feel. Setting it in Kansas, as originally planned, would not have had the same effect. The animation is simply beautiful, with pink fluffy clouds and wonderfully drawn characters.However, it's the story that ""Lilo & Stitch"" tells, along with many other great elements, that makes this film so outstanding. Not only is the film very funny (in fact, it's hilarious!) with pure moments of comic genius that can appeal to older audiences as well as kids, it's one of the most touching films I have ever seen. The whole middle of the movie is one that gives us spectacular scenes in a row that move me to tears each time.***SKIP THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH, TO AVOID MILD SPOILERS***I don't wanna say too much, but Nani's fight for custody of Lilo, tossed in with Stitch's touching character arc and search for the one place he does belong, and Lilo's loneliness, and a broken family, and cherished and beloved friendship with Stitch make this movie a surprisingly heartwarming and touching feature. One of the film's strengths is that it can be, at times, so sad.***END SPOILERS***The direction is solid, as is the animation. The water, and backdrop of Hawaii is desirable. The characters are developed, unlike most Disney classics, and lovable. You can identify with these characters and feel for them, and yes, Stitch does qualify in that category. His battered emotions, as well as the also adorable Lilo, are part of what makes this film so moving. This is an original, funny, and extremely heartwarming film that I highly recommend to families.""Lilo & Stitch"" was wonderful characters that I instantly fell in love with. More captivating than previous, sub-par Disney releases such as ""Hercules,"" ""Hunchback of Notre Dame,"" or ""Tarzan,"" this movie makes me laugh, cry, and moves me immensely. While it didn't break any new ground or anything, it thankfully returned audiences back to Disney's roots in terms of quality.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

At Last: A Full-Dimension Disney Character,"This is the best Disney product since Pinocchio--thanks largely to the depth of the main human character, Lilo.  The Disney studios have a particular affection for the one-dimensional character--and this film is no exception. In this case, as opposed to the disappointing Atlantis epic, the technique works as it should--because most of the characters are from the same ethnical background.  Lilo, however, is the aspect of this film elevating it above the other modern Disney animations. She can't be described by one word or even by the 1000 words allowed for this review.  Stitch, her mutant space-pet, is pure Disney and pure fun, following the edgey smoke trails and paw tracks of Aladdin's Genie or Mulan's Dragon.  I heartily recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen it solely because he or she has given up on Disney. I give it a rating of 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

This movie is absolutely the best animated film I've seen in a long time,"I absolutely loved Lilo and Stitch. Stitch is incredibly adorable, and so is Lilo. Though it may seem somewhat dull, and I'll admit it, stupid, it's actually quite funny and it's cute, let alone it doesn't have so much material for it to be a kiddie movie to make parents want to cry if they're forced to see this movie. I think it has something for everyone.It actually deals with a realistic topic, such as a broken home, and such. I wont say what happens in the movie, because I'd rather have people see it than simply read a summary of it and feel as if they've seen it already. I loved this movie, it's cute and funny, and I think it's best to simply let the reader of this comment make their own opinion about the movie if they do go see it...and please do, it's not excrutiatingly painful to watch, and who knows, if you're not into Disney movies, maybe this one will make you change your mind.

There is something about Stitch...........,"I can't explain it, and I think I don't even have the words for it to describe how I feel after watching this new Disney movie. I am a great Disney fan, and a movie like SHREK could only amuse me once as where with Disney movies I see them as often as I can. Stitch is something that first makes you feel like you want to leave the theater. Not because Stitch is awful not because you don't like the caracter,it is just a feeling like 'this is not Disney'. But after a while you find yourself leaning back in your seat, enjoying the fun we also know from the Disney/Pixar movies, and although I'd rather heard some new songs instead of some old Elvis songs, it's okay after a while. When I went to the cinema again to watch another movie, I found myself in doubt, did I want to see a new movie? Stitch however was able to draw me back to watch the movie for a second time. It's still an unusual Disney movie, but I like the fact that they are so daring and not afraid of competition from other companies out there. Disney proves, not only their movies, even the company will always remain a 'classic', hard to remove from the world stage! thumbs up!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wow...,"By the time of this film's release, almost every moviegoer had probably seen at least one of the extremely clever trailers Disney placed for this film. Featuring character of Stitch disrupting memorable scenes from several Disney classics (from ""The Little Mermaid"" to ""Aladdin""), the ads essentially promised that ""Lilo & Stitch"" would abandon the tradition of the past few years' formulaic Disney efforts, for something completely new and original.  So does the film deliver?Yes.  Absolutely, yes.  This film easily reaches at least the same caliber as any of Pixar's efforts, if not a superior level altogether. The characters and voice acting are incredible, the story is less predictable than in any animated feature I've seen, and it is utterly hilarious.  Even the ""manipulative"" scenes, where the film is clearly tugging for the viewer's heartstrings, actually WORK, and somehow avoid drowning the film in sappiness.Go see it.

Definitely one of Disney's best!! :),"I know there were many who couldn't seem to get into Lilo and Stitch because is wasn't the typical animated fairy tale for which Disney has been famous for so long.

There is plenty of humor to go around for the kids as well as the adults.  I think what people need to remember is that there are only so many fairy tales for Disney to pick from before they run out.  I think everyone involved in putting together a full-length, animated Disney feature is passionate and talented enough to move into the 21st century while keeping a firm grasp on the old-fashioned Disney flare.  This movie was pure proof of that!  Don't get me wrong. The fairy tales that Disney has already chosen like Cinderella and Beauty and the Beast are cherished classics and always will be.

Because they lost their parents. so, Nani decides to have a dog for Lilo. Lilo selects the dog in pet shop. The dog that Lilo selected is Stitch!!! Since then Lilo and Stitch live together. But Stitch doesn't know ""Ohana"" at all. It means ""family"" in Hawaii. so, Stitch is self-centered, and behave at the discretion of himself. At first, they aren't getting along with each other. While they live together, little by little, Stitch learn significance of Ohana, his whereabouts from Lilo.Many events strengthen relationship between Lilo and Stitch. They become precious friends!!!!! This is hart-warming story. so, I burst out crying.This is touching movie. After watching this movie, you will have a refreshing feeling. This is dubbed version, you can enjoy sound of their cute voice. The scene of this story is Hawaii. So, the heart that Hawaii cherish others is painted much in this movie. I think it is very good!

Define Ohana...,"Lilo and Stitch is the perfect definition of Ohana (family).  Family is Blood, Bone (ancestors), and those who are family in spirit, such as Stitch.

Even though there are some Hawaiin words that are not explained (Kapu written on Lilo's door means Forbidden), you don't get the feeling that you are really missing anything.

It is certainly one of Disney Animation's riskier films and I believe it proves people like different. The main protagonist is a dog like alien creature, Stitch is not a flawless character, nor can he even speak English, and yet he is lovable all the way through.I did feel that there could have been a bit more sentimental moments, there are not many running gags or aspects of characters that we are taken back to later on, things like that bring us closer to the characters and help us form a connection with them more.It is relaxing and fun to watch, the Hawaiian theme, the Elvis music, the whimsical characters and the heartwarming relationship that develops between the title characters are just several aspects that make this film worth your while.

"Indeed, Disney has leaped from its deathbed in a fresh burst of life","I've always been a fan of animated Disney families.  But even my stubborn attachment has not blinded me from the harsh fact that the films have been going downhill for sometime now with only a very few pleasant surprises.When I first saw trailors for this movies, I wanted to see, despite the nagging voice in my head that said it might not be that great.  When it came out, I was met with plenty of great reviews.  Unfortunately, my little college town is not known for a plethera of movie theatres, so summer passed and so did this film from theatre to video/DVD.  When a friend purchased the DVD, only then did I get to see it.What a gem! This twisted and poignant little tale is truly worthy of the name of Disney.The story itself is surprisingly clever and original.  That imagination alone is enough to love this movie.  Then the makers go throw in a bunch of delightfully varying and quirky characters, plenty of humor, and more charm and heart than should be legal.  You are able to understand the characters, know them, and, most of all, love them.This isn't just quality entertainment.  There are several great messages on the importance of family, no matter the kind, and redemption. That's something Disney rarely shows: Most of its heros are heroic at the beginning.  Yeah, the learn something and grow a little bit, but not to the extent of Stitch, Lilo, and Nani.  Stitch begins the movie as an evil and chaotic little alien.  Lilo is a twisted little child who could have grown up to be the next Carrie.  Nani is hardly the typical Disney female with her temper, frustration, and disorganization.  But even as the characters learn and grow, you love them for exactly who they are.The animation is to be appreciated.  It's a tribute to classic Disney hand-drawn animation, with just a touch of computer to give it that nice edge and finish.  Add plenty of Hawian color, and you got a film that is just great to stare at.I don't know where Disney's been hiding for so long, but I'm glad it decided to crawl out and start actually working under its reputation.This movie is with Disney's finest.(I'm also happy to say that this film was not a one-time thing.

"Has all the elements, but is lacking something.","I just got back from seeing this film and am once again disappointed in a Disney film.  I just can't figure this one out.  This is a cute story, has great characters, lots of action and takes care of some things that have been lacking in a LOT of Disney films-but I still left the theater without really caring about the characters.I'm not going to reiterate the plot line.  I'm sure you've heard it enough. Lilo is a very spunky little girl who is VERY lifelike in her attitudes and actions, still coping with her parents death. There are times in the film when you just want to pick her up and hold her, but there are other times where you just question why a girl as smart as she is is not more aware of her situation.  All I've seen on her says she's 11, but my take is closer to 5-7.Every time I saw Nonni on the screen, I really wanted to cheer!  Finally an animated film with a realistic female body!  Her hips are actually wider than her bust and she is proportional!!!  Hallelujah, they are finally listening.  (I think Odette's waist in the Swan Princess was something like 1/6 her bust).  And I loved not only her interaction with her sister in similarities, but their fights as well.Ving Rhames couldn't have been better as Cobra Bubbles.  There are just some voices that are meant to be certain characters and this is his.  (Think of the difference between John Goodman in The Emperor's New Groove as the peasant and Monster's as Sully).The supporting characters of Jumbaa, Grand Counsel woman and Plinkley are good but they left me flat.Stitch does an amazing transformation in his search for someplace to belong, and I cheered when he said he could be soft and fluffy, but again-I really didn't truly CARE.There is no real quintisential Disney villian in this piece and I think that is truly lacking, but with the villians they've had lately, that may be an improvement.I read a review that panned this film as too long and just not enough something.  They felt it would be a great cartoon series.  While I liked it well enough to see it at least one more time, I pray for the cartoon series. Now THAT is a vehicle with potential for this story.On my Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh LD, there is a featurette in which they said that because America was unfamiliar with Winnie the Pooh in the early 60's, Walt decided to split the story into 3 pieces to give us time to get used to and fall in love with Edward Bear.  It worked then and it is a shame that they weren't able to do something similar here.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent picture...with Elvis tunes! 9/10,"Lilo and Stich is the most pleasing family film I have seen in sometime. The film is bound to be classic, it has a type of unique story and lovable characters that place it with such masterpieces as Robin Hood and Dumbo. This is a film old Walt would have loved.  Lilo and Stich isn't just a rehash of E.T. as many naive critics have said; the film takes a much different approach to a slightly similar story line.  This is the family film of the year, no doubt, and adults will love this film as much as children.

"I know I'm a minority on giving this film a 10, but I can't help loving it.","Lilo and Stitch was great film with extremely likable characters, great animation, strong emotion, and jokes that are hilarious. It really hasn't been appreciated as much as it should be. The film is filled with likable characters such as Stitch, and especially Lilo. Lilo is such a strange, but adorable kid that is one of the most likable characters in animation in the 2000's. The music is great. It features a few songs from Elvis, and it has some great Hawaiian songs. The jokes aren't just chucklers they are jokes that will genuinely make you laugh even if you are an adult. Then there is the strong emotion about family. Lilo and Stitch was a sign of a great decade for Disney animation, but instead of making great movies they decided to rip off little girls with Hannah Montana, The Jonas Brothers, and High School Musical. Lilo and Stitch is a film that is impossible not to love.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disney has returned to its roots!,"I felt this movie was absolutely what this summer needed. A wonderful story mixed with a unique view point on ""ohana"", which means family, completes one of the best Disney films I have seen in a while. If they continue with this kind of film their classic animation department may catch up with the new digital, Pixar, department. In short, it works for kids, teens, adults and anyone who wants to just escape reality for a while.Suggested snack for this film: Something fruity and lighter. It will compliment the light feeling given by the watercolor animation.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, but - but good","Finally Disney has seen the utility of appealing also to the huge audience of overgrown kids (re: 40ish, re: me) who like some nastiness amongst all the syrupy stuff. This is a pretty good movie, as cartoons go. Stitch is great, Lilo (finally) is a bad girl with no excuses save a raging temper (inherited along with her sister's). The side characters are good, if a flinch underdeveloped, even if the chief inspector looks a bit ""Men In Black"" (willingly, i hope). And most of all - NO BAD GUYS! Finally Disney grasped the idea that everyone is good and bad at times or - as they say - everyone has his moments. The humor is good and, i suspect, heavily inspired by Calvin & Hobbes - the ""San Francisco"" scene appears IDENTICAL in a strip and the temper and drawing tastes of Lilo are very much alike to Calvin's. The weak point is the hurriedness of plot in the very end - make it 10 minutes instead of 2 and it would still have been fresh, maybe with some flashback. Oh, and stay for the credits - worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"This movie is so good, it's...really good.","Disney isn't exactly known for the same quality as they used to be. The biggest problem is how they've lost their originality, churning out sequels and based-on-blahdeeblah movies. However, Lilo & Stitch is not only original, it has the same charm and appeal that some of the best classics had.This movie is a master at manipulating your emotions. When I watched it, I laughed when it wanted me to laugh, I sat on the edge of my seat(nearly falling off), and nearly started sobbing. This movie will make you feel whatever the heck it wants you to, but they're all enjoyable.One part of it, where Lilo tries to teach Stitch to be an Elvis imitator, had me smiling constantly the entire way through. My cheeks seriously hurt when it ended.Stitch is perhaps the most lovable little monster you'll ever see in a movie, and this Lilo & Stitch is perhaps one of the most lovable movies you'll ever see. One of Disney's finest, let us move aside Cinderella and Aladdin to make room for a new classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"One of the first truly original Disney animated films, ever!","I knew this film would be different from the instant the credits rolled, when they read ""based on an idea from Chris Sanders"".  Wow...an original IDEA, not a knock-off of some old fairy tale.This is a lovely film.  It's beautiful to look at:  The backgrounds are dazzling hand-painted watercolor backdrops, a technique that hasn't been seen from Disney since the 1960's.  It gives the viewer a sense that this film was lovingly rendered by artists, rather than much of the impersonal computer-generated images we've seen of late.The stark reality of Lilo's situation may disturb some extremely young viewers, as she tries to cope with the loss of her parents.  The writers are to be commended for not trying to soften the very real problems her broken family faces.  It is still very evident, however, that she and her sister love each other, and that they are frantically trying to make their situation work.As in many recent animated successes, they've figured out that satire works, and the film is peppered with pop-culture references that some of the younger viewers might miss altogether.  (There are also a few visual references to some other Disney animated films, which a keen-eyed viewer should be able to pick out.)The music is wonderful:  Some great Elvis classics, and a lovely new original musical score that transports you to the Hawaiian Isles.Overall, I haven't enjoyed a film this much since ""The Iron Giant"", which was of a similar quality and story, but unfortunately did poorly in the box office.  I devoutly hope that the same thing doesn't happen in this case, and that people will let the studio know with their pocketbooks that we wish to see more quality films like this!I thought this film was definitely a 10 out of 10, this is one which will be in my permanent DVD collection!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Stitch"" brings the mouse back to life!","Disney brings back watercolor backgrounds, not since 1941's Dumbo, in this stunningly-awesome looking animated movie. Even with that to boot, Dean Deblois and Chris Sanders managed to come up with a respectable plot that wasn't a complete rip off of E.T. (1982) or even, well, Mac and Me (1988). It's funny to see that the average person who doesn't enjoy any type of Disney production has been favoring this movie more than others, as I feel, it's a pretty nice step for the company. Disney goes flat-out to create a funny character put into a situation where only large laughs are going to occur. The Emperor's New Groove (2000) tried so hard to accomplish that, but fell just short of a home run. `Stitch' gets that extra foot or two.After being created by a mad scientist named Jumba (David Ogden Stiers), Stitch (Chris Sanders) is immediately set aside as a misfit and ordered to spend his life on a remote asteroid. After finding his way to a spacecraft, Stitch outruns the galactic police and crash lands in Hawaii, where is wounded and treated in an animal shelter as a dog. The following day, Lilo (Daveigh Chase), a lonely and misunderstood young girl, arrives at the shelter to adopt a dog after her sister Nani (Tia Carrere) allows her to.Along with the frustrating social worker Mr. Bubbles (Ving Rhames), Stitch proves to be too much for the sisterly duo. Their own relationship, scarred by the death of their parents, starts to fall apart. Lilo feels that Stitch is the only one who understands her, her sister just doesn't respect her anymore, and her peers don't seem to be accepting her at all. Two relationships in this movie are key, with Lilo & Stitch and Lilo & Nani. Acting as the stronger point, Lilo helps transform Stitch and Nani into different people with different priorities, the main one being family.`Ohana,' which means `family,' seems to be one of the largest elements in this film. Being referenced numerous times by Lilo throughout the film, it eventually starts to grow onto Nani and Stitch, until they use it themselves by the end of the film to  well, you'll have to see it for yourselves. Reading some user comments on the film, it seems that most Hawaiians are glad that the message of `ohana' is being used, and the meaning is becoming known a little better. It's almost like if people in Japan made a movie and had the main character say `Yeah baby, yeah!' dozens upon dozens of times. It represents our great culture, so it feels good to let others know about it.The comic character is there, the sappy child-left-behind character is there, the setting is there. Everything seems to be `there' for this really un-sappy (besides a few short moments) cartoon. Oh, and did I mention that this one is awesome enough to contain no please-cry-because-I'm-lonely songs sung by the characters? Just some good ole' fashioned Elvis playing. Even without the tunes, this movie would still be rock n' rollin'.***1/2 out of ****",,Anonymous,Animation
The best Disney movie and the most unique one,"If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing out. If you hated this movie, you obviously don't know what a good movie is.  This movie is top notch on every level, with the exception of acting, since it is an animated feature.  The animation is unbelievable, the cast is terrific, the humor is PERFECT, the story is great, and the runtime is good.  I read in the Boston Globe that Stitch was ugly. They said that he isn't even, ""so ugly he's cute, he's just altogether ugly.""  I couldn't disagree with this more. Stitch is the cutest character, in my opinion, ever to be put on screen, he is cool, and he has a funny voice.  The humor as well as the story and content is very adult-based and warning to parents, some kids may get scared.  Nevertheless, this movie is recommended to EVERY movie viewer.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"One of my favorite ""new"" Disney classics","In ""Lilo & Stitch,"" a lonely Hawaiian girl looks to fill the void in her life with a pet she adopts from an animal shelter. Little does she know that she hasn't taken in any ordinary dog. What she's brought home is a mischievous alien who's an escaped fugitive from another galaxy. Can Lilo tame the little creature before he complicates life for both her and her sister?""Lilo & Stitch"" is one of my favorite ""new"" Disney classics. What's not to love about a terrorizing extraterrestrial that has no sense of self- control and acts like an untamed beast? Add to that his love for classic rock 'n roll and you've got the equivalent of E.T. on crack. The rotten little brat inside me loves the little monster with all my heart.The other reason I adore ""Lilo & Stitch"" is because it's not littered with characters breaking out in song in awkward places. There's music worked into it, but they're believable parts like a dancing number, a surfing scene, and a couple of songs Stitch performs for people or dances to with Lilo. Let's just sum it up by saying this isn't a typical musical.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cowabunga! Go Disney!,"Yeah, Disney has done its magic again. Lilo and Stitch is really one of Disney's greatest animated film. A very enjoyable, fun-filled movie suited for everyone in the family.

The phrase ""Ohana means family, and family means no one gets left behind"" clearly displays the true importance of family unity.It's very rare that animated films entertains as well as educate both major age genre.

"A groovy, heart-warming animation.","In my opinion, this film possibly has one of the most feel good vibe since Hercules. I just smile when I see this film. I love the characters, their designs, that fluid looking animation and the story. The background designs have this simplicity to it. They reminded me alot of Hayao Miyazaki's 2008 animated film, Ponyo. In fact, parts of this film remind me of Ponyo, for some reason. When the humans in Ponyo discover and meet Ponyo's strange family, they kinda accept it, as ir's no big deal. It is just like in thia film, when the humans meet the aliens, they don's seem shocked or suprised, they kinda roll with it. It's my only nit picm with the film. But apart drom that, I 100% recommend this film to people of all ages. It's funny, charming, heart-warming and visually appealing. 😁👍🏾",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another great classic with an adorable blue creature,"When I was a little child, I wanted to see this movie. I watched the ad commercials which was kind of confusing. Whoever thought Disney wanted to put Stitch in Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King to begin with? That question remains a mystery to me, but despite that, I saw it in theaters and was virtually surprised at how good it really is. The reason why I'm giving this a 9/10 is because it's not in the same depth as ""The Lion King"", ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", and several of Disney's films, but it's an emotionally entertaining that still holds up for me as a young adult.The story is original with a nice concept: An experiment made by Dr. Jumbaa with his assistant Dr. Pleakley escapes from a ship and lands in Hawaii where Lilo, a step-sister to Nani, meets him and adopts him before she names him Stitch. It also has some beautiful emotional moments especially the relationship between Lilo and Nani. There are other redeeming qualities such as the likable and charming characters, some excellent voice work from a cast including Chris Sanders, David Ogen Stiers, Kevin McDonald, and others, it's terrific music score from Alan Silvestri and it's beautiful animation with beautiful backgrounds and decent character designs.Overall, Lilo & Stitch is one of the childhood favorites that I usually love and I still love it right now since it's celebrating it's 10 anniversary. Thumbs up from me!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A breath of fresh air,"The first time I went to watch Lilo and Stitch, I went into it with the attitude that it was going to be another sub-par Disney cartoon, in the same ranks as many of the recent sub-par sequels.(102 Dalmatians, Lady and the Tramp 2, etc.)  I had also heard that is was simply a new version of E.T.'s story.I am glad to say, that in my opinion, it is neither. While it may resemble E.T.'s story, in that an alien comes to earth and befriends a child, you will never love E.T. like you love Stitch. He's adorable. Also I think Lilo and Stitch is far more entertaining.The beautiful artwork and animation, the wonderful soundtrack, and loveable characters make this a welcomed breath of fresh air to all Disney fans. And while it may not be in the same league as the gargantuan masterpieces such as The Lion King, it surely stands on its own as a unique and awesome movie.In an age of computer animation, Lilo and Stitch brings Disney back to its roots, where it thrives. I am not against computer animation, however, by showing that Disney's ""magic"" can still be reached using traditional animation (albeit combined with some computer animation) is a step in the right direction, that will hopefully bring Disney back to its past glory.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A decent family film for 2002,"There's nothing grandiose about this Disney film. It is, after all, about a super-strong lonely alien crash-landing on Hawaii and looking for a bit of refuge. What it does accomplish is good, clean, fun entertainment for children AND adults alike in one movie (toss in a few family value lessons, too); something I have yet to seen accomplished in the Summer of 2002. That's all you could really want and Disney does it with good style with nothing over the top. Lilo & Stitch is a pure gem, and certainly worth the time to go see, or if you have already, add to your DVD collection.8/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Something for Walt to be proud of, finally","I like every Disney film I've seen but of course the new classics, The Lion King, Aladdin, and The Little Mermaid have gotten a tiny bit of bad press, and I don't think they're the way Walt would have done them.This one takes the taco. It's not necessarily better than the three I mentioned, and definitely not better than the ones Walt made, but this one is definitely the one that would have made Walt proudest (except Beauty and the Beast, which I'm sure he was looking down and proud of). I can not think of a time when I did not like any part of this movie. In fact I cried when I saw this with my 11 year old niece, who loved this far more than I did, which is funny cause we don't usually agree on animated films.One thing I rolled my eyes about was the overkill of pop songs, though the Elvis ones did have relavance to characterization at least. *shrugs* I still prefer score over pop. At least the score was better than Menken's atrocity he calls score (though Hercules is an exception), but I would rather James Newton Howard bring the same score magic he brought to Atlantis and Dinosaur, here. But Silverstn did a better job than expected.In terms of the movie, plot and characters, just check the other reviews, they say it all!",,Anonymous,Animation
"Among the Disney ""greats"".  Really.","Yup, I'll give it a ten. Lilo & Stitch is right up there with classics like Dumbo and Peter Pan. It's wonderful to see Disney when they get it right.In this case, getting it right meant taking some risks. The animation and art work in L&S are big, bright, and different. Computer aided animation is used sparingly and effectively, particularly in a couple of dance scenes that to my eye made use of some motion capture techniques.The bigger risk here, though, is with a storyline that's somewhat edgier than you'd usually find in a Disney family film. Edgy to the point of earning the movie an unusual PG rating. Lilo is not the most sympathetic of Disney heroines, and her family situation is presented with surprising frankness.There are some lovely messages here, perhaps most prominently that the family you choose can be just as important as the family you're born with. Even with this degree of meaning, though, L&S wouldn't be worth the time it takes to watch if it weren't entertaining as well. Stitch is a very original character, and his creator Jumba is hilarious. The whole Elvis angle shouldn't work at all, but it actually manages to add some charm to the story.Disney animators should look back at this film as clear evidence that traditional 2D animation is far from dead. Instead of trying to compete with Pixar by producing marginal material like Chicken Little, they should leave Pixar to its strength, and return to their own.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I love, love this movie!","""Lilo & Stitch"" is now 10 years old. It's hard to believe this movie came out in 2002. I loved this movie when it first came out, and I still love it even now. ""Lilo & Stitch"" is a cute little picture, but not so cute, really, that it treads sappy over-sentimentality territory. Quite simply, you won't find a simpler better animated feature from Disney in the early 21st century.The story begins when the mad scientist Dr. Jumba (voice of David Ogden Stiers) goes on trial for illegally creating a dangerous extraterrestrial life-form, ""Experiment 626"" (voice of co-director Chris Sanders, who shares directing duties with Dean DeBlois). Jumba receives life imprisonment, while ""Experiment 626"" is to be exiled to another planet. As would be expected, the crafty, cunning little blue-skinned bugger that is ""Experiment 626"" masterminds an escape mid-flight, and manages to high-tail it in a space cruiser to Earth, where his ship crash-lands in the woods on the island of Hawaii.The obnoxious and highly destructive little extraterrestrial is mistaken for a mutated dog and is later adopted by Lilo (voice of Daveigh Chase), a lonely, misunderstood young Hawaiian girl, who later renames ""Experiment 626"" as ""Stitch."" Lilo's living with her older sister Nani (voice of Tia Carrere), who is struggling to make ends meet to support them both in the aftermath of their parents' deaths in a devastating car accident. Pretty soon a little family is born - however marginalized - despite the interference of an imposing social worker, Cobra Bubbles (voice of Ving Rhames); and Jumba and alien-government bureaucrat Pleakly (voice of Kevin McDonald), who have been dispatched to Earth to retrieve Stitch at all costs.I have to say ""Lilo & Stitch"" somehow feels different from other animated Disney features. Obviously, it's still very much aimed at a general family audience (kids), but it also feels very mature; I don't like being preached to by movies - especially kids movies - but ""Lilo & Stitch"" makes the case for family (however bizarre they may sometimes seem, especially when you throw alien fugitives in the mix) and not leaving one behind. We also get a little bit of culture-shock as well, since a great deal of time & effort is spent showcasing Hawaiian native cultures and tradition.The movie itself is great to look at it, with its excellent use of water-based paintings mixed with minimal CGI. Lastly, Stitch is just so cute! I'm a guy, but Stitch is just crazy! Even though Dr. Jumba designed Stitch with only one purpose in life - to destroy anything and everything he comes into contact with - he soon realizes the truth about his own loneliness and isolation and how to come to terms with finding his own place in the universe.This is a fantastic and original Disney animation. I loved it, and you'll love it, too!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A good Experimental Era Disney Film,Lilo & Stitch is a film from Disney's experimental era that takes place in Hawaii that happens to have aliens in it as well. It is the only Disney Experimental Era movie I know I have watched at some point. I could recall having watched it twice. I just rewatched it after seeing that a live action remake is going to be released next year. I find it is a film that the entire family could enjoy and it's definitely a film for Asian/Pacific Islander heritage month in May. Definitely a film for people who like aliens. Stitch may be a character I like with not a lot of reason behind it.This film could be compared to Moana as they both surround Polynesian culture with the main difference being that Lilo & Stitch focuses more specifically on Hawaii and Moana surrounds Polynesia as a whole.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Iconic Disney,"This movie was my favorite all through childhood, and even now as an adult, since this movie centers around the concept that any family is a good family, even if it's not perfect or normal by society's standards. From this movie is my favorite quote and my motto: ""Ohana means family; family means nobody gets left behind, or forgotten"".

Ohana means family...,"This movie brought me to tears the other night. It was a classic for me as a kid (pretty sure I have a VHS copy of it stashed somewhere in the basement...), for its simple storyline and cute and relatable characters. It wasn't until watching it as an adult that I got to see the deeper elements of the movie. I fully understood how Lilo acted out and how truly broken her family is. Lilo and her sister live in what's left of the house their parents left behind. Her sister works odd jobs to make ends meet, and Lilo is socially awkward and unable to make friends. But underneath this, she has a heart of gold. And so does her companion, Stitch, who created as just an experiment by aliens in another galaxy, longs for a family. The scene in the forest where he cries out ""I'm Lost"", in the hopes that his family will come find him, had me sobbing.This is a truly heart warming and enjoyable movie for all ages.

Better than you think,"Alright, I gotta admit: I went to DisneyWorld in March of 2002 to get a first-hand look/preview of this movie and I thought to myself ""Well, I suppose after hacking through all the classics, Disney decides to go for something original, though that's what will make it outright stupid.""Then I saw it in theaters with family, and I gotta say, the only problem I had with it was that it was too short. Other than that, I'd say this one was a winner.First off, Stitch is the cutest original character since I can remember. (Yea, I'm a heterosexual adult male saying this, but I'm giving credit where it's due.) Maybe it's the fact that he's not a typical cutesey teddy bear, but a bit of a punk in a Disneyfied version... but that's ok cause it still works. Example: Seeing him with the cape and bra at the end credits is both funny and an ""awwww"" moment.Lilo comes off as a brat I'd love to smack upside the head a few times (and the way that Nani deals with her is great too)... but then you start to pretty much identify with her when Stitch comes along and all is well again. Dr Jumba and Pleakley are great characters and funny, not irritating (as some Disney comic reliefs are)...The previews for the movie (that you can see on the DVD) are hilarious as well, and it's good to see that not all of Disney is so incredibly PC and sugar-coated... (Stitch steals Aladdin's girl: funniest thing I've seen from Disney in years)And also, it's rather moving (at times) for a Disney movie, so all in all, seems like good fun for all ages as long as you give it a chance...

Already a favorite,"I was very, very bad about seeing new movies last year. I really wanted to catch Lilo and Stitch, but didn't get to until the DVD. I hope it comes to the IMAX or something, because I think it could easily replace The Rescuers as my favorite Disney movie. Just when I thought that Disney was going down the tubes, they come roaring back with this new classic.Everything about this movie is brilliant, beautiful, and original. I think they should keep on using watercolor backgrounds, because it has the feel of a real classic from the '40s. The Elvis music was a great touch! No out-of-place song and dance numbers here, folks, it's very nicely embedded in the background.I've heard criticism regarding Lilo and Nani's constant arguing, but this is exactly what sisters do, no matter how much they love each other. Sure, I don't think real life loving sisters would go quite that far, but it was a breath of fresh air from the Brady Bunch-like atmospheres from a lot of other Disney movies.Lilo and Stitch will still be loved for a very long time, and rightfully so, because it's like no other Disney film, and they'll never even come close again.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

hilarious and more Warner than Disney,"This is an unusual cartoon for its time hand drawn amidst a world of Toy Story clones and with a wacky, frenetic sense of humor more reminiscent of old Warner brother cartoons then of the more genial Disney approach.It's gorgeous, funny, and surprisingly sweet for all its insanity, focusing on the strained relationship between two sisters.Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Outstanding Film,"Lilo and Stitch (2002) is comedic family film filled with irony. The story consists of a genetically engineered alien, Stitch voiced by Chris Sanders, landing on earth and using a dysfunctional family, Lilo voiced by Daveigh Chase and Nani voiced by Tia Carrere, threatened to be separated by Child Protection Services as a cover. The irony exist in how similar Lilo and Stitch truly are. Lilo is somewhat an outcast, unruly and undisciplined much like Stitch who is also destructive.Chris Sanders, creator of ""The Lion King"" and Dean DeBlois, co-creator of ""Mulan,"" maintain their fine ability to match musical tracks and scores with the location and feel of the film. The opening song, He Mele No Lilo performed by Mark Keali'i Ho'omalu, effectively placed my mind in Hawaii. Elvis,' Heartbreak hotel captures the essence of Lilo's mood after her episode at the dance academy. The music portrayed in this film was perfect.The animation was consistent with animated films of its time, but the vibrant water colors made the movie pop. The film had equal parts of child comedy and adult comedy making it fun for all. When agent Pleakly, voiced by Kevin McDonald, generalized the human race as not intellectually apt, I found it hilarious especially at the end. Mr. Bubbles, voiced by Ving Rhames, is ironically named because he is far from bubbly. Overall this film is a class act for all.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Life...in about an hour,"A genetic experiment designed for destruction and adaptability bends space and time to escape from his confinement and imminent destruction. Naturally, he ends up in Hawaii. During his escape the implication is that the potential for destruction is great. However, we find that our little anomaly is the ideal partner for a pair of orphans who also desire escape from their unfortunate existential circumstances.Lilo & Nani, meet Stitch. Stitch, meet Lilo & Nani.Despite the apparent difficulty inherent in merging an orphan alien with destructive tendencies into a broken Hawaiian family the writers for Lilo & Stitch pull it off perfectly. It turns out that an alien destroyer is just what a broken family needs, but not really in the typical Disney way wherein all of the pieces fall together to make the lives wholesome and unrealistic. In the end pieces fall, they are broken pieces, and they merge to give a broken social environment a new hope.All difficulties are wrapped up in the end and humor abounds.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
great movie with cool animation,"this movie was pretty good.....actually great! by the commericals, i expected it would be bad. stitch as my dad called him looked like a menace. i just decided to put my judgment aside and check it out for myself. we were in hawaii at the time the movie was in theatres (interesting coincidence). unfortunately, we never got to see it in hawaii. when we got back to texas a few days later, my mom, my friend, and me saw it. boy did i misjudge! this movie was awesome! i have never yet seen a disney movie with this sort of watercolor animations. the art and hawaiian scenery was beautiful. the plot is interesting as well. stitch is so cute! great clean movie for the kids. the aliens might be a little bit scary but otherwise its great. check it out. you won't regret it! 10 stars out of 10.",,Anonymous,Animation

Cute enjoyable film.,I took a five year old and found the film to be more charming than I expected.  We laughed at Stich's antics and enjoyed the dancing and singing in Hawaian (I assume it was Hawaian).  My little friend is learning dance at the Y and wanted to see the film because they do the same dance.  Much of the humor is aimed at adults and the social worker made me uncomfortable.  I know too many social workers that would be offended by his attitude but he turns out okay in the end.  All in all it was a fun film to take a child to and the violence is alien based and not to scarry.,9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Doesn't feel like Disney territory,"I had almost given up on Disney; the animation is lackluster, the stories are either tired reworking of old plots or feel-good messages with souring soundtracks and flowing hair.  But the advertising for Lilo & Stitch caught my attention for one reason: the main characters are naughty!  They are really messed up!  Lilo, who you have to love from the minute she's introduced, is truly angry, and she shows it.  The bit with the voodoo doll (just see it) was heartbreakingly honest.  And watching Stitch try in vain to destroy San Francisco...  I don't know if I've ever seen characters in a kid's movie be so destructive, even in such a misguided way.  And while, yes, it seems a little simple to say that these two just want to be loved and then all their problems will be solved, there is no denying that little kids DO just want to be loved.  The adult character were equally engaging, and it was nice to see some healthy legs on the big sister.  Come to think of it, Lilo wasn't model thin, either, but that didn't stop her from being adorable.  Unlike some recent (and wonderful) animated films, this doesn't offer as much in the way of ""hidden"" adult jokes.  But sometimes you just gotta pretend you're a kid and go with it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
It was a great family film!!!,I think that Lilo and Stitch is the cutest movie ever animated. Even though Stitch is an alien dog he is still really Cute.

Lot's of Fun!,"This movie was truly a pleasant surprise.  With many Disney movies pushing ""social issues"" we were afraid that this movie would follow right along in that same pattern.As the movie started the 'New Age/World' music gave us the impression that we were right, but then it went away never to be revisited.  From that point onward, the movie was a relatively fast paced, warm, and enjoyable flick with believable characters that weren't too stereotypical.  These well-developed characters made the standard, straightforward plot invisible because of viewer empathy.We heartily laughed numerous times, felt that the choice of Hawaii as the location was a nice change of pace, and felt good after watching this film.

With a Heart Filled with Mahalo (Thank You) for all involved...,"Aloha ka~kou (Aloha to All of Us),Yesterday, with great anticipation -- yes, with bated breaths -- we, my husband and I who were born in Hawai`i fifty years ago and raised there, went to see LILO AND STITCH at our local theatre, hoping for its unmitigated success and yet knowing it could be yet another dirty bomb unwittingly directed against the Hawaiian culture.We were utterly impressed with LILO & STITCH's shining truth and loved and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the galactic high adventure and its down-to-Earth (literally) endearing story, brimming full of Aloha of the real, day-to-day variety, not the syrupy, touristy stuff. Having been raised with Disney movies, ourselves, we were delighted with its high caliber Disney feel and animation mastery, especially the stunningly gorgeous water-color visuals of our homeland.Chris Sanders and Dean DeBlois bolstered our faith in the next generation of moviemakers.  I dare say that they are uniquely enlightened young people, wise beyond their years.  Certainly, this movie is not yet another run-of-the-mill, Hawaiian-themed fantasy that my generation has come to expect out of Hollywood. We've seen, rolled our eyes upward, and laughed at the ludicrousness of too many hurriedly slapped together movies based on deluded, overly-dramatized or white-washed, idealized visions and versions of Hawaiian culture and its people.Instead, it was clearly evident to us that the research that went into LILO AND STITCH was done with thoroughness, sincerity, concern and care.The result? A movie with a huge sensitivity, concern and Aloha for our endangered Hawaiian and local culture, which, with a combination of ""attitude"" and sweetness, captures the authentic spirit and genuine warmth, and inner and outer beauty of Hawai`i, especially its unique Aloha Spirit and valuing of `ohana (family).In its unique, far-reaching way, LILO and STITCH -- and Disney --  will help to perpetuate Hawaiian ways, beingness, and arts, as well as our one-of-a-kind local culture.  I loved the snippets of pidgin, for most of us, our first language.  Tia Carrere and Jason Scott Lee were perfect in their voice roles as Nani and Kawika (David).  For a change, true locals playing local roles with every truthful and subtle nuance.Loving Hawaiian music as I do, I am particularly grateful for the inclusion of authentic Hawaiian musicianry: the mesmerizing, lively chants by real-life Hawaiian chanter, Mark Keali`i Ho`omalu, were right-on. The casting of real-life kumu hula (hula master)Kunewa Mook as the voice of the hula teacher in the movie was exactly pono (right and proper); his input on depicting hulas as it is actually danced, and not the swishy hula gibberish of past Hollywood movies was greatly appreciated by us, his peers.And singing by the Kamehameha Schools Children's Chorus -- you must have indigenous blood to go to school there -- could not have been truer or more delightful.  Ahh.... I am going out to buy the CD ASAP!Of course, we grew up with Elvis' classic tunes, so we absolutely loved the resurrection of his songs as well as Wynonna's rendition of ""Burning Love."" A perfect balance to the Hawaiian music.  Pono, which means not only right and proper, but balanced.We spotted only one glaring mistake: the shakkah (""all is cool"") sign as depicted in the movie at the end.  They got the fingers right, but the way they did it, it's only half of the shakkah sign.  As it was, it stopped as the Texas Longhorn symbol. Locals then swivel their wrist, 180 degrees, completing the local sign with the BACK of the hand toward the viewer. Oh well, as we say in Hawai`i:  ""Ain't no big t'ing, braddah"" as the moviemakers can fix that faux pas for the video version.A big MAHALO (THANK YOU) to all involved, viewers included, who make LILO & STITCH the sharing movie it is.

Very un-disney-like!,"I give major props to the makers of ""lilo and Stitch"". This movie is not what I expected which is a good thing since everything nowadays is so predictable! The characters in this film aren't fake blown out characters...they're real! Lilo and Nani's relationship as sisters resemble me and my sister's relationship so much I had to laugh at the resemblence! Stitch is a different and adorable character and when he speaks it's sooo cute! Combining alien beings and a lil' sci-fi action with a cute hawaiian family story is something I would never expect to see! To sum up this movie in one word it would have to be....DIFFERENT!! People need to get over the fact that its not computer animated because it doesn't matter. The story is great just how it is! One thing I don't get is critics! They said that Disney should of advertised the movie better! WHAT?? I thought it was perfect!! Putting Stitch in the classic Disney movies was hilarious and different and was my whole reason for going to see this film! The hawaiian music is great also! Lilo is not an ordinary innocent little girl and that's great. She's not perfect so we can relate to her more and frankly, watching her jam to Elvis is hilarious! Her family isn't perfect either and the villain in the story is also the hero. So you want to hate Stitch but you can't help loving him either! GO SEE LILO AND STITCH!!!!

You have a rogue alien that crash lands on earth who gets adopted and learns what it means to be a part of a family, even if it's ""broken.""Chris Sanders who voices Stitch does such a great job at voicing him and has so many underappreciated line deliveries. He worked really well with little Daveigh Chase who voiced Lilo, and she had a solid arc throughout the movie as well.Great Voice Acting, Great Art Direction, Great Sound Design, and tastefully done Sci-Fi Action.

"Finally, Hawaii portrayed accurately.","For those of you who have spent any time in Hawaii, you have seen too many movies set in Hawaii with people PRETENDING to be ""local"" to Hawaii.  Lilo and Stitch is NOT one of those movies.Someone wised up and cast people who were raised in Hawaii!  It's about time!  Fake Pidgin accents are too easy to pick up for any one that's ever spent more than a year in Hawaii.  Too often the fake pidgin accent will ruin a movie.Accents aside, the movie really captures the feel of Hawaii.  The first scenes with Lilo swimming with the fishes and the Kamehameha Childrens Choir singing made me misty eyed (and I almost bought a ticket to go back home to Hawaii immediately).If you are from Hawaii and you have your doubts because so many movies in the past have horrible portrayals of Hawaii and Hawaiians . . .

The ""My friends need to be punished"" line kills me everytime 🤣🤣🤣 Not only that but there is tons of memorable characters. With the iconic Stitch being one of them. It's also very heart warming as well. This is my fiancee's favorite Disney film, for the fact of showing life of a child in a custody predicament. My fiancee delt with that a lot growing up, and I think it is great for Disney to have shown that lifestyle even back in the late 90s early 2000's.

"The ""Dumbo"" of the 00's.","I mean think about it: it has a similar style of animation, had a remarkably lower budget than the movies which preceeded it, it actually made a fair amount of money after a string of disappointing outcomes. Even though I think that either critics or audiences or both were a little too harsh on certain Disney movies of the 00's, I can certainly see why Lilo & Stitch reigns supreme as the best of the second dark age of Disney.It all comes down to one simple thing: the story.Lilo & Stitch takes up great themes of family and responsibility. The relationship between Nani and Lilo is so real and touching. Spicing it up with an alien coming to Earth was an odd choice, but Stitch is both cute, entertaining and serves a purpose. A big one actually.I'd say that that is both a blessing and a curse, because it gives the movie a feel of wanting to be two movies at the same time. It is not as distracting as, let's say, Meeko and Percy in Pocahontas or the gargoyls in Hunchback of Notre Dame, but Stitch steals the show and I first discovered the real heart of the movie when I watched it again as an adult. No hate, just a note. But it makes the movie unique in its own way and therfor it does not affect my rating.I love the characters! No one is dragging the movie down. They're all likable and entertaining, but Nani and Lilo are the emotional center of the movie. David Ogden Stiers' performance as Jumba is my favorite along with Chris Sanders as Stitch and Daveigh Chase as Lilo. They have the funniest lines and bounce off of their surroundings perfectly.If you haven't watched Lilo & Stitch since your child I highly recommend that you do it, because a beautiful story like this is perhaps even better for adults .",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I enjoyed the fact that Disney was portraying an imperfect family in any imperfect world. Nowadays it not out of the ordinary for kids to come from broken homes. I think it was a nice touch portraying to kids the importance of family without centralizing on picture perfect families. I think Disney has done a wonderful job adjusting to the times, I have to admit I found stitch so hilarious that I was laughing most of the time.

Well-balanced Disney animated comedy!,"Set in the modern times, Disney made more justifiable use of modern-day dialog; however, even so, the script was not overblown with mindless jokes and Hollywood-style clichés. It's a good, well-balanced and captivating film about a Hawaiian girl named Lilo who adopts a fugitive alien (whom she later names Stitch), on the run from the mad alien scientist who created him and is on orders to take him back to their planet for incarceration.It's a fun story full of laughable moments and adventures, from Stitch constantly getting Lilo and her old sister Nani in trouble with their social worker to Stitch dodging his pursuing captors left and right. The subplot about Nani trying to keep Lilo from being taken away by social services and the theme about ""no family gets left behind"" are very heartfelt points to the story and provides redeeming qualities to our character leads and touches of drama to the overall plot. It gives ""heart"" to the movie, something that was sorely missing in the last few Disney entries. It was wonderful seeing how the characters including Lilo and Stitch develop throughout the course of the film.I would, though, have liked to see our human characters become more alarmed after spotting Stitch and the other aliens, because it is not everyday you see space creatures roam around in your backyard.The animation is great, capturing the beauty, care-freeness and freshness of Hawaii, and Alan Silvestri's music score is excellent; I especially enjoyed the Hawaiian-theme pieces that Silvestri interwoven into the score.At 85 minutes, this is a well-paced film with a good balance of comedy, drama, adventures and surprises to keep you entertained and is what I think one of the best Disney animated films to come out of the 2000s.Grade B+",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

surprising hit,"Considering that the Disney corporation has in recent years downsized its traditional cell department for computer animation, it is a relief that ""Lilo and Stitch"" did as well as it did with such a bold style.  The film is a radical departure from the traditional Disney formula.  Unlike past films there are no cute cuddly mascot-like side characters like Abu (Aladdin) or Meeko and Flit (Pocahontas) to muddle up the plot or steal the comedy. The laughs are completely owned by the main players --- Dani, Lilo, Stitch, et al.  Also refreshing is the bold anime-like style that is used by the studio.  It has been a long time ---at least since the 1940s that the Disney Corporation has chosen such a direction and it works so well here.  The lush colours and the lack of details (which reminded me more of the latest selection from the Legend of Zelda than it does of Disney) was refreshing. Also bold was the setting --- science fiction is very a-typical of tradional Disney fare).  The characters were also different as is the direction of the plot.  I almost expected a different ending to this picture but Disney remained true to its traditions --- at least in this one respect. Although this film might be seen in the future as perhaps the death knell of cell productions, (and I hope this is not the trend) what a masterful close to an era it makes.",,Anonymous,Animation
A relevant and modern take on found family and aliens as pets.,"The early 2000s were a weird time for Disney. After a solid run of their 1990s renaissance-full of classics beloved by all-they started exploring ideas outside their wheelhouse. With most of their best work in the fantasy genre, Disney hadn't quite figured out how to do science fiction. Despite all this, they created a few cult classics during this period. One of these was none other than Lilo & Stitch (2002).A common theme in children's movies seems to be outsider kids befriending creatures they probably shouldn't. This list includes (but is not limited to) E. T. - The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), The Iron Giant (1999), How to Train Your Dragon (2010), and even Bumblebee (2018). Where Lilo & Stitch takes this a step further is how it embraces the idea of the ""found family."" With so many orphans in Disney movies, it surprised me it took this long to hone in on this trope and really refine it (albeit not nearly to the extent One Piece does). Furthermore, this movie also shows that everyone deserves love, even if they have a sordid past.While there are a lot of common tropes in Lilo & Stitch-including some of its humor, which itself has graciously few bathroom-focused jokes-one of its best characteristics is the realism of its human characters. Relying on evil stepmothers or narcissistic queens as villains hides much more relatable challenges modern families face. Just trying to survive, especially when there are no parents in the picture, is hard. Being able to rely on those around us is a much better lesson for kids than princesses finding out they're a special.A relevant and modern take on found family and aliens as pets, I give Lilo & Stitch 4.0 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very good,"I don't think it's a masterpiece, but he treats a very recurrent theme nowadays, which is the new concept of family. I think that a film uses very playful arguments to make children and adults reflect on concepts such as: child mourning, abandonment, adoption, family emotional ties and bullying and acceptance of differences. However, he sins in some parts regarding continuity and a sense of logic, especially regarding the construction of Agent Bubbles and crazy scientist Jumba, but nothing that is noticeable to children in general. Some adults, however, may find these slips to be somewhat primary, especially considering that it is a Disney production. The emotionally charged dialogues and Elvis' soundtrack are a show apart, in addition to the character Stitch who is captivating. Super recommended for the whole family.Film reviewed on December 11 to December 12, 2020.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
You'll want a Stitch for yourself!,"It's a Disney film. You love or hate or sometimes just go eh. But Lilo and Stitch for me as a kid made me want a pet and Stitch himself. As an older adult now I still can sit and watch this movie and still love every part about the movie. And you can't go wrong with Elvis songs either. I can't see anyone hating on Stitch. You feel for Lilo as well, and her sister. I am thankful for Disney to give me this movie. I am a fanatic about Stitch and just love the short temper alien he is.Kids will love him, be warned tho! They'll want to try and go adopt a pet! Probably not but still, I wanted to at the young age. Throughout the Disney movies you will find one that speaks to you, and being tough with Lion King I have to say Stitch is my choice. If you haven't seen Lilo & Stitch, by goodness see it! Now also being that I love Stitch and watching the sequels. If you know anything about Disney and their sequels(Mulan 2, Little Mermaid 2, etc) you'll know it doesn't end well. The sequels for Stitch are bad. Not the best, watchable but eh. Kids will love them too but teens and adults will surely pass over those. But the original Lilo and Stitch, 10/10. Great movie, truly.

An Absolutely Legendary film of Ohana. Zippity-Doo-Dah.,"Lilo and Stitch is one of my favorite Disney movies as it covers so many topics and covers them well. Firstly, concerning Lilo's feeding the fish, well, all kids have little quirks and this is obviously meant to be her's. As for Nani being a care giver, well, she's supposed to be in her teens, dealing with her parents's loss as well as dealing with her sister's and taking care of the little girl under the pressure of keeping her family together, finding work etc. and it was nice as my 14 year old daughter pointed out, that Nani was like a real woman, with her little pot belly and not very stick thin build, for me she is a great character for little girls who have to put up with cartoon females such as the impossibly(pardon the pun)thin Kim Possible, which is sadly also a Disney cartoon girl. Actually, I tend not to look too deeply into movies unless they are there to make us do so, e.g Schindler's List, but, this movie covered some subjects that I am familiar with, a young child losing it's parents and it dealt with them well. The scene where Stitch takes the bicycle, well, how could anyone feel sorry for the little girl considering she is the monstrous brat in the movie. Anyway, I love the movie and I've watched it many times and am a hand on heart Stitch fan.

For a strange reason I liked it!!!,"Lilo and Stitch was written and directed by Chris Sanders and Dean De Blois. This animated film is the typical movie with the same problems as in most of the films.This is the story of a little girl called Lilo who lives with Nani, her sister. They lost their parents and have problems with the social assistant. One day Lilo adopted a strange pet called Stitch. Stitch was not a normal pet, he was a runaway from another planet.The plot was fairly good, but this kind of film has nothing special for me.

surprisingly good,"all i heard for months was how adorable lilo & stitch was.  time after time i have heard this about a movie, then come to find that the movie was far less than i expected.  so when i finally got around to seeing lilo & stitch i was more than surprised.  the film was not only adorable but was, for the most part, a very real and touching family tale.  while the opening and ending action is mostly for the kids, the central story of lilo, her sister, nani, and their unusual new pet, stitch is fun for all.  i couldn't help but laugh out loud at times, and yes, i even cried.  the characters and relationships are not only well-developed, but are also, generally believable for a story that deals with aliens.  fun and heartfelt, lilo & stitch is a near-perfect mixture of laughter and tears that balances the real with the outrageous and rides the wave of success clear in to shore.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Charming and hearty,"Cute film.'Lilo & Stitch' is a short and straightforward production, but that doesn't stop it leaving a charming and hearty impression. It's actually rather impressive in that regard, you can't help but feel attached to the main characters.Daveigh Chase (Lilo), Tia Carrere (Nani), David Ogden Stiers (Jumba), Kevin McDonald (Pleakley) and, obviously, Chris Sanders (Stitch) are very good. I love their respective voices. Even some of the minor characters, like Zoe Caldwell (Councilwoman), Kevin Michael Richardson (Capt. Gantu) and Ving Rhames (Bubbles), are memorable too. A real cool set.Animation-wise it isn't actually sensational, undoubtedly pleasant, but not out of this world or anything. As for the music, who knew Elvis Presley's discography would fit so well? An inspired choice, it must be said.Not at the top of my list of Disney animated films, but it's certainly in the 'best of the rest' bracket. You should definitely watch this, if you haven't already.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very Entertaining Film About a Dog Who's Really an Alien,"Lilo and Stitch is a 2002 animated film released by Walt Disney Pictures. Set on the beautifully lush, tropical island of Hawaii, the story is about a girl named Lilo (voiced by Daveigh Chase) who can't seem to make any friends. Then one day, her sister Nani (voiced by Tia Carrere) takes her to the Pet Store and she adopts a ""dog"" who she names Stitch that is really an alien experiment named 626. Once Stitch (626) escapes the space station, his jailed creator Jumbaa (voiced by David Ogden Stiers) and accomplice Pleakley (voiced by Kevin McDonald) are commissioned by the Grand Councilwoman to bring him back and reward Jumbaa his freedom in return for Stitch's capture. Underlying in this plot is Captain Gantu (voiced by Kevin Michael Richardson), who, once Jumbaa and Pleakley fail to capture Stitch numerous times, is sent to capture Stitch. When this movie was released back in 2002, there were numerous teaser trailers placing Stitch in some of the most memorable moments in Disney films like ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"", and ""The Lion King"", which just happen to be films in the Disney Renaissance Era. Those previews were what really made me say ""Wow! This is gonna be a great Disney movie!"" Sure enough, it was, and still holds up 10 years later. Stitch, by far has got to be one of the funniest characters in Disney history. There was even a great message in the film: Ohana means family. Family means nobody gets left behind. The scene at the end where Stitch almost had to leave Lilo behind is one of the most emotionally filled scenes I've ever seen in any Disney movie. All in all, Lilo and Stitch is one of the better films in the Disney cannon and to be honest, (aside from the brilliant Toy Story trilogy, Up, and Monsters, Inc.) is better than most Pixar movies that get way too much attention in my opinion. It has all elements of classic Disney with a touch of Elvis Presley! Like many Disney movies, this is one that I have in my ever-growing movie library! This is a film that should not be missed by anyone who's a Disney fan or that has children. Despite the PG rating, it's a great, entertaining film for the entire family!!!

Lilo and Stitch,"Lilo and Stitch is an excellent, family friendly movie that the whole family will enjoy. The plot is that an evil genius that is an alien creates stitch, a bulletproof life form that was designed to destroy things. Meanwhile, a Hawaiian girl wants a friend. Stitch ended up in Hawaii and the Aliens rush to capture stitch and Lilo finds an unexpected friend. With family trouble in Lilo's home and intergalactic trouble for stitch, the two find their paths intersecting.This movie is a fun adventure for the whole family. It is full of good themes. Themes like family, kindness, and friendship. In Lilo's home, a social worker wants to take Lilo away from her guardian, her sister. The two must struggle to get along and not yell at each other. Lilo also must get along with the people who make fun of her. Lilo often gets in fights with the other kids and Lilo must learn how to be kind. She must also prove to the aliens that stitch is not evil but is a good friend. These are all very important lessons that can be learned from this move.

"Authentic, heart-warming and bittersweet!","Lilo and Stitch is a unique Disney film and probably their most under-rated movie to date! It depicts the journey of a young orphan named Lilo, and her relation with an Alien species (Stitch). These two characters have fundamental similarities in that they are both misfits and somewhat outcasts in their communities, going through imminent struggles and are longing to find a feeling of belonging and acceptance. Throughout their journey they overcome challenges regarding familial instability, loss & grief, ridicule, judgement and some personality clashes. But nonetheless, the perseverance and genuity amongst everyone involved is what brings the characters together and makes them a unique family unit.Essentially, Lilo & Stitch illustrates acceptance, patience, resilience and forgiveness. And of course, there is the emphasis on Ohana (family). I believe it also encourages uniqueness and individuality, as we see that all characters in this movie not only have physical differences, but their personalities are distinct and very likeable! :)I think the writers and directors did a fantastic job in representing the Hawai'ian culture, which encompasses many of the traits mentioned above. As well as that, the animation in surfing/swimming scenes as well as during Hula are well put together for an animated film in 2002 lol! So kudos to them for the accuracy in representing this Polynesian culture! The soundtrack in this film is also good & fun-loving. This film is very genuine, heart-warming and bittersweet.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Nice, but just not...","I recently saw LaS, I just wanted to say that in the first half of the movie I was amazed at all the animation and wonderous atmosphere that Disney created, and had forgotten how to do with 2-D animation. The character of Experiment 626 ( Stitch) was somewhat frightening in a way. When one sees the trailers, one assumes that he's perhaps a slave or some animal used in tormenting scientific experimentaions. When in fact, he's an artificial killing machine in a compact body. And my 5 year old nephew was first frightened of Stitch, and he really couldn't relate to him at first. Then, Stitch got domesticated and my nephew, Christopher, began to like him. But, his image I think has scared children and they just don't want to see him if he's not cute and cuddly. And the other half of the film was so-so.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Boasting a deceptive level of depth beneath its comic sci-fi premise, Lilo & Stitch is one of the better post Disney Renaissance releases by Disney animation.","In the alien United Galactic Federation, mad scientist Dr. Jumba Jookiba (David Ogden Stiers) is put on trial for conducting illegal genetic research with his creation Experiment 626 (Chris Sanders) used as evidence of how immoral his research is as 626 was designed to be indestructible and destructive and seemingly possesses no redeeming qualities. Jumba is sentenced to prison while 626 will be banished to an asteroid, but 626 hijacks a Federation craft and escapes to Earth where he crashes on the Hawaiian Island of Kaua'i. Unable to directly engage the 626 on the planet due to Earth's protective status for environmental reasons, the Federation cuts a deal with Jumba to use his knowledge of 626 to capture him in exchange for a pardon with meek Agent Pleakley (Kevin McDonald) assigned to keep Jumba in check. On Kaua'I, 626 is adopted (disguising himself as a dog, whom Lilo names Stitch) by sisters oddball Lilo (Daveigh Chase) and Lilo's older sister Nani (Tia Carre) who's Lilo's legal guardian after having lost their parents in a car accident. As Nani deals with a stern but sympathetic social worker Cobra Bubbles (Ving Rhames), Lilo struggles with being an outsider due to her eccentricities while Stitch struggles to keep his destructive instincts in check.Beginning development in the mid-90s with the intention of making a smaller more economically priced animated film in comparison to the consistently larger budgeted animated epics, director Chris Sanders salvaged an abandoned storybook pitch tand repurposed it as a concept for a lower budgeted animated film set in a remote non-urban location which eventually became Hawaii after the animators realized no animated film had used the location. With the animation being more frugal most of the work was based on 2D animation with the approach being compared stylistically to Dumbo which while lower budgeted was allowed to take more experimental approaches to the animation and storytelling. The movie was noted for its unique marketing approach where trailers featuring scenes from other Disney films such as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, and The Lion King would play only for Stitch to crash the scene and wreak his own brand of havoc and gave the film a very ""anti-Disney"" approach to the audience. Not only did the movie get solid critical reception after the rather tepid response to Atlantis: The Lost Empire, but it also became one of the few post 2000 2D animated films to be a bona fide hit and was the first time since 1999's Tarzan a Disney animated film had been successful and launched an expanded media franchise. While the movie delivers on a lot of the crazy anarchic humor promised in the marketing, it's the human elements that really work in the story and resonate with the audience and subtle way against the bombast of the high concept sci-fi stuff.Lilo & Stitch allows itself more freedom in both the designs and animation with the character designs and environments being more simplified and exaggerated but still fitting the tone of the story and allowing themselves to be both funny and expressive. The scenes in space feature the more elaborate sequences involving complex modeling and movement while the scenes in Hawaii are more grounded with simple but expressive elements. Artistically it uses its more limited budget to solid effect and using watercolor backgrounds which had largely been abandoned since the 40s are beautifully realized and give the film a storybook type quality.The movie's plot at its core is sort of a mixture of Gremlins, E. T., and maybe some Critters with even Stitch himself baring a superficial resemblance to some of those designs you remember from the Joe Dante classic and even the plot about Stitch being hunted by two other aliens is reminiscent of the alien bounty hunters from the Critters film, although the movie never gets to the same level of edge as those films did. The stuff involving Stitch and the high concept sci-fi nonsense is decent if not particularly exceptional, but it's in the human characters where the writing really shines with the film creating an interesting set of characters with Nani, Lilo, and Cobra Bubbles as we get a strongly realized portrayal of a broken family trying to stay together. Nani and Lilo are in a situation where Nani is saddled with being a parent to her sister and not only is Lilo already not an easy child to deal with being odd and even having somewhat macabre tastes and humor, but Nani has largely needed to put her life on hold in order to perform this role that she's not prepared for. Cobra Bubbles despite presenting a conflict of potentially taking Lilo away from Nani isn't a two dimensional antagonist and he's given more depth than you typically see in this character type where he does make good points and is clearly sorry to have to be the one to make this decision, but it is one that needs to be made.Lilo & Stitch is an interesting movie because it was sold as a very over the top and crazy ""anti-Disney"" film for the post-Shrek era of animation and while that can probably be at least somewhat credited with getting butts in the seats, I think it's in the unexpected quality of the storytelling and characters that kept people coming back enough to make it a hit. The stuff involving Stitch and the aliens is just kind of okay and doesn't go too far above what we've seen destructive diminutive critters of a similar nature. The dynamic between Lilo and Nani as well as the exploration of broken families is what gives this film that little bit of meat that helped to make the film more substantive than you'd think.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

GO SEE THIS MOVIE!,"This movie was SO GREAT!  I am so happy my son got me to go see it.It really has everything: cute cuddly characters in idyllic settings, suspenseful chases, space aliens, Star Wars spoofs, social commentary, love, the frustrations of dealing with and also of being an ill-behaved child, family dysfunction, humor, sadness, adventure, romance, fabulous surfing, and a happy ending.Somehow the movie managed to have very complex, subtle character development worthy of high literature and still remain appealing to children.  This is totally different from your typical cartoons, which inspired the concept of ""cartoonish characters.""    In ""Lilo & Stitch,"" people are deep and believable.  They actually suffer from poverty and have to deal with government bureaucracy.CAVEAT:  I still don't think that any Disney movies are suitable for pre-schoolers, because there is suspense and some violence.  My kids are 8 and 11, which I think are ideal ages for most Disney movies.The good thing here is that the suspense is different from most other kids' movies.  There are not really any good or bad guys.  There are just a bunch of fairly confused, bumbling people and aliens who all have their own points of view.  Importantly, the movie carries the message that different and conflicting views can be reconciled, that problems do not have to be solved by killing major characters.  This is the message that we want to give our children for how to live in our crowded world, not that we can kill off our enemies, but that we have to find a way to share space with them.I guess it's really a girl's movie, like ""Pocahantas"" was, but my sons liked it anyway.",,Anonymous,Animation
Lilo & Stitch is beautiful.,"Personally, my favourite Disney films of all time just so happen to be 2 films that came out in 2002. Lilo & Stitch and Treasure Planet. Why you ask? It's because they're the only ones that feel a lot more mature than the rest of Disney films, and focusing now only on Lilo & Stitch, I have to say it is simply stunning and beautiful. Story tackles many real life problems like loneliness, acceptance, alienation, family, friends, and so on, and does so so remarkably well that I sometimes forget that this is a Disney film and not pixar's. The art is beautiful, this film always reminds me of summer and beach, and every credit goes to animation too. I'm not afraid to say that it reached my emotional peak during at least 5 scenes and made me shed a tear, first time it is sadness, other time it is happiness, and than another time it is plain beauty.

20 days of Disney Day 3: Lilo and Stitch,"Ok, so I hate to say it. I have NEVER seen this film until yesterday. And everyone is saying I should review it. Everyone got me hyped. And... I don't just like this film. I REALLY like this film. Okay so it's not Lion King, but it's still up there with something like Treasure Planet or Bambi for me. The story is Lilo is a young Hawaiian girl who adopts a pet she thinks is a dog. In real life this is an alien named Stitch. He is an experiment made by Jumba Jookiba, an alien scientist who, along with his friend Pleakley, is on the chase to find Stitch and take him back to his home planet. So obviously my favorite part is Stitch. This guy is so funny and so original for Disney. And then there's Lilo. I don't think she's terrible, but I think she's kind of Boring... as for the aliens, Jumba is pretty funny and gets a few laughs, Pleakley is pretty funny as well. I just wish I got that with Lilo. In fact, I thought all of the human characters were boring. But for the aliens, I do recommend this visually and comedic gem.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Touches the heart and tickles the funny bone,"Disney has spent the passed few years as the victim of falling box office receipts for its traditionally animated films.  Some (i.e. ""The Emperor's New Groove"", ""Fantasia 2000"") were because of poor marketing and release schedules.  Others (like ""Atlantis"") just didn't seem to carry the standard of Disney animation.  Well, that all ends with ""Lilo and Stitch"" The story is bright, funny and heartfelt.  While I had heard many warnings about the character of Stitch, I found him to be one of the most unique and interesting of Disney characters.  The writers also did a wonderful job of making Lilo a real kid.  She has a good heart, but doesn't always make the best decisions.  She's smart, but troubled. The return to watercolor backgrounds is a complete success.  Disney hasn't done this in over sixty years and this colorful movie, set in Hawaii, is the perfect film on which to bring back the tradition. While I know that there are many options in what to spend your family movie budget on, believe me that this is the only family movie playing that will be a treat for the whole family and not just the kids.

Animated Amelie-Like Perfection,"Smart, warm, and refreshing, Lilo & Stitch makes up for years of Disney mediocrity and then some. I just wish it was an hour longer. All of the characters, from Mr. Bubbles to Stitch himself, are highly compelling and ultimately likable. This is a well-designed film -- both visually and in terms of plot/characters. A triumph for any studio let alone Disney, who really needs a crowd-pleaser right about now.I went in expecting to dislike Lilo & Stitch. I think like most folks, I'm tired of the saccharine, cookie-cutter musicals and the regurgitated plots Disney has spit out over the years. Likewise, the pop-culture-reference laden Shrek and its ""wink-wink, nudge-nudge"" ilk lack an epic feel and are destined to seem 'dated' at some point. And I love a Pixar film as much as the next guy/gal, but all of those entries save the original Toy Story feel somewhat disposable.Lilo & Stitch is the most enchanting film I've seen since Amelie. In some ways, Lilo's eccentricities reminded me of the Amelie character -- Lilo's treasured snapshot collection; her self-made doll; her trip to bring a sandwich to the fish.But it's because of the rich characters that the animation seems so complimentary to the story. This is a welcome departure from 'business as usual,' where the story does nothing but propel snazzy animation.I'd also like to say that I think Disney did itself a disservice by poking fun of its past successes in the Lilo & Stitch trailers. I think they almost took the anti-Disney barbs seen in Shrek TOO seriously. The trailers really turned me off to the film. I was expecting a self-parody in the tradition of (the beat-to-death) Animaniacs -- the type of film that I had no interest in seeing. Lilo & Stitch stands on its own as a classic. I'm so glad I gave it a shot despite Disney's childish, self-referential advertising campaign.",,Anonymous,Animation
One of the Better from this Era of Disney,"This was a movie that came out while I was in high school. By that time, I was no longer watching cartoons, especially Disney. Now a funny story is that I did catch part of this on a movie channel growing up. I figured out that I could make a decent impression of Stitch. Jaime suggested we watch this with Mackenzie to see if it would hold her interest. It did at times, but I was glad to tick this one off the list.We start this on an alien planet. Dr. Jumba (voiced by David Ogden Stiers) is on trial for creating a new species. This is the one that will be known as Stitch (voiced by Chris Sanders). This experiment is sentenced to exile on a deserted asteroid but flees and steals a spaceship. Agent Pleakley (voiced by Kevin McDonald) is sent with the doctor to capture it.Stitch crashes on Earth. To be more specific, Hawaii. It is here that we meet our other title character of Lilo (voiced by Daveigh Chase). She is struggling with fitting in and part of that is her parents have passed away. Her sister, Nani (voiced by Tia Carrere), is doing everything that she can to keep custody. It doesn't help that Cobra Bubbles (voiced by Ving Rhames) is keeping a close eye on her. Nani begs Lilo to stay on her best behavior. It doesn't help when they go to the local pound and Lilo adopts Stitch, thinking he's a dog. This draws the attention of the aliens that are out to bring the experiment back.That should be a good recap and what I'll say is that this movie has good heart. We are getting that classic Disney set up. This is a broken family. Nani is struggling with doing everything that she can to keep her sister. It doesn't help that due to Lilo and Stitch, she loses her job. This makes her case even worse with Children Protective Services. That's complicated even more when the aliens show up and cause mayhem. We see that their house is destroyed and Lilo accidentally gets kidnapped. This is for children, so it has a happy ending. It is also heartwarming and made me tear up as well. I could connect with Lilo and Stitch when it comes to the idea of having a 'pet'. There are also fun reveals that I appreciated.What also helps here is the great voice talent. It always shocks me to learn that Chase, who did the voice for Lilo also was Samara in the American remake of The Ring. She's also the little sister in Donnie Darko. She brings the character to life. It is interesting as well that Sanders is the co-director and co-writer taking on Stitch. That makes me feel like why this works so well since he's a driving force. I like Rhames as this quirky Cobra Bubbles character who has an interesting backstory. Carrere is good as the older sister who is stressed by everything. The rest of the cast rounded this out for what was needed.Let's then finish with filmmaking. I prefer the older style of animation. This is still hand drawn from my understanding so that's a perk in its favor. They seem to just use computers to help speed up the process. This looked great on my 4K television so credit to Disney+. I like what they do here to bring the alien worlds to life and then give us a version of Earth that is a bit different. This feels like it could fall in the world of Men in Black to be honest. This was well-made for sure, as this was a fast watch.I'd recommend giving this a watch if you haven't seen this or it's been a while.

Lilo and Stitch,"My analysis for the movie Lilo and stitch was a very funny and heart warming movie. It taught me that when you aren't looking for something it will always be there. I think that when stitch was all alone and he was looking for someone he is didn't realize that what he was looking for was a family. In the movie there're was a phrase family never gets left behind. I think that it was an extremely sweet when Stitch came back to save Lilo. When I watched this movie I had a lot of laughs, it may or may not seem like a funny movie, but if you watch the movie then you could really learn that family is everything and that they will always be there for you mono matter what. You may learn a different lesson, but the main point that the director is trying to get across, is that family everything. This movie was very funny and I think that the next Lilo and Stitch movie will be even funnier. To sum up what I've said is that the moral part of the movie is that family is every thing and no one gets left behind.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Entertaining, but I was disappointed.","Lovely drawings, sweet message about family, and I liked the fact that the characters were so unlikeable.  Lilo is lonely and aggressive; her sister is frazzled and aggressive; Stitch starts out as destructive and aggressive....you get the idea.  They all bite or hit or punch or kick.  Is this Disney?  By the end, of course, it is. But could they have spent just a little extra time to have the story make sense?  The ugly duckling motif, for example.   They use this as an important theme in the story,  but no one in the story seems to have remembered that the whole point is that the ugly duckling is NOT a duck. And then the CIA wanders in at the end.  What???  Suddenly the social worker (out of the blue) is an agent? ex-agent?  Was at ""Roswell"" in 1973??  How hard would it be to make these bits fit together.  You don't find this kind of slack in the best of Disney animation.  Because it isn't just about the cool graphics or the Elvis music - in the best Disney movies, it's also about a really well-written story.  That's what missing here.",,Anonymous,Animation
Worst Disney flick I've seen in awhile,"The previews and commercials were pretty funny.  The movie was not.  I'm a big Disney fan, but this one bored me to tears.  There were a few cute one-liners, but I don't understand how this could have an 8+ score at this point.The animation was sub-par based on recent Disney movies.  The facial features of the two Hawaiian woman were poorly done in my opinion.  I found them quite unattractive whereas the typical Hawaiian is attractive.I'll take movies like Mulan any day over this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
My favourite movie,"This movie is by far one of Disney's best and it deserves so much more hype that it was ever given. I swear i grew up on this movie and so i am extremely overprotective of it, urging anyone to watch it if they haven't already.The plot was lovely and heart warming all about an outsider finding friendship in another outsider like her. I love this movie and it is definitely one for the entire family, it will warm the hearts of everyoneand come on, a movie must be good if i can have watched it 11+ times (and this is absolutely no joke). If you haven't watched it do yourself a favour and watch it, your life will never be the same though as you will find yourself yearning for a friendship of that of lilo and stitch.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Most Delightfully Odd Disney Family Film to Date,"20 years ago, when Disney Animation Studios was in both a financial and creative rut, a small family dramedy came right out of nowhere and became one of their biggest franchises at the time. Written and directed by Chris Sanders and Dean deBlois, Lilo & Stitch remains a beloved favorite amongst Disney fanatics, critics and new generations alike. While people who grew up with the movie remember all the funny adventures that Hawaiian native Lilo Pelekai and her alien friend Stitch went on, they also come back for the emotional warmth not often tackled in other Disney movies. So how well does the film hold up to date?The film's story focuses on a blue extraterrestrial creature named Experiment 626, who crash lands in Hawaii, gets adopted by a six year-old human girl named Lilo Pelekai and renamed Stitch. Lilo is raised by her older, young adult sister Nani, and Stitch has been genetically engineered to cause chaos and destruction. With these two distinctive world beings set in stone, the movie could easily be a jarring juggling act of tonal clashing. However, because both Lilo and Stitch face obstacles of rejection due to their odd behavior, they end up serving the narrative seamlessly. With Nani struggling to make ends meet while barely being able to look after her own little sister as a guardian, having this weird intergalactic creature come out of nowhere just adds to her stress. Meanwhile, because Stitch was made purely to destroy, being in an already broken family allows him to grow a connection with the socially awkward Elvis obsessed Lilo. In its own quirky way, the movie knows how to blend the sci-fi action with the tender familial warmth through love and loyalty.Adding on to the movie are a cast of delightful characters, both comical and serious. Because the movie successfully draws Lilo and Stitch's two parallel universes together, the supporting cast work well in aiding and going against the titular protagonists. Stitch's creator, Jumba Jookiba, goes from hunting his own experiment down to slowly understanding what Stitch goes through in Hawaii. Beside him is his crossdressing subordinate Pleakley who often has the best laughs from his shocking realization of how dangerous Earth can truly be, on top of having to deal with the impatient Grand Councilwoman. Aiding Lilo and Nani is David Kawena, who proves to be more than a pretty face by being there in the sister's time of need. On the more opposing side is the mysterious social worker Cobra Bubbles, who seems intimidating to Nani at first under pressure, but only wants what's best for the family. Add on the vocal cast giving their A game to their roles, including co-director Chris Sanders as Stitch himself, and you've got a wonderful cast of characters unlike anything else in Disney history.Going into the film's art direction, which was executed through watercolor backdrops, the film represents Hawaii in its natural form to a gorgeous spectacle. On top of the character designs looking authentically built rather than exaggerated, the amount of detail and effort put into so many different aliens gives most sci-fi movies a run for their money. The work of Disney animators Andreas Deja, Alex Kuperschmidt, Stephane Sainte-Foi and many more bring the art style of Sanders to life seamlessly, allowing the film to feel like a children's book brought to life. Also, Alan Silvestri's harmonious breath taking score works well in contrast to the more laid back Hawaiian melodies and the incorporated Elvis songs that establish Lilo and Stitch growing as characters. Never has one movie felt like such a love letter to its own setting and an iconic rock & roll star in just under 90 minutes, nor through so much sincere emotional storytelling.To this day, not only is Lilo & Stitch a remarkable blend of familial drama and alienesque action, but it is one of the most emotionally sincere family films out there thanks to a strong cast of characters, authentically appealing visuals, quirky humor and delightful Hawaiian backdrop. Even after 20 years in the spotlight, it's still worth the time of day for more viewings, so much so that it deserved its long lasting presence in the Disney log line. Regardless if you've grown up with the movie or seen it for the first time now, there's a lot to recommend for all families. After all, family never gets left behind, nor forgotten.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stitch.,"Don't think I have ever watched this movie in full. Only seen bits and just knew about it. Today I watched it and enjoyed it a ton. More than I expected actually, I was afraid it was going to be too much of kids movie but honestly the whole family could enjoy it. It still has emotional overarching themes like loneliness, being outcast, and loss. But with just a bit more levity.I absolutely love the art in this movie, if I'm right all the backgrounds are done in watercolor and it makes this movie visually unique from other Disney movies I've seen so far. It's beautiful, soft and dreamy. The animation is great as well.Time flew by, this movie is over before you know it. Especially if you are enjoying it. Both a good and a bad thing I guess, some more time in that little world wouldn't be too bad.I really love the characters here, the two sisters are fantastic. Stitch is great ofcourse but didnt really have as strong of a emotional grip on me. I don't care too much for the aliens, fine side characters. All in all such a fun and quick movie, with enough twists and turns to keep the pace.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best movies in Disney history.,"Disney made this movie fearing that the animation genre was dying, being replaced with the often more popular CGI genre.  In response to this fear, Disney made a move they have never tried before.  They made a movie that can only be referred to as vulgar, violent and somewhat abusive.  And guess what....  It Works!!!  Disney has finally let go of their attempt to make kid friendly, childish movies which spawned disappointments like Dinosaur, and moved in the direction that Shrek made: lets make a movie that parents can enjoy as much as their children do. The result is one of the funniest, most heart-warming movies in the long line of Disney pictures, one that puts together a perfect blend of comedy, sorrow, and warmth.  This movie is definitely one I'd recommend. I got into this movie with a special screening pass, but I'd more than happily pay to see it again...even at today's ridiculous prices.9/10 if not higher.",,Anonymous,Animation

"One of Disney's greatest efforts; wonderfully animated, effortlessly entertaining and endearingly inclusive.","'Lilo & Stitch (2002)' is a beautifully animated and wonderfully endearing picture that not only shines a light on a culture not often seen in cinema but also makes it - along with its prominent female leads and story of familial acceptance - an integral part of its narrative. This makes the piece an incredibly inclusive experience, in terms of its portrayal and its messages, that makes a point of pointing out the misfit in us all and making the most of the emotional satisfaction that occurs when it finally finds a home. It is easily one of my favourite Disney movies, mainly because of its positive outlook and emotional connectivity. It's also so effortlessly entertaining, funny and charming throughout that a lesser narrative - one that isn't as layered or as effecting as this - might have been forgiven, so long as the fantastic animation and now iconic lead characters were still intact, of course. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Disney Flick In Years,"Atlantis: The Lost Empire sucked. There, I said it. Lilo and Stitch, however, is definitely not in the same ballfield. It sports some great animation ideas (check out those watercolor backgrounds...very 'toon retro), a well-written script with endearing characters, and some very hummable tunes, ranging from classic Elvis to the A*Teens, who I have always enjoyed. Stitch is a fabulous character due to his fuzzy-wuzzy appearance that's matched with his fiery personality. The whole model of San Francisco gag was hilarious, and showed just how offbeat the blue alien is. I also really liked the relationship between Lilo and her older sister Nani. Very believeable and, more importantly, touching. I seriously teared up during this film at times, something that very rarely happens with me. I give L&S 4 out of 4 stars, since it is the best animated film out there right now (with Powerpuff Girls being a late second). Too bad the previews I saw stunk up the joint. Hey Arnold? The Country Bears? Puh-lease! The only one I enjoyed was the visually stunning Treasure Planet. That flick looks fantastic!",,Anonymous,Animation
"Disney's best in a long,long time","It was a fantastic decision for the animators to do watercolor! It really captures the beauty of Hawaiian beaches and its landscape. The characters Lilo and Nani are so REAL, and there are some truly hilarious moments, one of which is the scene where Lilo was on the floor mouthing the lyrics of Heartbreak Hotel while Nani was trying to get into the house. The movie loses some of its ambience towards the end, when the alien leaders reappear, and you are somehow reminded that the producers must have decided to throw in some elements to make the movie more commercial and marketable. Still,I give Lilo and Stitch a rating of 9/10.",,Anonymous,Animation

Awesome!!!,"I can say nothing but good things for this movie! This is possibly one of Disney's best movies ever. The idea of having an antihero was a bold step for Disney, but definitely a brilliant one. Although Stitch may not possess the best qualities, you still fell in love with him and felt for Lilo and Stitch and how hard Lilo tried to change him. I loved the idea of having Lilo be like an outcast. The dialogue and gestures really made you feel during this movie. Most movies that are supposse to be sad just make you feel irritated, and most movies that are funny just make you feel bored, but this movie makes you feel the emotions they are trying to convey. When Lilo is sad, you feel sad. I would give this movie a 10/10!!!!!!",,Anonymous,Animation
All right,I have seen this movie and for a Disney movie this was pretty funny.The movie is about a little hawian girl named Lilo. She is lonely because her parents died in a car crash and she lives with her sister Nani.AND THEY really dont get along. So she tells her she can get a dog then enters Stich a alien from outerspace.And he teaches them and himself about Ohana which means family. Pretty good Disney movie i enjoyed it,,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointment,"This film is about an alien, who is genetically altered to be destructive, finding friendship on Earth.The story is very bad. It is unconvincing and thin. An alien that is antisocial and destructive finds the idea of love appealing? Throughout the film, the characters do things that are not that socially acceptable. For example, in the initial part of the film, the girl locks herself in the house, and refuses to open the door for her sister. She does not open the door even when the sister gives an emotional plea. Another example is the unreasonable behaviour of the girl demanding the adoption of Stitch. In addition, the constantly destructive behaviour of Stitch is glamourised. What kind of message are we sending to kids? I am so disappointed with this film. The story is bad, and the characters are not even likable. I thought Barnyard was bad, but it was at least more entertaining than this.",,Anonymous,Animation
Very Good but,"I love Disney movies but definitely have been very disappointed by the slop the have been putting out (now tell me was putting out The Little Mermaid II really necessary, the preview almost made me throw up, and don't get me started on The Hunchback of Notre Dame II). Lilo and Stitch is very refreshing, and quite entertaining. I think that definitely it should be up for the animation Oscar, but it is still not up to the height that Disney reached in the early '90s. Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast are 2 of my favorite movies of all time, and Lilo just doesn't reach it. It is however better that the low point in the mid '90s (you all remember Hercules). I think that it is a solid Disney movie, quite enjoyable and it did make me cry.",,Anonymous,Animation
Must See (and not for the animation),"I had the chance to watch Ice Age, Monsters, Inc. and Lilo & Stitch all within the space of about 3 days.  My choice:  Lilo and Stitch.This might surprise some who are aware of the reputation of the other two, along with such monster hits as Toy Story and Shrek.  I still think that Lilo and Stitch beats them all.What hit me is the depth of characterization and story.  Lilo is a truly interesting, unique, and complex character;  Stitch is not far behind. In comparison, the characters in the other movies are cardboard cutouts. Somebody on L & S spent some time *writing* instead of thinking up in-jokes and amazing CGI.  It shows.  I identified very closely with both main characters, which really sold me on the entire idea.L & S made me *think*, and *feel*, which any story, any movie really ought to do.In comparison, the other animated movies are cute but not engaging.

I'LL teach them morality and acceptance of others, what family is all about, blah, blah, blah.Nothing new here as far as animation is concerned.

Yeah OK,"With two small children we are always waiting for a good movie. I normally like Disney films but this time we were disappointed. However, before I say anything I should mention the fact that my 5 year old loved the film. This was not the case with my 3 year old as she was very scared by the beginning of the film.I have read the viewer reviews and I note that most people really loved the film. All I can say is that I do not know why. I found the story was forced and uncomfortable. This is a Disney film and seeing a child hide in a washing machine is truly unbelievable considering the danger is such an act. Also children biting was not what we want to see. Is this movie trying to have a bit of Monsters Inc or a little bit of Pokermon as well.I see that some viewers love the return to the old animation as compared to the computer animation. Well I am not one. The works of Pixer is truly fantastic and returning to the old water colour animation is a step backwards.I might sound like I am being a bit unfair but truly I love most Disney films but it has to said when a film does not work.

Disney's most satisfying animated offering to date.,"**** out of ****Shrek, that Dreamworks film about that green ogre, had a wicked sense of humor that must have made an impression on animator Chris Sanders, who peppers his latest film, Lilo and Stitch, with his own brand of quirky humor.  But unlike Shrek, Sanders was also concerned with mixing in realistic human characters and strong, endearing emotions. The result paid off superbly, for everyone, as Lilo and Stitch happens to be one of the best animated films I've ever seen.Experiment 626 is an abomination of nature, a creature whose only function in life is to destroy.  But he escapes his captors by commandeering a spacecraft and crashlands on Earth, specificall Hawaii, where he's befriended by Nani and her younger sister, Lilo, who dubs this newfound pet, Stitch.  With his creator, a mad scientist named Jumba, on the trail, Stitch tries to evade his would-be captors while trying to adopt to his new family, torn between his genetic purpose in life and this warm environment he's been introduced to.With Disney slumming as of late, they've revived themselves the past year with this effort and the underrated Treasure Planet.  Lilo and Stitch offers a little bit of something for everyone: an unbelievably cute ""hero"" in Stitch, believable and engaging human characters, a touching and well-delivered message, and some of the most beautiful traditional, hand-drawn animation I've seen.For nearly an hour, much of Lilo and Stitch's humor is...different, to say the least. I should also mention I haven't laughed so hard during a movie in a long time as I did watching this film.  Stitch, perhaps Disney's most memorable character to date, is a mischievous fellow, but such an adorable one, too, that he wins us over even if he's such a destructive little tyke. The same goes for Lilo, whose initial abrasive attitude is a little disconcerting, but much genuine effort is made to develop her and her older sister into flesh-and-blood characters and it works.The film eventually won me over entirely with its heartfelt of message of the importance of family, which is delivered with surprisingly little sentimentality, a virtual first for the Mouse House company.  And just when you think the movie might lose its edge, the last two minutes deliver a simultaneously hilarious and sweet montage of its characters as the seasons go by.  A terrific end to a fabulous movie.  So please, Mr. Sanders, don't spoil it with a lame sequel.",,Anonymous,Animation
cute flick,"I'm not normally a fan of Disney, but I checked this out for the Elvis tunes...and ended up pleased with the result.  I lived in Hawaii for a spell and laughed out loud at how perfectly they got the dialect, particularly in the truckers trying to figure out what had happened to their truck.  I found the message in line with the general philosophy of Polynesian culture - family pride is huge, not only in Hawaii, but in other Pacific Islands as well.  Good message that fits with a lot of contemporary kids' family situations (despite all obstacles, even though the family is broken, it doesn't mean it's not good).The beginning is sort of dull, but hang on, it gets better.",,Anonymous,Animation
See it,"I bought this film due to my sheer love of Disney movies, I had not seen it in the cinema before hand.

What a wonderful film!,"With all the things people say about ""broken"" homes, it's good to see a film that is not afraid to come out and say ""as long as there is love in the family it's all right."" Lilo and her sister are the ""imperfect"" family and when Stitch comes along it becomes even more imperfect. However, as the movie continues it gives comfort to those children who come from homes like this that it's all right and everything will be okay. Lilo and Stitch seem to be the new attitude of Disney films; crass and strange.  Lilo is a manic girl with an overactive imagination, a far cry from the older, dumbed down fairy tale adaptions of decades past.That's not to say that SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is inferior to this movie, they're just diffrent. I think kids of today, while still in awe of the earlier films, will identify with Lilo and Stitch, two obviously flawed characters, than a perfect woman and a charming young prince. I found this movie to be thorughly entertaining. It had a lot of wonderful humor that most children would not probably get, but enough humor that they would get to make it a great movie experience for them as well a la Shrek Grade:A",,Anonymous,Animation
Great Family movie,"To me this is one of Disney's best if not the best Disney movie ever made. It takes on one of the hardest family situations, children losing their parents and shows just how important family is, while at the same time making an entertaining movie. It balances everything out with smart humor and the fact that this is a sci-fi.Since this is a sci-fi movie so there is no sense in talking about it being believable or plausible. The problems that go on between the two sisters are very believable though, along with the acting out by Lilo at various points during the movie.The cartoon actors are all excellent, and so are their voices.",,Anonymous,Animation
Happily Suprised,"Having just watched this disney movie with my wife and two ten-year-old's, I am happy to say that I was pleasently suprised.

Not Disney's Greatest,"Lilo and Stitch in no regard achieves the level of Disney classics like Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King in my mind, possibly because my nostalgia for childhood overshadows the flaws of those films for me.  On the other hand, it does have a number of funny scenes and the same appealing animation. Furthermore, it marks a departure from the fairy-tale trend in earlier Disney movies to give science fiction a go (some of the ways in which it parodies this genre are pretty intelligent).  Lilo is a good character, if somewhat inconsistent, and Stitch supports a large part of the film with his destructive antics.  The movie as a whole, however, never really knows how to resolve the conflicts within itself.  The transformation of Stitch to family member is contrived and marks an artificial conclusion to the film.  Although David's pidgin and many local stereotypes set the atmosphere for the film, it fails to truly reconcile the oddity of the aliens with the Hawaiian setting; the aliens vacillate between being other-worldly and being human.  Such inconsistencies prevent the viewer from feeling really satisfied with the film in its entirety, and while animation normally makes the willing suspension of disbelief easier, this one pushes it.  However, both Lilo and Stitch are reasonably likeable characters, particularly for children (like my sister), and there are enough clever ideas to make the film worth seeing if you're in the mood.

out of this world,"""Lilo & Stitch"" is a cute and funny movie which has characters not that hard to like.  Not like those traditional Disney animated features where a lot of the characters seemed to have come out of the same blueprint, this features unique characters with adorable personalities. It also shows the traditional Hawaiian way of life clearly as well as entertaining you without being boring or having to resort with musical numbers.The plot? Well, you'd probably think ""Yeah right. Yet another animated version of aliens going to earth..."" But actually, it is not about another ala-""War of the Worlds."" The story is about Lilo (voiced by Daveigh Chase), a lonely little Hawaiian girl who with her older sister Nani (Tia Carrere) have been struggling to stay together since their parents died; and Stitch (Chris Sanders), a pesky little monster from the planet Turo created by mad scientist Jumba Jookiba (David Ogden Stiers), and is programmed for destruction.Stitch, originally called Experiment 626, is sentenced to exile in a distant asteroid, but when the monster escapes to earth, he is adopted as a pet and is named ""Stitch"" by Lilo. From then on, Lilo and Stitch share some hilarious adventures, evading welfare officer Cobra Bubbles and running away from galactic police agents. They soon learn about ""ohana,"" the Hawaiian concept of family which means nobody gets left behind nor forgotten.The animation is simply beautiful, capturing the beauty of Hawaii and the waters surrounding it with the computer animation seamlessly placed in with the hand-drawn segments, while a space pursuit prologue enthralls the audience with action and then consistently amazes with the Hawaiian atmosphere on earth. Plus the comedy is brilliant and not contrived.The downside though is that this movie deals with broken families and how one can recover a new family and it does not present it in the usual Disney way. It has complex issues never seen made so realistically in a Disney movie as when Lilo first meets Stitch, he is a mean, heartless experiment because he has no family. Meanwhile, Lilo and her sister try hard to live together harmoniously and take care of each other as social worker Cobra Bubbles (Ving Rhames) constantly check on them.Usually Disney shows issues too shallow as their target audiences are children who are merely looking to be entertained and don't care on what's going on with the world. And oftentimes, issues are shown metaphorically. But in this one it may be too intense and profound for the younger audiences who have had similar experiences. But at least it has none of the preachy syrupy stuff that ruined good old Disney films the past years.The point is, if you're looking for an excitingly funny and refreshing animated movie, then you won't regret seeing ""Lilo & Stitch.""Grade: A-",,Anonymous,Animation
Ignore the advertising! This is cute!,"The way this film was advertised almost made me miss out on this heartwarming adventure. Far from being a devil in disguise, Stitch is ""cute and fluffy"" but is also full of mischief. That's mischief, not malice. There must have been a miscarriage of justice is all could I think. Lilo matches him because they are both misunderstood. The Elvis/Hawaiian soundtrack is an asset to the film, rather than an annoyance. That is the songs are good, unlike in Tarzan.

IGNORE anyone who doesn't like it! They're outta their mind!,"I just got back from the movie and it was FANTASTIC. I speak as an artist and longtime character-design fan. Stitch alone--his rapid, dangerous-looking movement, the construction of his amazingly expressive and yet pupil-less eyes, the sounds he makes and the effortless way he plows through, rips up and bites things much larger than himself--is worth the price of admission.Some reviewers for fairly major papers (Atlanta Journal-Constitution comes to mind) have chosen to pooh-pooh this movie for no discernible reason. Some whine that the animation was ""dismal"". Earth to them: you have NO idea what you're talking about. Just what *do* you consider good animation? Or that the story was ""derivative"". Excuse me, nothing exists in a vacuum. This movie was WAY more original than 90% of the other movies out there (ummm, wonder if that critic thinks all the old-tv-show-remake movies are great cinema?!). Or that it was ""a kiddie movie that needs Ritalin and a decent script""?! Well, news flash: it's really not a kiddie movie, and this was the only ""kiddie"" script I've seen that dares to give us as a heroine a troubled, lonesome little girl (and her troubled, lonesome ""broken little family"").If you truly enjoy animated films...IGNORE these taste-free, small-minded individuals and enjoy ""Lilo and Stitch"" for its refreshing character designs, beautiful watercolor paintings used as backgrounds, and best of all the cleverly realized, well-rendered movements of the characters. Also, its lack of sappiness, smarminess or gratuitous anything. It's well done across the board--a rare treat that some people, apparently, haven't got the sense to appreciate.",,Anonymous,Animation
