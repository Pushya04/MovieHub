A genuine timeless classic.,"During World War Two the Germans build a new prison camp, Stalag Luft III, for the express purpose of housing many of their most troublesome captured Allied airmen. However, all this serves to do is to pool the resources of some of the most ingenious escape artists in captivity and fill them with a resolve to engineer a mass breakout from the camp.Based largely on real events, this film has assumed classic status over the years and its easy to understand why. Quite simply, it excells in many departments. Director John Sturges was at the height of his creative powers and he keeps a firm grip on the proceedings. Although the film runs close to three hours it never feels sluggish, while at the same time winding up the tension gradually and developing the characters. The production design is first rate, to the point where Donald Pleasance (who had been a P.O.W.) felt quite intimidated by the vast set on his arrival. Daniel Fapp's beautiful photography shows this and the picturesque German locations off to full effect. Put these virtues together with a good script, inspired casting and a classic score by Elmer Bernstein, and you have an object lesson in how to create an intelligent and exciting big budget adventure film.On the subject of the cast; Much is made of Steve McQueen's role. While I am a huge McQueen fan, I feel that some of the other performances are equal to, if not better than his. Richard Attenborough, James Garner, Donald Pleasance, Charles Bronson and Gordon Jackson are all excellent. Good too are James Coburn, James Donald, David McCallum and Hannes Messemer as the sympathetic Commandant.This is one of those films that I can happily watch time and time again. In September of this year a new print was screened at the NFT in London as part of an 'Attenborough at 80' season. It was a pleasure to see this on the big screen at last. For the most part the print was in very good condition. The DVD was one of the first that I ever bought some three and a half years ago, and I watched its inevitable Christmas screening on BBC2 last night. I just never tire of it. In these days of brainless, poorly executed action fodder, its a joy to behold something that hits its targets so precisely.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"If you're going to critique the history, then know the history.","I find it difficult to believe that some reviewers' negative reactions to this film are based on their (misguided) beliefs that none of this could possibly have happened. Comments like these make it crystal clear that what some people don't know about history is appalling. If you are going to judge a film based on historical fact, it helps if you know what it is.It is well-documented what amazing technical feats the POW's were able to accomplish in the stalags. There was even an entire section of the British Secret Service dedicated to coming up with all sorts of clever ways to send these captured men the tools they needed to facilitate their escape attempts, i.e., sandwiching maps between the split sides of a record album (yes, the Germans allowed the prisoners to have records in the camps) or compasses in pens. At Colditz Castle, one of the more forbidding stalags, (actually an offlag since is was for officers only), many, many tunnels were dug and disguises created. One man actually created a German sergeant's uniform totally from scratch, donned a moustache and created an overall impersonation so realistic, it fooled two out of three sets of sentries. Some of the POW's built and concealed an entire glider that would have carried two men off the roof and over the wall! The only reason it didn't fly was because the prison was liberated before they got the chance! The Colditz experience is well documented. There are many books written about that particular prison complete with photographs, including one by a German officer confirming these amazing escapes and attempts. The reviewers who doubt what can be done when necessity is truly the mother of invention should look for them and learn something.As for the prisoners not being in jumpsuits, as suggested by one reviewer as one reason to question the authenticity of the film? Ludicrous, POW's wore what they were captured in. The German military (different from the Gestapo and the SS) considered them soldiers and allowed them to keep their badges of rank.As for the film itself, it is long, but absorbing. There are historical flaws (as there are in all movies), but several of the former POW's participated in the filming process, keeping it, for the most part,  very authentic. As for the emphasis on Americans, it's true they were not among the escapees per se, but several did assist in the effort before they were transferred out, as mentioned by a previous reviewer. However, you must remember that the movie was made for an American audience in 1963, long before international distribution revenue became so important to a studio's bottom line. They needed American stars who would appeal to an American audience. Who knows, perhaps if they were to remake it today, the cast would be all British and German, but I doubt it (see ""Hart's War"" where not only the plot, but all the British and Canadian characters that were in the book, disappeared).All in all, ""The Great Escape"" is an entertaining movie telling a fascinating story of what ordinary men can achieve in adverse circumstances. It's well worth the time.",,Anonymous,History
"Great Escape,Great movie","This must be my favorite movie of all times. Having seen it for the first time,in I guess 1987,a BBC Christmas broadcast,I was captivated by this brilliant piece of work. In the years after,I probably have seen it a ""million"" times,owning it on VHS and DVD,and still watching,whenever it is broadcast,in the original language. Why is it so great? This is a movie that keeps you locked to the screen,because it has everything a great movie should have. A great story,a good length,tension,it is a WW2 movie and the actors give top performances.Not just Steve McQueen,although his performance is brilliant,but also James Garner,James Coburn,Richard Attenborough,Charles Bronson and in this film,one of the greatest roles Donald Pleasance,playing the forger. It isn't historically accurate,please read the book by Paul Brickhill,but that doesn't matter a bit. This film gives you an image of POW camp,the prisoners and their guards,the Germans are also played brilliantly by German actors. I will not repeat the story here,but I can tell you,this film will capture you,all the characters are portrayed brilliantly by the actors. There is excitement,humor,tension,drama and emotion.

Excellent...but the history teacher in me could have hoped for just a bit more...,"I am a tough audience for historical films. As a retired history teacher, I often notice when details are wrong--and I am not the sort of person you'd like to go to such a movie with, as I will invariably complain about the historical license the filmmakers took in regard to the facts. Now I sometimes realize that there are times when changing the facts a bit might not be such a bad thing--but too often, the writers just don't seem to care if they get it right. Because of this, I generally love ""The Great Escape"" as it IS based on a real mass escape and the characters are often based on these actual men. BUT, what I struggle with is the studio's insistence that Americans be included in the cast--though in the actual escape this was NOT the case. What makes it worse is that two of these Americans (Steve McQueen and James Garner) were among the leads in the film--making the event seem like it was planned and executed thanks to the good 'ol USA. Now I love my country, but I love the truth even more and it made me feel bad that the Brits and their Commonwealth members somehow got the short end of this. But, on the other hand, the film does do a very job otherwise when it comes to portraying this period in history.I could review the film at length, but there are countless other reviews on this movie already. The bottom line is that the film has exceptional acting, really fine dialog and is well made throughout--and is clearly one of the best war films can find. Well worth seeing and a film that easily justifies its nearly three hour running time.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Not just great, simply magnificent more like!","""Wait a minute, you aren't seriously suggesting that if I get thru the wire and case everything out there, and don't get picked up, to turn myself in and get thrown in the cooler for a couple of months so you can get the information you need""Smart, witty and directed with adroit hands by John Sturges, The Great Escape is standing the test of time as a joyous multi cast family favourite. Based on the real accounts of allied soldiers escaping en mass from a German POW camp back in 1942, the film is involving from start to finish, due in the main to the wonderful array of characters on show. We follow them from the moment they arrive at the camp right through to the stunning climax, and it is with great joy I say that none of the cast lets the side down, they all do great work for the astute and undervalued Sturges. A number of great set pieces align with Elmer Bernstein's fabulous score to never let the blood settle, and in among the cheeky slices of humour is palpable tension to make this simply one of the best films of its type, in fact one of the best films ever.Sturges and his writers, James Clavell & W.R. Burnett, adapt from the book written by Paul Brickhill, someone who speaks from experience having been one of the prisoners of super POW camp Stalag Luft III, which of course is what The Great Escape is born from. Sturges was fascinated by the story and after trying without fail for over a decade to get it onto the screen, he finally succeeded. The success three years earlier of his star ensemble Western, The Magnificent Seven, enabled Sturges to realise his vision, the result of which is still enthralling new generations with each passing year.The cast is made up of notable thespians and iconic heroes. Steve McQueen (enticing the American audience in one feels), Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, James Donald, Donald Pleasance, James Coburn, James Garner, David McCallum, John Leyton and Gordon Jackson. Which of course is a pretty tidy roll call, but the input and impact of Hannes Messemer as the Camp Commandant, Colonel Von Luger should not be understated. His scenes have a real humanistic quality that shows a softer side of Germany to the one ruled by a certain despot (the finale here offering up the counter opposite of the war), the writers smartly, and rightly, not tarring a nation with the same old brush.A wonderful involving movie that puts characteristic heart in bed with the action and suspense laden plot. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
Absolutely Awesome!!!,"The Great Escape is a classic war movie with plenty happening in it. It just so happens that it is my all time favourite having seen it 60 times since it first was released. Steve McQueen , as Hilts, was the driving force behind this movie. He seemed to tie everything together between the American and British prisoners especially in the scene where they were celebrating the 4th of July with the drums and good ole fashioned American moonshine. The Great Escape contains one of the most famous movie scenes of all times when McQueen has half of the German army chasing after him while riding his motorcycle trying to jump the barb wire fence to get to Switzerland. All in all, The Great Escape had a cast of actors that was so strong that it was a wonder they got this movie made in the first place with all of the egos involved. James Garner, Charles Bronson, Angus Lennie, James Coburn, etc.were absolutely awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Great Movie,"The Germans, ""with madness in their method"" have taken every captured flier who has made repeated attempts to escape and put them in a POW camp which they have devised to be inescapable. Under the supervision of Richard Attenborough, they immediately begin to dig tunnels to break out 250 men.There are anhistorical elements here. There were four tunnels dug, not the three in the movie; the date of the escape was changed; most notably, several American flyers took part in the breakout. While Americans did take part in the planning and construction, they had been moved to a different camp by the time of the event. This was an American film, and director John Sturges had been trying to get this project off the ground for the better part of a decade before he and the Mirisches got United Artists to foot the bill, so James Garner, Steve McQueen, and Charles Bronson (as a Pole) got major roles. UA also wanted a shorter running time, and some women, which Sturges was able to resist.It's a great, gripping blend of suspense and thrills, with some pawky humor thrown in, and a canny shift in camerawork. The first two-thirds, with its closed-in spaces sustains an element of oppression, culminating with the breakout, at night in the confined space of the tunnel. This is followed by brightly lit and open vistas as the escapees make their ways towards freedom. Because Sturges had directed THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, the remake of Kurosawa's THE SEVEN SAMURAI, I thought for many years this dichotomy was taken from Kurosawa's HIGH AND LOW. However, the latter picture was released four months after Sturges'.170 minutes is a very long time for a feature film, and this was undoubtedly released in a road show version with an intermission. The natural place for a break would be right after the Germans discover the primary tunnel. Nowadays, when I watch this, I can take a break whenever I like. Even knowing how it comes out, it's a struggle to stop the movie at any point.",10.0,Anonymous,History

30 TO ZERO in the 9th INNING.,"When we first saw this movie in 1963 at Washington DC's RKO KEITH'S THEATRE, all 1,850 seats were filled and there were several hundred standees, no doubt in violation of the fire codes. I've never seen such a full movie-house. I was fully taken in by the star studded cast, the patriotic true story, the starring score by Elmer Bernstein, and the wonderful cinematography of the European landscape. I could not understand the Luke-warm reviews in Washington's four newspapers. 43 years later I can see the reviewers were right. This was a mediocre movie designed simply as a popular entertainment.Where John Sturges and James Clavel went wrong was stacking the deck so totally in favor of the American prisoners and against their German captors, the film has all the suspense of a 30 to zero ball game. While the Americans plot and execute the escape, at no time do the Germans lift a finger to prevent it. Everything goes smoothly according to plan. Anything and everything the prisoners need is simply found with no great effort amongst the prison grounds. How silly! Even when the Germans stumble upon the tunnel entrance under the stove, their only reaction is to look down the hole. No disciplinary action follows, not even yelling.In 1963, Hollywood hadn't yet learned to hate America. This was NOT a rotten revisionist history travesty such as Jerry Bruckheimer's PEARL HARBOR or Steven Spielberg's PRIVATE RYAN. The filmmaker's hearts were in the right place. But the 50 men to whom the film is dedicated truly were deserving of a good film being made in their honor. More a kid-flick than a serious drama, this picture does not deserve inclusion in the top 250 --- or 2,000.",6.0,Anonymous,History
GREAT MOVIE: MORE HISTORICALLY ACCURATE THAN SOME REALIZE...,"This is a great movie which much more historically accurate than it is often given credit for. So many who say otherwise are ill-informed and obviously don't know much about the actual history of that actual escape. The depiction of what happened to the recaptured prisoners in the movie of THE GREAT ESCAPE is reasonably accurate as detailed on the historyinfilm site...specifically on the ""Reprisal"" page; along with being detailed in the various published accounts.Hitler ultimately calmed down after being reasoned with by Goering, Feldmarschall Keitel, Maj-Gen Graevenitz and Maj-Gen Westhoff, and dictated that more than half the prisoners be shot and cremated. So, as depicted in the film, several of those recaptured were not executed and were indeed returned to confinement. In fact, even those executed were not ""shot on the spot"" for the most part, but were actually executed later after being turned over to the Gestapo; most being shot while being allowed to relieve themselves, under the guise of ""trying to escape"".Furthermore, there are many accounts as to how much more humane the environment was within the camp (which even had a popular and very successful theatre, featuring prisoners who would later be name performers) than many other POW camps...and certainly nothing like the harsh conditions associated with the Concentration or Extermination camps.To quote one source:""It must be made clear that the German Luftwaffe [the German Air Force], who were responsible for Air Force prisoners of war, maintained a degree of professional respect for fellow flyers, and the general attitude of the camp security officers and guards should not be confused with the SS or Gestapo. The Luftwaffe treated the POWs well, despite an erratic and inconsistent supply of food.Prisoners were handled quite fairly within the Geneva Convention, and the Kommandant, Oberst (Colonel) Friedrich-Wilhelm von Lindeiner-Wildau, was a professional and honourable soldier who won the respect of the senior prisoners.""Finally, virtually all the major engineering aspects in regards to the tunnels and the initial escape in the film are as they were actually acheived in the real escape.It would behoove some to learn a little more actual history or do a little simple research before shooting from the hip with supposed ""knowledge"" of reality. THE GREAT ESCAPE certainly takes liberties in tone and character portrayal, but not in the key elements that are disparaged out of sneering ignorance.BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI is also a great film, but took even greater liberties with the technical details of the events described than THE GREAT ESCAPE did....and offering up VON RYAN'S EXPRESS as a more realistic alternative is simply delusional and ridiculous.",,Anonymous,History
A Great Escape,"I saw this movie for the first time as a nine year old boy on a big screen in the Bronx.  I'm now in my 40's.  I have seen it many times since but not on the big screen.

These men are all near saints; James Garner insisting on Donald Plesence making the escape, Charles Bronson fighting his claustrophobia.

The continuous escapes have caused the Nazi staff ordered 'putting all the rotten eggs in one basket' as the prisoners are reunited into a special concentration camp . It deals with hard preparatives of a diverse group formed by rebel air officers and soldiers mounting a dangerous getaway from a barbed-wired and strongly controlled camp . The most part of the film concerns on the elaborated process of secretly digging an underground tunnel and the last one deals with spectacular breakout and effort the approx. 70 escaped prisoners throughout Germany trying to make their bid to freedom , including an impressive motorcycle pursuit in charge of iconic Steve McQueen for one of the best action sequences in years .This exciting story contains thrills, intrigue, tension, excitement galore, entertainment and lots of fun . Suspenseful WWII epic packs exceptional plethora of prestigious actors incarnating the motley group of POWs , giving good acting and support , as a sensational Steve McQueen whose character , ¨The Cooler King¨ , remains today as attractive iconography ; Charles Bronson as digging expert but suffering claustrophobia ; Donald Pleasance as professional on forge documents but blind , James Coburn as roguish Australian and of course Richard Attenborough as Air Force Squadron leader who plans the massive breakout , furthermore , James Garner as American officer , the British Gordon Jackson and David McCallum, among others .

Overrated But Entertaining American Movie,"This came third in Channel 4's recent 100 GREATEST WAR MOVIES poll a few months ago which did rather surprise me since I've always found it somewhat overrated but it does remain a fairly entertaining American movieYes THE GREAT ESCAPE is an American movie and I'm glad that the IMDb classes it so . It's directed by an American , is produced and financed by an American studio and most ironic of all the theme tune that is adopted and chanted by English football fans was written by the American composer Elmer Bernstien . It may contain many British actors but notice also the likes of Garner , Bronson and Coburn playing British Commonwealth characters which is down to what's known as "" Audience identification "" ie if a movie is made with American money the Yanks want their movie to do well in America hence nearly every "" British "" movie you see has a major character played by an American actorAs for the story itself everyone has seen the movie ( We in Britain get to see it almost once a year usually at Xmas ) so I won't linger on it too long except to say it comes in what can only be described as two parts . The first part centres on the build up of the escape with the movie's tongue firmly in its cheek ( Werner the stupid German , man jumps on bunk and it collapses etc ) with the prisoners on the run making up the second part of the story which is more serious in tone . Also watch out for the ironic scene early in the film where a character chastises someone for replying in English to a question in German as the escapees plan their escape with the character later on making the same mistake himself .

Silly Hollywood fluff,"A silly, silly movie. I rented it based upon the rave reviews on this site, and only sat through until the end so I could add my own review. I love war movies, but this thing was a combination of ""Hogan's Heroes"" and ""Gilligan's Island"". I should have known by the goofy little theme song in the beginning that it was just a piece of Hollywood fluff, circa 1963. I find it truly hard to believe that others have rated it highly.My main problem with the film is that everybody and everything is a Hollywood cliche or stereotype. The camp guards spend the movie ignorantly staring into space while the escape plan magically develops before them, and the Commandant is downright sympathetic to the plight of his prisoners. And why were they trying to escape, anyways? I lost track of the number of scenes showing clean, healthy, well fed, well groomed ""prisoners"" sitting around smoking pipes in their sweaters, fer cryin' out loud! And the camp itself looked like an upscale hunting lodge during a comfortable summer. Imagine a 3 hour Nazi prison movie without one single unpleasant scene! This movie is nothing less than an insult to anyone that managed to survive a Nazi camp, and the millions that didn't.  Heck, I look worse after a good night's sleep than these ""prisoners"" did after 20 days in solitary. I always wondered where the idea came from to make a TV sit-com about a WWII German P.O.W. camp (Hogan's Heroes). After seeing this completely unbelievable waste of time I now know.  If you want a good WWII movie rent ""Patton"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"". This thing is just a bad comedy. I would give it a ""3"" out of ""10"".

One of the all time great war movies,"I cannot dislike The Great Escape, with its great cast, anthem-like music score and of course its attention to detail. The film is brilliantly shot with beautiful cinematography, and of course the music score is great, very iconic. It may be a little annoying to some people, as the theme is repeated over and over again, but there is something triumphant about it so I find it hard not to like it. The script is great, but it is the cast and the attention to detail that sticks in the mind. This escape yarn has everything from collapsing tunnels, probing searchlights to the classic movie image of Hilts attempting to escape to freedom on a motorbike. And then there are the characters, for example we have Donald Pleasence's timid forger, James Garner's smooth-talking scrounger and most obviously Steve McQueen's super cool Captain Virgil Hilts. Garner, Pleasence, James Coburn, Richard Attenborough and Charles Bronson fit their parts perfectly, but for me it is McQueen's movie. Overall, The Great Escape is quite simply great, one of the all time great war movies. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Still fantastic stuff, almost 60 years later","Such a classic. It's been over 10 years since I first watched this, and returning to it tonight, I think I liked it even more.You could argue this is THE prison escape movie. Even if it's not the best prison movie ever, the fact that it's almost 100% about setting up and executing the escape for almost three hours means it's hard to imagine something with a similar premise being much better.It's well-paced for its length, and it's a good sign that all the set-up is just as good as the pay-offs in the second half. You could argue the last hour drags a little, but it also contains many of the film's most memorable scenes (yes I know the movie's nearly 60 years old, but I'm still going to be vague in case anyone who reads this hasn't seen it 😅)Goes without saying but Steve McQueen is incredibly cool, but it's a testament to how great the rest of the cast is that McQueen's character can spend so much time in solitary confinement and the movie still moves well and entertains without him.Closest thing to a flaw, if I had to pick one? Prison looks almost a little too fun here because of how likeable the characters are. They're all cool and funny, and in a way, that makes this prison camp look less hellish than it could be. I definitely understand why they want to escape, but it doesn't capture the horrors of prison life as much as other prison movies.That being said, there are a few heavy scenes in the movie that do serve as reminders of how terrible the war was as a whole, and how ruthless the German army could be. So the atmosphere being relaxed at times in the first half is a pretty minor complaint.So: great acting, great pacing, great music, exciting scenes, and plenty of suspense... it all adds up to a great time, and it's aged brilliantly for a movie of its age. It stands as both an essential WW2 film and an essential prison movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"All in all, a WW2 epic.","The Great Escape is definitely one of my favorite movies. I remember seeing it at the drive-in when I was about 6. My parents always brought me a blanket so I could sleep in the back seat, but I stayed up for this one. The cast is excellent, with many memorable characters. Steve McQueen is at his peak, along with James Garner and Richard Attenborough. Based on a true story, a group of POWs from many allied nations plan a daring tunnel escape from a German camp. We see them plan, prepare, and dig the tunnels (3) as they elude detection from their captors. I have only one issue; the conditions of the camp are presented as a little too pristine, not dirty or squalid as in other POW movies like Stalag 17 or Von Ryan's Express. The prisoners here are always well fed and well groomed, with cleaned and pressed uniforms. But that can be overlooked because overall, the movie is excellent. The actual escape is filled with suspense, and the last hour of the movie we see them on the run, by plane, train, on foot, and in McQueen's case, by motorcycle.

Great movie!,"This movie could easily make my top 15 of all time.  From what I have read, it was QUITE realistic.  Several of the British officers that were actually there went to the site in Germany when it was filmed.  When something was wrong, they spoke up and got it fixed. (This has been on the History Channel several times.) There were almost no Americans, if any, at the time of escape.  They had been moved to another camp only a couple of weeks prior to the escape. Many of the prime characters were based on actual people, most notably Attenborough. I also read the book (about 30 years ago) in high school pm which the movie was based.  They had photos the Germans took of the tunnels. The movie was incredibly accurate. The tracks, the air pumps, lights, etc. It isn't the movie that was amazing, it was what the prisoners did. As far as how the prisoners were treated, for the most part, relatively well.  The death rate in a German POW camp was about 1-2%.  In a Japanese prison camp, about 35% of the Allied prisoners died, due to murder, torture, disease, starvation, etc.  The Luftwaffe, headed by Fatso Goering, guarded Allied airman because Goering had a weird sense of camaraderie with fellow flyers.  The Gestapo or SS are the ones who shot the 50 prisoners.  These war criminals were later faced war crimes trials. This is one hell of a movie. But find the book yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Beginning of an era,"I've been meaning to watch ""The great escape"" for a very long time but just couldn't lay my hands on it for some reason - the fact that I've heard so much about this movie and how culturally significant it is to the world of cinema, prevented me from watching it, in fear that I wouldn't like it as much as the rest of the world. So the time has come and I did watch it.
Begins very slow and builds up for the most part for ""the great escape"" itself this is really a waste of a movie: almost non of the characters have a true indentity, a simple background story, even the main characters don't have a decent amount of dialogues - they are simply put there to dig, do the things they are ought to do. I've expected more from a high calibre actors like Steve McQueen or James Garner (whose performances are great by the way) but they all wear the same faces in the movie. The music is good though and even though it doesn't exactly fit to the plot and the place it is set at it makes it all the while a pleasant watch. With ""The great escape"" I'd say the era of so called blockbusters have began when the plot stopped playing the fiddle and the couple of big names thrown can make a difference in the pockets of those who had done the movie. Overall a good picture but nothing more and nothing in between to make it a great one.",7.0,Anonymous,History
No great escape.,"THE GREAT ESCAPE is another overrated ""classic"" that somehow seems to stumble along film history on its good reputation. Very little about it is great, as the title suggests, and so one sits through 170+ minutes only partly enjoying the company of POWs in a Nazi camp. A Nazi camp however that's pretty far removed from anything I've imagined, heard or read about German Concentration Camps during WWII, as the film portrays it as quite a relaxed and sunny condition. The characters we're in it for are a bunch of guys that tods along happily enough aiming to escape, and while there are several neat moments among them, one character seems unclear; Steve McQueen's Captain Hilts, if not a weird character, certainly an annoying performance by McQueen. Through the hours of planing the escape, the jovial and cheerful mood of the film helped me get through it, and as we're headed out at the end I felt disappointed, as the supposed great climax is somehow disjointed and lackluster.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Nothing special,"This movie was probably a big deal when it came out. But by today's standards it is too long and boring. I got bored almost immediately when watching it, and so I fast-forwarded through the first hour and 45 minutes. I genuinely felt like I missed absolutely nothing except a bunch of pointless scenes in the POW camp. The last hour is where everything seems to happen, and even that is somewhat slow-paced. Basically, I think this film has mostly outlived its value.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Outstanding Entertainment,"Credit should be given to the brilliant score by Elmer Bernstein. If you listen to it closely, it literally is a battle between the Allied Prisoners (flutes & woodwinds) and the Germans (tubas).  The escape scenes with the little boat on the scenic german river is evocative of Wagner and his heroic Germanic Operas.  The scenery of the German countryside and the Alps is breathtaking.  I believe that the scriptwriters emphasized the heroism, humor, and character of the prisoners to make an uplifting statement of what is essentially a cruel and tragic story.  As a child growing up in the seventies, our 7th grade glass was reading the Paul Brickhill book and we had the opportunity to meet a former (American) Stalag Luft III prisoner from that era.  He had arrived at the camp after the Great Escape, but was placed on the monument detail for the 50 executed men. He said that few men seriously contemplated escape after this incident and the emphasis was on surviving the war and going home alive.",,Anonymous,History
Great epic movie,"This movie is based on a true story about a group of mostly British soldiers with a few people from other nationalities who are brought in a super secure German prison for prisoners of war during WWII. Many of them have been trying to escape from several prisons several times, and therefore the German military decides to keep them all together in that facility. The first part of the movie is about the planification of the escape while the second part is the execution of the escape. The movie includes a great cast such as Steve McQueen, James Gardner, and Charles Bronson.While this ends up as a heartbreaking story, the characters are determined, resilient, smart, and optimistic while facing horrible circumstances. I think the director and the actors did a great job at honoring the real POWs. The music and sometimes the scenes feel very light, which almost makes you feel like you are watching an episode of ""Hogan's Heroes"". However the director is quick at bringing you back to the seriousness of the situation by showing you the terrible consequences faced by the POWs for their actions.The landscape was beautiful. When McQueen while riding his stolen bike stop to look at where he is. You can see a chain of mountains in the horizon that just looks stunning. All in all a great epic movie with an amazing cast.",8.0,Anonymous,History
One of the best pictures of 1963,"When I finally got around to watching this classic, I remember jokingly rolling my eyes at my mom. ""How can this movie be exciting?"" I asked. ""Obviously, they get away with it, otherwise the movie would have been called The Great Failure."" And, clocking in at nearly three hours, I thought I'd be bored to tears. The last laugh's on me, since it turned out to be a very exciting three hours.What is perhaps the most charming aspect of the film (even more so than Elmer Bernstein's American version of ""Colonel Bogey March"") is the screenplay's connection to the actors. Charles Bronson's character was Russian, worked in a coalmine as a child, and suffered from claustrophobia; all taken from his own background. Donald Pleasance was captured, tortured, and held in a German prison camp during WWII. In the Korean War, James Garner was a ""scrounger"" and found hard-to-get items for a price; his character in the film was built around his real-life experience. Screenwriters James Clavell and W. R. Burnett added in realism that built on the tension in the plot and the camaraderie between the actors.As entertaining, thrilling, and interesting as the film's journey was, I did have one little criticism. My criticism of the movie was the lack of time period authenticity. The hairstyles and fashions belonged in 1963, not in the mid-1940s. There was also a healthy dose of Stalag 17 injected into this movie, glamorizing enemy war camps. Everyone's hair looked clean, no one had to grow a mangy beard, become malnourished, or suffer from drinking contaminated water. At times, it seemed like Richard Attenborough orchestrated an escape plan simply for entertainment, rather than because the prisoners were treated intolerably.However, it seems like a small price to pay for such a classic movie. There's a terrific cast, and everyone looks like they're having a blast during filming. It truly is one of the best pictures of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Film Has Slowed With Age, But Still Merits Praise","Although I still like this film - and proudly own it on disc - I have to admit it was a disappointment seeing it after a long period of time had elapsed between viewings. When I saw this in the theater in 1963, I thought it was spectacular. Later, when it came out on VHS, I thought thought it was good but the longer the years go by, the slower this film gets and it doesn't have the hold on me it once did. Part of that is that movies are faster- moving nowadays.It just takes too long (two hours!) before the ""great escape"" finally takes place! I loved the last 50 minutes. That, still, was fascinating as much as it ever was, even though it's never been a happy one. It's still good stuff.The first two hours of this 172-minute movie turn out to be more of characterizations that anything else, although it details what went into making the escape from this German prison camp possible. Some of that is interesting, such as Chales Bronson's claustrophobia and Donald Pleasance's eyesight deterioration, etc.With stars like Steve McQueen, James Garner, James Coburn, Richard Attenborough, Bronson, Pleasance and James Donald you will get some characters you'll remember for a long time: especially, I found, McQueen's and Bronson's.Now that it is out on a special two-disc DVD which gives it a decent picture (there was an earlier DVD that wasn't much better than the VHS) and some features, it should climb back up the ladder on my rating of it. Regardless, this will always be considered on the best of the World War II movies.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Greatest Film Of All Time!,"This is, in my opinion, the greatest film ever made! Made in 1963, this true story begins with the arrival of Allied P.O.W.'s to Stalag Luft III. They are told that there will be no escapes from this camp by the German officers, but they have made one mistake. They have literally, put all known escapees together 'in one basket' and they set about to do what they do best - ESCAPE! The scenes throughout the film are thrilling, especially the chase scene with Steve McQueen at the end of the film.Miss it at your peril.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Wonderful,"There are few adventure stories as great as this. The movie never flags - it uses its wonderfully large cast to perfect effect - everyone will have his favorite characters - the colors, the music, the sense of a wonderful adventure is just magnetic.It is interesting to think of how VERY different this movie could have been in different screenwriters and directors' hands. It is easy to imagine a very dark movie about an escape plan for 250 spoiled so that it involved only 76, and of the 76, 60 massacred and only a very few escaping - a story of frustration, of man's hopes destroyed, of the darkness of life. It would be interesting to see such a version - perhaps something like The Piano or Schindler's List.Instead somehow, the movie makes the viewer feel GREAT - vibrant, happy, enthusiastic, excited! It's remarkable that this story could be made to do this - I think much is due to the energy of a large group working with such dedication and teamwork, much is due to the wonderful music, much is due to the very attractiveness of the actors themselves.For me, there is something terribly appealing about the David McCallum character, Ashley-Pitt - his sacrifice to save the leader (and thus the entire operation), his looks, his manner. And something very touching about the Garner-Pleasance characters operating in tandem. Attenborough is himself properly subdued, authoritative, commanding - and Jackson is an excellent sidekick.I've always liked James Donald very much in everything - particularly as the conscience of The Bridge on the river Kwai - he's in the same form here.If you have heard the term, the ""Anglosphere"" in recent years, one can see a vivid illustration of it here - the Australian-American-English-Scottish team working perfectly - with the same sense of values to be pursued and preserved, the same sense of humor, dedication.This is just wonderful for anyone - but perhaps particularly for men since there aren't any women in it at all!",9.0,Anonymous,History

A classic moment for the stars,"Apart from the fact that it was a unique and great adventure epic, The Great Escape made important contributions to the career of a number of American and British male stars and would-be stars.   This was due in part to director/producer John Sturges' particular intuition for the choice of actors and to effective, well-balanced characterizations which served as vehicles to several their players.  Interestingly, none of the film's performers were big stars at the time and only McQueen, Garner and Attenbourough were well-known leading men.  Primarily, the movie of course launched Steve McQueen to major stardom, only a few years after Sturges' The Magnificent Seven established the actor's lone hero persona on the big screen.  McQueen stands out as a daring and cynical individualist, who appears unmoved and downright impertinent when being thrown in and out of the prison camp's cooler, and culminates in a classic motorcycle chase. But in a somewhat less glamorous manner, James Garner arguably gives a superior performance as the ""scrounger"", the prisoner gathering most of the essential materials of the escape through his wit, relaxed charm and resourcefulness. McQueen's admittedly impressive characterization sometimes comes a bit too close to parody and spectacular heroics, in the end lacking some credibility.  Garner, on the other hand, manages a more subtle, understated humour, not distracting from the seriousness of his work and the stakes involved in the escape.  Meanwhile, Richard Attenborough is also excellent as the mastermind of the escape, forcefully portraying a man convinced of his mission and ready to make sacrifices and ruthless decisions to achieve it.  From the rest of the cast, Charles Bronson probably stands out most, projecting strength and determination as the head of the tunnel diggers, while towards the end, effectively conveying a vulnerable, tortured side of his character (even though the fact that the ""Tunnel King"" turns out to be a closet claustrophobic stretches credibility somewhat).  Donald Pleasance gives some outstanding pieces of acting when his character gradually turns blind before the escape.  The evolution of his friendship with Garner provides an interesting plot and character development, as Pleasance's traditional British ways and habits contrasts amusingly with Garner's easy-going and open American style.  James Donald also does very well as the senior British officer, providing thoughtful, sensitive and self-effacing leadership.  The other protagonists do not have sufficient screen time to make their characters more than moderately interesting, but  James Coburn shines as a brash Australian who ends up escaping on a stolen bicycle, David McCallum has some brief but noticeable moments, particularly when disguised as a German civilian during his escape, and Gordon Jackson gives some bright support to Attenbourough, providing a human touch to balance the excessive seriousness of the latter's character.  The attention spent to the fate and personality traits of all these characters, enliven by the engaging and usually flawless acting of the players, had much to do in creating and maintaining the interest of The Great Escape, making it a lot more than a big and exciting action film.  For McQueen, Garner, Attenborough, Bronson, Coburn, Pleasance and McCallum, The Great Escape represents some of the finest moments in their long illustrious careers.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Smacks of Cheesy, Americanistic Exceptionalism","Starring Steve McQueen, James Garner, etc. Hollywood's version of an actual escape from a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp for officers. In actual fact, none of the 76 escapees were American. 50 were shot, and only 3 actually escaped. No motorcycles or airplanes were used in the actual escape attempts.

The Great Escape lacks emotion and intensity,"The Great Escape is the type of movie where people from different generations will have wide variation of opinions. People from the so-called ""greatest generation"" who lived through WWII and may have served in the ""war to end all wars"" like my grandfather, will probably enjoy this movie. It's good vs. evil in a world where that seemed so evident in life. Allied vs. Axis and the Nazis vs. freedom. This group of airmen will doing anything to escape the clutches of the evil Nazis who are holding them captive.However, the major problem with the movie is that the Nazis don't seem so evil, cruel or stern. There is lack of fear or even concern for the characters because this group of Nazis are wellnice and well-mannered to a fault. You feel like it is a game to everyone involved. The airmen try to escape and they are playfully sent away to the ""cooler"" with a smile and mild scolding. The next attempts result in the same punishment this time without the smile. Nobody is threatened with a firing squad or sent away to hard labor. The Nazis seem to encourage escape attempts.Having seen recent movies like Schindler's List, Max Manus and Sophie Scholl; the Nazis in these movies aren't so forgiving of war-time transgressions. It just rings false in this movie especially for someone in my generation (genX) or younger. This leads to a lack of intensity or involvement in the movie when you know the characters face little to no consequences for their actions.It doesn't completely ruin the movie because the final third of the movie has some real reasons to finally become involved in the characters because bullets actually start to fly and some characters actually have to fight the enemy. Still the action is stilted and hollow because of the lack of film making expertise and technology, so you don't feel the emotion that you should based on the fatal incidents.The Great Escape has some fun moments with good actors like a young Steve McQueen, James Garner and a less grizzled, almost gentle Charles Bronson. It was enjoyable to see them before they became really famous movie stars. However, this movie doesn't deserve the universal praise that it received from film critics and viewers. If you want to see Steve McQueen in a motorcycle chase this movie is for you. If you want to see an intense prison break during WWII—don't bother with this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Escape and the Cooler King,"Back in 1963, a war film arrived on the silver screen which set the standard for all dramas which followed. True there were other great war films such as The War Lover and Twelve O'Clock High, but none of them became the launching point for so many of Hollywood's great screen stars. Paul Brickhill wrote the original true story upon which this film is based on. Furthermore, with Elmer Berstein's rousing musical score, this movie then becomes nothing short of genuine classic. The saga of ""The Great Escape"" is wound around the actual war time experiences of American and British Airmen, who'd been captured and sent to what the German High Command called 'An Escape proof' prisoner of War Camp. Upon seeing the assortment of Hollywood elite, one can not expect anything but great drama and action adventure from the entire cast. Steve McQueen, who plays Capt. Virgil Hilts, ""The Cooler King"" leads an all star line up which consists of James Garner as Hendley ""The Scrounger"", Richard Attenborough as Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett, James Donald as Group Capt. Ramsey ""The Senior British Officer"", Charles Bronson is memorable as Danny Velinski ""The Tunnel King"", Donald Pleasence as Blythe, James Coburn as Louis Sedgwick, David McCallum as Ashley-Pitt and Gordon Jackson as MacDonald. They are imprisoned and guarded by Germany's elite guards, commanded by Col. Von Luger (Hannes Messemer) who has been personally selected for the task.

An All-Time Classic,"One of the all-time great films, ""The Great Escape"" is simply flawless and unforgettable.

Missing information,"I'll start this review by saying I am admittedly not the generation that most likely gave the initial ratings and reviews on this classic. I watched this for the first time right after I watched the PBS Nova documentary where the actual survivors spoke.The 2 biggest issues I had with this movie was the lack of any dates or locations, nor any references to the Geneva convention from 1929 explaining why the rules in this war prison were so relaxed, compared to not just other prisons/camps in germany, but what american prisoners had to endure in Japanese war prisons.This movie essentially presents escaping from a german prison as a bit of a comedy. Which isn't necessarily inaccurate, but what's missing is the explanation. The score only further makes it seem as a comedy, as escaping from these prisons didn't necessarily mean getting shot, so escaping seems to be a joke with only 10 days in solitude as a punishment.Meanwhile one wonders how this can be the case with Germany's dealing with war crimes everywhere else, yet here it's somehow adhering to an agreement 10 years before the war broke out with 0 explanations on why.The other thing that was not explained at all, was the prison guards somehow being run by both german AND british commanders. I may need to look this up further, but it just made no sense without the movie touching on this at all.Obviously understand storytelling used to be a bit different in the 60s, but I just feel like they left out too much context on top of the inaccuracies, like there not being any actual americans there for this to deserve the very high rating.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Not great by a long shot!,"I can really only reiterate what others have said about this over-rated, over-long film. The tone and atmosphere seem off from the start as the prisoners arrive, swagger about and case the POW camp like they own the place and ultimately they do. It seems more like a summer camp; everything looks too bright and clean including the prisoners who never have a hair out of place. The film is about as persuasive as Hogan's Heroes and arguably less entertaining. There is no real suspense or tension until the end and the film and characters have no depth. In no way does this film compare to Stalag 17 (1953) or The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957). At 3 hours long, I found the film tedious and talky.",2.0,Anonymous,History

"Exciting, well-acted prisoner-of-war epic is a treat for movie fans.","""The Great Escape"" stands out as one of the greatest war films.  It would be inaccurate to characterize it as a prisoner-of-war film.  It doesn't compare to ""Stalag 17"" in its depiction of barracks life in the prison camps.  For one thing, ""The Great Escape"" was filmed in glorious technicolor with the Alps and forests of Germany as a backdrop.  Much of the film occurs outside. ""Stalag 17"", by contrast, is filmed in gritty black and white with the mud of a German winter in the background.  Virtually the entire film occurs indoors.  For a realistic portrayal of what life in a German prison camp might have been like watch ""Stalag 17"".""The Great Escape"" is primarily an action film.  The prison camp is merely a launching point for the movie's action, which features a tunnel cave-in, furious chases through picturesque German villages, leaps from a speeding train and a plane crash.  Steve McQueen's stunt riding on a bicycle provides some of the greatest moments in any film and is every bit as exciting as the famous car chase in his film ""Bullit"".The international cast does a grand job of acting.  The characterizations are rich.  The viewer cannot help but identify with these characters.  The character of ""Big X"" played by Richard Attenborough is complex.  He reminds me of a prize fighter who has had one fight to many.  In this case he has been in the ring with the Gestapo, and it shows.  Hendley played by James Garner is the scrounger.  He is the person the prisoners go to when they need travel documents, a camera or tunnel digging tools.  He is a cynic.  At the end of the film he asks ""Was it worth it?""There is plenty of suspense in this film.  Which ones will escape?  You pick your favorites and hope they make it.  Some do.  Some don't.  There is disappointment when Steve McQueen's motorcycle wipes out within a few feet of the Swiss border and freedom.  There is a feeling of elation when James Coburn's guide appears and points at the mountains in the distance with the one word line ""Espana"".Light moments are few in this film.  The Fourth of July celebration complete with prison camp moonshine is an initial success, but disaster intrudes on the fun.  The guards find one of the tunnels, and a prisoner is shot while trying to escape.The film has a very human quality to it. The prisoners have very human faults.  The obsession of ""Big X"" with getting back at the Germans for torturing him is an example.  Charles Bronson's character is a genius at building tunnels but is a claustrophobic.The Germans are not depicted as uniformly evil.  The prison camp commandant (played by Hannes Messemer) is a compassionate man.  He is quite a contrast to Otto Preminger's commandant in ""Stalag 17"".  Robert Graf's character, ""Werner, the Ferret"", is a mixed up but generally sincere and kind person. He and Garner share a few moments of friendship in the film.  It is Garner who violates the code to lift Werner's wallet to provide the documents that the prisoners need.  The Gestapo is portrayed as evil and sadistic.  In the film's early moments one of their men threatens ""X"" that ""if you fall into our hands again, you will not be so lucky.""  Later, he makes good on that threat.This is a memorable film that works on many levels.  Few war films have had such a blend of great acting, beautiful scenery and exciting action. Interestingly, there is little of the graphic violence and blood that accompany most war films.  The violence is subtle.  When the 50 prisoners are executed at the end of the film only the machine gun and an empty truck are shown. It is all too clear what has happened.Watch this film and ""Stalag 17"" as a pair.  They provide interesting comparative approaches to the grim realities of prison camp life.  Both are unforgettable films.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"A great aventure, but a bad war movie","I have mixed feelings on this movie. It is a movie that appeals to me, it has a lot of things that I should like. Yet, I was utterly bored during the first half of this film, and by the time the setting changes and the action becomes more diverse, by the time it got interesting, I was disengaged emotionally.This movie's failure is structural. It is not the fault of the actors, it is not a bad story, it is not the cinematography or the music, rather it is the overall quality of these elements together that gives an underwhelming result. This movie is whatever the antonym of synergy is. If synergy is 1+1=3 then this movie is 1+1=1. The movie has nothing to offer other than a surface-level presentation. It is without any depth. It is devoid of depth. It is an illusion. When it shows Steve McQueen on a bike, that's what it is: Steve McQueen on a bike. There is no meaning, no signification, no symbolism, no reason. There is barely any tension or stakes.The film premise is a prisoner camp during WW2. Yet, surprisingly the movie is not a prison break movie. The atmosphere in the prison is barely inconvenient. They are well treated, they eat well, they are allowed to drink and get turnt. Almost all of the major characters have little schemes and when they are caught there is virtually no punishment or retribution. They repeatedly hatch these plans to get out, but there is no real tension, each issue or problem is immediately resolved with little cost or sacrifice and the attitude of the prisoners is so upbeat and confident that it deflates the drama that could have been. There is one character who is psychologically affected, and dies from it. And, it does give the main cast an opportunity for introspection, but it way too brief. McQueen is sent to the cooler repeatedly: it affects him in no way. However, that sequence is so jarringly different in tone with the rest of the movie that you are left puzzled when the movie switches back to the naïve prison shenanigans.Yet, the film is not a war movie either. It completely ignores any historical event, or any context. Granted, the bad guys are Germans and the good guys are British and American, but none of this has any implication whatsoever. The only thing that is unmistakably WW2 is when the SS are involved, but it is only abruptly and at the end. Instead, by the last act, you understand that it is an adventure film, and that all the tension and excitement will be delivered there. Once outside the camp, the movie's structure does not work against it anymore, and each vignette and separate adventure becomes unique and interesting.This movie is a testament of old Hollywood filmmaking. It did not really matter what the story was about, what mattered was the poster and how many people you could trick into buying a ticket. The actors were the characters and the setting was the story.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A Real Surprise and Treat from 1963,"This almost 3 hour long movie from 1963 unexpectedly drew me in and captivated me for the entire runtime. This doesn't happen every day. It's hard to believe how well The Great Escape has held up after all these years. The cast is phenomenal, the characters are very likable, and the story is engrossing. With such a long runtime, we get a chance to really get to know a lot of the characters. There are so many who play an important role in this escape attempt from a German POW camp. They turn prison escaping into an art form. It's fascinating watching all that goes into it. Oddly enough, this is the most lighthearted World War 2 POW film I've seen. There isn't much suffering shown. The prisoners are of good spirits throughout most of the story and the prison guards aren't so cruel as we normally see from such movies. It really makes you wonder why these characters are risking so much to escape. But when the time to escape comes, it's indeed suspenseful, and the suspense continues building from there. Trying to escape a German prison is one thing, but trying to escape the German occupied territory is quite another.There are some thrilling on-the-run scenes. You can really tell that a lot of time and talent went into making this movie. It's a great example of how good storytelling can make something timeless.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Good Great Escape,"While the World War II German-set Prison-of-War movie THE GREAT ESCAPE was being filmed, and would eventually make Steve McQueen a superstar, he was doing everything possible to ruining that potential since he wanted as many lines as other cast members, and would often storm off the set and at one point flew back home...Being especially envious of James Garner as Scrounger, the token sneaky resilient fella who can get anything, and -- teamed with polar opposite Donald Pleasance as a completely vulnerable Forger slowly going blind -- he's the most interesting and overall entertaining character...But McQueen didn't need more lines than Garner since, as The Cooler King, he's the maverick set up as a hero's hero from the very start... always looking for a way-out while constantly being sent to solitary confinement i.e. The prison within the prison... and his inevitable motorcycle jump finale would adorn the posters, so, words didn't make his character any more important...Especially since McQueen's always been a better actor when he doesn't try being the character, but simply IS the man of the hour -- yet neither McQueen or Garner are the genuine central leads...Director John Sturges's THE GREAT ESCAPE mainly belongs to Richard Attenborough by creating and leading the titular breakout, which first involves a lot of sneaky digging behind the German's backs and then, where most of the film takes place, horizontal tunnels that feel a bit too convenient for the dangerously claustrophobic reality to matter...But don't tell that to Charles Bronson who, as a Polish Tunnel King teamed with British digger John Leyton, is the one guy who gets stuck -- and it's Bronson the intensely-expressive character-actor here, not the future action star who would, unlike McQueen, prefer tough looks to dialogue...Overall making THE GREAT ESCAPE pretty darn good if somewhat overrated, and, with an iconic yet overly cheerfully-patriotic Elmer Bernstein score, the Germans never seem like a real threat as the Allied prisoners are able to treat Hitler's Nazis like teenage campers playing tricks on flabbergasted camp counselors...Ironically, the best thing about this ESCAPE is afterward when the group -- also including a laidback yet determined Australian James Coburn, British lads Gordon Jackson along with David McCallum -- attempt to get away after the getaway, providing an edgy sense of tension and suspense, far exceeding the varied path of getting there.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A perfect movie,"It's nearly three hours long, but not one boring minute. Being a true story added another dimension. There a number of campy parts but not enough to harm the movie. Stalag 17 was good too but a little too campy. Elmer Bernstein wrote an excellent score.

Rarely in a war movie are we shown the prisoner's point of view after a long time in captivity.  The detail that is shown in this film about the escape process and all the people, thought and preparation that is involved will mesmerize you.  And, if you can't get enough, then I also recommend Jean Renoir's French film, The Grand Illusion, which is similar, but not nearly as good as The Great Escape. After seeing The Great Escape, you'll want to run out and rent anything that stars Steve McQueen.  And you will never forget this movie--I promise.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A POW camp more comfortable than many 3 star motels.,"Even conceding the fact that this POW camp was run by the Luftwaffe and not the SS this has got to be the silliest representation of a POW camp ever put to film and I include ""Hogan's Heroes"" in this statement.  At least ""Hogan's Heroes"" admitted it was a comedy.  After viewing the Germans represented in this piece of malarkey I am surprised World War II lasted 6 months.  I remember wondering when I first saw this as a teenager why the Germans would allow a person in solitary confinement to have games to play.  Now I know 39 years later; they wouldn't. Considering how heroic the actual events really were it is shame to see them made to look so cartoonish in this vehicle for Steve McQueen.  Good thing for him the German's didn't know what was being planned in all those private POW rooms available to those crazy flyboy prisoners.  I noticed on the DVD box someone called it the greatest World War II movie ever made.  If it is then I guess the WW II veterans I talked to were really embellishing how tough it was.  I am not completely panning this movie because it is fun to see some very good performers in their younger years (I gave it 5 out of 10).  However, having seen this movie in 1964 and in 2002 I can't say it has aged well at all.  I suspected it was a sanitized piece of propaganda in 1964 and am quite sure of it now.",5.0,Anonymous,History

One of my favorites!  A Must See!,"""The Great Escape"" is one of those classic movies that parents seem to have a tough time getting their kids to sit down and watch it with them.  Now, with that in mind, I am a 16-year-old male.  I first saw this movie about three years ago when my mother managed to sit me down and have me watch it, and I LOVE this movie! There's really nothing bad you can say about this movie.  It starts off a little slow, but before you know it, you become very intrigued in the story. And before the process of the escape even began, I became very interested in the characters themselves.  Bronson's character, for example, probably received most of my sympathy throughout the film, because of his claustrophobia. This movie did a excellent job of forcing the audience to become involved in the characters before the initial escape even began.  And when that moment came, I was just as interested then as I was in the beginning of the movie. Great action sequences, too, even for an older movie.  And, as far as the acting goes, there were good performances all around (even by Charles Bronson!).  If you haven't seen this movie, I HIGHLY recommend it!  And, if you have kids in their teens, have them sit down and enjoy it with you. Hey, that's what happened in my situation, and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,History

A World War II Masterpeice,"I gave this film a 9 out of 10. The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because it tells one lie. No Americans actually participated in the escape.It is a historical fact that the escape was originally to be made by the Americans, but their tunnel, Tom, was discovered by German camp guards just a few days before the scheduled break. The movie shows how Tom was busted, but unfortunately does not reveal that it was the American tunnel. The second tunnel, Dick, was used instead, but that particular tunnel originated in a British barracks; therefore all the escapees were in fact British soldiers.Other than that, the rest of the details were unusually accurate, given the fact that Hollywood is not well known for sticking with facts. The Great Escape is an excellent chronology of a group of brave men attempting a nearly-impossible task with an amazing degree of success.The actual escape belongs on the list of greatest human efforts in history, and the movie belongs on the list of greatest films ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Classic escape by POWs...excellent work by all-male cast...,"If ever there was a film that calls for ensemble acting by an all-male cast, this is it. And no one lets you down--all are at the peak of their performing talents--James Garner, Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasance, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, David McCallum.There is no letdown in the purely ""escapist"" overall enjoyment of the film either--sorry for the pun. At times, it seems almost like fun to be in a prisoner of war camp where everybody is so chummy and having a good time as they plot and plan their marvelous but dangerous escape. The plot whirls forward in such a breezy manner that it hardly seems possible the film is as lengthy as it is--well over two and a half hours. Details of the escape are photographed expertly.An impressive offbeat performance by Charles Bronson as the claustrophobic man who digs the tunnel comes as somewhat of a surprise. He turns out to be one of the few lucky escapees. After the escape, the film follows the adventures of several of them as, in turn, each one almost gets away with their plan. Only grim note in their adventures is the machine-gunning episode of 50 men who are told to get out of a truck in the middle of a field ""for exercise"". And a lasting impression is made by the vivid way the photography captures McQueen's brazen attempt to escape on motorbike through the Bavarian countryside. Stunningly photographed and impressively scored. McQueen's chase scene is nothing short of spectacular, best seen on wide screen version.Surprisingly, the only Oscar nomination was for film editing.Escape films about POWs don't get any better--or more entertaining--than this one. By all means see it.",,Anonymous,History

The perfect film for holiday afternoons,"More or less guaranteed to be shown during holiday afternoons this is based on a true story. During WW2 the germans create a prison where they house all the most notorious escapees. It's a plan that is either ingenious, if they can keep everyone in, or stupid, if everyone escapes. As we all know from the movie it turns out to be an idea of the stupid variety.It's very interesting to watch the documentaries on the escape and discussions on whether it was worth it. The german officer that killed the escapees was following orders and was eventually executed himself after the war which is also a very interesting moral question. Should he have disobeyed the orders and been shot and did he deserve to die for obeying the orders.Anyway back to the film and it seems hard to believe that anybody could have not seen this. The Steve McQueen bike ride has gone into cinema folklore. The main purpose of the escape is to cause as much trouble as possible to the germans and thereby aide the allies. A great film, but also a sad story.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The Great Escape,"Performance by the characters leaves behind the direction. Steve McQueen is no doubt the star performer with his bike chase and all. The plot is gripping towards the end.

The movie is all about smart ideas to escape from the prison and there the movie scores pretty well.

Twizard Rating: 100,"If you've never seen a Steve McQueen movie before, this is a good one to start with. It was my first, and the only one I needed in order for me to be hooked. You somehow know it's going to be alright when he's on screen. Always ahead of his time with his colloquial demeanor, McQueen helps bridge the gap between old and new Hollywood, making the classics more accessible to younger audiences.But The Great Escape is entertaining even when McQueen isn't present. The 1963 classic mixes suspense and levity brilliantly as it follows a group of allied prisoners in a German camp attempting their biggest escape yet during World War II.The Great Escape is plot buildup at its finest. Writer-director, John Sturges, has an impeccable sense of narrative. From start to finish its tone never wavers. And even with its juggernaut of a runtime clocking in at nearly 3 hours, you're never checking your watch.Although in this day and age it helps to know the history--seeing as World War II was still fairly fresh in everyone's minds back in 1963. But setting aside, you can still appreciate the general storyline. Even a younger audience should be able to follow along easily and still enjoy this movie's timely humor.Elmer Bernstein's score helps to drive this film with strong motifs. It echoes The Bridge on the River Kwai, but has a feel all of its own.The Great Escape is a phenomenal film. It's consistent and thoroughly engaging, and the type of movie that just puts a smile on your face. With a little help from McQueen, it holds up very well. He's at his best here, like always.

He brings not only great action (check out the motorcycle scene), but also a sense of levity to his scenes that are fun and entertaining.

The best WWII film ever!,"I was a junior in high school when this movie was first shown on television. My dad, a WWII vet, urged me to sit down with him and watch it. But being a girl, and much too cool to watch movies with my father, I declined and spent the evening doing ""important"" things of which I have no memory. Several years later, I saw it in college on the big screen and adored it. What a great story!

It is the kind of sacrifice that my generation just didn't ""get"" and now that I am older have the utmost respect for. The generation that fought that war is truly the great generation of the 20th century. And one of my biggest regrets ever is that I did not watch it that night with my dad. It would have been a great bonding experience and maybe I would have gotten even more out of it watching it with someone who was actually in that war.

"One Of The Best ""Caper"" Films Of All-Time!","Film-making in the 1960s was a different exercise than it is today. It was more about ""putting on a good show"" and appealing to a wide audience instead of focusing on certain key groups. Back then, families went to movies together as ""outings"" and the movies were required to play as such. Sometimes, this leads to strange casting and watered-down plots. Other times, you get a movie like ""The Great Escape"", which combines perfect characters, music, and an intriguing plot to produce a masterpiece of its time.For a basic plot summary, ""The Great Escape"" is set at a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp where all the ""break-out artists"" are holed up together. Eluding the eyes and ears of the guards, the inmates start to work on getting out. Bartlett (Richard Attenborough) is the ring-leader, while other key roles are played by Steve McQueen, James Garner, Donald Pleasance, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and James Donald. To say anything more about the plot would be to give away too many key details.This movie is such a classic because it does so many things right, including:-Some of the best acting performances ever assembled in a single picture. Not a single scene is wasted due to all the on-screen talent. -Despite the tense setting, a sense of humor shines through (mainly coming from McQueen's character). -A plot that will have you on the edge of your seat. You can instantly identify with the characters, so you find yourself rooting for them as the escape plan builds and builds. -Not being predictable. You will think you know how this movie is going to end, but it throws you enough curveballs to always keep you off-balance.For a nearly three hour movie, ""The Great Escape"" never seems to lag or get boring whatsoever. It also features a score that contains a tune you will be whistling for days afterward. Basically, it is the type of movie where everything (cast, music, plot, direction) comes together for a perfect storm of film-making. If you are sometimes wary of WWII capers or older movies in general, do not let that stop you from watching this one. It is one of the best.",9.0,Anonymous,History
...two hundred and fifty or fifty...,"THE GREAT ESCAPE is a history adventure drama which describes, in a commercial way, an escape from a German stalag during World War II. The film is based on Paul Brickhill's 1950 book of the same name.In 1943, the Germans have moved all the prisoners of war, who are prone to running away, to a new high-security prisoner of war camp. Their commandant points out the various features of the new camp designed to prevent escape, as well as the advantages that the prisoners will receive as incentive not to try. After several failed attempts on the first day, the prisoners settle into life at the camp. Meanwhile, Gestapo agents bring the infamous ""Big X"" in the camp. He is introduced as the principal escape organizer. His attempt to escape will be punished by death. However, he, with the support of other escape artists, who are detained in the camp, plans the greatest escape ever attempted, with tunnels to break out 250 prisoners...The story is exciting and tense, with a lot of charm and humor. Unfortunately, it is stuck somewhere between fiction and truth. The characters are based on real men. However, the commercialization of this film, which can not credibly to follow historical facts, has made some damage. The protagonists are defiant, arrogant, disobedient, surprisingly resourceful and entertaining. Well, that is a successful Hollywood trick. The point has remained obscure. The tragic epilogue ends with a smile on the face of one of the rebels.Characterization is very good, given the large number of actors. There is no depth, but it is somewhat expected. Their expression has an amplitude only in a few scenes.Steve McQueen as Capt. Virgil Hilts, the ""Cooler King"" is a rebellious and persistent character. He is a subtle link between the two hostile sides. A baseball and glove are too excessive segments. However, his performance is very good. James Garner as Flt. Lt. Robert Hendley, the ""Scrounger"" is a creative and mysterious character. The credibility of his character is quite impaired, in a maximum-security prison, regardless of an apparent change in the second part of the film. Richard Attenborough as Sqn. Ldr. Roger Bartlett, ""Big X"" is, maybe, too quiet for a notorious prisoner or a great leader. He's a brain of their operation, in which the other participants have a greater role than him. However, he is their balance. Charles Bronson as Flt. Lt. Danny Velinski, the ""Tunnel King"", is an irreplaceable base of their operation. A melodrama of his character is a little exaggerated in climatic moments. Donald Pleasence as Flt. Lt. Colin Blythe, the ""Forger"" has offered the best performance of all the actors in this film. His humorous character becomes his personal tragedy and despair from which is born a strange friendship. James Coburn as Fg. Off. Louis Sedgwick, the ""Manufacturer"" is a man who finds himself in the right place at the right time. James Donald as Gp. Capt. Ramsey, the Senior British Officer (SBO) is a serious and calm captain who has a broad perception of the events around him.There is no strong emotions, everything is mechanically aligned.However, I enjoyed it.",9.0,Anonymous,History

McQueen's Breakout Role Lifts Muddy Film,"""The Great Escape"" is okay popcorn fare, a ""true-ish"" World War II movie that serves the facts of the real story of Stalag Luft III decently and serves the film's stars better. That's particularly true of one star, Steve McQueen, who had his most famous five minutes on screen cycling across Bavaria and never looked back.McQueen is Virgil Hilts, a ""hotshot pilot"" from the U.S. Army Air Force who makes for one restless POW. ""I haven't seen Berlin yet, from the ground or from the air,"" he tells the commandant of his prison camp, Col. von Lugar (Hannes Messemer). ""I plan on doing both before the war's over."" Hilts isn't the only one in the camp with big plans. The British, led by Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough), plot a breakout involving no less than 250 inmates. ""You're crazy...You oughta be locked up,"" Hilts tells Bartlett, pretty funny given their situation.Was Bartlett's scheme really such a good idea, even if you factor out the Nazi propensity for brutal overreaction? I can't say I think it was, and maybe that's one mark I'd make against a film that pretty much celebrates the real-life episode as a majestic sacrifice rather than a glory-hound escapade that backfired horribly. The success rate certainly didn't justify the supposed benefit Bartlett speaks of, tying up a few German troops who were on garrison duty anyway and hardly shoring up the Dnieper River Line.There are other issues I have with ""The Great Escape"". At two hours, fifty-two minutes, it's way overlong, with all but the last 45 minutes concerned with prep work. A script that was famously being written on the run creates various dramatic subplots involving the many characters which come and go as abruptly as James Coburn's Aussie accent.What director John Sturges and his team do bring to ""The Great Escape"" is undeniable texture, a feeling for prison-camp life that feels real even as it plays at Sgt. Fury-style heroics. A cast who knew World War II all-too-well but were willing to pretend it was more adventure then nightmare also contribute. The one standout besides McQueen is second-billed James Garner as Hendley ""the scrounger"", whose scenes with both Donald Pleasance (as a fellow inmate, a ""forger"" going blind) and Robert Graf (as German guard Werner) account for much of the film's erratic charm. The rousing Elmer Bernstein score is instantly recognizable and hummable, and there's McQueen, in what seems the third and most significant stage of Sturges' star-making program, after ""Never So Few"" and ""The Magnificent Seven.""Hilts is a strange center of gravity for ""The Great Escape"", spending most of his time away from the action, stuck in a cooler bouncing a baseball to himself while Attenborough directs things. Attenborough is a bit stiff; one senses his heart wasn't in the role. McQueen does get more involved in the plot as it rolls along, collecting bunk slats to buttress the tunnel being dug beneath the camp. He's not as loose as he would be later on; and struggles a bit with the more comedic scenes. Whoever came up with the idea of him marching through the camp playing a fife probably was drinking too much potato vodka. But his confrontations with von Lugar, scrunching his face into a cocky grin, give the film much of the lift it has when he's not on that motorcycle.Messemer may have the film's most interesting role; a sympathetic Luftwaffe officer who pushes back when the Gestapo and SS tell him to take a firmer hand. He's a good man, even if he knows he's serving a bad cause, and his scenes with both McQueen and James Donald as the head British POW give you a sense of the emotional toll of war even when the combatants involved are decent.Many people like this film better than I do, and bless them. It's smart and entertaining; sometimes both at once. You can't help but be moved by the story behind the film, real as it was. Too bad the question of ""was it worth it"" is never satisfactorily presented, let alone answered.",6.0,Anonymous,History
An Epic Light in Tone and then Suddenly Dark,"The Great Escape interestingly makes POW camps look laidback and to some extent even fun. This is not for the whole film and the horrors of Nazi Germany and WWII are in full display here but much of the film is fun rather than dark.

The first part centres on the build up of the escape with the movie's tongue firmly in its cheek ( Werner the stupid German , man jumps on bunk and it collapses etc ) with the prisoners on the run making up the second part of the story which is more serious in tone .

Action-Packed Adventure From Start To Finish,"A fascinating account of a massive escape by Allied prisoners of war from a German prison camp during World War II. The audience is drawn into the story right from the beginning, as we learn that all the ""rotten eggs"" the Germans have captured (the prisoners who have made repeated escape attempts) are being moved together into one prison. Question: how will they manage to pull this off when, given the kind of prisoners they are, the Germans must be watching every move?Great performances, especially from Richard Attenborough as Bartlett (""Big X"") who is in charge of the escape attempt, Steve McQueen as Hilts, who continually draws the wrath of his captors and is repeatedly sentenced to the cooler, and James Garner as Hendley, who scrounges the needed materials any way he can. The movie featured an interesting performance from Charles Bronson as the Polish prisoner Danny. I never quite understood Danny. He spent days on end underground helping to dig the tunnel, then was afraid to escape through it because he was claustrophobic? Did I miss something here? That one didn't make sense to me.The only fault I really found with the movie was the portrayal of life in a German prison camp. The whole thing just seemed too comfortable. I found it difficult to believe that the Nazis treated their prisoners as well as seemed to be the case here. True, the movie does infer that the camp Kommandant - Von Luger, played by Hannes Messemer - was not exactly a fanatical Nazi. I enjoyed the scene where the Gestapo and SS officers who visited him had to drag a rather half-hearted ""Heil Hitler"" from him. Still, conditions in this camp just seemed too good - almost a ""Hogan's Heroes"" vision of life in a German POW camp.That aside, this was an excellent movie, and I would give it an 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Greatest,"Although this amazing WW2 film is based on fact, and does play with the facts a bit, it still ranks as possibly the greatest and certainly most entertaining WW2 movie ever produced. I will try to explain why.Firstly, the cast is not only top notch but possibly the best film for the majority of those in the film - an amazing thing its own right. I believe you can make the case for not only McQueen but James Garner, Charles Bronson, Donald Pleasance, Richard Attenborough and James Coburn who all went on to great careers as a result of their work here. McQueen and Bronson were amazing in The Magnificent 7 (1960) but I think their stardom was secured here. What a perfect ensemble.Secondly, the story of these brave men gives all of us a model for our own lives. The message is simple - when you have a duty to others, you do it even if it means sacrificing your own life. This is quite a hurdle for most of us, but not for the many brilliant and courageous men at Stalag 3. They were the best of the best and we knew they were right off the bat. The film does not waste time on declaring what the overriding purpose is of these men's lives, now confined. It is to escape. And they are at it barely into the first few minutes if the film. From there, it is a journey that we happily and vicariously take with them just as if we are there with shovels. The journey also has the fabulous suspense of now knowing who makes it in the end, and I will leave that to find out for the few people that have still not watched The Great Escape.Finally, the score by Elmer Bernstein is simply the best film score of all time. I know that is going out on the limb of hyperbole, but I will accept the challenge. I would argue that the music is not only the most memorable in its own right but the thematic variations of the score fits so perfectly within the variety of scenes and emotions of the men, individually and as group. I was 8 years old when this film was first shown on network TV. It's hard to keep 8 yr old boys attentive for a movie as long as this one clocked out, but I was hooked from beginning to end. The next day in school, the kids were humming that tune and had found a new hero to emulate next to James Bond in Steve McQueen.Interesting trivia - McQueen not only did most of the finale's motorcycle stunts (except the big leap, for insurance purposes not allowed) but also switched roles and played the very Germans that were after him - on their bikes. Cool.As a sidebar, I may be the first one to get this connection as I have not seen anyone catch it, but here goes. McQueen's swashbuckling motorcycle riding character Hilts was called ""The Cooler King"" by his comrades because he never quit doing the things he did to get in the ""Cooler"". Maybe that was why he was henceforth called the ""King of Cool? I don't think that's a coincidence.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Cooler than the Cooler King,"What can I say?  I have spent many an hour torturing myself over that inimitable question ""What are my ten favourite films?"".

WE'RE not sitting out this war comfortably!,"In one of the first of the multi-superstar war films (following on the heels of the biggest one, The Longest Day), The Great Escape follows the planning and execution of a massive escape attempt from a Nazi POW camp during World War II by Allied prisoners. The determination of these men and the absolute thoroughness of their plan is what's on center stage here. Led by Richard Attenborough (back when he was just an actor, not an Academy award-winning director), the men decide to tunnel out of the camp in three places - this way, if one tunnel is discovered by the Germans, the other two tunnels will still be viable options.Attenborough's not the big star here, though; that honor goes to the young Steve McQueen, with that rebellious smile and blonde locks going a long way toward cementing his own movie superstardom. Oh, and James Garner, and Charles Bronson as a Russian (!), James Coburn, and even Donald Pleasance as a myopic forger. Who will survive the escape? And what will happen to those who do once they've left the walls of the prison?If you're a fan of action, this is a prime movie for you.

An enjoyable and intelligent WW2 flick.,"Considering that i am quite young (born 1985) i usually dislike these older movies even though they have great rating and comments etc, but somehow this has changed my opinion, actually i think it was quite good, well, actually very good and very enjoyable, i think this may be because it is not dependant on special effects at all, it's a straight out movie without any computer reliable stuff, which makes for a movie where i dont fint myself thinking ""Damn that doesnt look to cool"", which is nice.The movie itself is very entertaining, throughout almost 3 hours you can barely find a dull moment, which is fantastic, the movie is pretty fast paced all the way through, and it's enjoyable to see each character develop their personality and together as they work towards their goal. It is a well written story that holds your interest all the way through, and the acting is pretty nice too, something i usually dislike about older movies as well, but it works well here.Now one thing i can put thumps up to is the slightly untraditional ending, after they escaped rather early in the movie i had myself thinking how they would waste the final hour now, but they actually manage to throw in a few surprise, now without giving up the ending i must admit i think it was good that it didn't follow the typical happy ending where all slips away and lives happily ever after, the loss of some important characters combined with the survival of others makes for a nearly perfect ending, that is, as said, slighly untraditional. Also that is far more realistic than the typical Hollywood endings.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

"An adventure story, not a war story","It's a World War II adventure movie loosely based on Paul Brickhill's 1950 memoir based on the real Great Escape. It's an ensemble buddy film based from 1942 to 1944 in Stalag Luft III near Sagan, Lower Silesia.The film begins by showing the opening of the new prisoner of war camp built to contain prisoners especially prone to escape. We slowly meet the main characters who include Squadron Leader and overall plot coordinator, Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough). Group Captain Ramsey (James Donald) is the overall leader of the prisoners.Two Americans have a special role--Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen) is a serial escaper who on one occasion reconnoiters the area in order to be captured and bring back information. Bob Hendley (James Garner) is a smooth-talking scrounger for necessary tools and equipment. Louis Sedgwick (James Coburn) is an Australian who helps make things.There are tunnelers like Danny Welinski (Charles Bronson) and Willie Dickes (John Leyton). Colin Blythe (Donald Pleasence) is the going-blind forger of crucial documents.The brash prisoners make great progress with occasional setbacks, and finally, 76 manage to escape before the tunnel is discovered. The movie then follows what happens to the men who managed to escape.""The Great Escape"" has lots of action and a memorable musical score by Elmer Bernstein. That's all a plus and a lot of fun. Unfortunately, most of it is fictional except for the barest outline. By 1944 no Americans were left in Stalag Luft III; they had been moved elsewhere. So there was no real ""Steve McQueen"" character. No motorcycles were used by escapees. No escapees were shot in large groups, though the total number killed is accurately told. Canadians are invisible in the movie, though they had a significant role in the actual plot.I totally agree with the New York Times critic who said the prisoners' spirit of swagger and defiance in the film was totally unbelievable. So watch it only as a Hollywood adventure story, not as history or a realistic movie about war.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Tension and urgency,"The great escape, with all of its fame, winds up being quite a disappointment for me. There is just no emotional attachment to any of the characters from this movie. The Germans allow the prisoners wonder around, the whole prison camp feel more like a summer camp than a WWII prison camp. The work camp in the movie ""holes"" was 10 times tougher on its residents than this prison camp, and that was only a juvenile correctional camp. The entire movie seem to be constructed to build the ""hero"" characters portrayed by McQueen. There're so many people here proclaim this is Steve McQueen's best work. Well I am not very familiar with Steve McQueen, but his acting job, while completely competent, sure is nothing to write home about. The entire movie is unnecessarily lengthy and drawn out while at the same time completed devoid of the spirit of the brave men keeping their fight going even under imprisonment. It feels more like a teen schemed, prank fest than a epic tale of heroism. Someone here stated this is as much of a WWII movie as ""Saving Private Ryan"".

McQueen's Attire,"One thing that puzzles me about McQueen's attire in ""The Great Escape"".  How come he's the only one who doesn't wear any uniform?  And his clothing is more like the 1960s with his tight white pants and sweat shirt.  And he seemed more intent at playing a cool 1960s rebellious character than the 1940s officer he was supposed to be.  Didn't the director have any control over him at all?  Or was Steve McQueen only interested in his image?  He looked totally out of place even amongst the other Americans in the camp.  I accept the fact that as it was a Hollywood production there would be a fair number of US actors in it.  According to a recent documentary on British TV, only 3 Americans were incarcerated in the POW camp - the remainder being British,  Australians and the other Commonwealth countries, Poles, French and Dutch.",,Anonymous,History
The Great Escape: 8/10,"Young children will know it as Chicken Run, while older folk (like myself, at the ripe old age of 14) know it as The Great Escape, the classic POW escape film from 1963 with Steve McQueen and James Garner. With its familiar score by Elmer Bernstein, The Great Escape puts us into a German POW camp and we go along with everybody to try to escape in this three hour film.The smorgasbord of characters include Hilts, the `Cooler King' (McQueen), who spends much of his time in isolation, Hendley, the `Scrounger' (Garner), who can get anything he wants, and Danny, the `Tunnel King' (Charles Bronson). During WWII, these people are sent to the POW camp, and decide to escape by digging three tunnels under the camp, nicknamed Tom, Dick, and Harry. If one fails, then they move onto the next. Two hours are spent on this, and the third is spent on what happens to those who escape.Wait a minute! Did I just give away the ending? No, because of two reasons. One is the title: The Great Escape. It isn't called The Great Attempt to Escape. Also, the opening titles say how this is a true story, et cetera, so you know what basically happens. That doesn't mean, however, that it isn't a thrilling and enthralling piece of work. I wasn't exactly on the edge of my seat for the entire piece, but the 2 hours and 52 minutes flew by, and I didn't want to leave the film. I was engaged with everything this picture brought me: an interesting ensemble of characters (alas, like all ensemble movies like this, it's hard to keep track of EVERY character), an interesting and authentic (and I mean AUTHENTIC) set, and a certain air of unpredictability. I knew what was going to happen for some of it, but what happened overall and to each individual, I had no idea.There were some very good action scenes, also. Hilts, after he escapes, is evading German officers on a motorbike (possibly the most famous sequence of the film). He did most of the stunts himself. There was never a dull moment. The set looked very authentic, and it was shot on location. Although it's obvious how they shot it, it really looked like a tunnel under a POW camp.

Enjoyable film,"Realizing that I was not supposed to accept `The Great Escape' as High Art, I found it to be an entertaining film.  The story about a group of hard-scrabble soldiers in a German P.O.W. camp who are rounded up and thrown together because they are the prisoners who have attempted escape the most, is not deep in the slightest, and fairly formulaic, (I was able to announce the ending of the film, music, dialogue and all, about ten minutes before the actual end) but enjoyable nonetheless.One thing that I enjoyed knowing while watching the film was that the director, John Sturges, not only is the director of one of those other `manly man classic' films, `The Magnificent Seven', but the director of the god-awful Gene Hackman film, `Marooned' that was so gleefully torn apart on Mystery Science Theater 3000.  I guess for every few good films, you can be allowed a stinker.  That's only one of the many lessons I learned watching `The Great Escape', however.  Among the many things I learned as I enjoyed this film were that James Coburn should never attempt an Australian accent, that Charles Bronson was unbelievably buff in 1963, and Steve McQueen always looked 43 years old.`The Great Escape' is a good film and deserves its place on the IMDB top 250 list, but it certainly has a core audience, and while I truly enjoyed the film, I'm not really a member of that core audience.  I liked it enough to appreciate it and give it a good review once, but I don't think I'll be sneaking this one into the DVD player in the next five years.

Tunneling at it's Finest,"Who hasn't been caught whistling the theme song from The Great Escape? I know I have. It's one of the many great qualities to the movie. Along with the catchy song, there is a gripping plot, a great cast, and everything put together makes for one memorable movie.Our story starts as new POW's, American and British, enter a new Nazi POW camp. The new ""campers"" include Roger Bartlett (Sir Richard Attenborough) or the ""Big X"", Bob Hendley (James Garner) ""The Scrounger"", and of course Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen) ""The Cooler"". Along with others like Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Donald Pleasance, a group of about 250 men are determined to escape this Nazi hell hole.An intricate system of signals and distractions keep the goons off of their backs. The plan is to tunnel out of the camp into the nearby wooded area. From their they will disguise themselves are German citizens and make their way back to their respective countries. This will require clothing, paperwork, acting, and other supplies needed to blend in and look normal to a German Officer outside of the camp.This true story of how soldier's tried to outsmart the German's is one that is fascinating and amusing. The little things like hiding supplies, the tunnels, and the immense amount of dirt is incredible and quite ingenious. Imagine trying to tunnel deep enough underground so no one knows what you're doing and keeping it undercover. Not to mention sneaking 250 people out at once. It's quite a challenge.This war drama is one of the best of it's era and genre of all time. What sets this movie apart from the rest is a riveting story added with some Hollywood magic to bring it back to life.

Although the entire cast were outstanding, Steve made the movie for me.

John Sturges Takes You Prisoner,"In 1942, Allied prisoners of World War II who repeatedly try to escape are placed by the Germans in a maximum security camp called ""Stalag Luft III"". As you might expect, they try to escape. Repeatedly. Giving the prisoners a lot of time to meet without supervision, the Germans may be foreshadowing the ""Hogan's Heroes"" TV series that poked fun at this film. Top-billed is super-cool Steve McQueen (as Virgil Hilts). He's always earning himself solitary confinement. You'll notice Mr. McQueen looks sharper coming out of ""The Cooler"" than he does going in, sliding his jacket down the wall of the cell without fear of scratching the leather. That's cool...Also billed above the title are super-nice James Garner (as Bob Hendley) and mastermind Richard Attenborough (as Roger Bartlett), who travels with English-accented Gordon Jackson (as Andy ""Mac"" MacDonald). Known as a scrounger, Mr. Garner takes commendable action when told his forger pal Donald Pleasance (as Colin Blythe) should not go on ""The Great Escape"" due to a disability. Garner insists on taking his friend, although it will risk the mission - and both their lives. That's nice...Most valuable players may be muscular Charles Bronson (as Danny Velinski) and his blond companion John Leyton (as William ""Willie"" Dickes). These two tunnel diggers actually love each other; you can't definitively say they are gay, but you can't definitively say they aren't, either. Most surprising are the number of people who actually make it out successfully, with Australian manufacturer James Coburn (as Louis Sedgwick) being the second most likely to succeed, due to his choosing not to travel light. British sailor David McCallum (as Eric Ashley-Pitt) develops ways to disperse dirt, and Angus Lennie (as Archibald ""Archie"" Ives) is a short-lived favorite...Senior British officer James Donald (as Ramsey) holds down the fort and Hannes Messemer (as Oberst von Luger) humanizes the opposition with a notably ""Best Supporting Actor"" worthy performance. Nicely produced and directed by John Sturges, ""This is a true story. Although the characters are composites of real men and time and place have been compressed, every detail of the escape is the way it really happened."" Helping Mr. Sturges in the production are composer Elmer Bernstein, photographer Daniel L. Fapp, and film editor Ferris Webster. This movie is a little long and probably not all that accurate, but ""The Great Escape"" is a great one.********* The Great Escape (6/20/63) John Sturges ~ Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson",9.0,Anonymous,History
An absolute classic,I watched this movie at a young age and it was my favourite movie then and it might still be now. Each scene is a brilliantly shot masterpiece and each character earns a soft spot in my heart (apart from the Germans). There is no bad scene in this long film and I think it is deserving of most epic war film with many other brilliant war films. But I do not want any greedy movie maker to look at this film and think of a sequel because I do not want anyone to touch this film. I highly recommend it for ages 10 and over.,10.0,Anonymous,History
Classic but lacks depth,"This movie is based on real-event; and undoubtedly very amusing classic from 60s. The great escape is irrefutably a great movie of that time. But what i personally prefer in 60s movie is not their story-line, cinematography; but dialogue. When I watch any movies from 1960s, I always expect depth of dialogue to be something that we highly lacks in modern movies. But unfortunately, this particular movie didn't give me that vibe. On the other hand, POWs in Germany where not treated as humanely in Nazi Germany as it is depicted here. That is why some scenes were somewhat disturbing. I would suggest any conscious viewer to cross-check the facts before watching this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A Leslie Nielsen movie,"The movie is absolutely ridiculous. The most overrated piece of art of all time.Let me tell you something. Unless you are British, you are going to hate this absolute dog of a film. And the British love it, just because a super-cool guy like Steve McQueen hangs out with the British folks and also for the main theme (let's all chant!).Accurate? German WW2 POW camp? Sounds more like summer camp to me! These people are caught trying to escape and the Nazis just take them by the hand to get them back in line. And they still wear their uniforms, not some prison overalls -which is the first thing the Germans would do: take off their pride. It's a joke really!Let me be more specific: the English (and the one American) can do WHATEVER they want in this camp, while the Nazis are just waiting for someone to escape in order to get them back in prison. And what about those secret meetings! The Germans were minding their own business, while the POWs were designing plots to escape. Yeah, right!Apart from all that, the movie is boring, not going anywhere. No acts of heroism, no surprises, no script, no women.I wouldn't care for the story if at least there was some realism in this horrible movie, but a parody is all you get. If instead of McQueen it was Leslie Nielsen, we would have a great comedy.0/10 (what a joke!)",1.0,Anonymous,History
Don't escape from watching this.,"You know how everyone describes Steve McQueen as ""cool""? Well, ""The Great Escape"" shows why. As Capt. Virgil ""The Cooler King"" Hilts, trying with several other POWs to escape from a Nazi camp, he tunnels his way to coolness. Of course, he isn't the only character. There's visually impaired Flight Lt. Colin ""The Forger"" Blythe (Donald Pleasance), action-ready Flight Lt. Bob Anthony ""The Scrounger"" Hendley (James Garner), flippant Flight Officer Louis ""The Manufacturer"" Sedgwick (James Coburn), Flight Lt. Danny ""The Tunnel King"" Velinski (Charles Bronson), and others. Obviously, the setting didn't look too realistic (one would expect a POW camp to be a little dirtier than the one here), but either way, this is a cool movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The greatest piece of Escapism Cinema has to offer!,"I first enjoyed this classic war film in 1970 aged 11 when it was screened in 16mm at my all boys Boarding school. We had film shows once every 2 weeks and the most popular were always of the patriotic kind like Zulu or The Guns of Navarone but when The Great Escape came along I was hooked and the entire school was in uproar and cheering when Steve Mcqueen hurls his motorbike over the barbed wire ( The single most memorable and exciting scene from any film ever!!). Being involved in the film industry I was very excited back in 1995 as part of the VE day celebrations to give a special screening of The Great Escape at a Big Screen Cinema and have as a special guest speaker a former prisoner at Stalag Luft 111 in 1943 and involved in the actual escape plans, Mr Alan E. Bryatt.  As a piece of entertainment he agreed that the film was excellent and in many ways quite accurate (although the actual escape took place in snowbound conditions!) The Great Escape has been enormously influential to filmakers everywhere and I believe that many scenes and characters from this film will be etched in the minds of filmlovers forever!",10.0,Anonymous,History
The Greatest Movie Of All TIme,"The Great Escape in my opinion is the greatest war movie that i have ever seen. Although i may not be a veteran of the silver screen, i have enjoyed this film each and every time i watch it. Based on a book by Paul Brickhall about the true exploits of Allied troops in World War II, the film is set in a German Prison Camp which had been built with the sole purpose of holding Allied prisoners who just would not stay captured. The Nazis, in bringing all these prisoners in the same place, assembled the greatest escape minds the Brits and Yanks could ever have produced.The ensuing actions never fails to entertain with roaming landscapes and an excellent score by Elmer Bernstein all add up to an beautifully directed movie by John Sturges, of Magnificent Seven Fame, with an unbeatable cast at the height of there powers with McQueen, Attenborough, Garner, Bronson, Coburn and many, many more.I hope my comments help you in your decision. Did I mention it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion picture in 1964?",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Film that Defines the term Classic,"The Great Escape is certainly among the top 5 films ever made of World War II. Steve McQueen is superb, even though his part was written as they went along. You've got to love James Garner the scrounger and helpmate the Donald Pleasance (The Forger) and interestingly a prisoner of war himself. John Sturges the Producer/Director had just come off ""The Magnificent Seven"" so he was as hot as the core of the sun. Basically the film is about the indominable will of the human spirit. It chronicals the greatest escape attempt of the war, what it doesn't tell you is that it diverted the attention of nearly a million German soldiers from the landing on D-Day. A magnificent epic, gorgeously transfered in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio with a score by Elmer Bernstein that will ring in your ears for a good week after watching the film. 10/10",,Anonymous,History
Escapist entertainment,"I'm a little surprised ar how highly this movie is rated by IMBD fans. It's a decent movie with a lot of stars but a lot of it reminds me of ""Hogan's Heroes"" without the laugh track. Characters played by Steve McQueen and James Garner act more like they're in summer camp instead of a German prison camp. Ohhh, big penalty--put him in the cooler (a little prison cell where McQueen plays handball) for trying to escape. ""Stalag 17"" was not only a more convincing POW film but it had a more satisfying ending.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Steve McQueen is cool.  Period.,"The Great Escape is one of my all-time favorite movies.  The cinematography, the story, the acting, the directing - all excellent.  But it's Steve McQueen that takes it to another level and makes me want to watch it time and again.  He's more than cool, he's the ""cooler king"".  From bouncing the baseball in his cell to the edge-of-your-seat motorcycle stunts he steals the film every time he comes onscreen. The plot is based on a real life escape from a German POW camp in WWII and follows the group who hatched the plot from it's inception to it's aftermath.  Other notable performances include Donald Pleasance and the even a passable role from James Garner.  Not to mention Sir Richard Attenborough, Charlie Bronson etc - the list seems endless.  How they afforded all these stars is beyond me, but I'm glad they forked over the cash.If you haven't seen this movie yet, put it on your short list.

The movie I have watched more times than any other,"As the other reviewers have suggested, one of the greatest movies ever made. As it does not need any further endorsement, I thought I might provide a few interesting sidelines.The book on which the movie is based, by the Australian author Paul Brickhill, is equally good. Brickhill is a writer who specialised in world war 2 true stories; he also wrote 'Reach for the Sky'(the story of Douglas Bader) and 'the Dambusters', both of which were also made into stirring films. Brickhill is a master story teller whose books rush on breathlessly and really do defy the reader to put them down.In the book, as was actually the case, American characters hardly figure at all; obviously the introduction of characters such as Steve McQueen's Hilts was intended to make the movie more palatable for US audiences. For once this tampering with the source does not at all prove a negative. This is obvious when you consider that easily the most memorable sequence in the film, McQueen's attempt to leap the barbed wire border on his motorbike, is the fruit of this invention.I think that the inclusion of James Coburns' character, Sedgewick, was made in acknowledgement of the author's nationality. Brickhill was an inmate himself at the prison camp where the great escape took place. Sedgewick is evidently an Australian, though you would never know from Coburn's egregious attempt at an Australian accent.Richard Attenborough's character, Bartlett, the big X or escape coordinator, is based on the Roger Bushell of the book. Why change the name from Bushell to Bartlett? Just a case of someone justifying their paycheck, perhaps.Additional dialogue for the movie was written by James Clavell, author of King Rat, Shogun etc. This is pure surmise, but I'm almost certain which scenes are his contributions: those where Bronson and Coburn attempt to escape with the Russian slave-labourers; when Wing Commander Day, asked by the commandant why he, an English gemtleman, is growing vegetables, not flowers ('you can't eat flowers'); and the one where the Americans distill some bootleg grog to celebrate American independence day.Finally an opinion on the music of Elmer Bernstein. It seems to me that it, like Mozart's, can be immediately atrributed to the composer, even on a first hearing, obviously without a suggestion that they are in any way repetitive. Consider the music for this movie, the Comancheros and the Magnificent Seven.",10.0,Anonymous,History
One of the all-time favorites,"Really interesting and fun to watch from beginning to end: Keeps you locked to that chair which is a rare quality in slightly longer than usual movies. Excellent direction and acting from A to Z. I have owned this movie for 10 years and still go back and watch it every once in while. Of course I would do that with ""any"" McQueen movie but this is his best with a top multi-star cast. For Escape movies fans I can't recommend really anything like this one, especially in a war setting; perhaps the sole exception could be the Grand Illusion, the French classic from the 30's in quite a different setting. There are plenty of other ""escape"" movies in a civil setting, though (involving jail escapes). For McQueen fans I'd recommend any of his movies: he managed to get always fun and interesting roles that fit his character completely: Thomas Crown Affair, Cincinnati Kid, Papillon (talk 'bout a Escape movie!), The Getaway (with Ali Mc Graw- great fun- a must to see).",,Anonymous,History
Very  Good  Entertaining  but   Not   the Best  Ever,"This a very good film about the massive escape from a German concentration camp by prisoner allied officers during World War II. No doubt about it. John Surges was indeed and intelligent director whose best products where in the western genre (""Gunfight at the OK Corral"", ""The Magnificent Seven"")in my opinion. No doubt also that ""The Great Escape"" reaches the rank of an epic spectacular film and is enjoyable and entertaining. Efficient actors also and a great musical score.However, and as for me, it is perhaps the fact that the story is based on real happenings that sort of limited the script and Sturges usual daring in doing movies; it seems as if the director sort of self control himself in order to go along with the real facts and show the in the most accurate way. In such terms, the film turns out as sort of standard and lacks real impact in all.Don't get me wrong; this is a very good movie no doubt, interesting, entertaining and tense. But I think the focus on the true story and how things really happened gives it a sort of colourful documentary sense that demerits a bit what you expect from a war film of its undenieble level.",6.0,Anonymous,History

A Great Escape to the Movies!,"This film can make the 'greatest' list in so many categories, it's unbelievable! Greatest War Film; greatest chase; greatest historical piece; and let's begin with the greatest cast: I don't see too many surveys done on which film has the best overall cast, but this one must be it. McQueen - the king of cool and number one star with this film; Garner - almost as cool as McQueen; Attenborough - never utilized better than as Big X, the Brit stiff upper lip; Bronson - future superstar as a steady presence; Coburn - insolent mod sixties before it was chic; Pleasence - the quiet English reserve masking a powerhouse character; McCallum - before taking over TV with superspy Solo. And the beauty of it was, they were all packed together in one spot (one camp), plotting and scheming together until the inevitable chasing began.This is the perfect adventure film and is endowed with an aura of greatness because it's based on real facts during the greatest war in the history of the world. It made a real impression on me when I saw it as a kid. I was fascinated by all the chief characters as they were introduced, all seemingly trapped forever in a cycle of escape and capture (as I was very young at the time, the length of World War II seemed like half a lifetime to me). Forced into such an existence, each character became an expert - not only in the art of escape - but in other esoteric disciplines, as well. In a way, the story comes across as an ideal game to a boy: the good guys are the best at what they do and must match wits with their captors, the bad Nazis. There's a lot of tension built up right from the start (as McQueen and others try their first escape attempts on the first day) but it's the planning by the prisoners, which we are privy to, that provides a truly interesting film experience. Some of the solutions they come up with are ingenious.And then, the 3rd act, the actual escape. Where one usually expects a film so strong in the beginning and middle to bog down a bit, this one just explodes all over Germany. Though I've seen McQueen's mad dash on the motorcycle 15 times by now, it's still as thrilling as ever. But it's not just him; you follow along with many of the escapees in their clever, sometimes desperate bids for freedom. Again, it's a great game, but the possibilities and consequences can have a tremendous impact.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A highly organized exodus strung together by intricate coordination using where everyone involved has a job to do. Escape from Germany uses every means possible whether it be by boat, plane, bike, motorcycle, or train. Great near finale scene with McQueen (who did all his own stunts) trying to jump over the Swiss border on motorcycle while being pursude on all sides by the enemy.

Fine Tribute,"An all-star cast, long runtime, quality movie.Who doesn't like a well thought well out coordinated escape movie? The setting was a WW2 Germany prisoner camp. This was no ordinary prison camp; this was full of prisoners bent on escaping. Whether they successfully escaped or not was not the only motive. From their collective patriotic goal (even though they were all from different countries) was to at least muck up the aims of the Gestapo.The movie moved much like a chess game and just as long. At nearly three hours it was a culmination of individually moving parts trying to put themselves in place: the prisoners in place to escape and the Third Reich in place to foil such an escape.

"Dull, fad following, cliché of a flop","This movie is about a massive escape from a German prison camp. Unlike the fast paced and intriguing ""Stalag 17"", this movie is plodding, dull, and yet no more realistic. Everyone looks squeaky clean, which already makes it lack any of the realism of the Holden-Brand classic.A lot of big name stars are in this, led by the contemplative Richard Attenborough. The film tries to draw us into the lives of James Garner and Steve McQueen, but loses us terribly. Every war cliché is in this movie. And the director probably caved in to McQueen's insistence upon the use of motor vehicles, giving us another stupid, boring motorcycle chase no one cares about, except McQueen's red neck club. Even Garner has to get into the driving act by somehow getting a German plane. So much for realism. To top it off, we are treated to the usual cliché of kill the nearsighted man, Hollywood's favorite whipping post, and the subject of heinous prejudice unequaled.You really have to plod through this ordeal.

The Great Escape (1963),"Directed by John Sturges. Starring Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborough, James Garner, Donald Pleasence, Charles Bronson, James Donald, Gordon Jackson, Hannes Messemer, Angus Lennie, James Coburn, John Leyton, David McCallum, Robert Graf, Nigel Stock.Classic POW film dramatizing the efforts of hundreds of prisoners to escape a German stalag during World War II. Director Sturges assembled a fine ensemble cast (including a few of the gunfighters from his earlier film, ""The Magnificent Seven""), shot it on scenic locations primarily in and around Bavaria, and oiled the machine with plenty of action, humor, suspense and pathos. No real depth or psychological interest; just terrific escapist entertainment. Based on Paul Brickhill's nonfiction book of the same name. Composer Elmer Bernstein (who had also previously worked with Sturges on ""The Magnificent Seven"") provides the unforgettable score. A Hollywood crowd-pleaser, not a history lesson--though the opening disclaimer notes that changes/composites were made to the characters and timeline, it also promises that ""every detail of the escape is the way it really happened"" (which is also quite inaccurate).87/100",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Is definitely a great adventure, hands down.","Inspired by a true story and based on Paul Brickhill's novel, John Sturges' ""The Great Escape"" is a great adventure, hands down.  The tale begins as a mass of Allied P.O.W.s (hauled in trucks) arrive at a new camp that's run by the Germans and is solely described as ""escape-proof"".  It doesn't take long for one prisoner, Virgil Hilts (the late Steve McQueen), who earns the nickname ""The Cooler King"" for his failed escape attempts. Hilts isn't the only prisoner who wants out, a few others hatch a plan to get 250 men out in one night.  How its executed is a stroke of pure genius and skill.  The movie has a vast variety of characters who are allowed to show their feelings, which is a nice touch.  There two characters who make solid examples and I cared for the most.  One is Colin Blythe (the late Donald Pleasence), a gentle Brit who specializes in forging names and goes blind.  The other one in Danny Willinski (Charles Bronson), a Russian who excells in digging tunnels and tends to get rattled.  The performances here are just perfect and the musical score by Elmer Bernstein is one of the best ones that I've heard.  This movie would serve as a great history lesson for any student (middle or high).",10.0,Anonymous,History
Ya vas lyublyu. The Great POW escape film.,"This is the ultimate Second World War, Prisoner Of War escape film. Forget your Escape to Victory (1981) or Von Ryan's Express (1965) this is it!Why, let's run through the film.1. Cast. Probably the greatest ensemble cast of Hollywood and Commonwealth acting talent ever put to film (or good use anyway). Be it the Commonwealth/British acting talent of the likes of Richard Attenborough or Hollywood heavyweights such as Steve McQueen and James Garner. Add the likes of Donald Pleasance, Charles Bronson and others. The list is endless. Their characters all have a vital role in the operation, hence their nicknames in the film such as The Tunnel King or The Scrounger.....2. Music. A rousing score by Elmer Bernstein that is still revered to this day.3. Length. This film is long, approximately 172 minutes. Just below epic length. It allows for all the facets of the escape operation to be played out in all their glory. Every dollar/pound or whatever is on the screen.4. Historical accuracy. Okay some of the more pedantic reviews may sniff about the historical accuracy but the main events happened. There is some artistic licence added to the screenplay no doubt but in what Hollywood production isn't there?5, The poster doesn't have little boxes of the stars faces that is so often the case in films with multiple star attractions but is ultimately a let down! Good marketing in my opinion.If I have any complaints with the film (albeit minor) it is the last act featuring the escape aftermath. A completely unnecessary sequence showcasing stunt motorcycling by Steve McQueen seems tagged into the screenplay?If you have a spare three hours watch this film (you probably have at some stage so enjoy it again).",10.0,Anonymous,History
The best escape movie of all times,"This is by far the best escape movie of all times and one of the classic world war movies ever. One would be hard pressed to find a better movie.

The producers of this film put together a stellar cast of actors that, if you are 35+ years old will be recognizable as top movie and television stars.  The movie itself is superb.

Not As Good For A Modern Audience,"This movie has a great story with a stunning cast that presents itself with a high level of realism. This is not a Fast Furious jump a car between high rises, type of movie.Having said that the movie has aged considerably and a modern audience will struggle to connect with the film as well as original viewers.For example the big screen iconic moment of the motorbike jump over the fence scene...(One I have always appreciated) was met with 'Is that it?' in my house by my teenage kids.

The story (based on real events) plots the coming together of key characters, planning of the escape, building of the tunnels, the escape attempts and the aftermath.It's a long but well-paced movie packed with excellent characters, iconic moments and touches of humour. While the film does portray some level of the gritty reality of war, it avoids brutal imagery to do so as indicated by the PG rating.It is simply a great story brilliantly depicted with excellent casting and direction.

Why were the Canadians not mentioned?,"It has come to my attention that the whole reason the escape happened was because of some very smart and resourceful Canadians. Yet there is no mention of Canadians in the movie. Why is that? No seriously, why were the Canadians not mentioned? If not for Canadians the Great Escape would not have happened. ""Tom, Dick and Harry"" were the making of some amazing Canadians and no one knows because the movie never mentioned them. I think this is appalling. Henry Birkland, Wally Floody and Tommy Thompson are heroes and great Canadians and I, among others, did not know their names until watching a documentary on the great escape. It is a shame that Canadians have been so downplayed in the role of winning the wars that have occurred in our past. I am a proud Canadian and the more I learn about the war and our role in them, the more I realize that Canadians have been largely unmentioned. We played a huge role in winning these wars and our soldiers deserve an honorable mention. To all our soldiers, I say thank you and god bless.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Great Steve McQueen Film,"This film deals with POW's who are sent to a new German prison camp with very tight security mainly because most of these POW's were all professional escape artists who have dug tunnels from many other German camps or simply escaped by climbing over fences and many other ways of escape. Steve MacQueen, (Capt. Hilts,) was also called ""The Cooler King"" because he always wound up in solitary confinement which was called the Cooler. James Garner, (Flight Lt. Hendley) was called the ""Scounger"" because he could obtain all kinds of necessary items in order to make escapes, like forged identification and many other items. Charles Bronson, (Flight Lt. Donny Velinski) was called the ""Tunnel King"" because he was great for making all kinds of tunnels. This film will keep you on the edge of your seat and the entire picture is not spent in the prison camp.

A Great Prison-Break film leading by McQueen,"Didn't see Shawshank Redemption yet, so it was perfect timing to watch it before the film you call it ""masterpiece"". First, I'll start judging this:The Great Escape based on a true story by Paul Brickhill, about a group of prisoners of war capturing by Nazis in one camp called POW, and they've put people who are the best what they do in one place by giving them the ability to escape the prison behind German lines. By doing so, the escape plan they initiate requires number of people to escape, forcing the Germans to look away from their lines to recatch the prisoners.First thing this film commits is both human and realism. Throughout the film, you can absorb the humanity level of every character personality in difficult and stressful situations, which is absolutely splended. It shows all the humanity individuals each character: you how cruel the person can be, how afraid the person can be and how human the person can be. It also shows the proper relationships between the people of different origins. I mean, normally, the prisoners would've fight each other to have their freedom but here, it's totally different: the British and Scottish are celebrating with Americans the 4th of July and Christmas, it's really fun to watch how the Americans the British initiating to escape the prison with hilarious and memorable moments and etc... It's also great to see the relationship between Hendley (Garner) and Blythe (Pleasence) and the relationship between Wille (Leyton) and Danny (Bronson) who struggle to survive in the oblivion as they represent their fear in the eyes of viewers.The cast ensemble was solid and each actor delivers his own performance. Steve McQueen (as Hilts ""The Cooler King"") delivers coolest and terrific performance as American pilot who messes up with the Germans authorities. The final act is masterfully piece of action as the various escapees struggle for their freedom; I think it mainly refers to the motorcycle chase scene by McQueen, of which he's trying to jump the barb fence to get to Switzerland is memorable and symbolizes tension and hope for freedom (Bravo Steve!). James Garner (as Hendley ""The Scrounger"") was excellent as a supporting member of the escape plan. The rest of the cast was spectacular: Richard Attenborough (as Barlett ""Big X""), Charles Bronson (as Danny ""Tunnel King""), James Donald (as Ramsay ""The SBO""), Donald Pleasence (as Blythe ""The Forget""), James Corbon (as Sedgwick ""Manufacture""), Hannes Messemer (as Von Luger ""The Kommandant""), David McCallum (as Ashley-Pitt ""Dispersal""), Gordon Jackson (as MacDonald ""Intelligence""), John Leyton (as Wille ""Tunnel King""), Angus Lennie (as Ives ""The Mole"") and Nigel Stock (as Cavendish ""The Surveyor""). Tbh, I stopped the film more than 5 times to get to know the movie characters better and believe me, it was not easy.John Sturges and screenwriters, James Clavell and W.R. Burnett, adapt from the book written by Paul Brickhill, who appears to be one of those prisoners of POW camp who attempted to escape, which of course is what The Great Escape is born from. Sturges touched by his story and after trying to get it onto the screen as fictional extent without failing, his vision finally succeeded, which is still enthralling new generations with each passing year. However, John manages to present in its usual way with blending elements of suspense, action and comedy and offers many pleasures and visual issues involved in every escape thread.Credit should be given either to Elmer Bernstein's score. If you can listen closely to it, it is a battle between Allied Prisoners and Germans. He does it brilliantly. I find his score as one of his best known of any film in cinema history.All in all, The Great Escape by John Struges is a tribute of old-fashioned heroism and bravery, based on real events and real men, which shows what men can accomplish under the most unusual circumstances.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"Entertaining, but superficial...","This film is well constructed and fun, but like other John Sturges films (ie: Magnificent Seven), there's never a sense that these characters are in any real danger.

Emotionless,"The Great Escape does not make the escape seem particularly great.

After watching the movie, it suddenly hit me that there were no female actors at all, which only strengthens the fact that this classic succeeded in giving a supreme plot without relying on strong sexual scenes (or violence for the matter) like so many of today's films do. The film also delivers some very excellent views at the antagonists of the story, which in turn strengthen the overall view of the main characters. Steve McQueen is brilliantly funny and remains the King of Cool (or ""King of the Cooler"" in this case!), and as always, I found myself cheering for James Coburn.

Excellent cast in rousing WWII film.,"The Great Escape is definitely one of my favorite movies. I remember seeing it at the drive-in when I was about 6. My parents always brought me a blanket so I could sleep in the back seat, but I stayed up for this one. The cast is excellent, with many memorable characters. Steve McQueen is at his peak, along with James Garner and Richard Attenborough. Based on a true story, a group of POWs from many allied nations plan a daring tunnel escape from a German camp. We see them plan, prepare, and dig the tunnels (3) as they elude detection from their captors. I have only one issue; the conditions of the camp are presented as a little too pristine, not dirty or squalid as in other POW movies like Stalag 17 or Von Ryan's Express. The prisoners here are always well fed and well groomed, with cleaned and pressed uniforms. But that can be overlooked because overall, the movie is excellent.  The actual escape is filled with suspense, and the last hour of the movie we see them on the run, by plane, train, on foot, and in McQueen's case, by motorcycle. By this time, we are rooting for each character as they all try to make it out of Germany. All in all, a WW2 epic.",,Anonymous,History
Good but overlong,"""The Great Escape"" is one of those classics that I can never remember a time when I didn't know about, or couldn't hum its indelible, cheerful score. For some reason I never watched it, perhaps due to reservations about watching older movies of this length.I was right on one count: the movie is, alas, quite a bit overlong. And surprising. You don't go into a movie as famous and as old as this one expecting surprises.The surprises come at the ending. It's not just the title that made me expect the movie would focus entirely on the escape. It's also the fact that those scenes are so engaging - if perhaps a little padded. Of particular note are the parts with Charles Bronson - dodgy Polish accent notwithstanding - and Donald Pleasence both working to escape.But when the action moves outside of the prison, the movie seriously outstays its welcome, and I was not expecting the downbeat ending - even if it does use that cheerful, unforgettable, hummable score.",7.0,Anonymous,History

If it wasn't true you'd say it's ridiculous,"The Great Escape is a fictionalized retelling of actual events. The parts that are made up are mostly peripheral, with the actual escape process staying true to fact.

The film has a fairly light tone on whole and is more about entertaining than educating. All of the humor isn't really a flaw nor does it take away anything from the film, unless you expect all films set in WWII to be like, say, Saving Private Ryan.
The picture is an ensemble of quality actors but just as their characters have a specific job that contributes to the overall mission, none of their performances are as good on their own as they are collectively viewed.The Great Escape is an unbelievable true story that is professionally executed and will capture your interest for its 173 minute runtime.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The truth about Stalag Luft III and what happened after the escape,"In point of fact, the film used one of the camp's most heroic prisoners (the Tunnel King played by Charles Bronson) as an adviser. However, the truth is there was no such character/person as Capt. Hilts. Steve McQueen's character never existed. The famed motorcycle chase in the film never happened. It is true that thousands of Germans (not ""millions"", as actor Charles Coburn later told during the film's Special Features interview) were used to track down the 76 (not 79) who escaped. Also, Hitler had initially ordered the execution of 100 prisoners, including the 76 who escaped, but was talked into executing 50, instead.One of the best sites for the truth on the various Allied POW camps and what happened to the men in these camps as the Russians and American armies advanced is found at http://www.b24.net/pow/march.htm.

Humor is something rarely seen in a war movie but director John Sturges does a great job of inserting comic relief into the film.

And, of course, there is that fantastic motorcycle chase with Steve McQueen (that didn't really happen - McQueen insisted that he had to be able to showcase his motorcycle skills or he wouldn't do the film!). Other characters were composites, but the main part of the story is close to the real events, and they used a real survivor of the camp as a technical consultant. And Donald Pleasance was eminently qualified to be POW since he was one in real life! He did say in an interview that prisoners were not as rude to heavily armed guards as in the movie - I think I would be polite to a guy with a Schmeiser submachine gun too!

War movie fans will be pleasantly surprised by this film,"Most war movie fans enjoy being thrown into the fray with a rag tag company of men, thrust into the battle, experiencing the thrill of victory, and the pain of loss: of men, a battle, etc. But what will attack these fans to this film, is the perspective of the prisoner of war. In this case, the Allied prisoner of war. Where this film diverts from many, is in the comedic aspects of the film. Some, tongue in cheek situations, that keep the pace of the film from being too serious. A wonderful, and eclectic cast of characters comprise the film, and they all seem to work well together. There isn't that awkward pairing of actors that don't play well off each other, like so many of todays Hollywood output. You have accomplished foreign actors like Richard Attenborough, and Donald Pleasance, who lend a credibility to the film. And then you have some rather brash, unpolished, but extremely talents yanks, like Steve McQueen, James Garner, Charles Bronson, and James Coburn. They have a playful quality about them, they come across as the young braggarts, a bit loose with their approach, but a nice contrast to the stiff regimen of the British army. This film uses the escape, not so much as a central focus, but rather more like a centerpiece. A thing of beauty and and great effort, but something that will oftentimes get overlooked due to the playing out of the occasion. The performances here overshadow a quite riveting story (based upon a true life happening), about a daring escape plan hatched by the allied prisoners of a German P.O.W camp. They see themselves as contributing to the war effort by creating as much chaos and havoc as possible, naturally this will be brought about with an escape of a great number of prisoners, they plan on two hundred, and the subsequent search by the German army for the escapees behind enemy lines.

How great was that escape?,"There's one thing you have to ask yourself about The Great Escape. That is whether that escape actually was so great. Was all the effort worth it? The film tells the more or less true story of British prisoners in a World War II German POW camp. The prisoners considered it their duty to try and escape, to confound and harass the enemy. But what would it take to consider the operation a success? The plan was to bust out 250 prisoners. Sounds great. But it wasn't as simple as digging a tunnel and popping up on the other side of the fence a free man. Once you exit the tunnel you're in Nazi Germany with the Gestapo hot on your heels. For all the incredibly hard work that went into the digging of the tunnel getting out of the camp was always going to be the easy part. Getting out of Germany was the hard part. And for all the meticulous planning that went into that part of the operation there was always the sense that might be a hill too high to climb. And if that effort failed the consequences would be dire. Was it all worth it? Was it really such a great escape after all?For as much as the men found it their duty to attempt to escape the fact was that they weren't really that bad off as prisoners. The camp in which they were imprisoned was not the typical Nazi house of horrors you would expect. The prisoners were actually treated pretty well. The camp commandant seemed rather sympathetic to their plight. Should they escape the Gestapo who would be responsible for hunting them down would be much less sympathetic. But escape they must decide the prisoners. And thus begins a rather incredible effort. It's so much more than digging a tunnel. Everyone had a job to do and everyone did it well. You can question whether the prisoners really should have tried to escape in the first place but there is no denying that once they set their mind to it the effort they put in was remarkable. It was always going to be an overly ambitious plan. 250 men coming out of the tunnel and finding their way to freedom? Never going to happen. What would constitute success? Everyone can have their own opinion on that. But it is hard to see how whatever could be gained was worth what in the end could be lost.So maybe the escape itself wasn't as great as we, or certainly the escapees themselves, would have hoped. But what about the movie? Again, a noble effort but not as great as you'd hope. One problem comes with Hollywood getting its hands on a true-life story and changing it to suit the needs of Hollywood. Enter Steve McQueen because an American audience demands an American star. Even if in the true story there really was no such person as McQueen's Captain Hilts. Even if in the real history all the Americans had already been moved out of the camp by the time the escape happened, let's send James Garner through the tunnel too. Garner's character at least blends into the story well. McQueen on the other hand seems to be acting in his own little movie. All the effort to give the big American star something to do, to give him some big dramatic moments detracts from the film. The character of Hilts is portrayed as the big hero. The real heroes of the story get the short shrift. Richard Attenborough, playing the leader of the escape efforts, gets plenty of screen time. But so many other characters who seemingly had a lot to offer get pushed into the background as the Steve McQueen show plays out. A shame. It's not that McQueen gives a bad performance because he surely doesn't. It's just that his character was forced into the movie and never quite fits. Not to mention the fact that all the time spent with McQueen stretches out the running time of an already notably long film. With all that went into the preparations for the escape this was always going to be a long one. Toss the character of Hilts into the mix and you've got a movie which goes on so long that it often struggles to maintain its momentum. But at least you know you have the escape to look forward to and when it comes it is undeniably dramatic. And then the tension really kicks in. What will be the ultimate fate for all of these brave men? The movie's ending packs an emotional wallop. Ultimately, and unfortunately, it comes back to McQueen. He gets the show-off motorcycle ride he demanded. And his character gets the last word so to speak. Which is a shame because the real story provided more than enough real heroes to choose from. Add it all up and this is a movie which had the potential to be great. But it comes up a few yards short.",6.0,Anonymous,History
POWerful escapism,"Little did I realise when seeing this classic film on its first broadcast on UK BBC1 on 28th December 1971 that it would be re-shown on UK TV regularly (including tonight), indeed almost incessantly for the next 4 decades and that one day I'd feel I'd know it off by heart.

It's one film I don't need to record as it's either always available somewhere and well inside my head anyway.Dozens of problem Allied prisoners are collected together by the Nazis in a Super POW camp, all their rotten eggs in one basket. Richard Attenborough playing the Big Head, sorry, Big X is determined to worry and confound the enemy by organising the escape of 250 POW's and causing a second front to be opened up within Germany looking for them all. Based on a true story the biggest niggle is only slight: the deliberate inclusion of a couple of dynamic American POW's in the film – but thankfully they were because the film would not have been seen by so many people if not. But, ultimately I'm not a POW camp expert any more than I can spot characters wearing the wrong socks or riding the wrong motorbikes – this is just wonderful entertainment. Steve McQueen plays a wild card USAAF Captain, a fabulous character from whom he could never subsequently Escape. The first half sets the scenes and characters, and organises everything with humour, the second half is gripping adventure to a memorable end/s.It's long but an awful lot happens to justify the length - personally I could cope with a six hour directors cut at the same pace! The film isn't faultless but every corny bit or stereotype is completely forgivable and essential to fully appreciating it. All in all, probably the best POW film ever made, maybe even one of the best films ever made.",9.0,Anonymous,History
10 of 10 for the genre.,"What's not to like in this star-studded, WW2 setting where escape is the relentless obsession. Heck, it's a duty for this hodgepodge of servicemen packaged like sardines in a prisoner of war camp designed to hold all the problem inmates in one place. Challenge accepted! --- Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Charles Bronson, James Garner, Richard Attenborough and Donald Pleasence are each at their best, are that's who I can name just off the top of my head. --- While it's somewhat fun and games to annoy the Germans as this Great Escape is engineered, it's only fun until it's not, because lives are on the line, odds are against them and the penalties are extreme. The realism of that detail and seriousness of situation is ever present since the script is based in real life events. For the most part it's fun movie in which you'll root for the embraceable characters to whatever end. Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Memorable Film That Was Ignored At the Oscars,"This is quite simply one of the greatest films of all time. It ranks right up there with Patton, Barry Lyndon, The Godfather, The Bridge On the River Kwai, and many other classics. It had a terrific story, riveting drama, great acting, beautiful cinematography, and a memorable score. Yet it was not nominated for Best Picture in 1964, despite the fact that the overblown and inferior ""How the West Was Won"" and ""Cleopatra"" were. Elmer Bernstein's great score was not nominated either, and no actors in the film received nominations, even though the likes of Steve McQueen, Donald Pleasance and Richard Attenborough, among others, richly deserved nominations. No, the ""Great Escape's"" only Oscar Nomination was for ""Adapted Screenplay,"" and the win went to another nominee!",10.0,Anonymous,History

It´s not a war movie,"The film shows us nothing from the brutal II world war but a true story well packed with adventure touch.  The plan for the great escape was very clever. MGM created a very good picture but the story was too long. I think it became a classic because this true story has been played very convincing by legendary stars like Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Garner, Gordon Jackson, Donald Pleasence etc. In the first part of the movie it happens not much but the the second part was full of suspense and action.

quite simply one of the best,"I love this movie more every time I see it. A perfect mix of British understatement and American pizazz. Wonderful acting throughout.While the most famous scene is certainly Steve McQueen on his motorcycle (and it is funny to know he also played one of the Germans on motorcycles, chasing himself) my own favorite scene is the tunneling - brilliant sense of claustrophobia.The scenes are very accurate - they used milk powder cans with broom handle to make scoops to dig with - and the trolleys are true to life.

Uplifting and moving WWII drama,"I've just seen back to back some of the most influential WWII war adventure movies of the 1960s, namely Where Eagles Dare, Kelly's Heroes and The Great Escape. Of these, The Great Escape is by far the most superior effort. It's a movie that presents some relatable characters, funny and touching moments, drama and tragedy, and all this based on true events (though the characters are fictional). It's an inspirational tale about a group of very different men with different talents working together for a common goal. The tone constantly shifts between comedy and tragedy, but does so in an admirable way, rarely feeling off. The film features a great ensemble cast with 'the king of cool', Steve McQueen, at the helm. It's wonderful that many of the characters are developed in a way that makes their struggles more relatable. A highlight was the unlikely friendship between James Garner's American trickster and Donald Pleasance's soft-spoken English birdwatcher characters. I also very much appreciated that for once, the Germans were not just bellowing villains, but some of them emerged as everyday people caught up in a terrible regime, characterized in a nuanced way. A movie for the ages!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Who are the extras?,"I enjoy this film and the excellent acting every time I see it. I never had looked up the cast list before as the main characters comprised an all-star cast. I must say I am a bit disappointed that the extras in the film were not given credit, and I mean mostly the two Frenchman operating the café, the three German officers who are the targeted customers, and the three French Resistance members who machine-gun the Germans in the drive-by shooting. I would appreciate having the names of these actors added to the cast list because this scene is a favorite of many viewers. As the two café workers appear to be the youngest actors in the film, it would be interesting to know if they still are alive.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Something not often noted,"This film may have its detractors, but I am not one of them.  I saw it first in 1963 when I was a graduate student in Germany.  What stood out then in everyone's mind was that it was absolutely true to its time and location. The German actors were indeed German, and not all of them were portrayed unsympathetically.  Anyone traveling through Germany at that time would see many sections of the larger cities that remained in ruins.  Yet there was evident a popular feeling that the country had largely been reborn and had rejoined the mainstream of European life and culture, as had Italy and other formerly fascist states.Films made shortly after (say, 1948 to 1965) and about about World War II in Europe, whether they were entirely fictional or based on fragments of fact -- as was this one -- seem always to have been either very good or very bad at portraying history within their own internal contexts.  This one belongs among the former, together with ""The Third Man "" ""Battleground,"" ""The Devil Makes Three,"" and -- yes -- ""The Sound of Music.""  The contrast with truly awful stuff like the television comedy ""Hogan's Heroes"" or action pix like ""Guns of Navarone"" or tendentious stuff like ""The Night Porter"" is sharp and painful to anyone sensitive to broader historical truths.Comments on artistic value and style aside, great movies based on recent history are in part great because they reflect those truths. More fanciful images that distort reality may be chic, but I tend not to value them very highly.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Engrossing, well-acted, saga of the human spirit","""The Great Escape"" is an engrossing, well-acted, and fairly accurate portrayal of the famous escape of some 76 Allied POWs from a German Stalag during World War II.  You get to see the intricate detail of the escape operation--and you also get to witness its bittersweet aftermath.Good, often understated, ensemble acting by what was for the 1960's an all-star cast, adds further to the sense of realism.  In particular, Donald Pleasance poignantly plays a POW who gives his all to make the mass escape succeed, but then realizes he can't go himself because he's going blind.But ""The Great Escape"" is more than just an exciting adventure story.  It also reminds us of several important things about the human condition: Human beings need to be free, as much as they need food and water.  And they will struggle against enormous odds to gain their freedom.  But freedom never comes cheap.  The Allied POWs succeed in breaking out of the Stalag and dashing across Germany, in hopes of reaching a neutral country.  But, as it turns out, at a very high price.",,Anonymous,History
Dated,"This is 2005, more than forty years after the movie was made. I would say the major difference between this and modern films is the way the prisoner of war camp seemed to be more like a cheap motel, with lots of privacy for the prisoners, seemingly pretty nice Germans in charge (granted, they were wearing blue, so it may have been a WWII Grand Illusion interplay), easy to get supplies for the escape. But everything was just too easy, again something of the sixties films. The movie was really about temperamental conflicts while building the tunnel, but these were based on stereotypes of characters, not real emotional differences. But, it's a classic, so I watched more of it than I really should have.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Epic escape movie,"This movie is based on real life story . For dramatic purposes some things were changed , yet it isn't a complete fiction . The movie manages to be both entertainment and a honest tribute to the real-life prisoners.The cast includes stars like Steve McQueen , James Gardner , Charles Bronson , Richard Attenbourgh and James Coburn. No Oscar worthy performances here , but more than solid team work makes it a pleasure to watch . Each character has got it's own personality and is memorable. The dialogues are full with sly sense of humor (""There's a madness in this method"" , ""I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard"") . The whole movie is full of gentle and effective humor ( for example McQueen and stolen keys , McQueen and potatoes) . The screenplay is good , with believable and clever solutions to problems of prisoners (What to do with the sand ? ) .This movie is a war comedy , yet it has a heart. The movie becomes more and more serious the closer the end . Unlike most of today's Hollywood movies the drama here is connected with the comedy completely naturally.""The Great escape"" isn't a depressing drama , but it never forgets about the humanity of it's heroes . There is fear , loss and paranoia here too. There are two really heartbreaking scenes here – the motorbike chase and the sacrifice of one of the prisoners . In the end the movie asks important question – was it worth it ? It REALLY depends on your point of view.A true classic. Epic in it's length (2 hours 42 minutes) , yet never boring .

Great escapism!,"Despite a nearly three-hour running-time, a plot taken from a real-life event deemed a failure and a tragedy, a direction from no-nonsense John Sturges, plus an all-male cast of actors not known for their levity, ""The Great Escape"" is indeed great escapism: light on its feet and entertaining the whole way through. Allied soldiers in 1942 are captured by the Germans and imprisoned in a work camp...but, like the man said, it's a good soldier's duty to try and escape, though many of these POW's have tried before and keep failing. The film's first hour nimbly introduces us to the characters and puts their plan to tunnel out of the camp immediately into motion; the second hour is the work involved in pulling off their plan (keeping suspicions at bay by creating diversions, stealing the proper materials); while the third act is the escape (for some) and its aftermath. Adapted from Paul Brickhill's book by James Clavell and W. R. Burnett, ""The Great Escape"" isn't brilliant, though it's certainly clever. It's laid out for us in simple terms, and the men are simply what they are: the Captain, ""The Scrounger"", ""The Forger"", the RAF Officer, ""The Tunnel King"" (who gets claustrophobia), ""The Manufacturer"" (men who can be whittled right down to their nicknames without us missing a beat). Steve McQueen has a running bit being sent to The Cooler (isolation) which is funny, though it leaves him without a lot to do in the film's midsection (a point of contention between the actor and Sturges). Otherwise, the best performances are turned in by Donald Pleasence (and James Garner whenever the two share the screen together), Richard Attenborough and a surprisingly low-keyed Hannes Messemer as ""The Kommandant"". *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,History
Deserves it's popularity,"I wouldn't have given a review if I hadn't read a certain review from one of the previous reviewers.  It's funny that the certain reviewer described ""The Great Escape"" as an example of Hollywood fluff and then recommends ""Saving Private Ryan"".  I don't want to say anything bad about 'Saving Private Ryan' because I consider it a masterful, realistic piece of modern cinema but it does suffer from perhaps the cheesiest dialogue ever for a modern film. Unnecessary Speeches and unintentionally comical moments (such as several 'helmet' scenes in the middle of the 'Invasion' sequence) prevents 'Saving Private Ryan' from becoming a timeless classic.""The Great Escape"", which was released in 1963 may seem dated by today's and future standards but is nevertheless a joy to watch and definitely has a proper sense of dread for a war film.  We must realize that a movie, whether based on real life or fiction, should be entertaining.  If some uninvolving facts have to be altered for entertainment, then it has be done just as long as what is important is put to use (In this movie's case, the hope that one day they will escape).  If a movie doesn't entertain, does it have much of an impact?The characters' involvement with each other is remarkable considering how many of them are there.  From the ways prisoners deal with each other, to the German Military and the Gestapo, it was an amazing feat for the cast and crew.

A Truly Great Movie,"The Great Escape is undoubtedly the finest war/prison movie ever made. Directed by John Sturges,whose film credits include Bad Day at Black Rock (1955), Gunfight at the OK Corral (1957), The Magnificent Seven (1960) and Ice Station Zebra (1968). In World War II,Mr. Sturges made documentaries and training films while enlisted in the US Army Air Corps. His exhaustive research and attention to detail are certainly on display in this film. Because of his success with The Magnificent Seven,he was able to convince MGM to undertake this monumental project. After much negotiations, he was able to convince his star from The Magnificent Seven, Steve McQueen,to come aboard for this film. McQueen was reluctant to do another war movie, and only accepted the part if a motorcycle chase was wrote in exclusively for him. Sturges agreed, and the chase toward the end of the movie became one of the signature highlights of the film. A little known fact is that during the chase McQueen, through the magic of editing, was also used as one of the German motorcycle riders,thereby creating the unique circumstance of McQueen being pursued by himself during the chase scene! An all-star collection of American and British actors, McQueen as Hilts,the Cooler King, James Garner as the Scrounger,Richard Attenborough as Big X, Charles Bronson as the Tunnel King, James Coburn as the Manufacturer and Donald Pleasance as the Forger,to name a few.Thrown together in the German prison camp Stalag Luft III, the Air Force prisoners use their creative talents to dig three tunnels( Tom,Dick & Harry) and get as many men out as quickly as possible, and to create as much confusion for the German SS as they can in trying to find and recapture them. Based on a true story, this film combines the components of suspense, ingenuity, adventure and the triumph of the human spirit to attain freedom no matter the cost.

One of my favorite movies,"The Great Escape is not the best movie, the best war movie or the most accurate. Its the most entertaining. I saw it when it came out any many times thereafter. It's a movie Hollywood was meant to make.In it's own way, by entertaining us, it enables some emotion or understanding of WWII so we can comprehend what happened. Our fathers and grandfathers could have been there, it was a matter of chance. Had they, we're sure that's how they would have acted. That's how we would have wanted them to be and some were.All the character are portrayed larger than life, just as we envision they must have been regardless of who they actually were or which prison camp. Ordinary people, but to us extraordinary. Each character is presented to reinforce impressions we already have in our mind.Although the movie is ultimately about terrible events and the grim fate awaiting some of the escapees, we are comforted by the thought that men like them actually existed. We take great pleasure in their discipline, maturity, unity and self reliance, exhilaration in their escape, panic in their arrest, shock and horror in their demise.We want to watch it over again to relive those feeling. We are being entertained by the high drama of events as we become part of them. Seldom does Hollywood get the right combination of mood, story, actors and direction.From another point of view, Saving Private Ryan is a far better movie in virtually every way, but I have only seen it once and have desire or need to see it again. It is one of the great movies, incredibly accurate and realistic, but does not make me feel the same way as The Great Escape. I cringe.Saving Private Ryan is about how we fought, gritty, bloody, morally and emotionally chaotic, kill or be killed. The Great Escape is about why we fought. No prisoner in The Great Escape even had a weapon. War without weapons, a story only Hollywood could properly tell.

"Sturges, McQueen and Co. at their best.","This Film should stir the passions of those that have an affinity with War Movies, with it's telling of the struggle for life and, freedom in one of Germany's P.O.W. Camps in the Second World War. It's not factually correct, some items in Paul Brickhill's book which the film was adapted from were ignored or glossed over, and other events in the Movie which had little to do with actual happenings in the Compound were added by Hollywood, and it's mandatory penchant to entertain. Who cares!! The Great Escape is a great Movie, superbly directed by John Sturges who also skillfully gleaned the best out of the many Stars he had around him at the time and on the payroll. Certainly he was responsible in helping Steve McQueen perform one of his best screen roles as Captain Virgil Hilts, the gung-ho Airman delighting in upsetting his captors who took their work far too seriously, continually asking the mischievous one to spend time in their Cooler. Sturges manages also to capture the many nationalistic traits of the men in the Prison, showing us the stiff upper lip of the British chaps, the laconic Aussie, played brilliantly by James Coburn, the smooth talking American scrounger played by James Garner,the fierce independence of one of the tunnel diggers Danny Velinski, played by Charles Bronson and, of course the Camp Kommandant, Von Luger, ( Hannes Messemer ) expressing typical German efficiency but, perhaps wishing like his prisoners he'd rather be somewhere else. Elmer Bernstein's music also played it's part in making the Movie the success it is, with different mood and tone attached to pivotal scenes such as the opening sequences, the building of the tunnels and eventual escape, and the final stages of the show when we see the lucky ones on their home run.

The Great Escape is one of the all-time great movies.,"Based on a true story from WW2 ""The Great Escape"" is in just about everyone's list of favourite movies. Taken purely as escapist entertainment (if you will pardon an obvious pun), it is a very tough act to follow & the decision taken by its producers to fill it chock full of top-of-the-range film stars certainly paid off in spades. Steve McQueen will always be remembered for his iconic motor-cycle stunt-riding later in the film but there were many other memorable moments in the film. Trying to pick holes in this movie is churlish but I found it difficult to buy that Charles Bronson (tunnel king Danny) could suffer a serious attack of claustrophobia during the actual escape, even though i do understand it was done for dramatic effect. Genial James Garner (scrounger) always seemed to enhance anything he was ever involved in & was, as ever, great. Same goes for Richard Attenborough (big ""x"" the organiser), James Coburn (manufacturer), David McCallum (soil dispersal) & Donald Pleasance (forger). German actor Hannes Messemer was also great in his role as Von Luger the camp commandant. I must have seen this film at least 20 or 30 times (probably more than any other) but I still love it.

Good film about POW's,"Good film about POW's - the Germans are going to have to implement an enormous amount of manpower to recapture them, then ideally they would simply take no prisoners, but such actions are against the Geneva convention. Even so, for all of their brutality, it is surprising that the Nazi's did actually take prisoners. The conclusion to the conversation is that the commandant wants the prisoners to comply but because the prisoners are the enemy then it is their duty to escape. I liked the movie: it was tense but it was also funny. Steve McQueen's character was the one that added a lot of life to the movie. He was the one that came up with all of the bright ideas to escape, and the one that was always caught and put into the cooler. He actually seemed to spend more time in the cooler than out of it....the movie also portrayed the brutality of the Germans. Even though they did seem to look after the prisoners of War, the ones that continually escaped were simply gunned down by the Gestapo. They had become sick of this escaping POW's so they warned them that if they were caught again then they would be shot. The Gestapo made that promise and they kept it. It still seems very harsh, but this was a war and no matter what the Geneva convention says, there is no rules in war and the allies were just as brutal as the German's were.The movie was tense especially in the scene where they discover the tunnel, and even when they are escaping and people begin to panic.

The Great Escape,"Title: The Great Escape (1963)
Director: John Sturges
Genre: War, Drama, Adventure
The Great Escape is an iconic war film that tells the incredible true story of a group of Allied prisoners of war during World War II. Directed by John Sturges, this 1963 classic has become a timeless masterpiece and remains one of the most beloved films in the genre.The movie follows a group of British and American soldiers who are held captive in a high-security German prison camp. Determined to regain their freedom, they plan an audacious escape attempt. Led by Squadron Leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough), known as ""Big X,"" they meticulously devise an elaborate plan to break out of the seemingly impenetrable prison walls.One of the standout aspects of The Great Escape is its ensemble cast, featuring some of Hollywood's finest actors at the time. Steve McQueen delivers a charismatic performance as Captain Virgil Hilts, famously known for his thrilling motorcycle chase scene. James Garner portrays Lieutenant Robert Hendley, adding depth and humor to the narrative. Each character brings a unique personality and skill set to contribute to their shared objective.The film excels in capturing both the camaraderie among the POWs and their relentless determination to reclaim their freedom. It beautifully balances moments of suspense with lighter comedic scenes that provide much-needed relief amidst the tense atmosphere.John Sturges' direction deserves special mention for his ability to create tension-filled sequences without resorting to excessive violence or gore commonly associated with war films. Instead, he focuses on building suspense through meticulous planning and execution while highlighting themes such as loyalty, sacrifice, and resilience.Furthermore, The Great Escape boasts impressive production design that transports viewers back in time to WWII-era Germany. From detailed recreations of the prison camp itself to authentic costumes and props, every element adds authenticity and immersion to the story.While some may argue that the film's runtime of over two and a half hours is excessive, it allows for thorough character development and an immersive storytelling experience. The pacing remains consistent throughout, keeping viewers engaged from start to finish.In conclusion, The Great Escape is a timeless war film that continues to captivate audiences with its thrilling story, memorable characters, and superb performances. It successfully manages to balance action-packed sequences with moments of heartwarming camaraderie. If you're a fan of war films or simply appreciate well-crafted storytelling, The Great Escape is definitely worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,History

We Root For The Heros To Victory,"THE GREAT ESCAPE ***** If ever there was a movie where the viewer roots for the heroic characters to victory, it would be 'The Great Escape'. Memorably created based on the true event, it's setting is in Germany at a concentration camp during the Second World War, where Allied soldiers are held and monitored very carefully by The Nazis. The story begins with the captive soldiers grouping together to carry out a plan of escape - that is, 'The Great Escape'. The tactics involved are engineered by three of the soldiers: the Master of Intelligence (Richard Attenborough) and assistants Steve McQuinn and James Garner. They build an underground tunnel that travels past the vicinity of the camp, and even though some of the heroes escape, what the viewer discovers is that fleeing from the prison is one thing, but evading all of the German soldiers throughout the country from which point is another thing! While the introduction contributes comic humor, the second and third act features excellent suspense. This is a definite renown classic with a winning ensemble cast, solid scripting, good score from Elmer Bernstein, and particularly memorable supporting appearances by Donald Pleasance and Angus Lennie.",,Anonymous,History

Kick-ass escape movie,"Accomplished cast in engrossing story of major break-out from German prison camp in World War II. Based on true-life story of Roger Bushell (Roger Bartlett in the movie), with some extra thrills and characters thrown in ala Hollywood. The book by Brickhill is as good as, if not better than, the movie; the book was followed by a sequel where Brickhill tried to track down the perpetrators of the post-escape massacre (some of whom, if I recall, had vanished behind the Iron Curtain). Ignore the comment above - this escape drew so many resources and caused so much disruption in Nazi Germany that Hitler personally ordered all the escapees shot, so ""how many people completed their escape"" misses the point. Relatively fast pace of film and thoroughly fine acting make up for long running time. Worth watching just for the scenes involving McQueen (reportedly a handful on the set), a real-life motorcyclist who performed his own stunts and some of the Germans' as well. A solid 10, deservedly in the IMDb top 100 with a powerful Elmer Bernstein score.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Good film classic,"Good film classic. So while waiting for their garden to reap a harvest, they all decide to tunnel out of the place. The tunnel is discovered, but they still have two other ones they're working on so they continue on, even though there are the problems of the forger losing his sight, and one of the tunnel diggers being claustrophobic. They dig out but find themselves 30 feet short of the forest they were going to escape into and the Germans pick up their trail. 3 POW's make it out, 23 are captured and returned to the camp and the remaining 50 are executed. Based on a true story ( with some factual errors, and influenced by Jean Renoir's 1937 film, Grand Illusion ), this film moves very quickly with an adventureous pace and well acted roles, particularly Steve McQueen as the American motorcycling hotshot, Richard Attenbourough as the escape team head.",7.0,Anonymous,History
No rescue needed!,"The Great Escape (1963) -Despite its subject matter this film was actually really enjoyable, with most of the harsher elements of Prison Of War camps seemingly cut out. It's certainly not as hard to watch as the more recent effort 'Unbroken' (2014) and the classic 'The Bridge On The River Kwai' (1957) or the concentration camp films, which haunt me, 'Schindler's List' (1993), 'The Pianist' (2002) and 'The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas' (2008) to name but a few.Apart from the fact that it may not be entirely or historically accurate, there's not really a lot to criticise about this one as s piece of entertainment. It's just a good film, that's easy to watch and filled with some great actors. Personally, I think that it's Dickie Attenborough's best performance that I've seen and Mr. McQueen was a nice bit of light relief from all of the more serious Brits.I liked the spunk that they all had. Their determination in the face of it all was admirable and in a way it made me proud of our boys, despite having never really understood soldiering or war.And I'd never considered that escape attempts were a soldiers duty to cause enemy troops to be diverted before, but it made sense when it was explained that governing and providing resources for a prison would be a huge exhaustion of manpower and supplies that could have been allocated elsewhere.I'm not sure however, that the punishments would have been as gentle as those shown?It really did seem like a slightly glossier version of what I would have expected based on the other films of a similar ilk, that have shown how awful the various camps could be, but it was based on a factual account, so it can't be too far off from the truth I suppose.The tension was palpable as the escape attempt was made. I felt almost as claustrophobic and panicked as Charles Bronson during the tunnel scenes and I was willing them all home.I was reminded however of the Eddie Izzard sketch about this film, which if you haven't seen is definitely worth a watch, because I can't explain why it works so well, without spoiling it.My one criticism really was that Ives, an actual Scots man sounded so false. His accent was positively 'Groundskeeper Willy' in its delivery.To wrap it up I would say that it's easy to see why 'The Great Escape' has become such staple viewing at Christmas and regarded so highly in general. It made watching a prisoner of war film bearable and in a lot of ways fun, like watching young lads planning and building a tree house or den. Usually factual inaccuracies and shiny versions of things would annoy me, but this one had a formula that worked.736.03/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Overrated, ridiculous and disappointing",The first half of the movie is like a 2 hour long episode of Hogans Heroes. The tone is so lighthearted and silly that it's ridiculous. The prisoners wander around doing whatever they want and the Germans are made to look like complete fools. The tone of the second half is a bit better and you actually get the sense that the POW's may be in some danger. The character development is non-existent as well. Really surprised this is so highly rated. I can only speculate that it is nostalgia.,5.0,Anonymous,History
Adventure and escape,"One of the great adventure movies is about an escape from a German POW camp in the middle of World War II where most of the characters end up dead, murdered by the SS. Fun, right?It's both a great irony and a testament to John Sturges' sure hand on the material that a story so inherently depressing doesn't come off that way. That the tone of the film manages to move from one extreme to another without feeling like whiplash is kind of amazing, and I think it all has to do with the general approach to the material that gets established from the beginning. The first twenty minutes or so establishes a sense of danger for the situation at the prison camp as a whole but populates it with a bevy of characters who refuse to be defeated. They're looking for ways out the second the arrive, scoping out blind spots on the wire that surrounds the camp, sneaking into a group of Russian prisoners that are being moved out, and jumping into trucks filled with the last of tree branches from the surrounding forest in an effort to escape. It's that spirit of determinism and refusal to bow to the reality at hand that they are trapped in a cage for the duration of the war that makes the movie work as well as it does in the face of the grim realities that it presents.The movie revolves around one concentrated attempt at escape in a prisoner of war camp, built exclusively to hold the most notorious of prisoners who have repeated escapes on their record, putting all of Germany's rotten eggs in one basket. The group of Brits, Australians, Scots, and Americans get roles to play from scrounging for supplies to forging to tailoring to tunneling. The tunneling is key, of course, because it represents the best way to get out two hundred fifty prisoners at once to confound the enemy from behind the lines, forcing them to dedicate resources away from the front lines.The task pits two intelligent adversaries against each other, and milling throughout are a series of personalities that play their parts in one capacity or another. It's a men on a mission film where the mission is to escape and confound, not to destroy a particular objective or win the war. With that in mind, the movie's resolution, where it ends with the murder of fifty escaped prisoners of war by the Nazi regime, tired of the efforts to keep these men caged, the movie's overall effect and tone suddenly make more sense. Escape back home wasn't the primary goal, winning a small battle over the Nazis to get them to redirect resources was.The joys of the film really come from the characters and actors, though. The three-hour film has a lot of time to fill in telling this specific, really focused story, and in order to inform each scene with more than just a plot based reason for existence, characters end up feeling alive as they work with each other and sometimes against each other in pursuit of their mutual goals. James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, Donald Pleasence, James Donald, and in particular Steve McQueen bring appropriate ease, suave, or gravitas to their roles. McQueen's role as Hilts is obviously the one most people remember, for it was what turned McQueen into a super star, but it's Pleasence as Blythe, the Forger, that I've always loved the most. His sad fall into complete reliance on James Garner's Hendley, the Scrounger, has always felt like the most emotionally touching part of the film.John Sturges has a very strong handle on the material, having nursed it in his mind based on the source material, an account written by a former prisoner of war of the real Great Escape. He manages to balance the bevy of characters, giving each one time to feel unique and alive on their own, while also keeping all major aspects of the escape plan in clear view. The fact that there is no one large portion of the escape that feels unexplained all while the movie is able to never feel bogged down in the details is a testament to how assured a hand Sturges had on the film. And, of course, there should be mention of Elmer Bernstein whose score compliments the film so wonderfully while being a fun piece of music on its own.The Great Escape is a grand adventure that remains emotional genuine in the face of a lot of fictionalization of events. It keeps its feel of fun adventure while balancing it against the real tragedy that ends the film deftly. It's a classic for a reason.",10.0,Anonymous,History

It is great entertainment. But that is where it ends.With a huge cast of major actor names, it was sure to bring in the cinema crowds on release. And that it did. It is one of the ultimate war classic movies that came out of the 1950's-60's.I decided not to add to the movie goofs because they are so many.

Great Movie,"In this movie, we have proof that it is very possible to make an excellent war movie without the gratuitous violence or language that is present in so many other WWII-set movies. Steve Mcqueen is unbelievably good as Hilts, and the script is written in a historically accurate way that puts other war movies to shame. Interestingly, another movie that I very much enjoyed starring Mcqueen, Papillon, has a very similar plot. Also, if you enjoyed the cast of The Great Escape, I would highly recommend The Magnificent Seven. It has absolutely nothing to do with WWII (it's a western), but, ironically, it has 6-8 of the same actors from The Great Escape playing major roles. Although Mcqueen is regretfully not present, this is another very well-acted movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History

An almost great film,"The Great Escape has all the elements needed for a great Hollywood film, but it falls short of perfection.  The acting, direction, photography, and especially the music are all compelling, but the script comes up short.  It is very difficult to believe that prisoners of war would constantly be so cavalier about everything.  The film creates a bunch of fun but ultimately trivial characters that inhabit an all-too-unreal prison camp.  While they cover slightly different ground, Grand Illusion and Stalag 17 both are superior films for presenting a more balanced view of prison life.  In spite of the poor script and silly characterizations, the film does have many merits.  The European locations are wonderful and look fantastic.  The score is riveting.  And the cast provides an informative glimpse into Hollywood, 1963.  This is one of the last great studio action films.  Soon, films that some of the stars of this film are in, like Bullit and Death Wish, would replace the WWII film as the action/adventure standard.  The world was moving forward, away from the patriotism and myth that surrounded the second war.  The great legacy of this film is that it provides one last look back into that lost world and shows why it was so compelling to Americans.  Soon after the film's release, JFK would be dead and Vietnam would be reality. The Great Escape could not have been made in 1969.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Sporadic but oddly intriguing film set amidst an Allied prisoner of war camp; an unnerving but effective meshing of the horrors of war with rabid, punchy entertainment.","For the most part, The Great Escape is a romping and rather enjoyable Second World War film about working together; being brave; overcoming a predicament and escaping. If it means thwarting the Nazis in the process then so be it. It plays out under a banner of surprisingly upbeat, somewhat comical, borderline happy-go-lucky entertainment – it seems most of the characters held within the prisoner of war camp, which we spend most of the film's runtime within, are quite enjoying trying to escape; frustrating the Nazi officials; repeatedly risking their lives and, oddest of all, spending time in a small concrete six by four hole which is named 'The Cooler'. War films demand conflict, and they usually demand a certain sense of action spectacle which, handled, correctly doubles up as the film's bloody and unappealing warfare; The Great Escape appears to want to have it every other which way. Here is a war film that has so much fun for its first hour and a half that when the time comes for its character to bolt for the blue, it isn't sure how to deal with some of their expeditions into the wider unknown and flits uncontrollably from ups to downs, morphing its atmosphere rather uncontrollably from terror to tragedy to excitement to relief and then back again.We begin with a procession of trucks and vehicles transporting Allied prisoners to an isolated camp in rural Germany during World War 2. Over the credits they travel, journeying deeper and deeper into the forests; across the roads and over the hills until that sense of being deep into the middle of absolutely nowhere is effectively established. The measure of how far the prisoners whom we focus on go, from arriving at the camp to doing what they do, is effectively established when they step out of the trucks upon arrival: they're bleary eyed rabble of a bunch, a little lost in their new surroundings and not entirely together yet 'as one'. The following scene sees a British officer speak to the camp's leader; the German towering over him as he stands instead of sitting and lays out the rules, the officer's leg based injury a further establishment of the superiority he has in comparison. The dialogue shot in profile so as to get across the degrees of conflict between them but then somewhat such a composition relinquished when middle ground is reached and immediate conflict dissipates through agreement, even if it is retained in essence.The camp itself is the Germans placing of all those whom are guilty of repeated escape attempts from other camps into one big camp that they believe is capable of holding all of them. Once out, it's always inferred neutral Switzerland is the place to head toward; the powers that be seemingly counteracting this by having the camp far away enough that a fighter plane voyage won't get you across the border. So as to engulf the widest possible audience for the film, we come to revolve around an array of men from an array of backgrounds of an array of different nationalities. An amusing scene early on highlights the clashing of these cultures, backgrounds and attitudes; an American more broadly representative of most of the film's Americans speaks to a British character, again posing as a broader representation of people of his nationality, about how hunting and shooting birds rather than sketching them and that riding motorcycles instead of your more bog-standard, boring even, bicycles is more preferable in either case.Of the film's Americans, Steve McQueen's captain named Virgil Hilts is a man continuously pushing the boundaries of what the Germans might tolerate, a young rebellious sort whom later adopts the mantle of the film's lead action man. Regarding the British, Richard Attenborough's Roger Bartlett is granted a separate arrival to that of everybody else complete with S.S. escort, his expertise in escaping from camps built up through other's dialogue whilst he's off screen whereas Donald Pleasence's Flight lieutenant named Colin Blythe, a man who's a dab hand at forging whatever need forging in what is itself a skill which requires precision and patience, is a more heartwarming presence as he himself undergoes his own subplots to do with health and friendships with another inmate. With an array of supporting acts, none of whom in the form of Scottish; Polish or Australian prisoners match up to the strength in ability and smarts as the English or Americans, the Pole of whom later needs his hand practically held so as to get through the tough stuff to freedom, the film uses the premise to tell a true story in a relatively interesting manner of how several men broke out of a POW fortress.The film is a fairly engaging piece for the best part, its stuff to do with character done and dusted by the time the planning and executing of several escape attempts plays out; Hilts' early attempt to just go for it thwarted with ease establishing a sense that time and due care is almost certainly required. The film isn't concerned as much about plot as it is with telling a tale of how something happened, in a somewhat precise manner which has the film all too annoyingly resemble that of a montage in doing one thing; planning the next stage and fulfilling that bit – sometimes it works, others it doesn't and they have to take a step backwards. On occasion, the flag waving in that the Americans bail the Brits out on occasion is tiresome; James Garner's Lieutenant Hendley aiding Blythe at the risk of his own expense as well as Hilt's sacrifices early on so as to aid Bartlett in their tunnel digging a tad odd. Regardless, director John Sturges keeps the film moving; and while the 172 minutes do fly past fairly quickly whilst we're stuck in this prison, that fact is more of an achievement than the film is as a whole actually is.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Not such a great escape,"Loosely based on the true story of 70-odd American, British, and other allied prisoners of war who escaped from jail to deliberately throw confusion on Germany and divert troops from the front lines.  Top cast of character actors makes the most of all the scenes and the action is good, so one doesn't tend to notice the film's excessive length too much.  Lots of thought went into making the film relatively inoffensive to the European market, even including sympathetic Germans and courageous Frenchmen, cheapening the film's realism.",5.0,Anonymous,History
When suspenseful and true negate dramatic and emotional in the war genre,"As far as war films go, ""The Great Escape"" doesn't rank in the most dramatic or the most eye-opening. It doesn't even make the list of World War II epics with the most compelling characters. It's a movie with that intangible ""it"" factor that only comes from an impressive story. Films such as this one that are based on true events and real-life people (many of whom were acted by people with similar war experience), are the reason so many ""based on a true story"" movies have been made over the years.""The Great Escape"" will have its skeptics because director John Sturges' approach to the film emphasizes suspense ahead of character development, which usually characterizes fiction. With a background in westerns, Sturges knows how to build up to and then milk the climactic scenes. The reason the final hour with the prisoners escaping is so good is because it took nearly two hours to get there. It certainly didn't help the film's credibility to have Steve McQueen demanding to ""do more"" in the film and insist on riding a motorcycle, but many remember ""The Great Escape"" for this reason.The true elements of the story come from an actual escape attempt by Allied POWs from a German stalag. Paul Brickhill, who wrote the book upon which the film is based, actually assisted in planning a tunneling effort. That should put to rest any questions about the film's validity. Undoubtedly characters were created by mashing together multiple real-life persons and their fates did not match exactly what happened to them in reality (who could know?), but this was no cheap Hollywood attempt to exploit a terrific true story. After all, the ending is certainly more akin to a war drama than entertaining historical fiction.Sturges calls upon many of the stars from ""The Magnificent Seven"" (released three years before this one) to assist him in this film: Steve McQueen as the leader figure notorious for getting in trouble and ending up in ""the cooler"" or isolation, Charles Bronson as Danny the lead tunneler who ironically is claustrophobic and James Coburn as Louis ""The Manufacturer."" Other notable stars are acclaimed actor/director Richard Attenborough, future James Bond villain Donald Pleasence and James Garner. What their characters lack in depth written into the script, these fine actors inject back into their roles as best they can.""The Great Escape"" takes a bit too long to get to the climax so clearly spelled out by the title, but the wait is worth it. The first hour and a half to two hours plays out as a series of episodes showing the preparations and the characters behind them, some more effective than others, but the movie earns its place in war film history with the final act. As these characters flee the prison, you start to realize how much you do indeed care about what happens to them.There's so much suspense inherent in the story and written into the script that a dramatically adept director could've made ""The Great Escape"" a monumental film, but thrilling and unique are acceptable adjectives when all is said and done, even if they could have been arrived at a tad bit quicker. After all, much of what there is to marvel at this film about has to do with its fascinatingly true story.~Steven Chttp://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,History
I'm sure you'll dig it.,"Continuing my quest to re-watch every film I saw during my Christmas holidays as a youth, I now arrive at The Great Escape, a staple of festive scheduling on UK television for many years. From the rousing Elmer Bernstein score, which blares out over the opening titles, to the emotional ending, this is the perfect film to digest a turkey dinner over, a 172 minute star-studded true story of incredible heroism guaranteed to stir the blood (unless you're German) and thoroughly deserving of the adjective 'Great'.A testament to the indomitable spirit of man, the film tells of how the inmates of a German WWII Prisoner of War camp planned and executed a daring escape, digging three tunnels, which they dubbed Tom, Dick and Harry. After months of careful planning, this bold bid for freedom resulted in over seventy prisoners successfully fleeing the camp. Only a handful ultimately made it to freedom, but the sheer ingenuity and bravery involved was staggering (despite seeming far-fetched, the events that occur on-screen are apparently accurate). Superb direction from John Sturges and a brilliant cast ensure that the viewer genuinely cares for the colourful characters, which only goes to make their post-escape exploits all the more nail-biting.Highly recommended, even if, like me, you're not a big war film fan.",9.0,Anonymous,History
The Great Escape is A Great Deal of Fun And - In Itself - A Kind Of Escape!,"At a Luftwaffe-run high-security WWII prison camp somewhere in Germany, a group of Allied officers plot one of the most inordinately ambitious escape attempts ever hatched. Not just a dozen or two, but 250 men are planning to escape. Each man contributes his expertise. British Squadron leader Roger Bartlett (Richard Attenborough) nicknamed Big X designs the plan, which involves digging three tunnels at once with Charles Bronson as the ""chief digger"", despite his lifelong claustrophobia. James Coburn is the ""manufacturer,"" who invents a way to keep air flowing through the tunnels. James Garner plays the ""scrounger"", whose job is to get a hold of things like picks and shovels as well as ID badges and documents. Donald Pleasance is a ""forger"" who prepares the fake documents the prisoners will need once they escape. Finally, we have Steve McQueen playing Hilts, who spends most of his time in the cooler, bouncing his baseball against the wall and is ready to go through the tunnel to get important information, and then allow himself to be recaptured so he can give them the information.With its luxurious three hours, The Great Escape deliberately details all the ins and outs, the successes and pitfalls of the plan. We learn how the diggers get rid of the excess dirt. We learn where the wood comes from to brace the tunnels. We see how the scrounger makes friends with - and double-crosses - the guards to get what he wants from the outside. The escape itself occurs in the middle of the film, and the way it is shot is absolutely gripping. The cast is a cavalcade of tough guys from 1960, offering a fantastic ensemble - a punchy cast with the moxy you'd expect from a group of officers trying to buck the system.Unlike other prison camp movies, it does not dwell on disputes between prisoners or on the deprivations, which seems almost comfortable. The story gives us an exceptional example of professionalism, courage, resourcefulness, teamwork, and loyalty of every one of the prisoners. But, it is not one bit preachy. It is in fact, an absurdly fun movie to watch: it says very little about the human condition but it doesn't ever sag for long enough to let you notice that fact. John Sturges' genius is that he presents each detail of the plan with all the excitement of a major set-piece: he understands the human tendency towards curiosity in how things work and rewards it by lingering over every step in the process. Elmer Bernstein's exemplary score helps a great deal. He lays on the dread when Sturges forgets about it, and ramps up the suspense when necessary with a rollicking, jingoistic collection of iconic marches and leitmotifs that give the film a bouncy momentum that carries us through.It is, when all is said and done, a mechanical film: but god, what a beautiful machine!",9.0,Anonymous,History

Never Give Up,"The Great Escape has a runtime of 172 minutes, and the story has you hooked for every single one of them. From the outset the concept of Stalag Luft III is pitched to the viewer - a camp built especially for prisoners who have a proven aptitude in escapism; all the Luftwaffe's ""rotten eggs in one basket"". From here on in the plot wastes no time in getting to business, and the resourcefulness and willpower shown by our main characters throughout is captivating. From what I've read, the events depicted are fairly historically accurate and I find that amazing. By the time the iconic theme music plays at the film's close I had laughed, cried, fallen off my seat, and everything in between. Overall The Great Escape left me with an important message, best epitomised by Steve McQueen (The Cooler King) in the final scene - never, ever give up.If I had to give one criticism of the film then I felt that the Nazi guards of the prison camp were not evil enough. I get that history dictates the airmen between opposing forces had a certain respect for each other and therefore the prisoners of a Luftwaffe Oflag were treated quite handsomely. But this historical accuracy does the film no justice, as for the most part I felt the consequences of the prisoners getting caught actioning an escape plan would've generated way more tension if I was led to believe they would involve a firing squad. One guard in particular personified this softness amongst the Nazis - Werner ""The Ferret"", who could almost be described as comical. I guess overall it detracted from the accomplishment of the escape, and to be honest it's the only thing stopping me giving this film a flawless 10/10 rating. All things considered however, nothing stops The Great Escape from being an absolute timeless classic.",9.0,Anonymous,History

The Great Escape,"An Allied team of international design seeks to thwart their Axis captors in the most unusual prison break by undertaking a laborious tunneling effort. Based on real events as described by former POW turned author, Paul Brickhill (SL3 Poland), it's cast is a starry one (McQueen Garner Attenborough Coburn Bronson Pleasence Messemer) and will entertain those who watch for celebrity's sake, yet, this critic finds engineering dramas to be some of the most tedious, particularly when absent a valuable charm, unnecessary to the plot but makes you smile, pulling you on set in bond with the characters. To borrow the words of Justice Stewart (Jacobellis v. Ohio) (64): ""(you'll) know it when (you) see it.""

Ultimate McQueen Movie,"All his previous films seem to have been simply prelude, leading up to the movie that let Steve McQueen portray the ultimate non-conformist and give audiences Hollywood's greatest chase sequence up to that time (along with his later 1968 car chase in Bullitt, it still stands as a milestone).I was a McQueen fan since his early days in Wanted: Dead or Alive. His character was unique, both in persona; a bounty hunter was/still is viewed with some disdain, but he turned Josh Randall into a moralist; and the gimmick hog leg Winchester he carried. Another viewer has already noted the unique series opening sequence with its initial camera zoom to McQueen's hip and the sawed off rifle, to his stride down the store front which ended with him ripping a wanted poster off the marshall's office bulletin board.As a kid, I had an avid interest in motorcycles and especially in military aviation, while most of my friends were into hot rods. So 'The Great Escape' was my kind of movie. Having McQueen play Hilts was the ultimate icing to the cake.But in 1963 McQueen had not yet reached the mega-star status he achieved after 'Bullitt' and his films of the 1970s so I was one of few people who followed his career closely. I was surprised then, when I met a very cute but shy girl in school who followed McQueen's career like other girls followed Elvis and the Beatles. She even had an autographed photo of him! We used to go see his films together at drive-ins and actually watch the entire movie!!! The Great Escape---great memories.",,Anonymous,History

A Great Film!,"The Great Escape is one of the greatest WWII films. The acting, direction, and story are perfect. Each and every one of the main characters is fresh and likable. At times, ""Great Escape"" is even moving, especially, for me, when Charles Bronson's character fights his claustrophobia. The movie never gets boring or to slow, even though it is 172 minutes long. Of course, there are some downsides to the film. It isn't historically accurate, and the campy atmosphere throughout can be overdone at times. Overall, the good more than makes up for my tiny complaints.I give ""The Great Escape"" a high 8/10, its #98 on my top 100. One of my favorite popcorn movies, I never get tired of seeing it. The only reason it doesn't get a 9 or a 10, is that the movie is pure entertainment. It doesn't really have anything to say. Definitely deserving of its reputation as a war classic.

"I rate it up their among the other great war Movies, Fantastic!","""The Great Escape"" is a combination of great acting, actors, directing, Great Music, and of course the great action sequences.  The director John Sturges employed great film techniques.  The overall escape spanned over a year I think in real life.  However, since this is only a movie length movie, it has successfully captured that whole time without any noticeable gaps.  The movie is in color which was somewhat uncommon before 1963, so that is a bonus.The elaborate set of the P.O.W camp was exemplary.  The director did not hesitate to confine the camera views, he tried to capture as much as possible of the camp at times, taking full advantage of the expansive set.The action sequences were well done.  The motorbike scenes well very good. Quick takes of different shots, used a lot of wide shots to capture the surroundings. The music was extremely entertaining.  The opening theme and internal music is one of the best I've ever heard.  Especially during the action sequences, changes to suit the different people escaping.One of the good things about this movie is because it doesn't have a happy ending.  Not all of the POW's escape, which coincides with reality as this is a true story with some Hollywood additions to spice the movie up.  The location of shooting in Europe was very good and added to the aesthetics of the film.The on-going Cooler King, Steve McQueen added the most humor into the film, making it not so serious.  Speaking of McQueen I have to mention the stunts. Excellent motorbike stunts. Another bit of humor was the try-hard Australian and some classic lines in the film.If there is anything to criticize in the actual shooting of the film is that there were some noticable continuity errors from different shots.  For the actual movie, It is much better to see it on DVD as it is very much considerably cleaned up as far as picture and sound quality are concerned.I can't find anything in the actual plot or story to criticize, but there must be something.I rate it 9.5/10  Just Absolutely Fantastic.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Insanely entertaining Hollywood storytelling.,"The Great Escape is tonally like a proto-'Ocean's-Eleven'; a mixture of comedy, drama, and suspense featuring a group of uniquely compelling characters pulling off a secret job.

The cast delivers fun performances, particularly McQueen, Attenborough, and Pleasance, though in very different ways. Totally worth the near 3 hours.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Who's minding the fort?!,"I was careful to read as many reviews here before posting my own opinions,having just watched this film for the first time this weekend.Let's get something straight: I know my history and I know fully well that German treatment of POWs was not to the shocking level of genocide that wascommonly associated with treatment in the concentration camps. So shut upabout how much you think you know (or don't know) about the historicalaccuracies of this film. We're talking about a movie, and thus it's purpose is primarily to entertain. So historical accuracy aside, does the truth necessarily make for a better film?Where was the sense of threat in this movie? Prisoners are allowed to moveabout anywhere they want, throw parties, wear what they want, whip upmoonshine, etc. It's no wonder they had no problem constructing secret tunnels. Nobody was keeping an eye on them to begin with. How hard is it to outsmartthe enemy when they're portrayed as a bunch of knuckleheads anyway? TheGermans are so lax at this camp that  the prisoners are seemingly in control of their own surroundings and one wonders why they felt the need to escape at all. McQueen tries to escape and gets caught a number of times, ending up insolitary confinement. He even strikes a few officers from time to time. Others pay for their disrespect and attempts at escape with death, but not good ole' Steve.

Great enough for its time attracting some misplaced criticism,"This film is of its era and given the Hollywood makeover to be expected of the time and, by today's standards, is a little weak on gritty realism. Yet is has far more accuracy to the real story than is given credit and remains an entertaining romp with a great cast, many displaying very subtle realistic traits of behaviour. Most of the characters are true to real people or are composite representations of such people. Many of the negative comments here pick on rather trite issues and often present so called factual errors that are wrong themselves such as: 1 The prisoners wearing uniforms rather than overalls - they did wear uniforms. 2. The apparent relaxed atmosphere of the ""Nazi"" camp - not all camps were Auschwitz for goodness sake and the Luftwaffe camps were noted for having remarkably better conditions and allowed plenty of leisure activities and scope for the cleanliness observed (food supplies as in many camps was sporadic but not severe until close to the war's end) 3. The fact that Coburn, Bronson and Garner were included for a American audience (alongside McQueen) playing commonwealth servicemen - only Garner portrayed a ""commonwealth"" serviceman, and did it rather well, as the Aussie. Garner was a US member of the RAF's Eagle Squadron and Bronson was from Poland Furthermore while no Americans escaped many did in fact work on the tunnels, Bronson's character was principally based on a Canadian who was transferred prior to the escape but artistic licence is OK.",8.0,Anonymous,History

One of the most notable classic films about World War II.,"This film was made as a kind of homage to the fifty Allied war prisoners who were killed in the course of a spectacular escape from a Luftwaffe prison camp. This is a historical and well-known fact, and we can even visit the camp, which has been preserved. But don't expect this film to be a faithful reconstruction of the facts, because it is not. The film abuses of creative liberty and much of what we see in the film was invented or restructured. There are characters that mix the characteristics of more than one real individual, there are things that never happened (the plane flight, for example) and the participation of American POW's in the escape attempt was not so noteworthy. But Hollywood has already used us for films that disregard history accuracy.The cast is luxurious and has a lot of eminent actors. I particularly liked the good work shown by Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson and Richard Attenborough, who give life to three of the main conspirators in the escape. McQueen gives life to a fugitive veteran, tireless in his attempts but who always ends up in the ""cooler"", planning the next one; Bronson also became very sympathetic thanks to his fear of tight spaces. In addition to them, the film features the excellent work of James Garner, Donald Pleasence, Nigel Stock, Angus Lennie, James Coburn and Hannes Messemer, the latter of them in the role of the German camp commander. In general, everyone had time to show value, and they did it, making good use of the material they received, in particular the excellent dialogues.The film is almost three hours long, but it is worth every minute and never makes us feel that we waste time in unnecessary details. Well filmed, he has a good cinematography and has worked hard to build realistic and credible sets and costumes. It is not the kind of war movie loaded with shootings and action scenes, even though it has several tense scenes and some exciting pursuits. We could really feel how tight that tunnel was, and how much each of those men has risked to, at least, cause the biggest possible disturbance behind the enemy's lines. Another essential detail of this film is its iconic soundtrack, signed by Elmer Bernstein. The sum of all this results in one of the most notable classical war films, which even inspired other cinema works, such as ""Chicken Run"", a stop-motion animated film where we can see the structure of the prison camp in that great chicken coop, and also listen to this film's theme song as those chickens desperately try to get away.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Really, this is just a great caper flick","It's interesting to read all of the rave reviews this movie gets. ""Best war movie ever"" and so forth. I admit its good, and an excellent example of the Hollywood movie making machine in full epic mode, but it's hardly the best war movie ever made. In fact, its not really a war movie at all. Its a jail breakout movie. It is more similar to movies like ""escape from Alcatraz"", ""the hot rock"" and ""heat"" and ""the Italian job"" than it is to Saving Private Ryan or full metal jacket.It's also interesting how the focus of the hype for the movie focuses on Steve McQueen, when in fact, if anyone owns this movie, its James Garner. He displays the best range, is on the screen longer than anyone else and his role displays all of the ambiguities that were involved in the POW situation. Plus, cool for cool, he gives Steve a run for his money. McQueen on the other hand spends most of his time throwing a baseball and giving his trademark ambiguous smile and waiting to ride his motorcycle.The rest of cast is a perfect bit of type casting, starting with Bronson, through Coburn and the rest. A pity Mr. Coburn wasn't given more to work with, but then, I've always liked him. Donald Pleasance makes the movie real.As for Richard Attenborough, am I the only one cheering for the Germans against him by the end of the film? Maybe its just because he inflicted the world with the movie ""Gandhi"" but I find the man to be a supercilious twit. But again, that's kind of what his role called for.As for the rest of the film, all very competently done, sets are good (although interiors look a little like cardboard at times) and someone could have dressed the Germans better. They all look like they bought off the rack uniforms without getting them altered. The theme music was as unmistakable as the pink panther or a spaghetti western, you can whistle it after the movie ends.Lastly, and this was sort of inadvertent, watching this movie with so many great stars in their youthful prime, one is left with a sense of wistfulness now that most are dead and the remainder are a bunch of old men.

"Very entertaining war movie, but looks dated","Just saw this for the first time last night after hearing so many good things about it over the years. My initial impression was that this is so far from what you think of when you think German POW camp that it bordered on the absurd. But then I heard that indeed the Luftwaffe ran the camp and their camps were much more humane than the Concentration Camps that have received much more attention.The suspense of the movie is great and I loved the fact that it did not have a ""Hollywood ending"". Nevertheless, several details point to the obvious fact that this movie was a Hollywood product and that it was from a period before realism and authenticity became necessary to win over audiences. In summary, my objections are:1. The POW's looked very well fed, clean-shaved and illness free throughout. I can understand that this was not Auschwitz, but come on!2. A remarkable number of German officers spoke excellent English. Perhaps this was needed to keep the story moving along, but it was completely ridiculous.3. Similarly, many of the prisoners, once they are on the run, show a command of German that seems hard to believe. As anyone knows, most people can spot a foreigner the second they open their mouth to speak because of their accent. Yet Bartlett passes for German with no difficulty at all.These may seem like minor quibbles, but they are indicative of an age when audiences were perhaps less cynical and Hollywood could get away with a lot more.All in all, a great movie, but a dated one.",8.0,Anonymous,History

The motorcycle chase scene with Steve McQueen,"The German Army motorcycles used during WWII were BMWs. In the now classic chase scene where Steve McQueen is pursued by many German soldiers, the motorbike ridden by the actor was in actuality a 1950's Triumph! It was really a British twin motorcycle disguised to look like a vintage 1940's German Army BMW motorbike! The vehicles used by the Germans were real vintage 1940's cars, trucks & motorcycles which were repaired to working order to add realism to the script. You can find this information among the many extras in the latest DVD version of The Great Escape re-released in 2004 as a special collector's edition of the movie. You can find it at Best Buy.

It gets better each time you watch it !,"This film simply gets better each time you watch it ! Everybody can relate to a character in this masterpiece - whether it be the scrounger, forger, 'cooler-king', intelligence etc. The documentary that comes with the DVD enhances the film immensely - showing around the original camp showed how realistic the film actually was.

Takes Stalag 17 and Improves Upon It,"In the tradition of Billy Wilder's ""Stalag 17"", we have a group of soldiers (some seemingly American, some British) trapped in a German POW camp. Steve McQueen, who plays the Cooler King, has tried to escape many times before... but now there's a whole campwide effort to dig tunnels under the camp. Can it work?James Garner, who plays the Scrounger, really steals the show. McQueen is top billed, and plays the handsome lead, but he really just works on the outskirts of the plot for most of the film. Garner is right in the center, fulfilling the role William Holden had in ""Stalag"" and Morgan Freeman would have in ""Shawshank Redemption"".I also have to give a shout-out to a fairly young Donald Pleasence, who plays Flight Lt. Colin Blythe ""The Forger"". Okay, maybe not that young, but for those of us who know him from the horror films of the 1980s... (And best of all, Pleasance was an actual POW in a German camp during WWII.)""Great Escape"" is humorous, it has characters we actually give a hoot about, and it had a major influence on a lot of later great films: ""The Goonies"" and ""Shawshank Redemption"", for example. I wish I could say more about how great this film is... it's really worth a viewing or two.",8.0,Anonymous,History
How many times can one see it?,"The Great Escape is a great film. The main problem with it is that in the UK it has been shown on TV probably twice a year at least since it's first TV showing - in fact it seems like more. When it is on I, for one, usually try to avoid it but if I do catch 5 minutes then I am hooked all over again! The cast is wonderful, a mixture of real stars and character actors. Although it is a long film the pacing is superb and the viewer's attention is held throughout. My favourite characters are played by James Garner, Charles Bronson, James Coburn,Richard Attenborough and James Donald. Steve McQueen plays Hiltz the cooler king in his usual laconic, comic style but I find it annoying considering American POWs did not make such a huge contribution to escapes like these. It was great to see so many actors from The Magnificent Seven (another awesome favourite of mine) back on screen and directed again by John Sturges - he knew what he was doing in casting.",8.0,Anonymous,History

That helped the overall experience of this masterpiece film.THE music score is superb.  The characters so vividly portrayed. The suspense and action so incredible.  This movie brings Paul Brickhill's book to life.  It doesn't seem like a three hour movie.  It leaves one wanting to know more....what happens next...?There are darn few GREAT movies of which I believe in owning a 'store bought' copy.  This is one I am proud to own.

The best surprise ever,"My Dad rented this movie for us a few years ago, when I was twelve or thirteen. I admit, at first I was doubtful: it was a nearly-three-hour war movie, and I was supposed to enjoy it? Yes, I was, and I more than did. There are a few movies I've watched that I didn't expect much out of but that I ended up loving, but this one surpasses them all. Most three-hour movies, even my absolute favorite ones, move rather slow. This movie, however, is surprisingly quick-paced. Only movies like ""Sound of Music"" and A&E's ""Pride and Prejudice"", and now this one, have managed to be so long, yet so quick paced.The acting is very good, and each and every character is engaging. This is possibly one of the few feel-good war movies out there, and is possibly also the most upbeat and fun to watch.

It's Great Escapist!,"I guess we can all call Hollywood to task for its war movies. Until recently, they were pretty sanitized. Did you ever see a John Wayne movie where his buddies were beheaded or dismembered. People die in a nice peaceful way, usually throwing their arms in the air, slinging their guns behind them. We don't even see the wound. When ""The Great Escape"" came out, this was pretty much the case. The other prisoner of war movie to gain popularity with the general population was ""Stalag 17"" with Robert Ryan as the bad guy. Does it matter. If we are going to stretch reality anyway, can we make our Germans the way we want them. We can make our allied prisoners experts in various types of demolition and subterfuge. With that understood, we now create a magical effort to fool those bad guys and make a grand escape from the prison camp. The writers did a nice job, building suspense and anticipation. Enough roadblocks are thrown up to make it fun. And, of course, this is a real prison camp with real guards and real bullets. No one should look at the ripoff mentality of ""Hogan's Heroes"" and think that there is a comparison. As one writer said, the Germans would not have been too happy with what was going on and wouldn't have been so careless and so dumb. Nevertheless, like any adventure movie worth its salt, this is great fun.",8.0,Anonymous,History
As great as the title promises,"This film is a great account of a historical prison escape during World War II, filled with a variety of memorable characters and plots. It is heavier on the escapist entertainment than the heavy drama found in more violent works like Schindler's List. While there is some suspense and violence, it is never very brutal and is aimed for a general audience. The conditions in the camp itself are surprisingly lenient, with the prisoners allowed things like sharp metal tools and chocolate; even more surprising is that this part is historically accurate as well. Within these confines, we follow the exploits of some brave and plucky men as they try their luck at various plans and plots. ""Luck"" is the key word here as this is not embellished heroism; there are plenty of failures and setbacks. Even once they escape, there are daring escapades trying to get across Germany and into Switzerland where they will find freedom, and most of them do not survive. This sense of unpredictability keeps the audience on their toes as we want to see these relatable figures make it all the way.",8.0,Anonymous,History
da da da da da da da da da da da (sing it with me),"So I watched 1963's ""The Great Escape"", starring dead people who include Steve Mcqueen. So is this movie a classic, well I say yes. If you watch this movie you may find yourself saying ohh.. that's where that came from (in reference to any number of movies and TV shows that have paid homage to this movie including say the Simpsons). The whistled theme is just awesome something I have whistled since I was a kid. The movie is true to the original true story. It is very well acted. Exciting from beginning to end, and does not have a happy ending (which isn't necessarily a bad thing). Well why not because sometimes it is more about the journey in life than the destination, and the creative forces and sheer will of these men to escape from their German captors makes for great movie watching.

They Do Not Make Them Like This Anymore,"The Great EscapeAnother ensemble movie for Brosnan and another absolute classic. And again I'm going to say the same thing. They don't make them like this anymore.This was a movie I used to watch every year, when it was on tv in the UK, usually over Easter. A funny thing happened when I watched it today, it went dark outside during the time I watched it, just like it did the first time I watched it, when I was a child.This is full of stars, Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, James Coburn, Donald Pleasence and of course Brosnan.Brosnan is billed behind McQueen, Garner, Richard Attenborough and James Donald, and has a good supporting role with plenty of screen time.I won't get into spoilers, as I'm sure most here have not seen it, but it certainly doesn't have a happy ending, and I'm always upset by what happens to certain characters.The first half of the movie is quite lighthearted in places as they fool they outwit the guards, but the last hour is just full of tension.All the cast are solid, McQueen is charismatic as hell, Bronson is as strong as he always is, whilst James Gardner is someone I'd gladly follow and fight to the death, beside. I need to mention how great Donald Pleasence is too!!Amusing story; during production, Charles Bronson met and fell in love with David McCallum's wife, Jill Ireland, and he (I'm sure jokingly) told McCallum he was going to steal her away from him. In 1967, Ireland and McCallum divorced, and she married Bronson.There was a sequel made to this that starred Christopher Reeve and Judd Hursh, that usually aired over two nights in the UK during the early 90's, that is also worth checking out.",9.0,Anonymous,History

perfect,"Very rarely do casting, script, soundtrack, editing, performance, cinematography and direction gel so sublimely. Re-visiting this for the sake of childhood nostalgia - Hilts motorbike slide into barbed wire and Christmas post-turkey trifle are forever entwined in my brain - I was struck afresh by the perfection of this film. The mix of derring-do and comedy takes on a shadow with Bartlett's arrival, and then goes a shade deeper with the death of Ives. By the time the men are machine-gunned down in an open field, the tonal shift has moved deftly to the other end of the spectrum. The making of moonshine, and the reaction of the brewers - three simple 'wows' - is a masterclass in economy in scripting. Ditto the rhythmic use of the baseball smacking against the wall in the cooler. And the score - once heard, never forgotten. Quite simply, this is arguably the greatest film ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"The best concentration camp parody ever with ""Stalag 17"".","In 1953, the Academy award winner for best actor was William Holden in ""Stalag 17"" which was the story of a German concentration camp for Americans and was made to look ridiculous.  In 1963, the best actor Oscar went to Sidney Poitiers for ""Lilies of the field"" and this is totally all right by me.  However, I came to notice that ""The great escape"" didn't get any nominations either for acting, directing, or even best picture.  And this movie is ranked #81 on our IMDb voting list whereas the 1963 winner for best picture, ""Tom Jones"", isn't even there.  Maybe ""Tom Jones"" deserved the best picture that year, but ""The great escape"" should definitely have had at least a nomination.Captain Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen) winds up in a German prison camp where he doesn't know anyone.  But there isn't only him in that camp.  A few days after he arrives at the camp, a well-known English Captain, Bartlett (Richarrd Attenborough), arrives as well and decides to take matters into his own hands by preparing escape plans for at least 250 of the prisoners in the camp.  Naturally, a job like this one requires a lot of help.  So he gets Hendley ""The Scrounger"" (James Garner), Danny Velinski ""Tunnel King"" (Charles Bronson), Colin Blythe ""The Forger"" (Donald Pleasance), and Sedgwick ""Manufacturer"" (James Coburn) to team up with him to make this one the biggest escape from a concentration camp ever.  This one has to be THE great escape.At first, Hilts declines Bartlett's proposition to join his group claiming that he is going to escape much earlier than the rest of the group.  But after he screws up and is sent to ""The cooler"", he decides to join up with Bartlett as soon as he is released from ""The cooler"" and when he does, the Germans begin wishing these men never entered this concentration camp in their whole life.  But even though these men are pros at this kind of work, the Germans are able to find out about a few of their plans but to keep myself from spoiling anything, I won't tell you anymore about the movie itself.Director John Sturges has indeed directed some very god movies including the great ""The magnificent seven"", but he truly outdid himself in ""The great escape"".  The movie offers suspense, action, and some good laughs as well and keeps you wondering what will happen to the main characters until you do see what does happen.  Steve McQueen gives one of his best performances and Attenborough is excellent as well.  Some of the best scenes of the movie are when you see the Americans preparing their escape and all the work and trouble they have to go through to get it done.  It's definitely the greatest escape I've ever seen.",,Anonymous,History

One of the greats of its genre,"World War Two rages on and in the occupied Poland a new prison camp has been built. A camp unlike anything that has been seen before. A camp to house all the worst jailbreakers the war has seen. But when such a group of clever and resourceful men are put together, what else can they do but attempt to escape.The film is based on true events, a true camp, and while there are some historical mishaps - not to mention outright tampering - it's still for the most part a rather accurate portrayal. The biggest change to the narrative is the addition of a couple of American prisoners, while in real life almost all of the prisoners were citizens of the Commonwealth. Quite honestly I didn't let it bother me.There's a lot of characters, but the film is of such quality that you learn all of their names and characters almost instantly. Perhaps the first few minutes you'll be a bit lost and then it's like you've known these men all your life. It helps that they all have their assigned, individual roles to help in the escape. There are forgers, scavengers, lookouts, misleaders, diggers and of course Richard Attenborough's Roger Bartlett as the Big X, the leader of the whole thing.The film has a lot of charm and is an excellent example of its genre. Especially because for once the film doesn't have to explain why we should root for the jailbreaker. Prisoners in a Nazi prison are automatically sympathetic.If I have a problem with the film, it would have to be with the final act. Without giving away too much, the film is based on true events and it sticks to those events. I can't blame it for that and it would have been an insult to change the events, but a part of me still wishes that the happy-go-lucky charm of the first acts could have been preserved.Oh well, such is life.

One of the greatest escapes...,"""The Great Escape"" is an adventure movie which is based on true historical events during World War II and especially we watch a group of allied escape artist type prisoners of war (POW's) put in an 'escape proof' camp. There they will try to escape with all of their powers.I really liked this movie because it's a movie which is based on true historical events and of course the plot of this movie was excellent. If we think that this movie is based on the truth or most of it then we can understand how difficult was for those people to be prisoners and we can watch how hard the wanted to be free. We also watch them put all their effort to reach freedom with any cause. Steve McQueen was simply outstanding in this movie and I really liked his interpretation, also James Garner's interpretation who played as Hendley was equally good such Charles Bronson who played as Danny. I also have to say about the escape plan that was magnificent and really brilliant, and I believe with this the direction wanted to show us that these people had spend plenty of their living time on prison and they wanted to change it and be free again.Finally I have to say that ""The Great Escape"" is one of the best adventure movies with this plot (escape from a prison) and I believe that if you are a fan of adventurous movies then I am sure that you will love it.

From the start of the film, the audience is drawn in with the catchy theme song as we build an opening and develop our characters.

Solid entertainment,"Prisoner of war movies are mostly sombre, serious affairs, as the stakes involved are literally life and death. The Great Escape proves that they can also be absorbing, engrossing, and dare I say, wildly entertaining. The Great Escape succeeds at least partly because of the breadth it offers. The entire escape process, from planning to execution is shown, and so is the full escape- Just escaping the POW camp hardly counts as a true escape, the full escape involves getting to neutral Switzerland also. The film is hence quite extraordinary in devoting one full hour to track the prisoners after their escape from the camp and their outcomes. This helps offer lush, beautiful photography of the Alps, the quaint German towns, and of course, Steve McQueen riding a motorcycle. This also gives an extra serving of suspense, delivered on top of already tense and riveting sequences earlier in the POW camp. Despite this, I have to say the film is still too long- a good half hour could have been trimmed from the escape planning scenes, as the film lags and gets a tad monotonous near the middle. Overall, I think the film could have leant more into the adventure aspect it portrays in cutting some run time from the comparably dull planning sequences, though even without these cuts, the film still manages to be a wildly engrossing, entertaining work.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Must see,"I am glad the previous reviewer wrote about the history of stalags and escapes to help straighten out some of the people that did not believe this really happened or some of it, it's like the Battle of the Bulge movie, it was based on history but it has many flaws, like the tanks in it, by the end of the war, there were not enough German Tanks left in running condition to make a movie, so they use what they have, but that does not mean the movie and what is in it, did not happen.I love the array of stars in this, it's just one of those films where everything seems to fit perfectly, the acting is top notch, the scenery is fantastic, and the things they added to the true story helped form it into an great picture.The musical score is an all time classic, and so is the film.You can't miss on this one, I showed it to my boys when they were young and we all watched it again in their teens and they have seen it themselves since, and it's a movie they have never forgotten and that I have heard them talk about when great movies are mentioned.Knowing it really happened just makes it that much better and that much more fun to watch, it has several sad parts to it, but that's history and they could not change that.All I can say is don't miss this one if you have not seen it, watch it at least once in your life, I could watch it anytime it's on TV or I occasionally put it in my DVD player an watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,History

At first the music didn't seem to fit, but after while you realize the genius behind that classic tune. The actors are all perfect in their roles, and I particularly enjoyed Steve McQueen in the lead. It was my first taste of the Oscar nominated actor, and he couldn't have made a better impression.I really liked the links I saw to Shawkshank Redemption, which obviously was influenced by this classic WWII escape movie. From the moles they had, to the removing dirt/stone by shaking it out of their pants, you can easily tell the influence it has had. I also liked that while Steve McQueen is considered the lead by default, there really wasn't an actual screen time lead. There were roughly 8 actors who shared most of the screen time, and it was directed perfectly.But I would say the lack of a defining villain was the reason it wasn't a perfect film. For a movie that nears 3 hours, I would have liked to get to know the main bad guys of the camp more, which would have made the final escape even more thrilling. I didn't know the actual outcome, so it did surprise me who made it out and who didn't.

Wonderful John Sturges directed,"Seventy six escaped, but fifty were shot. Scrounger, James Garner, was returned and so was Steve McQueen. James Coburn escaped. It depicts a March 24, 1944 historical escape from a Nazis prison camp. Steve McQueen was 14 years old on that date. Steve McQueen became an icon with his motorcycle riding in this film. His bike was a Triumph made to look like a BMW. Mark Wahlberg is similar to Steve McQueen. They are both gutsy even though rather short. McQueen's role is small in this film, and he walked to get it enlarged. I would have done that and shortened the film to two hours. It was done in 1963 with an enormous cast. Richard Attenborough was also in the film. Charles Bronson looks so young.Harrison Ford was not in the film, he has said. The capturing of the escapees is awful but true.

The movie took some major liberties with the true facts.The German commandant was a real marshmallow in this movie. I didn't get that part. Has there ever been anyone in a movie as naive as the nice-guy German guard that 'lost' his wallet to James Garner?""Yo aaams ....up!""The theme song is truly bad and they play it over and over for three hours.

The Great Escape Entertains,"I saw The Great Escape as a kid and absolutely loved it. I revisited it again recently (40 years later) and while I still enjoyed it, it was a considerably different experience. Even as a youngster I could see that they didn't really show much of the grisly, cruel, inhumane aspects of the war. As an adult I see that they didn't really show any of those aspects of the war and made the POW camp seem . . . Not so bad. In addition to having plenty of humor, it does also have moments of sadness and suspense and scenes of death, but on the whole handles those elements with a light touch and never lingers on those darker scenes. That's OK though because The Great Escape still works as a fun and highly entertaining WWII film which I still enjoyed and still recommend checking out.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"A Masterclass Of A War Movie: Probably A ""Boys Own"" Tale","Men like this film - I know - A (male) friend mentioned it to me and I found myself immediately singing ""that theme tune"" ... You know the one.Heck.. I'm a huge fan of Bronson and Richard Attenborough - Here, I think both men turn in some of their best performances. They don't have to work too hard - The script is well-paced, believable and engaging. A strong supporting cast does no harm either... It amounts to a roll-call of some of our finest European and American actors.If there are weaknesses in this movie, I'm hard-pressed to find any. You'll be glued to the screen as we're drawn into the strangely claustrophobic world of capable soldiers dealing with enforced incarceration.Each man is assigned a function and that function gives him something to live for. It's a deeply psychological piece, often moving and portrays the courageous spirit of men determined not to endure the fascist ""jack boot"".These Nazi camps really did exist and (at their worst) became the monstrosities of Auschwitz, Birkenau and the like. This film only hints at that... Since many escapees are (finally) executed in cold blood.But overall, I think, Great Escape is not about the Holocaust. It's about men who found ways to survive it. I think that's important and its a powerful message underpinning a fabulous film.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Archetypal Prisoner-of-War Drama,"Over the last half-century THE GREAT ESCAPE has established itself as THE prisoner-of-war drama for future directors interested in the genre to emulate. There are other films which can compete for this title (Billy Wilder's STALAG 17 (1953)) is a good candidate), but John Sturges' film simply gets everything right, from the ensemble cast to the locations and Elmer Bernstein's iconic theme tune. There is no need to rehearse the plot; rather we should pay attention to the way Sturges creates character cameos to show how the escape was essentially a team effort in which everyone - regardless of rank or nation - played their part. Donald Pleasance's Blythe (""The Forger"") proves exceptionally adept at his task, even though his myopia hinders the escape when it actually takes place. Charles Bronson's Danny (""The Tunnel King"") becomes almost paralyzed with fear when the time comes to escape; it is as if he cannot contemplate the prospect of life outside. Even James Donald, as the SBO (Senior British Officer) has his part to play - although not actively involved in the escape - he knows how to manage his German captors. The set-designs (Kurt Ripberger) and photography (Daniel L. Fapp) are wondrous; we get sense of the claustrophobia of the prison-camp, which is only exacerbated in the tunnels; this is contrasted with the wide expanses of the Alps as the fugitives make their futile bids to reach the Swiss border. While there might be some slightly jarring elements (James Coburn's Australian accent is rather eccentric, to be polite), THE GREAT ESCAPE is nothing less than a timeless classic.",8.0,Anonymous,History

True...this happened.,"My father was imprisoned there as a Prisoner of War. It was one of several Prisoner of War camps he was placed in. He served in the Canadian Army. He survived the Great Death March ordered by Hitler. I'm sure their confinement was much more difficult than this movie conveys. Just the same I'm grateful that this movie was made and has kept alive the amazing efforts of those who when they enlisted signed an agreement that they would do all they could to attempt an escape if captured. They have found several of the original tunnels and they invited all the still living original diggers/ escapees to return to view the findings and to fill in the gaps as to what the archeaologists had retrieved from the exposed tunnels.

Pranks,"The Great Escape is one of those movies that personifies the dream of prisoners.  Speaking as someone who spent a good deal of time in detention in high school, it is no wonder when I saw this as a junior that I latched onto it so quickly.The storytelling technique in itself is a flop because too many characters are represented, thus we aren't able to identify with them.  John Sturges is a competent director, but some ""serious"" moments borderline comedy.  Most of the actors were just too inexpressive (Bronson in particular) that they just became a large, faceless mass of accents.  The Germans are presented in a fashion of stupidity, typical for a movie like this, and the guards' uniforms are an absolute riot to look at, tying with the stormtroopers in Star Wars for ridiculousness.You can argue about the morals and values of the POWs all you want, but when you boil it down, the Great Escape is all one giant prank pulled off by dozens of men to the dismay of their captors.  It's that simple.  Steve McQueen (in the days before Eastwood gave rise to the squinting anti-hero) epitomizes the attitude with his frequent shenanigans.It's interesting how many elements from this movie have been repeated by Steven Spielberg.  Whether it's the initial unveiling of the fence (reminiscent of Jurassic Park) to the anti-climatic motorcycle chase (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade).  Elmer Bernstein's music is a swing of 60s tension and liveliness, similar to much of his work in Ghostbusters.  He isn't Bernard Hermann, but I'm not complaining.Overall, The Great Escape is a movie that should only be seen from beginning to end.  There isn't any suspense, most of it is predictable, and you may feel more than a little cheated at times.  Nonetheless, between this and Cool Hand Luke, you should understand the whole 60s anti-hero genre very quickly.  End of discussion.  3.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,History
"Good, Not so Bad, and just a tad Ugly","First off, has John Sturges ever directed a true ""stinker?"" This may not be among his very best but at times it shines although as many have already commented, despite not portraying anything much like the real event. This flick benefits from good writing and quality performances from all: The 1st-team (Garner, McQueen, Attenborogh), 2nd team (Bronson, Pleasence, Coburn, etc.) and an array of 3-stringers. The score - and especially the main theme, are superb; production values are high, and action vs dialogue, side plots, etc. are all well balanced and/or above par. For 1963 this is more like a big-budget adventure pix of the 40s: It depends upon story and not pyrotechnics. Well worth a view for the uninitiated, for most it is probably a worthwhile DVD investment especially now given its budget-price.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Out you escapees go, through the door or out the window...","""The Great Escape"" works for two reasons; these are two elements that have been argued time and time again, only to come up for air once in a blue moon. This film works, and nearly demands repeat viewings, because director John Sturges has complete and utter confidence in his actors, and secondly, it works because the script is kept so simple that the final act seems to come from nowhere. It is the classic bait-and-switch routine pulled off with such grace and delicacy, that I nearly missed it myself. Sturges makes this feature work because of his cast, his star-studded cast that is bigger than belief, yet so grounded, one would think that this was everyone's first feature. Amazingly, in one film, one can witness the emotion of Charles Bronson, the loyalty of James Garner, the leadership of Richard Attenborough, the fear of Donald Pleasence, the cunning of James Coburn, and finally the patriotism of Steve McQueen. Let me say this again, in ONE film, you can see all of this  and so much more. Not only do you see these great qualities come out with full force, but each actor works with each other to build a comradery, to make this film work  there is no stress for screen time, they all are eager to make cinematic magic  and it shows. One could speak for hours about this cast; it is half of what makes this film work. It is the cast that keeps you glued to your screen. It is the cast that makes you want to view the next minute of the film. It is the cast that holds this film together  but there is another big part  the script.""The Great Escape"" works on the next level because Sturges realizes the simplicity of the script, and he does not let that, well, escape. This film easily could have been a convoluted story about escapees trying to elude Nazis, perhaps a love story mixed in, and that cliché element of a inside man. All of these elements could have been mixed in, but Sturges knew that he had strong enough actors that the audience would have no issues following them till the end. The story is kept simple, because it is the endurance of these men that was meant to shine, not the eruption of cliché events on screen. This 1962 film hit it square on the head, modern cinema cannot seem to grasp the idea that less will create more  and Sturges saw that with ""The Great Escape"". Even with a nearly three hour film, it kept my attention throughout because of these two very simple ideas. Strong cast  simple story.There is nothing negative about this film that I could see. The idea that the Nazis were just there as roadblocks for our escapees was intriguing because typically they are more involved. Thinking of the modern film ""Hart's War"", which Ferrell and Willis work together to escape a similar situation, we have so many stories of race, trust, and fear working against the story that it turns into a huge blockbuster of a film filled with cliché over cliché, merely to turn a profit. While there are big names broadcasting in this film, it doesn't work like ""The Great Escape"" because the tones are too dark, the themes seem misleading, and our actors fight, literally fight, for screen time that it all becomes muddled and incohesive. In Sturges film, the light shone during the day, our actors never were hurt, and being thrown in solitary seemed like a fly in the pan. Sturges sense of brevity should not be dismissed, while there was a lacking sense of realism throughout this film, it was forgettable. This is rare for me while watching films, because as this was a non-fiction story, there is a level of realism needed to fully submerge into the film  but Sturges does something spectacular  he gives us such great characters, deeply involved within this simple story, that the apathetic Nazis seemed genuine. ""The Great Escape"" is a flawless film. There are others that could dissect this film bit by bit, but for me, it was nearly three hours of pure entertainment.Overall, I was quite impressed with this big-budget film with big-named stars and the biggest escape known to man. As we move into the summer of blockbuster films, where stars all vie for the top weekend spot, hurdling over others and expectations falling short, this old 1960s film (if re-released today) could rival those like ""Hancock"", ""Indiana Jones"" and even ""Dark Knight"". ""The Great Escape"" proved that if you have a strong cast, develop a simple story  allowing your characters to create their own moments, and just have fun with the material handed to, than you will have on your hands an instant classic. Modern films over the years continue to borrow or re-imagine scenes from this film, and that is the highest form of flattery, but it is also a sign that Hollywood has found moments that work, and will do anything in their power to recreate. Aside from the Hollywood recycling bin argument, ""The Great Escape"" has an amazing ensemble cast which could rival that of ""Oceans 11"", and the nearly three hours breeze by with the greatest of ease. Again, it is a flawless film. It was a surprise for this first time viewer, and I cannot wait to introduce this feature to others who may have allowed it to fall through the cracks. Sturges has created Hollywood perfection. Watch this movie.Grade: ***** out of *****",10.0,Anonymous,History

It was so heartbreaking, especially knowing it was true.Even though the film does not give any backstory to the characters since they are way too many, you care and root for all of them. Although only 3 men escape successfully, I was particularly heartbroken about the fate of the blind man. You truly feel for that character.But it was extremely satisfying to watch the successful escape of the 3 men, specially the man who got to Spain, very short but extremely powerful scene. It makes you feel like the lives of the others were avenged in a way.Many people criticize the comedic tone of the film, I thought it was wonderful.

One of the All-Time Greats,"Great Escape, The (1963)**** (out of 4)One of the greatest films ever made deals with some POWs as they attempt to dig a tunnel underground and escape from a German camp. With the all-star cast, the terrific story and some masterful direction there's no question that this here deserves its high reputation and there's also no doubt that it's one of the greatest adventure films ever made. I think a lot of the credit must go to director John Sturges and I say this because even though the movie runs 170-minutes it actually feels like just a few minutes. It's rather amazing to see how short this movie actually feel and one of the things that I loved the most is how Sturges manages to keep the film moving at such a fast pace that you can't help but forget you're watching a movie. It almost feels as if you're actually there among these men and the way Sturges tells the story is much like a composer would come up with a score. There's just a certainly poetic flow to the movie that it really feels unlike anything else that I can think of. Of course, it doesn't hurt when you have a cast that includes excellent work from Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasence and James Coburn just to name a few. This is one of those films where every actor perfectly fits their part and this goes from the top to those with just a few lines in the picture. Another major plus is the way the director manages to build the suspense once the escape and the aftermath happens. Most people forget but after the escape we still have an hour worth of film left and many times directors would let the suspense fall after the big event but that doesn't happen here. The music score by Elmer Bernstein is among one of the greatest and most recognizable that you're ever going to hear and the cinematography from Daniel L. Fapp is equally impressive. THE GREAT ESCAPE is the type of movie that I'd say is timeless because it's subject matter is just something that's never going to die or get old.",,Anonymous,History
"Great entertainment, but elements not realistic","This is a great movie for entertainment, with lots of great actors, and some excellent scenes, my favorite being the motorcycle scenes starring Steve McQueen. One of my biggest peeves about this movie is the unrealistic way that the German officers and German soldiers act around the prisoners of war. Generally, the Germans allow the prisoners of war far more freedom and far more respect than is realistic. In addition, in many scenes in which an escaped prisoner is being apprehended or is already under the custody of the German authorities, the German authorities are not aggressive in any way, do not point their guns at the prisoner under arrest or custody, do not put them in handcuffs, allow the prisoners close contact with officers, etc. This is not realistic.On the plus side, this is a very entertaining movie, but these elements of the movie are not realistic at all.",8.0,Anonymous,History

A rousing WWII-era action drama,"John Sturges's ""The Great Escape"" is one of the classic films based around World War II. It is based on the true story of a group of Allied POWs and their attempt to escape a German POW camp designed to hold the most notorious escape artists.The story is an entertaining one and stays surprisingly close to the truth. The characters are composites, the timeline is compressed and there are a few concessions to American audiences but for the most part the story is untouched. The film's nearly three-hour running time doesn't drag at all, either.The cast is a strong one with many recognizable faces. Steve McQueen may be the star but there's strong support from Richard Attenborough, Donald Pleasance and several others. A couple of McQueen's ""Magnificent Seven"" cohorts join him as well, namely Charles Bronson & James Coburn.Sturges's direction is workmanlike but not particularly worth remarking on. Elmer Bernstein's score, on the other hand, contains one of the most iconic movie themes of all time. Overall, the production shows considerable polish and attention to detail.In the end, the film is an eminently satisfying old-fashioned blockbuster.

The Great Escape,"Got to be the definition of an all star (albeit all male) cast in this gripping demonstration of just how inventive and ingenious people can be when incarcerated and facing a bleak (if any) future.

Richard Attenborough stars as the proverbial pain in the ass to his Nazi guards having repeatedly escaped before, and he puts together his ""X"" organisation to work every scheme imaginable to get people out of this supposedly escape proof ""Super-Stalag "". Steve McQueen forms an unlikely alliance with Angus ""the Mole"" Lennie; James ""the scrounge"" Garner with the expert, tea-drinking, forger Donald Pleasance whose eyesight is failing rapidly; Charles Bronson and James Coburn and a whole raft of seasoned British actors bring this whole enterprise to life in a gritty, sometimes amusing, but ultimately determined way. Hannes Messemer ""The Kommandant"" also deserves mention as he seems to still cling to some of the basic tenets of human decency as he tries to stop the Gestapo from implementing their more drastic solutions.

"Today, on the 4:30 movie...","Ever notice how these movies hold up except for the humor?

This and various plot holes aside, the film is good and hard to ""put down"". The scenery shots flying around Germany and Switzerland are wonderful. But its far from perfect, I just found the stupidity of the Nazis in their ability to guard the prison camp too Col Klinkish. Amazing how once the prisoners escape, the Nazis then become this efficient crack bloodhound machine able to track them down through 3 countries. Coburn's Australian accent was nowhere to be found.

A Cinema Classic,"Steve McQueen, a leather jacket, slick blonde hair and a baseball ball and glove... if you can't guess the film than I don't know what to tell you.The Great Escape - for its time - would've fascinated and amazed its 20th century audience. Just shy of 3 hours, the post war film takes place during the Second World War where a group of soldiers are imprisoned in a high-alert prison camp, known for its tight security.Steve McQueen is the star of the show and watching the film in the present day of today, it is difficult truly appreciate the art of the picture, one which would've been mind-blowing on its release in 1963. Though there is no hiding its class and polish of cinematography provided incredibly by John Sturges.The premise is genius and reasons why this film is regarded a classic, the simple plot of soldiers known for breaking out of prison being placed in an air tight security camp offers so much to the innocent viewer. The smooth customer that is McQueen's character 'Hilts' with his trademark throw-catch with his baseball set, he helps set the tone for the watch, his intentions, frustration and past-life memories are encapsulated with real prowess.Ultimately, the iconic blockbuster is a spectacle of its kind, kickstarting a new era for film following two World War's.

A classic but not the best war movie,"Ask anybody of a certain age in the UK to name a war film and it's likely that The Great Escape will be the first mentioned. It's an iconic film that gets an airing on terrestrial TV every Christmas and nearly every public holiday. So to criticise it in anyway would be like telling your kindly ageing grandmother that she smells and her cooking sucks. So I'm going to show The Great Escape the respect it deserves and not be too critical.The Great Escape is based on the true story of a group of Allied prisoners of war who managed to escape from an allegedly impenetrable Nazi prison camp during World War II. At the beginning of the film, the Nazis gather all their most devious and troublesome POWs and place them at a new prison camp, which was designed to be impervious to escapes. Immediately, the prisoners develop a scheme where they will leave the camp by building three separate escape tunnels. Richard Attenborough is the British soldier who masterminds the whole plan, and who commands his motley squad--featuring Charles Bronson as a Polish trench-digging expert, James Garner as an American with a talent for theft, Donald Pleasence as a masterful forger, and Steve McQueen as an American rebel--through the construction of the tunnels and, eventually, their escapeThis is the first of four Steve Mcqueen films that i tend to review in the near future and is probably his most famous role. To be fair , it's not his most challenging role as regards acting is concerned. As like some of his other films the action scenes are the most memorable ones. His escape attempt from the Germans on a motorbike is the part of the film everyone remembers fondly and quite rightly so. You can see he's having so much fun in the muddy fields with that bike.The Great Escape is nearly three hours long but at no time does it drag. i think that's because of the great cast. Everyone is at the top of their game ( except James Coburn and his peculiar Australian accent) and it was not too often that a film a had such a mix of top British and American actors in one film. Richard Attenborough and Gordon Jackson are the serious players in the escape attempt while Steve Mcqueen and Angus Lennie bring a lighter side to the proceedings.It also has a very memorable and catchy soundtrack that everyone immediately recognises. What is it with films in the sixties and fantastic original soundtracks and why don't movies have them anymore?Being totally honest Stalag Luft III is portrayed more like a holiday camp than a prisoner of war camp but i suppose back it was made in 1963 , a little to close to the end of the war for it to be too brutal.The Great Escape is certainly not the best war film ever made , far from it , but it a great film for all the family to sit down and watch on a rainy Sunday afternoon.8 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,History
Pure Film,"This movie is pure film! Film was supposed to be a way to escape your troubles, and it has evolved beyond it to a form of art.

Many current film-makers forget both art and escapism and rely on the lowest common denominator to fill their coffers (frankly, I find it remarkable some of the space monkeys can write 10 lines of a pointless review here on IMDb), but The Great Escape is brilliant. It is simple fun, with remarkably good directing and cinematography, especially considering it was filmed in LA.

"Historically important, well made and well acted, The Great Escape is simply a film that must be seen","I'd heard lots of great things about The Great Escape, but had never got round to watching it until very recently. Having watched it, all I can say is that I wished I'd watched it years ago.The Great Escape is the true story of a mixture of American and English soldiers who are being held in a prisoner of war camp in Germany during World War 2. This film chronicles their escape from this POW camp. I went into watching this film with no prior knowledge of how the escape was orchestrated and that was the thing that really impressed me; the sheer ingenuity of the escape and how methodical and carefully planned everything was. Each man brings their own strengths to the table such as James Garner's character Scrounger who is the guy who can get anything for you (similar to Morgan Freeman in The Shawshank Redemption) and Donald Pleasance's character Blythe who is a 'master forger'. Truth be told, I would have enjoyed The Great Escape even if it was fictional, but the fact that this is a true story is a real testament to those men that were involved.Acting wise I'd probably single Attenborough and Pleasance out as being the best, but that's not to disparage anyone else as everyone was excellent. This is another example of a film that has humour, tension and at times it was also quite moving. History had already written the script for this film so it's down to the actors to bring the characters to life and with the strong cast that we've got in this film that was always going to be a 'done' deal.I only realised after I'd watched The Great Escape that there was a documentary on after it which depicted the real Great Escape. I only wished that I'd spotted it as I would have really liked to have watched it (particularly so after watching this excellent film).This is a film that I would recommend to everyone. I knew nothing of the history behind this film so I found it particularly clever and entertaining.

It is somewhat sobering to me, he was the same age then as my grandson is now. Time marches on.This whole story, covering roughly three years from 1941 to 1944, is based on a memoire. It is in substance all true, including the 335 foot tunnel, although some names are changed and some characters are composites.The movie is long, at almost three hours, but it moves along interestingly. I watched it streaming on Prime, in four sittings over several days, much as if it had been a mini-series.Good movie for the time and events it represents.",,Anonymous,History
Excellent War Pic with one huge flaw,"The Motorbike Steve McQueen uses to try and jump the wall is a 1948 Triumph Speed Twin. How it got to a German POW camp in 1944 mystifies me. McQueen a Motot bike enthusiast would have known this. I wonder what the story behind the use of the bike is, anyone out there know?? Apart from this flaw it's a great movie!!",,Anonymous,History
"'Hilts' ""The Cooler King""","This not a review as much. I have read two books and watched a PBS Documentary on ""The Great Escape"". My focus is on Steve McQueen's portrayal of 'Hilt' ""The Cooler King"". The 1st book I read on this wonderful story was a little known accurate account biography written by Colonel Jerry Sage titled ""SAGE"". It is by all accounts the factual story of Col. Sage that McQueen portrayed as Capt. Hilt in the film. For dramatics the motorcycle jump of that barbed wire fence never happened but hey, that's Hollywood. I am privileged to know the niece of the late Col. Sage. The 2nd book was the popular Paul Brickhill tale. The PBS documentary of the ""GREAT ESCAPE"" blew me away. At the filming there were I believe 3 surviving men and when they found the actual tunnels after days of digging two of the items found were the bellows they manufactured for oxygen and get this, the belt buckle of one of surviving witnesses. I hope to locate this film again. Thank you Pvt Wm. J. E. U.S.M.C. Ret.",,Anonymous,History
Stunt Work by McQueen is Fabulous,"Not one of the best WWII films of all time but certainly entertaining with some excellent set pieces to remember.  Made in the days when many long epic films consisted of all star casts.  An enjoyable film from director, John Stuges that I prefer over his Western, The Magnificent Seven(1960).  The Great Escape(1963) has an interesting premise that is half realized.  One actor, James Donald plays a POW prisoner for the second time in five years after playing a similar role in Bridge on the River Kwai(1958).",,Anonymous,History
McQueen's Heroes,"After all the positive things I've heard about this movie, I finally sat down and checked it out. I was very disappointed. I was hoping for a serious, realistic WWII flick. Maybe not as heavy as Escape From Sorbibor, but something that was closer to reality than this. What the heck kind of Nazi prison camp is this? Obviously this was the inspiration for ""Hogan's Heroes"". I for one wasn't in the mood for wise cracking Americans and wacky NAZIs.",,Anonymous,History

Love the music to this film and the acting is good everything just good about this film and gets me excited everytime i watch it but for the cast think put to much american actors in this film should off been all star british cast.Don't know what eles to say but its really great film and everyone should watch it. 10/10,,Anonymous,History
