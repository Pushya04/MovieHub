Extraordinary performance from Christian Bale,"I had put off watching this until recently, I do not know why, I had not read reviews and for some reason imagined it to be a movie about a young Japanese prince(!!).I was captivated by the performance of Christian Bale as a privileged young boy named Jim Graham, growing up in Shanghai, very far removed from the poverty and despair all around him. When war breaks out, this changes him forever and hence the story.After some harrowing experiences he winds up in a prisoner of war camp where he befriends some interesting characters and quickly adapts to a life of conniving and subterfuge to survive.The transformation of Jim is beautifully captured, Steven Spielberg is a gifted director of child actors and gets a maximum performance always.I was enthralled from beginning to end, young Jim was forever changed by his experiences and this change is portrayed starkly here when he is finally reunited with his parents.8 out of 10 for equally impressive performances from John Malkovich and Miranda Richardson, but Christian Bale's performance deserved an Oscar.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Extraordinary film,"Reading through the reviews, there were a lot of people who didn't understand this film.  This is Spielberg's venture into the realm of art in cinematography.  This film is a visual masterpiece and you are swept along from beginning to end.  Yes, the tale gets a bit loose in spots and you never know what's going to happen next.  But, if you're willing to give up warm and fuzzy for lush visual images and startling leaps of character, you'll see what Spielberg's trying to accomplish.  This film makes use of the talents of Miranda Richardson and gives some early exposure to the likes of John Malkovich and Ben Stiller, but young Christian Bale steals the show. The reviewer that commented on the ""gothic"" effect of the Tai-Pan's going to the costume ball being driven through Shanghai was right on.  This film is rife with such scenes and does not disappoint.  It's wholly misleading to look for some kind of action story underlying this film.  The tale, taken from the book, is straightforward enough:  a young boy's boost into manhood through the second world war.  The film is full of memorable moments and visually very, very pleasing.  As art, it is excellent.  That's likely why it wasn't a blockbuster, as say, e.g., Poltergeist, Close Encounters and the Jurassic Park films, were.  But, hey.  That's the cost of creating art as opposed to crap. And, crap does draw a lot of flies...",8.0,Anonymous,History
An Underrated Classic,"In 1987 Steven Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun"" opened to mixed reviews and disappointing box office returns. But the film's reputation has grown with time, and it's now rightfully considered an underrated Spielberg classic. ""Empire of the Sun"" tells the true story of Jim Ballard, an English boy who's separated from his parents in China during World War II. Featuring an excellent performance from the young Christian Bale, ""Empire of the Sun"" is an emotional and visually striking drama about loss, family, and the horror of war. Spielberg also uses Ballard's story to address thought-provoking questions about social privilege, militarism, and the lengths that humans will go to in order to survive. Spielberg doesn't provide easy answers to these questions, making this one of his more mature and contemplative works.Having seen ""Empire of the Sun"" multiple times, I've grown to deeply appreciate it as both a sweeping historical epic and a powerful tale of a traumatic childhood. The movie isn't perfect - at two and a half hours it's too long. The second act in particular drags and this causes the movie to lose much of its dramatic momentum halfway through. But despite its length ""Empire of the Sun"" does more than enough to maintain your interest with compelling performances, amazing visuals, and of course John Williams' award winning score. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
From a Japanese girl,"This is the first time I commented on a film. I saw this yesterday night for the first time. And I just cried.I cried for Jim. I cried for the pain our country caused in the innocent civilians. (Japan can be so stupid!) I cried for the pilots of the Zero-sen.I've read and seen lots of movies of these pilots. They're called tokoutai in Japanese. They get on their planes knowing they will die. It's a suicide mission, and they were very proud of it. I know if you're on the winning side you may not sympathize these pilots, but they were just fighting for their country. In those days, the emperor was everything. They taught you to die for the emperor at school when you were only in 1st grade.But I don't know the war. I've never experienced it. I can't understand the concept of dying for your emperor. So I sympathise with Jim. Jim is a symbol. A symbol of innocence, of the horrors of war. His singing proves that too. He's also the ray of light for these prisoners. His energy and vitality are important aspects. It brings out some human characteristics in the sergent as well.Christian Bale was remarkable. He should be commemorated or something for this performance, cause it was just brilliant. So was John Malcovich.Overall it was great. One of the best movies I ever saw. It made me think, a lot. About war, about Japan, about history, and about humans in general.",,Anonymous,History
Survivng life when your world has been turned upside down.,"I saw this movie 17 years ago as a ten year old in the theater and saw it again for the first time since then last night on a TV movie channel. I have to say I'm almost ashamed that I forgot what a great movie this was...what a great movie it still is. The film contains parts very competently played by the then relatively un-knowns John Malkovic, Joey ""Pants"" and Ben Stiller. The lead was played, and very well done at that, by a then young actor Christian Bales (sp?). The acting in this movie is fantastic and the story line is is as rich as any other of the best movies I've seen. Following the trials and tribulations of a child from an affluent family separated from his parents in China after the Japanese invasion. This movie will make you angry, it will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will frustrate the living daylights out of you and in the end you'll feel warm and fuzzy: but the hollow kind of warm and fuzzy that only comes after a very harrowing experience. If you don't like war movies don't worry!!! When you watch this film you'll see it's not as much of a war movie as it is a story of survival and the brutal realities of life when the world has been turned upside down. The movie really spoke to me partially b/c I was a young kid when I first saw it and the main character is also a young man. However, this movie also spoke to me on a much different, deeper level. Ever since I was child I was always fortunate/blessed enough to have my family along with everything I needed and most of what I wanted. This movie depicts what happens when all of those familiar things and creature comforts are taken away...it makes you ask yourself: What would I do in this situation? How would I react? A fantastic movie for almost all ages!!!",10.0,Anonymous,History
I'm appalled this didn't win any of 6 Oscars it was nominated for,"Empire of the Sun is masterfully directed, cinematography, music and acting are phenomenal! So nice to see young Christian Bale in this whirlwind of adventurous war drama. A captivating piece of cinema that is thrilling entertainment throughout about the brits and Japanese. John Malkovich is one of the best actors ever; so is Joe Panatolio I appreciate any project they're in.

A Movie Of Great Moments Without Being A Great Movie,"From Spring Of 1940 to the Summer of 1941 Britain experienced "" Its finest hour "" where an island people found itself fighting alone against Nazi Germany and fascist Italy . We experienced Dunkirk , the blitz , the battle of Britain and 36,000 British and commonwealth troops held back a force of 400,000 Italian troops in North Africa . If Britain had accepted the Nazi peace deal on offer the history of the human race would have been entirely different and not in a good way either . Ironically after this zenith of British courage we went onto lose the peace which is something we've been resentful about ever sinceI'm being neither nostalgic nor nostalgic when I point out the above . It's just in the early scenes of EMPIRE OF THE SUN the Brits in China are shown as being arrogant , ignorant phillistines who all live in nice big houses . Maybe this might have been true of those Brits living in ivory towers running the empire but it's an atypical view of the average Brit during the second world war . I might have let it pass but seeing as the director's Steven Spielberg who insists on always casting British actors to play Nazis in all his movies and who put the boot into Monty in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN I can't help thinking he's somewhat Anglophobic . Read my opening paragraph and you'll learn more about Britain in the second world war than you will from seeing this movieThere's other flaws in the screenplay ( Written by Tom Stoppard who's not an American by the way ) which people have noticed . It is rather disjointed and episodic . The audience is shown the events of the Japanese Imperial Army invading Shanghai in 1941 where all the Westerners are put into a holding camp then events jump forward almost FOUR years later where the prisoners are held in an internment camp . What ? Nothing of any interest has happened in four years ? Some critics have also mentioned the rather clich√©d characters and I agree . The Brits are all rather stiff upper lipped types while the Yanks have a cheeky extrovert attitude with plenty of scams going on . Did the Americans have a monopoly on scams during the war ? I also have serious reservations on the way the Japanese are portrayed in this movie . When Alexander Solzhenitsyn said "" The only difference between the Nazis and the communists is that the Nazis used gas "" it's a statement that could have been used to describe the Japanese occupation forces of the 1930s and 40s , but here they're shown as noble warriors ( I don't dispute the raw courage of the Japanese of the time but there's nothing noble about mass murder ) who salute the young James . If the author of the book JG Ballard said it this scene happened then it happened but I do have many reservations about the Japanese portrayalThere are many positive aspects to EMPIRE OF THE SUN . Technically it's very good with some fine scenes like the above saluting scene and the mustang flying over the internment camp with the pilot waving to young James in slow motion and the scene where the young protagonist believes he can resurrect his dead friend but for me the best scene is where Basie is allowed onto a truck where he turns his back on James who is left behind in a heart wrenching moment . It's these moments that linger long in the memory and certainly make EMPIRE OF THE SUN a far better regarded film than it certainly deserves to beIt's also a film with a very good cast who rise above the material . It's surprising to think this now but when the movie was released in 1987 both Nigel Havers and Miranda Richardson where only known for their sit com roles. Richardson ( So awful in BLACKADDER 2 ) is very good here and went onto to become more or less Britain's best actress in the early 1990s and there's early screen appearances by Joe Panoliano , Ben Stiller ( Yes that one ) and Paul McGann . Despite playing an irritating character ( And characters don't come anymore irritating than a 14 year old boy with a bi-polar disorder ) Christian Bale is excellent and it's nice to know he still gets regular employment as an adult actor . The only disappointment is John Malkovich but I've never been a fan of his "" Stoned Jack Nicolson "" type of acting and like I said he does appear in the movie's best sceneEMPIRE OF THE SUN has it's moments but that's all they are - moments . They stay in the mind making you believe that it's a far better movie than it actually is . It's not by any stretch of the imagination a bad or even average film but it's not a masterpiece either . Perhaps the fact that it was nominated for several Oscars ( None of which were for best film or director ) but failed to win any shows up it's true worth",7.0,Anonymous,History
A great adventure for a child,"I can see that a tale told from a child's point of view how it would stir the imagination of one Steven Spielberg. Empire Of The Sun is a really imaginative story of a young boy stuck in World War II China in a truly terrible situation cut off from his parents. Yet young Christian Bale turns the whole thing gradually into an adventure of sorts.Up to the age of 11 young Bale has lived in the British quarter of Shanghai and in fact has never seen the United Kingdom, his father Rupert Frazer owns a textile factory. Bale and his parents live in luxury among the millions of Chinese.What one should remember when watching Empire Of The Sun is that since the Opium War of 1841 western powers and Japan joined them took small little nibbles out of China and in fact were granted by the weak Chinese governments special treatment in their quarters. Frazer, Emily Richard his wife and young Bale lived under British law and did not answer to the Chinese. The other powers did the same, even the USA had its own quarter in Shanghai as well as other large Chinese cities. That only ended with the Communist takeover in 1949.It ended a bit prematurely for the west in 1941 when the Japanese attacked America, Great Britain, the Netherlands. That's when Bale's well ordered world falls apart.I had to marvel at how when Bale came home and the parents were gone and some looting had occurred how his reactions were. Without any dialog Bale runs through a gamut of emotions. Great job of acting and directing.Later on Bale is rounded up and taken to an internment camp next to an airfield. Fascinating how Bale who had an interest in aviation looks at the Japanese planes and become almost worshipful of the enemy. He even makes friend with some of the Japanese, a group not known for treating prisoners well in World War II.Joe Pantoliano and John Malkovich are a pair of American adventurers, no better than they ought to be. They're caught along with Bale and sent to the internment camp. Our adult eyes see them as a pair of bottom feeders. But we see them through the child's eyes also and they become sort of devil may care rogues that one reads in pulp fiction the kind Bale no doubt read.Steven Spielberg did a marvelous job of recreating wartime China and it certainly helped to shoot the film there. Just part of the People's Republic's post Mao entry into the community of nations.The adult performers are fine. Empire Of The Sun got a flock of Oscar nominations in technical categories, no gold though. But it did inaugurate the career of Christian Bale who's done pretty well for himself as an adult actor too.This one is highly recommended for its realism and encouragement of imagination.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"an episodic story laced with David Lean influence, impressive sights, though not enough","Empire of the Sun must have been something that made Steven Spielberg all the more excited to work on being that, before each film he directs, he watches four specific films- The Searchers, Seven Samurai, It's a Wonderful Life, and Lawrence of Arabia- the latter of those four, and the fact that Lean originally intended to direct this film, indicate how he wanted to go with the style, the sprawling and epic tone. But if in the end I didn't feel as totally satisfied as I thought I should (it's been called one of the most underrated films of Spielberg/the 80's), it might be that parts become more interesting and worth watching than for the whole. Acting-wise the two main forces in the film, one a young, brilliant-as-a-child actor Christian Bale embodies Jamie/Jim as a kid who does go through a transformation, the typical 'coming-of-age' where he loses more than just his parents in the chaos but part of himself. The other is John Malkovich, who plays the surrogate/friend during war-time to the boy, a more hard-edged but sharp guy who's out for himself but not completely shut-off from others.And as with any given Spielberg film, at least one or two visuals will strike up as being pretty close to what could be called ""pure cinema"", where you feel a kind of rush on the back of your neck at what can be done with color, light, composition, people (optional), and music. One of these might be in the first hour of the film- maybe my favorite chunk for just consistency- as Jamie first goes through the toughest part, put into the disillusionment of his fantasies of aircrafts and flying and out on his own. Jamie gets lost from his parents in a massive sea of a crowd in the city, and it's a reminder how astounding Spielberg can be with the control of it all, and how every detail adds up to an emotional toll. Once Ballard's original story (based on truth, how much I don't know) reaches into the prison camp, it becomes spotty; sometimes parts of the story work, and sometimes they don't and become a little dramatically inert. Never does Spielberg completely lose his craftsmanship, but there's something not there. Part of it might be the excision of the main chunk of war years (1941 right to 1945 in a fade), but another part of it might be somethings that just ring a little more to the sentimental than Spielberg might realize.When Jim, for example, sees the Japanese fliers on the airfield in some minor ceremony, and he starts to sing his old choir-boy song, it just didn't seem right after such better, smaller scenes between Malkovich and Bale. Still, through this Spielberg does provide another point of great cinema, in the shot that inspired the poster of the towering sun with the plane flying across it. It's little rousing moments like this that do make the film worth seeing, but if you're coming into it after already seeing many of his great works (Schindler, Private Ryan, Munich), the real devastation from being in this situation is never as fully realized as past some kind of brighter nostalgia. There are some darker moments, but it never adds up, and certainly not from the point of view of a conflicted boy who goes through this experience of Japanese internment like Lawrence in a small way- he's a little mad, though courageous. But through Spielberg's own epic ambitions, there's something lost with really making it entertaining. It's bound to find more viewers as the years go on, and it was unfairly maligned upon its original release. Yet the irony doesn't escape me that it is sort of a minor work for the director, working on a huge canvas of locales, extras, and actors both Western and Eastern.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"A visual masterpiece, very moving and thought-provoking and Christian Bale is extraordinary","I do like a vast majority of Steven Spielberg's movies, and Empire of the Sun I feel is one of his best, alongside Schindler's List, ET, Jaws, Jurassic Park and Raiders of the Lost Ark. Spielberg's direction is superb, and there is a thoughtful script and very touching story. Empire of the Sun also has characters that I personally did care for, pacing that didn't feel too rushed and glacial and the acting from the likes of Miranda Richardson, Nigel Havers and John Malkovich is truly terrific. Three assets especially stand out. Empire of the Sun like all of Spielberg's movies is a triumph when it comes to visuals, the cinematography, lighting, scenery and effects are all lovingly crafted. John Williams' score is also fantastic and enhances the drama, not his most iconic of his scores, that would be a three-way tie between Jaws, Schindler's List and ET, it serves its purpose very well. Lastly, Christian Bale is absolutely extraordinary in this film, I do like him very much as an actor, but I don't think I have ever seen him this powerful or poignant. Overall, a wonderful movie and one of my personal favourites from Spielberg. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,History
well made Spielberg,"While Japan is conquering China, foreigners live in the Shanghai International Settlement oblivious to the suffering. Jamie Graham (Christian Bale) is a spoiled British upper class schoolboy. In the chaos of the Japanese taking Shanghai, Jamie's parents lose him in the crowd. He goes home to find his servants stealing the valuables. He is found by Basie (John Malkovich) and Frank Demarest (Joe Pantoliano) who are also stranded in Shanghai. He is taken to an assembly center along with Basie who teaches him how to survive. In the camp, Jamie lives with the Victors.Spielberg is a master of a child's wonderment. That's what he does here. Despite the movie's subject matter, it never gets to be truly disturbing or ugly. He always pulls back a little earning its PG rating. Jamie can be an annoying spoiled brat. At times, he seems to be deliberately dense. Christian Bale does an amazing acting job. It is a wonderfully shot movie.

"Very emotional film, with brilliant young Christian Bale.","Empire of the Sun, I have just revisited this film on DVD and was amazed the effect it left on me. This is almost an unknown film relative to most other Spielberg work. The DVD is not even available in Australia, so I had it 'Amazoned' from the US.Christian Bales performance as the 12 year old Jim is mesmerizing. He is in virtually every scene of the 2.5 hour movie and gives us the full range of emotions. He also one of the best looking kids I've seen, which add tremendously to the viewing appeal of the movie. A true heart throb in the making.As a history lesson Empire give us an insight to the happenings in China in WWII, and the ambitions of the Japanese Empire, which are never touched on in other WWII movies.The most emotional part of the film for me: Jim is looking through the fence at the Japanese airbase, the sun is setting, he is dreaming of flying in those incredible machines, pilots are smartly uniformed and decorated, offices passing drinks to the young pilots, superb music playing, Zeros ready to go, Jim salutes the Japanese heroes as they are flying out. What we know is that the war is lost for Japan and these pilots are surely on Kamikaze suicide missions. We feel great empathy for these fellow human beings despite the fact that they are the enemy.The images in Empire are beautiful to look at, the movie is thought provoking and provide some history lesson, if somewhat fantasy and sacrine sweet. A behind the scenes war movie with heart. My favourite Spielberg movie and in my top 15 of all time. Other favourites in no order.

Unfairly neglected and despised - not least by me,"I adored ""Empire of the Sun"" when I first saw it.  I was seventeen; I had only recently discovered how some movies could grow, looking richer and better on repeated viewings, and I fully expected this one to, as well.So naturally I was disappointed when, instead of growing, it shrunk.  The streetwise American proved to be a fairly stale character - he began to look as if Spielberg was simultaneously reaching for the cynical American in ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", and Han Solo, and failing to grasp either.  And the central character, I noticed, undergoes a hell of a lot: war breaks out over his head, he loses his parents during an outbreak of mass panic, he nearly starves, he's imprisoned by the Japanese and rescued by the Americans - and what, then, is the moral of it all?  That people change.  The story is a good deal less interesting than I first took it to be.Well, I now realise, so what.  It's not the film's fault that I first saw it when I was seventeen.  The whole may be less than the sum of the parts, but the sum of the parts is a pretty big sum.  There's that wonderful extended sequence, which lasts from when Jim loses his parents until he (and I admit that this part is a turn for the worse) meets the American: for a while it looks as if Spielberg cannot set a foot wrong.  The way he returns to his old house and haunts it like a ghost.  The way one of his old Chinese servants stops packing, methodically walks over to him, slaps him across the face, and then resumes her packing.  It was the most economical way of getting through to the boy, it needed to be done, she'd wanted to do it for a while - and having done it ONCE, she could now move on to other things. The latter stretch of the movie, while disappointing, continued to serve up moments like these.  The cinematography is a delight throughout, and not just because these are pretty pictures.  Spielberg uses flawless images and cold, starry music to distance us from the scenes of war and privation and death and this is, I think his finest achievement: the whole film takes on the quality of vivid memories of things that cannot now be altered.Apparently David Lean tried and failed to turn J.G. Ballard's book into a film - and indeed it looks as if Spielberg, too, tried and failed to make a David Lean film.  But Lean soars so high there's plenty of room for others to fly beneath him without crashing.  It may be the influence of Lean that makes the best film Spielberg made between ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Schindler's List"".  It's a far better study in war than ""Saving Private Ryan"".  That film is as cheap and unsubtle as can be: it shocks us with blood and guts, then wears us down with inane spoken platitudes.  ""Empire of the Sun"" lets us conclude the nature of the horror, and draw lessons, for ourselves.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A disconnected experience,"""Empire of the Sun"" is an awkward and uncomfortable film. Spielberg is usually very good at melding character interaction with the cinematography and music, but in ""Empire,"" it's as if these elements are working against each other. Since all of the characters are at a distance, not fleshed out enough or both, it never seems like the sentimental direction or the evocative score are appropriate. What should be an expression of the characters' turmoil ends up feeling like obvious overcompensation. The best parts of the movie are the memorable visuals - the sparks flying from a WWII plane in particular - but like everything else in the film, the overbearing direction and music either dilutes the effect or feels out of place.",5.0,Anonymous,History
ASTOUNDING,"I came across this film while I was flipping through the channels on my t.v. This is truly an astounding film. The inimitable dialogue, the dazzling scenes, and most importantly the profundity of its premise make this film unforgettable and worthy of sycophantic obsession. I was completely enraptured by the brilliant acting. I believe this is Steven Spielberg's most noteworthy film. His other movies pale in comparison to this one. John Malkovich and Christian Bale are incredible as usual, but in this film they bring to life a story of a boy who loses everything due to a country trying to conquer everything. The physical and mental destruction of war and the injurious effects of loneliness are very clich√©d themes, but this film conveys them in an incomparable way. This is undoubtedly one of my favorite films, and I suggest that everyone take the time to watch it. It would be exceedingly foolish of one to not watch it.",,Anonymous,History

a good look at the issues of the setting,"Based on J.G. Ballard's autobiography, ""Empire of the Sun"" portrays spoiled English boy Jim Graham (Christian Bale) getting taken prisoner by the Japanese army in WWII-era Shanghai. In the POW camp, he meets several American POWs and is forced to totally grow up.You really see how good this movie is when you understand the issues that it portrays. All of these foreign powers were trying to colonize China. The British felt that they could just live there with no fear; they were oblivious to the coming of the Japanese army. Some really good scenes show Jim in the choir (showing how the English were trying to continue their lifestyle), and then as his family is driving home, they drive past a homeless Chinese man, a reminder of the effects of colonialism. One important point is that the men whom Jim gets to know in the POW camp are not particularly desirable men; specifically, Basie (John Malkovich) is sort of a pirate. The point is that this experience forces him to grow up. In his debut, Ben Stiller also plays one of the American POWs.All in all, ""Empire of the Sun"" is a great movie. Steven Spielberg accomplished another masterpiece here. Not to be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,History
empire of the sun,"It's been awhile since I've seen this film...thirty six years, to be exact...and I'd forgotten how good it is when it's good. The first hour is Spielberg at his best as we are given a searing vision of a city being invaded, made all the more harrowing since it is seen through the wondering, terrified eyes of an eleven year old. There are many scenes that linger in the mind from this first hour. Perhaps the most indelible for me is when the kid is suddenly and shockingly slapped by his servant. I'm not usually a big fan of movie slaps. I find them cheaply gratuitous. Not this one. The fall of the British empire as well as the fall of innocence is in that blow.Then, for the next two and a half hours, come the prison camp scenes and the film turns increasingly cerebral and inward. And Spielberg is, to put it kindly, not a cerebral or an inward director. The result is a feeling of, to use an appropriate aerial metaphor (LOTS of planes in this pic), things stalling out. And when a movie loses its energy it is not long until old man boredom comes a calling.So let's give it a generous B minus for the first hour, Malkovich's wonderful Milo Minderbinder turn, Allen Daviou's beautiful (maybe too much so) cinematography and John Williams' hauntingly lovely theme.PS...As for Christian Bale, what can you say? His performance isn't so much good or bad but simply amazing. I mean, this thirteen year old kid is in every friggin scene of a nearly three hour movie. And not once does he threaten to mess up the movie. If not the Oscar, he deserved some kind of medal.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Awesome...Bale's performance brought me to tears...,"EMPIRE OF THE SUN is a gem of movie-making. Visually arresting from start to finish, given a sumptuous musical score by John Williams and some of the finest cinematography ever seen, it is hard to understand why the film is not as highly acclaimed as it ought to be...nor is it fitting that it was nominated for six Academy Awards but received none.It's a sweeping epic but depends on capturing your interest by giving the main burden to the young Christian Bale who certainly has one of the great child roles of a lifetime as Jim--and becomes the character so completely that his final reunion with his parents brings tears to the eyes. By that time, the viewer has been through so much with him, watching as he grows from spoiled rich kid to a wily boy who must fend for himself among the wolf-pack of prisoners interred by the Japanese.Basically, it's the real life story of one boy's survival during the outbreak of World War II when he is separated from his British parents during the evacuation of Shanghai. It is a spectacularly staged evacuation scene that is topped throughout by other scenes of visual splendor and poignant moments that stay in the memory long after the film is over. The boy's fascination with the beauty of planes and the horrors of war are well documented--as is his strange fascination with the Japanese and his doomed friendship with a Japanese boy.The film falls squarely on the shoulders of Christian Bale, so much so that the supporting players are never fully fleshed characters. However, all of them within a limited range--including John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson and Nigel Havers--do magnificent jobs. Steven Spielberg's direction cannot be faulted. He has given us a closeup glimpse of war and its effect on people that can only be rivaled by his later masterwork, SCHINDLER'S LIST.Technically, the film is a brilliant achievement in all of its World War II details. And Christian Bale certainly deserved an Oscar for what has to be one of the strongest performances ever given by a child actor, with never a false step, every nuance just perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Over-the-top drama that is good looking and well acted but that I never really enjoyed watching.,"Just because the movie is good looking and directed by one of the best movie directors of all time doesn't automatically mean that the movie itself is good as well. ""Empire of the Sun"" has a slow story that isn't always told from the right perspective.Really the biggest problem of the movie is the perspective it is told from. The entire movie is told through the eyes of a child played by a young Christian Bale. Sure, Christian Bale is a great actor and he now is Batman and all, so people will only love him more in this movie now but that doesn't all mean that Christian Bale as a kid was good and strong enough to carry an entire movie on his own. And this movie is really about Christian Bale's character alone. There is nothing wrong with telling a story through the eyes of a child and it can work really powerful but a movie like that also needs a good supporting adult cast to give the movie more credibility and give the movie some more characters to relate with. The movie does has a great supporting cast (John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson, Joe Pantoliano and a young and 'serious' Ben Stiller in an early role.) but none of these actors are used consistent enough in the movie, with as a result that Christian Bale has to carry the entire movie on its own.Visually the movie is really spectacular to look at. The cinematography by Allen Daviau is magnificent and there are some well directed and good looking sequences in the movie. Also lets please not forget the brilliant musical score by John Williams that makes some of the sequences work extremely well and gives the movie some extra boost and power.The movie is not always correctly paced and there are some death moments in the movie were nothing really interesting ever happens. The movie does concentrate well on the emotions and feelings of especially the young boy Jim/Jamie but that doesn't always make the movie interesting to watch. It has never really been a movie that I particularly enjoyed watching, because of the at times low pace and narrow minded and very one-person sided perspective the movie is told from.In its emotions and dramatic moments, the movie really goes over-the-top at times. The movie can be seen as an over-dramatized one that doesn't always is believable in its story. There is some typical and predictable Spielberg sentimental stuff in the movie. The over-the-top level of this movie does provide the movie with some wonderful and unforgettable sequences but at the same time its a killer for the story and the movie its credibility.Yes the movie is perfectly watchable and its beautiful looking and all but the story and perspective makes this not really a movie that I like to watch. One of Spielberg's lesser movies. I'm sure that the book is great though! But the story doesn't really work in a movie.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,History
EPIC MASTERPIECE,A BEAUTIFUL film in every sense of the word. The brutality of war is matched by the wit and wisdom of a 12 year old boy. Do not hesitate to emerge yourself in this Spielberg epic masterpiece.,10.0,Anonymous,History
Near immaculately put together wartime tale about a boy winding up on a front-line of poverty and hard times.,"Empire of the Sun is a gruelling child orientated character piece which taps into a child's fear of isolation as well as going all out in being a thoroughly engrossing war drama with a keen eye on depicting the horrors such an event. The film will begin and end with that of a container, of sorts, floating easily along a water way. They are, however, two very different containers carrying very different things and yet are intrinsically linked by the fact that what they possess are effectively deceased and gone. Where coffins housing the dead line a river during the opening few shots, a small suitcase in possession of the belongings held throughout by that of a certain character is seen gently floating off and away; the image signifying times having moved on, that the 'old' character is gone and a new, more-exposed-to-the-world in ways which would have never normally happened, is here.That character is Jamie Graham, played by Christian Bale; an infant initially living in the Chinese city of Shanghai just prior to Japan's attack on the American naval base at Pearl Harbour and as a consequence, the majority of the Pacific's nations official entry into World War Two. He lives an affluent life with his rich parents, a blazer-clad boy singing harmoniously in a church when we first see him and later chauffeured back to a huge manor house in a neighbourhood firmly informing us of how he lives. What is more revealing, however, is the trawl home through the grime of some of the less desirable places native to the country; paupers and beggars, one of whom sits outside the property, sharing eye contact with Jamie in a reflective moment like they were from separate planets.Jamie loves his aeroplanes, and upon finding a downed fighter in a field during a function some miles away, clambers into it so as to enthusiastically act out war-games as if the pilot. Said notion is often found in war films which mistake acts of warfare as processions of action, and thus ought to be shot or constructed as exciting when the harsh reality of the subject is that they're anything but. Spielberg's film is more a project depicting someone taken from their bubbled existence and thrust into a limelight of real wartime poverty and survival thus forcing reflection. Events cause the film to progress into what is essentially a prisoner of war movie, but a prisoner of war film keeping clear of sugar coating such a situation and doing well to maintain a sense of causality mired down in the turgidness and ugliness of a wartime scenario moreover the bouncy, joyous one more inclined to rear up when escape is the sole purpose of the film's exercise.Once everything has happened away from where we are, and the Japanese have formally invaded this territory given their entry into the war, Jamie is separated from his parents in a street-set panic so returns to his home for a series of scenes shot as if the apocalypse has just happened or a nationwide epidemic has occurred forcing isolation and hiding. What is impressive is how the film goes about depicting Jamie's central transition, a film full of extended sequences and unbroken takes of young Jamie stumbling through a series of post invasion streets as he evades thieves his age and strives for aid in places he will not find it. In the background, things are blurred and the choice of angles at specific times are effective. Later on, things will appear to aesthetically 'normalise', as inceptions give way to a getting used to this newfound existence, it is through Americans Frank Demarest (Pantoliano) and John Malkovich's Basie; a seaman who lives out of a wrecked freighter in a harbour Jamie finds his feet.When one thinks back to Spielberg's oeuvre, specifically from that of the 1980s, Empire of the Sun is not the film which immediately comes to mind, and that is a shame - although not as much as the fact that the likes of 1984's Temple of Doom might very well do instead. It slots into a canon of around the time, let's say beginning in 1982 with E.T. and ending with Hook in 1991, depicting children or even children being exposed to a rawer situation than what was already evident in their lives ‚Äì when the movies Spielberg is churning out aren't made with a childlike enthusiasm, he seems to be able to get into the lives of minors and pull off the depicting of their plights; plights which carry that uneasy sense of both adventure and awe at their finding themselves in an unparallelled situation in a far off place, but fear of what is essentially the unknown. In Empire of the Sun, Spielberg veers off and away into a depiction of such things more inclined to being as good as his tale of a young boy coming into contact with an alien in E.T. than he does explore the freewheeling emotions of a young boy caught up in an adventure akin to Indiana Jones' in Temple of Doom, or indeed any of the child characters in the aforementioned Hook. It is a well played, meticulously unfolded piece clocking in at two hours but without a moment that either drags nor doesn't feels somewhat unsettling.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"""Empire of the Sun""","Before he was chopping up prostitutes on Wall Street, Christian Bale was the boy standing on top of an air-traffic control tower, cheering as American bombers laid waste to the airstrip of the Japanese POW camp he was currently a resident of. As a pampered British boy named Jim ""Jamie"" Graham who is separated from his parents following the fall of Shanghai before American involvement in World War II, Bale is simply astounding. A young performer at 12, he is forced to grow up fast as a prisoner of the ruling Japanese forces, making friends wherever he can, including American Basie (John Malkovich), his pal Frank (Joe Pantoliano), and even the young Kamikaze pilot who lives in the barracks on the other side of the fence. ""Empire of the Sun,"" an adaptation of the novel by J.G. Ballard, is often cited as one of director Steven Spielberg's weakest films, but I beg to differ. It is well known that he has a special place in his heart for WWII, and it's something he loves and loathes. It's a coming-of-age tale that really understands the grueling nature of the reality it depicts, and despite its ""PG"" rating, is still something for a mature audience. We're with Jamie the entire way, who is only 12, remember, yet he has already seen enough to last a lifetime. The only major gripe with this picture is its running time, and some scenes do tend to drag on for far too long, but that's only a minor grievance in a tale that is truly epic.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,History
Somehow Remains Unengaging,"Steven Spielberg's bid for serious filmmaker consideration in the 1980s continued with this 1987 release, hot on the heels of his well received ""The Color Purple."" ""Empire of the Sun"" bombed at the time, and all these years later it's easy to understand why. For all his gifts at crafting arresting visual images, of which there are many in ""Empire of the Sun,"" and for being able to stage exciting set pieces, which we all knew he could do almost better than anyone else, this movie feels weirdly inert and unengaging. Spielberg simply can't, or at least couldn't then, explore serious and realistic topics without imposing his brand of boyish whimsy. The result makes for an incongruous mashup of historical drama and adventure movie, neither completely one or the other. And when he flexes his artistic muscles, which he tries to do often in this film, the movie verges into incoherency. There are whole sections of the movie where I wasn't clear who was who, or what was happening, or why prisoners were still meandering around the internment camp when it had seemed to be liberated in the scene just before.After practically slapping Spielberg in the face by snubbing him in 1985 for Best Director despite nominating ""The Color Purple"" for 11 Oscars, they stuck it to him again, if less egregiously and more deservedly this time around, by nominating ""Empire of the Sun"" for 6 Oscars and sending it home empty handed. It was up for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound, and lost every single award to ""The Last Emperor.""Grade: B.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Horrible movie with even worse playing of history,"Somehow, I don't understand why Spielberg chose to make this movie.  It was essentially a prison camp movie but why set it in China?  If it is in China, then why is it about white people?  In the entire movie, the Japanese are glorified as a warrior nation, while the Chinese are portrayed as dirty people.  If Spielberg wanted to make a prison camp movie, he should have just skipped to Schindler's List or make a movie about a REAL prison camp perhaps.  It seemed like Spielberg simply wanted to make a movie in China, since he haven't done so before.  But Spielberg decides to completely neglect the real victims in the war, the Chinese, and decide to make a movie about a tiny minority that was stupid enough to still pursue their imperialistic fortunes even at a time of war.Some historical concerns.  In the beginning of the movie, it states that China and Japan has been in 4 years of undeclared war already, therefore the starting scene was set in 1941.  Shanghai fell in 1937.  Also, Shanghai fell only after the largest battle of WW2, the Battle of Shanghai, and in the movie it seemed like the Japanese all of a sudden walked into the city and caught everyone by surprise.  The Battle of Shanghai took 3 months!  You would think people would know to get out of Shanghai by now, especially Westerners who had the means and a place to go, BACK HOME!  Also, Shanghai was liberated by the Nationalist army, not by Americans, but whatever, its a Hollywood movie.  This movie only had a couple historical mistakes because there was only a couple scenes of history in it!  The prison camp could have been anywhere, anytime, any war, just change the subjugators.  The scenary of the camp was also bland and generic enough to make you think it was filmed in Bakerfield.  The generic camp also made the movie completely generic.  All this makes you wonder, why China?  If China, why this?  It's not like the China war had much movies made about it.  Spielberg could have made much better movies with China in WW2 as the background, such as something about the Nanking Massacre, or the Chinese defense against the Japanese, or even the American ""flying tigers"".  Instead Spielberg chose the most unrealistic and obscure nook to make a grand epic about.  Baffling. The movie itself was bland except for the boy, who made you wonder if he had gone crazy from the change around him.  One minute he was a pampered kid from a western imperialist family, the next he was a refugee, although still better treated than the Chinese.  Atleast he wasn't shot immediately on sight.  Watching this movie makes me sad about how the world is treating the 2nd Sino-Japanese war from 1937-45 as a forgotten war.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Very Dramatic and Intense Move with a Powerful Cast,","Empire of the Sun is a fantastic with a very well written and developed storyline and an outstanding and very dramatic cast.Its Steven Spielberg's first serious war film and while it isn't and good as the war related films he's given in more recent years (Schindlers List,Saving Private Ryan,etc.), it still is a great start for a director who has proved he can direct several different types of genres.The film cast is very professional, it's Christian Bale first big movie,he is very young in this movie and inexperienced but that dosen't show in this film,he delivers a very impressive performance,and that also goes for John Malcovich,another amazing actor,this being one if his earliest films.Fans of war films and Steven Spielberg definitely wouldn't want to miss Empire of the Sun.Story of a young boy who is forced to grow up quickly in a Japanese prisoner of war camp during World War 2.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Spielberg proves his chops with moving war story  from young boy's perspective,"A child's point of view can change your entire perspective. Steven Spielberg has always demonstrated a gift for bringing that child-like sense of wonder and working with young actors, most notably in writing ""The Goonies"" and directing ""E.T."" In ""Empire of the Sun,"" he shows us war-torn China and Japan through the eyes of a 12-year-old Christian Bale. The 1987 war epic marks the director's first of what would become several powerful war stories and only his second dramatic feature after ""The Color Purple.""There's maybe a split-second shot of some people on the street wearing swastikas, but otherwise, ""Empire of the Sun"" is not a ""same old"" World War II film. Considering the war films he's know for, kudos to Spielberg for focusing this story on one fraction of WWII and the survival of a young boy separated from his parents who is forced to lose his innocence in the throws of war.Jamie (Bale), lives in a lovely home with servants and his parents in Shanghai. He's lived there his whole life as the British have had a presence there for a long time. He has a wild imagination, loves airplanes and sees the world with rose-colored glasses as he ought to at his age. When the Japanese invade in December of '41, Jamie gets separated in the streets from his parents and begins a brutal journey that ultimately brings him to Soo Chow internment camp where he's known as Jim. He carves a new life for himself as a crafty and inspiring young man.Tom Stoppard, who had just received an Oscar nomination for Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil,"" doesn't provide an eventful script, but does create a compelling portrait of Jamie/Jim. His journey could rank as one of the most complete and intriguing child story lines in film history. Although the film is based on the semi-autobiographical novel by J.G. Ballard, Stoppard finds the key moments and visual symbols and metaphors to guide us through Jim's journey.At first Jim's painfully naive, running up to Japanese soldiers and shouting that he surrenders. Spielberg nearly convinces us he's going to get beat to death by one of them at any moment, but he's more so lost and clueless in these early stages. We watch Jim grow wiser throughout the film, or at least craftier and more tenacious, but Spielberg makes sure that he never looks or acts like a miniature adult. At a key, tender moment sometime in the bulk of the 150-minute film, Jim confesses through tears that he can't remember what his parents look like anymore. Neither can we -- it's been that kind of journey and we've been in Jim' shoes (a pair of golf shoes for much of the film) that whole time.Jim's outlook makes him an inspiring character, certainly one that adds refreshment to a war story that could have been and has been told in many ways using many different wars. This character arch is the winning feature of ""Empire of the Sun."" Little else nominates it for discussion among all-time great war films, but the perspective of a boy changes everything for the better.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Small Boy in a Great War.,"My Take: An imperfect, yet magnificent effort. Visually stunning and honestly tear-jerking.This is among my favorites in the war film genre. It clearly shows us the drama and power of WWII. What do you expect, Steven Spielberg directed it. It's supposed to be this wonderful, if not really perfect. Future Batman Christian Bale stars as a young boy named Jim ""Jaime"" Graham, who is separated from his parents, and kept inside a Japanese camp. His performance was great, even for a young actor who is less known at the time. John Malkovich and Miranda Richardson are great too. But among the things that stunned me in this movie is Spielberg realistic and stunning recreation of the great World War. The film is also wonderfully shot in Shanghai, capturing the the feel of being in the People's Republic of China. ""Empire of the Sun' is really a fantastic tale that's sure to inspire, delight, shed some tears and uplift the soul of its viewers.Rating: **** out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Direction from Steven Spielberg is spot-on, as you would imagine. Sumptuous distance- and panning-shots.A 13-year old Christian Bale, in his second cinema-movie role, puts in a great performance.

Mind-bendingly stupid,"I read some of these comments and I'm totally floored. The acting was horrid and forced, mostly due to the director creating scenes and instructing his actors to respond in completely unrealistic ways, such as when the parents of the ""lost"" children simply stand around staring at the assembled children until, after an eternity, one parent recognizes their kid. Um, yeah, right. Nobody would shout out a name, right? None of the kids recognize their own freaking parents. And this movie is full of moments like this.The Japanese come off almost like clownish figures, the Chinese as mere backdrops in their own country. The set pieces are ridiculous and none of this is even remotely close to actual history. I don't care if this is told from ""the boy's perspective."" That's not an excuse for lazy, unfocused, and completely unrealistic work. OK, so it's not supposed to be realism. It's ""surrealism."" Well, it fails on that level too as it doesn't produce a sense of wonder or fascination, but rather a sense of endless irritation and boredom as scenes go on and on, or simply cut to another unrelated scene. If Spielberg was shooting for some kind of ""war as seen from a kid's point of view"" he really blew it, unless we're to believe children are on a permanent happy acid trip.Scored like a soaring Disney kid's flick and sanitized to the point of being an insult, this movie is worthless. Another example of Spielberg's total inability to cover serious subjects with anything other than the mentality of a semi-autistic child. Jim's transformations are completely phony, based on nothing more than the script. Annoying English boy turns into bad-acting English boy.Don't let the high ratings fool you.

"This movie was a visual, character driven movie of superior quality,","This movie was a visual, character driven movie of superior quality, even for Steven Speilberg. Some say that Speilberg has too much the eye of a child, but I tend to disagree. Too many filmmakers today are producing slick, throw away action flicks that at first seem promising but eventually fall into predictable, fluff and special effects laden, thinly plotted, dialogue-poor, characterless movies that are gone before the popcorn. Yes, this film has a lot of great Special Effects (So did Schindler's List.) Moreover, a lot of great action to keep the story pace from dragging. The idea of a movie is for the actors and directors to show their stuff (Hopefully around some good writing.) This movie did it for me. I have to agree with all those who praised Christian Bale for his performance in this movie. He was brilliant. In addition, I got to see Ben Stiller in an unusual role for him. I thought that John Malcovitch acted perfectly for this film and yes he was a Han Solo/Indiana Jones character, but with even less depth. His role was pivotal only in so far as it affected the boy. We were not as concerned with his character in so much as his shadow was cast on Jim through out the movie. The war was bigger than this little  boy was and it was exquisitely done.

Interesting but not Extremely Entertaining,"Before Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg directed another World War Il film called Empire of the Sun. It's quite different from the two previously mentioned movies. It's a lot less dark, and there's a lot less action. It's a good enough movie, but as for the entertainment factor..well, let's just say it's a long movie with slow storytelling.Storytelling is the key word here. There's no real build up, no thrilling climax, no big dramatic ending, so it felt very much like I was simply being told a story about a season of someone's life. In this case, that someone is a spoiled English boy played by a young Christian Bale.If I hadn't known that Christian Bale was the lead going in, I would have figured it out real quick. It was eerie to me how much his acting as a young child is so similar to his acting as an adult. He poured so much energy and enthusiasm into this role. I would say he steals the show, but in reality, he's supposed to be the show. Just about every other character hangs out in his shadow. It couldn't have been more important to nail this casting and ensure we got a compelling character. This character starts off bratty and annoying, but thankfully, the circumstances that befall him do quite a transforming work on him.There is an unexpected lightheartedness to this movie. There's dark stuff happening, but things are kept pretty upbeat given the circumstances. I was hoping for a big emotional punch, but the movie chose to slap me on the wrist instead. The lack of an impact and the slowness of the story made this fall right under a 7/0 for me, meaning it's not one I'd likely recommend to friends when there's so many better WW2 movies out there.",7.0,Anonymous,History

As he closes his eyes at the end of the film in one of the most moving scenes I can remember, you see what a simply fantastic job Spielberg has done to bring J.

Baleman begins (cinematheque),"I really like this movie for the same reasons that most people despise it: First, they say that Spielberg's choice to present wartime like a park game is inappropriate. Well, as the story is about a teen, I think that this angle is particularly accurate. When we were kids, we don't see the same world as adults and sometimes they can be joyful in the darkest hours. Next, they say that Williams score is too much. For me, this is one of his best score and he excels as much with the songs than with the music. How many score do you whistle leaving the theater? In conclusion, ""Empire"" is one of my favorite because with all this and more: emotion is everywhere and that's precisely what those critics ignore: at the end, the only question is how we feel? Here, i feel excellent, having touched the core of humanity as Jim touched the planes. And i can add more if you want: Bale is an extraordinary beginner and he really carries the picture all by himself. Then, we discover the world and the history of the Far East and it's cool to have a good epic nowadays. Again ? Well, Spielberg was particularly fit and inventive here because he really knew how to put together in the same frame, war, innocence, upper classes and people. If a lot of great directors have a favorite genre (Burton, Lynch), Spielberg is the only great with all: romance, SF, comedy, action.... Maybe people dislike the movie because they focus too much on Malkovich's character, which is indeed a very dark soul, completely driven by his self-seeking survival. He really haunts the movie and it's the black hole of this empire of the sun...Pairing: ""Schindler's list"": another hopeful message from a war camp.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent And Believable,"Young Christian Bale offered a powerful performance in this drama about a young boy separated from his family after the Japanese occupation of Shanghai and sent to an internment camp, where he has to find a way to survive.Bale's portrayal of Jamie (or Jim) was the highlight of this movie. I thought he captured the boy's confusion perfectly. Raised in Shanghai, as a child of privilege living in an opulent British enclave, Jamie has lost touch with his British roots (as he notes at one point in the movie, he's never even been to Britain.) He admires the Japanese and, although he never actually says this, one gets the impression that he'd really like the Japanese to win the war. At the same time, he becomes increasingly aware of the brutal treatment those interned with him are receiving at the the hands of their Japanese captors.In the camp, Jamie is befriended by Basie (John Malkovich), an American prisoner with whom he establishes a somewhat complicated relationship. Basie comes to treat him largely as an adult; while Jamie depends on him more and more. Their friendship has its ups and downs, and Malkovich also put on a good performance in the role.Although the story is fictional, it struck me as a believable portrayal of something that could have happened. I had a little bit of trouble with the timeline. The first half of the movie is set obviously in late 1941, just before and after the Japanese attack, and then there is a sudden shift to 1945 in the last half of the movie. The intervening years are left out. One wonders about what life in the internment camp had been like in those intervening years. I found that omission of 3 plus years a bit jolting, although doing much with it would have made a long movie even longer. Essentially, as I think back to the story, three scenes remain with me: (1) when Jamie, looking for his toy plane, stumbles across the Japanese soldiers; (2) when Jamie is separated from his mother (played by Emily Richard); and (3) the last scene of the movie, which I won't describe because I don't want to spoil it.Overall, I thought this movie was excellent. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Moving and memorable book movie adaptation about a British schoolboy's loss of innocence in a time of war,"This was a poignant film about the loss of innocence, capturing the full depth of the semi-autobiographical book by J.G. Ballard on which it is based. With the Japanese invading 1940s Shanghai, British schoolboy Jim Graham is separated from his parents and undergoes a remarkable journey of survival. After losing his parents in the rush of the crowd, he follows his mother's instructions to go home, only to find the house seized by the Japanese. Nevertheless, he remains there for several weeks, surviving on canned food and hoping that his mother will return. Desperate for an adult figure, he tries to surrender to the Japanese in a funny and heart-breaking scene and is eventually taken in by an American fugitive, Basie. While Basie eventually fills that role, his motives are from pure; Basie's influence and the harsh circumstances of the internment camp see Jim gradually wisen up to the ways of the world. Despite this, Jim retains a certain warmth and goodness of heart that endear the viewer to him. We also witness Jim's conflict of loyalties - he recognises how cruel the Japanese are, yet admires them for the bravery and can't quite identify with England.Jim experienced so many complex emotions throughout and Spielberg has done an amazing job of conveying them via the cinematography and dialogue. The soundtrack was perfection. Altogether, the film is highly commendable for distilling the book's essence and packing a powerful emotional punch. While I still think that people should read the book simply because it's a masterpiece, the movie is fantastic in capturing the heart and soul of the story.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Great Film,"Empire of the Sun is just as wonderful of an example of the ethereal, soul-grabbing magic Spielberg creates as any. It's an aggressively arresting epic that develops heavily and suddenly takes a turn with a harsh whirlwind of a dramatic tempest.In his very first role at the age of twelve, Christian Bale racks the audience like a barrage of machine gun bullets, delivering sensationally in maybe the most demanding, evolving, and extensive role for a child I've ever seen in a movie. John Malkovich, as he always has, steals every scene he is in, playing the coldest but most generally charming supporting character. Among other highlights of the cast are early performances from Miranda Richardson, playing a very sorrowful Englishwoman who augments as much as she can before the chance of diminishment heightens, Nigel Havers, playing a doctor who amidst all the pressure that keeps him on edge manages to keep Bale's rampagingly passionate youngster down to earth, Joe Pantoliano, even this early in his career playing life's punching bag in the form of a nagging sidekick, and Ben Stiller, the film's biggest surprise, in a bit part among many other no-names in the group of American boys at Malkovich's feet.Empire of the Sun tells a dynamic, lavish, and heartfelt story of a young English boy, adventurous and wide-eyed as can be, obsessively fascinated by airplanes, belonging to a rich family in Shanghai during WWII who is hit like a ton of bricks by the Japanese occupation. The most impressive thing about the film is its portrayal of this young boy's alien perspective of all that suddenly happens and his furiously fast learning of his situation, adapting to all that devastates his life.Those who feel that slight twinge of bias against Steven Spielberg for his mind-blowing and never-ending box office success, you are really missing out on the brilliant work of one of those filmmakers who is truly a master at what a movie, like a novel, is supposed to do, which is suck you into every sensory element of the world of its characters.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Stunning masterpiece.,"First of I would like to comment the rating of the movie which is a 7.5 and say that there are movies over 8.5 that's created less than this one, so don't let it fool you.Second I would like to give credits for Christian Bales performance. He was only 12 years old, but he acted like it's all he does. Never in my life iv'e seen a betterperformance by a juvenile actor. Considering that I think he should won an Oscar.

I don't know what it was about the movie that intrigued me so much at that age, but it was my favorite movie to watch and still is to this very day. Empire of the Sun is probably Spielberg's best film, without a doubt. The cinematography in this film is astounding. Everything is real, no CGI to throw the reality off in the mind which makes this movie so moving. I don't know how Spielberg filmed half of this movie, all I can say is ""a LOT of time!"".Empire of the Sun is a very emotional film, and all aspects of being a prisoner of war are very detailed. John Malkovich and Joe Pantoliano had outstanding performances in this film, not to mention Christian Bale's performance was just uncanny for his age.

Another Wonderful Spielberg Creation,"it was one of those movies i never expected to watch. it was late, i was bored, and i happened to stumble upon a channel i barely ever watch. and while i sat watching events unfold in front of me, i slowly forgot about my usual program of interest. there is something about this film that truly captivates you and leaves your eyes glued to it every second. Christian bale displays his talents wonderfully in this movie, and the most striking thing to me was his ability to give such a realistic, yet youthful performance. his subtle acts of defiance against authority, his brave expeditions that left older men in awe, the fact that a little boy could irritate a general so much. friendships were forged, even with the enemy and it was by far one of the most astounding movies i've ever seen. it's long, it's good, and if you haven't seen it - do so.",,Anonymous,History

Weird and Magic movie,"Never wrote a comment about a movie, this is the first time. About this movie ? I know that people does love or hate this movie...well I'm with the first group. Perhaps because I read the book from J.Ballard and found it a very interesting and compelling reading. The movie from Spielberg is a very original interpretation of the book. It's impossible to find a definition for this movie, it's not a common war movie or a common dramatic movie. As happens in the book, also in the movie everything is saw from the point of view of a boy that has a lot of imagination (...in fact he will become a writer). The reality often is merged with hallucinations ( the atom bomb ). Jim is a weird boy with a strong will to survive, attracted by the loneliness and sadness of Japanese pilots which he feels near to his own condition. I saw all the movie from Spielberg and I don't like him ( I'm the kind of man that like things like I.Bergman, Ozu etc. ) But this movie is different, it's the only movie from Spielberg that I really like.

Wildly overblown,"Visually, an utterly stunning film. Spielberg mounts a fantastic cinematographic display, every shot beautifully composed. There's a sweeping score too, huge crowd scenes, dream sequences, the works.And there's a fine story of a boy's loss of innocence, of how apampered rich kid learns to survive, becoming a wheeler-dealer who knows how many cigarettes will buy a potato or cabbage. Though not quite as brutal as military POW camps, surviving the Japanese civilian  prison camps required courage and resourcefulness, and young Jim acquires and uses these qualities in abundance.The whole trouble with this movie is that the story and the presentation simply don't match up. We have a little story of a young boy's determined little struggle against adversity projected on to the broadest of canvases. We don't need every scene to be a spectacular, to have a huge score to take every hint of emotion to absurd heights, to be invested with emblematic significance. Pairs of shoes,  battered suitcases, bicycles - these objects are far too mundane to be the leitmotivs of Wagnerian opera, which is the epic scale on which Spielberg has built his edifice.Spielberg can make good little films about boys - see ET, for example - but placing his little story in such a grand setting obscures the tale and devalues the majesty of the filming.This is much less than the sum of its parts, and it could well irritate you beyond belief. During the last third of the movie, Ifound myself snorting or expostulating at each yet more overblown set-piece purporting to be deeply significant unfolded.The Empire falls resoundingly between two stools (one made of plain wood and the other richly decorated and upholstered in regal style).",7.0,Anonymous,History
The best Spielberg movie of all time unfortunately glides under the radar screen  of most viewers.,"This is truly Spielberg's best movie. In my opinion, it is one of the best movies of all times. It is a movie so laced with symbolism and incredible imagery that it takes multiple viewings, sometimes in slow motion replay, to catch the significance of it all. The title, ""Empire of the Sun"" is not about Japan, but about the empire of the SON. This is a story about an amazing young boy, very gifted and a consummate survivor. The movie is about HIS empire that he builds in the midst of incredible adversity. The painting of a couple putting their child to bed and giving ""security"" is very effectively laced throughout the film. The very capable son seeks this security in earnest. Another special moment is when Jamie sees the incredible light of ""Mrs Victor"" going into heaven. The symbolic light was from the atomic bomb over Hiroshima, bringing to the ""victors"" what they sought. This movie is a true classic, unfortunately underrated by so many who have not taken the time to see the symbolism it contains.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Empire of the Sun glaringly shines insight into the impoverished wealthy amidst war-torn China.,"Spielberg is one of a handful of directors that everyone acknowledges. Whether your interest lies with films or elsewhere, he is known to all for his eclectic filmography that tackles nearly every single genre available. The beauty of his directorial talents, is that he can manipulate any subject matter and transform its contents into an accessible piece of entertainment. From hard-hitting crime capers ('The Sugarland Express') to the depiction of African-Americans succumbing to racial/sexist abuse ('The Color Purple'). He has the ornate ability to disassemble history and shape the remnants into his Hollywood mould. But at what cost?Does Spielberg's contagious requirement for accessibility downplay the severity of its subject matter? Well, Empire of the Sun may just be the most perfect example to answer the aforementioned question. It illustrates my eternal adoration for the man as an auteur, as well as his damned tendencies that bring down his historical endeavours. A young British boy living with his wealthy family in war-torn Shanghai, becomes separated from his parents where he is soon retained as a prisoner of war in an internment camp.An epic adaptation of Ballard's semi-autobiographical novel, that heavily relied on a fictitious narrative to convey his own vivid memories of World War Two. A story of three vital themes that power both the characters and the central narrative. Opulence, faith and humanity. Spielberg commences the first act in a worrying light of unnecessary affluence, following a white family with an abundance of possessional wealth traversing the segregated streets of Shanghai embattled by poverty. The bitter aftertaste of supremacy as ""peasants"" desperately fight for survival. Whilst it may harken to real events, they make for unlikeable characters due to their careless perception in the environment they are enshrouded in. The father and mother are non-characters, merely acting as fuel for Jim's coming-of-age journey, and Spielberg paid far less attention to the surrounding chaos which consequently diminished the severity of the war's impact. It can be argued that the entire story, including the first act, is told through Jim's perspective. But the naive ignorance to represent the lives that were truly affected was extremely profound.Then Jim, in the crowded streets of Shanghai, becomes separated from his parents. Mugged, abandoned and lost. His opulent lifestyle relinquished from his selflessness. Gradually, Spielberg constructs an epic that conveys the loss of innocence. This once fragile young boy, unbeknown to the horrors of the world, now utilising his intuition to survive the brutality of war independently. Spielberg definitely downplayed the brutalism of conflict, and instead opted for an endearing focus on Jim's abrupt development from a timid boy to unsung hero. Unsurprisingly, it worked. Spielberg's screenplay presents Jim with a plethora of challenges that tests the will of humanity in its entirety. From attempting to escape the internment camp to resuscitating the recently deceased. Jim encompasses every notion of humanity during this heightened time, naturally making him relatable. His actions slowly further his development into adulthood in such a short space of time, with much gratification aimed at Spielberg's masterful attention to characterisation.Initially proclaimed as an atheist, Jim experiences metaphysical moments believed to be acts of faith, likening him to a deity of some kind. ""Giving life"" for a brief moment to the recently passed, which was an ounce of blood pumped to the brain. Witnessing a soul be released into heaven, however counteracted by the infamous Nagasaki atomic bomb. These ""acts"" grant Jim the power of self-belief, fully realising his potential as the ""hero"" of optimism.There's nothing more optimistic and endearing though than watching a juvenile Christian Bale steal the entire film. Malkovich and Havers ground the enthusiasm of Bale's performance, yet his commanding presence at such a young age cements him as a talent to behold. Tender moments were handled with delicacy, whilst the louder moments fused with his boisterous personality. Quite simply, one of the best young performances I've seen. Williams' signature score, ever accompanying Spielberg's work, elevated the grandeur of the spectacular production design yet somewhat exhumed family-friendly vibes commonly found in his previous work. Admittedly that's a personal conflict of my own, but again did diminish the more powerful scenes. Jim's fascination with aircraft wasn't fully realised and felt like an afterthought to coincide with the Japanese ""friend"" in the final act, although not a substantial detriment to the overall story.In the blazing heat of war camps, Empire of the Sun shines as an epic that showcases the very reason for my Spielberg idolisation and his cursed ability to lessen the severity of history. Regardless, you'll laugh, gasp and cry during this coming-of-age tale, and that's the true beauty of this auteur's timeless work.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Doesn't Quite Make It,"Realizing that they would be at a disadvantage in manpower and advanced weaponry in any large war, the Japanese in the early 20th century adopted military terrorism as a weapon. Japanese serviceman were themselves brutalized and taught to be brutal. When the Chinese city of Nanking proved difficult to conquer, the Japanese army ran amok killing, raping, and looting. Perhaps 250,000 civilians were killed. When the same was happening with Shanghai, the Chinese nationalists ceased to defend their cities and retreated to the interior, still fighting and supported by Anglo-American equipment. This made a Japanese victory in China even more difficult to accomplish.This is the environment within which Empire of the Sun plays out its story. But its few Chinese characters are dehumanized; none are killed. And the Japanese are presented as heroic warriors, albeit perhaps a tad short tempered. It's one thing to not be true to history but quite another to ignore the overriding tragic milieu within which this story plays out.What is left is a boy's adventure in a prison camp with a war raging around it. It is episodic; It seems to be set up to get one ""high art"" scene in and then move on to another high art scene, not necessarily a continuation of where the story has gone previously. Then a few more ""high art"" sequences are presented after the story has played itself out.This was written by Tom Stoppard, who, as a child, was dislocated again and again in World War II.

More Than Meets the Lazy Eye,"The problem with Empire of the Sun is that it *was - is - will always be* completely misunderstood.Written by Pulitzer Prize winner Tom Stoppard and based on J.G. Ballard's award-winning semi-autobipographical account of his adolescence in a Japanese internment camp, the entire film is a treatise on the human gifts for self-delusion and denial in the face of an overwhelming reality. In the film, character after character fights to avoid their grim circumstances by retreating into their inner world - they feverishly hang on to their previous lives and dreams, and only the characters who shuck off that treasured skin survive the new world created in the wake of World War II.One of the chief misunderstandings of Empire of the Sun is the visual strategy Spielberg employs throughout the film in service to his theme. Time and again, his camera shows us scenes and shots that aren't actually happening in the 'real' world - Situations are seen as they are perceived or as they have been re-imagined in the memory of the film's twelve-year -old protagonist, Jim Graham (an astonishing Christian Bale). Jim is a pampered child of privelege given to flights of fantasy as the film opens - by its end, he will have all of those predilictions towards childhood dreams beaten out of him. By the end credit scrawl, he is the ultimate pragmatist, his collection of childhood memorabilia literally floating alongside the dead in the Shanghai Harbor.As is unusual for a Spielberg film, the film's narrative events all support the central idea, instead of the ideas supporting a headlong narrative. Empire of the Sun is unique in the Spielberg canon in that its plot is secondary to the main dramatic action. Those expecting the normal Spielberg gift of A-Z storytelling were confused by a film that was less interested in story than it was on symbolism, allusions, ideas - many of these presented in throaways and visual gimmicks that went completely unnoticed.Here is an example of the enormous texture of the film -- just one of the little unnoticed treasures in the movie that Spielberg pulls out like so much pocket lint -- early in the film, Jim's parents put him to bed, and Spielberg's editor Michael Kahn does a quick dissolve of the same image on top of itself. At first, it seems like a bizarre technical goof - only later when Jim makes the revelation that he has idealized his parents so much that he can't remember what they actually look like -- only then does the image zing home: A painting by Norman Rockwell from Life magazine hangs next to Jim's makeshift prison bed - This painting is the exact same image of parent and child from the beginning of the film.All of this serves to subtly illustrate that the line between reality and remembered reality has been blurred by the War and the characters' need to escape.Unfortuantely for Spielberg, his brilliant technique was taken at face value - his startegy was so complex, so smart, that it sailed completely over the heads of people not used to doing analytical thinking when watching a film with the moniker ""Spielberg"" attatched. This wasn't ""E.T."", and it left people baffled. Eevn some scenes that clearly are Jim's fantasies were taken as ""real"" -- such as a pilot waving a salute to Jim, or a refrigerator spilling open, revealing a treasure of glitter and toys. But critics completely missed the boat, and chided Spielberg for his ""fakery "".The problem with works like ""Empire of the Sun"" is the tendency to reduce the film's moments into a sort of intellectual parlor game. The film's many many asides certainly don't discourage this (one quick throaway shows the British prisoners performing a reading from Shakespeare's ""Midsummer Night 's Dream""), but when a film is somewhat dependent on the symbolic asides to relate its message, and the audience misses the boat, you have to rely only on your story to satisfy them. Time and again, this is what critics complained about - the films less-than-urgent third act.For over a decade now, ""Empire of the Sun"" has languished in some sort of filmic netherworld, referenced only as some sort of prep course for Spielberg to get up for ""Schindler's List"", ""Amistad"", and ""Saving Private Ryan"". It is my opinion that the failure of this film - one labored and planned over so meticulously - was a giant blow to Spielberg. The incredible success of the uninspired ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" must have been equally disheartening.In all, for those of you who have been quick to write off ""Empire of the Sun "" as Floppus Spielbergus, I say to take a second look, except this time, take the moments to ask yourself what the film is really about, and then notice all the work being done by Spielberg and Stoppard to sell you on that idea. It is a rapturous, wondrous piece of filmmaking -- one so beautiful there are moments that actually hurt to watch.If you don't expect ""Raiders of the Lost Prison Camp"", I think you'll find much to reward you.",,Anonymous,History

Steven Spielberg's Best movie ever!,"GOD playing tennis: that's what Jim Graham (Christian Bale), a privileged British schoolboy living in high colonial style in the pre-Pearl Harbor Shanghai of 1941, sees in one of his dreams. God taking a photograph: Jim thinks he sees that four years and seemingly several lifetimes later, as a starving, exhausted prisoner witnessing the brilliant light of the atomic bomb.What transpires in between, the sweeping story of Jim's wartime exploits after he is separated from his family, is set forth so spectacularly in Steven Spielberg's ''Empire of the Sun'' that the film seems to speak a language all its own. In fact it does, for it's clear Mr. Spielberg works in a purely cinematic idiom that is quite singular. Art and artifice play equal parts in the telling of this tale. And the latter, even though intrusive at times, is part and parcel of the film's overriding style.Yes, when Jim crawls through swampy waters he emerges covered with movie mud, the makeup man's kind; when he hits his head, he bleeds movie blood. It's hard not to be distracted by such things. But it's also hard to be deterred by them, since that same movie-conscious spirit in Mr. Spielberg gives ''Empire of the Sun'' a visual splendor, a heroic adventurousness and an immense scope that make it unforgettable.There are sections of ''Empire of the Sun'' that are so visually expressive they barely require dialogue (although Tom Stoppard's screenplay, which streamlines J. G. Ballard's autobiographical novel, is often crisp and clever). Its first half hour, for example, could exist as a silent film -an extraordinarily sharp evocation of Shanghai's last prewar days, richly detailed and colored by an exquisite foreboding. Jim is first seen singing in a church choir (the Welsh hymn ''Suo Gan'' will echo again hauntingly later in the story), then gliding through crowded streets in his family's chauffeur- driven Packard. At home, he asks his parents off-handed questions about the coming war. When the three of them, elaborately costumed, heedlessly leave home for a party on the other side of the city, it's clear that their days there are numbered just from the way the Chinese servants wave goodbye.That first glimpse of the choirboys will prompt audiences to wonder which of these well-groomed, proper little singers is to be the film's leading man. Mr. Bale, who emerges from the choir by singing a solo, at first seems just a handsome and malleable young performer, another charming child star. But the epic street scene that details the Japanese invasion of the city and separates Jim from his parents reveals this boy to be something more. As Mr. Bale, standing atop a car amid thousands of extras and clasping his hands to his head, registers the fact that Jim is suddenly alone, he conveys the schoolboy's real terror and takes the film to a different dramatic plane. This fine young actor, who appears in virtually every frame of the film and ages convincingly from about 9 to 13 during the course of the story, is eminently able to handle an ambitious and demanding role.But other episodes are less sharply defined. When Jim, who has proudly won his right to live in the American barracks, returns to the British camp in which he formerly lived, it takes a moment to remember why he's back - not because the motive is unclear, but because his departure from the one place and return to the other are separated by intervening scenes.Still, there are many glorious moments here, among them Jim's near- religious experiences with the fighter planes he sees as halfway divine (in one nighttime scene, the sparks literally fly). And there is a full panoply of supporting characters, including Miranda Richardson, who grows more beautiful as her spirits fade, in the role of a married English woman who both mothers Jim and arouses his early amorous stirrings. It is the mothering that seems to matter most, for Jim's small satchel of memorabilia includes a magazine photograph of a happy family, a picture he takes with him everywhere. For a surrogate father, he finds the trickier figure of Basie (John Malkovich), a Yank wheeler-dealer with a sly Dickensian wit. Basie, who by turns befriends Jim and disappoints him, remains an elusive character, but Mr. Malkovich brings a lot of fire to the role. ''American, are you?'' one of his British fellow prisoners asks this consummate operator. ''Definitely,'' Mr. Malkovich says.''Gone With the Wind'' is playing at the biggest movie theater in Shanghai when the Japanese are seen invading that city, and ''Gone With the Wind'' is a useful comparison, at least in terms of subject and style. The makers of that film didn't really burn Atlanta; that wasn't their method. They, too, as Mr. Spielberg does, let the score sometimes trumpet the characters' emotions unnecessarily, and they might well have staged something as crazy as the ''Empire of the Sun'' scene in which the prisoners find an outdoor stadium filled with confiscated art and antiques and automobiles, loot that's apparently been outdoors for a while but doesn't look weatherbeaten in the slightest. Does it matter? Not in the face of this film's grand ambitions and its moments of overwhelming power. Not in the light of its soaring spirits, its larger authenticity, and the great and small triumphs that it steadily delivers.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Bale as the main character, Jamie Graham, a boy, is virtually in every scene of the movie and fills them with talent and brilliance (it is worth noting that Bale is still a good and well-known actor). As for Malkovich, he has always been a firm choice, I can not remember a movie where I have not liked him.

The direction which was made by Steven Spielberg was for one more time simply amazing and he succeeded on making us understand much more for war and his main characters and also to relate to them. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I have to admit that I was amazed by the interpretation of Christian Bale who played as Jim and he was simply outstanding. Another interpretation that have to be mentioned was John Malkovich's who played as Basie and he was also very good.

Steven Spielberg grows up,"From the first glimpse of open caskets floating down the Yangtze River to the final image of the young hero's childhood baggage drifting away on the tide, it's clear Steven Spielberg is trying to challenge both himself and his audience, with a daring (for this director) adaptation of J.G. Ballard's autobiographical novel. For the most part he succeeds admirably, harnessing his state-of-the-art talents to an allegorical wartime fantasy (written from firsthand experience) about a young British boy in Shanghai, separated from his parents after the Japanese invasion and thrust into the alleys and gutters of an alien world, ending the war in a civilian internment camp. But this is no typical coming-of-age drama; in wartime the end of innocence often brings madness, not maturity, and Spielberg doesn't compromise the material with the expected blockbuster flourishes (as he did in 'The Color Purple'). Despite the director's distracting emphasis on flashy visual exposition, his film nevertheless makes demands on its audience that they may not be prepared to meet: fans of 'Indiana Jones' and 'ET' really can't be expected to shoulder the burden of so much arcane symbolism and haunting, dreamlike imagery. If for nothing else Spielberg deserves credit for taking a risk on such an uncommercial property.",8.0,Anonymous,History
There's some good and some bad about this movie...,"Humm... this is a difficult to rate one. I'm not sure how should I rate it. It's a movie that creates mixed feelings on me. Although this is not bad for a war movie, I feel it could have been way better. I feel that the movie had potential to be solid, but ended up being only okay. But I don't want anybody to think I'm writing in Chinese, so let me explain my point.The movie has an expressive story, a great soundtrack (for example, that beautiful ""Suo Gan"" theme), an amazing performance by a young Christian Bale, some of the most incredible scenes with planes ever put in a film (at least on this point it is perfect) and the movie is quite good during the first hour.However, from the second half on, the movie begins to lose its initial greatness: it focus too much on the killing fields and the story (even the movie itself) loses its interest. There are still some wonderful scenes with planes in this second half of the movie and fabulous special effects (a visually stunning experience), but just that isn't enough to save it.Christian Bale, like I said, is outstanding in this film. He portrays in perfection Jamie Graham, a very lively and talkative young English boy fascinated by planes (to the point of wishing to pilot one and even calling them ¬´P-51, the Cadillac of the sky¬ª) and fan of the Japanese pilots's bravery.Jamie is a likable chap. However, Dainty, Frank and Basie are quite annoying. Plus, the fact that Ben Stiller is in the movie already seals the movie's fate a bit (even if his role is minor). Ben Stiller is one of the most ridiculous actors of all times.This isn't one of the most violent war movies, but still there are some brutal scenes, such as Jamie's Asian friend being unfairly killed.So, a reasonable movie and decent Spielberg film.

As a young man who lived in Japan, studied the language, the people, the culture, later returned to the Far East on business trips to Manchuria and Shanghai, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Osaka, I can only marvel at what Director Spielberg has achieved here with a young actor worthy of Best Performance from a Juvenile Actor 1987. The making of the movie with author J.G.Ballard is also very interesting, with wonderful rapport between Director and a 13 yr old actor Christian Bale. I am waiting for Spielberg to do The Fall of Singapore in 1942, the British guns pointing out to sea expecting a naval attack, whereas the 90,000 Japanese troops cycled down the Malay Peninsula to surround 130,000 British, Australian, Canadian and Indian troops. In the Malayan jungle the tires burst on the bicycles, the Japanese rode on with just the steel rims. This sound to the British indicated the Japanese were travelling with light tanks and the British withdrew. Yamashita wanted a simple yes or no, and Percival surrendered to a smaller force. There is so much more in the history of the Pacific War for Spielberg to cover and uncover. Anway, Empire of the Sun is a great movie, meticulous in its detail and Shanghai crowd scenes, the survival of a boy in a prison camp, sad, heartbreaking, and moving the viewer to tears From Malcolm in Toronto 25th July 2007",10.0,Anonymous,History
"It's good, but it's no masterpiece.","Spielberg is one of the best of today's Hollywood directors and especially his historically inspired movies like ""Schindler's List"", ""Amistad"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", I appreciated a lot. Knowing that this movie too was from his hand and that it told a story situated in China during the Japanese occupation of the country in WWII, really made me look forward to it, hoping for a movie that would be at least as good as the three others that I mentioned above...At the start of WWII, when the Japanese start to occupy China, there are a lot of British citizens living in Shangai. A lot of them flee as the Japanese army comes closer, but the aristocratic family of the young James Graham stays, not easily willing to give up the privileged life that they are leading. But when on December 8, 1941, the Japanese take over the city, it's too late for them to get out. James gets separated from his family and finds himself living on the street and fighting for food, until he is eventually captured and taken to a confinement camp for British civilians, next to a captured Chinese airfield. Here he develops an admiration for the American captured pilots that are kept prisoner with the British civilians, as well as for the Japanese fighter pilots who take off from the airfield. And while he tries to survive among all the sick and hungry people, he keeps believing that one day he will see his parents again...Overall I liked this movie, but I must say that the second part was definitely the best. As soon as he is in that POW camp and gradually calms down, I could feel sorry for James, but as long as he was that spoiled and annoying little kid who liked to boss the staff around, who didn't seem to care for any rules or regulations,... I can't say that he did something to me. And that's something that I can't say about the Japanese boy who was always hanging around on the airstrip and who I liked from the beginning. When he was about to finally realize his dream of flying a real airplane, although that would mean certain death because he was about to embark on a Kamikaze mission, I was happy for him. And it's weird, but when he couldn't take off, I truly felt sorry for him, knowing what this meant to him. So in the end I would say that for me personally it was a lot easier to empathize with him than with that spoiled British kid.The acting in this movie is good. Takatoro Kataoka was excellent as the young Japanese boy and John Malkovich was my favorite as Basie, but the others were OK as well. I'm not going to say that the performance of most of them was exceptional, but it was good and their acting certainly supported the interesting story. The fact that the story was written from the perspective of the young James isn't new though. Already in 1979, there was a war movie that used this concept. ""Die blechtrommel"" from Volker Schl√∂ndorff already showed the rise of the Nazi's in Gdansk, Poland (back then Danzig).Overall this certainly isn't a bad movie, but it just wasn't as great as what I'm used to see from Spielberg when it comes to this kind of movies. When you've seen for instance ""Schindler's List"", then you know that he is capable of a lot more than what he has shown with this movie. I just couldn't get completely and emotionally involved in it, like I could with ""Schinldler's List"" and that's why I will give this movie a 7/10, which certainly isn't bad, but just not as much as what I would give to the other one.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A lot of lost potential,"I just saw this movie last night. It really ended up being quite disappointing despite a very good beginning. The scenes near the start of the film really do a good job of transmitting the ominous feeling of looming war. When the war broke out, I was feeling the kid's fear and confusion. I was thinking it was going to be a good war journey film, like the Pianist. Unlike the Pianist, this story just seemed to spread itself to thin. Throughout the movie the kid gives all sorts of philosophical ponderings, at one point he declares, ""I have become an athiest."" Statements such as these seem like they should have meaning, but I couldn't find it. It was like much of the dialog and actions of the characters was just put out there with no insight to what caused them to speak and act in such a way. It seemed as though this got worse through the film. By the the time the end came, it seemed as though each scene was meaningless and unconnected to the next. If the character's motivations and psychology were made more apparent through the dialog, this could have been an excellent movie. The film was technically good, but the lack of insight into the characters leaves only a meaningless bore.",,Anonymous,History
Good direction from Spielburg and wonderful writing from Stoppard,"Empire of the Sun I watched this again for the second time at the weekend a wonderful enriching film. Christain Bale's Jim is distinctly unlikeable a spoilt brat who when separated from his parent's and placed in an internment camp becomes a class one survivor and all of his hither-to hidden qualities emerge and flourish. The two most memorable scenes for me are when he looks at Basie (Malkovich) sat in the puddle of water after his Japanese friend has been murdered. In that scene Jim sees Basie for what he truly is enabling Jim to move on and seek his own rescue. The second very moving scene is when Jim's parents turn up to claim Jim amidst all the other lost children being reunited. Jim stands alone neither looking to the right nor to the left unable to move or seemingly to show any emotion, his mother can be seen standing at a distance and she has recognised Jim and moves towards him, very emotive. The film I believe is one of Spielburg's best although the critics slammed it at the time of its release. It also benefits greatly from having Tom Stoppard as screen writer a very gifted and talented man.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Stunning Child's Eye View of the Clash of Colonial Empires,"I viewed ""Empire of the Sun"" on DVD as the first of Steven Spielberg's twentieth century historical films. In an interview on the DVD, he proclaims it to be a ""child's view of war,"" linking it to his ""E.T.""- oeuvre and predictively to his violent films to come, but it is unexpectedly about something else.It is a child's view of the tectonic clash of colonial empires, as the one upon which the sun never sets (the British) is dimmed by the rising sun (the Japanese), with them both trumped by the even brighter artificial sun of the U.S.'s super atom and economic power. For the boy, the continuing visual symbols for nature and man are the sun ¬ñlots of beautiful sun rises, broiling noons and sunsets-- and airplanes¬ótoys, bombers, ruins, kamikazes and rescuers.Through the autobiographical fiction of J.G. Ballard's original novel (and it is interesting to hear on the DVD interview what incidents are directly from his life), we start out seeing a Rudyard Kipling-like view of China. In this first act, we see arrogant, elitist Europeans hold court in an International Zone separated from the teaming poverty of Shanghai (and the filmmakers eerily recreate the original boundaries in the exact locale through the contemporary imperialism of Hollywood capitalism) that seems more pre-World War I than II. The added touch of having them dress up for a masquerade ball like Marie Antoinette, etc. is too heavy-handed.While the adaptation is by Tom Stoppard, the film then becomes all about young Christian Bale's performance, in a Robert Louis Stevenson-like boy's adventure tale, and stunning visual set pieces by cinematographer Allen Daviau.Bale is extraordinary. Watching him 20 years later, it is fascinating to see the mature actor within the child who even at this young age can produce boyish enthusiasm to desperation to exhaustion at the crack of ""Action."" Some of his best scenes are simply he alone, such as a resourceful kid who seems like a lone post-war survivor when he first misses the round-ups of Europeans.It is probably because we are looking through his innocent eyes that the Japanese are shown far less stereotypically than most such movies, particularly as he establishes a tentative connection with a youthful flier (though through his young confusion distinctions between Chinese and Japanese are unfairly not clear). His youthful resiliency is a remarkably fresh take on war time conditions as he adapts to any situation and learns enough to help others as well as himself, recalling John Boorman's ""Hope and Glory"" that was released the same year.A complete tonal shift occurs when he suddenly meets up with Americans who obviously recall characters from ""Catch 22"", marvelously played by a scheming John Malkovich and Joe Pantoliano as his side kick. It was very effective that we only hear them for many minutes before we see their faces, as we perceive them from the child's angle in hearing the clear distinctions from his upbringing in their styles, culture and language. (I only found out from the DVD interviews that their characters were stranded Merchant Marines as I didn't pick that up from the dialog.) The practicality of the Americans is coolly emphasized in one harrowing scene when they take bets on whether Bale's ""Jim"" will survive a chase.Miranda Richardson is notably not a stereotype. Just as Malkovich is an extremely reluctant paternal protector for Bale, Richardson is neither a snob nor maternal.The art direction and images then take over, overwhelming any theme about the absurdities of war or clashes or complements of cultures, from the increasingly desperate internment camp to an Allied attack to a useless march to another encampment filled with the luxurious detritus of the imperialists. Even as the exact time span is only indicated indirectly and the body count mounts, by the end we are seeing one striking tableau after another.British civilization seems too easily restored at the end after all we've seen.",8.0,Anonymous,History
The Brilliance of Empire of the Sun,"I saw this film a few weeks ago for a film studies project and I became completely captivated by the performance of young Christian Bale. As someone who has never experienced war but only seen depictions of it in movies, this film completely changed my view on World War Two. I admire how respectfully Spielberg depicts the Japanese soldiers in this film. Although there are scenes of great violence toward the camp members, the Japanese soldiers are portrayed as humans rather than the common villain like version often seen in movies. Jim's relationship with the Japanese pilot helped me empathize with both sides of the war. In reality the majority of soldiers in World War Two were victims to violence that they had little control over.
I recommend this movie for students who are looking for a different view on World War Two. Often Nazi Germany is the main focus of attention in the classroom setting. However, this film shows how far stretching the World War Two actually was and is effective in broadening one's mindset. Empire of the Sun will most likely make you question what it means to be loyal to your home country and ponder the far reaching effects of war.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"""Don't look back, Johnnie!""","After years of describing his childhood traumas allegorically as sci-fi J. G. Ballard finally felt able to confront the experience directly in this book.

A more thoughtful Spielberg film,"Steven Spielberg has shown himself to be one of the most versatile directors in the world, showing he can tackle almost any genre. But in the 1980s he was more famous for doing blockbusters like Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and the Indiana Jones series. In the mid 80s tried to change all that by making more serious, Oscar challenging films like The Colour Purple and of course, Empire of the Sun. This led to Spielberg gaining his well earn Oscar for Schindler's List.Starting in 1941, the Japanese army was getting closer to Shanghai. Many British ex-pats are starting to leave China for other British colonies. Jamie Graham (Christian Bale) is a wealth child living in a British area of the city. Jamie is a spoiled child, disrespecting his servants and lives a live of luxury. He is also smart child, who knows a lot about military aviation. When the Japanese troops finally takes Jamie and his family try and felt China. But Jamie is separated and forced to survive in the occupied city. Jamie quickly has to tie his destiny with Basie (John Malkovich), an American who ends up stuck in city, and shows himself to be resourceful, but morally, a little questionable. Jamie and Basie are captured by the Japanese, and forced to live in an internment camp. Jamie has to learn how to survive quickly.Empire of the Sun was based on the J. G. Ballard's semi-autobiographical novel, where he also had to live in Japanese occupied China. Here Spielberg shows his growing skill, working with a good script by Tom Stoppard. Spielberg tells a coming-of-age set during the horrors of war. Jamie really grows as a character, becoming a more caring character, shows how his innocence is clipped away. This is a more artist film by Spielberg with some of the scenes, aiming to put a lot of symbolism in the film. This ending up being very similar to the Soviet classic Come and See (highly recommended viewing). Spielberg shows the collapse of law and order in Shanghai, and tough conditions in a Japanese camp. But Spielberg also tries to show some balance in the film, with some Japanese characters in a more decent light, like a Japanese runaway technician. Jamie shows he has respect for the Japanese for their bravery, and from a distances the audiences slowly see the decline of the Japanese war-effort. Nowadays Spielberg uses CGI in his movies, like in Saving Private Ryan and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but that was not option in 1987. This actually makes the film better because it forced Spielberg to use more old fashioned techniques, and the action felt a lot more real, using real planes throughout. Whilst this is a good film for the most part, there were some moments that felt a little forced and unrealistic. Spielberg also shows that he has a weak for over-sentimentality, but those moments are few and far between. The character of Mrs. Victor (Miranda Richardson) also felt very underplayed, and her part was properly cut from what was originally intended.There is a good cast. Christian Bale at the age of 13 shows that even then he was a talented actor with a good future in actor. He offered an excellent performance and shows a real change in his character. John Malkovich is also a excellent actor and gives a strong performance as a mentor to Jamie. There also other good supporting performances throughout the film, such as Joe Pantoliano, Nigel Havers, Rupert Frazer and Emily Richard.There is a excellent score by John Williams, a long time collaberator with Spielberg, adding to the power of the film. The cinematography by Allen Daviau was also wondering done, showing many different territories of China. Daviau and Spielberg worked very well together to film some very difficult shots. Michael Kahn also offers a good editing job throughout the film.This was originally a project that the great David Lean wanted to direct, but Spielberg was pretty much following in his style. This is one of Spielberg's most surprising films and is well worth watching.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Empire of the Emperor,"Very few child actors can carry a movie. Giving it a quick gander I can think of McCauley Culkin in Home Alone and Haley Joel Osment in A.I. I'm sure there are others that I'm not thinking of right now but those come immediately to mind. Well, now I have to add Christian Bale. Of course, we know what a fine adult actor he turned out to be, but this movie was a sneak peak.Jim (Christian Bale) was a fascinating character. He was raised as a wealthy white British kid in China. He enjoyed the luxuries of that station up until Japan attacked during WWII. Shortly after the Japanese attacked Jim was separated from his parents and then his exciting, arduous, harrowing, maturing journey began. For a privileged child he was incredibly resourceful.The movie was light at times and heavy at other times. I don't it could avoid being heavy when it was about war. I can't pretend that I knew everything that was going on at all times (I honestly didn't know which soldiers were which at times). What little confusion there was could be shaken off by just focusing on Jim and his trials.I went from watching The Last Emperor to watching Empire of the Sun in a few short days. These were two excellent movies about the turbulent relationship between China and Japan with two different focal points.I think I've cracked the code.

Boring and uninteresting,"I can not believe all of the positive reviews I have read on this board. I saw this film was on TV a couple nights ago, and seeing that it starred John Malkovich and was directed by Steven Spielberg, I decided to give it a go. The film has an interesting premise.  From the start, it appears that this premise will grow throughout the picture.  It doesn't.  First of all, the child is the most annoying lead character I have ever seen.  It is impossible to feel for this kid throughout the rest of the movie.  The remainder of the film is spent building towards great emotional climaxes, but then the scene is uninteresting and really has no bearing upon anything. The depiction of internment camp life is something out of a post-apocolyptic movie.  The title is misleading, the film really has nothing to do with the Empire of the Sun (Japan).  Instead it is a aimlessly wandering film looking for a plot.  Some scenes simply don't make any sense.

Perplexed,"Am I the only person who did not really like this film?  Really, what was so great about it?  I did not care for Christian Bale's character so it made it really hard for me to care about the movie.  I also found the scene where he gets separated from his parents far too unrealistic, in fact preposterous. I have a young child and there is no way I would allow myself to be separated from her as easily as Jim's parents did, especially his father. I would have made some heads roll before I gave up and moved on without my child. The end was so unemotional it was ridiculous. I didn't even get the feeling that his parents really cared that much and they had a very difficult time recognizing their only son. You spend 2 hours watching this young boy grow up in an interment camp without the film ever attempting to show the struggle of his parents to find him. This was a glaring weakness that I just can not look past.John Malkovich's character reminded me of someone out of the Mad Max movies (go figure) and added nothing.  ""Empire"" never penetrated to the heart of the characters and didn't penetrate my heart either.  Where was the storytelling in this film?  None of the characters were developed fully to identify with their struggles. Jim did not have enough substance to be the entire focus of the film. Aside from a few good cinematographic moments, this movie was way too long and way to dull.  It is different than most movies you will ever see, but that doesn't make it good.  I rank this Steven Spielberg film along with Amistad as his worst.  Forgive me for giving an honest opinion.",,Anonymous,History

"Good attempt at adapting the story, but Spielberg's the wrong director","I think that had David Lean gone ahead and directed this movie it could have been an all time great film. Instead, Spielberg brought his personal angle to it, which means it falls from greatness.I think Spielberg wanted to bring an E.T. ""Child-centric"" theme to the film. Great, but the problem is that it means the other characters have to be neglected. Had Lean made this, he would have made the film an hour longer by including those other characters. I mean, Miranda Richardson gets second billing, yet she has about 4 lines of dialogue. I wanted to know more about her and the other supporting characters. Unfortunately they were sacrificed in the edit room, for time I presume.You feel that Empire of the Sun has an hour of deleted scenes that, if put back in, could make it one of the best films of that decade. I wish he'd had the confidence to give us more characterisation than just Jim (played by a remarkable Christian Bale). Still, it's a strong film with great technical proficiency.

This is the time to add this DVD to your library at the extraordinarily inexpensive price. It is a treasure and seeing 26 years after its initial release only enhances the impact this film made on the world not yet ready for such an epic.Tom Stoppard wrote the screenplay based on J. G. Ballard's autobiographical novel 'The Empire of the Sun' which tells the story of a boy, James Graham (Christian Bale, very young and very talented), whose privileged life is upturned by the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, December 8, 1941. Separated from his parents, he is eventually captured, and taken to Soo Chow confinement camp, next to a captured Chinese airfield. Amidst the sickness and food shortages in the camp, Jim attempts to reconstruct his former life, all the while bringing spirit and dignity to those around him. Somehow Bale manages to transform from the pampered British aristocracy in Shanghai through the changes brought about by the Japanese invasion of China and becomes a survivor and a little hero role model to many.Steven Spielberg directs this epic with a cast that includes John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson , Nigel Havers, Joe Pantoliano, Leslie Phillips, Masat√¥ Ibu, Ben Stiller among others.

Many film critics and movie goers dont care for many of the movies they make tody because of weak dialogue(and too much computer generated CRAP).

This movie is a good example of a good war film and fair enough cinematography but the dialogue is not only lengthy but confusing as well.

A powerful tribute to JG Ballard,"Being a reader of JG Ballard can only enhance your enjoyment of this film. I'd venture the opinion that this may well be the reason why this movie didn't hit the highs expected of it: Tom Stoppard took care not to over-narrate the film through dialogue or deliver a conventional narrative, choosing instead to craft something that acts as a deeply felt tribute to the peculiar genius of JG Ballard. I honestly can't see how anyone who doesn't read Ballard can truly get what this film is driving towards.In other words, it is a story about the formation of a deeply odd artist. A man who revelled in the concept of violent collision as the presiding principle of our universe: the collision of man and machine made possible through the motor engine; the collision of cultures; the collision of old and young, male and female, sane and insane, sadist and erotic; the collision of fiercely opposed world views; the collision of natural beauty with ugliness and sadism.Ballard was all this, and more. To get at this, there are worse places to start than 'The Empire of the Sun' itself. However, this is possibly his most conventional book. He left it until very late in his career to fictionalise the disturbing oddity of his childhood, and it reads a little as if the material he uncovered was almost too powerful for his established style as a novelist.If you read 'The Kindness of Women', its sequel insomuch as it fictionalises his adult existence, you get a great insight into how the war shaped Ballard's aesthetic. Sharper people than I have defined this, so I will simply say that it revolves around shocking juxtapositions, be that of image or emotion. He's a past master of delivering deeply emotional moments with a disturbingly clinical eye.Read Spielberg's opus through this lens and you will get its peculiar genius. I salute it as a terrific collision of image-maker and writer.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Uneven but entertaining,"I never saw this film on its original release, and have somehow missed it in the intervening years until now. I guess that there is nothing left to say about the eye-openingly mature performance that was given by Christian Bale (but it was!) so I'll (mostly) skip that. So, how was the film? Well, it strikes me that Japanese prisoner of war camps probably really were not that much fun. I appreciate that this was an all-ages film, and that demonstrating that the Japanese were just people too was part of the point, but I still feel that the overall terror and brutality of the situation was not as well conveyed as it should have been. The camp, as seen through Jim's eyes, seemed like a slightly grungy Butlins (well, not really, but you catch my drift). Bizarrely (for a self-professed movie fan) I've not seen Schindler's List either, and I am now even more curious to see how Spielberg handled that World War II story in comparison.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Meaningless, Annoying Characters","I don't know what it is that I missed about this ""epic"" film, but from the 15 minute mark on I was weighing whether to press stop or not. Christian Bale did an excellent job, no doubt: an excellent job at being extremely annoying. The first half of the movie he is running around speaking nonsense like a mongoloid, and then he switches to being like an old senile man.I admit, maybe there is some symbolism I should have picked up that I didn't, but the story had no form. I kept wishing that people would just stop helping this kid so that he'd get out of the story. John Malkovich did a good job (ie., I liked his character), but I had no idea who he was or why he did the things he did. It was the same with every other character: who were they? No one knows. Why were they going here? Saying this? Doing that? Total mystery. At one point, a japanese officer of some sort comes in to the dorm and beats a main character severely. But we have no idea why because they speak in japanese (I can't understand it, maybe you can). The only reason I can think of is that he stole japanese soap.Other things that confused me: Some of Jim's (Jaime's) lines seem totally strange: like he's a mental patient or something. It makes no sense. One second he's a helpless child and the next he's some philosopher? And the crawling through the weeds being pursued by a Jap soldier? Why?All in all, I just never understood what the movie was about. I appreciated the music (though boys choirs don't do it for me like they do for Mr. Jackson) and I liked the sunset scenes (with the pilots preparing to leave for kamakazi missions), but I never truly began to care about any of the characters, except maybe the japanese boy who is like Jim's counterpart on the other side - though I still don't know what his significance was.I'd advise to skip this movie, unless you feel like mocking the annoying kid with some friends (over some alcohol of some sort, you'll need it). But it's not even one of those ""I'm gonna see this just because this guy hated it so much."" Just annoying.",,Anonymous,History
Truly thought provoking!,"I cannot fathom why so many hated this in their reviews, however I feel that it maybe they just wasn't interested enough to understand or patience. It starts out as a upper class British family with a spoilt single child in this big home in Shanghai. The story is about this child who bullied his Chinese servants to do his deeds for them when all they wanted was to teach him good (don't know how this could be contrived to be racist or calling Chinese stupid as other reviewers suggest). All he wanted to do was to fly. Now some people got confused about his fascination with Japanese planes but they need to understand that he was born in China he never saw another airplane so he didn't know any better in fact he never been outside of China as i understand the story.There was a clear example of this when a former Chinese servant woman gave what that young boy truly deserved a good 'ol fashion smack.... many people said he was obnoxious and he was early but then he had to quickly change his ways just to survive. This movie shows that no one is winners in war and just how hard it would have been for a child to survive.The madness of war was creeping in and the emotions of each character was all there to be seen and it didn't treat the audience like idiots (perhaps it should have treated them simple as for some people just don't get his love for Zeros) If I could get my kids to watch it and really see it for what it is, perhaps they might learn something.I didn't see racism and I saw the good and the bad of all humans .... it was sad to see these fine young Japanese flyers go on their last flight for country.BTW what was it about so many asked???....

One of my favorite movies,"My favorite movie use to be ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" until ""Empire of the Sun"" was released.Whatever the reasons are for people not liking this movie, I guess that is their problem.

Engaging serious 1980s Spielberg film.,"Insightful drama from 1987 directed by Steven Spielberg. The story loosely follows events in the Pacific region as China and Japan are at war. The U. S. become involved after Pearl Harbor leading to the atom bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.The film has a good cast including a pre-teen Christian Bale as posh English schoolboy Jim, John Malkovich and Nigel Havers. I also recognised Leslie Phillips from the Carry On films. The story is told over three or so hours as the few English in Shanghai become pawns in the China/Japan conflict. Bale plays Jim and it is his painful journey that is followed. A journey that sees him separated from his parents, become a prisoner in a prisoner of war camp until the end of the war before being reunited with his parents at the end of the war.The film embarks on a journey that has been explored many times but has a degree of excellence in Spielberg's direction. The variety of Spielberg's work holds no bounds. Empire Of The Sun is one of his more serious efforts from the 1980s alongside The Color Purple (1985). Perhaps thirty or so minutes could have been edited from the three hour or so run time but I was left fully engaged with the film.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Beautiful journey,"Empire of the sun is the second most underrated movie I have ever seen - right after Oliver Stone's ""The Doors"". Furthermore it is perhaps the best movie Steven Spielberg has done. Just like with ""The Doors"", you have to keep wondering why it has been accepted so poorly.In the end whether you like this movie or not, goes back to the question of how you think about its perspective on the events of WW2 in the ""Empire of the sun"". Some people might not even have consciously noticed that the emotional perspective of the movie is purely guided by a child's few but felt just uncomfortable about its lack of realism - and those who did consciously notice, might have neglected it merely for the fact itself.As defense those who did like the movie have pointed out the deep symbolism, others have for good reason referred to its uniquely beautiful imagery. But there is something far more valuable about this movie: It is just the perspective mentioned above. What you may notice as beauty inside this movie, what others may have felt irritated about, is just its emotional point of few, which seems ""out of this world"" in the true sense of the word. In a child's mind everything you see gets a meaning different of what we are used to and often shines bright for seemingly no reason. Like this the time in an internment camp can seem like a joyful adventure, while life's disappointments can easily break your world. Like this the borders between the sides might blur as well as between right or wrong. And like this you will finally see, and have to see, the absurdity of the witnessed events, of the war itself.Like this and only like this, the movie develops a slow and highly surreal maelstrom of narration, which together with breath taking images might seem almost meditative. A seldom experience of a movie!",9.0,Anonymous,History
Practice for Schindler's List,"This movie feels like practice for Schindler. While it's not nearly as emotionally rich or mature, Empire of the Sun is more beautiful & visually interesting than I remember. The scene of Jamie discovered the remnants of a struggle in the spilled sugar is showy but undeniably masterful.

Pretentious and stupid,Christian Bale is absolutely the most obnoxious lead actor It has ever been my misfortune to watch for three hours -- and he's the BEST part of the film.  This began Spielberg's artistic phase when he started reinventing himself as an artist so he could finally win Academy Awards.  This may have paid off for him but is extraordinarily painful to the audience.  This isn't even worth watching as a joke.  My score: 1 out of 10,1.0,Anonymous,History
Pretty good Spielberg film about a 11-year-old boy separated from his family when China is invaded by Japan at the onset of WWII.,"1941. The Japanese are occupying much of China in the Chinese-Japanese War. Diplomatic security protects the International Settlement in Shanghai, the many westerners there still leading a very comfortable, western-styled life. Jim Graham: Christian Bale, an upper-class British boy, lives in Shanghai in the early 40s. He is a pampered, privileged and protected child who, overnight, begins to suffer the disasters and consequences of the Japanese invasion during the Second World War. While his family decides to flee, he gets lost in the street and finds himself alone facing the risks and dangers of the invasion. He is interred in a prison camp and is thrust into a life of poverty and discomfort. Even though he is separated from his parents and in a hostile environment, Jamie maintains his dignity and youthful spirits, providing a beacon of hope for the others held captive with him. To survive in a world at war, he must find a strength greater than all the events that surround him !.A coming-of-age story where a boy alone has to face the hardships of war, and sent to a concentration camp he will have to face all kinds of difficulties and dangers while he knows all kinds of misfortunes. Throughout this process his way of understanding life has changed radically. Spielberg's mature, extraordinarily
vivid return to real storytelling, from best-selling epic J. G. Ballard novel. A mysterious, sensitive and breathtaking work in which Spielberg's heightened juvenile romanticism has a real, heartbreaking context. There's no denying the power of the human level and the amazing piezes especially the evacuation of Shanghai, some aerial takes and starring's flight through swamp scrub outside in which he spends most of his time. The picture takes most the attention in Christian Bale but there's a strong British cast contingent as Paul McGann in an early role, Miranda Richardson , Nigel Havers, Emily Richard, Leslie Phillips, Robert Stephens, Rupert Frazer, and brief appearance from Joe Pantoliano and Ben Stiller. And John Malkovich's opportunistic 'King Rat' type threatens to become a fully developed role but never follows through. Special mention for the rousing, moving musical score by veteran John Williams, Spielberg's regular. As well as colorful and evocative cinematography by director of photography Allen Daviau.At the same era, two films were made in a similar style dealing with children subjected to the vicissitudes and misfortunes of WWII: ¬®Au revoir les enfants¬®by Louis Malle and ¬®Hope and glory¬®by John Boorman, these 1987 releases also explore the sad memories of young boys. ¬®Empire of the sun¬® was superbly directed by Spielberg that he always likes with telling his stories from a child's point of view. Here Steven maintains the whole nightmarish situation at total tension and fever pitch. When Spielberg decided to direct this fabulous film, of which he was initially only going to produce, he gave an important turn to his film career, at that time in full swing as a master of adventure cinema. From his film debut ¬®Sugarland Express¬®, Spielberg's career has been impressive. Although his first one was actually ¬®Duel¬® with Dennis Weaver while in US it premiered in Television, it was released threatically in Europe. Spielberg successful film to be continued by a series of hits, such as : ¬®Jaws, Close encounters in third phase , Raiders of the lost ark, ET, The color purple, Amazing stories, Empire of the sun, Hook, Jurassic Park, Amistad, Schindler list, Lost world, A. I. , Minority report, The terminal, Munich, War of the words, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indiana Jones and the last crusade¬® and many others in an uncountable list as in direction as in production. Rating : Notable, better than average, 8/10. An absolute cracker that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Good, but restrained","I just saw this movie. The first thing I had to get over was that I instantly recognized Christian Bale as the lead child. Ordinarily I wouldn't have to ""get over"" that, but since I have seen him in the magnificent American Pysco, it was hard to forget that he played that and he was just an innocent child.Once I got over that, I felt the movie was relatively good. It didn't have the brutality the Japanese most assuredly had for the English while they were in the camp. In fact, there was almost an aversion to showing any brutality from the oppressor. It was a little disappointing.However, it was incredibly interesting to see how my in-laws could have had it if they hadn't gotten out of there when they did. I did have an emotionally moment when he sees his parents - it was awful. I couldn't imagine. The parents were kind of stale, but Bale rose to the occasion. He has a strong future!",7.0,Anonymous,History
Speilberg Was Robbed,"I wouldn't have been surprised if 'The Last Emperor' still got the best picture Oscar that year, but for this film not be nominated - while the likes of 'Moonstruck' was - was CRIMINAL.Script, to casting, to acting, to direction, to cinematography, to the score - all flawless.It's like it was held out because, ""we can't have 2 movies centered in Asia!""
Absurd.I almost wonder if it is because Japan was portrayed so negatively - and the late 80s were when America was heavily invested in Japan.Christian Bale is phenomenal in his performance - setting the stage for the career that would follow.John Malkovich and Joe Pantoliano are also great.Matter of fact, everyone in the show are great in their roles.Even Ben Stiller makes an appearance, before he broke off into comedy.If you haven't seen, a must watch.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Most overlooked Spielberg Movie,"I had never heard of this film until a few months ago when everyone was talking about Saving Private Ryan.  In one of the behind the scenes shows they showed, they said Spielberg made a lot of wwII movies, and they showed that clip of ""Empire of the Sun"" when Jim is jumping up and down and yelling ""B-51 cadillac of the sky!!!"" and I thought it was awesome.  I decided to rent the movie and I just couldn't understand what made this movie so overlooked.  I mean, it didn't even get nominated for best picture OR director.  Even though lots of critics disliked it, they couldn't have helped but seen the start of Spielberg's emotional wwII movies.  I mean, this movie has all the ingredients of a great emotional Spielberg movie:great script (which by the way was written by one of those involved in Shakespeare in Love...), great acting, ""a little lost kid""(there was a lot of that in Schindler and also Upham in Private Ryan), and of course, the great John Williams score that always adds that extra emotion. I mean seriously, a lot of scenes in that movie were just John Williams moments...like the scene where Jim throw the plane back to the Japanese guy, and of course, the b-51 scene.  If you're looking for an awesome drama, especially after seeing Saving Private Ryan, this is a good calmer wwII movie that still manages to make you feel like crap in a way(and Spielberg is now happy).",7.0,Anonymous,History

Was the narrative portrayed in a gripping manner? Yes, you could immerse yourself and empathize with the characters as the story unfolds. Was the camerawork extraordinary? Extraordinary is a strong word, maybe a little bit above average in my honest opinion.I don't give 10 lightly to many movies, however when you add up all the finely made parts combined with some powerful moments and passion from the characters it arouses the senses and gives intense joy for the short interval of time, that you watch the movie.

terrible seeing it again,"This was my favorite film as a kid, from the age of about 5-9 I would watch it every Christmas, and i thought it was amazing, the music, seeing the war, the death, people dying, people get shot, every little detail in this film stayed with me, and I could remember everything. I loved being scared by this film, and being so sad by the music, and parts where certain characters die, such as the part where the kamikaze soldier offers James a peach, then as he's about to cut it with his samurai sword, gets shot in the throat, and you see the blood spill down onto the peach, this was all amazing stuff for me, seriously.... HOWEVER I decided to watch the film again for the first time in about 11 years, i'm 20 now,  and from beginning to end I was SHOCKED at how bad this film is... everything is cliched, the acting and script is rubbish, the shots aren't special, everything I remembered as special is cheesey and just ridiculous!! I will no longer recommend this film to anyone, apart from parents who have kids 5-9, if their children have an imagination like I did then they will probably find this film special too, it made me grow up a bit a learn some important things in life.

Breathtaking!!,"Having just watched this film, one dimension sticks out, namely the acting of young Christian Bale.

Astounding,"I first watched 'Empire of the Sun' fairly recently and I'm appalled with myself for never watching such a masterpiece earlier.Empire of the Sun is a film adaption of the popular autobiography by JG Ballard which follows the life of a young boy, Jim (played by Christian Bale) where he embarks on an unforgettable and life-changing adventure when Shanghai is invaded by Japanese troops during World War 2.Jim is separated from his parents and is forced to fend for himself on the streets of Shanghai. He eventually befriends an American called Basie (John Malkovich) and together they survive the Japanese internment camps run by the Japs.A spectacular performance by a young Bale and a realistic representation of the War marks this film one of the greatest of our generation.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A solid Spielberg film,"I feel like this might be a lesser Spielberg movie, but even ordinary or slightly underwhelming by the director's standards is still significantly better than many other filmmakers have managed.Empire of the Sun really benefits from a very young Christian Bale giving a seriously good performance; not just by child performance standards either. Everyone else is pretty good, and the film looks good and is scored well.It does drag a bit at points, with a somewhat bloated 2.5-hour runtime, and I think like The Color Purple from around the same time, the tone feels a bit all over the place. It's also possible to criticise how sanitised it feels for a war movie, besides some more intense scenes near the beginning and the fact that characters look pretty dirty and haggard towards the film's end.Overall, it's good.

A modern classic,"This is one of my all time favorite movies. There something about the idea of the story thats so appealing. Most stories about WWII are about battles. However, the two greatest movies about WWII, Casablanca and Empire of the Sun, go deeper into the personal trails of characters during a time when emotions and feelings were supposed to be on the back burner. The main character in this film is superb in showing what patriotism is all about. Hes English but has never been there and understands the Chinese (where he lives and grew up) better than his own people. Its a tale of the War that slipped through the cracks and never got told, the English that were trapped in China during WWII. I can see how this can be a little dry for some viewers but if you understand that this is a character study versus an action film it is a little easier to enjoy. Also, its strongly based on a true story with events that are spot on accurate. It is in my humble opinion the greatest ""coming of age"" movie ever made. Besides, when the producers of this movie are Steven Spielberg, Frank Marshall, Kathleen Kennedy and Robert Shapiro its a little hard to think this movie is a ""miss"".

It was incredible seeing this young boy, raised with every advantage in the world, thrown into such a complex situation without anything to fall back onto. He has to grow up in an unforgiving world, desperately trying to hold onto the memory of his parents.The acting in this movie is incredible, features veterans like John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson and Joe Pantoliano and a then new-comer Christian Bale. It's actually hard to just call it 'acting', because their performances feel so real. The direction is incredible, it's a side of Steven Spielberg we'll probably never see again, mixing real-life with a child's view of the war so seamlessly that you barely notice you're being shown a skewed look at reality.

The story requires the length of the movie as it is extremely deep and full of little details that need to be included in order to achieve the full emotional effect. Of course it is worthless to say that the big break of Christian Bale could not have been more impressive. He turns this into so much more than the normal coming-of-age movie with astonishing facial expressions and acting well beyond his tender age at the time.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Utterly offensive,"Whatever its artistic merits, the subtle implications of Spielberg's Empire of the Sun convey a far more sinister impression both of the director's distorted view of history and his readily apparent hypocrisy.It still shocks me the sheer number of individuals who seem to have misinterpreted this film as condemning atrocities as perpetrated by the Imperial Japanese Army. As such, consider the facts.In the film, the Japanese Army regulars never kill so much as a single person, implying that the worst of its conduct relied upon repossessing real estate and partially neglecting the medical and sustenance needs of westerners in captivity.The Chinese are portrayed as babbling idiots, whose ( as Spielberg implies) readily apparent hysteria ultimately separated Jamie from his family. In fact, the biggest nemesis to Christain Bale embodies that of a homeless Chinese boy who attempts to rob and beat him. Furthermore, the fact that Japanese troops apparently perpetuated little more than a repossession of real estate and confiscation of a slightly greater portion of food resources tends to imply the panicked crowds of Chinese attempting to flee the Japanese occupation as guilty of rampant paranoia and hysteria, considering that (according to Spielberg) they had little to fear from their impending occupants.Mind you, I have no qualms whatsoever of Spielberg's incentive to portray the Japanese as multidimensional humans, offset by some individuals who perpetrated reprehensible acts; that's fine. However, comparing his readily apparent sense of moral outrage as a contextual misinterpretation leads to the killing of a well-intentioned Japanese pilot by one of the main characters to the more than subtle implications of Saving PRivate Ryan that attempts to perpetuate excuses for Americans who executed unarmed German prisoners lays bear the directors affinity for insufferable hypocrisy.And, as one reviewer already pointed out, the story focuses primarily on the (not so severe, as Spielberg implies) maltreatment of white detention camp victims, rather than upon the Chinese who endured far worse at the hands of a doctrine that, like Naziism, perpetuated a sense of racial purity. Indeed, one cannot help but wonder whether Spielberg shares this imperial doctrine by envisioning the Japanese as racially superior the remaining occupants of the Pacific and Southeast Asia.Only after Munich has Spielberg begun to show even the faintest traces of either maturity or objectivity. However, he'll require a lot more deeds before overcoming his legitimate (however non-official) status as one of the world's pre-eminent hypocrites.",2.0,Anonymous,History

The cinematography is excellent, and Christian Bale acts his role very well, it's true. However, the plot is muddled and the conclusion is cliche Hollywood to the core.

Amazing historical movie based on a true story.,"Main protagonist is a high-society British boy dropped into the harsh environment of Shanghai during WW2 and has to ensure his own survival.Steven Spielberg delivered a very well made a mixture of the four cultures - Japanese, Chinese, British and American, with behavior patterns and nuances typical to each nationality. The magnificence of the Shanghai metropolis and the tragedy of the civilians facing the cruelty of wartime were remarkable.However, the most amazing thing in this movie is the boy Jamie Graham (young Christian Bale). Having a rich imagination and wisdom, Jamie tells to his mom that God, in his dream, was playing in tennis, and he assumes that if people can see God in their dreams, perhaps God sees humans in His dreams too.Jamie not only has his own opinions, but he also has his own vision. While adults, using logic and statistics, calculating the potential outcome of the war on the number of people and weapons, Jamie notes that the war will be won by someone who has COURAGE and that COURAGE is a national value of the Japanese.Separated from his parents by a cruel destiny, Jamie tries to survive in his new situation. Hunger is a driving force for the boy, who looks for opportunities.Gut feelings or intuition is helping him escape from a big evil - a Chinese street boy - and to join a smaller one - an American pragmatist called Basie. Giving a portion of the rice to Jamie, Basie has a far-fetched plan - to sell the boy - but his plan failed. Jamie is observing and learning the Art of surviving.Driven by a strong will to get through, Jamie is taking a University of life from Basie. Death is all around, but Basie is teaching Jim (his nickname for Jamie) to see opportunities even from the dead, whether it be an extra potato or pair of the golf shoes.At a certain point, Jamie even jumped above his teacher's head and saved lives of a British doctor and his patients.We see atomic bomb's explosion in front of Jamie's eyes. The boy amazingly compares the flash of it with the snapshot done by God.The end of the movie is HAPPY - Jamie is reunited with his parents.This movie a good recommendation to be watched by the whole family, and few times.",10.0,Anonymous,History

A young boy who is separated form his parents during the Japanese invasion of China during the second world war. Bale completely held my attention throughout the film, and is really remarkable.

Empire of the Sun: an epic masterpiece from Steven Spielberg!,"Steven Spielberg is by far one of the greatest directors in history. His imagination and brilliance has reached us all on some emotional level. Of all Spielberg's films, Empire of the Sun seems to be his least known as well as highly underrated. It wasn't a blockbuster hit like his previous films Jaws, Close Encounters, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and E.T. Yet, Empire of the Sun is a huge hit with myself and many other fans who express their satisfaction with this film.Empire of the Sun is the story of Jim, a boy who grows up in the least desired circumstances. He grows up in the outbreak of World War II, in a foreign country, in chaos, and, most depressingly, without parents. Jim, an extraordinary character, must learn to survive in this new world. What seems to be a frightening experience, Jim not only survives, but he exceeds well at it. Of course, the pains of war take their toll on Jim which makes for a very heart-wrenching story told very well by Spielberg. Simply put, it is a story about a child's loss of innocence. It is a story of war seen through a child's eyes.Empire of the Sun is a film not fully appreciated as it should be. It deserves all the praise it is given. It was nominated for 6 Academy Awards, winner of 3 BAFTA awards from 6 nominations, and a Golden Globe nominee for Best Motion Picture and Best Original Score. It was given highest honors from the National Board of Review for Best Film of 1987 with Steven Spielberg receiving an NBR award Best Director, and Christian Bale was given a special NBR award for Best Juvenile Performance. With excellent direction from Spielberg, a very moving score from John Williams, and an unforgettable performance from the very young Christian Bale, Empire of the Sun makes for one of Spielberg's best. After seeing the film once, it became a personal favorite and an instant classic in my mind. Empire of the Sun is my personal favorite of all Spielberg's films, and I know after you see it you'll never forget it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Brilliant and touching!,"Starting from the way the story is conveyed and the dialogue is written to the superb acting that is delivered throughout the movie, everything about Empire of the Sun is magnificent. It oozes a touch of Steven Spielberg though in a very down-to-earth manner, which gives the piece a unique and interesting quality while still having the element of Spielberg's excellent storytelling. The story itself, though occurring alongside real events in the World's history, doesn't focus on any particular event or their importance to the world but rather on their importance on the main character's life and on how each event impacts him and the lives of those around him. It's much more than just a movie about war, it's about a boy's journey through adolescence after suffering an enormous rupture with his comfortable and luxurious life, following his struggle to survive, to find his parents, to keep his dreams alive and his despair to stay connected to the people he encounters. The main character, Jamie, is certainly one of a kind, being a devious and peculiar boy while still managing to carry the innocence and naivety of the child he is, which makes us be interested in this person and in the transformation he undergoes. Certainly, such a complex and multifaceted character could potentially prevent the general public from relating to him or understanding him and yet I still found myself doing exactly that and enjoying every moment of the movie. Most definitely, part of that is owed to the exceptional performance given to us by Christian Bale, who truly made Jamie come to life by making the character and his quirks extremely believable. Little moments in which the extent of his commitment shows through make his acting brim on perfect. After all, even just small details make the difference (like the fact that after shouting on a rooftop with all the strength his lungs allowed him he then tries to speak but his voice is raspy and nearly failing). The fusion of Bale's acting with the character's power and depth and the fantastic way of how things were put together make us go enthusiastic in one second to suddenly feel our heart breaking in the next. Just like Jamie, I was left feeling both amazed and in awe as I stood at the edge of a metaphorical abyss and though I could tell why I had gone from laughing at his childishness to start sobbing in the next second I couldn't tell how such transition had been done so swiftly and quickly, being yet so natural.In sum, an excellent piece which I would recommend to anyone who enjoys profound but entertaining movie.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Why I hate this film with a passion,"I watched this film when I was a teenager, and for years I wanted to write a review on this. Now that I have read some of the comments here, I have recently made an exception to rent and watch this again, hoping that I would somehow find it less, er, upsetting as I am older now and less affected by my own self-imposed political correctness. The answer is, still NO. And I will continue to make a point NOT to see any Steven Spielberg's movies JUST because of this film.Here's my problem. As a Chinese, I feel this strong empathy with the Jewish community as we, as a race, were both victimized during WWII. Them by the Nazi, we by the Japanese. I can also only watch with envy as a lot of Jewish film makers (especially those in the US, including Mr. Spielberg himself) continue to make movies/documentaries to remember the victims and the courage of many people that were trying to make a difference and save a lot of people from the sheer brutality of the aggressors.And what the most important Jewish film maker (or just film maker) of this generation did with a story that happened in China during WWII. The film is obviously not about our suffering, and that's fine because it's based on a story of a British boy who got caught. However, in the first 15 mins of the film, when Chinese characters briefly appeared, they were either very cruel (like the housemaids trying to steal things from the British boy's home, and hit him when the boy trying to stop them) or just simply thugs/thieves.If that's not enough, the boy, no doubt was in a lot of distress and going through a lot of unstable emotions while in the war prisoner camp, found some sort of emotional alliance with a young Japanese soldier who had been trying but failed to become part of an ""elite"" team of pilots whose only duty at that point of the war was to carry out suicide missions. As commented by another user here the brutality of the camp was kept to a minimum, I don't know why as there is plenty in the book. But what we see in this movie, correct me if I am wrong, is that those pilots are being glorified (or in some symbolic sort of way, the ""courage"" of the Japanese army) as told by film maker's version of the boy's prospective.One could only imagine what reaction it would provoke IF this film, with more or less the same storyline, was about, say, a British boy in Prague being capture and sent to a camp by the Nazi during WWII.A bit of history. Shanghai was a safe haven for a lot of Jewish people in Germany and Europe who couldn't make it to the US and Canada from the 1930s onward. They could go there without passports and, though had to face the Japanese army like the Chinese, at least be saved from systemic murders in Europe. From all historical accounts, they were being treated kindly by the local Chinese.And here's the reason why I have not watched a single film directed by Mr. Spielberg even since I saw the Empire of the Sun (mid-1980s).",,Anonymous,History
The Best Spielberg Film to Date,"I believe this is Spielberg's best film, and him being my favorite director means the best film ever. This is a bold claim for a film, but it lives up to the hype.I saw this film when i was 15, about Jim's age in the end of the film. I thought that the film had affected me because of my age but not because of its quality (the remake of Lord of the Flies had that effect).I spent a few years hunting down the DVD, and was amazed to like the film even more the second time around. Since i have lobbied my friends (who don't like this kind of film) to watch it. Not even one of them where disappointed with the film even with the high expectations they had after my boldest claims.From the outset it is obvious why David Lean was originally set to Direct the film, it is epic in scale but like Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge on the River Kwai, the main character is very well developed as are the supporting ones.The story in Empire is not plot based or moved but rather realistically follows the emotions of Jim, played masterfully by a young Christian Bale). From his easy comfortable living before the Second World War to his time separated from his parents in a Japanese internment camp.This films only flaw, one i don't mind but many viewers might not like is that the film is quite slow. But like films like the last emperor the slow pace helps us care about the characters and gives them space to breath.Everything in this film is perfect, the script, the performances, the photography and one of the best music scores ever written by the always brilliant John Williams.Since i seen it only 3 other films came close to affect me as much as this did. They where the Shawshank Redemption, Lawrence of Arabia and Oh What a lovely war.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Brilliant, beautiful, poignant, touching","Empire of the Sun is such a terrific movie. It is a shame it never received the accolades it should have. I'll never understand why, even today, critics look down upon this film. It is truly brilliant.The key to this entire film is the way the filmmakers framed the entirety of the Chinese wartime saga through the eyes of a British boy. The film is broad in scope, with sweeping vistas and immense crowd scenes. But the heart of the film is concentrated, focused, into the character of Jamie Graham, outstandingly played by young Christian Bale.The writers really got into the head of this 12-year-old boy. This kid goes through so many changes, like all children do, and you're with him, every step of the way. They start him off as a spoiled brat, then suspend him in a state of shock as riots hit the streets of Shanghai. Then they put him on his own, where he makes safe yet foolish decisions. Then he becomes enamored with a less-than-savory role model. He moves through survivor to panderer and even has a touch of hormone-induced lust. Towards the end, he even investigates his own spirituality. All the while the effects of war rumble on around him.The best of all war movies focus on a few, or even one, characters. It's so easy to wash away all the soul of a film by focusing on large battle sequences or broad vistas. By capturing the soul of the people caught up in war, you capture the soul of the war itself. Spielberg does this so brilliantly here, he has made a terrific film.It's a shame others don't feel that way.10 out of 10. A perennial favorite.Barky",10.0,Anonymous,History
A Truly Moving Film,"I am in my 60's, but had not seen this film until the other evening. It is now one of my top ten of all time.Christian Bale is truly amazing in this movie. His ability to project a wide array of emotions on the screen should have earned him an Oscar. Filmgoers who only know him as Batman or the good guy in 3:10 To Yuma, simply must see him in this film.The other cast members are fine, with Malkovich playing a character not dissimilar to that which he played in The Killing Fields. And I was surprised to see Ben Stiller as a very young guy in this film.Spielberg, as usual, captures the realism of the moment, particularly in the Japanese prison camp. And he is truly a genius in getting phenomenal performances from youngsters.I strongly recommend this film to anyone who, like me, has waited too long to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"The best movie ever made epical, emotional and very touching 10 of 10","I watched this movie the other day and I am so impressed by every single detail. Actually, I wish everyone to watch it. It tells a story about the pacific WWII through a child eyes. The movie begins at the Jim's fancy life (Christian Bale) showing the contrast life in Shanghai of the wealthy people (the British and the American) and the other Chinese people outside the international settlements in Shanghai. Then, and in a dramatic change, the Japanese forces invade those international settlements in Shanghai letting another era of Jim's life to begin. He meets his new American friend Basie (John Malkovich) and later on they are arrested by the Japanese and they moved to the camp. Jim quickly accommodate with his new life and taking the rule of a mature boy. The adventures begin till the American army come to Shanghai and the Japanese release the prisoners. The last scene of the movie is very very touching; it is the reunion scene, when Jim meets again his parents. Frankly, I couldn't deny myself from throwing tears at this sensitive scene. The soundtracks of the movie are fabulous; they are full of humanity and emotions. Thanks to Mr. John Williams for this masterpiece music. In my opinion, it is the best movie ever of the director Mr. Steven Spielberg. Actually, I watched the making of this movie (the Chinese Odyssey) and it is very obvious the efforts which done (dealing with the massive crowds, making the airplanes, shooting the powerful scenes). I can't thank Mr. Spielberg enough for this movie. It is sad fact that it didn't win any Oscar with regards to its 6 nominations. I think that it should be at the top of IMDb. It is really underrated; one of Spielberg's most underrated. I must say that it is one of Spielberg's most underestimated films. One last thing that I wish to have the ability to erase this movie from my mind and to watch again and again to have the feelings and emotions of this movie refreshed each time.

A forgotten corner of war,"This a a story of loss. Loss of empire, both British and Japanese and of innocence, of the character played by a young Christian Bale, who turns in a superbly nuanced performance, uncommon amongst thirteen year old actors. Born of empire but not of England we see the main protagonist, Jim played by Bale admire, what is the Japanese war machine, mostly their airforce. This does make one feel somewhat uncomfortable but due to the complete lack of British or any other allied military power in the region, it is the only military role model he has. Perhaps this underlines, that we are products of our immediate experience and not some codified ideal written in tablets of stone. The film is long at two and a half hours; though directed by Spielberg, I doubt very much that even he, would get away with that today and it would probably benefit from some judicious editing as many of the latter scenes add little value to the message of this film. Seeing this film at the cinema, thirty years ago as a callow youth, I would have been surprised that the young actor Bale, would become an international super star but having seen it for the first time since, tonight; I wonder with such a performance, how could it have been otherwise.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Although the photography, special effects and scenes of battle are amazingly shot to make you feel a part of the action, it is the personal story of a young boy becoming a man that is compelling.

A 153 minute onslaught of stupidity.,"I stumbled across the existence of this movie just a couple of months ago, 30 years ago after its release. I'm not quite sure how I missed it back in 1987 but based on a score of 7.8 on IMDb and an overwhelming number of its reviews including the word ""masterpiece"" I was determined to seek it out and mentally prepared for a mind- blowing experience. I was therefore delighted to find it in the ""classics"" section of the movies on-board a recent international flight. It is not often that movies fail from the first frame, but this one did, literally. It begins with an overlong shot of some dirty water, some petals appear, then some pieces of wood, which in time turn out to be a number of wooden coffins. We zoom out to see a Japanese warship collide with them. So ends the first 2 or 3 minutes of this movie, showing a ridiculous situation which adds absolutely nothing to the story. We might be thinking, OK, well, the director has satisfied his ego and got the arty, gratuitous shot off his chest, now on to the real movie. But, alas, it was not to be so. The ""plot"" of this movie, and I use that word generously, is the picaresque meanderings of an obnoxious little boy to become an obnoxious slightly older boy over the period 1941 to 1945. This consists of a non-stop string of the most ridiculous, contrived, unnatural, laughable episodes you might have the misfortune to imagine. I made it to an hour and 20 minutes only because I could just not believe what I was seeing - it was, in its own masochistic way, fascinating, like watching a train crash. I will not bore you with the details of particular absurdities, but I am confident that if requested I could make a minute by minute itemised list of cringe-worthy examples. I was somewhat incredulous to find that this movie was based on a well respected ""semi-autobiography"" (whatever that is) by J.G. Ballard. That surely means that in its original form it had some redeeming qualities and that the author was not in fact anything like the ridiculous character in the film. Surely, hopefully, there has been a titanic ""loss in translation"" somewhere in the movie making process. I do not know if J.G. Ballard, Tom Stoppard or Stephen Spielberg is to blame but the screenplay is beyond execrable. It is as if it has been written by someone raised in a cave by wolves whose only knowledge of humans is from reading books. No man, woman or child I have ever known has acted, or spoken the way EVERYONE does in this movie. To say that EVERY character is a caricature would be an understatement, they are caricatures of caricatures. The Chinese are caricatures. The British are caricatures. The Americans are caricatures. The Japanese are caricatures. I also did not realise until after watching the movie that the ""boy"" was acted by Christian Bale. This I found astonishing as there are not so many movies about the 2nd Sino-Japanese war, the only one I know being ""The flowers of war"" in which Christian Bale also plays the lead role. Apart from staring Christian Bale both these films are similar in that they feature ridiculous characters in ridiculous situations. No offense to Mr Bale, he makes the best of a bad lot, but he does seem to be a bit of a jinx in this historical era. I realise that ""Empire of the sun"" is based on a ""semi-auto biography"" but it seems bizarre to me that the only movies of this historical era of China have British or American characters as their leads. Frankly, in an era in which millions of Chinese were being slaughtered or starved to death, why should I give a toss about the privileged treatment of a British boy, and a thoroughly unpleasant one at that? Perhaps one day we will get a real movie on this subject that will finally do it some justice. I do not know if the reverence for the Japanese that is so frequently flaunted in this movie is simply a reflection of J.G Ballard's original book, or something added by Spielberg or Stoppard. While I understand that in these enlightened times all the nations of the World are supposed to sit around the camp fire and sing ""Kumbaya"", it has to be said World War 2 was not Japan's finest hour as human beings. Therefore it seems not only strange but in poor taste that the Spielberg who recognises the horrors inflicted by the Germans on humanity in ""Schindler's List"" fails to recognise those inflicted by the Japanese in this movie, and in this respect it is an insult to the millions of civilian and military casualties. In fact, when I think about it, this movie is pretty much an insult to everybody. It is an insult to children, who do not behave like they do in this movie. It is an insult to adults, who do not behave as they do in this movie. It is an insult to every nationality represented. It is an insult to veterans. And it is an insult to the intelligence of the audience.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Spielberg's best,"When I was 10, my family was taken from our home by war, with only 20 minutes notice, never to return. Like the boy in the film, this event marked for me a transition from childhood to manhood. The glow of the A-bomb attack reflected the transition of the world to a new future. An amazing saga of triumph whilst maturing, the characters include the entire gamut of human emotion and morality. The challenge of the young boy to the POW camp officer is particularly instructive for those seeking motivation on success in difficult circumstances. Good versus evil. The film should be used as an educational tool to inform the spoiled current generation of young people who have been protected from the realities of history, a missing lesson that will most likely lead to a less fortunate future. All parents should watch it with their children.",,Anonymous,History

A war film with a difference,"'Empire of the Sun' is probably one of the most unique war films out there as it doesn't balk from showing the harsh realities of war but we see it all through the eyes of a child. And, in many ways, it is a rather tragic war drama since it deals with both the deaths of soldiers and civilians but also the death of a child's innocence as he struggles to comprehend the brutal truth of the situation he is in.The hero of the film is twelve-year-old Jim, an English boy living in China with his upper class family in 1941 when the Japanese invade. Separated from his parents, he is left to cope on the streets alone only to be captured and placed in a Japanese PoW camp. As he befriends fellow British and American captives, Jim struggles to find his feet in a world where the days of being pampered are over but also where he is forced to take his first premature steps into manhood when, at heart, he is still very much a child. When the war finally draws to an end with Japan's defeat, Jim is left to find his parents, no longer the little boy he was when they were first separated.Welsh-born Christian Bale was just absolutely first class as young Jim. He would only have been twelve or so when filming but his performance proved there are some child actors who can show incredible talent that out-shines adult counterparts and he brings innocence, hope and spirit to his character. It's not surprising he is one of the few child actors who grew up able to carve an acting career in adulthood instead of falling by the wayside. The adult cast of John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson and Nigel Havers are also solid, supporting Bale's performance without pushing themselves to the forefront as this is very much his film.One of the most beautiful things about this film is that it can be enjoyed by those of all ages. I was about ten when I first saw 'Empire of the Sun', perceiving it then as an adventure and cheering Jim along on his journey. When I saw it again about eight or so years later, I was able to better appreciate the themes of lost innocence, determination, loss, hope and spirit that saw a generation survive through World War Two. Much like the Japanese anime 'Grave of the Fireflies', this film strives to portray Jim's tenacity without losing the message that war is no place for a child and the innocent always suffer first in the midst of battle. Directed with masterful grace by Steven Spielberg, 'Empire of the Sun' is probably one of his best films yet.",,Anonymous,History

"Awesome movie, very detailed","I still rent and watch this movie for really only one scene. And even as I viewed the trailer to this movie moments ago on this website, it made my heart beat faster. The scene where the beautiful, lovely war machine known as the P-51 Mustang in her silver sleek skin flew by the building that had the 12-year old standing atop, yelling at the top of his lungs, ""P-51, Cadillac of the Sky"" repeatedly. In enters the roar, power, and beauty of the American air supremacy that we enjoyed back when the P-51 was in her day. The pilot had his canopy slung back, and his scarf trailing in the air still is impressed in my image. For this boy, the man piloting this beautiful plane was god-like. The scene captured all the emotion of that moment, and I tip my hat to Steven Spielberg for creating such a wonderful image that is probably my favorite scene in any movie overall. Why? The love affair we had with WWII planes and also the new planes that exist today.

I did feel empathy for him when he was alone in his house but after that I didn't feel much. There was something missing from the performance here-frankly, he wasn't a warm character. In fact, there isn't even one character that I truly loved in this film and for me that is very, very unusual. I like all types of films and I think my collection reflects that. But this didn't work for me. Therefore, I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone. I found the documentary that comes with the film much more interesting than the film itself.

One of Spielberg's Most Ambitious Efforts!,"My thoughts are complicated regarding Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun. It is one of the director's most ambitious films and it has a strong narrative pull that displays the notions you would come to expect in a Spielberg film; child separated from his parents, child finding hope and magic, etc.). At times, I was drawn away from the film because the kid, named Jim, is a spoiled brat. I gather that was the intention of Spielberg and writer Tom Stoppard, but holy moly that kid was annoying...especially in the beginning. But through the terrors of war, maybe he will learn a lesson or two. With that in mind, the film is beautifully photographed thanks to Allen Daviau's camerawork. The production design is excellent as I felt the Japanese POW camp felt authentic. As usual, John Williams crafted another beautiful score which is par for a Spielberg movie. Any narrative shortcomings were made up (to a degree) on the technical side of things.
The film was based on the autobiography of J.G. Ballard who had a very similar experience to Jim. Playwright Tom Stoppard adapted the autobiography for the big screen. Before Spielberg came aboard, David Lean was attached to direct with Spielberg onboard to produce. One might remember that Lean, in 1957, directed a famous movie about Japanese POW: The Bridge over River Kwai which happens to be one of Spielberg's favorite films. Lean ultimately decided to hand over the film to Spielberg because despite his interest in the story, he felt it was more like a diary and Spielberg is more of a suitable director. This is the kind of story that speaks out to Spielberg because of his childhood. The themes of child abandonment and World War II spoke out to him. And by the tiny details and way the story was told, you could tell Spielberg gave his heart to the film. Perhaps too much of it because the film is long and includes too much in my opinion, but the love is there. Speaking of length, this is actually one of the final films to include an intermission. I know, a fun fact!
It is 1941, in the midst of the Sino-Japanese War. The International Community in Shanghai is protected due to diplomacy rights. Jamie Graham otherwise known as Jim (Christian Bale) is a 12-year-old British citizen living the comfortable, wealthy life with his parents. He is also a snobby kid who believes everyone should speak English. He is also an expert on airplanes and could tell you the make and model of the plane just by its silhouette. When the Japanese bomb Pearl Harbor, life changes for this community. The Western folks are told to evacuate immediately and in the process, young Jim is separated from his folks. He ends up at a Japanese POW camp where he is taken under the wings of Basie (John Malkovich). If the kid wants to survive to the end of the war, he might want an attitude makeover and realize how self-absorbed he was, which may have been a catalyst of the plot.
As an adult actor, Christian Bale is one of the best actors to grace this planet. It is most likely the point of the screenplay, but this particular Bale performance turned me off with his self-absorbed demeanor. Kudos to Bale for embracing a kid whose qualities are the worst. He does have a nice redemption act as the film progresses. I did like John Malkovich's performance. He was not a father figure for Bale but rather a person who tolerated his presence because he could get away with things in the POW camp because of his age and size. Also, young Ben Stiller! And Joe Pantoliano!
There are some harrowing moments and some moments that legitimately moved me. Even though the Japanese are the enemy, the scene where Bale salutes the Japanese pilot is a powerful scene. Empire of the Sun is one of Spielberg's more ambitious efforts. He may not have completely succeeded, but he still made a movie that captures most of his qualities and gifts as a director. It is also more of a personal story that spoke out to the director. His vision could have been clearer, and the story could have used less meandering, but I do love the effort. I originally despised Bale's performance but the more I think about it, the more I believe it is intentional. It is meant to be to show how big of a transformation he underwent. It still took me out of the movie somewhat though. I can recommend the film even if it is just to marvel at the picture's look and sound.

Boring,"Artistically, this movie is good. But the main thing I remember about it, when I saw it in the theater in 1987 when it came out, was how damn boring it was (to both my parents and to me).I recall this scene of the boy who eats liquor-filled chocolates because there is no food, and then starts riding a bike inside his house. Boring.I remember the John Malkovitch character, the Oriental boy on the other side, various other elements. But even as I write this review, the main feeling that floods me is that memory of how slow and boring this movie was. How did this get a 7.5 star rating?",3.0,Anonymous,History
A must see movie.,"I watched this movie when it first came out in 1987 and I just watched it again I'm 2020. I'm so glad I watched it twice because now I realize what a gem it was. The acting was superb and had so many actors in it I had forgotten about. Some I didn't veven know who they were back then. For example I didn't know the main character was Christian Bale. I just started watching and there he was, such a good young artist. The cinematography was beautiful and the score was so beautiful. I realized that at the time another movie with a similar title took home all of the awards that year, and I suspect many people either forgot about this or never saw it. If you have never seen it then you are in for a treat and if you haven't seen it in a long time it's a good one to remember again. Directed by Steven Spielberg",8.0,Anonymous,History
The story of war through the eyes of a child makes it more poignant,"Christian Bale was amazing in this movie. He started as an obnoxious boy that you really dislike then you watch all the horrors he went through and you watch him grow to a kind young man.From a child's point of view he doesn't care who wins the war, he love airplanes and admire brave pilots. He was so innocent at the beginning believing that his parents will eventually come to him then at the end he lost hope even he forgot how his parents look like.

A visual masterpiece,"A masterpiece of a film. Literally the shots that Spielberg chooses, tells a story without any dialogue needed.Great performances by a very young Christian Bale and John Malkovich, they made a great duo and their chemistry on film is very authentic.Bale's character Jim evolves brilliantly from a spoiled rich kid to a young man that is still kid at heart. His innocence of the world still shows even in a time of war.Every aspect of the movie from the set design, costumes and capturing the time period was met with superb attention to detail.It's a no brainer that this movie received several well deserved Oscar nominations.

Kid's Point of View at War,"Many of the uniqueness of this film. This film has a distinctive story telling way by presenting war stories seen and conveyed by a young child. Not only small children, but I think this film wants to show warfare from the civilian side. All the characters here are also very charming, you will easily like the characters quickly. You will not be surprised why Gareth Bale has been so successful and has totality in his various films as you see him here. Even though he was very young at the time, his acting performance was very powerful and captured the audience's attention very well.This is one of Spielberg's noteworthy works. You can see the editing, backsound, scoring, cinematography, and storytelling are in great harmony and inseparable from one another, what an extraordinary combination. Over all, not only is the technical combination enchanting, but also the story and the beauty of this film itself is already enchanting. You can feel sadness, joy, togetherness, and pain, all in one war-themed film, and things like this are very rare for you to find.

Great movie about wandering when lost,"It's classical Spielberg and that's a great Spielberg. Following a British boy in World War II China who got lost from his family, we embark on an adventure through sadness. Not necessarily the sadness of War, because we don't get to experience its absolute horror but we do get to see the sadness of losing our family, of wandering aimlessly through a dog-eat-dog world and of adulthood catching up with us at a fierce rate. At the same time, it's about retaining that sense of wonder we get while looking at the world through our child-eyes. I believe Steven Spielberg managed to capture this dichotomy quite well, resulting in an uplifting and wonderful film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A sweeping and powerful epic,"Empire of the Sun definitely seems to fly (undeservingly) under the radar. It's perhaps not one of Spielberg's more well known or more widely watched films, yet it has such great appeal and so much to digest, enjoy, and connect to.The real triumph of this film is the spectacular performance from Christian Bale. Surely one of the finest performances from a young actor (that I can recall at any rate), especially given the gravity and emotional elements to this role. This is a coming of age story in the midst of a war and Bale nailed the emotional and mental transformation of young Jamie perfectly.We were treated to a small collection of supporting characters, with the standout being John Malkovich, but in truth they were all second fiddle to Bale's captivating leading performance.The story is exceptional, tracking our protagonist through the duration of the war in the east. We chart his journey from the initial invasion of the Japanese to liberation, through abandoned streets, gruelling POW camps and barren wastelands. It's truly epic in scale, but it always anchored by Bale's Jamie, which keeps the film grounded and constantly injects the human element.As with any Spielberg film you'd expect the direction, cinematography, and score to be on point, and Empire of the Sun is no exception. It looked beautiful, and had some stunning shots. The score was also so powerful, and added extra layers to the emotion and power of the film.My only real criticism would be that the pacing was maybe a little off in parts. The film did feel overly long, never to the point of becoming a chore, but there were times when it nearly strayed that way.A spectacular war epic! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History

Malkovich is also excellent here.Now, the real beauty of this film is that it shows war as it is; there is no real ""good"" side fighting it. Both Americans and Japanese did horrible things, something that other war movies seem to dismiss.The soundtrack is absolutely outstanding. A 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A gem to behold!,"I had never heard of this movie. But after hearing that Steven Spielberg directed it, I wanted to see it immediately. I made a smart choice. This movie is rich in emotion, storytelling, and history because of the author's background. Another truly marvelous thing in this movie is Christian Bale's performance. He breaks your heart as you watch it. It was another one of those movies where I was emotionally devastated when I saw it; it's right up there with ""Rent,"" and ""E.T."" Now, it surprised me when I learned that it didn't do well in theaters because people weren't use to Spielberg's transition into drama. But man! I don't understand how anyone could be disappointed in this. It's an incredible film and it will remain incredible for as long as the world is here to see it.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Irritating Kid Ruins Film,"I love kids - nice, behaved kids but young Christian Bale in here, despite growing up to be a fine actor, plays a character as annoying as hell. He does nothing - at least in the first half of the film - but run around speaking gibberish, making no sense. Then he switches gears totally in the second half. Never is he a realistic kid; almost always is he irritating.Also, a big factor in why this film disappointed me was that it simply was too long, and too melodramatic. I like the photography. I've never seen a Steven Spielberg movie that wasn't eye candy.Another drawback of this film is needlessly confusing. Many people came out of the theater had no clue what this was all about. Some people are always afraid to admit it, so I am glad to see some reviewers here comment honestly on that.I also see too many negative messages from Spielberg films, this being one more example. He likes to show kids being smarter than adults, he's extremely PC-minded, too much so, so ethnic groups are always shown better than Anglos, and cheating and lying are fine for kids and others as long as they help achieve the object. That's in here with Bale's character ""Jamie Graham.""It isn't all bad; there are sincerely touching movies and, for many, profound messages. It has the usual anti-war message. The acting is great all around. John Malkovich, as always, is fun to watch. There is a good mixture of drama, intrigue, wonder and awe as in most Spielberg films.It's just that ""Jamie"" dominates the film, start-to-finish, and most of the time he is a pain in the butt. I'm sorry if I sound like ""Scrooge"" but watching a bratty, obnoxious kid for 2.5 straight hours in not entertainment to me..",4.0,Anonymous,History
LET'S FIGHT 4 A RE-RELEASE,"OK, all you 'pay-check critics' and 'insightful media people'....whether you want to admit it or not....your ----- ummm..""negative comments"" are being thrown back in your face!!! Mr. Ebert, I hope you come to the comment section of this movie one day and realize the mistake you made when talking %&@$ about this flick. Now, about the movie.....1) I've made EVERYone I know so far watch ""Empire of the Sun"". The movie is SO MUCH a part of me that I feel people will understand me better if they watch this movie.2) It's extremely addictive. I can't even COUNT how many times I've seen it... but I ALWAYS CRY during the same certain scenes. Like when the British guy (on the roof) shakes Jim and tells him not to think so much. The way Jim reacts. Sniff! I also cry when Basie tries to take the dead woman's shoes. How 'bout when the Japanese dude can't get his plane to start; his culture thereby branding him a loser?    There's certain scenes-and this is what I feel makes the film truly unique- where you look back and think you should have felt sad, but you didn't. This is intentional; like toward the end, when one of Basie's crew shoots Jim's Japanese friend. This is because Jim has transformed into a more bitter, cold, but even stronger person, so the scene should not be so emotional, as much as a bit hopeful, accepting, but still dreamy(when Jim performs the CPR on his dead friend.)3)What about when Basie wouldn't take Jim w/ him to the airfield camp, the way Jim would do ANYTHING to get in the truck w/him. ""Suzhou?! I know the way! My parents are members of the country club!""4) The ""song"", which I later heard for an Amex card commercial & sung by Charlotte Church on her Cd- Suo Gan- was best sung in this movie (just curious to know if 'teenage Jim's' salute while singing was actually sung by Christian Bale; I already know the choirboy solo in the beginning wasn't sung by him.)5) When I first saw this movie about 12 YEARS AGO(I'm gonna break the trend here, guys), I remember my favorite scene being the American pilot waving to Jim...man, how visually memorable. When I went to see it again, the kid in me connected w/ what the kid in Jim was supposed to connect with(I think):.............I'm not sure how to put it in words, okay, but something glorious. People keep saying things like 'that wonderful actor Bale' was 'just as great ' as a younger kid actor'....Umm...If you ask me, the way he impresses filmmakers (or the honeys) is to pop in his ""empire of the Sun"" tape  and they'd think, ""oh, well this prodigy actor has been asleep between then and now, but we'll give him another chance because we love what he did 13 ys ago"".In short, Bale(though I LOVED Newsies & Swing Kids), will probably NEVER have a better performance than he did in ""Empire.""This is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.",,Anonymous,History
"""Hey kid? You wanna Hershey Bar?""","Empire Of The Sun (1987) -I have always enjoyed this film, even when I was a lot younger and didn't really know what it was about or what my emotions were truly capable of. It will always be heartbreaking to watch and I'm also looking forward to reading the book, although it's sure to upset me as much as the film if not more. I definitely struggled to read 'Schindler's List' and imagine that the book this film was based on will be no different.I'd like to see an extended cut of the film with all of the deleted elements where so many of the actors were chopped out, because I'd love to see the extra richness that should have been included. I believe that it was still as good today as it was in 1987, so a re-released Director's Cut would probably do really well in cinemas.The whole film was lead by a 13 year old
Christian Bale, who was absolutely superb! It was criminal that he didn't even get an Oscar or Bafta nomination. Not only was his performance outstanding for someone of his age, but he literally carried the weight of the whole film throughout.It amazed me that the awards people seemed to be completely blind to this film as it included so many other great performances and the film as a whole was incredibly good. I've never seen 'The Last Emperor' (1987), the film that it lost some awards to, but I can't imagine that it compares to this for me.Nigel Havers also deserved recognition for his role too and I will never be unimpressed by Leslie Phillips, who just seemed so effortless.John Malkovich was genius and horrible at the same time. He reminded me of a scary clown, kind of comedic, but also terrifying.I both love and hate films like this, because they are so brilliant, but it's so upsetting to see the brutality that man is capable of and the greed, dishonesty and selfishness that comes to the fore when faced with our own demise. It turns my stomach how manners and decorum is forgotten in these situations right from the beginning and it's every man/woman/other for themselves.I will never understand violence or aggression or the need for either of them. Nobody should be treated like those depicted in this film. The current Russian attacks towards the Ukraine is a sad testament that the world has learned nothing from the wars suffered in the first half of the last century. With all the advancements we have made, we still haven't found a way to curb these violent and power hungry impulses. It is such a shame to be living in these times, although I'm glad I wasn't around to be interned in a camp like the poor people that don't all make it out shown in this film.The final scene wrenches my heart out every time.

I felt connected to Jamie from the first scene to last and I honestly can't remember the last time I watched a film that had a character I was rooting for as much as I was for Jamie. Also I didn't find out that this was based on a true story until I was about half way through the film and I had a sudden impulse to do a quick google search on the film which made it so much more impactful and impressive.I truly felt like I had found a real gem of a film at the end.It was an emotional rollercoaster all the way through with every single emotion accounted for!

"Dull, Monotonous & Overlong, Empire Of The Sun Is Unsure Of What It Wants To Be.","For a film that brims with such a strong passion for flying, it's quite ironic that Empire of the Sun doesn't even manage to take off at any given point over the course of its runtime. Quite a chore to sit through, this coming-of-age war drama from Steven Spielberg is completely devoid of his usual flair, remains monotonous in tone from start to finish & is pretty much unsure of what it even wants to be.Based on the semi-autobiographical novel of the same name, the story of Empire of the Sun is set during the Second World War in China and tells the story of Jamie; an English kid who after getting separated from his parents during the Japanese invasion of Shanghai ends up in an internment camp where he learns to survive despite the poor conditions & establishes a good living but when the war nears its end, so does his innocence.Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film opens on a fine note by wonderfully introducing all its characters and while there are various indications that the story might pick up anytime now, that moment never really arrives. The whole story feels like a compilation of many episodes sewn together without any clear idea of what Spielberg intends the film to be, plus whatever emotion it was trying to evoke from its audience simply falls flat.Most of the technical aspects are sound in its execution but that part is a default option in a Spielberg feature. Production Design team does a brilliant job in putting up some authentic- looking models & set pieces, Cinematography nicely captures the surroundings & unfolding events but it also lacks the immersive dimension that invites the viewers into the story. And while John Williams delivers an expressive score, it only works in bits n pieces.Editing is disappointing for the story is way longer than it needs to be, isn't properly paced either & its 154 minutes of runtime is severely felt. Also, some sequences that made its way into the final cut should've ended up on the editing room's floor instead. The only thing that saves Empire of the Sun from being a complete disaster is the magnificent performance by Christian Bale in what is his on-screen debut & he's finely supported by John Malkovich.On an overall scale, Empire of the Sun is possibly about the loss of innocence but it travels in so many directions that it ends up halfway on everything it was trying to be. Its motive is unclear whether one approaches it as a coming-of-age story or a war drama. The only good thing about the film is that it brought on screen a promising talent who would later go on to become one of Hollywood's most sought actors but apart from that, Empire of the Sun has nothing interesting to offer.",,Anonymous,History
In This Movie Fan's Top Ten,"Having read others' comments here, I must conclude that some people shouldn't be reviewing movies.This is a magnificent film, with stellar performances by John Malkovich and Christian Bale. I expected the excellent portrayal that we see with Malkovich, but that director Spielberg got such a perfect performance in this debut from twelve-year-old Christian Bale is nothing less than astounding. It is in my opinion the finest performance one could ever expect from a child, and this opinion, of course, speaks both to the acting and to the directing.The film is fair, true, and uplifting. I am not a ""cryer,"" but I cried when the American planes appeared. When Jim was reunited with his parents, I broke down.The horror of war is shown in uncommon ways, not the least of which is the loss of innocence of this child.""Haven't I taught you anything?"" asks Malkovich's character.""Yes,"" Jim replies.

MAGNIFICENT,"This is one of the most overlooked screen gems in cinematic history. By all rights, ""Empire"" should have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards, but inexplicably it was criticized for not being usual Spielberg fantasy fare. I believe that it is this movie, not ""Schindler's List"" that is Spielberg's masterpiece to date. He paints a moving, poignant epic upon a canvas of stunningly beautiful cinematography. Christian Bale pours his heart and soul into a performance that could well be the best ever given by a child actor. As young Jim, separated from his parents, he shows us the gritty, crafty resilience that children can have in dire circumstances. His fear and determination touch us and we admire him, wondering if we, as adults, could cope or adapt as well in the same situation.Too numerous to mention are the scenes which are heart-rending or simply surreal. For me, the essence of this movie is captured in the scene in which Jim scurries to the roof to watch his heroes fly by, and cries in exultation, ""CADILLAC OF THE SKY!...""",10.0,Anonymous,History
THE best movie ever. Period.,"This stunning masterpiece being overlooked proves the sad truth that most moviegoers have been willing to shut off their brains.

This movie contains rich symbolism and other literary devices, and the fact that it is based on a novel make it a must for an English/literature class. History classes can use it too since the film is about WWII. Drama classes must show it to serious students who want to learn a thing or two about acting from Christian Bale (which is beyond words). Film student definitely need to see this movie most of all.The music score by John Williams is outstanding. The acting, especially from Christian Bale, is simply too astounding to explain.

A Young Boy becomes a man in the Master of Film's most uplifting Masterpiece!,"After the unforgettable movie experience of the Color Purple the Master of Film has done it yet again with the most Heartbreaking, Glorious, Soaring, Uplifting, Inspiring and one of the most Unforgettable movie Experiences of my life it really is a soaring uplifting film of the human spirit and an inspiring coming of age adventure you feel uplifted and wonderfully inspired because the way in which the inspiring themes of the film are presented to in the patriotic direction the soaring uplifting score the wonderful redemption at the end when all hope seems to be lost and all hope is rediscovered and redeemed when the dreams and inspirations of Jim's new found life come true all because of a life changing experience of the horrors around him in the harrowing events of war because of one change one memory one moment that could all be slowly fading away really makes Jim wonder if his new found dreams are the right thing to do or does he help and look after the people injured and wounded? The Direction and Score tell the story of the film with the care and affection for the history it portrays it almost feels like a documentary not a film! Like the Color Purple the film has an idea a theme that runs through the whole film the theme of tolerance the idea of what are we prepared to tolerate and suffer in order to achieve the dreams we want the dreams we aspire to achieve the future of all man kind! I really feel strongly about the film as much as I do about the Color Purple they are underrated Masterpieces and do not get talked about any more among the Master of Film's filmography because they have not done well with awards or not gained the critical acclaim they deserve! Empire of the Sun is the Best Picture of 1987 for a number of reasons the inspiring themes of soaring airplanes and the dreams we all share the recurring motifs of memories that Jim has like the haunting melody that his mother plays on the piano similar to Celie and Nettie's hand clapping motif and song in the Color Purple which connects Celie and Nettie together the Haunting piano melody that Jim's Mother plays connects Jim to his mother he knows that he is safe and well and that is very powerful for me that a simple piano motif can bond and connect someone together! The film has a recurring theme of showing acts of malevolent evil and what the power of evil can and will do if necessary there are threats of danger and you see many sequences of danger and hurtful acts of evil which affects Jim and the people around him as the threat of evil increases and the hope decreases as Jim knows he feels anger for the evil around him but he never speaks his emotions the film shows it through the simple power of emotion and Jim's body language he really changes throughout the film he cares and respects all who know him he has a friend called Basie who he aspires to and when Jim explains the emotion of the heartbreaking experiences he has gone through throughout the war which are intertwined with the wonderful experiences of the planes soaring across the sky it feels heartbreaking and wonderfully overwhelming at the same time! Like the Color Purple you feel the overwhelming force of the ending as all hope is restored when the whole atmosphere of the whole world returns to normal no feeling of darkness peril or danger worries Jim at the end he is with his mother he is safe and well but there is a sense of traumatic memories that will never change the heartbreaking sequences of people reviving other people back to life which people should never have to do in the first place but they have to in order to survive the traumatic horrors of war! Last note I want to say that The Color Purple and Empire of the Sun are heartbreaking companion pieces and they need to be loved and appreciated more and we can share the Color Purple and Empire of the Sun with the world!

"A stunning movie, based upon a true story.","Anyone who has read at least a few of the reviews here, will at least know the basis of the story. But it amazes me how few people understand its origins, and how wonderfully it translated in to the movie medium.The story is based upon the life of J. G. Ballard (James... Jim), and the true story of how he became separated from his parents at the sacking of Shanghai, by the Japanese, which formally opened hostilities between Japan and China. Jim's father was essentially a 'tai-pan' of shanghai, the English political men with the money. As the invasion happened, with all of these wealthy people trying to escape, Jim was separated, and proceeded to live out the war off his own wits, and through the prison camps and eventual liberation by the Americans. J. G. Ballard wrote the book as an auto-biographical story of his life, and even with a little bit of (well done) creative license by Spielberg, the story (and more importantly, message) more or less remains the same.This was the second world war, remember? It lasted a long long time, and many many people died, a significant portion of which perished in the prison camps administered by the Japanese. There are a also a number of reviewers here that talk of the similarities to King Rat, as if it is some sort of 'rip-off'. King Rat and Tai-Pan were both written by James Clavell, one of the survivors of Changi, another prison camp administered by the Japanese. The similarities exist because both stories occurred in basically the same environment, as told by some of the people that lived through them.It is Steven Spielbergs best movie. And in his first movie, masterfully directed, and proof that he has always been a great actor, Christian Bale. With John Malkovich as imperious as ever, and so many other fine actors like Nigel Havers, Joe Pantoliano, and Miranda Richardson.It is a beautifully done movie, about a boy on his own, growing up in the most tragic, and yet awe-inspiring of circumstances. And if people can't see the truth in the acting, then it probably has more to do with not believing real-life, even when it's right in front of them.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Unwatchable,"I guess I'm in the minority here but for me this was excruciatingly bad. I had to stop watching after the first half hour and I can sit through practically anything. The invasion of Shanghai was just so fake and every scene so manipulative and clumsy. There is nothing real about this monstrosity. Bertolucci's Last Emperor is the closest thing I can think of as a comparison, but even that waste of money is less condescending and deeper. The simpleton view of the world can be entertaining and obviously comforting to many but I won't get into where that leads. More evidence that Spielberg is truly the Frank Capra of our times, naive and sickly sweet, fine for escapist fare but failing completely to understand anything deeper.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A child's perspective,"I saw this movie when I was perhaps 10 or 11 years old.  It was much too raw for someone of that age.  Watching a child go through this utter stripping away of his identity was too much for a child to really handle.  I sat on the floor of my bedroom in front of a floor-length mirror and stared at myself for an hour afterwards.  It was clear to this young child that there are powers outside the realm of any control.The separation from his parents, from his way of life, eating grubs for protein, nuclear fallout, there things were big, for anyone, let alone someone so small.  I haven't seen it since, and I don't think I want to. Like Eraserhead, I'm not sure what I would think after so much elapsed time. I just remember the sense I had of nothing and everything mattering in this wide-world where things can change in an instant.",,Anonymous,History

One of my top ten films of all time,"I can't remember exactly how old I was when I first saw this movie, but I know I was quite young. It was at an age when my level of maturity was not to the degree that would allow me to appreciate serious dramas. I was still very much into the typical flashy and trashy fanfare most young kids my age liked. EOTS was the first serious movie I ever liked. It just absorbed me from beginning to end. It was utterly beautiful and moving, deeply emotional. It also had a great soundtrack that really complemented the movie. One of my strongest memories of this film is the solo choir bit in the soundtrack (I think it was sung by Christian Bale's character at some point). It was hauntingly beautiful. This is one of the few movies that I have held close to my heart over the years. Even my younger brother loved it and he is seven years younger than I (he was with me when I first saw this movie). It is a real shame that this movie did not get the attention/publicity it deserved (at least not where i'm from). Even up till today I haven't heard anyone mention this film. I'm not even sure it was shown in the local cinemas. Was it ever nominated for any awards? I was too young to remember. It would be  a grave injustice if it wasn't.",10.0,Anonymous,History
See? Spielberg can make a good movie!,"Steven uses a light artistic brush when applying the overwrought music, the special effects and his inimitably scmaltzy style and it works. Probably one of the best movies of the decade by one of the last directors I ever thought I'd expect it from. Most successful sure, but a film of style, insight and gracious humanity? Plus, this is an area of the war that few people have tackled. I'm amazed. This is a film that deserves to be watched again and again. The acting is superb, the characters are superb, and the cinematography is awesome. The fact that two of the most talented actors working today (John Malkovich and Joe Pantalioni) are in this is just icing on an already perfectly baked cake.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Would it be an oxymoron to say:""Vintage Christian Bale""?","Take a bow Christian Bale. It's 1987: Christian Bale meets Steven Spielberg in this ""coming of age"" tale of a young boy, Jim, who is separated from his parents in the course of the Japanese occupation of China, that ended with the Hiroshima-Nagasaki bombings. And how that ""boy"" has come of age; this film is an unlikely metaphor for the life of Christian Bale, who is now one of the finest method actors of his generation. His early success almost saw him quit acting (now why does that not surprise me?); the film garnering six nominations and not surprisingly no wins, thanks to the Spielberg jinx, if such a thing did exist!!In this adaptation of J.G. Ballard's award winning novel, Jim leads a comfortable existence with his parents in a tony white neighborhood in Shanghai, a clique of people who are convinced the war will not touch them. He is fascinated by fighter aircraft, a recurring theme in the film. As the Japanese occupy Shanghai and Jim is separated from his parents, his world abruptly changes from swimming pools and golf clubs to prison camps and scrounging for potatoes. His encounter with the street smart Basie and their interactions form a strong thread to the narrative. Its heartening to see the stellar John Malkovich upstaged by a teenager; two kindred souls who might have otherwise never met, given Jim's privileged upbringing. John Malkovich sneers at being told by Jim how he was ""presented"" to a personage of consequence.Bundled off to a prison camp, young Jim is brave, resourceful and kind, always looking out for the other inmates, making friends with the kindly Dr. Rawlins (Nigel Havers) and Takatoro, a Japanese boy with whom he shares a love for aircraft. The Kamikaze pilots and Jim's fascination with their bravery underscore how he is still a boy; as he refuses to see them as the enemy. The film ends with the blinding flash of Fat-Man & Little-Boy hitting their targets in Japan, which Jim in his innocence assumes to be the soul of Mrs Victor reaching heaven. The incessant scrounging for foods yields to a cornucopia as the Allies airdrop cannisters of food, chocolates and Lucky Strikes. Jim's reunion with his mother is for me one of the defining cinematic moments of Bale's career; he was born for this!This is one of those films with a rather meandering storyline, no strong plot and a fairly tame ending: the kind that has viewers frustrated as being vaguely inconclusive or not dramatic enough, the cinematic equivalent of Van Gogh's ""Still Life with Fruit & Vegetables"" that graces the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"fairly good, but certainly not great","I guess I'm the only person around who didn't really enjoy this movie.  I found it very difficult to like Christian Bale's character, and I don't know why.  The movie itself was too long, and had too many cliches.  I kept waiting for Basie to tussle Jim's hair playfully and say, ""You did good, kid.  You did real good.""  I'd have to say that this is my least favorite Steven Spielberg movie.  It lacked the emotion of ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan,"" exchanging it for melodrama.",5.0,Anonymous,History

One of the Truly Great Films of Our Time,"This film marked Steven Spielberg's first foray into 'serious' film-making. Serious meaning no aliens, man-eating sharks, or whip-wielding men in fedoras. It was also released in December which is prime Oscar season, and though young Christian Bale was not nominated for an Oscar, he really should have been. Several times he completely blew me away. He took Jim Graham through so many different places and was brilliant at all of them. From snot-nosed British brat to Japanese POW survivor, he was brilliant all the way. I only saw about the last twenty minutes of the film about ten years ago and was moved to tears by the end. I saw the entire film last night and was practically bawling by the end.The camera work was a bit of a departure for Spielberg, with a lot of sweeping shots and slow pushes in, but it's all gorgeously done. The most beautiful example of how an amazing performance and great cinematography is a scene near the end when the camera very slowly pushes (almost creeps) in on Bale. It's just great film-making.Bale is the absolute stand out performer in this film, which is good seeing as how he's the main character. It should be no surprise he made it out of the child star mold and became on of the most respected actors of his generation. The much lauded Malkovich is splendid as is British actor Nigel Havers. A young Ben Stiller makes a startling appearance to anyone who's only known him for his more goofy roles (not that he's entirely serious here). Spielberg also broke his own mold and made a great drama with almost no action. It's just an excellent film all around.",10.0,Anonymous,History

The movie tell a story about the adventure of a boy from riches to rags, and from there he evolved from a spoil kid to a survivor.The scenery is amazing, from the city scenery to the dessert scenery, everything is a feast for the eye. The castings are superb, and the plot is stunning. Even with only Christian Bale (some of his solo performances in this movie are really good) and John Malkovich, the movie is very entertaining. The conversation between a child and a crook is always interesting. The plot develop naturally, and I can feel the evolution of the boy, with every experience that he confront.When I first saw the movie, I was still in the same age with ""Jim"", and until now every time the movie is in the program, I tune to the channel.

Closely resembles a work of art,"Bale is excellent(fantastic, amazing, brilliant, shockingly good) in the lead role with strong performances no matter how trivial they are from the rest of the supporting cast. Spielberg works to provide an amazing story here presented in strong emotive colors. The end result is excellence and although the director, yet again, dabbles a bit too far in sentimentality - he can be forgiven as what is produced is a rounded scope on humanity and how that can come through in such hard times. Scenes that resemble paintings of great art include the crowd sequence at the beginning along with the bombing scene and of course the salute. There is also an hilarious cameo from Ben Stiller although I don't think it was meant to be. A great film that is slightly underrated in history and closely resembles a work of art.

A Timeless Classic,"Two of the most powerful performances of my generation were presented in this cinematic masterpiece. Christian Bale's initial blockbuster role could arguably be his best ever. Playing an eight year old boy who becomes lost during the panic of the Japanese attack on Shang Hai in the early years of World War II; through several years of survival in various internment camps until the end of the war. Bale's portrayal of a somewhat ADD afflicted youth was pinnacle to the success of the film. He was astonishing, and anchored the production very well. John Malkovich played the antagonist to the hyperactive child brilliantly and added another very round character to the film. Although the film centers mainly on Jim and Basie, there are some subplots that were included, but could have been developed better. Dr. Rawlins struggle to save his patients and his obvious resistance to his Japanese guardians was not well developed although it was a key event more to develop Jim's character than to present or fulfill the Dr. Rawlins character.The cinematography of Empire of the Sun was stunning. The party scene of Jim playing with his glider and finding the downed Zero. Then subsequently ""discovering"" the Japanese soldiers was very well done. The Shang Hai city scenario was stunning in it's panorama and detail. The fade in to Jim obviously older and wiser in the internment camp, with him running around still the hyperactive child at the beginning, meeting everyone exchanging and bartering. The dogfight scenes with the P-51 Mustangs, and Jim yelling, ""the Cadillac of the skies!!"" and him running back and forth on the roof; to the final scenes of the prisoners march north, and Jim seeing Mrs. Victor's soul flying into heaven (the bomb being dropped on Nagasaki). These all contributed to an absolutely riveting film experience.The only part of the film that I can truly say is overdone is when the Japanes pilot gets shot, and Jim tries to resuscitate him. I really was ready for him to stop yelling after the fifth or sixth repetition of his line. The film was neither anticlimactic nor was it an overly happy ending. Jim finally is reunited with his parents, yet the scars of surviving basically on his own are forever impressed in his eyes. A scene that I will always remember.",10.0,Anonymous,History
So bad it almost made me cry,"I think very highly of Mr Spielberg. After having seen Schindlers List and Saving Private Ryan (and many more films by him), I expected Empire of the Sun to be a rather safe choice.Well, I absolutely couldn't stand watching more than 30 minutes of this abomination of a movie. I admit that not having seen all of it may seem to make my opinion less valid, but let me add that this is the first time ever I have been so disgusted and annoyed by any movie. I am usually very forgiving and don't mind a flawed film if it has some redeeming qualities. But this... Every single line of dialog and every bit of acting made me cringe. The main character, an incredibly dumb, mean and arrogant kid is by far the most annoying character I have ever seen. And yes, I have seen Jar Jar Binks. I stopped watching when I found myself thinking that even if the remaining two hours of the film would be scenes of this kid being tortured, it wouldn't make up for what was done to me in the first 30 minutes.",1.0,Anonymous,History
"Decidedly on my ""100 Favorite"" list.","They don't make movies this great anymore, or at least, I haven't seen any such lately. It is an epic, as I think it was meant to be, but the director achieved more, perhaps than he thought.  The credit belongs chiefly to the young actor, Christian Bale, whose career,I confess, I have not followed, but who, among a well selected cast, not the least of whom are John Malkovich and Miranda Richardson (anyone ever seen a BAD movie that John Malkovich was in?)are the pivotal players, and truly make the film.  An incredible support cast does a great effort, and succedes in a flawless line of action. [Did you notice Ben Stiller? He's in there for a small part, but, of course, done well. Remember the old line, ""there are no small parts; only small actors""? This gives one a look at a ""small part"" for a future great actor. From the first time I saw this film, in the '80's, I have been haunted by the music [John Williams] and the performances, especially of the child actor.  I greatly disagree with a previous reviewer that this is in any way a David Lean wannabe film.  In fact, I believe it is truly unique, even for Spielberg, and all connected with the film.  I am a member of this era and everything from the mannerisms to the hairstyles are so very correct.  The only thing I ever noticed was that the silver dollar (used as a golf chip and later found by ""Jamie"" in the pool) seemed to be anachronistic, but I may be wrong.  I have watched many times, and perhaps my eyes are not as good as they once were. This most assuredly stays on my ""100 Favorite"" list, and heartily do I advise those who know not of this history to view it.  I am buying a copy for my grandchildren's library.  It is not only a good film, it is an important film, about which I can say that few make the list.  If you view and are interested by this film, I suggest that you read and view ""The Good Earth"", written by Pearl S. Buck.  Even now, with all the digital properties of movies, the special effects are remarkable, and the acting, characterization is superb.  It gives the viewers a background on China in pre-WWII times, from the view of the Chinese peasants. In any case, I suspect that ""Empire of The Sun"" will grow in it's ability to attract viewers, and in a most engaging manner.  It is difficult to view this film with emotional detachment, especially for one who remembers WWII, or for anyone who was once a child.",,Anonymous,History

Absolutely one of Spielbergs best,"Underrated is right. This film has so been ignored when discussing truly great films and certainly the films of Spielberg. This film came out the same year as Bertolucci's ""The Last Emperor"", and was buried under the buzz of that film. Too bad, because Spielberg achieved what Bertolucci could not: Encase and convey a highly personal story within the context of particularly turbulent historical events. The experiences of Spielbergs ""Jim"" are felt more deeply than those of Bertolucci's Pu Yi. Both films are visually stunning, and on an epic scale. But these qualities tend to overshadow the human story of Last Emperor, and this is a human tragedy of epic scale! It is about China's last monarch, the last of a line dating back thousands of years. It is about the extinction of a species. Pu Yi is the last Mohican, so to speak, the last dinosaur. And yet, the deep, personal sadness of this doesn't come through anywhere near as profoundly as the broad and deep emotions of the boy Jim living through Japanese internment in Spielberg's Empire of the Sun. We get underneath Jims's skin, and ride the emotional roller- coaster that is his life. Conversely, we watch Pu Yi, often with the level of understanding one might have watching an animal in a zoo. We may feel some pity at it's captivity, but then we see it fed and housed and calm, and we figure, ""Well, I guess it's not that bad."" And of course there is this: Empire of the Sun makes me cry every damn time I watch it.",10.0,Anonymous,History

"A moving, outstanding and excellent masterpiece","Well, I've to say that I didn't expect much when I decided to watch that film. Another too long story that won't give you anything. But man, I was impressed. I've seen many films in my life, but nevertheless, this one ranks among my personal top-favourites. Spielberg has done a tremendous and simply excellent kind of work with producing this movie. The story is brilliant and the setting is great. Besides, Christian Bale shows one of the most impressive and finest portrayals of a character I've ever seen, he's acting as if he knew which feelings and emotions this boy has deep inside. I really wonder why this unique work by Mr. Bale didn't receive an academy award. Since Jimmy Stewart playing George Bailey in ""It's a Wonderful Life"", no character was played so intensive and convincing like young Jim. The scene where the boy is standing and singing together with the Japanese pilots, and the following scene when he stands on that building seeing this plane passing by belong to the most outstanding movie-sequences I've ever seen.

Now, 'Empire Of The Sun' is no-way a bad film from this legendary storyteller, but surely is way below his margin.

Chinese Blood Is Worth,"I have some reminiscences about China and Chinese, but let's first talk about the film. I browsed a long list of some 100 movies on this topic and decided to choose 3 titles - merited because are produced and directed by American European staff, shot on location in China and based historically on true stories. That makes a difficult combination, especially having in mind how little do we, white people, know about Chinese National Psychology during 3000 years of China history and culture. So have the list:1. Empire of the Sun (1987) - about a lost English boy in Japanese occupied Shanghai during WW II;2. 55 Days at Peking (1963) - about the Boxer rebellion in 1900. Earliest big budget Hollywood movie shot in China, I presume;3. Last Emperor (1987) - about the end of Manchu Dynasty in China and ensuing National Democratic Revolution. I guess, film 1 & film 3 were intentionally produced in one and same year to counterpoise directors Spielberg versus Bertolucci.Seemingly, Chinese cinema devoid of it's martial arts status subsequently lacks much artistic value. Or at least this is my opinion as non-Muslim, non-Communist white spectator. For instance, John Lone and Joan Chen may look different in perspective of the Asiatics because of peculiar outlook (eyes are not slanted and skulls do not protrude) but nevertheless they remain Chinese if estimated by European and American referees. So Yellow Race does exist in the looking glass - how old and culturally viable is matter of United Nations to debate. Period.I am not an ""old cock hanging on its dungs"" (anonymous citation). Most of the white people seldom had contacts with Asiatic races, per se. Here in the Balkan countries of Eastern Europe we have few representatives of the Far East. Unlike former Soviet Union, which is Slavic and Orthodox like us, most East Europeans are not acquainted with Asiatic mentality. We have long traditions with dealing the Muslim population of Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan). They are good Muslims, with Asiatic faces and no Jihadist inclinations, whatsoever. Thank You!",10.0,Anonymous,History

Example: The sequence when Jim enters his mothers room and its empty, except for the powder on the floor. And trough the prints in the powder Spielberg tell us what Jim think has happened to his mother and when Jim can`t handle this he opens the window and all the prints in the powder is erased. Pure genius. The entire picture is filled with these moments of Pure Film and that is what makes it such a good movie.",,Anonymous,History
Another great film from the greatest director.,"SPielberg is the best, his films are some of the best, this is no exception. The story covers a different side of WW2, but is just as interesting. The performances, sometimes alittle bit over the top, are mostly good, especially the young Bale, who probably did his best work. There's action, drama, humor, and adventure, no too much of anything, but still is off balance a tad, its long but feels somewhat thrown together. Besides a lack balance, and a sense of confusion, the film is great, and very entertaining. The PG rating doesn't make sense either, no kid is gonna sit through this and understand it, and between the groping and the depictions of dogfights and sickness, i think this merits a PG 13, and more realistic and graphic depictions of these events would make the film much more dramatic, even though it already is, it would be better if we thought the kid had a harder time. Anywho, its Spielberg, its great, you shouldn't expect anything less, 8 out of a 10, a few minor flaws don't change the fact that overall he is the master of film, he has proved that more then anyone else, don't even try to argue, if you do, your wrong.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Materpiece!,"If The Doors was Oliver Stone's baby, then Empire of the Sun is Spielberg's. This is his signature piece, if not his masterpiece: from the airplanes to the rolling dolly shots to the film stock quality, Empire of the Sun reflects all that is great about Spielberg's craftsmanship as a film maker without the bombast and over-sentimentality. The scale of the film is enormous, the production values incomparable. You can feel that no effort was spared to recreate the world recorded in J.G. Ballard's novel--from the crowds of Shanghai to the concentration camps, the Kafkaesque compound of confiscated goods in a vast open field in China, parachutes containing rations dropping from the sky: every scene is perfectly realized. Even Kubrick could not have done better. The atomic bomb blast sequence is hauntingly realistic and ominous. Who can forget that scene when Jim tries to retrieve his glider and sees a line of Japanese aviators on a hill in the distance, taking up the entire movie frame? The lighting of the sky, the ominous mood--pure cinematic genius. This is also one of Spielberg's most subtle films in terms of characterization--Christian Bale is superb as is John Malkevich--both convey how individuals cope with the horrors of war with acceptance and pragmatism. I have to say that this film is superior to both Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List as an organic work of art, as well an archetypal story for all nations. I am not a big fan of Spielberg, but Empire of the Sun gets my vote as his masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,History

my favourite film,"I first saw this film back in 1987 when my parents took me to the theatre. I was five at the time, but the movie was something that held me tightly and would not let go. I guess it was Jim living on his own that fascinated me. I've never been on my own, but I always wondered what it was like, I was a child, my life revolved around kindergarten and episodes of Mister Rodgers Neighborhood. When ""Empire"" premiered on HBO a year later, I had my older brother record it for me. I watched it everyday and wore out the VCR. Ten years later I saw the film again, not as a little kid, but as a fifteen year old girl planning to be a movie director when I grew up. I catapulted into the story and relived many childhood memories as Jim ""ran around trying to find his parents,""(that what I always thought it was about for ten years), I read the novel by J. G. Ballard and found all the symbolism Mr. Spielberg had put into it. It has always been my favourite film and has been since '87, as I watch the movie(at least once a week now) I see the five year old little girl that I once was. Steven Spielberg took us into to the life of a young British boy in a Japanese interment camp outside of Shanghai, China. Jim meets Frank and Basie after being ""lost in the crowd"" and becomes a pickpocket for Basie's constant errands. Four years later, as the war winds down, Jim questions a lot of things in his reality and can't remember what his parents look like. He doesn't want to leave the camp, but he wants to find his parents. This movie is my favourite film(I bet you're sick of hearing that!) and it should have won all six Oscars it was nominated for and more(including Best Picture). It's a cinematic achievement, one of Spielberg's best, and will live forever in movie history if people will watch it and admire it story and characters.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Painful Coming-of-Age Story,"A tough film about the cruelty of war and the death of innocence, ""Empire Of The Sun"" seems dedicated to a single point, that Stephen Spielberg can make a serious film. Unfortunately, ""serious"" is not the same as ""good.""It's December, 1941. Young Jamie Graham enjoys a life of privilege in western-controlled Shanghai, China. Those good times are about to end, thanks to the very same Japanese war machine Jamie idolizes. After the tanks roll in, he is separated from his parents and forced to fend for his own in a bleak landscape.Based on the real-life experiences of author J. G. Ballard, ""Empire Of The Sun"" is a story about human suffering above all. Another review here, more positive, describes it as ""a small story told on a vast canvas,"" and that captures it for me, too. It's a painterly film, with vivid imagery abounding. In that way, Spielberg often channels the director originally slated to make this, David Lean. That said, I found myself thoroughly alienated from the people and situations involved.Christian Bale is a stunning actor, able at 12 to deliver the kind of performance as Jamie that raps you on the head like a two-by-four. But he's a handful. Either he's talking a mile a minute or staring off into space in some kind of feral transport. He's also really obnoxious and unlikable. This is noticed by some of the other characters, too.""You're starting to get on my nerves,"" says an American scrounger he runs into in Shanghai, Frank (Joe Pantoliano).""Very difficult boy,"" is the verdict of Sgt. Nagata (Masat√¥ Ibu), commander of the internment camp where Jamie is sent.My favorite is the response given by fellow prisoner Mrs. Victor (Miranda Richardson), when Jamie asks why the Japanese closed the schools: ""To punish their parents.""You have to find things to entertain you watching ""Empire Of The Sun,"" since this is one time Spielberg won't do that for you. Like Jamie, or Jim as it becomes later, this is serious business all the way through, with starvation and disease gnawing at your elbows and hardly any hope in sight. Don't look for a bright light here; it just may be an atomic explosion.""First one side feeds you, the other side tries to get you killed, then it's all turned around,"" Jim is told by his sometime buddy Basie (John Malkovich). ""It's all timing.""Malkovich is in great form, as movie-star ready as he ever looked on screen, and to solid effect, but I never got his purpose here. He doesn't bond with Jim, nor figure much in the outcome. No one does; Jim just wanders around until the scene shifts, after long languors, to something else.There's a desperate need here to trim, especially in the beginning and the end, but Spielberg and screenwriter Tom Stoppard are more concerned with Big Moment Cinema. We watch Jim serenade kamikaze pilots with a schoolboy chorale, and a minute later he's cheering their deaths at the top of his lungs, chanting ""P-51! Cadillac of the skies!"" If Spielberg can't engage you, he'll overwhelm you trying.Spielberg has gone on to make other serious movies, and to my mind, done so more successfully even if his tendency to overpush remains. You see moments here that remind you how good he is at scene-setting, but if I said I cared for five straight minutes watching ""Empire Of The Sun,"" I'd be lying.",3.0,Anonymous,History

Steven Spielberg has done great in this movie!,"This movie was great!Steven Spielberg has done a magnificent job in directing and Christian Bale did absolutely wonderful with acting out his character, so did John Malkovich. The cinematography was also really great in this movie. I like how this movie's story is put along true events. I think that this is probably one of my favorite movies that have been directed by Steven Spielberg! Everything about this movie was great. I also thought it was great how the boy was so interested in air planes, and while the Japanese were ready to leave in the planes, he just started singing. Also when he went up to the plane, and then gave a salute to the pilots. One of my favorite shots was when the boy (Jamie, Jim) was riding through the house on his bicycle. Another one of my favorite shots in this movie was when, Jim was watching a plane go by, and just as this happened they showed him at this view that was absolutely magnificent. This was a great movie. Steven Spielberg has made a great success!!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Spielberg's Unsung Masterpiece,"Naive, slow, maudlin, superficial.  These are the criticisms typically leveled at this film.  Coming after ""The Color Purple"", it was regarded as another overly sentimental attempt by the director to take on ""serious"" subject matter.  Critics may be easily enough dismissed, but I read somewhere that no less a figure than the great Japanese director Akira Kurosawa sent Spielberg a letter taking him to task for ""Empire of the Sun"". Perhaps he took offense at the way the Japanese were portrayed in the film. I'd be very curious to know exactly what his criticism were, but I imagine the thrust of it was that Spielberg's Disney-ish world-view was inappropriate in the context of a serious and important subject such as WWII.Spielberg seemed to have taken these criticisms to heart, because when he came back to WWII again, he approached it in a radically different way. ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" give us a window into the era that is painfully transparent.  Our collective knowledge of this time comes from newsreel footage and the recollections of those that lived through it. Spielberg drew on these elements and created two films of striking verisimilitude.Now that Spielberg has his Oscar and no one accuses of him of being incapable with ""serious stuff"", I think is now possible to fully appreciate ""Empire of the Sun"".This is not just a stepping-stone to his later, ""truly mature"" films, but a great work in its own right - one that in my mind forms an integral and compelling WWII trilogy with ""Schindler"" and ""Ryan"".Whereas the later films take a profound and unblinking look at the horrors of the death camps and the battlefields, I think in many ways ""Empire"" actually goes a little deeper.  WWII was not just an epic, global human experience, but a transforming moment in history.  1945 wasn't just the year WWII ended - it was the end of an era.  It clearly marked all that followed as a new and modern age (both exciting and dangerous).There is nostalgia about WWII.  I think this nostalgia runs deep for a very simple reason.  With WWII, the events of Auschwitz and Hiroshima, the world became a place whose end was no longer just hypothetical, but very possible. ""Empire of the Sun"" is a film that expresses this wider sociological impact of the war quite tellingly.For Americans, however, nostalgia for WWII isn't just a yearning for a simpler, less dangerous time.  Maybe this is why Spielberg's intent with ""Empire"" was largely lost on his American audiences.  WWII brought the nation together in powerful ways and catapulted it onto the center of the world stage.  America was victorious, after all.  If Americans have a perception of those times as Big-Band fun and GI Joe heroics, Hollywood has certainly played a big part in forming it.  If any filmmaker is especially attuned to this fact, it is Spielberg.  His earlier ""1941"" was a reasonably (though not entirely) successful attempt to pay tribute and parody the Hollywood wartime propaganda that we've all grown up with.""Empire"", through its unique story, allows WWII to be viewed from different and vital perspectives.  The protagonist, Jim (brilliantly played by Christian Bale) is not the typical Spielberg ""gee-whiz"" kid, in spite of any superficial similarities; but a precocious, sheltered, rebelliously minded son of an English ex-patriot living in the Far East.  He likes to read GI Joe comics, but he also is an atheist, and writes books on contract bridge.The Americans in ""Empire of the Sun"" (splendidly personified by John Malkovich through his character Basie) aren't stereotypes either.  Behind the ""Joe Cool"" sunglasses and ""Hi'ya, pal"" facades are calculating opportunists.  Even the antagonists, the Japanese, are not depicted simply as ""Bonzai"" fanatics; we are allowed to see them as committed and courageous warriors too.""Empire of the Sun"" is a great story about the loss of innocence, not just that of a spoilt English choir boy, but of the collective innocence of the world.  It may lack the subtlety of ""Summer of '42"" or the wistful charm of ""Hope and Glory"", but ""Empire of Sun"" shows us a WWII that isn't just grim horror and tragedy, isn't John Wayne guts and glory either - but an ironic mixture of both, which characterizes the subject pretty accurately I think.If any moment in the film best shows the strength of Spielberg's effort here, it must be the moment where the terrified Jim is lost, racing through the war-torn streets of Shanghai.  He's separated from his parents, pursued by a dangerous ruffian - and comes upon a gigantic mural of ""Gone with the Wind"".  It is one of those blatant but compelling cinematic images, like Orson Welles pontificating before an enormous backdrop of Charles Foster Kane.This is one of many great moments in a stirring and thought-provoking film, moments I won't soon forget:Jim chasing his glider up a hill only to come upon a company of Japanese troops preparing to invade his world...Jim signaling a Japanese destroyer with his flashlight and getting an explosive response...Jim snatching a food dish from the grip of a dead prisoner...A lost boy in a lost world finding his heroes where he can (saluting Japanese airmen)...His surrogate mother dies in his arms as the world enters the nuclear age... (Subtle symbolism may be more aesthetically pleasing, but it is not always so effective)The euphoria of liberation, the hysteria of civilians caught in the deadly crossfire of war... (The Mustang air attack sequence - a splendid example of Spielberg's filmmaking craft as any!)Jim, a listless refugee, casting away his suitcase, letting go of all that used to define him and give him certainty...Jim frantically trying to resuscitate his Japanese alter-ego...Spielberg has always been very conscious of the cinematic legacy he has inherited.  Kurosawa may have hated it, but I can't imagine that David Lean wouldn't have admired this film as much as I do.",10.0,Anonymous,History

great film,"With Empire of the Sun, Steven Spielberg transformed into cinema the dark vision of the world and its future of the novelist,  J. G. Ballard.  Of course credit should also be given to brilliant scriptwriter Tom Stoppard, but in this film, Spielberg presents a story of a traumatized British boy's shifting identity as ""empires"" shred, with power shifting from Britain in China to Japan, then to the nuclear terror ""empire of the sun"" of the newly-harnessed atomic weaponry of the United States.  But by all three of its `authors,' this story of ideological shifting is as much about the world at war as about the boy Jim's separation from and longing for his parents -- to whom does this lost boy belong?  Jim is struggling to know who he is, and how to function in a world where arbitrary and shifting power becomes the only absolute.  Jim needs a nurturing mother and a legitimately authoritative father.  The story of Empire is the story of Jim's struggling search, and our search with him, for a sense of belonging in a world where violent power has become absolute. The two words, ""ideology"" and ""identity"" share much common meaning. Because he is struggling to grow up -- coming of age -- at the same time as he is separated from his parents in war, Jim is struggling to find an identity.  Ordinarily, one knows what is ""the same"" with one's own values by means of a symbol-system, or ideology.  But Jim's values and emerging identity are bombarded by the collapse of such systems, and he must first struggle to survive, physically and spiritually.  Through the eyes and the mind and heart of Jim, the novel's author, J. G. Ballard, presents an autobiographical narrative of his own experiences in Shanghai and Japanese internment camps in China.  Ultimately, at the end of the film, it is questionable whether or not Jim has been able to integrate his experiences with suffering and death when we look into his empty, traumatized eyes. He is found by his parents, and is being embraced by his mother, but we do not know his future. In his young world of fantasy where might is right and beautiful, Jim dreams of airplanes -- symbols, fetishes and talismans, the ultimate incarnations of power.  For Jim they are dreamlike, exalted objects of worship.  Jim is a boy who is deeply enamored with the new technologies of war.  His every day- and night-time dream is filled with visions of the newest warplanes and their dogfights and bombing raids.  So, increasingly, he binds himself to the imagery of death technology in American media.  He grows to love their violence.   Jim's problem with his identity, with his sense of  to whom and to what set of values he belongs, is represented to us with this fascination of his with airplanes.  He tries to compensate his missing and lost family love with his love for planes and flying.  In one scene when Jim and the displaced Europeans are brought into a camp to help build an airport runway, Jim sees a Japanese Zero being worked on in a hanger.  He slowly approaches and lovingly caresses it while choral music builds, and a surreal background of soft lighting, light from welders' torches, smoke and golden sparks from grinders presents us with another seemingly supernatural scene. Three Japanese pilots approach the plane, and when Jim sees them, he slowly comes to reverent military attention, and he and the Japanese exchange salutes. Planes not only substitute for his parents.  In one scene, when American planes bomb and strafe the airfield, Jim shouts hysterically, ""I touched them!  I felt their heat!  I could taste them in my mouth!  Oil and cordite!""  We know that Jim is deprived of parents, and we also know of the importance of food symbols and the motif of  starvation in the film.  But this is the first time that Jim's seeking, and finding, of nurturing from the airplane is made explicit.  His friend and, to some degree, father substitute, Dr. Ransome rushes up onto the roof where Jim is running and shouting crazily and tells him to ""Get down!"" and ""Stop thinking so much!"" Jim weeps, telling the doctor that he can't remember what his parents look like, then goes into a trance-like state, and chants his Latin lessons which he has been working on with Dr. Ransome, but with the words: ""Amatus sum,"" I am loved. In the novel, Jim witnessed American planes shot down, and the pilots unable to eject, and burning alive in their seats.  As with the kamikaze pilots, these pilots are just part of the weaponry machinery.  They cannot separate.  The order of this war-time structure means that even Jim himself also has no individual human worth apart from the military machine.  Ideas of individual coherence or integrity have less and less meaning as the war, and Jim's experience of being lost within it, continue. ""Despite everything, he knew he was worth nothing.""  The deaths of the pilots were ""a premonition of his death, the sight of his soul joining the larger soul of the dying world.""  His cheerful American friends in the camp turn out in the end only to be other servants of death.  When he learns of the new weapon, the atomic bomb, Jim knows that they also are not only destroyers of human bodies, but also of distinct, autonomous selfhood. Basie tells Jim that since he has seen the bomb, he might appear in Life. Up until the point of the dropping of the bomb and his experience of Mrs. Victor's ascent, all Jim's actions lead in the direction of fulfilling his obligations to death in war.   Since only as an object of death can he be fully known and ""loved"", Jim is only perfected in his weakness and submission to the machinery of death.   At the end of the war, after the atomic weapon has been used, has the fighting really ended?  Jim becomes aware, with the killing of his kamikaze friend that he has entered a world where there could be no leaving behind the horror of war, where war has become total. In a scene reminiscent of the hospital attempted revival, an American has stupidly shot dead Jim's young kamikaze friend  just as the Japanese boy had given Jim a mango and they were about to share it, providing Jim with a little of the nurturing he so desperately needs and desires.  Jim is shocked and outraged by the stupid, wanton killing.  The night before this attempted magical revival scene, Jim had just witnessed the explosion of the atomic bomb, immediately after a mother substitute, Mrs. Victor, had died in his arms.  In that scene, Jim at first believed that the strange new light across the sky was Mrs. Victor's soul going to heaven. When Jim hears the report of the bomb on the radio, his identity is once again shattered. Jim now no longer worships the god of death and destruction, the airplane.  He believes that he now possesses the power of the sun, and is an almighty healer.  Believing his hands to possess supernatural powers after having witnessed the power of the sun, having seen the light from the explosion of the atomic bomb, Jim applies the same heart massage to the just-killed Japanese boy, while chanting, ""I can bring them back.  Everyone.""  As he moves forward and down massaging the chest of his shot friend, the light of the sun glares into the camera lens, then clears as Jim moves back up. This glare pattern, alternating with Jim, repeats many times.  We then see a shot of the body Jim is giving the heart massage to, and it has become the younger schoolboy Jim who has been left behind years earlier.  A few moments later, we see that it really is still the Japanese boy Jim is trying to revive, but blood oozes from his mouth with each press on his stopped heart. The young kamikaze pilot, with whom he shared model planes, and who protected him during his near-suicidal pheasant-hunt, in many ways represented Jim's confusing Japanese identity -- his double.  But he is very dead. Although heavy, this is great, meaning potentially classic, film-making.",,Anonymous,History
One of the most underrated films in history,"This would have to be one of the most underrated films in cinema history. I find it to be one the few films that makes me get a lump in my throat, the John Williams score is one of his best, and Christian Bale proved that he was an immense talent from this (his debut) a difficult part for any actor, let alone an inexperienced ten year old. Furthermore the film is quite un-spielberg like in that it lacks the sentimentality of a lot of his other work (read: the terrible Terminal & the overrated E.T).

Then John Malkovich happensMany WWII movies focus on what happened in Europe and it's refreshing to indulge in an entirely different struggle as a backdrop. Christian Bale's performance is amazing, I had no idea til now that this was the same guy who gets cast in evil roles in such films as 'Shaft' and 'American Pyscho'. What really holds weight with this movie is the camera shots, some of the best Spielberg ever directed. Much of the movie relies on unspoken scenes which really gives the audience a break from mouthy actors distracting you from the overall concept.Bottom Line: This is a good rainy day movie, it is not jam packed with action, though the action scenes are quite moving.

"Beautiful to look at, but you'll need the patience of a saint to endure it","Empire of the Sun focuses on the life of Jim Graham (Christian Bale) who is a privileged young boy living with his wealthy family in Shanghai. Jim ends up being separated from his parents during the outbreak of war and ends up under the wing of Basie (John Malkovich) and his friend Frank Demarest (Joe Pantoliano). Soon after Jim meets Basie and Demarest, they all end up being captured and forced to spend a considerable amount of time in a Japanese POW camp.For me, there were a lot of problems with this film but I think I'll get the major problem out of the way first; it's so boring!!! There seemed to be long scenes that went on forever and went nowhere - even though the film was 2 and a half hours long I found that nothing really happened - it wasn't interesting, entertaining, tense, exciting. It wasn't even particularly moving which is an effect Spielberg can normally pull off in his sleep.The next problem was that the film suffered from very thin characterisation; none of the characters were developed, the friendship between Basie & Jim wasn't explored very well. Jim also becomes friends with a Japanese POW camp soldier which could have been interesting, but again wasn't developed to its full potential. I literally found myself bored, having nothing and no-one to care about. I'm not exaggerating when I say that it was a chore to sit through this dull film.The final problem with this film lay with Bale's character; his almost constant whining and shouting ended up getting on my wick for the majority of the running time. He becomes less irritating towards the end, but I still found his character too much for the most part.There were a couple of positives and the most obvious positive is the Cinematography; it was absolutely beautiful and almost made up for the dreadful screenplay. I also quite liked Jim's gradual transformation as the film progressed. However, these elements alone aren't enough to save this film which to me was an over-long, dull and tedious film that almost put me to sleep.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Christian Bale is brilliant.,"8 out of 10Empire of the Sun is a powerful drama that tells the story of young James Ballard (Christian Bale), a British child who was trapped in WWII China as the Japanese quickly took power.  This is probably among Steven Spielberg's least well-known works, probably because of its box office failure and lukewarm critical response, but it's one of his better ones (which says a lot) and definitely his most underrated film to date.Spielberg's direction is typically first-rate; most of the film's quality actually hinges on Christian Bale's performance, and thank God he doesn't disappoint.  As a matter of fact, his riveting turn is the strongest display of acting I've ever seen from a child performer (yes, even better than the supremely talented Haley Joel Osment).  With Bale at the center, what could have been a lousy WWII drama is instead an emotionally effective and quite uplifting tale that never fails to grip you from beginning to end.  A definite must see for drama fans.",,Anonymous,History
Either my favorite or second favorite movie of all time,"I just thought I'd add my two cents, after all, commenting on this movie is half the reason I registered.  I also saw this movie 10 years ago, and just recently re-discovered it, and I'd say I've watched it around 23 times now in the past week.  I absolutely love this film and make everyone I know watch it.  The actors are magnificent, and although I feel it sometimes lacks an emotional punch (keyword there being sometimes), the storyline is excellent.  I personally love Japan and have a lot of respect for them, and this gave me a good insight to one aspect of the war.  This is a great movie and everyone should see it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
stunning view of life in war,"The absolute beauty of this film unrivals anything else I've ever seen. People have often viewed it as one of Spielberg's ho-hum adventures, ranking somewhere between Jaws and Schindler's List but it is far more insightful than that. The agony and terror of young Jim slowly turns him into a young man when in the POW camp. So many aspects of this film are visually stunning and emotionally devastating, such as the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, the P-51 attack on the airfield and the death of Jim's young Japanese would be kamakazi pilot. When I saw Saving Private Ryan, the first thing that struck me when the P-51 ripped the Tiger tank apart was Empire of the Sun. Its view of a savage war through a boy's eyes can't be described, it's just absolutely stunning.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Brilliant story of a boy's growth through extreme circumstances,"Empire of the Sun is one of those films that I will make anyone, that is close to me, watch.It's the brilliant story of a spoiled little boy who, through tragedy, war and loss learns to survive and in turn, to grow up.It is so rare that a film combines a brilliant story with unbelievable acting and outstanding direction.  Everything from the use of light, which Speilberg is a master at, to the scenery within a Japanese prison camp is exquisite.Christian Bale (as a child) and John Malkovich are both brilliant and you can see why their careers have gone so far from this mid-80's film.In closing, this is one of about a dozen films that I have seen in my life that has made me cry.

Difficult subject to get right,"It's not a great movie, and I am not sure the material ever could be. I think the problem is that it is trying to be an epic, and yet these episodes were minor facets of a much larger and more appalling history.

My aunt was in Shanghai at the time. She was evacuated on a hospital ship and exchanged for Japanese citizens. My father in law was a POW. My father fought in Burma. The father of a good friend was in a POW camp near Hiroshima when the bomb went off. The experience of all of them was so awful that it is difficult to see this movie as of significant interest.

Exquisitely beautiful movie,"I first saw Empire of the Sun as a teenager and loved it then. I recently watched it again and had much more appreciation for it.

I love this song and actually discovered that it is a Welsh Lullaby.FAV 2 -My other favourite scene is when Jim tells the very sick Mrs. Victor to pretend she is dead. Which they both do to avoid having to continue on with the other prisoners. Jim wakes up and tries to wake Mrs. Victor, but she is dead. Then a brilliant light fills the sky and Jim thinks it was Mrs. Victor's soul going to heaven when in actual fact what he saw was the bombing of Hiroshima.FAV 3 -Now that I am a mother, I found the last scene very emotional. All the mothers and fathers looking at a crowd of children desperately hoping to see their childs face.

I enjoyed this movie,"Being fascinated by the WWII Pacific front, as well as by the British century of Asian colonial rule, I enjoyed this romanced historical drama about a boy weaving his way through the nightmare of Japanese occupation of China and its foreign concessions, with military aviation in the backdrop. I find great worth in the childish point of view--actually bordering on puberty--used to tell the story here, as one is thus better seated into the skin of the protagonist. I find the often human depiction of the Japanese refreshing and representative of historical reality: I assume many of them believed in their God-given mission to rid the East of the foreign exploiters and take their place as masters of Asia and the Pacific, long live the Emperor! Never mind Manichean good-guy/bad-guy dichotomy: Wounded Knee, Mi Lai, Abu Ghraib, and Guantanomo Bay should be enough to convince us that war is an ugly, messy, amoral affair, no matter who started, who wins, and who History places in the Right. Regarding this picture, I identified with the interned foreigners and was left reflecting on how anyone, even the most privileged and educated today, can be brought to wrestle for a ration and ""kill for a potato"".

Magnificent Masterpiece,"I saw this movie as a child. And almost 20 years later, it's still my favorite. I was drawn to watch the movie because of the beautiful music and the stunning cinematography. But the movie goes even beyond that. It is a story about a young British boy who survives a brutal Japanese concentration camp through his innocence, energy and enthusiasm. For me, it wasn't a story about a war. It was about how an adversity will not destroy a strong human spirit. While everyone else is succumbing to the brutalities of WWII, the young boy never loses his purity and enthusiasm for life and people. He is trusting, loyal, optimistic and brave. And his Japanese counterpart (the young kamikaze) shows this as well. Two young boys become friends, even though they should be enemies because they do not know hate, greed and cynicism that people develop as they get older. The best thing about the movie was Christian Bale's acting - amazing what expressiveness such a young actor can have (he is also amazing in American Psycho and The Machinist).

Ignorance is Bliss,"Steven Spielberg is a funny guy.

Hey, Mass Murder of Women and Children is great, if it means that this poor little American kid finally gets something to eat. How arrogant can you get, really? This film illustrates nicely why American movies are every so often of little interest to anyone outside of America, especially if they deal with international themes. Never ever occurs it to anyone involved that there is probably a view apart from that of the western world, and so the whole complexity of the Chinese/Japanese war is reduced to how much fun our jolly British fellow has in the Prisoners Camp.

It is so simple and so strong, filled with sad and tough moments experienced by those people. The change of looks that Cristian Bale's character suffers is amazing, from wealthy boy to a boy who has nothing, to win or to lose. The sound track is so sad and beautiful at the same time.

Wartime captivity from a young boy's perspective.,"Hollywood's treatment of the Japanese in World War Two movies is always harsh, maybe deservedly so. According to many published histories, the Japanese treated American and other Allied POWs with cruelty bordering on outright barbarism. Incidents, such as the infamous Bataan Death March, are cited as examples of Japanese cruelty. Yet this movie attempts to portray the Japanese in a more balanced and less stereotypical way. True, in this movie too, there are scenes of Japanese beating POWs and forcing the POWs to live in conditions of abject squalor, but to the young boy in the movie, he perceives the Japanese differently. He sincerely respects the Japanese, for their dedication, tenacity, and discipline and in response the Japanese come to respect him too. The movie shows how the young boy went so far as to learn some Japanese, my point being that this movie succeeds in offering a far more sympathetic portrayal of the Japanese than found in other movies of this genre. I'm sure that some POWs who had to endure months and even years of captivity under the Japanese may object to such a portrayal, with valid grounds for feeling that way. Nevertheless, this movie is worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,History

"""Cadillac of the Sky!""","Truly a ""Cadillac"" among films. It is nice to see history finally catching up to the greatness of this film, which rarely takes a false step. The middle is perhaps a bit muddled and long, but it all serves an eventual purpose. And so many have misunderstood the angle Spielberg takes---the view of war through the eyes of the little boy. This gives the director the freedom to see things in fantastical terms without being considered overly ""Hollywood"" or corny. The mainstream press just winced at the slow-motion glory of Christian Bale jumping up and yelling ""B-52, Cadillac of the sky!"" as planes roared overhead. But---the scenes were magnificently filmed, and they captured the boy's preservation of his own child-like nature despite what he had endured. ""Empire of the Sun"" has endured years labeled as a ""minor"" Spielberg film. But I believe this is a film to carry over into the next century, and treasure anew.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Empire?  Which one?,"Great Britain's ""nickname"" historically was the empire upon which the sun never sets. This was due to their far-reaching imperialist nature. The film even begins with a history lesson / scene setting exposition which illustrates how Shanghai was basically a British colony, indistinguishable from England in terms of its buildings and infrastructure. Hong Kong was still under British rule until the end of the last century.So, when another reviewer, NeuroticMovieLover, describes this film as one showing the destruction caused by a nation that wanted to control everything, I must ask, which nation would THAT be? Fascism was rampant around the world, highly fashionable with those in power at that time. Business leaders in the United States bristled at the notion that Germany was not a trustworthy ally, even as they began to conquer Europe. It was only because American business interests were threatened by fascist expansion that the U.S. entered the war against the ""Axis of evil"". We were just the other side of the same imperialist coin. Our overlords were better at selling servitude as freedom than the SS, Mussolini's black shirts or the Hirohito cult of personality.This film was very good at portraying people from every quarter as being as flawed as they were noble.

a fine wine,"Empire of the Sun is one of those movies that, if you are not paying attention, can be bitter or harsh after sampling.  I compare the movie to a fine wine--it gets better with age.When I first saw Empire of the Sun after it was released, I had mixed emotions leaving the theater.  To me, the story seemed to flow flawlessly until the release of the prisoners from the prison camp.  Then the story seemed to get muddled and confused, not knowing at the time that this is what Steven Spielberg was wanting to accomplish.  For many years, I had a love-hate relationship with the movie; there were so many things I liked, but so many things I would have liked to have seen differently.But Empire of the Sun is one of those movies that does get better with age. When I first saw the movie, I still pictured Spielberg's movies in a common theme--action-adventure (Jaws, Close Encounters, E.T., and the Indiana Jones movies).  I kept this love-hate relationship with this movie until Spielberg started producing his more serious work (Schindler's List, Amistad and Saving Private Ryan).  I now realize the genius that was Empire of the Sun, and I bet if the movie critics had a second look at this movie now, they would realize that this movie belongs on the short list of Spielberg's best movies.  I am now proud to call it one of my favorite movies.It is one of the most beautifully-filmed movies I have ever seen.  Perhaps the reason this is Spielberg's most misunderstood movies is that the master storyteller lets the film and the music tell the story, and not necessarily by use of dialogue.  While John Williams will be remembered for the musical scores of other Spielberg films (Jaws, Close Encounters, Raiders of the Lost Ark, even Schindler's List), this is truly John William's masterpiece that, in my opinion, even he has yet to top.  Its as if Spielberg commissioned the music first, then filmed around the music.  What is not said in the film is just as important as what is said.Christian Bale gives the performance of a lifetime as Jim, the young boy who is separated from his parents after the Japanese take Shanghai during World War II, and the stories of his struggle for survival in a prison camp until the end of the war.  To this day, I am still shocked that a 13-year-old could give such a commanding performance, acting toe-to-toe with the likes of John Malkovich, Nigel Havers and Miranda Richardson.The story intentionally gets muddled about two-thirds of the way through the movie.  But as the allied forces slowly inch their way to China, things are naturally going to get confusing, when the only goal of the characters is survival.  This is one of those movies that you learn from each time you see it, until finally you learn enough to understand that this is exactly what Spielberg had in mind when he made this movie.If you have not seen the film, or if you haven't seen it in a long time, I encourage you to rent the movie and enjoy it all over again.  I could go on talking forever, but in summary, I believe that this years from now that Empire of the Sun will go down as one of Spielberg's best films. Enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,History

But why wasn't it a box-office success?  Easy. No warm, fuzzy storyline, no squinting bad guys-- even the Japanese are given glimpses of being human. I think Spielberg should be thanked for indulging in art and not just another money-maker.

Spielbeg's Best Film,"Despite being one of his few commercial failures (right up there with Amistad and 1942), ""Empire of the Sun"" is in my opinion, his most fully realized work. Based on the autobiographical story of J.G. Ballard (Crash), Spielberg weaves a fascinating story of the fall of China during WWII and the effect it had on the psyche of the ruling British class.  Although there are a number of memorable scenes during the film, three stand out as truly outstanding: an early scene in which the young boy (played without any cloying sentimentality by Christian Bale) weaves through the hectic, riot filled streets in his father's limousine; the scene which depicts his ingenuity in the detention facility; and most memorably, the scene of the American liberation in which he climbs to the top of the building and waves at a beloved fighter plane as it passes by in slow motion.  I would also recommend the soundtrack by John Williams which is rather understated for him and includes Chinese folksongs being sung by an English boys' choir...breathtaking.

Allen Daviau's photography is gorgeous ( I wish he and Spielberg would team up again).  John William's score is at times hauntingly delicate and at other times soaring and grandiose.

Perhaps the best child acting performance ever.,"I have been in awe of Haley Joel Osment for a few years now. However, I think I have finally seen a child actor outperform him. Christian Bale was nothing short of flawless in ""Empire Of The Sun"". In a different actor's hands, this film wouldn't have been nearly as moving and special. However, Bale displays more talent than most seasoned Hollywood actors.As you probably know, ""Empire Of The Sun"" is about a young British boy who becomes separated from his parents during WWII and ends up in an internment camp. Being a Spielberg film, the direction and cinematography are, of course, stunning. Great effort was put into making this film appear realistic and it works wonderfully. In fact, this was the first major American film shot in China.Another strong point of this movie is that it is shown through the eyes of a child. Often, war movies are all too harsh, violent and depressing. ""Empire Of The Sun"" successfully shows us glimpses of the brutalness of war but it also allows us to keep a constant feeling of hope and determination. That is in no small part due to the talent of Bale. He makes the viewer feel what he feels. There is an amazing amount of passion in his performance.It's a shame that this is one of Spielberg's least respected efforts.

Empire of the Sun (1987),"Directed by Steven Spielberg. Starring Christian Bale, John Malkovich, Joe Pantoliano, Nigel Havers, Miranda Richardson, Leslie Phillips, Masat√¥ Ibu, Rupert Frazer, Emily Richard, Ben Stiller, Peter Gale, Paul McGann, Robert Stephens, Takatar√¥ Kataoka, Burt Kwuok. (PG)Adaptation of J. G. Ballard's semi-autobiographical novel about his experiences during World War II. Spoiled, airplane-obsessed British lad (Bale) lives a pampered, sheltered life in Shanghai, but when the Japanese invade, he gets separated from his parents and has to survive many hardships, first on the streets and then in an internment camp. An ambitious epic, but one without much focus or a clear statement; the first hour is often effective, but the movie drags during the more muddled final hour. Despite a good performance, Bale's character doesn't garner much sympathy even as he overcomes the expected coming-of-age and loss-of-innocence hurdles. Even more emotionally distant than Spielberg's previous stab at ""big, serious filmmaking"" (""The Color Purple""), it's an extraordinary true story given a rather ordinary treatment in all ways but the professional polish. At the very least, this is a magnificent looking film with fine period detail, but it's sometimes wasted; like John Williams' heavy-handed score, if the movie had earned its stirring grandeur, Allen Daviau's beautiful photography would have served a greater purpose. Although a familiar cynical-but-resourceful type in POW/prison movies (think: William Holden in ""Stalag 17""), Malkovich's characterization is the most diverting.52/100",5.0,Anonymous,History

Or, in other words, the scenes that are supposed to be dramatic are ruined by Bale's ""smart aleck"" character, who seemed to be in the verge of stopping the war. The director ""spielbergizes"" or ""infantilizes"" the serious subject matter of the movie, and thus the result is cartoonish at times.And by the way, in that scene where Bale follows a truck full of refugees...I thought for a moment the bike was going to fly or something, lol.

One of my favorites films.,"It's a Spielberg but it's not a typical Spielberg. The movie has great texture, dialog, acting, and character development. It's truly an underrated film. It's one of those movies where you feel immersed in the settings and you feel like you're actually watching the original story unfold for the first time. There is some great cinematography in the film too, especially if you're a nut for WWII fighter planes.While I highly recommend it, the grim mood of the movie won't appeal to everyone.Very highly recommended. From a historical perspective it's also interesting to see the very much documented WWII from a new angle. Based on a true story. Enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,History

"Pointless, long, unlikable, and confusing","I would definitely recommend that those interested in watching skip this film.Spielbergs' film imagines a grim colonial Shanghai, full of selfish and antagonistic individuals whose sinister traits are only exacerbated by the onset of war. I'm a history student and watched this for a paper I was writing over film in the British Empire. This film was long, meandering, and aimless. I have absolutely no idea what it was trying to say. Jim is an extremely annoying and privileged upper-class child of British colonists. I understand in part that this is meant to illustrate that he is extremely sheltered, but he fails to become more endearing as the film progresses, even as he gains more real-world experience.Which brings me to my next point; no one in this film is likable. Basie is extraordinarily arrogant and rude, his affection for Jim feels entirely conditional, his dialogue feels anachronistic (lots of cheesy 80s cool guy one-liners), and his character ultimately feels pointless. The doctor and other characters who act as paternal figures for Jim are all cowardly or self-serving, or both. This is perhaps to portray how people become self-serving in times of war or disaster (which isn't supported by evidence; in times of disaster people are more pro-social), but it just makes everyone in the film unlikable and gives viewers no one to root for. Jim's parents are pretentious, underdeveloped, and it feels as if they have only the slightest affection for him.The depiction of Chinese and Japanese people has not aged well, either. The Chinese characters in this film are depicted as ingratiating, subservient, or antagonistic toward the British. The Japanese (with the exception of one teenage boy who perhaps serves as an analogue to Jim) are depicted as bloodthirsty and uncompassionate warriors. While they were fascists who committed a number of war crimes during WW2, I still think their overall cruelty played up within this film.This film felt like it was 30 or 45 minutes too long. There seemed to be no clear thesis or unifying purpose to the film. It's not even especially valuable historically, it mostly focuses on Jim's individual perceptions and experiences with war, but never seems to drive home a defined point about how war affects children or how they experience it, other than Jim acting downright irrational and bizarre towards the end.",2.0,Anonymous,History
So good it's scary,"This movie is, without question, an absolute masterpiece. It is literally so good that some scenes transport you into the mind of Jamie/Jim in another time and place. I simply cannot say enough good about this film. Christian Bale was simply magnificent. If you have not seen this movie, or haven't for some time, go and watch it. You will be moved like films rarely do. It is easily in my top 5 movies of all time. This is a 'must see' movie. My vote 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
It's About Time,"When I first rented and watched Empire of the Sun on video about 10 years ago, I was so moved by the performances and the story that I: first, went out and bought the video so I could watch it again and again; and, second, moved the movie into my top-ten all-time favorite list.   Christian Bale (who will be hardput to exceed his acting accomplishment in Empire in the 60-odd years he has ahead of him as an actor) and Steven Spielberg (one of a kind) combined to give an extraordinarily rich picture of an awful and devastating war through the eyes of a maturing, but still quite young, boy. So it was disappointing, though perhaps not unexpected, that the conventional wisdom of the time dismissed Spielberg's work here as rather shallow;  afterall, the critics had been predisposed to think of Spielberg in that way.  Silly of them. It is only in the light of Schindler and Private Ryan that critics have begun to appreciate Spielberg's insight, vision, and directorial skills.  Now the critics are beginning to look back at works like Empire to find the seeds of these more recent films. Bull to the seeds!  Empire of the Sun stands on its own, not as a film that possesses seeds for other more ""mature"" works, but as a brilliant film in and of itself -- a brilliance that reviewers were too blind and too prejudiced to recognize at the time (and they PAY these people).  Shame on them!  And great for us! Spielberg, we know, has done tremendous work with Schindler's List, Amistad, and Saving Private Ryan.  These are all exceptional films.  But his truly pioneering work, and the film that ought to be his signature work, is Empire of the Sun. It is still a movie I will watch again and again, and it remains safely and securely among my top-ten -- the critics be damned (though their quest for forgiveness and redemption has not gone unnoticed)!",9.0,Anonymous,History

The acting in this movie is top notch along with some of today's biggest stars before they were stars.The story is heart-breaking but also full of laughter and adventure. The friendship between Christian Bale's character and Malkovich's is odd yet understandable.

Spielberg goes east,"This is a cinematic production in the pure style of Spielberg, which, despite incorporating all the typical visual and narrative resources that the director usually employs, falls just short of being considered a masterpiece. It is a very good film, with great visual and narrative power, but it doesn't reach the dramatic level that the director has achieved with other movies of a similar theme, such as ""Schindler's List,"" or the war film caliber of ""Saving Private Ryan"" or the series ""Band of Brothers,"" in which Spielberg served only as a producer.Perhaps, it is not correct to compare films solely based on sharing the same theme, and it would be better to compare it with the level achieved in ""E. T.,"" with which it undoubtedly shares a more evident affinity. In ""E. T.,"" the protagonist benefits from Spielberg's ability to create a universally resonant and emotionally charged story. The stylistic choices in ""E. T."" serve to enhance the thematic elements of the film, fostering a deep connection with the audience.In contrast, ""Empire of the Sun"" addresses weighty themes such as war and human resilience. Although the film is undoubtedly well-crafted and visually impactful, it lacks the universal accessibility and enduring appeal of ""E. T."" The serious and historical nature of ""Empire of the Sun"" limits its overall appeal, making it a powerful and commendable film within its niche but without achieving the same overall emotional impact as Spielberg's more family-oriented works.With that clarified, and considering that the film doesn't surpass the boundaries of its genre, or rather genres, which include World War II war, life in prisoner-of-war camps, or the more generic theme of the loss of innocence, then the lineup of films to compare with is quite extensive, with true masterpieces, not least the ones already mentioned and directed by Spielberg himself.I would like to conclude with a note about the flaws present in the film, particularly those related to military techniques and means. It surprises me how a director like Spielberg, known for his attention to detail and extensive knowledge of military matters, includes scenes in his films with low-altitude bombings, something highly discouraged due to the shockwave, or even more surprisingly, obstacles placed backward on the beaches of Normandy in ""Saving Private Ryan,"" just to cite a couple of examples. Perhaps it's a nod to the poetics of imperfection, who knows.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Even great people have a dud on occasion,"A British boy (Christian Bale) living with his wealthy parents in Shanghai is separated from them when Japanese forces invade in the early years of WW2. He then has to survive the war in a POW camp. John Malkovich, Miranda Richardson, Nigel Havers and Joe Pantoliano play fellow prisoners.Based on J.G. Ballard's semi-autobiographical novel, ""Empire of the Sun"" (1987) was Steven Spielberg's first venture into 'meaningful' filmmaking. It's not without historical interest. For instance, the beginning situation in China is compelling, highlighted by a potent 'slap' scene that wakes the pompous kid up to reality.From there, though, the movie becomes a tedious prison camp flick with too many ambiguities and drawn-out scenes. Bale does an admirable job in a challenging role, especially considering his age, but IMHO he overdoes it and so the boy comes off hyperactive and annoying. Check out the low-key indie ""I Am David"" (2003) for a more effective take on similar material.The film runs 2 hours, 33 minutes and was shot in China, England and Spain (you can fairly easily figure out which parts were shot where).GRADE: C/C-",4.0,Anonymous,History

"Good Movie, worth a peak.","Before seeing this movie, I had virtually no idea what the movie was about, the only thing I knew was that it took place during world war 2, the 1940's.The story was pretty interesting and did a good job of keeping my interest. I liked all the acting, and I liked the bulk of the characters.  I couldn't figure out why this kid, Jim (Christian Bale), kept going back and hanging out with Basie (John Malkovich) when he just screwed him over left and right.There really isn't a whole lot I can say about this film other than it was an alright film, but it wasn't anything terribly moving or earth-shattering. Also, the film is a little too long for me.  It was good, but long.  So, if you're thinking about watching it, make sure you've got 2.5 hours to spare.All in all, it was worth my time, and pretty interesting.  It's always cool to see the early work of famous actors/directors.

"briliant narrative of war through child's eyes, flawless","I've heard and actually read once that this is one of the most underrated films in history.  I almost wish it would have been released after Schindler's List and Pvt. Ryan because only now does it seem Speilberg is being given the credit he deserves.  I remember seeing this film as a child and relating to it so well, I almost felt as though I was in the film (pardon the melodrama and cliche).  I've rarely seen a film that could portray so honestly the perspective of a child in such harsh times as this film, and Christian Bale's performance is one of the best ever by a child. This film starts off so beautifully, I once read that the first half was the best Speilberg has ever done.  The writer said, however, that the film seems to fall apart at the end.  I think that it is beautiful how the film starts to be erratic at the end which wonderfully emulates what Jim is experiencing.  The only film I watched years ago and today still cry at.The scene where the P-51 pilot waves to Jim right before he realizes he has forgotten what his parents look like is possibly the greatest scene I have ever seen in a film.  The ending is as touching as cinema can get.",10.0,Anonymous,History

WWII epic story of survival and hope.,"An often overlooked story from Speilberg of a young boy and the theme of survival. This film is well worth the cost and the Blu Ray version I bought looked and sounded gorgeous on a big wide TV. For me my favorite aspect of the film was the cinematography the use of colour throughout. In the grimy smoggy city of Shanghai which is on the brink of disaster a peaceful retreat is found for the hyperactive boy ...in the company of his charming handsome parents and their huge home, complete with local servants too. The absurdity of the contrast is underlined when the rich westerns attend a fancy dress party dressed up in colourful costumes, en route they drive past thousands of weary desperate Chinese peasants and refugees with nothing but the rags on their body for possessions. The wealthy entitled boy's world falls apart though when in the chaos of the invasion he is separated from his parents and must learn to become a survivor, the boy is intelligent though inexperienced and manages to stay alive and is reunited with his fellow countrymen in a Japanese intermittent camp, here the music and cinematography pauses for a moment on the image of Jim face to face with his boyhood obsession, a real fighter plane. From his new home, new allies and enemies emerge, there's a real sense of community, even in such places as prison camps, Brits, Americans, a hospital where he encounters a father like figure and the brutal guards all make up this strange and unforgiving environment. Jim all the while maturing, retains his innocence unlike the world-weary cynical adults around him.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Memory and Innocence,"At the most superficial level, this movie is everything Spielberg is typically thought to be: masterful, but a little cold and too perfect and unreal and simplistic -- but still more entertaining than most in spite of all that.Watch a little closer, pay a little more attention, and you realize that this movie isn't that at all. The story happens to be about an English boy in a Japanese internment camp during World War II. But the real subject is memory and experience. It is a true masterpiece, although, like many great works of art, it can trick you by seeming to be straightforward when it is really somewhat subversive. Wrapped up in the Spielberg packaging, the movie hides itself from you if you take it at face value.And that face value is, as I said, just fine if that's what you are looking for.

This is war but all characters remain detached from reality and that is quite something for a director with Spielberg's track record.

Sentimental direction spoils Ballard's surreal masterpiece,"I watched this film when it came out as a child and enjoyed it. However, it doesn't stand up to rewatching in the 21st century due to the level of mawkish sentimentality - just how many times can Spielberg fall back on that cringe-inducing ""character-slowly-salutes-another-character"" device in one film? I think it happens FIVE times in this movie. It is perhaps the laziest and most nauseating device (at least to non-American audiences), and to use it so repeatedly in one film is unbelievable. 
Bale was undoubtedly a precocious talent but you can almost see the direction here, as if you can hear in EVERY scene Spielberg's voice ""Ok, now look around the room in wonder, now take a step forward, now put out your arms, now turn around"". It all seems so hilariously wooden, at one point I thought a chair and table were doing the best acting in the room.

However, other aspects of this film are succesful like its cast: with John Malkovich expectedly being probably the best thing about it.

Also, through out the movie, you can clearly notice messy cuts between different takes of the same scene with some questionable movie editing.From my understanding, the story is told (shown) from the boys perspective but it still fails to display a world of childish curiosity and rather introduces us to not so fascinating and uninspiring plot.And the last thing that bugs me is the title. Empire of the Sun, also known as Imperial Japan, doesn't really have a major role in the movie and the movie is not about the empire.

No more than what it is,"I reviewed the reviews. We all slam on critics for their obsessive broad stroking of films.  Yet I see much of that here.  The movie is more of a human charactor study than anything else.  Many slam the movie for not making a big issue of their particular perspective of wartime China.  But look closer at what is happening in the film.You start with a kid that is spoiled.  Yes he gets slapped by his house person.  Given the implied behavior of the kid, I'd slap him too.  But let the story progress from there.Take a spoiled kid and toss him into a new reality.  One that is unprotected.  He must now deal with every day using the behaviors as he only knows how.  So to some, many of his reactions may seem abstract or hard to follow.  Lets face it, kids do not see the world as adults do.  And reality is pretty tough to understand for them at times. But as time goes on, the kid is broken down more in to a child seeking survival.To look at this movie expecting political comment is unfair.  A child does not see the world in a political way.  As the film travels on, we see how a child must try and figue out just what is real,what is going on, where is safety, where is the security(of family) and adapt. This movie shows how easy it is for a young mind to get lost in all of the changes of the world around him.  I do not see any indication in the film that ""Jim"" aligns himself with anyone or cause.  What he see's in the Japanese boy in the camp is simply another boy.  (The contrast and clash of their pasts and destinies are interesting).The exposure ""Jim"" is given to the confused World during wartime is real. In the end, we do not see him as the matured man of the world.  We see a worn out spent individual that is simply human and survided.If you go into this movie without trying to politisize or over complicate it, you will find it quite enjoyable.  Go looking for a political statement or docu-drama, and you will not like it.",,Anonymous,History
Christian Bale shines as a young boy retaining his childhood in a very grown- up world.,"As  a Christian Bale fan, I went into this movie fully expecting to see the grown up sort-of Bale that I have enjoyed in his more recent films. I instead saw him as an equally amazing child actor, richly deserving of the recognition he got for his performance. A Steven Spielberg film is an amazing stage for a rising actor, and Bale showed that he had talent worthy of such a prestigious movie. And since, Bale has not faded as many child actors, but built a career based on many complex and diverse characters.

His talent was very convincing.  The realism of the movie was awesome.  I really liked the scene where Jim is hugging the Zero and the POW camp officer is about to shoot him, when three Zero pilots walk up and see the boy in a state of awe at the plane.  The boy then turns to the pilots and salutes them--- and then the pilots stand at attention and salute back.  That is awesome!  I watched the movie twice and I know that I will have to buy it now.  It is truly one of my top five movies!  Great Job for Spielberg!",,Anonymous,History
Detached Portraiture,"""Empire of the Sun"" is a hallmark in Spielberg's career. The film is the story of an 11 year old boy who is separated from his wealthy parents with whom he is living in Shanghai at the outbreak of WWII... when Japan invades China.Spielberg's camera is detached... we see what happens to the boy during his three year Odyssey into prison camps, betrayals, deep friendship, deprivations and insanity, but while Spielberg shows us all the physical details, he gives us no emotion: we are left to put ourselves in the characters' situation and interpret for ourselves how these people are feeling - or not feeling. The subtleties of expression are underplayed and add to the underlying tension of the film.The cinematography is stunning - sweeping landscapes and crisp interiors. It seems that the entire film was show with a very small aperture - every detail is sharp and clean. This adds to the surreal elements of the film - stumbling through a rice paddy in the midst of a seemingly endless plain when, suddenly, brightly colored parachutes fall from the sky in the background.The interiors of the prison camp - a bombed out train station which the prisoners have transformed (by slave labor) into a Kamakazi airfield, dirty, dusty, aird - the interiors teem with uncountable small items, screens patched with photographs, eating utensils, sunglasses and military gear... the accoutrement of deprivation and despair. By contrast, a stadium overflows with crystal chandeliers, deco statues, French furniture and a white grand piano... spoils of war.The film is ultimately an haunting depiction of a young boy's courage and suffering in the face of the chaos and splendor of war - a film made by a director at the point of coming fully into his genius.Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,History
Visually Stunning,"I first saw ""Empire of the Sun"" in 10th grade as part of our curriculum for World War II.  That was the first film I cried as I watched it. Spielberg's awe inspiring style which continues throughout each of his films is clearly seen here.  From the clean, British home which young Jim grows up in, to the Soo Chow Internment Camp where he comes of age shows the  surreal nature of many scenes in this film.  A film which has many great parts has one stunning facet.  John Williams' great score which is amoung his best(Star Wars, Superman, Saving Private Ryan) shows the whole spectrum, from the Welsh hymns to the Asian inspired music was incredible.  The best scene in the movie features the Hiroshima atomic destruction.  What more can you say than Spielberg's genius.",,Anonymous,History
personal favorite...,"this is by far and away my most favorite film of all time....the seeds of SL and SPR are planted in this masterfully crafted tale of innocence lost during war....much more thought provoking than Platoon, which covers the same ground.... This is spielberg's first real masterpiece!!!!!",,Anonymous,History
very touching,"This movie certainly stands out. Even for those who'd think of it too corny, though I wouldn't bet on finding too many, the music alone pushes this film right onto a wall of fame. I have always thought strongly that is it music even more than camera tricks that make a movie worth watching and entertaining. This movie proves my believe firmly. I am sure I'm not the only one who gets thrown nearly to tears by the time the kid finds his parents at the end, and won't even recognize them for all the time and hardships he went through, while in the background a very pretty song is played, one the boy himself sings in the beginning. That is the true mastery of Steven Spielberg, that is what makes him one of, if not the best filmmaker of our time. Aside from Spielberg's accreditations, the boy chosen for this movie was very on-track and fitting tightly to the role. He had brilliantly succeeded in making himself look as pathetic and helpless as he could get, but never losing the glimpse of hope in his eyes. Every scene, I believe, was portrayed in the boy exactly how it was meant in the movie.The only thing I slightly regret about this project is not being completely filled in on the history. I still haven't completely understood why the whole story happened, why Japan (I believe) was being invaded. I know how bad I know history, but I know there are thousands more like me who depend on movies like this one to learn. In the end, I recommend this movie to everyone, period. Spielberg has his unique ability of making a movie attractive to all kinds of viewers. It has a little of everything and never fails to entertain, no matter how quiet or corny it gets.",,Anonymous,History
Christian Bale,"I haven't prepared anything, but had to throw in a word for Christian Bale. Granted, as with any Spielberg film, the ultimate star of the film is Spielberg.  (And all films should have that kind of star!)  But Christian Bale's performance is a bloody miracle.  He is in virtually every shot of the film, and he is consistently fascinating.  I pull out ""Empire"" when I need a good cry.  If I'm in a hurry, I fast-forward to, first, the camp liberation scene (""B-52!! Cadillac of the skies!!!"") -- that gets me started -- and then to the final scene.  The shot of him slowly recognizing his parents is astonishing.  Why this performance has gone relatively unlauded is beyond me.  I defy actors three or four times his age to carry a film with the deftness and artistry Christian Bale does ""Empire of the Sun"".",,Anonymous,History
P-51 Mustang Madness !!!!,"I always like this movie score,visual,and acting all of spielbergs movies one way or another has the P-51 mustang saving the day at first I thought it was a fluke but then i see it again in Pvt.Ryan then I saw a docu-on Spielberg and what do you know his father was a pilot in WW2 so now I see the conection well nuff said.. great movie worth the 2.30 hr to see it..",,Anonymous,History
universal understanding,"This movie touched me in a way that few movies ever have. Although ""Empire"" contains a great deal of artistry and imagery I feel that I can only fully express that at base this movie is about the innocence of children and the ties that are formed regardless of race or nationality before they are exposed to the hatred that adults force on them. Jim's journey is a long and complicated one but his innocent friendships with people like basie and the other camp victims show that he is unaware of his dangerous surroundings. This theme culminates with his befriending the young Japanese boy. The two form a bond even though there respective countries are at war with each other. Speilberg shows that only if we look at war as children can we ever hope to avoid it.",,Anonymous,History
War time tragedy,"World war 2 movie always made us sad and felt lucky in a different way.The movie 'Empire of the Sun' really gave us some lesson about how horrible a war is.The survival of a lonely young English boy in China showed the world about bravery and high spirits is all about.""You might cry after watching this movie, But there`s always something to cheer about""",,Anonymous,History
The Greatest Movie,"This was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It takes you on a roller coaster ride. That movie was great, and it made me really think about life in general and how much all this stuff i have is worthless. I saw it because i wanted to see the airplane fight, but i was very moved about how this young boy changes from a spoiled brat, to an amazing good kid who can learn how to cheat the system, and get away with it. The movie was very deep, and is currently my favorite movie ever.",,Anonymous,History
Brilliance sold short,"What was the Academy thinking in 1988? Had it a little more sense and foresight, Steven Spielberg's 'Empire of the Sun' should have swept the table clean of awards.It is one of few productions in the history of cinema that uses the backdrop of war to create a meaningful and impacting work of cinema art. And, at least in my opinion, far exceeds 'All Quiet on the Western Front' and 'Saving Private Ryan' , (but does fall short of the impact of Schindler's List)If you enjoy Cinema Arts, then 'Empire of the Sun' is part of the very basic core of great Cinema and a must see; a early Spielberg Masterpiece.",,Anonymous,History
Beautiful illustration of the conflict between loyalty and survival,"A magnificent movie this is, indeed.  But I don't agree at all that it is about war -- the war serves only as a backdrop to the interaction between Jim, his hero Basie, and his surrogate parents Mr. and Mrs. Victor. Precocious yet innocent Jim picks up quickly on lessons from ""the university of life"" and is seduced by the exciting but survivalist ways of the American GI.  Ultimately the glamourous illusion is shattered by betrayal, and Jim learns the meaning of true loyalty and care when Mr. and Mrs. Victor take him back as their own child.  Jim grows out of his naivety when he sees through Basie's final attempt to seduce him (by offering to take him to his parents), yet he retains his charming innocence with a polite ""Yes please, Basie"" when offered a Hershey Bar (for real).  In the end, what is this movie really about?  The tragedy of a lost childhood.",,Anonymous,History
an unsung speilberg classic,"one of speilbergs truly great directorial masterpeices i found it quiet slow burning until the last half of the film (the P.O.W camp) but non the less i was gripped all the way the visual spectacle of it was amazing and the final 5 minutes brings a lump to even the most hardened movie watcher's throat the only film that i feel remotley comes near in genre and spirit is that mad italians, life is beatiful also entertaining but in my opinion a lot less heart than empire a nine out of ten for me and a well recommended film if you have'nt seen it yet. free from cgi story telling @ its best",,Anonymous,History
A beautiful film.,"This film is one of Spielberg's best. Again, he does an amazing thing by telling us a touching story, through the eyes of a child. That's why sometimes people say Spielberg is in some way still a child himself. But I think this is brilliant, because ""Empire of the Sun"" wouldn't have been the same if it weren't for this amazing child. Christian Bale is magnificent playing Jim, A spoiled yet charming 12 year old British boy living in China with his wealthy family. When Japan attacks, he - through the tragedy of the war - turns from a child to a man.This movie brilliantly teaches us about the horrors of the war (and especially THAT war who has reached and hurt so many people all over the world). And what is more horrifying than the suffery of a child?The music in the film is breath-taking (by John William of course), the directing is perfect. Almost every scene has deep meanings and is loaded with metaphors. You can't help falling in love with Jim - he actually represents the many children who had lived a happy normal happy life.. until...watch this film, and keep a huge pile of tissues in reach!",,Anonymous,History
"Ah, your comments are driving me nuts...","Yes... It was 2 hours and 20 minuets Yes... It was a melodrama Yes... It does drag at times.But these are the kind of movies I love. I, as all people should, love epics with a very dramatic feel to them (I'm talking to you, critics who love to overanalyze.).Although not perfect, I would have to give it AT LEAST an 8/10.  Very good.P.S. William's score is magnificent",,Anonymous,History
One of the best movies to date,"The first time I saw the movie Empire Of The Sun,I have to admit parts of the film shocked me and even now as I have gotten older I still find myself turning away from the part where Jim's Japanese friend is shot and killed. But movies about disturbing events in history ought to shock us if they have been executed well by the direction and the actors in the film. Everyone worked well together to create a breathtaking and often amazing piece of film history...",,Anonymous,History
