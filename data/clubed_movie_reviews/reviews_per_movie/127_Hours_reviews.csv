A simple plot based on a true story that kept me on the edge of my seat!,"You know, when I first heard about this movie. I didn't really know what to expect, as all I knew was it was based on a true story about a guy getting stuck in a canyon due to a boulder. I decided to give it a shot and well, I was amazed by this movie. Danny Boyle continues to give us impressive cinematography and incredible performances in his movie, thanks to James Franco, who plays as Aron Ralston, the mountain climber who gets stuck under the boulder if you didn't already know.I'm not going to go into any big spoilers, but it was amazing to see how the movie builds up to the main plot. After getting stuck under a boulder for 5 days, you're probably thinking ""How is this movie going to stay entertaining?"". Well, we witness some attempts of Aron trying to get out of the boulder, as well as using the equipment he brought with him with his backpack to try and survive. He also tries to keep himself awake so that he can live long enough to not die. When all normal attempts to escape fail, as a last resort, he does something very terrifying to get out. When this scene happened, I had to turn away in parts due to how extreme it was!With good uses of hallucinations and flashbacks to keep the story flowing, Danny Boyle has managed to make this movie as realistic as possible. Great music, great filming, and stunning performance. 127 Hours is a fantastic movie about a real-life incident that may be too disturbing to watch for some people, but I'd consider it a must see on all grounds. Definitely worthy of getting nominated for Best Picture at least surely?",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
127 HOURS - Danny Boyle right on the money,"I came into this movie with high expectations. Danny Boyle, who brought us 28 DAYS LATER and SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE had a lot to live up to with the quality of prior movies, and he did not disappoint. He brought the challenge of creating an interesting movie based on our main character being immobile to life, and captivating it was. Being stuck with our main character the entire duration of the film was anything but tedious, as we follow the thoughts of canyoneer Aron Ralston (James Franco) as he gets trapped under a rock while exploring the beautiful sights of Utah. The camera does a fabulous job taking us everywhere a wandering mind might migrate in a situation such as this.The human connection element was most fascinating, as we wonder what we would do if placed in a similar situation. We are really ""with"" Ralston on his journey, as we see him discover a reason to live and how his life perspective changes, not just how to get free from his predicament. The film manages to stay optimistic and warming, despite the frustration and angst felt by Ralston and viewers. And we certainly thank Boyle for some of the lighter moments that temper the severity of the situation.The film does not shy away from tough choices and certainly keeps it ""real"" during the entire run, especially during the critical climax scene. Despite being stuck in place the movie is fascinating at the pace with which it moves and keeps the audience's attention from start to finish. So while Ralston loves living on the edge, we see Boyle create this movie in a similar fashion, metaphorically speaking, as the intensity and gripping nature of Ralston's circumstances comes alive and sucks us in.In the movie Aron Ralston sets off on a typical weekend excursion being outdoors and with nature. During his journey he befriends a couple of female hikers who are somewhat lost and looking to get back on their way. He shows them the ropes of the canyons and they set off home. Little do they know that their friend will need their help just moments later. Becoming trapped under a rock, Ralston now is faced with the challenge of keeping himself alive while trying to break loose from the rock's firm grasp. As Aron works on a solution, we see him wonder about the party he's been invited to just hours earlier, think about how his has ignored his family, wonder about where he left his Gatorade, which would keep him hydrated longer, do a live interview featuring himself on camera, and drink his own urine.I think the part of the movie that moved me the most actually occurred after the climax, where we see Ralston, broken, desperate, and willing to end his lone-wolf mentality for good. The emotions felt during the last 5 minutes signify human triumph, perseverance, and the power of the human spirit. Incredible movie, a definite must-see 9/10 stars",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Triumph,"Sometimes (even oftentimes) in the world of film criticism, the word ""triumphant"" is thrown around. It's often used to describe a film, perhaps more often a performance. I've certainly used it; it's a term I like to pull out when a film seems to go beyond the call of duty. When it's more than art, entertainment, or a combination of both. When the story, images, and characters pop off the screen and go with you, and the lasting impression left on you means something more than having killed a couple hours in a big, dark room with a bunch of strangers. Now, after watching 127 Hours, I feel I've never used ""triumphant"" in the correct critical context before.James Franco's performance is simply astounding. He, as an actor, is triumphant because his character is, and because he delves into what it means to be bringing this incredible story to life on the big screen for mass consumption. This is a tough role - Franco is basically putting on a one-man show, and he does so elegantly. We feel Aron Ralston's pain because Franco feels his pain and shows it in every line of his face, verbalizes it with every sigh, and lets it control him even as he battles to take control back and find a way out of his dire situation.It's pure, masterful art. Franco is simply flawless. Trapped by the boulder, much of his performance lies in his facial expressions, and he is able to deftly switch from desperation to comedy to a brutal will to survive, all while being barely able to move. I've rarely been so impressed by an actor's work; Franco is wholly deserving of the Oscar.Danny Boyle's kinetic, energetic direction is a perfect match for Franco's easy-going goofiness, and even when the film becomes grounded in the narrow canyon where Ralston was trapped, Boyle always keeps things interesting. He and co-writer Simon Beaufoy weave flashbacks and hallucinations into Ralston's dilemma to great, heart-breaking effect, and the premonition that drives Ralston to finally dive whole-heartedly into amputating his own arm is breath-taking in its tenderness.Also impressive is Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle's cinematography. Instead of letting the confined space limit their camera techniques, they tackle every possible angle, often bringing the audience uncomfortably close to the action. Shots through the bottom of Ralston's water bottle mark time and heighten the sense of urgency. The addition of home movie-style footage brings Ralston even closer to the audience; when he expresses his delayed gratitude to his family, you'll likely find yourself thinking about the last time you told your parents how much you love them. It's a great device, and is put to best use in one of the film's funniest scenes, when Ralston interviews himself Gollum-style. The combination of the dark humor, varied cinematography, and Franco's impressive facial dexterity pitch the scene perfectly; it's a lighter moment that is nevertheless grounded in the gravity of the situation.Complementing and combining Chediak and Mantle's beautiful shots is Jon Harris's dynamic editing. The use of split-screen is particularly brilliant, put to use in innovative ways throughout the film: the bookend sequences mark Ralston's departure from and return to society, and the technique in general represents the multiple facets of a seemingly simple tale. Yes, when it comes down to it, 127 Hours is a film about a mountain climber who gets stuck under a boulder and has to cut off his own arm. But it's so much more than that. It's about a man overcoming the physical, emotional, and intellectual strains of an unthinkable situation. It's about responsibility, love, and the will to live. Above all, it's about the triumph of the human spirit, show more clearly and beautifully here than in any other film I can think of.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
That's gotta hurt,"I happen to love Danny Boyle ever since Renton took a dive in Scotlands most disgusting toilet. He is unique, along with partner in crime Alec Garland. BUT 127 Hours is still a survival story, not Trainspotting. And seeing it again, I feel Boyle uses way too much visual effects. We GET it, Aron is losing his mind, he is indeed stuck between a rock and a hard place. But I got tired by the ongoing, neverending ""Boyle trips"" when Aron was hallusinating. It's not a bad movie at all, but people giving it 9 or 10/10....well, it's a personal thing, but those grades are ment for 1 of 100 movies. And I for one feel that the story is more fitting as a Discovery documentary than a flashy, trippy Danny Boyle experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Boyle and Franco turn a true survival story into a powerful statement about living,"As demonstrated by his ability to earn acclaim in everything from zombie films (""28 Days Later"") to foreign coming-of-age love stories (""Slumdog Millionaire""), Danny Boyle has an extraordinary gift as a filmmaker and in ""127 Hours,"" he channels it into an extraordinary story of human willpower. This could have easily been a compelling but plain and ordinary documentary on the Discovery Channel or National Geographic about a man pinned under a boulder who miraculously survives. Boyle, however, transforms it into a powerful statement about the will to live and where that motivation truly comes from.""127 Hours"" does not simply prove the point that humans will do whatever it takes to survive in dire circumstances. In fact, I might argue 9 of 10 people wouldn't do what Aron Ralston (James Franco) does in this film. Anyway, Boyle makes it his mission to use Ralston's incredible true story -- one that told at face value would probably just elicit gasps -- to alter our perspective on living.What's obvious is that none of the impact of ""127 Hours"" is possible without Franco. A film about a man trapped in a crevice for more than five days needs a heck of a lead actor and Franco, despite few dramatic credits to this point, proves beyond capable. Although boredom might set in for some during this film given its plot, the believability of Franco's performance remains constant and irrefutable. He possesses the fun-loving and care-free charisma of Ralston then slowly breaks that shell and shows his human fragility.Yet remarkably, Boyle leaves a substantial thumbprint on the film, much of which he shares with co-writer Simon Beaufoy, also of ""Slumdog."" Because the story is so straightforward, Boyle recognizes imagery and perception provide his only means of creativity. He shows us inside the tube of Ralston's water backpack, water bottle and other close-ups, all of which seem unnecessary, but they establish images which we will come to think about with a different perspective as the film wears on, such as when Aron drinks his own settled urine out of the water pouch. Boyle uses the same process shot, but suddenly we don't see it the way we did earlier and they become more meaningful than tedious.This subtly effective technique can also be found in the beginning and ending shots of the film. It seems completely random that Boyle would open with crowded streets of people as if he's tricked us and really made ""Slumdog 2,"" but the image gains significance after experiencing Ralston's journey.""127 Hours"" will not be kind to people who don't take lightly to seeing blood outside of the ""shoot 'em up"" genre. Many of these people will leave the film thinking all they got was shock value, but of course there's much more to it. Despite the ""how will he survive?"" plot, a substantial amount of time is placed on flashes to memories Aron thinks of regarding his family, fantasies and of course, regrets. Boyle beautifully shows us that although survival seems an inherently selfish thing, much of that motivation and will to live comes from other people, even total strangers. Aron thinks a lot of the girls (Kata Mara and Amber Tamblyn) he hiked with just hours before the accident though otherwise he'd have likely forgotten them.The build-up and catharsis of Aron's story might not be the most powerful and uplifting based-on-true-story you've witnessed, but ""127 Hours"" clearly surpasses expectation in terms of the message it sends and the impact it leaves. With it, Boyle solidifies his place as one of those filmmakers you must always have an eye on and Franco emerges as a relatable everyman with above-everyman-grade talent.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
What Would You Do?,"The story of Aron Ralston is documented in this intense drama. It's the true story of Ralston who found himself stuck in a cave in Utah with his arm pinned under a bolder. I knew much of the story before I watched this film and honestly was a bit queezy as to what might be shown. I'm the sort who does not do well seeing blood and guts and watching this movie was a true test for me. If you are the type of person who gets queezy over stuff like this, I must say view with caution. If you can stomach watching this film, however, you will witness an incredible true story that you will never forget.James Franco is really good in this film. Ralston himself has said the film is very true to what actually happened. It is quite a predicament that he is in and all the thoughts that go through his mind are ones that most would contemplate. What Ralston does to survive this ordeal is unbelievable and something that many if not most people could not force themselves to do. Rating 7 of 10 starts.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A completely cathartic life-or-death experience,"I started loving this film within the first few seconds. 127 Hours begins immediately with the sound of Fresh Blood's ""Never Hear Surf Music Again"" (""There must be some f*%#ing chemical, chemical in your brain, that makes us different from animals, makes us all the same."" etc...) just as featured in the 1st trailer. That not-ripped-off euphoric feeling (how many times have you seen a trailer with a perfect song/music and then felt betrayed that it wasn't in the film later... yeah, me too) carried on all the way through the rest of the film.The film has an energetic start with a split screen showing office-bound commuters/workers going along their daily drudge while our lead, x-treme biker/hiker/climber Aron Ralston (played to perfection by actor James Franco) packs his gear (unfortunately not finding his Swiss Army knife which might have made a lot of difference to him later on) for a trek into Blue John Canyon country in Utah. While on his way he has a brief fun climbing/diving/swimming interlude with two female hikers (played by Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn). He then heads off on his own and at about 20 minutes into the movie takes a tumble with a small boulder that ends up pinning his right arm against the side wall of the thin crevice of a canyon. And that is where we are with him for the next ""127 hours"" (but only 1 hour of screen time) that it takes him to get loose.I'm not going to spoil that resolution here, although most will likely hear about it anyway before seeing the movie. An obvious clue that he survives is given by the screen credit early in the film that says it is ""based on the book Between A Rock And A Hard Place by Aron Ralston"". The guy must of survived if he wrote a book about it right? Well, you can survive in many ways and not all of them leave you whole (both mentally and physically).Director Danny Boyle brings a lot of the key Oscar-winning players of the Slumdog team back for this new film. Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy, soundtrack composer A.R.Rahman and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle (this time paired with Enrique Chediak) are chief among those. As an added bonus, from the director of the toilet-diving cam in Trainspotting, we now have the ""desperately thirsty character saves his own urine so it can be filmed while drunk through a tube""-cam in this movie.At the Toronto Film Festival's 2nd screening of the film, Boyle was there to take questions from the audience and his enthusiasm and excitement about the film were infectious. Tidbits included his talking about their 6 days of location shooting followed by a sound-stage recreation of the canyon based on 3D scanning imagery. Boyle also praised actor James Franco and emphasized how every time we see him in a new film he is stretching his talents and abilities, unlike many lead actors who are just basically playing themselves in various different situations.Boyle said that for an audience to watch what would otherwise be deemed ""unwatchable"" you either had to be making a schlocky/not-to-be-taken-seriously horror movie OR you had to make the audience completely identify with the character to the extent that they would believe that they themselves would have done the exact same thing to save themselves if they had to. Well, Boyle succeeds in making you believe it.Seen at the Ryerson Theatre, Toronto Sept. 13, 2010. 2nd screening of 3 at TIFF 2010.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A bit over-hyped for what it is, but Boyle and Franco make it really engaging and convincing throughout","There are two things that could or might work against this film. The first thing is that this is the first film from Danny Boyle since the runaway success of Slumdog – so he is a ""big"" director now and accordingly the posters for this are everywhere and awards are being muted, the star of Pineapple Express is in the lead and audiences are making it their Saturday night choice. The second of them is the plot in which essentially a rather arrogant and spoilt character gets himself into trouble and gets out of it by learning a ""lesson"" about the error of his ways. This plot could easily be on the Hallmark channel daytime schedule right now complete with corny ""I'm learning to be better"" music and warm, safe colours everywhere.The problem with the first thing is that, while these things are true, 127 Hours is essentially an independent movie, not a massive blockbuster and it is the sort of smaller fare that critics love and audiences discover – it isn't the film I expect to be on every other bus shelter. So, while it is really good that he made the decision to do a project he wanted to do rather than cashing in with the ""big"" Hollywood movie, it may lead some to expect something that the film never pretends to be. Having said that though, in regards the second challenge, thank God that this is a Danny Boyle film and not something picked up by the TV networks or less imaginative director, because this could have been corny, obvious, sentimental and cloying. In fact, Boyle appears to be working against that as much as humanly possible.We have very little time in the film before our character is alone, down a hole and trapped alone. Most of us will know where it is going and the question is how will the next 80 minutes be filled? The content of the film is indeed the character beating himself up a bit over who he is, struggling with hallucinations and become more and more fevered until he decides that he has to do what he has to do. It is really well scripted though and Boyle really delivers in terms of putting it on the screen. I thought the idea of ""self-revelation flashbacks"" sounded cheap and obvious as a device, but Boyle does it really well, making them partially remembered, flashes and even when our character is ""in"" them, he is still ""in"" his current predicament – hard to explain perhaps but it worked much better than a complete scene as a flashback. The one problem that his direction does cause is that I never felt trapped with Aron, because the camera was moving out and around so much – I know they shot it in deliberately confined setting but this didn't really come through. That said, I think that this loss is a price worth paying because it does visually engage and these flourishes and style adds more than it detracts. The soundtrack is odd a times but mostly works really well.Franco is key and this did worry me since Bole says he cast him after seeing how excellent he was in Pineapple Express – a sentiment I really don't agree with, although I though he was likable in a story that was not so likable. Here he is really, really good. He has to do a lot of thinking on his face and he makes this work while also letting his character change over the course of the ordeal. Perhaps we don't get his full character but in terms of the film the performance was really engaging and convincing.Overall 127 Hours is not the big Saturday night drama that it is billed as, it is an indie film that is very contained and not an easy sell if we're honest. However, it is also a very good film with Boyle really making it his own to the benefit of the material, avoiding the traps of sentiment that so many would have fallen into and producing an engaging situation while Franco matches him with a strong performance that easily holds the attention.",,Anonymous,Biography
A Nutshell Review: 127 Hours,"I think the reports and those who claim to have fainted when watching this is probably highly exaggerated. Sure it's graphic, but nothing not already seen in a typical torture porn film. Danny Boyle doesn't exploit this inevitable moment through lingering shots or in your face techniques, but does enough to bring forth the sheer horror and pain of the entire 127 hours ordeal that culminates with a none too pretty or neat self amputation of a limb, taking care of addressing and cutting through skin, meat, bone and tendon.Based on the memoirs of Aron Ralston's true life experience of literally being stuck between a rock and a hard place (which of course makes for a catchy book title), while I haven't read that book, Danny Boyle has weaved an incredibly fast paced picture from the get go, introducing us to Aron the weekend adventurer, who takes to the canyons for biking, climbing and exploration, played to pitch perfection by James Franco in the leading role. Quite the ladies man as well with his boyish charms and manly antics, if only to find himself never lingering at one spot, always on the go, not to allow anything to stand in his way of what could be the best weekend of his life. That is until disaster struck.When we begin from Zero hour, you can't help but feel that it's probably going to be the same with another solo, constricted space situation captured on film like Buried, which had Ryan Reynolds in a one man show buried in a box underground, and fighting for his life against his terrorist captors whom you don't see. With the camera constantly pulling to the surface of the earth just to quantify the significance of being alone and the worrying point of having nobody to contact, the narrative here doesn't get all claustrophobic on us, because Boyle made it a point for the film to be a little expansive, with various reminiscence on Aron's part, and out of body fantasy and imaginary sequences of being somewhere else other than where Aron currently is.And while that feeling of being confined is nothing new, it does make you appreciate and realize that such moments aren't far fetched, because with so many idle hours parked in between figuring out and planning how to get out, we do that idle daydream even when we're busy, so what more when we have time on our hands, with literally nowhere else to go? There's a fine balance reached where we see how Aron splits time between keeping and planning to extend his lifespan when he realizes the really deep problem he's rooted in, and that of taking time off to think about the larger picture.Which James Franco doesn't disappoint, especially when he's chronicling what could be his final hours on earth in his camcorder. He flits from being the really energetic young adult that we get introduced to, and the growingly desperate man, before basking in exuberance at the new lease of life given to him. If anyone thinks Franco is but a pretty face without substance, perhaps 127 Hours will change your mind about the actor, probably best known in his support role in Sam Raimi's Spiderman trilogy. It's almost like a one man show for about an hour of the film, so much of the weight of the film lies on Franco being able to convince us of the mixed emotions Aron goes through in different periods of the day and those hours, which he does.Danny Boyle continues to assert why he's one of the most versatile directors of today tackling a variety of genres, never running out of ideas to translate his vision in various films, always straddling between telling emotional stories that resonate even if the premise and set up screams commercial. A.R. Rahman, the Mozart of Madras continues in his second in as many collaboration with Boyle, providing original music that rocks from the start and defines the film, just like how his Chaiyya Chaiyya (though it was already used for Dil Se) did for Spike Lee's Inside Man.If there are messages to gain from the film, it is to always prepare for the unexpected, pack right and gather enough resources for the what ifs in life, and not to be a bastard in relationships, keeping an arm's length away from loved ones and/or taking them for granted. There could be a time where we find ourselves regretting for not doing some things while we can, so I guess it's up to us if we want to live life a day at a time while it's the last, or to idle it all away thinking we're invincible and infallible. Highly recommended film befitting of a nomination, but whether it could win with such illustrious company this year, will be a bit of a stretch.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
We're Still Waiting For Boyle's Masterwork,"Danny Boyle can be a very frustrating film maker . SHALLOW GRAVE was made on a total shoestring and perhaps it was this that caused it to be hype . TRAINSPOTTING was considered an unflimable novel but Boyle had a good try though he was helped by Robert Carlyle's show stopping performance as Begbie . 28 DAYS LATER had a rather derivative and illogical screenplay by Alex Garland but Boyle rose above it to make what is considered a genre masterpiece . SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE is one of the most unlikely success stories in modern cinema , a story revolving around karma , set in India with an unknown cast that the whole world fell in love with . He has had a few misses however . A LIFE LESS ORDINARY was way below ordinary , THE BEACH showed Boyle isn't suited to Hollywood style film making while SUNSHINE proved he's not suited to space opera either . Despite all this you're always expecting Boyle to come up with a masterwork that will get the whole world falling back in awe . He closest to this with SM but I always think his masterwork is still to come127 DAYS is based on the true life incident of Aron Halston , a young man who while hiking through the Utah desert fell down a crevice and had his arm trapped by a boulder and who had to take the most extreme measures to save his life . On the surface this is one of these movies award ceremonies love - courage in the face of adversity , but not something that will set the box office alight . In many ways it's something ready made for Boyle . It's not something that can be termed blockbuster but perhaps the director could weave film making magic out of it . Does he succeed ?First of all the trailer is slightly misleading . It seems similar to THE BEACH where some American dude teams up with a couple of hot chicks and does some seriously partying . Thankfully the film deviates away the marketing and concentrates on Ralston's trauma of being trapped . You're left thinking this is for the best since Ralston come across a little bit too sure of himself , a little bit too smart and a little too popular with hot chicks to get the audience entirely on his side so Boyle and screenwriter Simon Beauefoy deservesome credit in to making him something of an everyman who has dreams , ambitions and familyThis approach works well but the problem with the movie is that the whole premise doesn't comfortably lend itself to commercial film making . It's not an entirely involving film because the audience know the out come of the story and because the protagonist is on his own there's little dialogue and the story telling is done via obvious flashbacks to Ralston's life . The Discovery Channel does countless documentaries on these type of stories but they're rare in cinema and there might be a very obvious reason for this . There's two ways at looking at this1 ) Boyle deserves congratulations for making an uncinematic film2 ) The film fails because it is uncinematicThe first view is totally valid but unfortunately so is the second point to a large extentAs you might expect from Boyle it's impressive on a technical level with outstanding cinematography , editing and sound , though some people may quickly get fed up with the split screen technique . James Franco is impressive as Ralston and will certainly get an Oscar nomination but 127 HOURS will be one of the bridesmaids at the award season where THE KINGS SPEECH , BLACK SWAN and THE SOCIAL NETWORK will dominate while Boyle fans look forward to his next project",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A life-affirming near-death experience,"A hiking and climbing trip in the mountains of Utah goes wrong for rock-climber Aron Ralston (James Franco) as a loose boulder falls and crushes his arm against the rock wall. Equipped with a half-empty bottle of water, a digital camera, some rope and a (very) dull blade, Ralston must take stock of the situation and figure out a way to escape.The film is tight, pacey and not nearly as boring as it could have been in the hands of a more literal director. Danny Boyle and co. infuse every scene with energy, wowing viewers with panoramic cinematography and drilling the hard truths home when the time comes.Ralston gets his arm trapped a mere 15 minutes in and from then on it's Man vs. Rock. Boyle brings his distinctive brand of energy to the potentially static set-up, with an unpredictable and often inspired soundtrack and the surreal tangents so successfully employed in his early classic, 'Trainspotting'. Though Ralston himself may not move, his mind wanders through old memories and viewers are transported with him.Boyle has a talent for finding the life-affirming elements hidden deep within grim situations and '127 Hours' is nothing if not an exercise in hope and determination. Franco tracks Ralston's fight over the days with a sense of realism that brings the climber's plight into sharp focus, ensuring that there is much more to this film than limb-hacking.The premise is handled well and the cast and crew know the strengths of the story; the scenery is beautiful and the human elements are as familiar as they are sad, brave and ultimately liberating. When the time comes, having accompanied Ralston through his trials and setbacks, you will be there with him when the helicopter lands.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
It makes a better story than it does a movie,"127 Hours, as its title suggests, recounts the 127 hours that hiker and rock climber Aron Ralston spends stranded in a slot canyon, based on recounts of the true story in Ralston's best-selling memoir ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"". After an accident with a loose rock, Ralston stumbles into a crevice and ultimately lands with his right arm wedged tightly between the rock and the canyon wall. As the days pass by, Ralston runs low on water, uses up his food, and his efforts at chipping away at the rock with a dull knife seem to be in vain. The only thing that keeps him going are promises he made to his family and the hope that he would one day see his loved ones again.As you can imagine, this movie is as much director Danny Boyle's as it is James Franco's. When nearly all of the film's 94 minutes consist of Franco's psychological turmoil, his acting has to carry the movie, and as expected, Franco pulls it off very nicely. Expect some terrific and believable acting as Ralston struggles not only to free himself from the rocky prison, but also to come to terms with personal mistakes he made earlier in his life. However, 127 Hours may unwittingly fall into the category of 'psychological thriller', and with such a genre comes some strong expectations: intense scriptwriting and extraordinary acting. While the film may not necessarily be a ""thriller"" because it purposely recounts the real-life story of Aron Ralston, it still falls victim to its requirements; and this is where we see a disappointment in the movie. Nothing is missing from the acting side, but the script is regular, rather boring, and predictable. We know Ralston is still alive, we know he suffered, we know some parts were gritty- but no flourish is added to the original story to make it interesting. Everything is straightforward- no twists. 127 Hours wishes itself to be more engaging than it actually is. Still, it stays close to the facts of the book, which leads me to the conclusion that Ralston's tale makes a better story than it does a movie (and that psychological thrillers may not be Boyle's strong suit).James Franco puts out a terrific role in this movie, but aside from his performance you can't expect anything too out-of-the-ordinary or impressive. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
-Best film of the year-,"Danny Boyle has outdone himself this time as well as James Franco in a film which to me is hands down the best film of the year, Oscar contenders get ready to be defeated! From beginning to end the movie has energy, creativity, fun and intense thrills and the best one man show since Cast Away. You get invested in this character and relate to him and feel that you are right there with him with his fight for survival and just a heads up for the squeamish that thing get pretty graphic in some scenes and if you read the book you know what I mean. This movie is so inspirational, moving, intimate and makes you want to live life to the fullest and it shows how precious life is, you'll be thankful to be alive and well. The cinematography is outstanding in this and Danny Boyle deserves an Oscar for best director because this is ten times better than Slumdog Millionaire.

Its strengths are its weaknesses,"127 Hours is an interesting movie because its strengths can also be its weaknesses. It's slow, not much happens and it is weirdly surreal. It depends on the audience how it's received.I actually thought this movie would rely more heavily on flashbacks than the actual situation the main character is in. It's better this way.While the cinematography and soundtrack are amazing, this movie still feels a bit weird because of how slow it is. It's very thrilling, very agonising, and it's pace makes it even worse - which makes it of course better.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Gripping, Intense, Emotional, & Amazing","Gripping, intense, and emotional would probably be the three best adjectives to describe Danny Boyle's 127 Hours. I'll admit that when I first heard the news that someone had a literal panic attack during the screening at Telluride, I was super excited to see it, as it could only have meant that the film was truly genuine and amazing. My assumptions were correct, as Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy (who also wrote the Slumdog Millionaire script with the director) put together another great film, this time with the challenge of one actor on screen for the entire movie. For those of you unfamiliar with the movie, 127 Hours tells the story of real life climber Aron Ralston (Franco) and his struggle to survive after his arm gets trapped under a boulder while mountaineering near Moab, Utah.Going into a film like this, one would wonder how a movie with one actor and essentially one filming location could entertain an audience for about 90 minutes. Well, Danny Boyle did an excellent job of keeping people glued to the screen without taking away from the film and boring audience members. With his funky style of directing, amazing camera shots, as well as his ability to bring so much information and life into a one man show, Boyle tackled this daunting task beautifully. The directors uses of Ralston's fantasies, hallucinations, comedic relief, and the character's will to live all helped keep audience members interested, and wondering how and when this man would survive such an catastrophe.Now to the leading man of the film, James Franco. I will admit, before this film I had never seen Franco give an awe-inspiring performance in any film really, but 127 Hours was his calling card. People should take notice, because this guy can really hold his own both on screen and off. Franco gave a fantastic performance in this one, and really made the character of Aron Ralston believable to the audience (which is what good actors do). He played the role seriously, but also gave the audience the much needed comedic relief, evening out the intensity of the film with a little bit of good humor. This isn't an easy role to portray for any actor, and it seemed as though Franco tackled it with ease, playing a disgruntled and challenging Ralston, and the different moods and emotions he feels while being trapped.I would be insane not to give credit to both Simon Beaufoy and Danny Boyle for writing another excellent screenplay. Unlike their previous film, Slumdog Millionaire, which was an excellent screenplay, this one stands out more simply because of the limitations they had when writing it. Essentially, it was a dialogue prepared for one man to speak to himself for about 80 minutes, mostly through his hand-held video camera.This movie is getting the granny apple A it deserves; the combination of great directing, writing, and an amazing performance by James Franco, truly make this film a remarkable one. The ability to overcome challenges and limitations, like Boyle did in this film, is what I believe separates the great directors from the good ones. Furthermore, the pace, intensity, suspense, and even Boyle's added humor, all add to the amalgamation of this films success. The films funkiness, brilliance, and realism faze out the idea that there is only one actor on screen sitting in the same location for almost the entirety of the film. The real life Aron Ralston summed the film up perfectly during the emotional Q&A session at the end of the film saying ""Humans have no idea of their true potential or what the are capable of, given the situation they're in."" 127 Hours comes out on November 5, 2010, and unless you get queasy very easily, it is definitely a must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best What You Could Make Of The Story,"Well since you're here you probably already read the description of the story. I personally don't think it a good one but if you were content with ""Phone Booth"" or other stories revolving around the same person being stuck at the same place for one and a half hours then this is for you.Of course this movie has the usual stuff to keep the average viewers from losing interest but only for the first few scenes. I'm not saying this movie is poorly made - only that it is boring. Various techniques have been used trying to prevent this obvious flaw. I mean: some guy stuck under a boulder for 127 hours? Wow that sounds ""adventurous"".",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Creative Directing,"I wondered how filmmakers were going to keep the viewers interested in a guy stuck in crevice for five days. I found out: unique photography, a little humor here and there, a little romance, a little family sentiment, and a great job by both lead actor James Franco and director Danny Boyle.The two combined to make much more of what could have been a boring film. They kept it interesting all the way.It all added up to an entertaining film, not something I'd watch a number of times but one I'm glad I rented. This is a special treat in high-def, too, with the amazing Utah scenery and the unique camera shots by Boyle. That includes a number of split-screens and other creative stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Man vs. Nature,"Adapting mountaineer Aron Ralston's autobiography 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place' , Danny Boyle gives us a reconstruction of his freak accident in a remote Utah canyon, and his outré survival tactics during the 127 hours he was caught between a rock and a wall in a hard place. What saves Ralston, besides near-mythical courage, is his engineering expertise. He attempts to make pulleys to dislodge the boulder. When these fail he is forced to break bones to slice off his decayed arm, using inappropriate cutting tools to do so.Hard to make this compulsive viewing, as most of the static action takes place in a canyon. But then Boyle is the man who immortalised Irvine Welsh's 'Trainspotting', another book thought to be unfilmable. We've seen breathtaking scenery before, but not like this. Luscious photography means you don't physically have to be in this region to appreciate its grandeur.To hold our attention, Boyle throws everything at us: split screen, catchy pop songs, state-of-the art special effects. I have only a few reservations, but they are significant. I didn't like the scenes of phantasmagoria. I felt they came too often and were off-putting. I also disliked James Franco's portrayal. Praise has been given for him being able to convincingly capture Ralston's self-deprecation and charm, but there's a reason he wasn't Boyle's first choice (British actor Cillian Murphy was): he's as flat as parts of Utah.Sometimes, when a film does phenomenally well, like Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionaire', the success somehow attaches to the director's next film, regardless of the critical reception, and our objectivity gets distorted. It's as though we see their next film with predetermined praise. I think that's what audiences the world over are doing with this film.By his own admission Boyle prefers to make 'vivacious' rather than 'serious' films. '127 Hours' does not contradict. This is another demonstration of style over substance. Sad, given that Ralston did not want his 'life-affirming' experience to be commodified.www.scottishreview.net",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Typical Danny Boyle Movie,"""127 Hours"" is based on a true story of Aron Ralston. If you don't know who Ralston is then the ending might be a big surprise to you. It's quite inspiring and superior. Anyways the filmmaking was obviously decent. Danny Boyle's directing is a little bit overrated. Then the strong performance of James Franco. ""127 Hours"" is a movie that you already know what it's going to be.This can be called ""Buried"" with flashbacks and origins of the incident. ""127 Hours"" is non-fiction and Danny Boyle wanna show the real gore that happened. Which is a good thing. Boyle is using his same old directing style but now it has montage and some product placement. James Franco's performance was pretty strong and the cinematography is definitely good.Danny Boyle's movies are usually overrated but it is still entertaining though. It's definitely worth watching but you might get disappointed if you are expecting something enormous. ""127 Hours"" is a plain Danny Boyle movie and again it's obviously decent.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
James Franco Vs. Nature,"The drama 127 Hours is directed by Danny Boyle and starring James Franco, Kate Mara, and Amber Tamblyn. The film takes place in 2003 in Moab, Utah.Aron Ralston (Franco) is a mountain climber who decides to go to the place in Moab, Utah where he has the whole course memorized for his daily thrill. While bike riding, walking, and running around he meets up with two girls Kristi (Mara) and Megan (Tamblyn) and for a short while the three of them go climbing and swimming and all that crazy stuff. Well after the girls leave he gets himself into quite a predicament. While jumping onto a branch he slips and knocks a rock down which crushes his right arm. Oops. The rest of the film is about hallucinations he is having and flashbacks to his family and an old girlfriend. That's why I don't mountain climb, I just write film reviews so I can't my arm crushed.The screenplay by Simon Beaufoy and Danny Boyle was pretty good. This film could have been equally torturous for the viewer as it was for Aron Ralston but it didn't really drag on for the full length of the film, it flowed nicely. The problem with a true story is that the second you go in there you know how it's going to end so the whole time I was like none of this matters I know what's going to happen. I did not see the need to put the flashbacks of his girlfriend in there because it never led up to anything, it didn't even really help with characterization it just showed that Ralston once had a girlfriend but now he's trapped in a canyon. The dialogue for the whole of the film was very believable, usually when one person is talking to themselves it doesn't work out very well but here it works very nicely.Danny Boyle had some pretty stylized direction on this one, and it helped keep the film entertaining throughout. Is this film as good as his previous, Slumdog Millionaire? No. Personally I believe Boyle's best film to be Trainspotting which also had a lot of style and I think Boyle is much more comfortable with stylistic films than something which cannot have a stylistic influence upon it. I like how Boyle does films in multiple genres: Slumdog Millionaire-fantasy, Trainspotting-crime, 28 Days Later-horror, Sunshine-science fiction, and 127 Hours-real life drama. All of Boyles directing decisions I think were fine with this film, the only reason I couldn't give it a higher score is because the story is very limited to a guy trapped in a rock and he couldn't really put in any crazy mind games to add another layer of interest.James Franco easily gave the best performance of his career so far and it would be shocking if he did not receive an Oscar nomination for Best Actor at this year's Academy Awards. Will he win it? I highly doubt it. In the film Aron Ralston is fun, carefree kind of guy who climbs mountains to just to have a good time. When he gets trapped he starts to lose hope and his mind a bit. The part where Franco delivers his best in the film is when he is pretending to interview himself because it just shows how low he has gotten. This is the first time Franco has ever really been in a lead role, I know him mostly for his supporting roles in Spiderman and Pineapple Express, but as a lead man he is very impressive and has a bright career in front of him.The only real supporting cast in this film was Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn as the two girls Ralston meets before he gets trapped. Both girls did a fine job but nothing really noteworthy. They were basically just average girls who are just following a path for fun. There wasn't really enough acting in the flashbacks to criticize but none of them were bad enough to notice.Overall I give this film a 7/10, the only reason I couldn't give it higher was because the script was very limiting and I already knew how it would end since it is a famous story. If you like films like Into the Wild or other man vs. nature type films then you would like this one as well. Franco and Boyle both have very bright careers for the future even though they both had very successful careers before this Franco will make his way as a leading man and Boyle will still be one of the best directors of today.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sometimes you see a film that really makes a impact on you...,"For me '127 Hours' is that film.I was drawn in by James Franco's portrayal of Aron Ralston, and wasn't disappointed at any point, his free spirit connects you with his character, causing you to experience his emotional and mental struggle later on.Visually appealing, Danny Boyle uses some great techniques and shots to move the story on. Personally nothing feels forced or wrong, and the effects are believable and realistic.As like most great films the perfect soundtrack accompanies it. The music adds a greater depth to this film, really showing how much care has gone into it.This film is an experience and one that everybody should take.

The only thing that carry movie was the fact that this is a real life story, which gets your mind to think about the situation and what you would have done there and keep on watching it.It is not that interesting what it claims, I prefer '' I shouldn't be alive'' by the Discovery channel , The best part of it was the talk show like thingy in the middle of despair and who forgets the amazing word ''ooops''. The only thing that i was soo much disappointed with Danny Boyle was he never let us settle with the emotions of loss, helplessness ,sorrow, despair ....which was the main theme of the movie to engage the audiences.

Style over substance?,"For some reason I keep on comparing this film to ""Buried"": the concept and the scope of both films is pretty much the same. One person stuck in a confined place for the whole length of the film. But while in ""Buried"" the director was able to keep the entire film inside the box and never ""cheated"" by giving the audience flashbacks or shots of whatever was happening in the outside world, here in ""127 Hours"" director Danny Boyle uses every trick in the book to make the visual more exciting and sometimes to the expense of the emotional response that one should have for a story of this kind. Split screens, speeded up/trippy sequences, long zooms out from a tiny close up of James Franco's face to the widest view of the Canyon. Surely it makes it all exciting to watch, yes the photography is beautiful (2 different Directors of Photography were used for this film. And by the way that first bicycle riding sequence is really breath-taking), yes the editing is as flashy as it can be (in fact I think it's easier to produce showy editing of this kinds than proper invisible one But then again, wait and see how this one will win the Oscar), but when it comes to getting really close to our main character, knowing his history, his background, his life, that's when the film fails for me. Listening to a Q&A sessions with the makers at the end of the film, I was actually intrigued to hear about the real story and I started longing for a documentary about it Hold on a second Would I need a documentary if the film had satisfied me completely? It's really not James Franco's fault! He gives the performance of his career and I can easily see an Oscar nomination coming his way, the problem is that Boyle is so preoccupied about whizzes and bangs, about his visual flashy style and about making you feel so trapped like the main character has, that he forgets what the story (and the original book) was really be about: a cathartic experience about a man who's accepted his own death and looks back at his life realising all the mistakes he's done. In the end it just becomes a story about the power of self preservation. It's absolutely not a bad film, but this one could have been so much deeper and fuller, at least to match the fullness of the visuals (and its soundtrack too, I should add, as always in a Boyle's film, was very accomplished). People will love, I'm sure about that, but I really wanted a masterpiece out of this one, like the trailer made it look like. At the end of the day, the style of the film won over the actual substance e reduced it to just a good one, but not a great one. Moviegeekblog.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Intense, stylish and personal","Danny Boyle has been consistently giving us amazing films like Trainspotting, Slumdog Millionaire and Steve Jobs. Once again, Boyle succeeds with 127 Hours.127 Hours is the true story of a man named Aron Ralston who gets trapped under a boulder whilst canyoneering near Utah.Danny Boyle once again makes a fantastic film that managed to keep me on edge the entire time. What I really loved about 127 Hours was how personal it felt. We're with Ralston for the whole movie and so I felt a connection with him as he went on this expedition. The cinematography was absolutely gorgeous. The shakyness and close ups whilst Ralston was under the boulder created a claustrophobic and intense feeling that left me on edge till the end. Boyle is a stylish director and brought a lot of style to the film with some of the shots and the use of flashbacks and hallucinations. I wish Boyle held back a bit with his style as it would have made the film feel more raw and gritty but at the same time it actually brought me closer into the mind of Aron Ralston. It helped create a personal connection between him and the audience as we got an understanding of his perspective of the situation.James Franco is truly outstanding here. This film is a one man show and so there is a lot of weight he has to carry but he does really well. I wholeheartedly believed the pain and struggle he was going through especially during the climax which is certainly not for the faint hearted. The editing was sharp, clocking in at 95 minutes, but some of the techniques like the split screen got a bit repetitive after a while.Despite that, 127 Hours is another triumph for Danny Boyle. The film was engaging and tense throughout and James Franco delivered a knockout performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Harrowing, If Nothing Else","There is a threshold for single location films at which they overcome their self-imposed limitations, and though ""127 Hours"" rockets past that point, I don't think it ever transcends its premise. Danny Boyle is a great director, and this is a good film, but there's no getting around the fact that its scope is as limited as the resources in Aron Ralston's backpack.An adaptation of ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place,"" Ralston's true account of having his arm lodged beneath a boulder in an isolated Utah canyon, Boyle's interpretation relies perhaps a little too heavily on the built-in adjectives like 'harrowing' and 'powerful;' he doesn't seem to add many of his own. The film is certainly more successful than this year's ""Buried,"" in which Ryan Reynolds spends the entirety of a film trapped inside a coffin in Iraq, but then Ryan Reynolds is no James Franco.Franco's multifaceted performance really anchors the film and keeps it from becoming stagnant. The journey of his character, from devil-may-care adventurer to anguished prisoner, is kept in constant motion even though he is physically immobile. Franco embraces not only what makes Ralston heroic, but also what makes him human, and we need that accessibility in order to participate in the film's more brutal moments.And Boyle definitely doesn't disappoint in the intensity department. More so than any filmmaker in recent memory, he commands attention with his unflinching depictions of violence here. On the off chance that some aren't yet familiar with the outcome of Ralston's story, I won't spoil it—suffice it to say ""127 Hours"" is not for the squeamish. I consider myself among a generation of roundly desensitized moviegoers, but the way Boyle puts the screws to his audience during key sequences is undeniably affecting. Expect to do a fair amount of squinting and inhaling through gritted teeth.I only wish the film on the whole had the same impact as those isolated scenes. Boyle cobbles together what little conventional narrative he can from the five day ordeal, but it never fully ensnares. Flashbacks seem like a given, though the brief instances of escape we witness via dream or memory aren't especially interesting until they began mingling with Ralston's increasingly distorted reality. Even still, I'd argue Boyle doesn't dig deep enough into Ralston's deteriorating mental state—merely explaining the emotional impetus for his physical actions is about as far as he goes.Part of the problem may be the visual experimentation Boyle implements in the interest of keeping things fresh. It serves that purpose fine—""127 Hours"" is a lively, energetic film in spite of its subject matter. In a way, however, the triptych music video approach feels like Boyle taking the easy way out. After all, the man is a master of genres; a greater feat might have been to capture the quiet desolation and solemnity of Ralston's trip through equally inauspicious filmmaking. It would never have been as exciting a film, but it might have been a better one.Don't get me wrong, ""127 Hours"" is still a terrific accomplishment, and one for which Boyle and Franco deserve joint recognition. It feels like a minor entry into the esteemed director's oeuvre, but the creative decisions he made (fault them though I might) showcase his ever- innovative eye for shooting and editing. The visceral impact of the images he conveys is unquestionably the foremost strength of this film, and it is that aspect that critics have already lauded and audiences will doubtless remember.The effectiveness of such scenes earn ""127 Hours"" an adjective like 'harrowing.' I just can't quite bring myself to call it powerful.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Boyle and Franco excel for 1.5 hours,"127 Hours is a film about five days in the life of real-life outdoorsman and mountain climber Aron Ralston when he back in 2003 fell down in a narrow, deep canyon and got himself trapped by a boulder in Canyonlands National Park in Utah. It is a small film when it comes to events, but a massive film when it comes to psychological depth, depiction of personal struggle, and the power of character.Danny Boyle has long since established himself as one of our time's greats, after debuting with the clever Shallow Grave in 1994 and moving on to the hard-hitting Trainspotting, before winning the Academy Award for Best Director for Slumdog Millionair two years ago. In 127 Hours, his characteristic directorial style is more distinct and refined than ever, with trademark hip hop montages used in arguably the most productive way in the history of cinema since Boyle's own Trainspotting or Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream. Boyle excels stylistically in 127 Hours, but never is the effect showy or debauched; every camera-movement, cut and juxtaposition contribute to the part inspirational part gut-clenching portrayal of a man who sinks ever deeper into himself in an existential battle to find the strength to survive.James Franco's performance is immensely strong. It reminds me of Sam Rockwell's work in last year's brilliant Moon in that the challenges the two characters face are isolation, uncertainty and their own inner demons. There are no interpersonal elements, no easy escapes, no relief, and despite this static nature, Boyle manages to make 127 Hours a tight, suspenseful and grippingly realistic experience. I expect Oscar nominations for both gentlemen.*Review written in 2011.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Danny Blabla deserves praise for making a cohesive film from what could have been a huge mess. The cinematography is managed by BUbuBLAbla and he deserves recognition for using very sleazy and uncomfortable camera-work to elicit the necessary emotion from the viewer. James Franco deserves a round of applause for making a potentially very embarrassing role to see, into something touching.

Deliverance,"A young man named Aron Ralston (James Franco) sets out on a solo hike into the empty and rugged Canyonlands of Utah. But his quest for adventure turns ugly when he encounters a villainous large rock. It's a story of wilderness survival reminiscent of the 1972 film ""Deliverance"". But whereas ""Deliverance"" is fictional, ""127 Hours"" is a true story.There are several problems I have with this film, not the least of which is the character of Aron Ralston. In ""127 Hours"" he comes across as cocky, too sure of himself, disrespectful of the desert, and vain. He talks into a video cam as if the world fixates on every word he mumbles and every step he takes. He's inattentive. And he takes way too much for granted.In addition, the film's script is poorly plotted. Aron's dilemma gets stretched out way too long, resulting in tedium and boredom for many viewers. With a runtime of 94 minutes, his plight consumes fully sixty minutes ... just Aron, that villainous rock, and various plot contrivances that pad the story, including hallucinations and dreams, story flashbacks, efforts to set himself free, and that annoying, ever-present video cam. A much better structure would have been for the script to have shown Aron on previous successful hikes, leading up to the midpoint plot turn, with his predicament postponed until the second half.Further, the film's loud, intrusive music contradicts the silence of a wilderness trek. Yet it does foster the impression that Aron is basically an urban guy who, despite his yearn for wilderness, can't let go of modern conveniences. The flashy, gimmicky cinematography also is out of sync with a wilderness theme, and included seemingly to mask a story that otherwise is not really cinematic.The scenery is beautiful. And the script's underlying premise is quite compelling, given that the events really happened.A wilderness experience can be worthwhile and enjoyable if, and only if, a person takes seriously all of the things that could go wrong. Aron Ralston didn't do that. And for his recklessness he paid dearly.",,Anonymous,Biography

Inspiration on screen,"By the end of ""127 Hours"" when Aron Ralston (James Franco) gruesomely removes himself from the 800-pound boulder his arm is pinned to, we, the audience, are left in a euphoric state. It is a celebration of the great victory of a man overcoming death and finding the will to survive. This film is such an intense experience. Director Danny Boyle and James Franco take us on an exhilarating journey of the shock, acceptance, regret, anger, and hope that resulted in this reviewer squirting a few tears of joy. ""127 Hours"" is the story of a life inspired put on screen and easily one of the better films of the year.Based on best selling memoir, ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"", Ralston recounts the events that took place in Utah's Blue John Canyon in April of 2003. Boyle introduces us to the film and to Ralston with an energetic opening split screen of dutch shots (static shot from a slanted angle) of busy crowds alongside Ralston hurriedly grabbing his gear in his apartment for his weekend trip. Boyle doesn't drop the hammer right away, instead showing the exuberance of Ralston playing in his nirvana. When Aron comes upon two pretty girls lost in Blue John he plays guide and shows the ladies the best way to reach the deep bright blue lake. Ralston parts with the girls, skipping off to his next destination.Shortly thereafter, the solitary Ralston slips resulting in his arm being stuck. This is where the film would have been lost with a lesser actor. But Franco seizes every scene as he and Boyle begin to put us through the emotional ringer. Franco impressively relays those first few moments of paralyzed shock, to angrily realizing his will and determination alone aren't enough to save him, to beginning to assess the situation and think his way out. The only things he has with him are his camcorder, watch, climbing gear, a cheap dull knife and most importantly, very little food and even less water. Ralston's greatest asset is that, for the most part, he is not one who panics, which Franco maneuvers by using his goofy nature to keep his wits about him.Since Ralston is the sole character on screen for the majority of the movie, Danny Boyle uses music as another character. Opening with the kinetic ""Never Hear Surf Music Again"" from Free Blood, to pulling an exhausted Ralston and audience back up with Bill Withers ""Lovely Day"", Boyle never lets the film get stagnant from the restraints of his location. This is due in great part of his successful decision to use two cinematographers in Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak. The two different visions play off each other as Aron Ralston struggles with the physical and psychological effects of being trapped. Extreme close-ups of Franco and nifty camera shots through the water bottle keep the viewer tightly encased with Aron.What Boyle really gets right is putting us in Aron's head. The longer Aron is forced to look death in the eye, the more his memories, nightmares, and delusions pop up. When Aron's mind races all the way back to his vehicle for the Gatorade he left on the seat, as commercial visions of beverage refreshment take over, I've never been so thirsty. Regrets and an inner look at his life's decisions become more agonizing than the physical aspect. Realizing his selfishness of not picking up his mother's phone calls or letting the girl get away, torment Aron but it's the vision of what life has in store for him that ultimately leads him out of peril. When the self-amputation scene arrives it may be too strong for some but it is necessary. The intensity it takes to do such a thing creates a powerful moment that won't quickly leave your memory. Inspired is the best word for what remains because you're left there finding what you want to live for and how you'd lose an arm to do it. When Ralston miraculously sees people, he screams, ""I need help"", for the first time in his life allowing himself not to be a superhero.""127 Hours"" is definitely up there with ""Trainspotting"" as one of Danny Boyle's best films and I don't need to say it but I will anyway; it's a foregone conclusion that James Franco will be nominated for Best Actor and at this point I've seen no other performance that would beat it.I've seen no other performance that would beat ""this"" Matthew 24:13﻿",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great 'trapped in a single location' film,"I'm a sucker for these types of films: you know, where one or more characters are stuck in a situation and have to use their brains to get out of it. Films like CUBE, FROZEN, some parts of the SAW series, hell, even going back to the '80s with the likes of EVIL DEAD 2, I love the freedom that one or a small group of actors on a single set brings.The much-hyped 127 HOURS comes to us based on a true story, which has both good and bad points. The good side is that it enhances the 'it could happen to you' feeling while you're watching. The bad side is that most viewers will already know the ending before they start watching.Nevertheless, this turns out to be a great and gripping movie, even if I did know what happened beforehand. Danny Boyle, who I haven't always liked in the past (I hate TRAINSPOTTING with a vengeance), manages to keep the film pacey and engaging despite not much happening for the duration. He uses frenetic camera-work, flashbacks, monologues and snapshots of the beautiful, arid locales to great effect.This is a film that emphasises realism above all else, and again, there are good and bad sides to that. James Franco (delivering a solid performance) plays a guy who isn't exactly likable or sympathetic, yet that serves to make the tale that unfolds all the more believable. Yes, 127 HOURS contains one of the most excruciating sequences ever put on film, but it's not really about the visceral side of the experience: it's instead a great psychological study of the human mind put in a situation with seemingly no way out.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Remarkable, thoughtful, and tactful","You know what this movie is about, and you've heard the hype. Audience members were reportedly vomiting and leaving the theater during opening weekend because of the amputation scene. Very few movies have had such hype, and as I am a notoriously squeamish viewer, I heeded the advice of my brother and his friends who told me not to rent it. Since it's James Franco's week here at Hot Toasty Rag, I knew I had to rent it; how can you celebrate someone's films and ignore the one that garnered him his only Oscar nomination? I was fully prepared to hide behind my hands or my pillow and had both at the ready, but such drastic measures were never taken.The great tragedy of the film, and what makes it hard to watch, is that it's based on a true story. As you watch James Franco drink his own urine and eat his contact lenses, you're constantly reminded that someone else actually did those things. It's similar to All is Lost, a one-person drama about a man stranded in the middle of the ocean on a life raft, but with the difference that 127 Hours is not pure entertainment. It's a horrifying tragedy that makes you want to hug your loved ones very tightly.A movie like this is very tricky to master because the entire audience knows exactly what's going to happen. When we watched James Cameron's Titanic, we were so immersed in the story that even when we saw the iceberg appear, we still thought there was a chance the ship might sail around it. Every scene of 127 Hours is well-timed and well thought out, immersing us so much that even though we know what's going to happen, we're held in incredible suspense as we watch it unfold. In a film focused on an actor pinned down by a rock, the audience could easily get bored, distracted, or taken out of the drama of the scenes. Every scene is riveting and important, and you can hardly stand blinking, let alone getting distracted or looking away. The opening scene shows Franco packing his backpack as he prepares to go on a hike. We know what's going to happen, so we pay attention to his water bottle, Gatorade stash, ropes, flashlight, and of course, his pocketknife. Twice, he's seen reaching blindly on a tall shelf but unable to find his Swiss Army Knife. Filmed from inside the cabinet, the audience cringes and groans as he leaves the knife behind.The final opening title card isn't shown until 16 minutes in, at the immediate moment Franco falls down the crevice and gets pinned in by the boulder. That brief scene is so fantastic, because even though the audience has been waiting for it to happen, when it does, we get the same sinking feeling in the pit of our stomach as Franco. ""It really happened,"" we say to ourselves as he tugs and pushes in vain.A self-described ""action movie with a guy who can't move,"" 127 Hours rests entirely on James Franco's shoulders. No matter how fast-paced Jon Harris's editing, no matter how thoughtful Danny Boyle's directing, if the lead actor was unconvincing or unlikable, the movie wouldn't have worked. This is not a slice-of-life movie where a character is showcased for a few days and doesn't have to grow or change; this an exposing, grueling, emotional experience. In ninety minutes, he transforms from someone carefree, confident, sexy, and joyful to someone lonely, frightened, and doomed. Franco is seen urinating uncontrollably, saying goodbye to his parents on his camcorder, and flicking ants off his face. He reaches to feel a glimmer of sunshine with his foot with equal realism as when he admits to the camcorder that he knows when he's going to die.During the infamous scene, there was plenty of grunting, pain, struggle, and determination that would make any viewer cry out, ""Give him his Oscar for crying out loud!"" but to me, the moment of aftermath was his greatest moment in the entire film. The shock, incredulity, sorrow, regret, fear, and hope of what he's just accomplished all mingle into an indescribable three seconds. I don't know what James Franco pulled from to give that expression on his face, but the result was remarkable.Franco delivered an incredible tour-de-force performance that deserved to win an Academy Award every bit as much as Colin Firth's from The King's Speech. No one but Franco himself knows the depth of his disappointment that night, but hopefully he was a little consoled that he got beaten out by a veteran actor who turned out a great performance. 2010 was not another 1955, thank goodness.Had this movie been made a mere ten years later, I'm sure the amputation scene would have been dragged out and filmed with a far more gruesome mindset. Films have become noticeably bloodier in recent years, and I'm so glad Danny Boyle-who tragically was not even nominated for Best Director-and all involved handled the scene with such tact and care. Trust me; watching this movie will not make you vomit, and you won't need to be carried out of your home theater room in a stretcher. Rent it. You'll love this raw, powerful movie, and you probably won't be able to stop talking about it for weeks afterwards.DLM Warning: : If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend. Nearly every single minute of the film is shot either in split-screen, with handheld techniques, sudden movements, or odd perspective. Unfortunately it will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good but nowhere near worthy of a Best Picture nom,"There's something about this film that just didn't click for me.I already knew going into the film what was going to happen as I was aware of the real life story, so I was just sort of waiting for that one scene to happen. As a result, even though it was a very short film it dragged a little bit waiting to get there.It was very well acted by James Franco, and the story is remarkable, but stretching it out for an entire feature length film I don't think quite worked. For some reason it never felt tense or emotional which it really should have done.I also didn't particularly rate the direction from Danny Boyle. I'm not a huge fan of his style. I think some stuff he does very well but he throws in some rather odd creative choices that I don't enjoy.Undoubtedly a good story, the way that Aron Ralston handled the events was impressive, but if you already know what happens you may not find the film overly tense or engaging,A good watch nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
127 Hours swiftly counts down every enduring hour to its grotesquely effective amputation.,"Canyonlands National Park, Utah. Smooth slot canyons, intricately weaving through the desolate landscape, bask in the beating sunlight. Its burning rays illuminating the curvaceous formations that guide hikers to their idyllic destination. Aron Ralston, an adventurous mountaineer, one day journeys across the park. Befriending fellow backpackers, presenting them with natural wonders kept hidden from sight. Underground pools harnessing crystal clear water, just a leap of faith away. After a joyous separation, he lonesomely traverses Bluejohn Canyon. Hurtling over deceased wood and precarious boulders. He slips. A loosened large boulder follows his trajectory. Falling from gracious heights, Aron's right hand becomes wedged in 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place'. He cries for urgent assistance. But only his echoes reply. With limited supplies, time was running out. Aron, confronted with destiny, must overcome his own mentality to succumb to the inevitable action that would free his temporary imprisonment.Boyle's adaptation of Ralston's biographical memoir, initially, resembled the standardisation of trapped thrillers. One individual with a select amount of tools at their disposal must escape from the claustrophobic location that is holding them custody. An engrossing central performance, undoubtedly Franco's best dramatic endeavour thus far, allows the particular central character to experience an array of emotions from determination to desperation, before developing a moral compass that had since been disregarded. These enclosed survival thrillers have been executed before. However, what enables 127 Hours to stand above the competition and garner several Academy Award nominations in the process, is Boyle's direction. It's a pure example of exuberance elevating a simplistic yet solidly constructed personable ordeal. He is able to embed an urban aesthetic, despite the rural environment, that increases the core frenetic energy throughout.Aron gulping on the slowly diminishing water supply is made increasingly apparent by employing a camera within the bottle itself. Aron chipping away parts of the boulder with an inexpensive multi-tool or him pushing the obstacle with his entire body force, are made inclusively exhausting through camera actions that jolt forward with each momentous push. The gorgeous aerial footage capturing the endless horizons of the National Park, securing his unfortunate solidarity. Harris' signature editing stylistics, notably the split screen time lapses of fast-moving society, illustrating Ralston's putrefying mentality whilst maintaining Boyle's metropolitan buoyancy. All culminating in a visceral scene that invades every sense available. The inevitable amputation that audiences were fainting over, even before the film was theatrically released. It's an impeccable reaction, not due to the biographical nature of 127 Hours, but the invasive filming style. The piercing sound effects when Ralston slashes a tendon and the abrupt camera rotation when he initially breaks the arm. Perfect examples of employing realistic imagination without displaying the act's gratuitous gore in its entirety. Such directorial flair that, not only visually engages, but narratively powers through the sparse screenplay.127 Hours is unsurprisingly only eight-nine minutes in length. The first ten minutes introduces Ralston through a dutch angled bike ride across the park (Darude's 'Sandstorm' anyone?) before presenting the main claustrophobic event. The initial problem with this, is that the emotional connectivity with the central character takes precious time to develop. Time that unfortunately this feature does not have the luxury of expending. It's not until the third act when you start cheering for his survival, and that's an issue. Flashbacks and premonitions are embedded throughout to grant some much needed characterised background, however the harrowing ordeal of his physical pain overwhelms the tender interior experiences. Had there been additional introductory development, these succinct moments would've been substantially more effective. Franco also occasionally seemed somewhat unrealistically calm in several situations, in particular the day transitions when Withers' 'Lovely Day' would ironically play, which lacked an authentic continuity.Still, Boyle will always remain as a leading director in visual storytelling. With that, 127 Hours may just be his most personable and audacious feature yet. As a depiction of brute survival, enlisting the tactics of claustrophobic film-making, it's a resounding success that will leave viewers wanting a solid 127 hour runtime. The personal touches however required more development in order to make Ralston a hugely relatable individual. We can all agree on one lesson though. Never go mountaineering by yourself, and certainly tell someone where you have gone...",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
a survival story with little action,"I thought this movie was OK, but I would have liked more action. It was more of a made for TV movie. Some how the writer made it stretch out over 90 minutes even though most of the film has Aron trapped by the boulder. To fill space, we are shown what Aron's thinking about, like drinking water and being free with family or friends. He also talks to his camera, filming what's he thinking. Aron is depicted as being some what cocky in the beginning. He seems to think he can climb rocks and go down ravines with ease and not be worried since he was by himself. I wonder if that how the real guy was. The only other characters are 2 girls he meets at the beginning and they go swimming in this cool water hole.FINAL VERDICT: Not enough oomph for me. I say skip it.",,Anonymous,Biography
"When you think you're having a ""bad day"", remember Aron Ralston","I love Aron's story, whether via his book, ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"", or movie adaptation. The movie, ""127 Hours"", starring James Franco, dramatizes his determination to survive, learn, overcome the horrific obstacles in his way, and realize his dream to live a full, happy, life in spite of his horrific experience. His eagerness to understand, accept, embrace, and teach others how he was meant to be in the exact spot, in Blue John Canyon, and hold himself responsible for his past: loves, experiences, struggles, hopes, faith, forgiveness, and a renewed sense of letting people into his life, appreciating them, and an incredible willingness to survive. His experience has inspired me and my daughter in so many ways. James Franco's portrayal of Aron appears to be incredibly genuine. The relevance and significance of the cutaways. The flashbacks of water dripping, negligently, from a faucet in his apartment, his new friends, an invitation to a party where there were snacks and other cold beverages he dreamed of having, while projecting himself at the party in a ""dream state"", his memories of camping trips when he was a kid and the fun he had while on them (especially spending time with his dad). As well as the visions he has of those who love him and are looking for him.The scene where Aron's driving to his camp destination, and he makes direct eye-contact with a street cyclist, on the road, is haunting. Such an inspiring, true, story. Thank you for making the film, and thank you to Aron Ralston, and his family, for sharing such a difficult and inspiring story.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
127 hours,"This movie is in my top 50 and it deserves it. Being a scout I've always been interested in survival and stuff like that so this film ticked all the boxes for me. When I first watched this film I felt as though I was watching the real Aron Ralston trapped under that rock, it was very realistic. Its so accurate that even Aron himself said so. Furthermore James Franco's performance in this film is outstanding it was as if in it he was cutting his own actual arm off.I would recommend this to anyone who has seen and enjoyed films like alive and other survival films.

No Fool Like A Young Fool,"While cavorting in the desert, Aron Ralston slips down a crevasse, finding that his right arm is pinned by a large rock to the side of a boulder. There's no cell phone service and no one knows he's there. This movie was not filmed in real time; it only seems that way: the title removes any suspense. How he makes it out, not when, is at issue. Tricky split screens, flashbacks and hallucinations are relied upon for entertainment. Ralston is unwise, but we're bound to admire his pluck. Ironically, the top credited female is the granddaughter of an owner of the New York Giants and the great granddaughter of the founder/owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers.

"Franco is the star, not the film","Danny Boyle blazed on to the awards circuit two years ago with his Best Picture winner ""Slumdog Millionaire."" Boyle took no prisoners tearing through the awards season taking gold after gold. There was lots of anticipation for his follow up film ""127 Hours,"" based on the true story of Aron Ralston, a young man who gets his arm caught under a boulder in Utah. The premise and promise made it sound like a sure-fire winner. Unfortunately, the films falters and falls a bit flat in execution. Boyle walks a fine line between artistic choices and cinematic overkill; he crosses the line a time or two. What saves the film is the undeniable remarkable work of James Franco. This is the best solo principal casted work since Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away"" back in 2000. What Franco achieves here is an uplifting of the human spirit and an utter submerge into a character of epic proportions.Though Danny Boyle's direction and Simon Beaufoy's script are not the brightest things the two has placed on the screen, the story itself is worth the admiration and enough to place itself on this year's ""must-see"" list.***/***",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Between a rock and a hard place,"""Danny Boyle"" shows himself as a respectable director with this film. And intelligence and interest in choosing such a subject is appreciated. With this film, he is on the list of my favorite directors whose work I follow. The film is very suitable between concept and form. The content of the movie is correct and intelligent. It is not possible to propose a specific form for the film. Although the film tries to take advantage of the documentary model in its structure, I read the "" boyle's"" film form. I still believe that at the Oscars, this film was more deserving of receiving the best film than ""The King's Speech"". A precise and calculated performance by ""James Franco"" in the role of ""Aron Ralston"" is an admirable point in the film. The acting is believable and this is a difficult task that ""Franco"" has done in this film. The most interesting concept of the film for me is the emphasis on imagination and reference to memories. Man lives with imagination, and Aron gives himself life again with his imagination in perhaps the most difficult time of his life. The film removes the border between reality and imagination and sees life as the result of imagining to achieve reality. His unceasing effort definitely has a message hidden in it for all people and it points out the secret of success and victory.",,Anonymous,Biography
Second-Tier But Still Great 2010 Film,"Aron Ralston (James Franco) is an amateur mountain climber. After setting out on his own, and not telling anyone where he went, he finds himself in the most awful of tragedies: his arm is trapped under a rock, and there is no possible way to call for help. What lengths will he go to in order to survive?The story is familiar to anyone who has followed the news in the last ten years. But here we are given a closer look than we ever thought possible. And if you are wondering if it is possible to make a film about a man who does not move and has no one to talk to for 127 hours, it can be done, and be done in style.I do not think Danny Boyle was the right man for the job on this one. Not to say he did a bad job -- he did not -- but he has a unique style that I think this film did not need. There are a lot of colorful things that need not be there. Some may like this.I also do not think Franco was given a full range to work with. That being said, I would still give him a best actor nomination, even if he would not win. It is not often that one man can carry a whole film, and he did it. He had to, and he did. I never got bored despite the very limited scenery.This is a bit more of an artsy film and will not gain the amount of attention that other films -- ""Inception"" and ""Social Network"" -- will get. And it is not Boyle's best film, certainly. But if you have an urge to see Boyle's latest film, or one of the top films of 2010, make this a must-see.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Danny Boyle's ""Cast Away"".","One question: what happens when director Danny Boyle, who made the classic zombie movie ""28 days later"" and the gripping drama ""Slumdog Millionaire"", decides to make a biopic of the climber Aron Ralston based on a book that himself wrote? Perhaps one of the best cinematic experiences that someone will have in a movie.For those who don't know the story on which the film was based on, here is a small synopsis here: Aron Ralston (James Franco) is a simple professional mountaineer who plans to one day do canyoning in the Grand Canyon National Park (canyoning » Canyon, get it?) in Utah. When he is climbing through a narrow passage in the middle of the mountain, Aron slips on a loose rock and falls in the middle of the hole with the same rock trapping his right arm. Aron tries to push the stone but fails, cries for help and also fails. Now Aron will have to try to survive and escape that hole before his food and water finish, and he ends up having to amputate his own arm with a blunt penknife.Hell, we can almost say that this film is Danny Boyle's ""Cast Away"", only that is located in the Grand Canyon and it doesn't has no coconut called Wilson, only James Franco in a hole, with only two or three other secondary characters. Many may think that this can be boring or tedious, but as I said before, Boyle gives us an unforgettable experience.""But how the hell 94 minutes of James Franco in a hole can be interesting?"". Well, I don't know, maybe the good script of Boyle and Simon Beaufoy maintaining a great line of realism in the story with well-written and even reflective monologues with the character of Aron talking to himself recording everything by its own camera. But what Boyle really makes is literally put ourselves in Aron's place. Not only doing he a relatable character, thanks to an outstanding performance from Franco, but showing what any human being would do in that situation, since scream, cry, think and then later, hallucinate.The parts of hallucination were (and are) a target of criticism from the public, saying that it is where the film fails exaggerating the story, but it is exactly the opposite. When Boyle focuses attention on those moments of hallucination is exactly when he puts us in Aron's place. I mean, how many times we humble humans are with nothing to do, we imagine situations with ourselves and fill our minds with thoughts and memories. Giving himself a chance to show another magnificent direction, both in the flashbacks and memories, but also making us feel the claustrophobia and asphyxiation of the hole with a beautiful cinematography.In short, ""127 Hours"" is an experience with mandatory viewing at least once in your lives, and believe me, it will be worth it. From a magnificent direction, good script, and (finally) a performance worthy of an Oscar from James Franco makes ""127 Hours"" not only one of the best films of Boyle, but also an unforgettable experience.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A potentially profound adventure handled like it wasn't. (Just not bad),"Aron Ralston is trapped in a canyon in Arizona with his arm wedged between the canyon wall and a boulder. He has half a bottle of water, a pair of wire cutters, a video camera, and nobody around to hear him.considering the hype for this film and the intensity of the premise, I was a little disappointed at the execution. To put it as literally as I can, director Danny Boyle takes a story that is potentially terrifying and he turns it into a music video. It moves too fast and contains disorienting flashbacks, clumsy cuts, over exaggerated music ques, and misuse of split screening. There is little sense of subjectivity or patience to the film. It shows a lack of faith in the attention span of its audience.James Franco is easily more vibrant than anything in his previous career, but he doesn't embody the character as well as I had hoped. I didn't sense the desperation of the situation in his performance. He plays it quiet when it should be loud, and sometimes vice versa. Another problem with the character is that Boyle cuts around him too much.As many mistakes as I felt Boyle made, He hasn't yet disappointed me as a photographer. Sunshine, Slumdog Millionaire, and even The Beach (which was slop) were vibrant and well shot. 127 Hours is easily the most vibrant of them all, making effective use of colour temperature, scope, and camera angles. One angle in particular worth noting is the intimacy of being inside Aron's video camera. There is also a memorable moment where we follow a rusty tool as it digs into his bloodstream. This brings me to my next point.The much discussed arm cutting scene is seriously over hyped. I can name a dozen films that will make you more squeamish. Therefore, if this is the reason you've chosen to avoid 127 Hours then it's the wrong reason. A better reason might be to mark me when I tell you that it's a rather miscalculated experience, good in parts but too shallow and flashy for its own good.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Gripping, Gorgeous and Intimate Story with James Franco at his A-game","I stayed away from this movie for a long time, for the most obvious reason; I have a weak stomach and for anyone who knows this story ends, they might imagine why this movie is not for me. I decided to take a leap of faith, and watched it anyway. Despite it taking place in mostly one location, with only one character, this movie is so well written, shot and acted that you just keep watching. That makes including the end well worth it(still can't quite handle it).Acting:
James Franco as Aaron Ralston is absolutely great. Having to carry a movie all by yourself is a daunting task, but Franco does it effortlessly, providing a wide range of extreme emotions like fear, anger, depression, humor and joy at all the right moments. At the most difficult scenes he is so good that it is hard to believe that he is not actually going through all this.Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn as the two girls Aaron meets at the start are allright. Off course being in such a short portion of the movie, they can't show off that much, but are still quite delightful.The same goes for the handful of actors that appears in Aaron's flashbacks and visions; they all sell what they need to sell. Some deleted scenes give extra opportunity for this, and particulary Lizzy Caplan shines at these small moments.Direction:
Danny Boyle is known for his professionalism with actors and visuals, and always delivers on solid characters and their development. This is no exception. He always stays close to Aaron and makes sure that we feel just as trapped and desperate as he is. The use of flashbacks and hallucinations is also smoothly done, with peculiar choiches for lighting and camera position. It ensures that every such scene conveys a certain feeling that feels very different from the canyon we spend most of the time in.Cinematography:
This movie is gorgeous to watch; everything has a warm yellow haze over it, perfectly for the desert setting, contrasted with a deep, cold blue that makes you long for water and the outside world that Aaron can't reach. The use of lens flares is beautiful, and of spotlights imitating the slowly rising sun every day in the canyon. In regards to the position of the shots, a hand-held camera(from the real Aaron Ralston)is used to great effect to truly convey the slow decent into despair that Aaron experiences. Shaky-cam is used just as much as steadycam at the right moments to portray the emotional (in)stability at the right moments.Plot:
Guy gets trapped under a boulder in the lonely desert, and needs to get out or he'll die. How does he do that? It is not much to build a movie on, but the execution is done as well as possibly could. We first get a comfortable set-up, only to suddenly introduce the major inciting incident. The second act consists of attempts of Aaron freeing himself, intercut with his own tape-recordings and flashbacks, which add greatly to his character for his psyche and resourcefullness. The third act....well let's just say that it is one of the most difficult scenes to watch that you will ever encounter. It is greatly cathartic once you'll get through however, and by the end you feel just as relieved that the whole ordeal is behind Aaron.Music:
This movie has a very versatile soundtrack, with a lot of different styles and songs, used to great effect. Not sure if I would listen to it in my free time, but one or two songs definitely might appear on my playlist.Editing:
This is the hidden pillar of support of this movie: if this aspect fails, this movie would get boring very quickly. Through montages, flashbacks, hallucinations and all such things, intercut with Aaron in the canyon, the movie stays fresh most of the time and each time something new is revealed about the protagonist in a way we haven't seen before.Make-up:
The toll that the long time and malnourishment takes on Aaron is done very subtle and effective; his face pales, bags under his eyes, dry lips. The make-up department did a really good job for the little work that had to be done. Considering the trapped arm: even better. You believe what is happening to that arm. That is the highest praise I can give.Tone:
This movie is filled with adrenaline, even when the scene doesn't involve such things at all; it is because of the underlying knowledge that we know what eventually Aaron might be forced to do, and every minute takes us closer to that moment. Besides that, this movie is surprisingly effective in giving strong emotion and empathy for Aaron as we learn more about him and what brought the circumstances together that caused him to end up here.General Concensus:Despite its very simple premise and setting, Danny Boyle's approach and Franco's performance make this a wonderful experience, all the while backed up by a sense of impending dread and fear, culminating in an explosive finale.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Doesn't quite hit the heights expected,"It is no easy task reviewing a film of this nature. For one, the story is already known and is a very, very real one. This gives those intending to watch it the knowledge that for the best part of an hour and a half it is going to be a bloke stuck with a big rock on his arm. For another it is a single set, single actor set up for the vast majority and in the wrong hands could be a total nightmare. These are inhibitions that the film is going to have to overcome even before it has been viewed.It was with this in mind that I made the decision to watch 127 Hours after having it for a good couple of months. Upon initial viewing I found little of interest in the film and my fears seemed to have been well placed. It was as I have said above - bloke stuck with a big rock on his arm. But I have found that it is one of those rare breed of films that plays on your mind and grows in your affections over time.So what is good about it. The performance that Boyle has managed to get from James Franco is testament to his skill as a director and Franco's as an actor.Franco has impressed me with his performances of late. Milk, Howl (dreadful film, great performance) and Pineapple Express are all splendid and he was very much the right person for the job here. The character he plays is, to me at least, pretty unlikeable. He was selfish, arrogant and careless. Yet through sharing in his unthinkable experience a sense of empathy is developed; the regrets of his life are played out leading to a degree of realisation and repentance. Whether this will change his attitude in the future is another matter entirely but there is hope for him that he will learn from his mistakes and become a better person. At its heart, therefore, its a tale of redemption and are we not all seeking this?! The nuances of the personality are all conveyed by an actor in his prime tasked with an extremely difficult proposition - one set, limited mobility, no other actors around. Franco deserves plaudits for this performance and this aspect alone is worth the majority of my grading.As always, Danny Boyle's direction was spot on. The difficulties of such a film were met head on and the story develops at a solid pace. The photography is impressive, the locations kind of do the hard work but it looks lovely on film. The soon to be famous last scene in the crevice is very realistic and not something for the weak stomached! It is an impressive translation of the story.So why only 7 out of 10? Well to be honest Id probably give it 7.5 but IMDb is a silly so I cant. It wasn't quite perfect. As I said, it was only after viewing that the story really started to hit me. I may watch it again to see if this delayed development translates into increased enjoyment but this is unlikely. It is not the type of film that has repeated viewing qualities. It will never be considered a classic but what it is is a solid film, impressively acted and skillfully directed. When history looks back on Boyle's portfolio of work I would say this would rank well behind Trainspotting, Shallow Grave, 28 Days Later and Slumdog all of which are 8-10 star films. For this reason I have judged it as I have!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great tale of how amazingly strong the human spirit is,"127 hours is a movie about the human spirit. This is not a dynamic, action-filled movie with a lot of cgi. This movie is tame, it settles in your brain slowly and is damn good at this.The film is shot in almost only one location and with almost only one actor - the incredible James Franco in his maybe best performance in his career. The editing and Danny Boyle's directing is very smart, different from the majority of the movies. The cinematography for me is the biggest weapon 127 hours has. The cinematography is terrific with shot of the Utah canyons like i have never seen before, shots from the bottom of Aaron's bottle, the absolutely disgusting (but great) shot of him slowly drinking his urine from the bag. This is the films strongest part. And also James Franco - his acting was great, given that he didn't have anyone to work with, acting alone and with almost no lines. What that guy did was awesome. I like him since Pineapple Express but I think this is his top.There are however some thing that were not as good. The music was kinda like I was watching some kind of a comedy movie, especially at the end, it really took the emotional impact it must had on the viewer. The scene with the arm was extremely overhyped too. I saw comments that it was one of the most brutal and realistic things ever on film, but it was just some average gore and not that impactful and brutal at all. The hype was just TOO MUCH. The flashback scenes although good were not important enough, they didn't shape the character of Franco, which at the end was almost the same guy we came to know from the beginning.Apart from these not so serious flaws 127 hours was a very good movie, with amazing story about human survival and will, played perfectly by James Franco and a movie I will watch again sometime.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Can Someone Lend James Franco a Hand?,"Man goes hiking. Man gets pinned in canyon by boulder. Man cuts own arm off to save himself. Man lives. End of story.That's all there is to ""127 Hours,"" and director/writer Danny Boyle and co-writer Simon Beaufoy aren't able to make it about much of anything else. James Franco plays the man, and we feel bad for him in the way a normal human being would feel bad for any other human being in a similar situation. But we certainly don't feel invested in him as a character, because the material doesn't allow Franco to create one. There are some flashbacks that give us a peek into the man's life before the accident, and it's from these that we are to absorb the film's trite moral lessons (things like you should appreciate the people you love more and shouldn't take a single day for granted). But really the whole movie is really just build-up to the money shot scene, when Franco's character saws off his arm, which is admittedly pretty hard to watch but isn't really the hook on which to hang an entire movie.Boyle typically over-directs the film to within an inch of its life. The director he most reminds me of is Joel Schumacher, which -- trust me -- is not a compliment. He clearly doesn't think we as his audience have the intelligence or attention span to stick with a story that takes place in such static settings, so keeps the film constantly jittering along in a way that distracts us from the story rather than enhancing it. The only time I enjoyed his hyperactive style was during the kick-ass opening credits sequence.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
How can this movie rate below Avatar?!,"Seriously i just don't understand this. Why is a movie with such an amazing acting gets such low ratings, and yet a movie with minimal acting and cartoon CGIs gets higher rating than this movie? What happened to the traditions of appreciating a movie? Is it gone?First of all, I love the way James Franco acts in this. He has the ability to connect with the audience. With restricted movements, all James Franco can make this movie a huge success is by his emotions, in which he did it flawlessly.Solid 9, could have given a 10 but still thinks this movie can do better. P/s: i only give a 10 to perfect movies. :)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It's a very good movie, but I don't think I'll watch it again.","I have heard of this story about the mountain climber who was forced to cut off his own arm in order to survive. I knew how it would end but I felt it's time to see how it all happened and the events that led to him doing what he did.James Franco is really good in his role as Aron Ralston and carries this movie all by himself. This film is not only about a man who cuts off his arm to survive, but also about the reason why he does it. It was interesting. I was also constantly curious as to what he would try next, and he had some really good ideas. This film is an experience that you get to share with the character. For us it's only 90 minutes, but for him it's 127 hours.Then when it's time for the scene when it happens, I found it very difficult to continue watching. I've seen a lot of gore in other movies, but there was something about this scene that made it extra hard. Probably because this was something he had to do to himself, but also because the scene was very well done. James Franco's fantastic acting, the visuals, the sound effects and the editing of this gruesome amputation. First he breaks the bones in his arm so it becomes easier to cut it off. All of this was so well done.This is a true story, and the real Aron Ralston has said it is very true to what happened. It's a very good movie, but I don't think I'll watch it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Film.,"It's hard for a movie about one guy in one place for an hour and a half to be interesting and not boring for an audience, but I honestly think this film did a great job at keeping a steady pace and not really ever becoming boring. Despite the lack of multiple characters or any real engaging dialogue. There's times where it may drag in truth, but the tension and anticipation keep you on your feet the whole time. In my opinion.I loved the whole way the first act is played out and how when he gets stuck the title appears and the movie really starts. Thats when I was like, ""ohhhh, okay."" The film was honestly really realistic and at times disturbing. I definitely wanted to look away. Iykyk.Extremely well acted by James Franco and great directing by Danny Boyle. Probably James Franco's most well acted film? Either way, they were the two stars of the film. There was really great imagery and cinematography used as well, to make us understand and feel when he's dehydrated or hallucinating etc. I thought that was really cool. Made me thirsty.Overall, I think 127 Hours was a great film. The soundtrack? Wow, so many bangers, I was delightfully surprised. The SOUND and the EDITING. Really make this whole film an experience. It's the sound effects man. That whole scene where ""it"" happens. The sound is so intense it just enhances the cringe. Really great filmmaking for a very uncomfortable scene. But, in all honesty, I might not watch it again anytime soon, but it's definitely worth it at least once. The whole movie is very tense, especially if you go into it knowing whats going to end up happening. Its definitely an experience. You're really rooting for him the whole time.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A great survival story,"This film, with direction and script by Danny Boyle, tells the story of Aron Ralston, an adventurer who gets trapped in a canyon after a heavy rock crushing his hand. Based on real facts, written by true Ralston in his book ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"", this film deals with the theme of survival and loneliness, trying to show how far can a man go when he's alone and needs to survive. Featuring James Franco as protagonist.Its an intense film, where the audience is clinging to several attempts that the character does to get rid of the situation, potentially fatal, which inadvertently ended. However, the absence of a larger plot (only broken by mental flashbacks that show us the character's thoughts) ends up making this movie too stopped, and it would be a bit boring if not for the extraordinary soundtrack and the sense of danger that surrounds all action, since the moment Ralston falls into the gully. The interpretation of Franco is very good: the actor managed to give his character the psychological aspect of a man in utter despair. For all this, the film was nominated for six Oscars (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score and Best Original Song for the song ""If I Rise"") and three Golden Globes (Best Dramatic Actor, Best Film Screenplay and Best Original Score).",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
That's a shocking film,"First of all, when I first watched the official teaser of the movie I liked it and I had high expectations about it. Eventually, it was as good as I had imagined and I enjoyed it. The plot of the movie was very interesting and it was based on real events. The storyline was well-written, well-explained and everything was accurate. The main character was very interesting, well-developed and likeable. I have to admit, James Franco's acting was incredible and I really enjoyed his performance. The opening scene of the movie was kinda unpredictable and very promising. The 2nd act was very intense and full of breathtaking moments. The ending scene was kinda unpredictable and very emotionally intense. In my opinion, it's definitely one of the most shocking survival movies I have ever seen. Moreover, the cinematography and the score of the movie were both very well done and unique. Overall, ""127 Hours"" was an amazing survival film, very intense, fast-paced, kinda gruesome sometimes and I would definitely recommend it to anyone!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"127 Hours: Inconsequential, Inconclusive, and Disappointing","It's difficult, around this time of year, to maintain one's cynicism toward awards ceremonies. So many major winners of the last decade have, to me, seemed so horridly overrated that it is difficult to lend any credence to an Oscar nomination anymore. Nonetheless, I was drawn into the premise of 127 Hours: the prospect of a single setting, and the ever likable James Franco.A true-life story of climber/canyoneer Aron Ralston, 127 Hours follows the character as he sets out for the weekend to Blue John canyon. Having told nobody where he is going, Ralston intends to fully enjoy the escapism the wilderness brings. This self-imposed isolation becomes a burden, however, when he finds himself trapped, a fallen boulder crushing his arm against a crevasse wall.The praise heaped upon writer/director Danny Boyle following his previous effort Slumdog Millionaire is indelibly related to the cynicism mentioned above. Slumdog, for me, was a perfectly fine film, but in no way deserving of such championing. Boyle's position as director was something of a bad omen as such, leaving me slightly worried about what might happen with the film. These worries appear justified almost immediately, Boyle splitting the screen to a triptych (though technically not) showing large crowds of people. This carries on for almost ten minutes, the broken screen fine for a credit sequence but rapidly tired-out and overused almost immediately after. Thankfully it subsides eventually, allowing us to take in the wonderful setting of the film. The vast canyon expanse is quite, quite beautiful, given appropriate treatment with wide angle lenses. It is fewer than twenty minutes before Ralston becomes trapped, the trailer-featured scenes with two female fellow adventurers apparently consisting of the entirety of their presence in the film. Not that I'm complaining, mind; sitting in a canyon with James Franco was what I paid to do. And Franco is wonderful, his performance carrying the film exactly as it needs to. One moment in particular, immediately after Ralston's hallucinatory imagining of a talk show, demonstrates perfectly Franco's humanity in this role. Unfortunately, Boyle seems to have insufficient confidence in entrusting the entirety of the film to the strength of Franco's performance, and consequentially we are left with regular flashbacks, imagined party scenes, bizarre appearances of Scooby Doo, and agonisingly infuriating gimmicky camera-work. It seems as though the film is trying to add a layer of quirky geekiness to its effects, and these prove little more than distracting and deprecating, leaving us with fewer moments of pure performance. An additional qualm comes in the form of Ralston's character as expressed in the film. I found his story inescapably comparable to that of Christopher McCandless, the inspiration behind Sean Penn's infinitely superior Into the Wild. Unlike Into the Wild, 127 Hours does not manage to build itself a protagonist with sufficient depth of characterisation to craft a meaningful message, resigning itself instead to the status of mere story. We emerge from 127 Hours with little on our minds to consider, save the reuse of that damned triptych effect.Though its star delivers a very fine performance—when the director has faith enough to allow him to perform, that is—127 Hours just seems inconsequential, inconclusive, and disappointing. This is the sort of film from which one should take home a message of sorts, but the thinly-sketched and unconflicted character at its heart prevents any such meaningfulness. Oddly enough, it's this film's potential which drags it down.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
James Franco makes it ALIVE.,"127 Hours is the latest movie by Danny Boyle (Known for 28 days later, Slummdog Millionaire, Trainspotting, and Sunshine) which delivers fine content. The movie is based on a true story of Aron Ralston who was stuck in rocks for more than 5 days. The story is very fine and editing, cinematography (actual), and Performance by James Franco is excellent and must be given accolades. James Franco has always delivered fine performances in all of his films I have seen.The movie is far from perfection. The direction(which is fine), screenplay and camera handling (OMG what were they thinking? Cloverfeild 2? No offense to anyone but I found that decreasing the quality of the movie, IMO this is the worst flaw of the movie) is not the strongest parts of the movie. Screenplay tries to make intense scenes emotional but fails. Music by Oscar winner AR Rehman is sweet to hear BUT it doesn't actually suits the movie at many sequences, therefore I would not be surprised if it doesn't get Oscar Nomination for Original Score. Screenplay, Simon Beaufy who won Oscar for Slummdog Millionaire again gives a mediocre screenplay (still better than Slummdog Millionaire's Screenplay).Overall, The movie is fine and I don't think that it will get Best Picture Oscar Nomination nor the Best director, Original Score or screenplay Nods.Editing, James Franco are 2 things which IMO will get nominations out of which, James Franco really deserves that.I am gonna rate it 7 out of 10. Interesting true story but flawed due to major contents. we all have seen and Loved ""Into The Wild"" which is also a true story but a far better movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Top Notch Survival Tale,"Right near the top of its class when it comes to survival movies. What a story of survival instinct. Aron Ralston realized he had made a mistake, but he didn't succumb to it. He was able to persevere, dig deep, and did what was necessary in order to go on and live a very full life afterwards.Danny Boyle did an incredible job bringing the viewer back to the year 2003, from the music to the technology, and overall lingo. The scenery was remarkable. His ability to build an engaging story with someone being stuck in one position the entire time shows his talent. Of course, James Franco deserves a huge amount of credit as well. His best work that I've seen him do and I'm writing this eleven years since the movie came out. The word visceral comes to mind when trying to describe how Ralston's predicament is portrayed. The camera work combined with Franco's acting makes one feel as if they can actually understand in some small degree what Ralston had to go through.As long you can stomach a few intense, graphic scenes this is a must watch for at least one viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Awesome Story,This was one of the most greatest movies i've ever seen .A tremendous story with an incredible drama that really puts you and you can relate to it even though you never had an experience like that. Where the points of survival are seen and an inspiring story with a young men with an awesome adventure who likes challenges .A great true story and a incredible performance by James Franco which I definitely think was worth it to win an Oscar but only stayed nominated.Through the movie you see everything 1. A very tough man who's trying to get out of there 2. A desperate man who misses his family 3. A sad man who realizes he's been mean to his family and friends and everyone who starts to learn from his mistakes and 4. A man who cuts himself does this and that drinks urine does everything which I would define it a man with a BraveHeart .Don't miss this one it's a great movie :) I give it 9.7 out 10 :) Keep up with the good work JamesFranco . :D,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Boring mostly + too many frills,"When your entire cast is basically one person and when the entire movie is just one incident it is difficult to make it interesting enough or entertaining enough. That said i did not enjoy 127 hours much. Yes it is interesting in parts especially in the beginning and towards the end. Some of the scenes seemed like they were added simply to increase the lenght of the movie and that really doesn't work.As far as the director goes i personally think that danny boyle is overrated. slumdog billionaire is an ordinary movie,it has some substance but for the most mart it doesn't deserve the credit it got.The music in 127 hours is good but not great. The camera work is too flashy. flash works in bits but it is certainly overdone here.Finally James Franco delivers a good performance which makes the movie worth a watch",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
James Franco is just wow,"James Franco gives a standout performance as Aron Ralston, capturing the character's bravery, determination, and vulnerability with nuance and depth. The film is essentially a one-man show, with Franco carrying the story for the majority of the runtime, and he does so with impressive skill and conviction.Boyle's direction is also noteworthy, as he employs a variety of stylistic techniques to keep the film visually interesting and engaging. From the use of split-screen to represent Ralston's internal thoughts and emotions, to the dynamic camerawork and editing that convey the frantic urgency of the situation, Boyle infuses the film with energy and vitality.One of the film's most powerful moments comes towards the end, as Ralston makes the excruciating decision to amputate his own arm in order to free himself from the boulder. The scene is depicted with unflinching realism, and is both gut-wrenching and awe-inspiring in equal measure.Overall, ""127 Hours"" is a riveting and emotionally resonant film that tells a remarkable story of human endurance and the will to survive. It is not for the faint of heart, but for those willing to take the journey, it is a truly unforgettable cinematic experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Every Second Counts,"127 HOURS is the true story of mountain climber Aron Ralston's remarkable adventure to save himself after a fallen boulder crashes on his arm and traps him in an isolate canyon in Utah. (Fox Searchlight)127 HOURS may seem like a mix of SAW and BURIED, the latter which was recently released to theaters, but, honestly, I have to say that it's more gut wrenching than SAW and more emotionally draining than BURIED, although I'm not trying to say both of those films are bad. It just puts you right into a harrowing situation and never lets you go until the end, but you'll be glad you stayed through. As much as it is a hard film to sit through, the film is mainly about hope and the will to survive, which I like because I'm not a pessimistic person.James Franco gives the performance of his career and carries the film really well on his shoulders, which is a good thing considering we're with him for the rest of the film. Although Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn, two lovely actresses, have short roles in the film, it's always nice to see them. The editing plays a huge role in the film as well. It has a similar eccentric visual style like director Danny Boyle's previous film, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE.Overall, Danny Boyle does it once again, proving everybody that he's one of the few fantastic directors out there working in the film industry, along with Christopher Nolan and Quentin Tarantino. Franco gives a terrific performance and the film is both gripping and emotional until the very end.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Push it to the limit,"In 127 Hours, we follow Ralston, played by James Franco, a person who lives life to the fullest and on his terms. His lifestyle pushes others away, but for him that's okay, a choice that will haunt him. While taking a weekend trip to Blue John Canyon, Ralston finds himself in the precarious situation of having his arm wedged under a boulder. With limited supplies, Ralston must find the best way out of this mess, all the while ensuring his survival. With some rope, tethers, a cheap multi-tool, and headlamp, he goes through trial after trial of attempting to free his arm.Entering the film, I was curious as to the techniques Boyle would employ to keep us invested. After all, watching a guy under a rock for five days sounds like an Andy Warhol film. I was expecting to see cutaways to people who would be looking for him. We soon find out that no one knows he is there. Then I realized that Boyle's angle is to put us in that canyon trapped under the very same boulder. Our only advantage over Ralston is that we can move freely in our seats pain free, though we go through each event be it drinking water, urinating, stretching for sunlight, or doing the unthinkable of removing one's limb.By putting us in the canyon, our minds start to race, much like Ralston. His only escape is through his camcorder with which he documents his time, and with his endless parade of thoughts and memories, both good and bad. Imagine having that much time by yourself and the flood of memories and emotions that would creep into your head. It's mind boggling and borderline disorienting to think about. Through Franco's performance we see how this forced isolation influences ones thoughts so much.Franco, much like the boulder on top of his arm, is rock solid throughout the film. The opening sequences show his free spirited nature and inability to stay on the ground let alone in one place. He whizzes around the canyon, confident with every step and every peddle of his bicycle. Once trapped in the canyon, he is confined to staying put, something his character is not used to. Franco was so convincing that I forgot about the character and focused on my own emotions. He did many of the things I saw myself doing with the same expressions. As the film progresses we feel every emotion and sense every sensation.To help with this process, Boyle employs creative camera shots, sound effects, and editing techniques. Due to the cramped space, Boyle puts the camera in virtually every crevice and height imaginable, including shots from inside his water bottle and even one inside his arm. Each movement is accompanied by a slew of sounds that intensify and bombard our senses. One in particular utilizes an electric guitar buzz when Ralston attempts at severing a nerve. Cut all of this with editing straight from a Jason Bourne film and you have an intense, dramatic sequence of events that keeps the audience engaged.On an estimated budget of around 18 million dollars, Boyle utilizes his leading actor, Franco, his beautiful locations in Utah, and an incredible arsenal of editing points, coverage shots, and foley artistry to create a portrait of a lone man pushed to the edge. Like so many of Boyle's characters, they are presented with an obstacle, be it a zombie onslaught or a game show, and we are able to see how the choices they make both in the present situation and in their prior experiences influence and determine their ultimate outcome.Ralston is confronted with the idea of his entire life's journey has led him to this rock at this time and in this place, leading to the conclusion that everything happens for a reason. As for Boyle, we're all thankful for the path he has chosen.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nobody to blame but himself,"The real Aron Ralston has admitted this and it's unfortunately true. He didn't notify anyone that he was going hiking alone one time in 2003, where he accidentally had his arm pinned by a boulder in a canyon for five days, and ended up amputating the arm to escape. This is indeed what Danny Boyle's remarkable ""127 Hours"" is about. It's one of the very best films I've seen so far this year.It begins with Aron, played excellently by James Franco, in his home getting ready for that unbeknownst life changing experience. We see split screens, people running a marathon in fast motion, and other fast motion cinematography that resembles the documentary ""Koyaanisqatsi"". There's even similar rock art briefly shown. (Could it be the same?) I don't know if there's a purpose for this surreal style Boyle has chosen to open the film with, which is occasionally used for the rest of it, but maybe it's to make your viewing experience and Aron's experience to sometimes feel like a dream. In other words, what's happening to Aron shouldn't be happening, but it is, of course. In any case, I loved the style and the cinematography in general is stunning, but particularly of the canyon and desert. Say, those are more ""Koyaanisqatsi"" resemblances.As Aron travels through the desert and canyon, he meets two young women who are lost. He guides them and soon departs. This is the last time he comes in contact with anyone before and during the period of being trapped. A boulder crushes his arm in between canyon walls and he has to survive with the few supplies he has, like a bottle of water and some food. He's saddened, dehydrated, hungry, remorseful, bored, you get the idea. The film turns not much happening into cinematic genius. We feel empathetic for him, engage in what he does and thinks about, like his past, and we imagine that we'd never ever want to be in his position. The film has a neat bag of tricks to show. There are fantasy sequences, like Aron escaping to his ex-girlfriend. He creates a talk show with himself since he brought a video camera, complete with audience responses. I guess it was made for black humour, but I hardly felt like laughing. Of course, he occasionally tries to escape. He uses pocket pliers with a dull knife to chip away at the boulder, but doesn't make progress. In the end, he has no choice but to amputate his arm. It's a particularly powerful and somewhat squeamish scene. I've read that audience members have fainted and have even required medical assistance. I was OK with the scene since I'm used to gory things in horror films and nobody in the theatre I was in fainted. As he's being rescued, I almost felt like crying. The glorious music is partly why. Aron has made it.I honestly cannot think of any flaws with this film. Aron is portrayed as a likable guy who obviously made a very bad mistake. The reason isn't explained, but maybe it's because he's just a little arrogant. Nothing about the film is pretentious, though. It reminds me of ""Into the Wild"" and Gus Van Sant's ""Gerry"", which I both love, although ""Gerry"" is an acquired taste, for lack of a better term. I swear there's a resemblance in ""127 Hours"" with a flashback of Aron's friend on a different boulder that he mysteriously climbed up. Actually, I think he has the proper equipment, unlike Casey Affleck's character in ""Gerry"", but it's still interesting to note.""127 Hours"" is Oscar worthy, particularly for Best Picture. The film is another high point in Danny Boyle's career, along with ""Trainspotting"" and ""Slumdog Millionaire"". (He likes making different films, doesn't he?) I've decided ""127 Hours"" is also one of my favourite films. I admit I know little about the real Aron Ralston, but he's shown not as a hero, but a survivor.",,Anonymous,Biography
Another interesting(and excellent) film from Danny Boyle,"I have enjoyed Danny Boyle's work, though I found myself let down by Sunshine, so naturally I was all for seeing 127 Hours. I thought it was excellent and very interestingly done. I think the movie could have been a tad longer, but that in mind, 127 Hours is a superb-looking movie, definitely one of the best-looking and impressive movies of 2010 in my eyes. I just loved the wonderful cinematography and landscapes and also the kinetic editing and visual effects. The story is compelling and well paced, beautifully put together by well staged and thoughtfully thought out flashbacks and hallucinations. The music is fitting and dynamic, the conclusion is harrowing and I think heart-wrenching and a lot of effort is taken into making the audience empathise with Ralston. Other than the technical aspects, what really stood out about 127 Hours was Boyle's superb direction, it is wonderfully tight throughout, and the mesmerising tour-de-force that is James Franco's lead performance.

Great view on one man's adventure and his survival,"127 Hours shows how you should not go on an adventure. When you decide to go on a trip alone and to a place where you don't have any phone range, let someone know where you're going and how long you'll be gone. It can help you save your life. When you're lost or in this case, trapped in a canyon.127 Hours tells the true story of a young man who got trapped under a boulder in the remote and deserted canyon somewhere near Moab in Utah. Aron Ralston – extremely well portrayed by James Franco – is a professional mountain climber and adventurer. He goes almost every weekend on a solo trip without letting anyone know where he goes. Along with his equipment Aron's on his way to a trip that will change his perspective completely.In the beginning everything is good. He takes preparations for his trip and when he finally arrives at his destination it looks pretty amazing! The film shows us how wonderful that place is – Moab, Utah – and gives a perfect view of a hidden pool! To me it also looks kind of dangerous, since the place looks the same which makes it easy to get lost. But for Aron that's no problem, it looks like he has been there more than once. But like I said, everything looks fine. The weather is amazing, Aron is in a very good mood and we got to see a very beautiful landscape. Along the way he meets two girls – Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn) – who are a bit lost in their quest to find a hidden pool. As the gentleman he is, Aron guides them to it. After one-third of the film, it goes terribly wrong for Aron. This is also the part where James Franco shows his amazing talents.Aron slips into a deep canyon and his arm got stuck under a builder. He stays surprisingly very calm, I would totally freak out if I got stuck like that and didn't knew what do to do! Lucky for him he got some ideas, but without water great ideas also dry up.. James Franco did an amazing job in showing different emotions towards the situation. I mentioned before in an other review that I think Franco is better in his more dramatic roles. I like him better anyway. Aron was calm but also terrified and at some points he was really losing his mind. Can you imagine, being stuck for 127 hours and without water and sunlight? Aron's little 'show' was really funny and just like the multiple flashbacks it also shows that he knows he has to change. There's one moment when his mind is so far away that you might think he made it!I thought the ending of the film was very beautiful and emotional. I also liked what the filmmakers did at the end and beginning: the contrast of big events with a lot of people versus the lonesomeness of one man near the Moab canyon. I also like the camera work! How Franco recorded himself in the canyon but also while on his back. The scenes where he made a 'selfie' really made me laugh. I mean this film was made in 2010 but the story is from 2003. I've said it before: A 'selfie' is nothing new!These kind of films always makes me wonder how I would act and if I had a change of survival? I hope I'll never have to find that out. And I think the most important lesson you can take from this film, is that you always must tell someone where you're going. But also to enjoy and never give up!!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A spiced-up version of Touching the Void,"Danny Boyle's latest exploit tells the true story of a man trapped in a crevasse with a boulder pinning down his right arm for over five days. Unable to free himself, cocky climber, Aron Rolston (James Franco), is driven to cut off the limb with a blunt blade. Had a lesser-known character been in the directing chair then this could have easily been brushed off as another monotonous, slow-moving piece of dross whereby the viewer is left waiting for the inevitable. Remember Open Water?The skeptics will be pleased to hear that the great British filmmaker hasn't lost the plot. 127 Hours is held together by the bursts of intensity that Boyle is renowned for. The camera gets right up as if to smell to Rolston; its gets inside his water bottle; and it buries under his skin. Stylistic finesse is abandoned in favour of an ugly closeness as we see one man degenerate into a urine-guzzling nutter.The most basic of narratives is infused with spouts of paranoia, nostalgia and delirium. As Rolston defiantly stares death in the face, the audience is treated to a series of anecdotes and fantasies. Through this period of self-reflection Aron admits to his own selfishness. He calls out to his mother, his father and his sister. But as his imagination takes over, a sensuous love story develops into bouts of pleasure and heartbreak.Not all of 127 Hours is played out through delusional mind-tricks. Canon must have scooped the biggest product-placement deal of 2011 as much of Aron's confessions and messages are recorded on a hand-held video-camera. His rendition of a morning talkshow is a particular highlight. Having been tortured through the cheesy 'snapshot' sound-bites, one can only feel a sense of frustration and disappointment that this real-life documentation is not revealed in the credits, at least. Instead, we are introduced to the real Aron Rolston through a pathetically banal on-sofa-with-wife-and-baby shot.The soundtrack is drawn, in part, from popular music. Though this may sometimes feel misplaced, it makes the film work in mysterious ways, juxtaposing Bill Withers' 'Lovely Day' to a scene of screaming agony. At the darkest of moments horrific shudders of a cracking bone thunder through the audience. Yet the overwhelming audio-effect is to build up the feel-good factor of what would otherwise have been rather grim film.Boyle has blasted out a spiced up version of Touching the Void Never to give a roller-coaster ride. Full of guilty cinematic pleasures, 127 Hours is worth seeing on the big screen. Never before has such a limited plot been executed with such vibrancy. If nothing else, 127 Hours will make you increasingly sentimental about your right arm.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Survival,"Aron Ralston (James Franco) is a guy living for adventures. In one of his canyon explorations, though, his hand gets trapped under a boulder. That's where an insane fight for survival begins.The plot is simple. What makes it interesting is the use of camera that offers both breathtaking landscapes and the subjective view of reality through the main character's eyes. Also, the sheer realism shows a man can go to great lengths in order to save his life and it makes sure that some scenes will stick with the viewer for quite some time, the most obvious example being the climax, one of the most difficult to watch scenes in memory.Above all, however, stands James Franco's performance, who brings an incredible intensity to his character that essentially carries the movie and keeps the audience engaged throughout its entirety, which is no small feat, considering it's a one man show in one location for more than one hour. One scene that showcases the mastery of his craft is when he imagines himself as a guest of a radio show and portrays both the presenter and himself, a combination of comedy and tragedy, an emotional tour de force.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A true story that looks fake,"From the get-go, people were skeptical about this film adaptation of Aron Ralston's autobiography Between a Rock and a Hard Place, and for good reason: it's hard to make a compelling drama about a man who spent five days of his life stuck in a canyon. Or, as Danny Boyle puts it: ""The audience has to care for the entire 127 hours, not just the last 40 minutes"" (the contents of which it's best not to disclose in case someone isn't aware of how the story ends). Now, it is remarkable, even commendable, that Boyle used his newfound respectability (read: post-Oscar rise in fame) to get this seemingly impossible project off the ground, but throughout the film there's an awkward truth that emerges: he wasn't the right director for this project.A shame, since the story could lend itself to a good movie, provided certain adjustments were made. As Ralston recounts in his book, he should have told someone where he was going on that fateful day in 2003, when his latest mountain trip turned into a nightmare: stuck between a huge boulder and the mountain wall and unable to move, he quickly ran out of supplies and optimism, giving in to hallucinations and video-messages to his loved ones. Then, on the fifth day, he came up with a brave, shocking solution.The challenge, according to Boyle, was making 127 Hours a film that worked as a full dramatic unit, not just a money shot with an irrelevant build-up. His passion for the project was so big that, for the first time in his career, he has also worked on the script (alongside Slumdog Millionaire partner Simon Beaufoy). And for the first fifteen minutes or so, it looks like he's nailed the tone, capturing Aron's euphoria and naivety as he prepares for the hike, arrives at the canyon and interacts with two attractive girls (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) before his unfortunate experience. It's an approach that has worked before - the fun before the tragedy - and it sets up the plot nicely.Unfortunately, once Ralston is stuck (and Boyle with him, so to speak), the director has to figure out how to make the film gripping without leaving the canyon. His solution? He doesn't, allowing for several hallucination and dream sequences that allow him to expand the cast (Kate Burton and Treat Williams as the parents, Lizzy Caplan as the younger sister) and, more importantly, show off his visual trademarks once again. And there lies the real problem with 127 Hours: given the harrowing and very real subject matter, a certain restraint would be expected. Instead, the film is closer in tone to Trainspotting and Slumdog Millionaire, meaning the true story displayed on screen looks too fake and movie-like to fully convince. Okay, so the scenes in question are justified in terms of narrative (Ralston himself has admitted he was hallucinating), but playing them on a loop, like Boyle does (seriously, there's a dream sequence every five minutes), makes for a very repetitive and dull viewing.This also impacts on the central performance, arguably the film's main talking point. Though his talent has never been in question, be it as James Dean, Spider-Man's best friend or a comedy drug dealer, James Franco is justly regarded as one of the finest actors of his generation. However, he's never had to carry an entire movie (well, most of it) like he does here, and it's truly sad that Boyle struggles to keep his camera still, because the pain and despair reflected on Franco's face is the kind of a stuff that, if the overall movie were stronger, would definitely be worthy of an Oscar. Even if the growth (or rather lack thereof) of his facial hair over those five days is absolutely unrealistic.On paper, the combination of material, star and filmmaker was a good match. At the end of it all, though, the result is uneven and unconvincing, and it's all due to the director. Don't get me wrong, Danny Boyle is a very talented filmmaker. It's just that until he finds a way to keep his more visionary instincts in check, he should stay away from movies like this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
between a rock and a hard place,"Watching the first 30 minutes of 127 hours is like bathing your senses with the great outdoors. Watching the last 30 minutes is like a dream where your senses are numbing slowly only to be jolted once again with a charge of redemption. Danny Boyle captures the exhilaration of an outdoor adventure in such beautiful and creative ways. Its all a fun ride until our hero Aron falls in to a crevice and gets his arm stuck between a boulder and the cavern wall. Here is where he has his big oops moment, because you see, Aron never told anyone where he was going and for how long. On top of that he forgot his one essential tool, the ''Swiss army knife"". Which later would have come in great use when he cuts his own arm off. Oh yes, he does and its gruesome. (but not to the point where anyone would faint. I've heard the stories and I don't get it, its not that bad.) It is here where his journey of survival begins. As he hallucinates and ponders on all the things that he done in his life, the girl he loved, and the family he'll miss. We the audience can't help but question ourselves, what would we do? Based on the unbelievable true story of Aron Ralston, ""127 hours"" is a rousing achievement in film making. Its a gorgeous looking film yet under the direction of Danny Boyle it definitely has an Indie touch. You know you're going to see something different. Much of the time is spent with James Franco's character and for this reason he has to be completely present and captivating. Franco's knocks it out of the park, he is fantastic in this role and does an amazing job taking us on his character's emotional roller coaster ride. A.R. Rahman joins Boyle for the second time and nails the music. It has a wonderful soundtrack.

Unforgettable,"Dazzling, immense, emotional, frightening, beautiful, dynamic, nerve-racking, inspirational and yes, very very good.127 Hours starts out as Aron the mountain climber collects his gear and heads out to an isolated canyon in Utah. There he gets into an accident that leaves his arm stuck by a rock. With little water and food Aron is trapped for five days, time while he reflects back to his life, friends, family and battles brutal inhumane will, courage and strength to free himself and be saved. As the trailer says--- ""There is no force on Earth more powerful than the will to live"".James Franco portrays Aron Ralston, and lets be honest, he does that remarkably well. It is just such a powerful performance helped by superb camera-work and visuals. I haven't been this impressed for a long long time. The cinematography is really strong and the film itself is brilliantly edited. 127 Hours has just such a fantastic style. Weather its Aron cycling in the desert, stunning long shots of the nature or simple highway lights at nights town, Boyle captures it all splendidly. I especially liked the one-on-ones Aron has with his camera. ""Good morning everyone, it is 7 o'clock here in Canyonland, U-S-A. And this morning on the boulder... We have a very special guest, Aron Ralston!"" If Franco doesn't get the Academy Award here, it must be something really wrong with the system.The experience you get absorbs you.

Does a good job with its premise,"This film is based on a real life story that can effectively be encapsulated in one sentence, so it had a challenge from the outset.

127 Hours (2010),"Boyle shows his true talent by directing a film about not much. Franco carries the film very well. It's pretty much just him. It's great to see him also adding layers of interest, by taking him from sympathetic, to just pathetic, and then back again. Boyle livens things up in such a claustrophobic environment, with some truly imaginative and often scary dream sequences. I'll never look at Scooby-Doo the same again. It started off on the wrong foot, with painful editing, jazzing it into some lifeless unfocused trash. I really had trouble liking this at first. It seemed like a first time director, and not someone like Boyle, whom should be confident by now. Things did turn around, even if the music was too intrusive at times. When you get to the climatic scene, it was one where I was grimacing, gritting my teeth, but also hoping for the best.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
127 Hours,"127 HOURS – 9.3/10Director: Danny BoyleWriter: Danny Boyle, Simon BeaufoyThe first film I saw of Danny Boyle's was Slumdog Millionaire and his third was 127 hours. From an ordinary, mainstream and clichéd director, he rose to the status of an extraordinary genius, ring master and a leader in his style of work. It was the brilliance of 127 hours and Trainspotting that led me to understand the master at work in Slumdog. It's a film worthy of discussion, and probably can teach you as much about direction as you would learn from a month long workshop.The story deals with the real life incident of trekker Aron Ralston , played exceptionally well by James Franco, who fell into a crevice in a remote canyon in Utah as a lose boulder came off and trapped his hand in the process. In my opinion, the subject the film deals with is the hardest to recreate as you are dealing with almost one subject for the entire length of the film, and here is the hardest part – your subject is stuck in one place. Boyle manages to do what no other director has dared or achieved to do thus far. Many survival stories have been made, but I remember none being so enigmatic and captivating for the entire duration of the film.Boyle uses several techniques from triptychs, zooming and split-screens to mash-ups and other beautiful original and inventive techniques. The challenge was to ensure that at no point, the film becomes static as the story had forced the subject to be. Audience attention span is limited and you can often lose them very quickly if nothing much transpires on screen for more than a few minutes. In this case, Boyle absolutely conscious of this fact, at all times, keeps the camera alive. There is almost a sense of desperation in the camera work, which in reality is actually conveying the trapped trekker's desperation.The film reflects what one could call Boyle's vivid and childlike imagination. In the hands of a serious story teller, this film could become another survival tale meant to pluck at those emotional strings, more suited for a Discovery Channel documentary than an hour and a half commercial relay. Boyle paints the film colorful, capturing every little detail one could possibly capture in a cramped crevice. James Franco, who has managed to raise standards for acting in survival films to a new high, is as much part of the charisma that Boyle creates with his breath-taking camera work. It is to be observed how Franco switches from a tormented trapped trekker unsure of what will happen in the next few hours to a mature, controlled and calm individual in control of the situation. Franco jokes around as though he was on television, and you can see the pain and realization, and the hopefulness lingering on his face and in his voice. Boyle does an excellent job of using, memories, flash-backs and hallucinations to build character and move the film forward.127 Hours is an achievement, a feat in itself. The very fact that such a difficult story was chosen shows extreme boldness and appetite for new challenges on part of the director. The film is arguably the best survival film I have seen. This proves so much that we don't need a lot of special effects and large budgets or exotic locations to make something worth your money. Three cheers for Danny Boyle!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unimaginable,"Being stranded or trapped in a remote location is the stuff of nightmares. I can't even begin to imagine what Aron Ralston was going through mentally, psychologically, emotionally, and physically while stuck in Blue John Canyon. I don't know if I could've survived. Eventually, **SPOILER** Aron (played by James Franco) cut his arm off.I was talking to a friend of mine and I asked at what point would you have been willing to cut your arm off? I personally don't know, but I would imagine 127 hours might be the point because I'd have to be in such a dire situation to even work up the stomach to do such a thing. Nevermind that I love having an arm to do all sorts of things, but the very thought of severing any appendage of mine gives me chills. ""127 Hours"" also gave me chills. It is slow at some points because we're talking about a movie with a man in one singular location. They did well with the source material and the ending was moving.

A terrible accident that causes an adrenaline junkie to stop and appreciate life,"Since this had been nominated for several Oscars, this was on my must-see list since this year began and I didn't regret finally seeing it.Acting: We spend most the duration with James Franco and it's a very convincing performance. He really gives the impression that Aron grows from his initial(perhaps incorrect factually to the real Aron?) cocky, careless, hedonistic-type. When he's in pain(enhanced by the 'interference' type sounds towards the end), it all looks realistic. The other actors who could be called pretty much cameos all seem natural on screen.Pacing and Plot: It was really well paced as I was glued to the screen all the way through and one man's triumph against adversity in a painful accident is always interesting subject matter.Cinematography: The use of fast pace editing initially to depict his lifestyle, split-screen and hand-held is effective. Later on, his hallucinations don't feel too fantastical so it's incongruous yet odd enough to let the audience know what he's seeing isn't real. For a film set in mainly one place, the Canyon is shot in an way that it seems like a intriguing but an arid and hazardous place.Score: Pulsating and fitting.Overall, it's uplifting yet sad(as he had to amputate his own limb) to watch a young man have a renewed respect for life, through this terrible, costly accident. In such as quick moving world, through this very unfortunate situation, he's forced to slow down, with only his thoughts and video camera for company. A brutal wake up call that being reckless for thrills can lead to severe consequences, so it pays to be safe, rather than sorry (the epilogue also alludes to this, in as many words).",,Anonymous,Biography
Franco is the reason this is worth watching,"127 Hours follows the true story of arrogant adventurist Aron Ralston on the biggest misadventure he could come across. He takes a lonely exploring, mountain climbing hike in Blue John Canyon but when he falls on a rock, dislodging it in the process, he finds himself trapped in a narrow crevice with his hand wedged firmly behind this rock.The story follows Aron as he goes through pain, emotional stress, dehydration and hallucinations whilst trapped for five days in this narrow, lonely crack. His only utensils are a bottle of water, which he must ration in order to survive, a cheap utility tool which is nothing short of useless, some rope which isn't much use to a guy who can only use one hand, and a camcorder, which ends up being his prized tool as it is his way of documenting his situation and keeping himself in check with reality whilst he waits for his demise or his emotional blow out. The film manages to ask the question, what would you do? If you know the film, or the story you will know the outcome but again, would you do it?The film is basically served around James Franco, bar a scene at the beginning where he meets two lost girls and shows them the time of their lives (swimming in the depths of a canyon, what else could that mean?) and the people he holds places for in his heart which we see in flashbacks. These are the people and the situations that he believes led him to this crisis, losing the love of his life, ignoring his Mother's phone calls, his constant neglect for telling people where he is going, a lone wolf as he seems to be. It's not until a premonition shows him all that he could achieve in life, the fathering of his son, where he finally makes the sacrifice that others would chose not to. The film is not so much a story as it is an emotional journey with a man whose self belief is so strong that he will do whatever it takes to pursue future moments in his life.The film is generally good due to Franco's fantastic portrayal of Aran, he has you believing all of his pain, all of his anger and remorse. A particular scene is when he interviews himself on a make believe talk show called 'On the Boulder'. The way he delivers his split personality situation is just brilliant and also the final scene where the inevitable happens, where Franco really allows you to feel like you're in his shoes and has you squirming away until he finishes his make or break choice. Franco's performance is top notch but so is most of Danny Boyle's direction. The sound used for pivotal moments, the split screen movements and some of the music are great. It's just a pity that some of the score seems out of place and a few editorial decisions, such as the photograph snapping sequences, seem like they just don't need to be there. It is an area which lets down Boyle initial direction.Although a lot of praise goes into the acting and directing, it is the only thing that makes this film tick. The story seems better suited for a half hour news reel or hour long documentary and it only stretches to the ninety minute mark because of a pointless opening scene with the two girls and an overuse of flashbacks. There was a point in the middle where I was drifting out of the movie as it was becoming a bit repetitive. Of course the movie is moving as it is true but there are not a lot of things you can do with one man in a canyon.The acting is superb, definitely Oscar Winning worthy, the direction was good, the score was up and down and sadly these are the things that really drive this movie. If it wasn't for them then I think this film would dive and it only has seen great reviews because of these aspects. All in all just a good movie and nothing more, unfortunately.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Between Life and Death!,"'127 HOURS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Yet another remarkably bold achievement in seemingly impossible cinematic storytelling this year! Like 'BURIED' from earlier this year this film tells the story of one man trapped in a single confined location for the duration of almost the entire film. Unlike 'BURIED' this film sets up the scenario and also leaves the primary location in flashbacks and day dreams. It also utilizes a lot of flashy special effects and stylized visuals to drive it's message home. It's still an astonishingly creative and one of a kind film going experience. It's impressively directed by Danny Boyle (in his long awaited follow-up to the Academy Award winning 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE') and features one of the best performances of the year (right alongside Ryan Reynolds in 'BURIED' in my opinion) from early Oscar front-runner James Franco.The film is written by Boyle and his 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE' scriptwriter Simon Beaufoy. It's based on an autobiographical book by Aron Ralston (entitled ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place""). The book tells of Ralston's world famous mountain climbing adventure where he became trapped by a collapsed boulder, which pinned his arm, while climbing alone in an isolated canyon in Utah in 2003. Ralston was trapped for over 5 days and finally grew up enough courage to resort to desperate measures in order to free himself and survive. Franco gives probably his finest performance to date playing the man as he struggles with survival, losing his sanity and facing his biggest regrets in life. The real Aron Ralston kept a video diary while he was stuck, as depicted in the film (using the same exact camera). He had only allowed his family and friends to view the video until he let Boyle and Franco see the footage in order to more accurately depict true events. It's been quoted that Ralston is quite happy with and moved by the film.The film is of course very moving and inspirational (at times even tear jerking) but this is something that any competent filmmaker should have been able to deliver given the material and resources. How Boyle tells the story is what's truly remarkable and memorable about the film as well as his ability to stretch the material into a highly involving and entertaining adventure for a full 93 minutes (credit also has to be given to his co-scriptwriter for that though). The movie is very claustrophobic, surreal and horrifying. The climax is excruciatingly hard to watch and more grotesque than almost any horror film (there have been reports of viewers suffering from shock and needing medical assistance at multiple screenings). James Franco is one of those actors that I never thought had much talent early on given a lot of the choices in film roles he'd take but it appears as though he just made a lot of unwise career decisions (I always thought he was the weakest link in the 'SPIDER-MAN' films). In recent years he's proved himself to be one of the most talented and diverse young actors working today. 'PINEAPPLE EXPRESS' was his initial role that really caught my attention (but I also hadn't seen his earlier memorable work on 'FREAKS AND GEEKS' until after that). This is his finest performance to date and one of the best single performances of the year and the movie is one of the most impressive creative achievements of the year as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JQ4A-I9-JM",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

127 Hours,"From the first frame, the breathtaking beauty of the cinematography subjugated me since Danny Boyle's consistent visual concussion maintained at a high standard. I am not a rhapsodic traveler at all, still I was moved by the film and by the protagonist Aron Ralston.The film deals with a quite essential proposition that when we encounter our incubus expectedly (for Aron, it was the stone, and for numerous others, it could be anything which may serve us as a hindrance), how to gather the courage, then exert reduction to practice to vanquish it eventually; the whole process is a personal sublimation for each individual as well.The one-actor setting offers James Franco a chance once in a blue moon that he could take it as his career's magnum opus. Thankfully he lives up to our expectation and delivers a energetic and vivid performance which should be concluded as powerful and splendid! I put him as my No.2 BEST ACTOR 2010 (after Jesse Eisenberg) by far. Now 2011 Oscar has just finished, Franco's sluggish state does suggest that it is a wise decision that he should never meddle with emcee anymore.I think the bloody nerve-cutting scene does persuade some potential audience from watching it, which I consider is a big loss, if one could endure the raw physiological torture (literally it only lasts several seconds at most), you will find it is worthwhile.The flashbacks & illusions after the accident happened were well-crafted, diluted the humdrum of the crack setting and enriched the character too. It is an amazing payoff as the storyline is way too thin (compared with SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE) to be scripted into a feature length film.After the overwhelming success of SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE (2008), Boyle's follow-up inherits his skillful interpretation and devotes an encouraging film which once again shows his surefooted talent to make wonders.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Could have been worse as Arron - now married - will find out if that goes wrong; he'll lose a leg as well (sage nod from many out there...).However one-dimensional the premise sounds, what transpires for an hour and a half is as gripping as you could possibly imagine wringing out of it.Tense and unnerving, gruesome, and heartwarming. And that was just my reaction to the reappearance of the Trainspotting couch (looking fitter and stronger; undoubtedly a method-couch).Stunningly shot, a treat for the eye.

Another film with a lot of potential marred by Danny Boyle,"127 Hours is the new film by Danny Boyle, made of the back of the success of Slumdog Millionaire, starring James Franco as Aron Ralston, an extreme sports obsessive, who gets his arm trapped under a boulder for 127 hours. Having gone alone and without having told anyone where he was going, he is stranded. Facing a lack of rations and severe weather conditions, Ralston muses on his relationships with his family and friends, realising that he has foolishly kept everyone at a distance. In the end, he resorts to desperate measures in order to survive.Nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, as well as numerous other accolades, 127 Hours has become something of a surprise hit. However, it has a good many flaws, particularly from a directorial standpoint. Danny Boyle looks and sounds like an absolute chancer. His previous work has been varied at best, with Shallow Grave and Trainspotting being very uneven films that don't work the way they should and Sunshine degenerating from a film with a lot of potential into a stupid and crass slasher film. To put it simply, Danny Boyle's films would be good if someone else made them.127 Hours sees Boyle back to his old tricks. The opening ten minutes employ all sorts of flashy editing tricks, from split-screens to jump cuts. This is done presumably to show how vacuous Ralston's adrenaline fuelled lifestyle is, a form of extroverted misanthropic loneliness. But Boyle doesn't quit. Even when Ralston is trapped to the canyon and largely immobile, the camera jumps all over the place, shooting in and out of the canyon and filming him from inside a water bottle (more of which later). An attempt at creating a mood of isolation and helplessness is constantly undercut by Boyle's prancing and dancing camera. For a proper film about a character stuck alone in a small space see Buried.What's worse is that Boyle's apparent showboating tarnishes everything else in the film. James Franco is very impressive, delivering a performance that is entirely convincing and a genuine step up for the actor. However, Boyle's impatient and jittery film cannot hold a shot long enough for us to feel properly introduced to Franco's character. We rarely even get to have a good view of him, as the shots used prioritise extreme close-ups and shots from behind Franco. We are never given the chance to watch a performance and by the end it doesn't even seem like he has changed all that much. A case in point, the previously mentioned shot from inside Ralston's water bottle. At this point in the film, Ralston decides to just finish his water and be done with it. Here, what is of interest is Franco's performance, playing a man completely at the end of his tether. Instead, Boyle shows us what a water bottle would see when someone is drinking out of it. The shot does not look good and it does not further the drama, it is just ridiculous. And, as such, it is incredibly annoying.Because the final sequence fails to be life affirming and joyous, largely due to the fact that Boyle shoots it like a typically terrible ""X Factor"" human-interest montage (as well as this, the apparently vacuous split-screen sequence returns, destroying any sense that Ralston has been changed for the better by his experience), the end result is a film that feels like it has been sabotaged by a director desperate to be noticed. Every good thing about the film, from its performances to its cinematography to its general theme, is undermined by a camera in constant search of a cool, new angle to shoot from and frenetic editing that won't let you get a good look at anything.

I don't care how bad I play, I have never once been in the position to even consider cutting my own arm off to get back to the clubhouse.That being said This is an incredibly intense, rough, and powerful film that is by no means easy to watch, but it is quite good.If you don't knew the story, Aron Ralston, an avid outdoors-man, mountaineer, hiker, biker, all of that, goes off for a weekend ride and exploration without telling anyone where he's going and had the worst possible thing happen to him. No, he wasn't killed or sodomized by hill folk, a rock in a cave he was climbing gave way, pinning his arm to the wall of the cave. In the middle of nowhere, out of view, and running low on supplies his case seemed hopeless until he made the realization that ""I have a great tourniquet."" Oh, and it's a true story.This film focuses on the 127 hours from when he falls to the moment he makes a decision that most people couldn't even consider making. What you have here is a person, faced with a dire situation, no food, little water, unable to even turn around, having to jerry rig a climbing harness just to sleep, seeing his life for what it is, the good and the bad. This film presents a man laid bare and shows what you learn about yourself and life when it appears you will lose it.The film itself is extremely well made. Danny Boyle pulls out as many stops as one can when dealing with a scenario that renders the camera immobile for a majority of the proceedings. Visually, he seems to be locked into his ""Slumdog Millionaire"" film grammar. It has that look and feel, the rich colors, the slightly slowed action, rewound scenes, flashbacks to small details we missed the first time, but the thematic elements keep it from feeling like a retread. He mixes a very stylized editing and grandiose establishing shots that show the vastness of the landscape with shaky hand held tracking shots that make you feel personally involved.What I found most impressive was his use of sound. Not only to convey the isolation, but, more impressively, to communicate the intense pain of a self preformed amputation. The use of the camcorder, not only as source for on screen footage but as a second character, is incredibly affecting, and allows James Franco (in the performance of his career) to show the emotional swings from a forced joy to borderline insanity, and finally into the determination to live that would drive a man to such action.This is not an easy film to watch, but it is not the people fainting at screenings histrionic affair that some are making it out to be. What it is is a very honest and real portrayal of what happens when you are confronted with losing everything.Read more from me at www.thefilmthugs.com",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It's not just watching him cutting of his own arm, it's understanding why.","I have always given high praise to director Danny Boyle. I loved ""28 Days Later"" and ""Sunshine"". But the film he is most famous for, is probably my least favorite. Sorry if i go against the grain here, but i thought ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was just plain okay. It wasn't anything i would go around hootin' and hollarin' about, and it certainly wasn't something i would consider worthy of winning best picture of 2008. Never the less, he is a great filmmaker, and none of his films are ever alike. So i am glad to see that a director like him is tackling something as extraordinary as this story.I'm sure we all remember hearing this story way back when. The man who cut off his own arm to save his life. A human coyote. Asside from the story being very prolific, the question is, can you make a man trapped in a canyon by himself an entertaining picture? The answer here is both yes, and no. While the movie does a great job of explaining and making you understand his ultimate want and desire to cut off his own arm in order to survive, it didn't really create this overwhelming feeling of life. By that i mean, i didn't feeling this desirable urge for him to escape. I wasn't hoping and praying that he would be rescued like i wanted to be. Yes, the movie does create these scenarios, and they are very very good. But let's face it, with a movie like this, you want to be standing on your feet cheering your heart out from the inside.And that really is my only problem with the movie. It really isn't a big one, and it doesn't effect the movie by any means. It's just one of those things that could have been a little better.Other than that, everything else was top notch. Danny Boyle combined with his directing and incredible editing team make this journey both fast paced and emotional at the same time......something very hard to accomplish. But the thing everyone will be talking about is James Franco, who in my opinion, just gave the best performance of his life. I have always praised actors who have nothing around them to work with, and create scenes with their body movements. And James Franco is one of the reasons why i support this belief. Don't be surprised to be hearing his name around Oscar season.Now onto the event that i'm sure everyone wants to hear about, and that is the final arm cutting climax. Now, i have seen some pretty down right and dirty things on film before.......and this is pretty bad. I hardly ever squirm, and i was squirming really hard. I mean, the guy cuts off his arm with a pocket knife, how do you not make it gory? Bottom Line, the movie is easily one of the best i have seen so far this year. No, i don't think this is THE best of the year, but it certainly deserves to be in the ranks of this years top 10. But this movie easily deserves numerous Oscar noms.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
If only the goofs weren't too much,"I think the strength of this movie is the details and when you watch it and find a goof it destroys the whole thing. He was never in pain, nor did he show it was just not realistic (at least to me). From the moment he fell until he was rescued, there was no sign of pain, vomiting, or tears, only self-loathing. More disappointing after reading the goofs section of this site. And unfortunately, his personal backstory is also not very entertaining way of telling either.",,Anonymous,Biography
Giving up,"I try to have as little knowledge about movies I am about to watch as possible. It was impossible though, to not get the one big incident in the movie. Everyone was talking about it and he even made a skit for comedy show (I think it was for Jon Stewarts Show), where it was obvious what he was going to make.But if you watch the movie, you will understand that it's not a big secret anyway. It's almost the first thing he does anyway. Though it doesn't happen. Apart from this really big incident, you might wonder what the movie will be about. And how trapped it will feel (remember Buried?). And you will be surprised that while you might feel closed in, there is also quite a few sequences where the mind wanders ... and I have to admit, I never thought he (Danny Boyle, director) would make those bold choices (visually speaking). I'm even more surprised that the Academy would give this more than one nod (though ultimately it didn't win).Very intense drama, about being trapped and not having a way out. But still having the will to live through it ... But is it enough? Watch and see for yourself",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A visceral experience like no other,"You might remember from 2003 the story of a hiker named Aron Ralston. He made the mainstream media cycle telling about his triumphant story of being trapped under a boulder for 5 days (127 hours) and escaping by amputating his own arm. 127 Hours is the telling of this story, and I feel like the only more intense way to experience the events of this film would be by being Aron Ralston himself. It is one of the most visceral and intense experiences I've ever witnessed to this kind of prolonged extent on screen. Before going on this hike, Ralston told nobody where he was going, and so when he got his arm trapped under that boulder, he knew there was hardly any way out. He suffered through increasingly gruesome things to keep himself alive, all leading up to the grisly amputation of his own arm, which is shown in its horrendous entirety in the movie, not holding back at all. However, it is a fair trade since he escaped the inescapable with his life, and continues to hike and mountain climb today. The story of Aron Ralston is miraculous and inspiring, and 127 Hours does it justice ten times over.Only the first ten to fifteen minutes of the film have Aron safe and untrapped, and the movies title doesn't even appear until after being trapped by the boulder. Needless to say, the majority of the film is just Aron Ralston, and thank God he is played by the incredibly talented James Franco. Franco's performance is one of the best I've seen in a long time because of just how demanding it is. Few actors can carry a film by themselves, but Franco does an amazing job all alone at the bottom of a crevice. The dialouge is limited save for a couple of scenes, but Franco never lets up in his performance and does so much with so little, which is really the biggest triumph of the film in its entirety. That being its ability to do so much with such limited resources. And so much of that credit goes to a brilliant lead actor whose ability soars above and beyond any solo role of this sort in a long time.James Franco can't get all the credit though. A film that takes place with one man at the bottom of a two foot wide crevice has to retain life, energy, and variety, and with a director like Danny Boyle, it does just that. Boyle is a master of the sharp edits and quick cuts, and he puts this talent to full use for 127 Hours. He has to, or else this film would have deteriorated quickly into something very tiring and boring. But Boyle's fresh visual flair keeps the film extremely lively the whole way through, and one scene after another drew me in closer and closer. I was never bored by this film, and I never felt like I wanted it to hurry up and get to the point. Every scene has a point. It's an engaging character study of Aron Ralston, while also being a piece of art. Boyle employs such unique artistic technique into this film, making it a mixture of beautiful, gruesome, disturbing, and visceral. Boyle is a master at editing. Every shot and every cut of this movie is so well timed and so perfectly illustrated to make a never ending work of art that sends you through a frenzy of heightened emotion.Boyle also perfects his visual experience with excellent music selection. A. R. Rahman, the composer of Boyle's last film Slumdog Millionaire, returned to compose this film as well. Obviously the music is completely different from Slumdog but it is very fitting and makes the experience that much more intense. What we hear is aligned so perfectly with what we see on screen, giving the film an air of expert craftsmanship, as well as an innovative and original piece of art.There is so much more to this film beyond the incredible survival story we are treated to, and thats what makes it a visceral experience like no other. Everything is put together so well and not a single shred of artistic excellence is missing. I could not ask for more from a film like this that is something just so emotionally enveloping that I know I won't be able to get my mind off of it for days. It is definitely one of the best of the year so far. The only things that I think could top it that haven't come out yet are Darren Aronofsky's Black Swan, set to release December 3rd, or the Coen brothers remake of True Grit, coming December 25th. But until then, and even long afterwords, see 127 Hours, just be prepared.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"More bold adventure film, less soulful drama","Based on the true, survival-against-all-odds story ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"", James Franco is Aron Ralston, and he is literally stuck between a rock and a hard place—a canyon wall in the Utah desert to be more exact. ""127 Hours"" records the time from when Aron finds himself stranded and trapped alone in a canyon, and has to use everything that he is mentally and physically capable of to try and get himself free.I found it very similar to ""Touching the Void"" (2003) and ""Into the Wild"" (2007). Here, Danny Boyle captures the Utah desert in all its glory (and its few fauna and flora), James Franco in his many stages of anguish and loneliness, and his extreme adventurous nature, complete with lots of loud techno music.Franco is expected to be in the running for the Best Actor Oscar, but I'm still trying to figure out how Emile Hirsch didn't receive the nomination for the aforementioned ""Into the Wild"". I think Boyle wanted to make this more of a bold adventure film rather than a soulful drama, so there were moments with quick, flashy editing and pumping music, and occasions for drug-like hallucinations. That's what depreciated the value of ""127 Hours"" for me, but it is still a spectacular story of the human will.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It's not bad, but it's not one of those movies I would like to watch again","This is just a basic movie with a basic plot which I was expecting. The plot was interesting from the beginning, but as the movie went on it started to get a little bit uninteresting as there wasn't anything exciting happening. I would've like to have seen more of his family or friends and see their reaction of Aron being missing and finding out what happened to him, but I guess I am asking for too much. Overall this is a decent movie, but not an entertaining movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not going to be a rocky road for James Franco from now on! Franco reaches new heights!,"Director Danny Boyle probably had some type of massive rock fall on his head as a kid and is probably the main reason why he is such a maniacal auteur who does not play within the conventional rules of orchestrating a film; as depicted in his directorial work in such movies as ""Trainspotting"", ""28 Days Later"", and the Oscar-winning ""Slumdog Millionaire"". Danny Boy has done it again in the gripping ""127 Hours"", the movie based on the true story of mountain climber Aaron Ralston. While canyoneering in Utah 2003, Ralston had a boulder crash on his arm; trapping him in an isolated canyon for (yea, you guessed it) 127 hours! Ralston's remarkable survival story is what entraps viewers in ""127 Hours"". Boyle is definitely not a lazy director, and his energy and workmanship is shown around the clock in ""127 Hours""; from Aaron's survival skills, to the expeditious visuals of Aaron's adventuristic persona, to Aaron's desperate motives of detachment; I hope I did not have to arm wrestle with your brain in figuring that last one out. Speaking of detachment, the ""arm self-amputation"" scene of the movie is the one that is stirring a buzz in movie world. It's the authenticity of the scene and not so much its graphic nature that makes it work. And of course, the bold Boyle is responsible for its excellence. ""127 Hours"" screenplay was mediocre at best; probably due to the nature of the movie, so I am not trying to take anything away from the film's screenwriters Simon Beaufoy and Boyle himself. Nature and its catastrophic capabilities play an integral role in the film highlighted by the superb technical work of: Cinematographers Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle, Art Director Christopher DeMuri, and Production Designer Suttirat Anne Larlarb. They all deserve Oscar nominations! Jon Harris' master cutting in editing the movie, and A.R. Rahman's master tuning in scoring the movie are also climbing the Oscar mountain of nominations for those applicable categories. But to be ""Franco"" with you, the peak of ""127 Hours"" has to be James Franco's mesmerizing performance as Aaron Ralston. I will give my right arm (I know, wrong choice of words; Sorry Aaron!) to have James Franco be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar nomination. Wait a minute! I don't think I would have to give my right arm since he is already a favorite for a Best Actor Oscar nomination! Sorry, I guess I was arm & hammered when I wrote that last statement. Anyways, Franco's emotional, rawpower thespian work will definitely make the cut as one of the most talked about acting performance of the year. There is not much of a supporting acting ensemble to ""127 Hours"" since it was Franco's showcase. But we did get a treat in seeing veteran actor Treat Williams appear as Aaron's dad; and there were a couple of sharp performances from Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn as mountain climbers that Aaron meets before his downfall. I will not proclaim ""127 Hours"" as the best movie of the year; it still has a few mountains to climb before it reaches that apex. But nevertheless, Franco and Boyle definitely make it worth your while to spend 93 minutes with ""127 Hours"". It rocks! **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Danny Boyle's best film,"There are two main elements that make this story seem like it would never work as a narrative film. Firstly, everyone knows the ending. The film is based on a very widely reported true story that almost everyone seems to know about or at least heard about in passing. And so, must people go into the film knowing how it is going to end. Boyle and company faced a very major obstacle they needed to get over: how will they keep their audience interested in a story they already know the outcome of? In addition, there is the entire notion of dramatic structure. And when you have a story that takes place almost entirely with one character who has his hand stuck under a rock, your dramatic options seem relatively limited. Aside from the one major conflict that is set up very early on, there doesn't seem to be any room for development, further conflict, complications, additional obstacles, or any kind of change whatsoever. The character is quite literally and physically stuck. How do you make this compelling?Firstly, Boyle's visual style does a pretty good job at keeping us interested. Continuing his streak with Slumdog Millionaire, Boyle, along with cinematographers Anthony Dodd Mantle and Enrique Chediak create an absolutely beautiful and rich visual palette, with dynamic camera movements and angles, beautiful framing and use of color, use of different kinds of cameras for different visual styles – consumer-grade digital cameras to get that extreme depth of field and to have objects literally pressed right up against the lens in crisp focus; wide-angle lenses, fascinating point-of-view shots and other elements that all serve to create this incredibly intense and visceral cinematic experience. The vibrant editing also does its job, with very quick, rapid-fire cuts and some of the best and most unique use of split-screen imagery I've ever seen further adding to the film's unique visual style.So how does Boyle create dramatic tension in a movie about a man who spends the entire time with his hand stuck under a rock in an isolated canyon? Easy – he takes us out of the canyon. After the accident, which occurs fairly early on in the story, the film's linear reality begins to fragment, and we begin to see what Aron begins to see. Fascinatingly enough, the film never quite makes it clear what we are seeing are flashbacks, visions and premonitions hallucinated by Aron in his desperate situation, or a combination of the two. The fact that the film blurs these lines makes the experience all the more visceral and puts us even further and deeper into Aron's head. The dynamic style of the film as well as the extremely subjective point of view it puts us in helps to create this inescapable feeling of intensity and dread as the film progresses – it is quite simple one of the most intense and nerve-racking films I have ever experienced. Our connection with the character is so strong and the style so inescapable that even events that we know will happen make us feel nervous and uncomfortable. You really start thinking: there is just absolutely no other way out of this situation, and as this truth becomes more and more obvious to Aron, the feeling of dread only intensifies and intensifies leading up to the horrifically graphic climax.When I first heard about this project, I didn't know if there was anything that could be done. And yet, Boyle and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy found an absolutely brilliant way to get around these problems, and ended up creating one of the most compelling films I have had the pleasure to see this year. By removing us from the canyon, the film ceases to be about a character with his hand stuck under a rock, and becomes a film about the character himself. What makes Aron tick? What happened to him to get him in this situation to begin with, and what does he have inside him that drives him to commit this insanely desperate and courageous act he commits at the end, one which my friends and I deliberated for hours whether or not we would be capable of doing, only to reach the conclusion that there is no way in the world we would be able to do what Aron did if we found ourselves in a similar situation. We see Aron interacting with other people, and pushing them away. We see him leisurely ignoring his friendly boss as he leaves the store he works at before he leaves for his hiking trip. We see him ignoring his mother's phone calls. We see him encounter and have fun with the two hiking girls, only to leave them as abruptly and as nonchalantly as he encountered them. In flashbacks, we see a past relationship Aron shared with a beautiful blonde girl when he was younger, a relationship that ended sourly after Aron wouldn't let her in. Even when we flash back to Aron's youth, we see that his relationship with his family was one of silence. Aron lives in his own world and doesn't let anyone in, and it is this rejection of other people that got him in this situation in the first place. However, it is the change he undergoes in the canyon under the rock as he begins to realize the mistakes he has made and yearn again for the human connection he has lacked all these years that gives him the strength to do what he did. And the shots of large crowds of people that bookend the film lend further poignancy to this notion of human connection that is so beautifully depicted in this amazing and inspirational true story of perseverance and survival.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A rocking good movie,"In cinematic terms, this story - the true-life account of how in 2003 lone climber Aron Ralston found himself stuck in Utah's Blue John Canyon - is locked between a rock and a hard place. On the one hand, it is a cracking tale that would not be credible if it had not in fact happened. On the other hand, a narrative focused on only one person in one precise place, when every viewer will know the ending, is very limiting.That it works so magnificently is down to British director Danny Boyle, whose fine work has ranged ""Trainspotting"" to ""Slumdog Millionaire"" and actor James Franco, star of three ""Spider-Man"" movies which could hardly be further removed from this fable. The story is 'opened up' by the incorporation of an invented encounter with two young women and access to flashbacks and hallucinations in Ralston's mind. Use of split screen, an atmospheric soundtrack, and superb cinematographer all enhance the experience.When Ralston decides what needs to be done to live, it is tough on the viewer but ultimately this is a project that celebrates the triumph of the human spirit. In terms of sheer courage from a man alone, the only film with which I can compare ""127 Hours"" is ""Touching The Void"" (another true story) and, in terms of the static location of most of the narrative, I recall the movie ""Phone Booth"". But ""127 Hours"" - which actually runs for only 94 minutes - is a unique production.",,Anonymous,Biography
Should rely less on flashbacks and focus more on the present survival skills,"I do not know how accurate this film is to the actual case, but it has done a good job to cover as much as possible portraying a realistic simulation of such incident. However the film could have done more to reveal certain things -- like how does he poop, how does he stay clean and, how does he not grow his facial hair etc... I am pretty sure the director or screenwriter should know the answers to these issues when they have done enough research and interview on the actual victim himself. It is not an excuse to avoid displaying these survival skills which could have been far more interesting than the too many flashbacks that were being usedCinematography is unique and Franco did well to carry out probably one of his first main roles in a film.People will certainly remember this film for a long time for its particularly outstanding climax scene.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Don't go hiking alone!,"I had first learned of Aron Ralston when he appeared on a talk show and told of his harrowing experience. Now that I've seen ""127 Hours"", I can tell you that it's also a harrowing experience. Not just an excuse for shock value, the movie is basically about the will to survive in the most dire situations. The movie is also about how Ralston changes. Starting out as a footloose, extreme mountain climber, his humanity becomes apparent as he realizes that there's only one way out of his predicament.James Franco plays Ralston to a tee, showing the man start to go delirious as he eventually decides on drastic measures. Much of the credit also goes to cinematographers Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak, who create just about every angle in the confined space where Ralston finds himself trapped by the boulder, emphasizing his feeling of desperation.All in all, if ever there was a movie about the triumph of the human spirit, this has to be it. Those five days in that slot canyon in the middle nowhere truly put the carefree Ralston's fragility to the test. I wholly recommend the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The whole, don't know what you got till it's (almost) gone, and the, I'm gonna start living my life for the one's I love, etc. To be honest, came across as super cheese, preachy.

The particularly graphic scene is disturbing and unsettling, and yet it makes viewers' spirits high in the hope of the better evil winning against the clock.The accompanying soundtrack is very good, particularly the appropriately triumphant music that plays at the end.

Outstanding Experience with an Ace Performance and Inspirational Score,"The movie is Comprehensive, Excellently made. I can assure you will not be disappointed although having high expectations. The movie has an ace performer and newly discovered of incredible amount talent is none but James Franco. He has given his heart to this film. It's a challenging role with minimum dialogs and pretty much expressions only. The movie literally turns you into Ralston's character and makes you feel the helplessness of that deadly circumstance. The movie is well written and well built character of Ralston with it's heart-felting performance by Franco keeps your mouth open.Coming to the score of the movie I can say truly that I came into tears especially in that last scene when Franko drinks water from the muddy pond,gets up holding the water bottle,runs and calls for help. And finally those guys looks back and runs to him. Its is a moment that captures your heart and eyes get wet every time you see it. Apart from Franco and Boyle, a huge accomplishment by A R Rahman who has given a truly Emotional and Inspirational score which gives a feeling that you have achieved your life back over your death just now.This is a kind of movie rather experience which stays in your heart for long time even if you want you to wipe it out. I can tell u one thing for sure, this is kind of Inspirational and Important movie (like Shawshank Redemption) which u definitely wouldn't have watched in recent past years.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stylish,"Once again, Danny Boyle shows that he has quite a lot of style. His talent for creating memorable images, powerful compositions and suspenseful, energetic shots is stronger on 127 Hours than it was on any of his films since Trainspotting. Cinematically, 127 Hours is a very solid piece, beautifully shot and edited, and complimented by a marvelous performance from Franco.And yet, at the same time, Boyle also shows just how incompetent he is at constructing a coherent and well-paced film. The chaos that worked for Trainspotting did not work well on any of his other works, and it fails here too. The biggest problem 127 has is that it begins and ends at the middle. We get no character development, no structure, no build-up, no satisfying ending - we're expected to get into the action right away, and just as quickly the film ends seconds after the climax. For that reason 127 feels more like a music video than a film. It has no real characters; the few flashbacks the protagonist has seem like a pretty lame cover-up for that fact, giving him a background and a family as generic as possible.It's pretty shocking, in fact, that a story this dark and shocking can eventually feel so light on film. Despite the grimness of the whole situation, it feels like a lighter version of Into the Wild. Which is why, as powerful as the film is while you're watching it, it leaves absolutely no lasting impression - which is criminal for a story like this. It's probably a good thing that it's short then, because it's just long enough to enjoy the visuals and Franco's acting, to be mildly shocked the way you would be at a news broadcast, and then to move on with your life.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
impressive work from Boyle and Franco,"It's 2003. Aron Ralston (James Franco) goes out into the desert to do some bike riding and rock climbing. He encounters hikers Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn). The girls invite him to a party the next day but as he continues his hike alone, he falls down a crevice and gets his hand stuck under a boulder. It's 127 hours of struggle as he tries in vain and finally decides to cut off his arm.On the surface, this is not a very cinematic story. The guy is stuck in a crevice. It doesn't allow for much movement. The three people falling through the rocks is a fun opening. Then Danny Boyle does everything to garner interesting visuals. Franco is very effective in what is essentially an one-man play in much of the movie. It's an impressive piece of work from both Franco and Boyle.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Going it alone,"Claustrophobic film is on the rise. Rodrigo Cortes's Iraq film Buried (2010) was released to surprising acclaim last year. A trailer for Sanctum (2010), the forthcoming James Cameron-produced underwater cave-exploration adventure, precedes 127 Hours: Danny Boyle's first feature since Slumdog Millionaire (2008). The same motif of entrapment stemming from lone attempts at glory fills much of Boyle's work. The results are shown in Shallow Grave (1994), Salim's demise in Slumdog, and Richard's attempts to outfox Sal in The Beach (2000). In some ways, the surreal realities of Trainspotting (1996) and 28 Days Later... (2002) turn this on its head, with the character needing to escape, towards a civilised community.However, it isn't the setting so much that's the appeal with this theme of being trapped in small spaces, but more the character's coping with the event. Aron Ralston (James Franco) is an adventurer. Fearless, enthusiastic and resourceful, it seems that he doesn't need anyone – it's this that becomes the premise for what's to come. How far does being a loner, in spite of your own resourcefulness, really get you? It's difficult not to draw reference to the political climate. A glimpse of Ralston's boss's t-shirt tells us ""They can't lay us off if they can't find us"". Boyle himself has maintained lifelong Labour sympathies, which can account for the focus on community (or the lack of it) that drives the film. In a life or death situation, Ralston comes to realise that resourcefulness and will might prevail, but that individualism landed him there. 'Checking in' now and then might have avoided the whole fiasco.This is typical Boyle fare from the outset, exhibiting an MTV-style montage of soda, beer, and fast-food. It works as a kind of visual ""Choose life..."" The gore (for which a fair amount of the audience are here primarily to see) is near-meticulous in it's attempts to qualify this as surgery: the camera constantly returning the severing of the nerve. These fast paced cuts of close-up, which include a number of unnecessary microscopic scenes of water, perspiration, urine leaving their points of origin, recall to some extent moments of terror in 28 Days Later. It's visceral soundtrack (scored by A.R. Rahman of Slumdog) and (akin to Cillian Murphy's desperate hero) Franco's intensity supports this. Not short of new, more technically demanding ways to visually show the vastness of middle-American desert, Boyle's never been one for allowing his audience time to contemplate - this is what distinguishes Sean Penn's understandably compared, but superior, Into the Wild (2007).What Slumdog offered the viewer in terms of a rarely transmitted, transcultural showpiece, was marred slightly with cliché. High-octane throughout, 127 Hours amalgamation of contemporary media phenomenons, while subtle in its assessment of the Western socio-political landscape, doesn't feel quite so important. Franco will quite rightly earn praise to add to his growing repertoire for his portrayal of the all-American wanderer. Boyle on the other hand - following a church floor covered with the walking-dead, the brutal blinding of a slum child, and now a severed limb left somewhere in the Utah desert – continues to struggle to reach the affect of Trainspotting.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Give this man an Oscar!,"I can't believe what i just saw. ""127 Hours"" is truly a masterpiece. Danny Boyle did it again. Period. This lesson about surviving can be teach in schools. We can learn from mistakes. For me, Aron Ralston isn't a hero. Aron is a survivor. Mankind is based on surviving in the hardest conditions. James Franco truly deserves an Oscar this year. His performance cannot be anything but perfect. It demonstrates a really courage in acting. It takes a lot of motivation and talent to go through the most difficult role, taking over the movie by himself, with a help of the extraordinary direction of Danny Boyle. In this film, James Franco is ""solo"". With the exception of some minor, but solid roles, he owns ""127 Hours"". You can feel Aron's desperation and also you can see the long string of decisions that leads him to amputate the damaged arm. The hand of Aron becomes his worst enemy. So he cut it, to set free. Danny Boyle's unique style of directing is getting more and more amazing, from start to end. ""127 Hours"" is simply great. With this role, James Franco gets in to the big league of newly actors. He did a lot of great acting jobs, but this is masterful. He can put natural feelings in his role, and the transformation is very visible. James Franco is not acting, is living the drama of Aron Ralston at a permitted level of understanding. Give this man an Oscar! He really deserve the golden statue! ""127 Hours"" can easily be the film of 2011. You did it again, Mr. Danny Boyle! As of Mr. James Franco, you can steal the Oscar and still remain innocent! Why? You deserve it!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Entertaining movie, very cheap, worth your time.","So you read the synopsis, good. Anyhow this movie is worth sitting down to, it will leave you thinking about the pain, the courage and the determination needed to survive this situation. If you have seen ""Saw"" then there at least one scene where frustration and the will to survive will leave you wanting to take more bathroom brakes in order to not see what the gruesomeness happening on screen (however if you like this stuff then you'll enjoy it even more).If you have seen ""I shouldn't be alive"" then this is an episode on steroids, however much less happening and a lot of the time is wasted in hallucinations of the main character due to the situation. In went too much in depth in terms of character development, one that while entertaining not necessary.Great work by the writers making a whole movie out of this.Overall, you won't be disappointed if you're expecting to sit for a movie with rating 6 or 7 out of ten.If you liked it, then watch ""I shouldn't be alive"" the episodes are shorter and there is much more going on.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Another movie where you probably know the ending going in, but keeps you entertained and watching.  Very good movie.  I say B+","A true story of a man (Franco) who gets his arm stuck after falling into a canyon and discovers the will to live. After falls into a canyon in the middle of nowhere, a boulder falls and smashes his arm between it and the canyon wall. Little food and water and no one knowing where he is he fights to escape. For the 2 or 3 of you who don't know how it ends I won't ruin it, but this movie really explores the human condition and shows what we can overcome if we really want to. This is a movie like ""Castaway"" and ""Buried"" as it involves basically one person the entire movie. The movie keeps you entertained the entire time, and it is a very tense situation. There are large chunks of the movie that have no dialog, but unless you realize there is no talking you don't really notice it. Franco does a great job with this part and is very enjoyable to watch. Very worthy of a best picture nomination. This is not a movie to just put in and watch, this is one you have to prepare for, the ending is very intense. I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - I might, but this is another movie that would lose the impact in repeat viewings.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not as good as expected,"Overall pretty good movie. Was slow at times, almost boring, but always bounced back. I realize that films made with 99% of the shots on one person have to be a little hard to keep interesting. Based on that, it was done well. Gave some intense scenes, and made me think about what choice I might make if put into his situation! James Franco did an excellent job, though. Before this movie, I had only seen him in comedies, but he does very well in dramatic roles, too. As of now, I've seen him play numerous different characters, but 127 Hours is the first film to make me take him seriously as an actor.

127 hours,"This movie is about a young man who had lived an extremely bad event when he went on a trip. When I began to watch this movie, I didn't guess a theme like in the movie but it is really interesting and worth to see. 127 hours is a psychological and tragic movie and sometimes it may be boring. Because it has a few scenes and mostly, there is a scene and it is showed generally. Apart from these, I shocked when I learned that this movie is taken from in an real event. I didn't know it before and even after I watched movie. After I learned it, all of scenes of the movie came to my mind and it really difficult, depressing, incredible and painful situation. I said to myself that it is a big courage. There is a young man and while he was walking around, he dropped in a place where is 50 meters under of the ground and whose arm pressed between two rocks and he stayed in that situation along 127 hours. Then he had to cut his arm to survive and finally, he was saved by a family. This should be really interesting experience and event and everybody can not do it even for their life.

Meaningful ?,"Many may say that this movie (which is based, as far as i read in FAQ, on real facts - autobiography) is meaningful or emotional or a way of understanding the aspects of life better or anything. I strongly disagree with all these statements.Even if this movie is based on true story, the way it presents the course of events is totally problematic, in my opinion. Everything seem so unreal and unrealistic even to the extent to think that this movie was underestimating the watcher's intelligence. Besides being really boring, this film shows in fact nothing meaningful or deep. It's only ""strength"" is that it is based on a true story. But, on the whole, it's maybe the worst movie i have seen so far this year at least (and i have seen quite a lot, to be honest). I consider it a mere stupidity and that watching this is just a bad way of spending your time.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
You should not miss this,"My score 4/5 There are good movies and then there are great movies. There shouldn't be an epic plot or dozens of well known cast in order for one to be a great one. But it's a must to be something new and should have the capacity to explore the deepest human emotions and ability to inject them directly in to the viewers blood. '127 hours' has all that packed with adrenalin gushing truly painful 94mts.The story is very simple and straight forward. Aron Ralston (Played by James Franco – Spider Man) who is a mountain climber sets off climbing in Utah with high spirits as usual on a one fine Saturday. But he finds himself to be in a death defying situation soon after he met with an accident and trapped in between boulders with a big rock crushing his arm. Now he faces the challenge of getting out alive before he runs out of supplies and most importantly his state of mind. (This situation which immediately reminds me of the similar Discovery- I shouldn't be alive Episode 'trapped under a boulder'. Though it has some resemblance it's important to know that both of them are true life stories and very unique at some points. Recommended!)The script is so strong that it will eventually force you to experience what Aron is going though. What kind of pain he must be bearing up and what emotions, hallucinations and memories he eventually gets trapped in. And most importantly what a man will become and can become when he is faced with the greatest challenge of his life. Aron at times looses hope and record himself saying sorry and good bye to his parents on the camcorder he has but on the next moment he mutter to himself 'Do not loose it' and struggle to overcome the situation. James Franco does a breath taking job making this character plain impossible to forget.Coming from the once Oscar winning director of 'Slumdog Millionaire' Danny Boyle '127 Hours' is not at all a disappointment. Trust me it can be very hard to watch when the real ordeal roll out but if you manage to get though them with one piece of mind then I'm sure you will feel how heroic you are when everything is over.Cinematographically very challenging to pull off which mostly takes place in a very tight space with most of the close up shots, the job is well done. Time to time it gives you some space when Aron's memories comes alive and the sets take place elsewhere but you are quickly returned to the tight spot abandoning all your craziest hopes of escape.'127 hours' is not a super hero movie or even a story of a real life hero. It's a story of a person like you and me with ambitions and interests who suddenly finds himself to be in a situation where he has to make real hard decisions to live further. Once the movie finished we all feel glad that he made correct decision even how hard it maybe. And that's something for all of us to keep in mind. The most important decisions in life are not the easiest ones but they will make you live stronger afterwords.more of my reviews at flickshout.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Deeply moving and well written.,"Originally I didn't want to watch this film since I know the story. I mean, it is basically a story about a guy trapped in a canyon by a rock for 127 hours. However, I was pleasantly surprised at how well this movie was scripted with flashbacks, hallucinations, etc... and with a very deep philosophical theme as a man confronts himself, his past, and present in the face of his own mortality.The story is deeply moving as we witness what it takes for a man to change his ways and grab on to his future.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A modern day masterpiece.,"An amazing portrayal of a real-life story, this movie shows the devastating reality that a few choices and circumstance can do.

No Oscar win? Shame on them.,"This movie was simply amazing! James Franco's performance is shockingly natural, hilarious and even scary at some points. The film tells the true story of a man, Aron who is stuck in a canyon with one bottle of water for over five days, without telling anyone where he went. Judging by the plot, the film could've sucked, could've been average, but it was over the top.Danny Boyle showed us many times before that he is a genius, now he has proved it. All the shots are spectacular, the way of storytelling is interesting and the film is amusing, exciting and moving. It shows the suffering of Aron in a very naturalistic way, you feel the same way he does. I don't recommend this film for those, who can't take much, but it is truly a masterpiece.Don't get me wrong, I loved The King's Speech too (it truly deserved to win the Oscar), but this film somehow had a greater impression on me.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
127 Hours,"I did not have the stomach for this film, Director Danny Boyle has no problem showing us the brutal gore and torture real life Aron Ralston went through and the arm cutting scene is just horrifically shocking.

Emotional to anyone that has ever ventured out,"I just watched this movie for the second time and enjoyed it even more than the first time. Normally watching a true story a second time is anticlimactic knowing how it ends but this movie is not about a surprise or shock at the end but was purely a story of determination and survival.I read several reviews on this movie prior to writing this one and it was either loved or hated. I think it has to do with the viewers perspective. For me it was very emotional. That may be that I have hiked most of my life and can somewhat relate to the shock of realizing that something horrible has just happened and the process by which reality sets in. The heart of the movie for me was the emotional stages he goes through as he progresses through the emotions of shock, anger, fear, loss of reality, then resolute. To those that have never really ventured out or put themselves it possible danger one might think it was 2 hours of foolish self narrative. For anyone that has ever wondered about the limits of human determination this is a must watch. Give it a chance.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
As Good As It Could Be,"127 Hours has a compelling premise of a story, but is limited by the very nature of the story. It's basically a solo journey where the viewer already knows where it's going and how it ends. Despite those considerable limitations 127 Hours is still an interesting viewing in that I was continually asking myself 'what would I do in that situation'. James Franco does a great job and his performance really makes the film work to the degree that it does. Boyle's directing style works here and adds movement and action to scenes that might otherwise have felt static. Those curious about 127 Hours should give it a viewing and see for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Thrilling, Vibrant, Visceral, Challenging","The best decision Danny Boyle took with this film was embracing the idea that Aron Ralston - in the film at least - is not a pleasant person with whom to spend time. As a result the film shares some DNA with Seinfeld, the show where nothing happens and it was an article of faith that the characters never learned anything. The plot here is minimal and whilst Ralston's journey through the 127 hours is portrayed vividly and painfully, there is no epiphany, no great moment of clarity. By the film's end, the most the movie's on-screen text can say is that he always leaves a note to say where he's going these days.Clearly, this is an event that would have changed Ralston to some degree, but that's not the film's focus. Boyle is one of the most urbanised of film directors, and that's on full display even here, a film that spends most of its time in the wilderness. The blistering opening to the film, not to mention many of Ralston's fantasies and hallucinations, emphasises this urban character, a man from the city - and hence heighten his isolation. It all means that we enter into his plight more fully and viscerally - this become a film about empathy. We don't have to especially like Ralston to feel what he's going through emotionally, physically and spiritually. The concern is not so much if he is changed as if we are - do we allow this to transform our understanding of empathy? We don't have to like someone to empathise with them; we 'simply' need to enter into their pain alongside them, which this film forces us to do.Franco's performance is good enough but this is a film belonging squarely to Boyle - and his editor, cinematographer, sound designer and composer and music co-ordinator. Vibrant, challenging, thrilling and engaging, it's a film that surprises as much as it haunts the viewer afterwards - and challenges us to consider exactly whom we're willing and able to feel empathy for.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gritty and intense,"This movie is a very engaging thriller adventure drama starring James Franco and based on a true story about a man who is pinned while rock climbing in a ravine and struggles to stay alive and escape.James Franco gives one of the strongest performances of his career in my opinion holding almost the entire length of the movie on his own. The cinematoraphy besides the cam cording sessions was very good. Imagining yourself in these situations always helps to connect with the central character as well.I'd recommend this movie to anyone wanting an engaging experience that is a little gritty and intense but also at the heart a tale of survival.Acting A-

127 Hours Between A Rock And A Hard Place,"The incredibly versatile Danny Boyle has done it once again. With '127 Hours' he continues to prove that he can tackle any genre and make something amazing. '127 Hours' tells the story of adventurer Aron Ralston (played stupendously by James Franco) who was literally stuck between a rock and a hard place. In this film, Boyle questions many issues, like how ignoring a swiss army knife could have made a huge difference, how people take their parents for granted and how, when it comes to survival, almost anything is worth sacrificing.The film starts off with various split screen cuts before introducing Aron. Then it becomes energetic after Aron's introduction as he's ready to seek some adventure. This reminded me of documentaries about adventurers that I had watched on Discovery Channel, except with more sophisticated camera-work and editing. Speaking of cinematography, it is simply first rate. In addition, A.R. Rahman's score is fantastic.Once Aron finds himself between a rock and a hard place, the overall tone of the film changes, from energetic to intense. Boyle effectively makes this transformation but at the same time he manages to keep a balance. There are some interesting shots such as the closeups of water being sucked out of the bottle or urine being deposited in a flask. The odd closeups of Franco's face also works well as the idea was to make it look as though it was shot with homemade camera.Danny Boyle has been one of my all-time favourite directors and he never fails to positively surprise me with his films. '127 Hours' is no exception.",,Anonymous,Biography
Excellently made..,"I was lucky enough to see this film before it hit theaters.. Instantly, just when the film opened with Free Blood's song Never Hear Surf Music again, I knew I was going to love it. Most films like this have its boring intro.. Well, this one doesn't.

This film is a true story it does say it is based on a book written by the man who encountered this terrifying experience. I will not go into detail about the ending though. But yes, if you do hear the ending, do NOT let that discourage you from watching it! I knew the ending from reading things about the true story, I remember the news paper article when it happened. Anyway, back to way this is so great. The camera angles blew me away, I love the camera angles while he is on his bike.. Now, this film is rated R for a good reason.

Slipping through the cracks,"Avoided this movie for some time mainly as I was sceptical that the subject matter could sustain 90-odd minutes without resorting to incessant flashbacks or some tawdry, laboured struggle. Being pinned to a specific location for 127 hours doesn't offer a lot of material to manufacture a 90 minute film, but I'm pleased to say director Danny Boyle has exceeded my own expectations with a taut thriller that's well photographed and exceptionally well-acted by the often maligned James Franco.Despite knowing little of the real-life genesis of this film (though familiar with the 'climax' depicted in much more graphic detail than I anticipated), the unimaginable despair doesn't need a baseline truth to be compelling. This is one of those films where apparently, truth is stranger than fiction. Franco's trademark nonchalance is an attribute to his character here, and he does manage to affect the contrast well, as his situation becomes more dire.If there was one disappointment, it was that I didn't get to see more of Kate Mara, whose character failed to evolve despite its potential. Great movie, well-constructed, visually appealing and a decent soundtrack.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Doesn't have a great affect if you already know the ending, but still enjoyable","The fact that almost everyone knows the outcome and events that are going to occur before watching the movie takes away a lot of the suspense and emotions that one would normally feel towards the film. Since we all know the story of Aron Ralston, the movie just seemed like a really good reenactment of the situation. However, if you don't already know the story then the movie would be great. I still believe it was a good movie and a powerful one as well. James Franco was great and it surprisingly did not get boring considering the movie consisted of one main character and setting. Overall, it was good while it lasted but didn't stick with me and have the same affect as it would if i did not know everything that was going to happen.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

don't believe the hype,"this movie is terrible.if you want to see a movie that manages to make a dull situation exciting then go watch ""Buried"". this is a waste of money and time.i am not talking about the experience that this person had in real life but about the the movie that resulted from it. there is absolutely no suspense.the boring flashbacks are pointless because they never give us a feel for who we are dealing with and at no stage does the movie manage to create a true feeling of sympathy for the main protagonist.no emotions come up and the main character seems cold.you never get the feeling that he is afraid or longing for his family and loved ones or that he even has the will to really survive. on top of that the flashbacks are confusing and do nothing to further the plot in any way. the cinematography and soundtrack were the only thing special about this movie and i still feel that it was used way too much to distract from the dullness of the story.merely the last 5min created any kind of excitement in this more than sub par movie. i had high hopes and expectations for this flick but it was a major let down. maybe if you get really high before watching it you can enjoy this.but if u don't smoke up like me you are out of luck",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

We descend into his lonely hell with him and emerged amazed by the resilience of this young man in particular, but also by life in general.

Interesting Use of Cinematography from Anthony Dod Mantle,"The story line of 127 Hours is that a man backpacking alone becomes trapped by a rock in a canyon in Utah, and must figure out how to survive. The movie is mostly visually driven, which makes it interesting to focus on the work of the cinematographer, Anthony Dod Mantle. Mantle's methods for recording this film make the movie almost experimental.Mantle never holds the same shot for very long. Within seconds, there is camera movement or a change in angle. The camera goes above, below, besides, next to, and pans past characters. Some shots are at unusual angles. There are pan and zoom combinations that move from the landscape to the main character, Aron, and vise versa. Mantle shows off the rock formations with multiple shots so wide, Aron becomes a silhouette. Little time is spent on an average shot of a character's whole face. Instead, Mantle cuts to closeups of hands, feet, eyes, objects, people's shadows, and shots from the characters' point of view. Instead of cutting to each character's face during conversations, the camera moves between characters as if it was another person standing there. Changes in camera angle are also used to subtly cut out unnecessary points in the story without changing the setting. Additionally, there are many frames within a frame, and in these moments, Mantle often shows both sides of the frame. Parts of locations that the camera looks through include cabinets, openings in rocks, tree branches, and a car window while the interior was dim. Mantle also uses the camera to view what the eye would not normally see, like inside a water bottle or Aron's camcorder while a new clip loads.Aron's camcorder becomes another view for the audience to look through as his vlogging occasionally takes up the screen. When Aron takes photos, the scene pauses, and the photo shrinks and slides offscreen. The camcorder also becomes something for Aron to talk in order to include dialogue when no other people are around.The movie has very little dialogue. In fact, almost all the deleted scenes included on a DVD version of the movie were the dialogue driven. One deleted scene has Aron talk about his options, but in the movie, he acts them out or the audience watches what he imagines. While there are points where a little more dialogue would have made a scene easier to understand, dialogue heavy scenes would have distracted the audience from the visual focus of this film. Instead of talking to move the story or give context, the audience is given text to mark the days, music with lyrics, visual hints, and Aron's thoughts and memories. By playing out Aron's thoughts, Mantle is able to take the audience out of the canyon, even though Aron is still trapped there. The memories also bring characters for Aron to interact with. The present Aron sometimes appears on screen with the opacity turned down to make him ghost-like on top of memories or daydreams of life outside cave. Memories further blend with the present when other characters and objects from his memories appear in the cave instead of cutting to another setting or changing opacity. His memories are also projected on Aron's eyes or a cloth he puts over his head at one point.The passage of time in the film also relies on visuals. Natural light is almost always used, and puts an emphasis on how much daylight is left. However, there are some indoor scenes with artificial lights and daydreams with dramatic lighting. The changing color of Aron's lips as he stays in the canyon longer is also a way of showing how much time has gone by. This is probably accomplished through applying makeup before shooting.There are more ways the movement of the camera is used. At times, the camera movement is based on Aron's emotions. There are smooth aerial shots as Aron enthusiastically starts his journey. There are shaky, quick movements as Aron tries to desperately free himself. Intentional temporary blurring and distortion of audio are also used to communicate how Aron feels at points. Pans and zooms are used to focus on smaller parts of a scene and reveal what the audience should be looking at.Mantle does something very unique where he splits the screen into thirds that are longer vertically. Sometimes, there is a horizontal shot that continues as two others pop on top. Other times, all three appear together. The thirds of the screen show different angles of the same scene or different times of day along Aron's journey. There is a point where the left and right thirds were mirror images of each other while the middle was something else. By having clips share the screen, Mantle is able to both be creative and make the story move faster by not showing each clip individually.I would recommend watching this movie to see a very creative and purposeful use of cinematography. The film is also interesting because it is based on a true story. However, I must warn you that it does get unexpectedly gruesome. Don't let the cheerful and comedic opening let you forget this story is about a man struggling to survive. The physical environment drives both the story and visuals, whether due to the sunlight, rock formations, wind, or water. Be prepared for what seems like unneeded shots to foreshadow to events later in the film.While Mantle did a good job at making shots matter, the one negative point I have about the film is in the long part where Aron is trapped, the movie seems a little dragged on. I think the editors should have cut out more of the scenes in the cave and kept some of the expanded ending found in the DVD. While the alternative ending has some great scenes of what happened to Aron later, it proves the saying that the best scenes can hit the cutting room floor.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Had potential, but falls flat.","I felt that that Danny Boyle was the wrong choice to direct this movie.

What you have to see,"The film 127 hours is a biographical drama based on a true story. The film was produced and directed by Danny Boyle in 2010. It stars James Franco, Kate Mara and more. It was nominated for 6 Oscars; it got 23 wins and 150 nominations total.The movie was filmed in the USA, UK and France.127 hours is the true story of mountain climber Aron Ralston's remarkable adventure to save himself after a fallen boulder crashes on his arm and traps him in an isolated canyon in Utah. He spends there about 5 days. Throughout his journey, Ralston remembers his friends, family and lover.I strongly recommend the film because it's an exciting, sensitive and interesting story, which has a good plot.

127 Hours,"A man has his arm trapped in a rock. Sure, it's based on a true story, but it's hardly the best prospect for a two-hour movie. Still, '127 Hours' does a decent enough job of it, particularly thanks to James Franco's performance.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

127 Hours is James Franco's One-Man Show!,"¨The minute I was born, every breath that I've taken, every action has been leading me to this crack on the out surface.¨127 Hours is Danny Boyle's latest film, after his Oscar winning picture, Slumdog Millionaire. His choice was a rather curious one considering the plot is about a man who gets his arm trapped in a crack of a canyon for 127 hours. The plot doesn't seem to be all that attractive and most of us were already familiar with the true story that the film is based on so there was no real room for surprises. So why has the film been nominated for Best Picture? The answer is simple; Danny Boyle is a great director who happened to cast the right man for the lead role: James Franco. Franco gives one of the best performances of the year. He is just great in this film, which is actually a one man show. 127 Hours is only about 90 minutes long, but Franco's character is trapped in the canyon with very little room for mobility from practically the very beginning (15 minutes into the movie) up to the very end. The entire film focuses on Franco with extreme close ups and his facial expressions are just all on the mark. James Franco is the reason why this film got so many great reviews and was nominated. Danny Boyle also made the film more interesting by resorting to flashbacks, daydreams, and hallucinations, but Franco is the main reason why this movie did as well as it did. I wasn't too much of a fan of Boyle's style of splitting the screen in two or three, but it was still visually stunning and the movie is worth the watch (although I disagree with the nomination for Best Picture).The movie is very faithful to Aron Ralston's autobiographical book, ¨Between a Rock and a Hard Place.¨ The screenplay was adapted by Danny Boyle himself and Simon Beaufoy (The Full Monty and Slumdog Millionaire). It tells the true story of an arrogant mountain climber and outdoors person named Aron Ralston (played by James Franco) who goes out as he usually does every weekend after work into the Canyons in Utah. This weekend he happens to be heading towards the Blue John Canyon, and as usual he leaves without telling anyone where he is going. He is a bit of a solitary person who enjoys being outdoors with the nature and is pretty reckless. He arrives to the Canyon on Friday and on his expedition meets two girls Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn) with whom he has a good time and teaches them a thing or two about the site. Little does he know that these will be the last two people he has contact with before the accident. He parts ways with them and starts heading towards the Blue John Canyon crack. Once he arrives and begins descending the crack, a rock falls and lands on his arm, not allowing him to move. He gets stuck in the crack without being able to move the heavy rock and knowing that no one will come searching for him because he hasn't told anyone where he was heading. Aron has hardly any food and only a bottle of water to survive. The title gives away the amount of time Aron remains in the crack, and like I said there are no big surprises because we know the story, but the movie works thanks to Franco.I do not want to give away too much of the film, but most everyone is familiar with Ralston and knows what he does in order to get out (yes he escapes, because if he didn't there would be no autobiography or film so no this isn't a spoiler). I won't say how he does it in case you aren't familiar with it, but all I can say is that it is a very strong and difficult scene to watch. It was really well done and I couldn't help but cringe at the sight of it. It was a very painful scene, but Franco was excellent in it as well. He truly gives a powerful performance, and I won't get tired of repeating it. I can't believe it only took Boyle one take to get it done, it was just perfect. The reason why I'm only giving this film seven out of ten is because I really wasn't hooked by the story. Yes, I liked Franco's performance, but there was nothing new to the story. This would have made for an excellent short film, it would have been perfect, but in 90 minutes I just felt the film was stretched too long. I really didn't care too much for the daydreams or flashbacks; although they did serve the purpose of at least changing the claustrophobic environment for a while. The best scenes were actually the ones in which James Franco would tape his video journal of each day. The one where he imagines he is getting invited to an early TV show and plays the interviewer and himself is just great and proves what a good job Franco did in this movie. I recommend this movie, I just don't agree with the six Oscar nominations it received.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good story.... But!,"Good story.... but would have been better if it was shown in some NAT GEO survival series. I was unlucky to watch it on big screen with 7 colleagues and believe me we had nothing to cheer about. But the good lesson we learned was ""Always leave a note at home when you go for some adventure"" and also..... Do not watch a movie based on only IMDb rating. I think the reason behind such high rating of this movie is only that its based on some true story and the people who watched it were had so much sympathy for the trapped person that they immediately logged into IMDb and gave it rating above 8 lol. Believe me I have watched many better survival stories on Nat Geo.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Boyle-Rahman bandwagon goes beyond expectations!,"Ever since we jumped onto the Boyle-Rahman bandwagon 2 years ago with Slumdog Millionaire, even back then, at least for me, it was hard to fathom the combined strength of this duo. Which brings me back to an amazing concept pointed out by Napoleon Hill called the ""mastermind group""....which literally states that the combined mind powers of a group can generate enough energy and force which is greater than the individual strengths of any single mind. And this is one work by the master duo of Boyle and Rahman which establishes a vibrant and dominant punch,just like Slumdog. The directorial ingenuity of Boyle, added to the musical grace of Rahman, throws them into the ring of other brilliant contemporary directors.A nicely directed film with a prefect plot which reverts close to the actual reality. Sure, Boyle by himself is a maestro in his entirety, and for the heck of it I'm being repetitive here, but Rahman has also always been worth more than his salt, but a killer combination or fusion of the Boyle-ian and Rahman-ian elements generated a power worth more than the common mind could fathom. As far as I was affected, I haven't come across a movie like this which not only grabs you by the throat right into its heart, but dials-up your emotions that you begin to experience something on the likes of anxiety, panic attacks, fear, and all those essential feelings which make it almost impossible for you to stick to your seats and watch with the normal relaxation you would expect. Definitely I would not recommend this movie for the weak-hearted.But how does the Boyle-Rahman formula actually come into play? Sure, we could have removed Rahman and had still a gripping tale which makes our eyes pop out when we see the challenging and grueling battle against the natural elements of isolation, heat , plus the addition of a dwindling water supply and food supply, which Aron has to play out. But the brilliance of the genius in a director combo is truly evaluated by its ability to hide your mind from the reality - the reality that this is acting and not fact. The true brilliance is felt when it draws you under its covers so much, that you begin to feel the powerful emotions which the main protagonist goes through. So much so, that the viewer is drawn into a totally new ""reality"", a reality non-existent. In other words, for those few minutes, the mind cannot even realise that none of this is real. I, for starters, during those ""gory"" moments, found myself unable to keep still, and kept moving around in my seat, wondering how anyone could actually carry that out! Of course, on closer analysis, it's evident that it's not just what is projected on the screen which triggers this adrenalin rush, and makes one register on the emotional richter scale, but also the music eclat which really helps manifest the true plight, emotions, agony, challenge, despair,faced by Aron Ralston, and even more, bring all these beyond the big screen and actually inject these feelings into us! A brilliant job by Rahman........kudos to you!All it takes is your musical genius to give this movie a white-knuckle finish and make us actually ""live"" it!A truly daedal killer scheme for direction and music.Of course, the 127 Hours effect wouldn't be complete without giving true commendation to James Franco's brilliant acting. Thorughout the film, his professional brilliance and dexterous acting never let up which themselves contribute to creating a riveting appeal for the film. This becomes particularly eminent when the climax of the film begins to surface, that is, from the moment Aron gets trapped in the canyon unable to free his arm. The novelty of the portrayal of his flashback memories becomes clear when it becomes hard to decipher exactly the points when Aron drifts from reality into flashback and back. Being part of the audience, it was very difficult for my mind to get a handle on what was reality and what was hallucination. This is the combined work of the direction and cinematography which go hand in hand to create such an effect on the mind that the line between the reality and imagination on the screen gets totally blurred!I can positively say, beyond the shadow of doubt, that Boyle and Rahman provide a holistic approach towards their own creation or rather genre which helps stir up those emotions that put our minds right in the heart of the film and make us live those powerful moments. And nice work, which has generated enough Oscar buzz that it remains to be seen how well it can compete against the other potential candidates. This is one film which speaks of novelty on all fronts - direction, cinematography, music, and last but not least, star acting!And if we thought Slumdog Millionaire was gung-ho enough, we now realise that Boyle and Rahman are crossing over towards the pinnacle of their success as a duo.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not Boyle's best movie but sure one of Franc's best performances.,"When James Franco is not busy doing spectacular comedies with his buddy Seth Rogen he chooses to deal with interesting projects. And this movie is one of them. 127 hours is a story of survival and the desire to live. But it's also a movie based on real events and as we know this is a lot of times really risky to adapt to the big screen. Fortunately the director of the movie is long time favorite Danny Boyle. Trainspotting's talented is aware of the risks and he makes all the right moves making the film enjoyable. He makes the movie short and straight to the point with the right amount of thrills and a little bit of light hearted comedy in the start. But the most important aspect of the movie it's the one man performance from the main star. James Franco for me is a mediocre actor. But he is a smart guy. He chooses his steps really carefully and most of the times the results are spot on. This happens also in ""127 hours"". He manages to lift the whole movie in his shoulders and captivates you with his entire presence for 90 minutes. I'm not really font of biopic movies myself but I have to say this film made me have a really good time. It has its thrills and is a fine tribute to human resolve. It's not of course Danny Boyle's best movie but is a nice movie overall and it will make you stay in your seat for it's entire time.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Powerful and beautiful,"Director Danny Boyle made a simple and straightforward premise - a mountain climber trapped in a narrow passage trying to make it out alive - into a masterpiece of cinematic work that is 127 Hours. The film transports the audience into the character's world and makes us feel immensely for him. You could feel his physical and emotional pain, his desperation, his hallucination - the entire experience of 127 Hours was created in such a way the audience felt directly in the character's shoes. The infamous climax scene got me recoiled and winced with pain - such reaction no gore horror or violent action film has ever elicited from me.Needless to say, besides Danny Boyle's brilliant camera-work, it was James Franco's intense and terrific acting that made 127 Hours the masterful work it is. One drawback I felt though was of the film's length - perhaps the experience could have been more powerful had the film run for 120 minutes.127 Hours, a thought-provoking, harrowing, inspiring, beautiful and brilliant film, will leave the audience in breathless awe and high in spirits. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
film's production is too stylish,"Coming off the similar but very sparse Open Water (8/10) I found the hyper-stylised production of 127 Hours quite jarring. What works in urban culture ensembles like Trainspotting doesn't necessarily fit with a solo-survival story.You've got 'trendy' music (sounds outdated already) all over the place, digitally-enhanced zooming and hectic edits which reminded me of Quantum Solace in that you couldn't quite follow the action. Even the famous epiphany scene wasn't as clearly-directed as it should've been (apparently Boyle wanted it to be, so maybe he should have a word with his editor).On top of all that there's a hyper-active cowboy as the main character who's an überwired I-LOVE-LIFE sort, effortlessly making couch potatoes like me feel guilty. Just check out the slide into the idyllic pool scenes with the girls at the beginning, surely it was only a matter of time before one of them bashes their head against the wall on the way down? I internally grumped ""you were asking for that, kid"" when he got stuck between a rock and a hard place.But it's not a bad film, to be fair it's pretty decent and most of it is an accurate depiction of what really happened. Franco plays the part very well, and aside from the over-stylising I quite liked the camera work, admittedly some of the drink-fantasy scenes were fairly dynamic to behold (the flooding and quick dash to his girlfriend's front door was well done).Just that personally I like a film of this nature to be sparse & minimal. In Open Water I felt the fear, whereas in 127 Hours my drama-tingles weren't really tingling, perhaps because my senses were often busy with processing audio & visual tricks.Recommended if you like Danny Boyle's style regardless of genre, but if you want a tense & involving survival thriller this could go either way.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It was so explicit, but that was the greatest asset of the film","""Based on extraordinary true story"", says the trailer. The film was true to it's words. I always wonder how difficult it might have been writing about a person trapped in a confined space, and as someone copes with it, I respect them for completing such an uneasy task. Certainly, the acting job by James Franco is amazing. The role he was charged with is not an easy one. It is definitely the film to see. The main winning factor is the idea it renders: the will to live and survive any hopeless situation; that fate can be beaten, if the will-power tries hard. Even so, almost one hour watching of the struggles of a person who tries to get released may be not for everyone. '127 Hours' is a great film with a great lead. The greatest treasure of the film is the message it conveys, which makes it a definite must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Inspiring,"I entered the cinema prepared for what I will go through. A story of a person, Aron Ralston, trapped in canyon for 5 days. The story told in a big canvas to bring out his grief and self-pity lines. I couldn't be more wrong.For a movie with such a premise, it starts of with an amazing musical split screen shots. The first few minutes are a real treat to the eyes, and you get loads of that treat throughout the movie. Split screens, orange sand, the bluer skies and the bluest waters, the visuals just leave you gasping for more.Danny Boyle doesn't waste time getting into the real story, and the expected fall happens unexpectedly to the viewer with no drama or a dramatic score. There is a brilliant musical score, but silence has been used to a good effect. Surprisingly, once Aron is trapped with the boulder, its not tears and pity all the way. There is humor, self- analysis, struggle, desperation, frustration, planning – a bouquet of human emotions. There is also a point in the film, where even in the deepest hour of crisis Aron is tempted to pleasure himself. I haven't read the book by Aron Ralston, but the movie definitely makes you feel like you are seated in front of him during his crisis. James Franco deserves accolades for his brilliant performance. It's astonishing to see Danny Boyle come out with this amazing biopic, after an India Cinema inspired pot boiler. The narration and the detailing is praise worthy. A R Rahman's music is different and sets the mood of the film. The score is more emotional at times and uses a lot of other composers' tracks.There is a very hard and disturbing scene, of about few moments, towards the end of the movie which would not be suitable for very weak hearted people. Discount that, this is movie of true hope and courage. Loved the movie. Don't miss this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""127 Hours"" is the most intense film to be released in recent years!","In ""127 Hours,"" James Franco plays Aron Ralston, an extreme sport enthusiast with a love for adventure. The film starts off with Ralston planning a huge trip through Canyonlands National Park in Utah. At the beginning of his journey, Aron meets up with Kristi and Megan, who are also looking for some adventure. Aron and the girls share a fun filled day together full of swimming and some hiking. By nightfall, Megan and Kristi part ways and invite Aron to come to a party a few days away. Aron says, he will see if he can make it and that's where the real adventure begins. Aron, now alone ventures deep into the Canyonlands where he falls into an isolated canyon only to find his arm trapped by a boulder. What happens for the next hour and 30 minutes is the remarkable true tale of one man doing anything he can to save himself. An intense film ensues...First and foremost, ""127 Hours"" is based on a true story of Aron Ralston. The film itself is based on his autobiography ""Between A Rock and Hard Place""and the story is nothing short of fascinating. As far as the movie goes, Danny Boyle really makes ""127 Hours,"" a unique and intensive movie going experience, which I give him a huge amount of credit for. As a film lover, I realize that a film about a guy stuck in a canyon for 93 minutes isn't an easy sell nor would many think it would make for an intense and exciting movie.Boyle using his directing and writing skills makes ""127 Hours"" probably one of the most intense films I have seen in years. I love how Boyle made the beginning of the film feel all upbeat and lighthearted. While I was watching this film with my fiancée it was funny because in the first five minutes of the film we looked at each other and said ""what is this?"" It seemed like a nice little film about this adventurous guy who meets up with two women and goes on adventures with them. The film sets its audience up for the unexpected. You think your getting a feel good film but after the first 10 minutes you are just glued to the edge of your seat in suspense.As I said above, about 10 minutes in, Aron falls down the hole and I thought to myself ""oh great this is going to be so boring now because all now he is stuck in a hole. The reason I thought this is because of previous films, which feature people being stuck and how dull they were to watch. One film I instantly thought of was ""World Trade Center"" directed by Oliver Stone. That film was so long and boring that after a while the audience just didn't care. With this film, Boyle made it interesting because not only did he use flashbacks but he also showed the thoughts running through Aron's mind. The way Boyle does this perfect because he doesn't overuse any of the resources he has. It does a good mix between the actual situation, flashbacks, and visions, which help make this film more intense than any horror film I have seen in recent years.The movie would not be nearly as good without Franco in the lead. Franco is an interesting actor because he started off playing very random roles but then got popular in comedies. Now, Franco seems to go back and forth with comedy and drama. I think this role was perfect for him. Franco fits the look, the build, and even the personality for the film. I didn't think I would ever say Franco deserves an Oscar but he just might for this film. I think a lot of that goes into the solid story and direction of Boyle but it also proves to me at least that Franco has a lot of talent and has what it takes to be a big star.""127 Hours"" proves to me that a good simple story can go a long way with the right people taking on the material. This film is a remarkable and intense film that leaves you as an audience member just sitting on the edge of your seat wondering whats going to happen next. We all heard about the end scene and it's probably one of the most disgusting scenes I have ever seen. I think this scene is so hard to watch because of how real the film is. This isn't a special effects film, it's not about some weird killer, or anything else far-fetched and overused. This is a real story about real people. As I said in the beginning of this review, this movie isn't an easy sell but Boyle turns it into an emotional, edge of your seat film that surely won't disappoint. It takes a talented director, writer and cast (even though small) to make a film like ""127 Hours"" work and this is one film everyone involved should be very proud of.MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""127 Hours"" is a solid 9 out of 10. It definitely ranks up there as one of the best films of 2010 and is definitely the most intense!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Danny Boyle does it again,"Here is a film where had it of been directed by someone else, the overall result would differ completely. Of-course each director is different but Danny Boyle has his own style that separates his films from others even if the story is may not be truly original. It's his style that makes 127 Hours a great film because there are so many ways that you can tell the story but he brings a sense of energy to the film that would not have been present if another director had made this.Similar to Cast Away, the film really does focus on the lead character, played by James Franco who is brilliant and deserved his Oscar nomination. He encapsulates the adrenaline fueled explorer perfectly where no mountain is too high for him and more importantly you like him. Its easy to sympathise with someone in the position that he finds himself in but his personality adds something to the film.What also makes the film stand-out is the cinematography and editing that can really pump up the tension. The film starts off colourful where everything is bright and full of life but by the end, the image has become dry as the hours build up.127 Hours is a film worthy of your attention. While the story may sound grim, and it does get pretty intense, the film should not be passed on.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Boyle's best yet. Mesmerizing, Unforgettable, and ultimately Excellent","Danny Boyle already has an Oscar under his belt for his incredible direction in Slumdog Millionaire. While I thought Boyle himself did amazing in Slumdog, I never truly fell in love with the film itself. In 28 Days Later Boyle also proved that he is able to command films with a true power and beauty, and to this day it remains one of the most influential horrors of the last 10 years. Here in 127 Hours, Boyle is again working full force and makes what is his best film yet.I have seen many films of this type before but that doesn't mean a film like this is unoriginal or trite. It is based on a book that is based on a true story about a young man who is trapped beneath a canyon in a boulder. The story is simple, so it goes without saying that the screenplay has to come to life with a director willing to put a visual and realistic stamp on it. Here comes Boyle, who is able to visually command his films in a certain unique way. The film is never once dull because we are here watching Boyle and Franco do a career-best performance behind the camera and in front. Franco is powerful and I am very glad that he was able to star in a film like this where he is the only true cast and has to actually perform under imaginary difficult circumstances.Like I said before, Boyle puts a visual stamp on his film so it makes it stand out from other films of this type. The cinematography is incredible, as is the music score.

The movie plays out like he's some college freshman party boy, recklessly running around in the desert until he gets his arm stuck. To be honest, there's not a whole lot that happened other than the basics of the incident that are true.I still think the story is amazing and I suppose it was cool to see it play out in movie form.

127 Hours: Being Stuck Literally and Metaphorically,"I knew I was going to like this movie, it has James Franco on the lead who is both charismatic and talented and the crew behind the camera are also masterful. What I wasn't expecting was the depth of the story. Aron is stuck in his current life mentally and then he gets stuck physically and the movie does make a great job connecting these things. This movie seems like it really happened(I know it actually happened but some biographies just mess this up and even facts might sound impossible) and the phases Aron goes through are shot and directed beautifully. His memories really add a lot to this movie. The thing I liked the most about this movie is how it arranges its time. I expected a formula of 10 minutes-(10 hours later)- 10 minutes which really wouldn't fit this movie. For example, we see Franco trying to escape and we get the fact that he spent 3 hours doing this activity which proves the masterful editing in this movie. The comedy in this movie is also unironically really good. I think the first 15 minutes of the movie could have been cut into 3 minutes which is pretty annoying to think about when the movie is less than 90 minutes(if you cut the credits). The movie had some parts which could've been cut or stretched. These parts(especially some of the memories) progress throughout the movie but then the movie ends before they create an important message. So, the things I like the most and the least are about time. Time structure of the movie isn't good but the representation of how time passes in the canyon is awesome.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kudos to James Franco.,"127 Hours depicts the true story of a guy named Aron Ralston, who went canyoneering in Utah in April 2003. Through a pretty serious event of misfortune, he gets trapped in a canyon by a boulder that pulverises his arm against the canyon wall; literally between a rock and a hard place. And, the desperate measures he resorts to in order to free himself. From a Hollywood perspective, this sounds like it could be turned into a wildly spectacular action film with a bold, heroic protagonist, hysterical relatives and ""Where is my son? PLEASE FIND MY SON!!"" *intense sobbing* - type of dialogue. Yes? No. Boy, am I glad this was directed by Danny Boyle... The man we all know for his raw, authentic film style. Instead of aforementioned blockbuster drama, he opted for an incredibly realistic, documentary-like film. 127 Hours starts off with no form of introduction whatsoever. We do not get to 'meet' Aron or any of his relatives. However, any such introduction quickly proves to be redundant as, over the fast-paced opening credits, we see Aron enthusiastically preparing for and taking off on a hiking trip (ignoring his mother's phone call in the process...), and there you have it: this is a 'too cool for school', overconfident adrenaline junkie, and that's all we need to know. This overconfidence gradually proves to be the source of pretty much all his problems, as it is later on revealed that Aron neglected to tell anyone where he was going... Oops.Like I said, this film looks and feels very much like a documentary, like National Geographic made a big budget reconstruction of the event. The film makers' choice to cast James Franco was a very good one. He is simply amazing. Mind you – he is alone in this film for about 95% of the time. This requires an actor with the guts and skill to carry an entire film, and I must admit, Franco probably wouldn't have been my first choice. But – to my pleasant surprise – he pulls it off, and is actually very worthy indeed of his Oscar nomination. He displays an impressively wide range of emotions, all equally convincing. Panic, disbelief, despair, delusion, hurt and hallucinations. But even confidence, coolness, exhilaration and rationality; it's all there. Aron Ralston, as a character, starts off as a seemingly quite cocky, confident, care-free dude who just wants to enjoy himself and do what he loves most: exploring nature. Without telling his family. But as the film progresses, and Aron realises just what kind of mess he's in, you can slowly see a change occurring in him. And the fact that, after a while you greatly start to sympathize with him and even admire him, despite his obvious stupidity before, is all due to James Franco. He has really proved himself to be a very fine character actor with the capability of moving his audience. There is one scene in particular which I found really captivating. During the 'Tuesday' scene, Aron records himself on his camcorder, acting like he's on a talk show, answering his own questions. This scene is top-notch, acting wise, and this is where you really start to feel for him.Throughout Aron's ordeal, we are shown various flashbacks of his childhood, friends, family and loves. This might seem like a cliché, but honestly, what else are you supposed to think about when you're stuck in a canyon for five days? Some people on the boards and in other reviews have said they think Aron to be a superficial person for not having some kind of spiritual enlightenment while he was trapped, but I just want to voice my own personal opinion on that matter. Honestly, I don't think it's anybody's business to judge what Aron thought and felt throughout his ordeal. We all deal with hardship in our own personal way, and talking to God is not necessarily an option for everyone. Some of us simply draw support from family and love and good memories. I know that's what I'd do.Now, back to technical talk. The sense of realism of 127 Hours comes greatly from the grainy, unsteady camera work and graphic depiction of everything. Which is a note that comes with a warning: this film is not for the faint of heart. What surprised me is that the scene where Aron 'releases' himself is visually very graphic. I won't go into detail, but you really shouldn't watch this if you don't have the stomach.There were only a few minor things which bothered me during this film. It has a few moments which, inevitably are a bit boring. But then again, even that seems to fit into the story, so perhaps it makes sense. And I personally think the music wasn't always very well chosen, some of it didn't really fit somehow. But none of this is really any bother.127 Hours may not be as profound as Into the Wild, but it's certainly a very well-crafted film which deserves respect on its own merits. Also, the photography of the film is really beautiful and some of the scenery of the canyons is truly breathtaking. I would recommend it for the pretty pictures alone. Anyhow, if you're interested in a really good episode of ""I shouldn't be alive"", this is the film for you.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

127 Hours is one hell of a ride,"Plot Summary: In Danny Boyle's127 Hours, Aron Ralston (James Franco) is stuck in the penultimate ""between a rock and a hard place"" scenario: his arm, after an ill fated tumble down a slot canyon, has been trapped between a boulder and the canyon wall. With no means of communicating with the outside world and no hope of rescue (his decision to avoid discussing his travel planes with friends and family wasn't a brilliant move), Aron must find a way to escape his predicament while contemplating the events in his life that lead him to this point.Review: 127 Hours is a rare movie that grabs you by the balls in the first ten seconds and keeps squeezing until the tension is unbearable. Considering the confined corridor the film takes place in, along with the limited cast of characters, this seems like a near Herculean task. But, with Danny Boyle's wiz bang direction and James Franco giving the most entertaining performance of the year, the film moves with a grace unmatched by most modern filmmakers. The cinematography is great, everything from a ""Holy crap this is insane!"" mountain biking montage through beautiful Canyonlands park to the sheer number of different shots used to highlight Aron's predicament while trapped in the canyon. Although spending an hour in a canyon sounds like it would be boring beyond belief, Boyle keeps it interesting through flashbacks that show the experiences that led Aron to become trapped, as well as premonitions of his future should he escape his natural prison. Also punctuated throughout the film are Aron's attempts to escape, ranging from a brutish attempt to dislodge the rock with force to a gradual attempt to erode the rock by picking at it with a knife that pales in comparison to anything the Swiss army would use. These attempts, although ultimately useless, are exhilarating to watch and build nicely to a nerve shattering climax.Of course, all of this would be useless without a lead that could carry the story. Fortunately, Franco is more than up to the task. Jumping between moments of comedy and charisma to soul crushing scenes of defeat and agony, Mr. Franco never misses a beat in a performance that is worthy of all praise being bestowed upon it. Unfortunately, the film isn't without its problems. While some flashback scenes work towards creating a personality for Aron while giving perspective on his past, a large number of them revolving around a past relationship are underdeveloped and do little to deepen the character or put Aron's current situation into some form of context. There are also some poor visual effects in the form of CG ants that torment Aron and a few shots of the trapped arm that accentuate some of its faker features.Despite these minor gripes, 127 Hours is one hell of a ride. Franco's performance is a roller-coaster in and of itself, the movie stays taunt and entertaining throughout, and the jaw dropping cinematography more than makes up for the price of Admission.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Survival In The Utah Badlands,"True-life survival stories often make for compelling films, but it would seem after the idea of ""survivalist"" was appropriated by the highly rated CBS-TV ""reality"" show Survivor that this particular genre had run its course. As any discerning person will attest to, however, Survivor and other like-minded TV shows are really merely game shows or contests roughened up for the participants. Such a fact can be borne out by the artistic success of a film like director Danny Boyle's 127 HOURS, one of the best films of 2010, though it has caused some consternation among film goers for the very method of survival it depicts.The film is based on the experiences of Colorado-born adventurer Aron Ralston (portrayed by James Franco), who had gone out on a cross-country hike in the badlands of southern Utah in late April 2003. He hiked into isolated Bluejohn Canyon some thirty miles outside the Utah town of Moab and, while repelling down a cliff into the bottom of a canyon, dislodged a sizable rock and then slipped. The rock wedged his right arm between it and the wall of the canyon, and he remained stuck there for 127 hours, or just over five days in all. Braving temperatures that ranged from the lower 90s during the day to below 50 degrees at night, he had to be careful how he used his water, and he documented his story and his personal musings on his camcorder, trying very hard to dislodge the rock that was keeping him in place by chipping away at it with a rather cheap made-in-China pocket knife. It only seemed to prolong the agony, because the rock was never dislodged. With very little time left, and his water supply running dangerously low, he was forced to do the unthinkable with that very same knife.Although Boyle, known for such films as TRAINSPOTTING, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE, and the grisly 2002 zombie flick 28 DAYS LATER, makes the same mistake his fellow British director Tony Scott has done on his films via the use of an occasionally loud industrial-type rock score by A.R. Rahman and sometimes jerky camera movements, he mostly sticks to the facts surrounding Ralston's life and ordeal. As portrayed quite well by Franco, Ralston comes off as a fairly cocky young man with a penchant for extreme adventure who found out how high a price can be paid for forgetting what it can often take to survive such an adventure. The film bears a significant similarity to ALIVE, the 1993 film in which where the participants of that true-life ordeal (the 1972 Andean plane crash saga) were forced to survive their ordeal in one of the worst ways possible, in that case by resorting to cannibalism. Here, of course, Ralston, totally alone, cut off from the outside world in an isolated chasm where few people would have ever dared to go by themselves, had no other choice but to do what he did, which meant losing the lower half of his right arm in the process.Although it is understandable that the scene in question would leave a lot of people extremely queasy, this is every bit as unavoidable an aspect of the story as was the cannibalism in ALIVE, even though it takes up three to five minutes near the film's climax. Boyle can sometimes be accused of going too far with the viscera in his other films; and the scene is still quite shocking, even when compared to the opening twenty minutes of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. Still, thanks in large part to the way Franco portrays the change in Ralston's behavior from happy-go-lucky adventurer to a survivor almost reduced to nothing, 127 HOURS is a compelling film, especially given the fact that Boyle decided to film it in the very locations in Utah where Franco's saga took place. Besides being a compelling, if somewhat uneasy, film, it shows us how precious life is, and not to take it for granted, as the real-life Aron Ralston did with nearly fatal results.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Courage in the canyon,"Yes, you do spend the whole movie steeling yourself for the scene you know is coming and, yes, it is a visceral scene many people will shield their faces from. But the strength of 127 HOURS is more than just the sum of its severed parts: director Danny Boyle makes you share the appalling isolation in Aron's predicament, and James Franco's performance, slowly cracking up as the hours and days crawl by, makes you yearn for the crisis to have a different resolution.Boyle fills the painful hours with flashbacks to Aron's family life (and girlfriend moments) and fantasy forward flashes to the life he doesn't expect to see again. There are a few scenes which have almost certainly been added to spice up the waiting time(e.g. the water-baby games with two girl hikers and the near-Biblical flood) and Aron's videocam episodes verge on the mawkish (justifiably perhaps), but even without them this thrilling and beautifully photographed movie would pack a powerful punch.Faced with a lose-lose situation like Aron's, how many of us would have the courage to do what he did?",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Danny Boyle and James Franco both deserve Oscar's for this.,"Danny Boyle can do no wrong at the moment. He is rapidly becoming one of the world best directors and in the film ""127 hours"" this only enforces that point of view. It's true that you don't appreciate what you have until you are in a position to lose it and the story of Aron Ralston typifies this . James Franco is magnificent in this virtual one man show. Stuck , with his arm wedged by a rock ,miles from anywhere and having not told his family where he was , he is faced with a terrible decision. Does he die or does he cut his arm off to escape? What i love about this film is the way Danny Boyle manages to get Ralston's thoughts during his delusional moments across to the audience. There is one scene where he sees himself picking up the son he has not had yet and it's very moving. Inevitably , all the talk will be of the scene where he cuts his arm off and while it is horrific it's only a small part of what is a brilliant movie. If James Franco and Danny Boyle do not get nominated for an Oscar for this film it will be a major injustice because this movie is so much better than films like Social Network and Inception. A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pleasant,"My friends and i were planning on watching a movie on a weekend and we decided to go for 127 hours. We had no idea what the movie was about, who made it, the actors and other stuff. None of spoke during the movie because it was that good. We didn't even go to buy snacks during the intermission to avoid missing the movie, every minute of it was worth it.I won't go into the details and if you're planning to watch this movie neither should you, don't even read the synopsis. Just go and watch it and you'll be pleasantly surprised. For me one of the most amazing movies of 2010. If you are an adventurer definitely watch it, if you're not an adventurer, you would definitely want to be one after watching this movie. Even after being an amazing movie, most people who have watched this movie would agree that it's a one time watch, but even that one time is enough to appreciate all that the movie is about(*avoiding spoilers*).",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A kind of Eat, Pray, Love for men","'We were going to make an action movie in which the hero can't move', said director Danny Boyle of his latest movie 127 Hours, treating its completion as something of a challenge. Boyle needn't have worried; heading a team drawn from his earlier productions, he delivers a punchy, convincing and watchable piece of work. (Rodrigo Cortés got there last year with Buried, a taphephobic thriller trapping Ryan Reynolds in an underground box. And film purists will say Hitchcock did it with Rear Window.) Fortunately, cinematography and sound design help to create enough variety around likable protagonist James Franco for the movie not to seem like being trapped in a canyon for 127 hours.Adapted from Between a Rock and a Hard Place – a memoir by Aron Ralston – the film concerns the five-day period when, following a freak accident, a young climber's right hand was pinned by a falling boulder. Since no one knew of Ralston's whereabouts, starvation and dehydration loomed even though the pain of the injury had subsided. In print, Ralston's involuntarily immobility is an opportunity to reflect on his past life and mistakes; the movie uses condensed flashbacks, which mean Ralston's personal reflections seldom displace the more practical issue of survival. Despite these differences, book and film alike act as unwitting barometers of certain changes in society's values.The opening images reveal huge crowds on the move, combining what could be footage left over from Slumdog Millionaire with a basketball game at Utah Jazz's EnergySolutions Arena. Quite deliberately, this creates a contrast between the heaving multitudes of modern life and the solitary virtues of the wilderness. By showing rather than telling, Boyle lets us work this out by ourselves – which comes as a relief, compared to equivalent passages in Ralston's autobiography. In both film and book, the central narrative – trapped man has to go to extremes to escape – grabs the imagination.Ralston's memoir shows him embracing the outdoor life and abandoning a conventional career. Trained as an engineer, he focuses on the weekend – athletically hiking and attacking canyons and mountains with vigour – until the weekend's activities take priority completely. Eventually Ralston downsizes to working in a climbing gear shop and as a rescue volunteer because that is what he wants to do: 'because it's there' is the rationale for his outdoor activities. 'Climbing fourteeners in the winter by myself wasn't just something I did; it became who I was', he writes.Ralston writes of human estrangement from nature, all the while revealing his estrangement from other humans. For Boyle, there's no need to spell this out as ploddingly as the book does; instead it is implied, by cutting back and forth between beautiful landscapes and Ralston's claustrophobic surroundings, or between a crowded screen and the isolated figure cut by Franco throughout his restrained performance.The protagonist's estrangement from friends and relatives ends up played out into a half-hallucinated domestic world in which the dying Ralston makes (and videotapes) his apologies. Boyle has been accused of misanthropy before, as in his pseudo-zombie fest 28 Days Later, but here the disdain for humans seems to be more Ralston's message, whose ordeal could be seen as a realistic personal apocalypse.It is no spoiler to say that Ralston escaped by cutting off his right forearm. Indeed, among various commentators the shorthand – no pun intended – is to call this 'the amputation scene'. 'If you don't mind, I'm going before the arm', one squeamish critic told the receptionist at the press screening I attended. Those who stuck around witnessed a realistic looking scene where mobility is regained by hacking through flesh with a blunt multi-tool – one of those steel knocks-off of the Leatherman multiknife, handed out as freebies at petrol stations. Not only are they useless for chipping away at boulders, but, as audiences will see, they are also completely unsuitable as surgical instruments. Given the annual popularity of the Saw franchise, it is not impossible that this gruesome 'money shot' will be one of the things bringing people into the multiplexes and scooping up the pirate DVD in pubs, especially since improvements in prosthetics and digital effects are such that surgical scenes have acquired greater verisimilitude in the past decade.More seriously, the film has the universal appeal of making one ask 'what would I do in that situation? How far would I be prepared to go?' For this generation, more distant from the horrors of warfare and taught that the body is a temple, the loss of a hand is about the worst thing that could happen, unless bigger body parts were to be amputated and left under a rock. All this should perhaps prompt some reflection on how body horror got so mainstream.127 Hours ends – more or less – in a rescue, showing starkly some of the benefits of modern life. A black helicopter gets Ralston out of the wilderness and into hospital, not a snow-white ptarmigan. Accidents aside, Ralston's commitment to nature (and its capture on film by Boyle and team) is possible precisely because of us living in a developed society, with other people chipping in their skills towards his care and rehabilitation and, more recently, to back up his continuing career as a mountaineer.If filmed ordeals, body horror and wilderness worship all combine to make this inspiring tale of survival into a message of the moment, so too does the rise and rise of Ralston himself. 'My accident and rescue from Blue John Canyon were the most beautifully spiritual experiences of my life', his book concludes – a kind of Eat, Pray, Love for men. That Ralston stepped out of hospital and on to a treadmill of talkshows and the high-priced motivational speaking circuit makes him quite a typical accidental celebrity for our times.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Extremely boring,"Well i used to visit IMDb to see reviews and rates before i watch a film. I looked at the rating 8.5 and i thought..hey what the hell..the worse case scenario is for the movie to be average. The movie from the beginning until 15 minutes before it ends is extremely boring. Nothing really happens and when i say nothing i mean it. If someone decides to skip the part from 0:20 until 1:15 he will not miss a thing. The ending is just horrible. But i gave it a 3 and not 1 or 2 because surely i have watched a lot worse movies. When i watch a movie i expect from it to have tension, some action or at least to make me actually care about the main character. From the beginning i don't really care what will happen to the main character because if he likes danger he should be able to suck up the consequences as well.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
A movie for the ages.,"Danny Boyle wowed me with Trainspotting and floored me with Slumdog Millionaire. I had high expectations going into 127 Hours. Well simply put, Boyle has exceeded every expectation I had. 127 Hours is by no means a movie for everyone. There is very little dialogue, it kind of reminded me of Cast Away with Tom Hanks. Different circumstances but the need to do anything(and I mean anything!) to survive is present in both films. If you like only movies with explosions or crude jokes this might not be for you. If you want to challenge yourself for 95 minutes then I highly recommend you watch 127 Hours.James Franco is nothing short of brilliant in this role that I hope lands him the Oscar. He truly put his heart and soul into this role. He is an actor on the rise and this role proves it. I really though he was great in Pineapple Express but this role puts him at the top of today's current actors.And of course with any Danny Boyle movie there is the music. I won't give anything away but the final scene in this movie along with the music brought tears in my eyes. It is truly inspirational and something I likely will never forget. In my opinion it ranks as one of greatest 5 minutes to ever end a movie. This movie serves as a metaphor to the challenges we face in life. Stuck, feeling unable to move, we must remember that if we believe and persevere we can accomplish anything life throws at us. I remember coming out the theater, the cold winter air hitting my face and never feeling so alive after a movie ended.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great!,"First of all, it was so psychological film for me. It is related to Aron Ralston who is the mountaineer. And also related to his adventures. I learned that it was a real story. Thats why i chosen this film. Because i am really interested in real stories. The events start with pushed his arm under the rock. This event is lived near of the Utah. While his arm was under the rock, he faced to many difficulty. At the end he found the so amazing way. But while he was doing he should be so restrained. But the scene which saved his arm is a bit miserable. Because there are many blood there. By the way, i liked the landscape of the nature. This scenes enriched the film of 127 hours. For me, there are two main idea in this film. First one is inevitability. Because first time he could not find way out. It is the indicate of inevitability. The other main idea is determination. He was determined person. If someone be determined he will success many thing. Generally, Danny Boyle who the director of film is do a good job. In one scene, there many event.

A thrilling and real story about a man against himself,"When you go to see Danny Boyle's ""127 Hours"" you simply have two choices just like the main character trapped in the canyon: or you watch it or leave it behind without seeing a thing. But if you want to see be aware of everything that comes on the story of Aron Ralston and don't expect to find a howling message than the ones given by the main character in some scenes. It's indeed a real story but it doesn't fills us with morals, messages or anything similar which is very common in real life stories. Perhaps the biggest lessons you can learn with ""127 Hours"" is always bring a cellphone wherever you'll go, and always, always, tell to everyone you know where are you going, just in the case you get lost in the middle of the desert, with your arm trapped in a canyon, without water to drink and other disasters.This is a movie about what happened to Aron (played by James Franco) and all his ways of survival during those five days with his arm stuck in a canyon in the desert without a phone, not able to call for any help and with his water stock running out, and with only had two choices while being there: death a slowly death or cut off his arm with a knife. Second option is the chosen one and is the most awaited moment in the film. The amputation scene (filmed in one take) is frightening with some good sound effects mixed with the background music.Everything is thrilling here, from the minute where Aron's adventure begins up until his tough and difficult moments in the canyon, thinking about his family and some imaginary moments of a future life outside of the canyon, and his moments after getting out of there. This is a one man show and Franco carries the whole film in a heartbreaking performance. A movie depending on his main star is very difficult to be made and to audiences like (being Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away"" a rare successful example) but Boyle surely found his actor here. Franco is excellent in the whole drama, he's very believable in the risky scenes climbing the canyons, you really can believe that he's a adventurer (although a little bit silly).But if the dramatic scenes, and his breakdown moments are great and conduces the film, it is a funny and surprising moment that really caught my attention, and that is the ""Good Morning"" scene, a hilarious and positive moment where Aron makes fun of himself while in the canyon, creating a TV show where he interviews himself telling his whole situation there. Just a reminder of how positive someone could be even in a dramatic and tense situation, not everyone can do that, and he managed to lighten up the tension of a story that at no point makes us feel distracted, calm, or uninterested. It holds the viewers in the chair at every second, every minute in its short running time.""127 Hours"" doesn't want to deliver a message, or be preachy about anything, it's not philosophical. It is simply a real life event that urges the viewers to see the man's struggle in a shocking event where he only has two choices and both of them are not that good and he's the only one who can do something about it. There's a few lessons to be learned here even for those who are not inclined to enter in an adventure in the middle of the desert.Danny Boyle makes of ""127 Hours"" a triumph in technical qualities, great editing, great music, great sound effects, brilliant cinematography and a powerful performance by James Franco. The final result is a great film about a man against himself in his most difficult and most painful moment of his life. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One More Take: 127 Hours,"127 Hours chronicles the true story of Aron Ralston, who got his arm crushed by a rock whilst galivanting around in Utah. The title, rather obviously, refers to just how damn long he survived in the situation before, spoilers, cutting off his arm and hobbling to salvation.I like the director, Danny Boyle, quite a bit. Trainspotting is a weird masterpiece of unhinged dark comedy and horrifying humanity, and 28 Days Later is one of the best zombie films ever made, opting for a pure dreadful realism not often inhabited by the genre. This is to name but two in an eclectic career, but shows his capacity for doing vastly different films very well. 127 Hours, unfortunately, doesn't rise to the heights of these, or Slumdog Millionaire. And yet, it feels like it almost could have, given some different stylistic choices.There are two ways, in my mind, to approach a story like this. Let's look at both.1. Keep a tense and narrow focus, both emotionally and visually, on the stark reality of the situation. This would be the more difficult of the two (you'll see why in a moment), mostly due to visual limitations. A filmmaker must be very inventive and creative to have a single-location movie keep up its visual dynamism. A perfect exemplar for this is 12 Angry Men, the masterpiece courtroom drama, wherein Sidney Lumet gradually shifts the framing to make things feel more and more claustrophobic. In a different way, Tarantino's The Hateful Eight similarly functions as almost a stage play, within the confines of a single cabin, but never lacks for dynamic interaction. In terms of spacing, these are relatively tight pieces, but they have the advantage of being about multiple people, and people who can move. When it's just James Franco stuck under a rock for an hour, the task probably seems much more difficult, and likely why Boyle elected the latter:2. Shift your focus. There are a few ways to do this. Thankfully, Boyle didn't go in what would be the obvious direction for a less inventive filmmaker, in cutting away to some parallel story where the protagonist's family, or girlfriend, or (insert character) goes out of their mind with worry. Instead, the film shifts focus by indulging in a form of psychological interiority, where Ralston's life reflections and dehydrated fever dreams come to life in imagination sequences which serve to break up what Boyle probably feared would be the perceived visual monotony of, like we said, James Franco stuck under a rock.Trouble is, these focus shifts had the opposite effect for me, and led what could and should have been an intense claustrophobic scenario into a backslide into indie quirk, which does a tonal disservice to the situation. Yes, it added variety, as Franco dreams of his girlfriend and family and past and so forth, but none of these elements really inform the character in a way that couldn't have been achieved, without losing focus and tone, by him simply speaking these things into his camera, which he does at various other points. This feels strange to say, since ""show over tell"" is generally my soapbox for exposition, but this really isn't exposition. It's not about plot. It's about a man coming to terms with his life and fears and failings, and when you have Franco doing some of the best acting of his life (he's the best part of the movie), keeping the focus right on him would have been, in all ways, better. In addition, we don't really learn anything we don't already infer about the character from these cut-aways. He's a loner, he wishes he wasn't, etc. There's no point in me going too deep into all of that, except to reiterate that starkly focalizing the character and the dire situation would have engendered far more gravity than these quirky imagination scenes. 12 Angry Men works because the camera never leaves that room. 127 Hours should have done the same, and Boyle should have trusted himself, and his audience, enough to persevere in that. The tendency towards quirky interlude may inject visual variety, but it deflates the rawness. We really didn't need the pillow. Let us inhabit the reality of the situation, along with the character, and we'll feel it all the more.FINAL TAKE: Despite this pretty major criticism, 127 Hours is still worth watching. James Franco is much more at home in these small movies than he is in big pictures (one need only look at his flavorless, narcoleptic performances in Oz the Great and Powerful or Rise of the Planet of the Apes for proof), and he is really, really good here, and when the film does keep its focus, it's a winner. The procedural, survival-oriented stuff is great, particularly in the agonizing, pull-no-punches finale. These elements, which comprise the lion's share, earn a recommendation. It's just too bad it didn't stick to its guns. Given the 28 Days Later treatment of brutal, don't-look-away reality, it might have been something really special.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Who is Aron Ralston?,"127 Hours is the incredible true story of a naive outdoors man/engineer who embarks on a journey into a remote canyon without telling anyone his whereabouts for the weekend. He gets into a terrible accident, leaving his right hand stuck under a boulder and no way out for, as the title implies, 127 hours. As he fights for survival, having to resort to very desperate measures, the viewer catches glimpses of his life - moments that he is fond of and moments that he regrets.I was unaware that this film was nominated for several Oscars upon my initial viewing, but I'm not too surprised. The cinematography is brilliant which contributes to the way the filming was executed. More than half of the film is spent with Aron Ralston (James Franco) as he struggles to survive in the canyon - yet we never get bored of being there with him in the one scene. The storyline is also unique and the message is inspiring.However, I did not give this film 10/10. That is simply because although we the audience got to know our protagonist as he struggled to come to grips with his predicament and realize his own flaws in life, I felt that the film was lacking in exploring his character before the accident. The first twenty minutes of the film before the accident occurs was, in my opinion, awkward and rushed. I didn't feel any genuine connection with the character and it seemed like the accident was just waiting to happen to get the film going. I would've preferred to learn more about him as a person just from the movie, although I haven't read the book to be fair so this is simply how it was written.Great film overall.. but in terms of character development I felt like it could have started off with more and expanded further.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Harrowing film. Great visuals a great reflection of life when stuck between a rock and a hard place.,"Finally saw ""127 Hours"" and I must say terrific film a tribute to the human soul and right to life. After watching this film you will never again take anything in life for granted even the small stuff like food, water, and everything else from sharing time with people will be that much more important to you. This film is also a film of reflection to make one think about mistakes, choices, and it gives one the will and determination to live.Director Danny Boyle who's always at the top of his game always makes pictures that are tough yet usually the human soul and spirit prevails(""Slumdog Millionaire"")this picture even though harrowing and a struggle wins in the end. As it's isolated journey helps you as a viewer appreciate in the end everything about life. Many of the visuals(aside from the bloody arm amputation scene)are wonderfully done as the camera work of angles of the canyons are top notch. And themes of drama, emotion, uncertainty, loss and will to survive make it such a compelling film.Based on a real life true story of hiker and rock climber Aron Ralston(in a career best performance from Jack of all trades James Franco)it's 2003 and Aron an adventure and loner type decides to take a weekend trip to Moab, Utah for some climbing and sight seeing of some beautiful and wonderful canyons. Upon arrival he meets two cute gals Kristi(Kate Mara)and Megan(Amber Tamblyn)and after having a little fun and taking a dip in a nearby lake stream of water, it's back to more canyon climbing for Aron. Only a big fall of uncertainty and isolation takes place with a slip all of a sudden Ralston takes a fall between a narrow canyon and to complicate matters a giant boulder has fallen trapping and pinning him in.From then on the film becomes a journey of self discovery as the flashbacks and scenes of foreshadowing tell Aron a lot about life he thinks about his past and to help keep him alive and for motivation good thoughts and images of family, friends, and intimate thoughts of Kristi and Megan help keep him going another day. As being trapped for five days Aron learns to appreciate much even the small things like air and water. And perhaps god sent are the premonitions of things to come as that only gives him more motivation to live. As being stuck between a rock and a hard place and the fact that no one knows calls for desperate measures in desperate times. The scene is gross and somewhat disturbing it shows just what someone will do just so they can survive.""127 Hours"" is a film that proves never take anything for granted as in an unexpected and unplanned time of survival isolation one can learn to appreciate everything even the small things like water and air. Things happen for a reason as maybe this was for Aron to look at his life this film is a great one of reflection and having the will to live it's certainly one picture to be respected as you will feel touched and moved it's a human triumph of the soul and spirit.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
So So But Unrewarding Film,"So the film is the famous story of Aron Ralston, an American climber who goes on a canyon hike in Utah and comes acropper when his arm gets trapped by an 800lb boulder. After 6 days he realises he is going to have to take drastic action to ensure his escape.I felt this film was a bit of a mixed bag. Certainly the story felt very unnerving and haunted me long after the film had finished, this was due to the film capturing very well the isolation of the place Aron was trapped in. I also think the film did a very good job of highlighting what an idiot Aron was for getting into that predicament and how selfish he must have been around the time. It did this without making us dislike him too much, so I think it made a good balance out of his character. But I wasn't actively rooting for him as such, 1 - because I knew what happens anyway, and 2 - because whilst I'd not wish that on anyone, it's hard to root for him as it all transpires through his own foolishness, and there's a near infinite list of people who have met an untimely demise through no fault of their own. So we might perhaps consider them more 'deserving' of our sympathies.James Franco did a rather workmanlike job as Aron, showing he kept his head well in spite of what happened, and rallied himself for an escape on day 6 despite his weak and delusional state. But I felt disconnected from his character, in fairness this could be the direction, as Boyle is somewhat patchy IMO.The camera-work was excellent regarding the scenery and it really did ram home how desolate that place is and how insignificant a speck of nothingness is a human being, I thought that aspect of the film was superb. The editing however, good god...It was like MTV gone mad! I realise it's incredibly hard to make an engaging 90 min film with only one character, but the constant hallucinations and flashbacks with split-screen effect, well that was such a cheap way out of it and smacked of very immature film-making. A better director could have made that film work without any of the cheap gimmicks, because the story is highly unsettling and the stuff from which edge of your seat tension could be made, in the right hands.There is no message to the film, despite what anyone will tell you. It merely shows us that people are capable of tremendous deeds when their life is on the line - this is already well documented, and that human hubris can get you into trouble, again this is very well documented and I am sure many of us know this from our own experience.So, whilst I enjoyed certain aspects of the film, it was somewhat unfulfilling - certainly it's no 'Alive' or 'Touching the Void' - but I think this was down to the directing and nasty editing for the MTV generation.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"127 Hours"" is about resilience and willpower. It's also a one-man movie. Its dynamism is contagious, and the protagonist's energy illuminates the screen","127 Hours is based on the homonymous book of the same name, in turn narrated by the experience lived by its author Aron Ralston (James Franco), an engineer involved in mountaineering, who goes out to explore Blue John Canyon without telling anyone nearby and ends up in an accident., trapping his forearm in a rock, forcing him to survive for a little more than five days in the crevice of a canyon, until he decided to cut his own limb to escape.Due to the premise and being a film by energetic filmmaker Danny Boyle, we already have a compelling fact about the narrative: She will look for more to tell. Not that the exercise in survival described by the real story was not enough material to make a ninety-minute feature film, but knowing a little about the director's style, it is evident that his anxious lens would not be satisfied only with the contemplation of the suffering of the incident, even so he observes it in a secondary way. The film, in fact, is about the transformation of a man who came very close to death, in a reading indeed, not as private as it could be, contrary to what the source material indicates.The text adapted by Danny Boyle in partnership with Simon Beaufoy, seeks to escape biographical didactics, always looking for other visual resources to offer particularities of the character's personality, to assemble his psychological puzzle and have an insight into what will change, from before to after. Of tragedy. Flashbacks with time lapses illustrating what he might have regretted, video-vlogs for the character to dialogue with the audience about what he is feeling even with subjective outbursts, playful sequences of what he would be doing if he were not there, montages with parallelisms between different times in the rock and out of it. Boyle is constantly interspersing these different perspectives, forcing a stylization aimed at reaching a greater depth in Aron's psyche.The script is dynamic and very fluid. He doesn't fool around when he plays what the viewer wants to see: Aron is stuck in the rock with sixteen minutes of film and, for an hour, the audience knows a little more about his history. The most interesting aspect is the deconstruction of Aron during the hours he is trapped. At the beginning of the film, he is presented as a symbol of independence, confidence, arrogance, free will and freedom or, as he himself quips, ""big hard hero"". But after the accident, he begins to realize, little by little, that, in fact, there is no one who really owns his own destiny - this becomes very explicit during his reflection on the rock. He also begins to lose confidence and faith in himself. And this can be noticed in that every time he tries to accomplish something, he always says several ""pleases"". Other than that, the choice of the testimonial video to maintain the dialogues and pacing of the film was very smart.In the text the idea is great, but in practice, even with a James Franco duly inspired by expressiveness that reactivates natural difficulties and committed to giving sentimental layers to the character according to the amount of time he spends there, the director's stylization works more like a objective works more as an object of rhythmic dynamics to the film, so that it does not fall into the doldrums, than an existentialist deepening of the ""valuing life"" that surrounds the final message. Because the motivations presented, in the end, are not so much more than the basics of the information raised at the beginning. Even from the approach adopted, we don't know the real origins of Aron's relationship difficulties with his parents or old flame, beyond the consequences to his compulsory lifestyle, the great turning point in the micro character study.At this point, Boyle's hyperbolic drive ends up fitting like a glove. If the film could very well be confused with a mix of ""Cast Away"" and ""Buried Alive"", it is the filmmaker's fast-paced drive that gives rhythm and fluidity to a plot essentially limited in terms of space and time. Still, Boyle tries not to overshadow Franco's show, who cries, smiles, screams and even talks to himself, presenting a series of emotions without ever failing to convince the audience that he is really going through that extreme situation.There is one thing a little clear in the film's story. Once trapped in the rock, Aron proves to be a very well-equipped mountaineer with flashlights, watches, infinite meters of rope, credit cards, etc. Hands, a cell phone. This proves the recklessness of the protagonist who travels alone to the canyon - many mountaineers travel in groups to avoid accidents and usually carry flare guns. Despite these slips, there are many interesting things like Aron's daydreams and hallucinations, the irony that is sometimes present and the criticism of society's not-so-new habit: digitally documenting all the lived moments and, of course, the exciting climax of taking the breath or even the conscience of some.Cinematographers Enrique Chediak and Aenhony Dod Mantle delivered a well-polished and visually clean work. In the first act of the film, all the images are very open and clear, with the orange tone of the rocks predominating, with a strong contrast with the blue of the sky. Also, many shots are diagonal creating an identity for the film. She transforms from the second act, taking on a cold, pale and dark hue with very close and shaky close-ups of Franco's face. It's not quite claustrophobic, thanks to the escapades for flashbacks, but it's certainly uncomfortable. They can also create extraordinary lighting effects - the best example I can cite is the sunlight invading the canyon crevice during the fifteen minutes of daily light that Aron receives. To complement, most of the scenes where Aron is trapped were filmed in the studio, that is, the lighting is entirely artificial.With the help of visual effects, they manage to capture sublime images such as the interesting transformation from arid to rainy weather in a matter of seconds. In fact, several shots are created entirely by the effects, such as the inside of the backpack's hydration tube, the inside of the camcorder and the inside of Aron's arm. Other areas worthy of mention are the sublime, complex and detailed makeup presented in the climax and the art direction that perfectly recreates the space that Aron was confined to during his agonizing imprisonment.The editing of 127 Hours is very dynamic, with a faster pace, counting on the union of several shots on the screen, usually separated by vertical lines, which is already characteristic of the director, helps in this dynamism. The movie does have some stronger scenes, but nothing exaggerated. In fact, we rarely see the main character showing pain. But it is worth mentioning the performance of James Franco, which was very engaging and charismatic. The 127 Hours soundtrack also helps a lot in creating a lighter ambiance, despite the desperate situation. It is curious to note how in the film, and in Aron's own story, the recording of moments and places, both through photo and video, plays a very important role. How are people going to believe such an incredible story these days if there is no record that can be shared?Based on a true story, ""127 Hours"" is about resilience and willpower. It's also a one-man movie. But all those supposed clichés are left behind when Aron Ralston (Franco) cuts off his own arm and gives himself one more chance to live. Franco gets the message and lets all his dramatic potential shine through on screen. Boyle fits a cliché here, a corny option there, but he ends the film with goosebumps. Although the camera here is accelerated, what really counts is the emotion.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Milestone!,"'127 Hours' is A Milestone Motion Picture. An Incredible True Story into a Film. Academy-Award Winner filmmaker Danny Boyle is at his best in here, he executes this story with magic. Easily amongst his finest works to date.'127 Hours' is based on real-life mountain climber Aron Ralston, who became trapped by a boulder in Robbers Roost, Utah, for more than five days in early 2003 before amputating his arm.A courageous, violent & winning true story is made into one heck of a cinematic watch. Boyle understands the story and executes each sequence like a seasoned player. Cinematography & Editing are awesome. Music by Academy-Award Winner A.R Rahman is legendary.James Franco is a marvel. A performance that isolates you and makes you question yourself.

Not a bad film but what's the point,"Made around the same time as buried, and clearly a peer in the world of mis en scene but what does this film really bring to the table. My rating is harsh because I can't believe how highly it's been rated, I'm a Danny Boyle fan but as a director he's not really breaking new ground here.What is the message? Simply the force of human spirit to survive, who cares we've seen it a million times before, someone prevailing against overwhelming odds. I actually felt compelled to write this review simply because I feel like the whole film is just a document of something horrible that happened to someone and yet what did that person, or us as viewers, learn, leave a note when you're going hiking...How can people be so amazed by such a simple concept, it's not a bad film and it did to a certain extent bring that experience to life but what's the point really?

A beautifully told story,"Danny Boyle has always been a favorite of mine with his record of consistently making amazing films across the genres. Once again, he has kept up the flawless work with his latest film, 127 Hours (2010). James Franco gives an absolutely outstanding performance in this true story about a mountain climber, Aron Ralston, who becomes trapped inside a canyon when a boulder falls onto his arm. From here, we stick with Aron as he tackles the struggle of survival for the next 127 hours (We can thank elliptical editing for only having to sit through 94 minutes of this brutal attack by nature). To say it is a story of survival would be an understatement. It's a story of what it means to live—why we do the things we do, what's important, what isn't. It's about human will power, but Aron Ralston did not just suffer 127 hours of physical pain. This film takes us on an existential journey in discovering what his life truly meant to him. Despite the pain and suffering Aron must manage, we get to admire the beautiful cinematography. It's pretty safe to say that in the wrong hands, this film could have been a major let down—a lifetime movie, perhaps? Luckily, the visual imagery by cinematographers Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle will capture your attention and hold it for the length of the film. Their collaboration successfully captures the landscape's harsh beauty. The visual style most definitely supports the story telling. Aron may be pinned into immobile suffering, but the camera sure isn't. The constant movement works omnisciently, allowing us to understand every aspect of Aron's entrapment within the canyon and his conscience. Take my advice, go catch this flick, but bring your barf bag if you have a weak stomach!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An intense and emotional experience; draining yet very uplifting,"Once again Danny Boyle has created a cinematic treasure. Much like Slumdog Millionaire, Trainspotting and 28 Days Later; 127 Hours is such a fantastic experience, despite the incredibly heavy subject matter. From the beginning to the end 127 Hours had me glued to the screen, leaving me speechless and incredibly emotional. What made this even more powerful was the ever-present theme of the importance of human contact, which was never made to be sentimental, but which was a gentle reminder of the significance of family, friends and partners.Boyle took on a big challenge when he chose to make a film based mostly in a canyon with a man whose arm is trapped under a rock. It was never an easy task, as it is an action movie with no action in the typical sense. However, Boyle uses his creativity, which can be found in many of his previous films, to keep his audience captivated and thoroughly engaged in the proceedings. Showing us views from all different angles (even from inside water bottles and tubings) in order to enhance the horrible situation and make it seem more ""in your face."" For instance, we see inside the tubing of the water backpack a couple of times, which may seem pointless, but when we see it as he is drinking his urine from it it becomes much more visceral and gut-wrenching. During the many flashbacks and hallucinations that Aron Ralston (James Franco) experiences Boyle utilises his hyper-kinetic editing style to show his delusional state of mind, although sometimes it can be slightly overdone.Another reason this movie is so good is a result of James Franco's outstanding performance. A whole range of emotions are re-enacted with such realism and grittiness it is hard not to be blown away. He is just a tour-de-force...his pain seems real, his psychological breakdown scary and his dark humour uncomfortably funny. Franco is rightly being recognised for his job, and if he gets the Oscar I will not be surprised or disappointed.A.R. Rahman once again collaborates with Boyle to produce a stunning soundtrack never seems out of place, perfectly accompanying the dramatic scenes and the horrific amputation scene. Yes, the scene is shocking, brutal, and graphic, but is not the reason to see this movie. It is the events leading up to it, and the reasons behind it which truly make this movie worth seeing. Boyle has managed to turn a tale of survival, courage and hope into a very un-American, uncliched story. It is not an epic tale with a thrilling climax, it is an honest story of one man's will to live once he realises what he has to live for. It may not be totally uplifting, but its message is nonetheless important.127 Hours is not for everyone, but I would recommend it to anyone and everyone I could. It is hard to watch at times, but it is so well made on all fronts (be it directing, writing, acting, or scoring) that it is easily one of the best films of 2010.4½/5",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
127 Hours is one of the most exhausting and exhilarating movies of the year. A must-see for those who can handle it.,"Rarely am I compelled to review a movie immediately after seeing it on film. More often than not, it leads to me drawling a far too subjective conclusion on something too fresh to have fully settled in. With 127 Hours, I have decided to make an exception because I think the way I feel about the film immediately after viewing it adds an element to the review that can't be conveyed in words. What's the element- complete and utter exhilaration and total mental exhaustion.I've been involved in two big accidents since the day I started driving. Both resulted in two totaled cars (mine and the others), a serious hike in insurance, and a healthy reminder to continually wear a seat belt no matter how far I'm going. I remember vividly the moment directly after each accident. I gathered myself, looked around, felt my legs to make sure they were working, and then said to myself, ""there's no way that just happened."" In 127 Hours, Aron Ralston is put in a similar situation, except instead of getting in an accident, he falls down a cliff and instead of feeling around and realizing his legs are still working, he looks down to see his arm smashed and pinned directly under a huge rock. Regardless of the change in scenarios, both stories end with the same quote, ""there's no way that just happened.""127 Hours is based on the true story of Aron Ralston, a rebel, a rock climber, and a fully independent adult ready to take on the cliffs in Moab, Utah for a routine weekend excursion. He packs his things, hits the trails, and embarks on a beautiful journey by bike, but he makes one serious mistake- he tells no one where he's going before he leaves. Much of this is indicative of Aron's lifestyle which could be considered fly solo and by the seat of your pants. In his defense however, the story that's about to unfold is one of almost impossible calculations. He couldn't have seen it coming, but maybe it was just written in the stars.90% of the film takes place one on one with Aron, played by James Franco, as he's trapped inside the canyon walls. There's no special effects or camera trickery, just Franco, a camera, a slew of supplies which he happened to have on him during the accident, and of course us, the audience, watching every move the actor makes on screen. For Franco, this is an extremely personal film. We're on him for an hour and a half, close ups of his face, his eyes, his arm, his body, watching and writhing as he tries everything he can to survive. He plays the part extremely well, with every emotion striking through the rocks like a sharp nail. There's no way he will be denied a nomination for this performance at this year's Academy Awards.When I started reviewing this film, I wanted to open with the line, ""There's only one way to describe 127 Hours, and that word is awesome."" Then I got to thinking. There isn't just one way to describe this film, there's tons, and trust me, every way you turn it, the outcome is positive. This film is awesome, exhilarating, breathtaking, brutal, exhausting, and at times, almost impossible to watch. There's literally no way not to respond to this film, as there is no one in this world who could not sympathize for someone literally stuck under a rock, fully aware of their untimely predicament and the fact that they literally have no chance of getting saved or better yet, unstuck. It's like being fully aware in a vegetative state, but worse, because you can actually move, you're in 44 degree weather, and you're drinking your own urine to survive. It makes my stomach cringe just thinking about it.As other critics have already eluded to and anyone at least somewhat familiar with the film's story line already knows about, the final scenes in the film are almost impossible to watch without either A. fainting, B. leaving the theater, or C. having to turn your head. My father and I both opted for the turn of the head, but I saw multiple individuals (specifically females) who had to opt for option B for the lengthy 6 minute scene. It's shown in brutal detail, leaving nothing to the imagination, which in my opinion, wasn't totally necessary, but does add a sense of authenticity and accomplishment when it comes to what Aron has to do to get free.127 Hours is an amazing film. I've never felt so exhausted after leaving a theater. The very final moments of the film felt better than any film I've seen recently. I look up to Aron, not for being some sort of hero or even for being a genuinely good person, but for the fact that he went through the worst 5 days I could ever imagine, and survived.. It's one of the most amazing achievements I've ever heard a human make, and the way it was captured and brought to the screen can't receive any higher praise from me.127 Hours is a tough film to watch, but one that shouldn't be missed. It will be on my top 10 of the year, it's just a matter of what number.Michael Buffa Editor, Popcorn Jury http://www.popcornjury.com",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
127 Hours...... my favorite movie of 2010,"This Review May Contain Spoilers! ALert! ; )I Walked into the theater to see 127 hours and saw not too many people in the theater. Probably because it had been 3 or so weeks after it came out. And once the movie started, it was a bit weird for me (people going up escalator's , etc....), but then i started noticing the editing. I said to myself: ""Wow... This is mazing!"" The editing in this film was truly amazing. After Aaron runs into the 2 girls, it really shows you that he had a nice spirit and was very adventurous. After getting stuck between the rock, he starts to remember the past in his life.i thought that that was a nice way, in fact a really nice way to make the movie good. I thought, before walking into the theater: ""How will Danny Boyle make you entertained when its just that man stuck between a rock?"" Now Danny Boyle really finds a way in this film to make it to make it entertaining and not boring and and make the film stand out to be not just the guy cutting his arm off but, but finding ways to save himself, remembering he times when he was young and making sure that if he makes it out alive, that he always answers his parents' calls.This films is for me by far the best of the year and i think that it should win best picture ( even though i think that the king's speech or black swan will win) of the year and makes me think of James Franko as a much better actor and Danny Boyle a much better director. I recommend this film to anybody and i hope that you people enjoy this film as much as i do.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It makes you laugh, it makes you cry and it makes you want to see it over and over again!","It's my first movie review in IMDb, so please be kind :D Some months ago (probably November), I found this movie here on IMDb. I was really excited, because I'm a big fan of survival stories and I already knew this one because Bear Grylls mentioned it on ""Man Vs. Wild"", which is a show I watch a lot. Unfourtunetely, this movie's premiere here in Portugal was last week, that's about two months after the American premiere. That meant I would have to wait a long time to see this movie. I could have downloaded it, but I wanted to see this movie with good quality and subtitles so I waited. It was hard but, oh boy, it was all worth it!!!I loved how the movie started, it started quickly, with great music and editing. I couldn't ask for more!I just think the part when Aron falls into the crevasse should have more emphasis. It was because of that fall that the movie was made and that Aron did what he did.. I think they should have added some slow-motion. :)The scenes from the crevasse have a different meaning with James Franco. He is perfect for the role and he can make us live Aron's drama is such way that sometimes it looks we are also there. Brilliant! Anguish, sadness, happiness, joy... ""127 Hours"" and James Franco can make us laugh and cry and the same time; it's such a great movie!The infamous amputation scene was not painful to watch. I don't like horror movies, because all of the gory and bloody scenes, so I was a bit afraid of this scene. But I could watch the scene without closing my eyes or even covering or turning my face away. It's really no big deal, but fortunately for me, a girl got out of the cinema after that scene and that made me win a bet with my friends! :PI've already watched ""The King's Speech"", so I know what Colin Firth did in that movie. He was amazing and deserved the Academy Award for Best Actor, but if it wasn't for him, I think Franco should have won it. He's great.Overall, it was an amazing movie, although it was too short, but I guess that most people don't want to see a guy talking alone in a crevasse for 2 hours. I wouldn't mind! I was not hoping such a quiet movie, but I loved it. When it finished, I wanted to see it again and I probably will see it again next week with more friends.I really think everybody should see this movie. Don't avoid it, just because of the amputation scene. If you are fragile, close your eyes, you will know when it's over because of the music (by the way, the music from that scene is great).Probably my favorite movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Concerto for Left Hand,"Films such as 127 HOURS come along all too rarely. Based on a true story, the memoir by Aron Ralston 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place', and prepared for the screen by Simon Beaufoy and writer/director Danny Boyle, this film is a paean to the indomitable spirit of man. Basically a one man drama - Aron Ralston (James Franco) - the writers and director have managed to transfer enough outside of the story energy to keep the film in motion at all times.The story is well-known: Aron Ralston (Franco) set out for one of his freewheeling adventures in April 2003 in the canyons of Utah, befriends two girls (Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) in hiking distress, and proceeds on his hike only to fall into a crevice with a heavy rock crushing his right hand. The story is about the 127 hours Ralston endures and ultimately survives by excising his own partial right extremity, thus limiting all his efforts to the use of his left hand, freeing himself until he can return home to his parents (Kate Burton and Treat Williams) and his girlfriend (Clémence Poésy). The magic in the film is how immersed Franco is in this role, keeping our attention and compassion through his on-videocamera jokes and pathos. How he survives is a wonder of nature, of ingenuity, and faith, and that is what sets the film apart as being so special.Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A Masterpiece, Boyle has peaked.","Danny Boyle has really shown what he's capable of with the production of a film like 127 hours. At first I had my doubts about whether this film would be worth the hype and after reading the reviews I was intrigued about how it would actually work. These doubts however, were completely shrugged off after a gripping and entertaining watch of a film I can only describe as an emotional roller-coaster. I got so involved with this film. Boyle really does have a nack of moving his audience to connecting with characters and through out this film he does just that. Although James Franco's character appears to be a tough and edgey character, you begin to really feel for him and almost emphasise the pain he is going through. So when the sh** hits the fan and he is led no other option but to take his own arm, you understand his logic of survival and courage which distracts you from the utter gore of such an horrific scene. Boyle has made a landmark in his career with 127 hours supported by a stunning performance by James Franco. This story of survival is must see for all.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Is this a joke????,I bought this on DVD for around 12 dollars today and looked forward to seeing it. Imagine my surprise. This movie is just crap. A sort of parody on Touching the Void which is the real thing. There is really nothing in this movie. The actor looks like he is perfectly on top of the situation no matter what happens. At one point we just lose interest. It must have been horrible to be stuck in the cinema with this one. It is so boring. I recommend Touching the Void instead which is a really great movie and story and book about a great subject that is quite similar to this but far more interesting and realistic. To be quite honest I really lost interest in 127 hours and is now writing the review while the movie is playing in the background. I just realized that I really did not care what happened. There is just no suspense at all. It is a terrible movie. Not only is it bad it is also incredibly boring and a complete waste of time.,4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"127 Hours of excitement, adrenaline, regret, and awesome!","I LOVE this movie! OK, got that off my chest. Anyways, as I write this review, I'm listening to the song at the start of the movie, called ""Never Hear Surf Music Again"" by the Free Blood. Worth a listen, search it on you-tube. But anyway this was from beside the point of how much I love and recommend this movie to everyone living on planet Earth right now.I saw the movie with high expectations and was disappointed that it wasn't over 2 hours long, but the movie made up for that because the pacing was good and it felt right. The intro to the movie is going to be on my top ten movie intros of all time, reaching in at number 1. For now. The song worked so well and naturally every song and score in this movie worked perfectly, even if it felt out of place at times, which also felt in place! At the same time! Like I said, I am listening to the intro song as I write this. It's so addicting! 127 Hours is the story of Aron Ralston's life-changing experience in 2003 which was news nationwide. He even won person of the year awards. But the story goes that he goes on this canyoning trip somewhere in Utah and while there, he meets two girls that he spends some time showing them around the place because they're lost. After they mingle and leave, he's invited to a party setup by them and he accepts. So he continues to trek for the rest of the day around Utah's beautiful rocky caves.Unfortunately, one open gap leading down into a cave decides his fate for the next few, long, painful days. Aron decides to go on further between the narrow cave gap, and the rock he tested by stomping on it to see if it will fall, falls on him and sends him down the cave, making his arm stuck in the process. After he realizes he's screwed beyond belief he tries to make the best of it, tries to keep himself calm and tries not to think of the worst.Given that he's an engineer, he tries to salvage as much water as possible to survive for the next 127 hours. The only thing he regrets the most? Not leaving a note (which he does now in real life). At the start of the movie, you can hear a phone ringing, and when it goes to voice message, it's his mother saying hi. So, he regrets not picking up the phone because he could have told his mother where he was going, and that would have been his salvation ultimately.After realizing that mistake, the fun begins. He has visions of his past in his youth with his family and events that he thinks lead him to his unfortunate fate. But he tries not to go on the Karma route explanation because he doesn't believe in fate, neither do I. He believes that life is what you make of it, and so do I.So, he does what he can to survive in this entrapment he's in for the next few days. As days pass by, he keeps on hoping and dreaming that he'll free himself, but all his attempts fail. He even has hallucinations of the freedoms he once enjoyed before being in the position he was in. It's like the director actually wants you to believe that there's no hope. But there is. He has a solution which failed before, but not again. He wants to cut off his arm to break free from the trap he's in.Let me tell you, not a pretty scene to watch, but he cuts off his whole arm and breaks free from the grip. He eventually gets an emergency airlift and he is re-united with his family and friends once again. There is a brief cameo from the real Aron Ralston just after the end of the movie. This movie is what happened to the real Aron Ralston back in 2003 and that's why he won so many awards, because of the many obstacles he overcame at impossible odds that not many would sacrifice to get freedom the way he did.And I can't help but think how awesome would it be if Chris Mccandless still lived today; what he would say to Aron Ralston, or better yet, to put them in a room together interviewing each other, becoming great friends and take a canyon trip and record their journey. It would be like two titans coming together, a meeting of the minds. If you don't know who Chris is, then please read the book ""Into the Wild"" or watch the movie, or do both.Anyways, I now depart and hopefully you've enjoyed my thorough review of 127 hours. If you have not watched it, I insist you do watch it. Day 1 blu-ray buy for me, that's for sure!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"127 Hours is not a film for the faint hearted but if you want to watch good, liberating cinema at its best, then this one's class!!","Despite good movies like 'Trainspotting' and '28 Days Later', it was 'Slumdog Millionaire' that propelled Danny Boyle to the League of Extraordinary Directors. Now being an Indian, I had no qualms with Slumdog Millionaire; I thought it was a good movie which deserved most of its honours. But, then again, every second Bollywood movie consists of action, drama and loads of 'masala', so Slumdog was something I'm immune to.A.R.Rahman didn't need two Oscars and the Pussycat Dolls strutting to his number for him to be proved a success. I've seen way better Bollywood actors than Anil Kapoor and we all know that Dev Patel and Frieda Pinto have built a reputation that they themselves will find very hard to supersede. Also, Slumdog Millionaire portrayed India and Mumbai, my hometown, in a negative light. I still have to explain to my Brit friends here in the UK that Mumbai does not consist of slums and that half the customer service calls they make are answered from a place that's 10 minutes from where I live.Based on the book 'Between a Rock and Hard Place' by mountaineer Aron Ralston, 127 Hours is a true story about life and how we need a jolt sometimes to wake us up to the realities that we take for granted. In Ralston's case, it was a very harsh reality that gave him overnight popularity but the ordeal that he went through for 127 Hours changed him as a person. The movies draws parallels with Castaway, or more recently with the Chilean miners in terms of the body's will to survive at any given cost.The thing that stays with you long after 127 Hours is over is James Franco. 127 Hours is a films that will transcended him from an actor with a cute face to a serious talent. Like when Leonardo DiCaprio did Titanic you knew here was a superstar in the making. Franco has been used to playing second fiddle to Spiderman, but 127 Hours is all about him! He brings believability to a character in the throes of duress.The story of Aron Ralston needed a character who could be realistic enough to watch be a carefree bird and adventurer yet bearable to watch severing his hand. Franco has the charm and the suave to be a ladies man, yet hes make you believe each of his hallucinations and makes you laugh at his pain with him during some of the deepest moments of the film. If this performance does not get him a Best Actor nod at the Oscars this year, I'll be tempted to cut off my own hand. How great will it be for an Oscar presenter to win the Oscars. I wonder when was the last time that happened!A.R.Rahman does a fabulous job again with the music. It's challenging because the music could have been dark and morose and still worked well but he works with Boyle's moods in this film turning up the grungy guitars at parts yet hitting hollow strings during its lighter moments. 'If I Rise' is a mellow composition with Dido and himself. It may not be the 'Jai Ho' that the world danced to, but it talks about resurrection within its serene atmospheres, which is the main emotion of the film.Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy have outdone themselves yet again. They could have focused on the way Ralston mended his relationships or the fame Ralston achieved after he went home. Yet they chose to keep the film simple. There are barely any secondary characters, yet it is the emotional journey of a man who believes in life. 127 Hours is a story about living and that's exactly how they have panned it out. The shots are mostly close-ups focusing on the emotions of the character and the scenes where he amputates his arm have been done exactly as they may have been done in real life, nothing made 'aesthetic' for the sake of dramatization.When you leave the theater, its like you actually went through that ordeal and few films leave you with that feeling. True, it may have been claustrophobic at times, but thats exactly how they wanted it to be. You could literally feel his pain, his anguish, his despair, his loss and his hope and for that all credit goes to Danny Boyle and James Franco.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
1 1/2 hours,"127 Hours is truly unique movie. I have waited for it some time. Now I have finally seen it. I didn't have to disappoint. I usually don't watch trailers and I must say the film was exactly what I pictured it. Still I liked it very much though. It gives you gripping view of one of the ultimate true story survivors. It has some really ghastly scenes but it made the movie more real. You don't see that kinda stuff often, so it's definitely worth a look.James Franco (Aron Ralston) gives his greatest performance ever. This is by far the best acting he has done. A certain Oscar nominee at least.Aron Ralston spent 127 hours stuck in the fault line. You can get that experience with less than an hour and a half. Take that chance. You'll still be fine after that.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
I'm thinking i need a break from this genre!,"I have read a lot of reviews on this flick and think people are taking this film for its philosophical sense rather than my own opinion of the film which was more on the level of show me something i haven't seen before. I have said it before that the film's star James Franco will be one of the greats in the near future and i still stand by that quote 100%. One trait i like in my ever growing list of favourite actors in the biz today is the fact that they can capture the essence of the actual moment that their pertaining character they are portraying more than likely felt at that given time which is bringing a certain sense to the films of today and that is the sense that Hollyweird lacks in as of late, the sense of realism. Franco plays real life veteran mountain climber Aron Ralston, who after a mishap during one of his ventures gets trapped in a crevice in an isolated canyon in Utah. Leaving him all alone with only his own demons to conquer. I know human error leading towards the most compelling 'need to survive' stories that make it to the big screen are usually the ones that capture our hearts, however maybe i need to give this certain realm of motion picture a much needed rest for awhile. this reviewer left this film feeling meh! It was alright when most viewers were more along the lines of the wow! factor. Personal tastes i guess?",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
A truly captivating and forever memorable story about the human will to survive.,"Danny Boyle's very good film Slumdog Millionaire scooped eight Oscars. 127 Hours his follow up has been nominated for 3 Golden Globes and already eighteen other nomination categories, which includes Best Leading Man, James Franco. Frankly 127 Hours deserves a handful of these. This movie grabbed my attention straight away, from the first shot. Throughout we see the camera split in two screens, hand-held, documentary style like camera and conventional shooting. The first minute shows a marvellous split screen montage, which is then split into three as we are introduced to James Franco's character based on a true story Aron Ralston who whilst hiking and climbing in the canyons of Utah comes across two pretty female hikers Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn) who are lost, he helps them find their way and they find out is a cocky, daredevil free type guy who likes to have fun when they jump into a large pool from climbing in between two walls that opens into a large cave face. I felt the rush and adrenaline as he and the girls jumped into the pool as though I was actually there and that's what makes this thing even more authentic with the way it was shot and the fact it is based on a true story.Eventually though he leaves them to do his own thing but falls down a small canyon and gets his right arm stuck between the wall and large rock. This happens about twenty minutes in and from the look in Aron's eyes it's clear he never faced this sort of helplessness before. From here we really get inside the character's head as he tries desperately to escape trying several methods, whilst at the same time trying to survive on little food and water as he talks into his video-camera about how he feels as he begins to hallucinate as his situation deteriorates rapidly over the five days he is stuck there. From being trapped Aron starts to realise his selfishness at how he has lived his life and treated other people like not keeping in contact with his parents, by taking them for granted and his unwillingness to commit. All these are told in flashbacks. Also wisely throughout Aron's ordeal Boyle has added a few moments of bleak humour that lightens the mood slightly and gives the film a better balance.127 Hours is truly a film that perfectly captures the human spirit and will to survive as we see Aron desperately trying to escape his predicament. We the audience are fully versed to Aron's fear and regrets, as I felt whilst watching it, the fact I sometimes take my family for granted and for a movie to do that, make the viewer pause and reflect on themselves is not something that is easily done, which makes the film all the more clever for it. Not only that you are tuned to the notion of coming to care about him and want him to get out as I related to him, you can place yourself in his shoes imagining yourself in a similar situation. The stylish camera-work helps reinforce that but so does James Franco's performance, I quite like him in the Spiderman films, but this was more real-life, serious drama and a role that challengingly flexed him and he worked up to it, with a performance of his life. It was tremendous and he has already been nominated for an award, which is richly deserved. As to far as the amputation scene, it is very brutal, yes and if you are squeamish of blood I wouldn't recommend it but the full impact is shortened in the film so it isn't as shocking as it seems and I have seen worse. 127 Hours though I can recommend fully for those who want to find a simple but incredibly fascinating true story of character. I saw my first film of the year last week, which was The Next Three Days with Russell Crowe, which was excellent, but this was even better. This film is serious contender for best film of 2011 so far, but there are still eleven months to go so we'll see. Let's hope 2011 for terrific films continues. 127 Hours truly is one of the most memorable films I have ever seen and I can't give it higher praise than that.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
I am a Rock,"A few years ago, while boarding the tube, I missed my footing and fell down the gap between the platform and the train. Just in time, I managed to hook my elbows onto the carriage floor, while performing the can-can from the waist down. I knew I had only seconds before the unthinkable happened... and then a young French tourist with a big red rucksack hauled me inside.The point being: at no stage did I feel like I was in a Danny Boyle movie. Time steadfastly refused to hyperventilate, while reality in general resolutely failed to fracture into a series of dizzying hyperkinetic edits. No banging tunes. If I'm honest, it was just really, really embarrassing.But 127 Hours is most decidedly a Boyle picture: if being trapped underneath a rock for nearly a week must feel a trifle monotonous, you wouldn't guess it from his take on Aron Ralston's memoirs. Comparisons with Touching the Void are inevitable – Aron's mishap even occurred the year Kevin Macdonald's film was released. Yet unlike 'Void, this is a weird sort of premise for an action film, in which the subject is Standing Still more often than Running and Jumping (or Crawling and Swearing). You can't blame the director, then, for wanting to jolly things along with those funny little tics of his.Ralston, played with immense conviction by James Franco, is the devil-may-care mountaineer who made headlines in 2003 after falling through a crevice and getting pinned against a canyon wall by a dislodged boulder – truly, a destiny with density. Some might call that unlucky. Or, like the delirious Ralston, firmly believe that ""From the minute I was born, every breath has been leading me to this crack in the surface of the Earth. This rock has been waiting for me all my life.""At this stage, it probably wouldn't have been useful to point out to him that life is essentially meaningless, a bunch of random events inviting any number of feeble interpretations, and thus ultimately a bad joke played on those foolish enough to ascribe innate structure or pattern to it. That probably wouldn't have helped. All the same, we can at least entertain the notion that any and all such events present opportunities for random acts of senseless kindness – or courage. As re-enacted in the film's skilfully-edited money shot, Ralston's sole stab at survival means rendering himself deficit to the sum of one right arm. (This reviewer's screening was at 9.30 in the morning, perhaps not the best time to catch a horribly authentic self-amputation. Then again, when would that optimum hour be?)The film is bookended by images of vast crowds – in triplicate; the screen splitting three ways to accommodate the great churn of humanity, from whom reckless Ralston will deliberately extricate himself – and then, in the way of Boyle movies from Trainspotting to The Beach, desperately attempt to rejoin.There's also cackling irony in the fact that while Ralston's trapped, the screen fair teems with other people, via memories of his family, past girlfriends – even premonitory visions of a future son. If you were wondering how fellow cast members slotted into such a solitary story, they're all down there in Blue John Canyon, in James Franco's bonce.Yet strangely, he never seems so alone as during those first few moments following his extrication. Baptised in blood and sweat, he is transformed into a spirit as mighty, as elemental, but just as isolated, as that vast ancient canyon. That boulder didn't just happen to Ralston; he faced the old bastard on equal terms. And gave it the finger.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Never give up in Life,"This was one of the most underrated movies to make it to this year's Oscars.But such was the presence of all the other movies that 127 Hours failed to impress the jury, but nevertheless this is one of the best movies that Danny Boyle has ever made. Movies based on real life stories always have a powerful ending and boy, Boyle really makes you cry at the end.The plot might seem pretty straightforward, but James Franco has put in an absolute blinder of a performance. Mind you,hogging the limelight for the entire length of the movie is no easy task, and Franco delivers with a commanding and powerful performance. This movie teaches you one thing, Never lose hope and always love back the people who love you.The soundtrack is awesome and makes the movie more intense. ""If i rise"" at the end by AR Rahman and Dido is a class act. Too bad it lost out on the Oscars. But surely this is one of the best ever adaptation of a real life story. Hats off to you Mr Boyle and most importantly to Aaron Ralston. This movie will surely inspire many people.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The cult of Danny Boyle,With so much praise heaped on this it almost seems like heresy to criticise 127 hours. However Danny Boyles output is as erratic as any movie director and for some reason like a handful of other directors he can do no wrong in some peoples minds.True story adaptations depicting triumph out of adversity require audience buy in like Alive or The Killing Fields as examples but 127 fails on every level. MTV style directing alert along with the use of split screen as a gimmick on top of which James Franco gives an awful performance . His character comes across as so irritating that after half an hour i A) wanted the film to end and B) couldn't care less about Franco's character (even though like most i knew what was coming) For all the publicity surrounding 127 hours it did not perform so well at the box office. You can also expect to see a lot of unsold dvds on offer nestling between other unsold turkeys like Skyline and London Boulevard when it is released for home entertainment.,1.0,Anonymous,Biography
An interesting watch,"'127 Hours' by Danny Boyle is based on the true story of climber Aron Ralston who ventured into the gorgeous Blue John Canyon in Utah back in 2003. He had not informed anyone where he was headed and wasn't carrying a mobile phone either. While there, he runs into two girls who seem a tad smitten with this carefree, risk-taking, self-confident young man. Their admiration for him extends to them inviting him over to their party that's taking place later that night. Aron tells them he'll be there and heads on further.Just moments later, Aron's tryst with fate begins. While exploring a dangerous canyon drop, he trips and falls. What falls along with him is a now dislodged boulder that ends up jamming his right arm firmly against the wall of the canyon. It is the moment this happens, that the look on Aron's face (played by James Franco) changes colors instantly. This incident takes place about 15 minutes into the movie and it is then that the credits read – '127 Hours'.Aron is now trapped hopelessly. His lung busting screams are to no avail in that uninhabited wilderness of rocks and dust. With an extremely limited supply of food and water, Aron now has to figure out a way to get out of there. He has to gather his thoughts by constantly reminding himself not to panic and carefully plan his escape. He has to figure out what he will take, and more importantly, what he will leave behind. Either he can die there with all his limbs intact or get out of there by making some tough – extremely tough - decisions. With just a blunt pocketknife to help him make this life altering move, Aron begins his battle to stay alive.The title of the movie is essentially about two things – one, about the duration of his ordeal in that cave and two, about the time he needed to make the choices he eventually ended up making. Somehow, the second aspect mentioned here seems the primary focus of the story. It is in these 127 hours that Aron sees images from his past, present and future as he hallucinates back and forth between his family, ex-girlfriend and friends. He records all the goings on via his digital camcorder and camera including some confessions. He even etches a crude obituary to himself on the cave's wall convinced that he'll probably not make it out of there alive. But is this really what he truly believes? Or would he rather snap his arm against the cave's wall and chop it off to break free?The film isn't violent per say yet has a beautiful poetic shade of human suffering. There is something both entertaining and tragic to watch a rational human being trapped mercilessly under a boulder. While it certainly highlights just how vulnerable humans really are, it also acts as a reminder that there is no such thing as a 'lifeless nature'. Aron's monologue as to how that boulder – possibly a product of billions of years of formation – was just waiting for the day the two would meet, truly highlights the core essence of the story. It is a test of his willpower in the face of nature's little gauntlet that has been thrown at him. It is also a reminder to the rest of us that nothing is ever permanent. Even something as simple as a drop of water can sometimes become the only reason for our desire to live. This reminder, more than anything else, is the true horror of '127 hours'.James Franco is brilliant as Aron Ralston. Despite the physical constraints of being stuck in one single position for most of the movie, James brings to the screen a wide plethora of emotions which make us feel with him, fear with him, empathize with him and finally, root for him. Boyle excels in this form of storytelling where a piece of rock ends up becoming such an integral part of the narrative. Visually, the film captures the rocky mountains splendidly as does the apt soundtrack by AR Rahman. It is this juxtaposition of human fragility against a product of billions of years, that makes 127 hours a memorable, relevant and inspiring watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An audio-visual representation of genuine human emotion,"It has only been about an hour since I saw this film and I still can't come up with the right words to articulate this overwhelming feeling. Ripping it down to its rawest form presents a very simple story about a man, Aron Ralston, who faces death in doing what he likes the most, canyoneering. This is a film that doesn't rely solely on how the film concludes. Instead, the point is embedded in the longevity of the story in the film itself. It is the experience of getting stuck in what may seem to be just a crack in the middle of a canyon, wherein human emotion in its truest form can still be felt by the audience, that I saw its significance and its relevance. This is a very unlikely plot to generate an experience that represents raw emotions, yet nothing short in authenticity.Putting the plot in the context of filmmaking, there are just too many aspects in this film that are very well put together for me to dissect and criticize. Everything was placed in the right place at the right time. The utilization as well as the style of editing, cinematography, sound editing, sound mixing and musical scoring all worked harmoniously in the audio-visual representation of the story.127 Hours is one of those films where one actor will have to carry the whole film to either its success or its demise. Fortunately, actor James Franco has gone a long way in his acting career by making the right decisions or else, he might not have made it to Aron Ralston's place, stuck in that deep gorge. The true-to-life story adapted in Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy's screenplay requires a young character who is extreme and strong-hearted especially during difficult times, yet has his deep relationships with the people around him as both his weakness and his strength. This complicated, yet true of a character, I could not have imagined being portrayed by any other actor.This symphony by Danny Boyle has once again proved himself to be a visionary filmmaker contributing to my world a picture worth consuming.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Don't give up,"Who can make a movie about a guy who is trapped by a boulder a captivating movie? Well Danny Boyle can, this was a really engaging and captivating movie and most although most audiences will know the outcome. You still really care about the character and all the hardship he had to go through. James Franco did a phenomenal job playing Aron Ralston and made his character really likable. This film is shot so well that I actually felt like I was there with Aron Ralston, except I am just the audience so I can't do anything to help which made the experience more tense and painful to watch. Not because it's a bad movie, far from it but because of how realistic and captivating everything is. From the build up to almost everything else is done very well and will leave a impact when it's finished.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Danny Boyle did it again !!!,"This movie has no visible weak points (for me, a ordinary viewer). First, the acting of MR. James Franco, incredible. You can feel (and see)the emotions through him, the joy, the happiness, the drama of be trapped, the transformation of a adventure man to a little tiny man trapped by the nature. The Cinematography is awesome...you'll never gonna see the desert, the canyons, the unmerciful sun, the sunset, like this before and after...great work!!!.The music, also incredible, the right melodies at the rights moments, the blood boils. The editing work is a great point of this movie, a mix of commercial spots, families flashback, nightmares, radio talk shows, sitcoms, prints a unique style of movie. remarkable.

"If there was ever a story that needed to be told, it's this one.","The phrase 'remarkably true story' gets thrown around a lot these days. Sure, some of the greatest films of all time are shaped by actual events (see: Goodfellas, Dog Day Afternoon and Cool Runnings), as are a handful of contemporary Best Picture hopefuls in The King's Speech, The Social Network and 127 Hours. But the latter is perhaps the only one that really has the ability to connect with the viewer on such an emotional level. This film presents to us an amazing story of survival and human will in the face of certain death, expertly delivered by director Danny Boyle and Best Actor nominee James Franco.I make the point to not divulge too many plot details in my reviews, but I feel an exception can be made in this case, since the story is so well known. Aron Ralston is a mountain climber intent on journeying through the treacherous Blue John Canyon in Utah. He meets two girls along the way, but continues on his own. He slips while climbing down a narrow rock face, causing a small avalanche in which a boulder traps him between, literally, a rock and a hard place. With his food and water supply running low, and his hallucinations becoming more intense, Aron realises the only way to free himself is to hack off his own arm, after which he ventures out of the canyon and is rescued just before bleeding to death.Danny Boyle is a director with great skill in exposing his audience to the very ends of the Earth. Be it the gloomy backstreets of Trainspotting, or the vibrant Indian flavour of Slumdog Millionaire, he always ensures the setting dosen't just fulfil its role, but stands out as a piece of art. 127 Hours is no different, as vast, sweeping views of the desert and Steadycam shots inside the labyrinth that is Blue John Canyon contribute handsomely to a foreboding sense of isolation and claustrophobia.In contrast, when Aron becomes trapped underground, it is the editing that takes over the cinematography as the primary means of fleshing out the film. Flashbacks and quick cuts allow the viewer to get inside Aron's mindset at any given point, and I found it an accurate portrayal of how, even in times of crisis and great panic, the mind can wander and emotions can change instantly. A standout scene, and a great example of what I'm trying to explain, occurs when Aron pretends he is a guest on a comedic talk show, jokingly explaining how he is about to die, only minutes after recalling how desperately he wants to see his family.If you ignore the other (very minor) roles played by the rest of his unknown cast, James Franco is the only actor in this movie, and it goes without saying that the film would collapse if his performance lacked conviction. Luckily, he puts immense effort into a screenplay the real Aron Ralston called '99.9% accurate'. His turn is unlikely to earn him Best Actor, but he certainly stamps his authority on his own film more than any other nominees do in their respective films.Of course, I couldn't review 127 Hours without giving my opinion on 'that' scene, which is alluded to in the beginning with some excellent use of foreshadowing, by the way. Is it gruesome? I wouldn't dispute that. It is glorified, existing only to disgust? Absolutely not. I couldn't take my eyes of the screen, only because I was keen to see for myself the amount of realism injected into such an intense moment. And believe me, it is intense. Personally, not sickening. But if in doubt, I'd say proceed with caution.Ultimately, though, it's best not to dwell on this single scene, but appreciate the entire film addressing the idea that life is not about what is lost through adversity, but what is gained through determination. What a shame that my three favourite films this year have, collectively, slim-to-nil chance of winning the top prize.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

James Franco's Best Performance,"Movies that are anchored in a single location (in this case, a canyon in Utah) appeal to me. I love the idea that movies of this nature rely on the talent of the performer and not so much on action, special effects, etc. Celebrated filmmaker Danny Boyle adapts the true life story of adventurous outdoorsman Aron Ralston. Ralston has been quoted in regards to the accuracy of the film as saying it's as close as you can get to a documentary while still being a narrative film. Ralston is known for a disastrous adventure into the canyons of Utah in which he was doing some hiking and, after a nasty fall, found himself trapped with a boulder pinning his arm to the canyon wall. For the following couple of days, Ralston documented his experience with his small video camera and survived on what little food he'd brought and a dwindling water supply. The end of the film has become famous for the extreme lengths Ralston had gone to to free himself from the canyon. I'm sure everyone knows how the film ends by this point, but in the event that someone reading this is oblivious, I'll avoid mentioning it. Needless to say, it's pretty painful to watch.Before 127 HOURS, I'd only known actor James Franco as Harry Osborn from Sam Raimi's SPIDER-MAN trilogy and a spaced-out pot dealer in PINEAPPLE EXPRESS. I was more than a little skeptical that Franco, who I hadn't seen in any serious sort of role, could pull off carrying a dramatic picture by himself. But I suppose I should've given director Danny Boyle the benefit of the doubt that he knew what he was doing. Franco does a great job. He's a talented man, and his work in 127 HOURS proves it. Over the course of Ralston's time trapped in the canyon, Franco runs the gamut from determined and hopeful to ready for the inevitable and he does such a fine job that he brings the audience along with him. Ralston's constant updates into his camcorder give us some insight into what he's going through, seeing as how he has no one to talk to. Franco is powerful as he reaches out to his parents whom he knows won't receive his message until after he's found (most likely too late). He reminisces back to mistakes he's made and moments he regrets, his entrapment giving him a new view on life.Now yes, Danny Boyle is a great director but I know what's most likely to be the bigger selling point for the film is the final act in which Ralston gets down to business when he realizes what he's going to need to do to survive his predicament. Even those who've been desensitized to violence might have a hard time not flinching. It's not overdone and a lot of it is done off screen, but it's done incredibly well and has the audience grimacing. Keep in mind, this even doesn't happen until the last 10-15 minutes of the movie. So if it's your sole reason for inquiring into the film, you'll want to get comfortable and settle in for one of the best movies of 2010 in the meantime.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good book material perhaps, but...","this film was slow and rather tedious. The best parts of the movie were the first 5 minutes or so, when we see the ""hero"" cavorting in the outdoors amidst beautiful scenery, and the last 5 minutes or so, when the he cuts off his arm to free himself and encounters shocked and horrified hikers. Despite the notoriety surrounding the particular incident depicted in this film, it's still essentially a survival story. That genre isn't exactly new, but the director here fees he has to do something different so instead of focusing on the build-up of the character we get endless, moody flashbacks that are essentially irrelevant and uninteresting and serve only to take us out of the moment. I was somewhat confused as to what exactly the main character did for a living. Did he work in some sporting goods store? If so, why not introduce the character showing him giving good advice to customers (i.e., don't hike alone, tell family and friends where you're going, etc.) and then contrast that with his own rash behavior as he set off alone.And we never see the incident from another's perspective, such as the rescue personnel, the doctors, or even the hikers who discover the injured man. Why not build up the moment when hikers come across the injured Ralston. As audience members, we can never know Ralston's pain and suffering, but we can put ourselves in the place of the hikers who found and helped Ralston. Their shock, horror, and confusion, would be palpable and understandable, but instead those people are just an afterthought. This film focuses entirely on the thoughts and feelings of Ralston, and that's a weakness. James Franco is fine as Aaron Ralston, but the script and the direction lets him down.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
127 hrs review,"An amazing movie, with the main character finding himself in a very hard place, injured and trapped. Its very nerve wrecking and kept me on the edge of my sit. If you are a fan of hicking then this one is definately a winner for you. Its an interestong movie as it keeps one at glue to the screen wanting to see the wnd result. A movie of survival always takes you to the imaginery world were u start imagining yourself in that situation and ways on how one can come up with plans to survive. The movie is a rollercoaster of emotions, were you are at some point gripped with fear,anticipation and hope.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Heartwarming,Felt every motion and to think it's based on true life events made even more touching. The will to live made it possible for the guy to survive. Where they is a will they is way. Having a camera to record his events and also watch his previous adventures made the situation he was in bearable and hopeful that things are going to be ok. The situation of him being down there in a hole that deep shows how strong he was both physically and mentally and managed to stay positive and strong .Also looking at the magnificent views of the location whr theovie was shot. Its just breathtaking must see movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Impressed,"What an intense and gripping film. I highly recommend 127 Hours to anyone who loves a good true story, suspenseful dramaor inspirational film. Aron Ralston is brave how can one survive with no phone , food and no water. He used his wot and resources to survive the harsh conditions and find a way to escape. Aron Ralston performance is nothing short of phenomenal. He brings a depth and nuance to the character conveying the complexity of Aron emotions as he struggles to come to terms with his situation. I can nominate the film thousands times as the best picture, best director and best actor for Aron.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Emotional experience of unforgettable amplitude!,"Brilliant in all sorts of way! Marvelous acting, great directing and editing. You get a clear message, there are no distractions in the movie, it's great to watch. Beautiful nature at the beginning turning into horror in just a few minutes. Experiencing the unbearable pain, the unstandable emotional drama...the really great acting done by James Franco makes you almost feel everything he feels and experiencing everything he experiences...you can feel a great pain in your chest and almost can't watch/stand it anymore but you just have to and can't do anything else but enhance the moment and experience this great emotions that you might have never felt before.It's an emotional masterpiece that makes you feel the ""perfect"" pain.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

How good can a movie about a man stuck in a cave really be?,"That's what I had always told myself when this movie popped up as a recommendation. It seemed interesting and I had heard all about the arm cutting scene and how people supposedly fainted when they saw it in the theaters, etc, etc. But I never bothered with it until now.I loved this movie. Now, maybe a bigger movie buff than me will think that 9/10 is a bit overkill, but at this moment I am genuinely wowed by everything this movie did. From the cinematography to the music, the acting, the directing... everything just fell perfectly in line.This movie is a testament to the human instinct for survival and James Franco's acting sells it. I have nothing more to say. This is a great movie and it holds up incredibly well over a decade later. My only regret is that I didn't watch it sooner.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Powerful One Man Performance From James Franco,"Clearly, James Franco's performance as Aron Ralston is the highlight of this movie. Franco is basically putting on a one-man show for probably 90% of the running time and he (and director Danny Boyle) manage to keep the story flowing effortlessly, and draw the viewer into the nightmare that Ralston has literally fallen into. Ralston is a rock climber who makes the tragic mistake of going climbing alone without telling anyone where he would be going. A fall into a deep crevice traps his arm against a canyon wall and the movie is the account of Ralston's fight to survive, based on the book that he wrote about this experience. In that sense, there's no real mystery about what the outcome will be - the movie is based on Ralston's own book, and acknowledges that off the top. Obviously he survives. The question is how. Franco brilliantly portrays Ralston's growing desperation (which begins more as frustration as he assumes that he'll find a way out but gradually realizes that getting out is going to be a lot more difficult than he at first thought.) As his food and water run out and as he battles insects and cold nights and comes to terms with his life and some of the mistakes he's made you get drawn into his situation. Even if you've never read the book, you basically know how this situation is going to be resolved but that doesn't take away from the movie's power. In some respects I might compare this to the movies ""Alive"" or ""World Trade Centre"" - each of which deal with somewhat similar circumstances of people trapped in nightmarish situations wondering how they're going to get out. The difference here is the one-man nature of the story.In addition to Franco's performance, the on location filming offers starkly beautiful pictures of the canyon environment. From a strictly personal perspective (and this is merely a matter of taste I suppose) I didn't care for much of the musical score (especially the opening music) and I'm not really a big fan of split screens, which occur periodically throughout this. Overall, though, from the simple perspective of the story (which is, of course, what really counts) I'd say this is a must see.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Extremely Deep,"At first I didn't think/read of anything about the film so as not to ruin the story for myself. As a kid, I used to experience same situations; Even if they were so Insignificant and fearless comparing to Aron's story, I really understood the feelings that Aron got... Thinking about past joys, thinking of cool drinks and delicious foods, thinking about past mistakes, including not answering his mother's call... The film well portrayed Aron's thoughts, Aron was captivated by the sense of freedom he saw in that bird, the feeling of an ant walking on his knife, ... I have to say that the choice of music, which was played by Aron's sister, that is, a piece by Frederick Chopin, was very clever and professional. As far as I know, Chopin himself came up with such thoughts when he was sick in bed, and this resemblance, that is, Chopin's attitude to life, and the thoughts that Aron recreates with Chopin's piece is really really amazing...",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unexpectedly Good,"A very good movie.""127 Hours is a gripping, emotional, and visually stunning film. James Franco delivers a captivating performance as Aron Ralston, bringing depth and nuance to the true story. Danny Boyle's masterful direction creates a sense of tension and urgency, keeping you on the edge of your seat. A must-see for its cinematic beauty, powerful storytelling, and inspiring human spirit. It shows the resilience of a person when stuck in a corner. The fact i found out it was a true story made me even wonder about the person in real life and brought out a fear of mine.

Great movie even if it did leave me traumatized,"It's been a few days since I watched this and I'm still feeling kinda traumatized, I just can't get that scene with the tendon out of my head. All in this is a pretty fantastic movie, beautifully filmed, exciting, multilayered and wow James Franco who, for the most part carries this all by himself.Its based on the real life events adventurer Aron Ralston faced while trapped in a Utah canyon for five days with his hand stuck under a boulder and how he eventually resorted to desperate measures in order to escape. Ralston filmed a daily video diary while he was stuck and in a lot of the scenes its Franco talking to his little camera, sending a goodbye message to his parents as he gets weaker and weaker from lack of water and his thoughts and (flashback) memories get more bizarre.There were moments watching this when I actually felt sick and I'm not talking about the obvious parts (those were brutal and I watched ""that"" scene peeking through my fingers) but the entire movie made me feel anxious, starting with the foreshadowing of him packing, showing all the food and water and him trying unsuccessfully to find his Swiss army knife, just out of reach on the shelf. The scene with the flood is awesome as is the one where he slides down the chute with the two girls -there is no way I could have done that, so freaky. His determination to survive and finally ASK for help is remarkable. 6/28/14",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Beyond Inspirational, Superbly Directed and Brilliantly Acted","Just finished watching 127 Hours, I still have the credits and song playing in the background. Kind of speechless right now with what I just watched. I feel like I was trapped in a canyon with my arm stuck. Where to start.Boyle is on top of his game with this one and right away you can tell its a Danny Boyle movie. It has fast cuts, hand held camera work and a beautifully appropriate constructed soundtrack. Using all these tools he places you right in Aaron Ralston shoes, and they are not the shoes you want to be in. We are introduced to Aaron, played by Franco, getting ready for a hiking expedition and his journey as he gets there. He rides his bike 17 miles, locks it up and then hikes running into two girl hikers. He helps them on their way and shows them a ton of fun. Through the prelude here, we see that Aaron is a fun loving guy, living for the thrill of living, the rush, he just wants to be outdoors, which will ultimately put him through hell. I thought this had one of the better preludes of a film in a while, with upbeat music, beautifully shot scenery, your ready to join him yourself. It's not until a rock falls and is lodged between the canyon wall and his arm are we shown the title 127 Hours, and with Franco's terrified face. Just an awesome shot, and really all we need to see to understand what is to come.For the next Hour and fifteen minutes we are with Aaron, stuck. We are dealing with Aaron's mortality, and thus thinking of our own. From here Boyle direction and Franco's acting places you in the canyon. He uses extreme close ups on Franco's face repeatedly to instill a sense of claustrophobia and fear (this more so due to Franco's acting). There are even shots from the inside of his thermos and camel back, placing you in Aaron's mind. Imagining the water flowing to you and becoming less and less. There are few times he will use a shot that pans back from the canyon and displays the empty desert creating for the audience Aaron's loneliness and crushing reality of his surroundings. The sound was an especially well done aspect, specifically with the water. Boyle cranks up the sound of the water sloshing around in the thermos, or going through the hose in the camel back, you'll actually get thirsty while watching. While Boyle places the audience in the canyon with his direction the writing and Franco make us start to deal with our own mortality.Throughout the time in the canyon, you are constantly shown flashbacks and memories of Aaron's leading up to the event. He starts out with what we all would start with, regret about not telling anyone where he was going, what he should have brought with him, etc. As time goes on he starts to think about life, how he treated people that he loved, and what he's leaving behind. Up until the climatic vision that gives him the strength to survive. And really who wouldn't be doing this. He constantly is keeping record on his video camera, keeping his own sanity as well as the audience's. Really the whole time you are thinking that that's probably what you yourself would be doing and thinking thus really making you think about your own life.Its an extremely powerful film. Inspirational, depressing, scary, and the climax of the film is grotesquely real. Its such an unbelievable amazing true story of survival and what the human body and mind are capable of. I'd say go out and enjoy it, but I don't know if enjoy is the right word. I can guarantee that you will be moved and inspired by this film due to Boyles direction, Franco's acting, and of course the real Aaron Ralston.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"To long, to boring, to mediocre","First of all, I have to admit that I have no sympathy for people who voluntarily put themselves in such situations. Nevertheless, i knew his story from the internet and was fascinated by his surviving story, that's why I wanted to see the film.After the first few minutes i was like ""omg"" how can he seriously pack his bags and after 10 seconds give up looking for his pocket knife. It was so clear it would matter and of course he doesn't tell anyone which route he takes.In one moment of the film he unpacks his luggage in front of him and I thought ""wtf""... I would go camping with more practical things than him, and he wanted to go hiking for 2 days.The tension was ok so far, but I guess I expected something different.The nature shots are really beautiful. The music on the other hand is mostly awful. And I got ""the revenant"" flashbacks, much grunting and so on, everything with the camera nearly shoved into his face...All in all, it's rather mediocre, I just can't stand the character, I've noticed. Such reckless people...I can't stand it. Made it barely to the ending...my eyes hurt.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Scintillating,"A catchy movie that appeals to all the 5 senses and carries you within the story with ease. Review of 172 Hours172 Hours is an intense and captivating movie that grips its audience from start to finish. Directed by an up-and-coming filmmaker, this cinematic masterpiece offers a harrowing yet inspirational journey of survival, endurance, and the strength of the human spirit. The film combines powerful storytelling, stunning visuals, and stellar performances to deliver an unforgettable experience.The plot revolves around a young mountaineer, Alex Carter, who embarks on a solo expedition to conquer the treacherous peak of Mount Celeste. What begins as an adventure of self-discovery quickly turns into a fight for survival when Alex gets trapped in an isolated crevasse. The film is a fictionalized retelling of the protagonist's 172 hours of struggle against nature, solitude, and his own limitations.The narrative unfolds with a compelling pace, balancing moments of quiet introspection with nail-biting suspense. The screenplay is brilliantly crafted, immersing viewers in Alex's journey while weaving flashbacks of his life before the expedition. These flashbacks add emotional depth, showing the relationships he values and the dreams that motivate him. They also provide a stark contrast to his dire situation, amplifying the tension and making the stakes feel deeply personal.One of the strongest aspects of 172 Hours is its lead performance. The actor portraying Alex, Chris Donovan, delivers a career-defining portrayal. His ability to convey a wide range of emotions - from confidence and determination at the beginning of his journey to fear, despair, and eventual hope - is nothing short of remarkable. The physical transformation he undergoes as the story progresses enhances the authenticity of his character. Donovan's commitment to the role is evident in every scene, making Alex's struggle feel raw and real.The cinematography is another standout feature of the film. The breathtaking shots of Mount Celeste's snowy expanses and towering cliffs contrast sharply with the claustrophobic close-ups inside the crevasse. These visuals not only highlight the beauty and brutality of nature but also create a visceral sense of Alex's isolation. The use of natural lighting, particularly during sunrise and sunset, adds a poetic touch, symbolizing fleeting moments of hope amidst despair.Equally impressive is the sound design, which plays a crucial role in immersing the audience. The creaking of ice, the howling wind, and the muffled sounds of Alex's breathing create an atmosphere of tension and urgency. The hauntingly beautiful score, composed by a renowned musician, complements the visuals perfectly, evoking both the majesty and menace of the mountain.Thematically, 172 Hours explores profound ideas about human resilience, the value of life, and the connections that sustain us. Alex's reflections during his ordeal reveal the regrets and joys that define him, encouraging viewers to ponder their own priorities and relationships. The film's message is ultimately uplifting, reminding us that even in the darkest moments, hope and determination can lead to triumph.If there's a minor critique, it might be that some of the flashback sequences feel slightly prolonged, momentarily disrupting the momentum of the main storyline. However, these moments are few and far between and do little to detract from the overall impact of the film.172 Hours is not just a survival story; it's a deeply human tale that resonates on multiple levels. Its combination of gripping storytelling, emotional depth, and technical excellence makes it a must-watch for fans of adventure dramas and character-driven narratives.In the end, the film leaves a lasting impression, not only for its harrowing depiction of survival but also for its celebration of the indomitable human spirit. 172 Hours is a cinematic triumph that deserves all the accolades it has received and more. Whether you're drawn to the suspense of survival films or the emotional weight of personal journeys, this movie is sure to move and inspire you.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great performance from Franco.,"I applaud the film for being as entertaining and engrossing as it could possibly be, considering it's about a guy who gets his hand trapped by a big boulder and he just stands there for the rest of the film. I knew Danny Boyle would be able to pull it off though, the guy is talented.Aron Ralston, an adrenalin junkie, becomes trapped under a boulder while canyoneering by by his lonesome in Utah. He tries all he can to escape, but it's not enough, until he's faced with the alternative, death. He takes drastic measures to ensure his life will prevail.I walked away from the film with one thought in my mind, could I do the same thing. Well, for one thing I wouldn't be alone, but in this situation, I would definitely try everything I could to try and get out of that situation first. Would I pass out from cutting off my own arm? Who knows, but I do know that the will to live is indeed a powerful thing. The film displays this tremendously.Beautifully shot and wonderfully edited, the film grabs you from the moments it starts and never lets you go. I was astonished to hear that some people were bored by it. Given the circumstances, I asked what did they expect from a movie about a guy who's trapped by a boulder. The real Ralston has stated that the film is as close to the real thing as anything, it could be a documentary. Another feat accomplished by Boyle and Franco, to truly capture the man in his most desperate moments. Ralston gave his seal of approval to the film and the performance, so do I.The scene in which he has to cut off his own arm is not as graphic as I expected. It surely does look real enough though. I can easily recommend this film, Boyle delivers another great film that he can add to his impressive resume. Franco gives his best performance to date.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another classic from Boyle,"Director Danny Boyle's no stranger to producing ground breaking movies, stylishly shot, pounding soundtracks, involving plots and great characters, and '127 Hours' adds to his great resume.The incredible true story of climber Aron Ralston (James Franco) who whilst exploring the isolated canyons of Utah, slips and find's himself pinned to a canyon wall by a boulder.The hours go by, these turn to days, his water is running out, he come's to the realization that the only way to escape will be to cut his own arm off....with a blunt pocket knife.There are similarity's to the excellent 'Buried' but this is a different kind of film as we experience flashbacks into Aron's past, how he became a selfish 'loner', he makes a video diary, expressing his regrets at not caring for others as much as he should have.Franco is excellent, the scene when he films an imaginary talk show with himself is brilliantly acted and also a great comedy moment.Don't let the subject matter put you off (yes it will make you wince-the sound effect when he cuts through a nerve!!!!) this is a great film, finely acted and beautifully shot, and in some sort of sense, a feel good flick!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Frenetic pace and jazzed up music-video style,"127 Hours is a dramatization of outdoorsman Aron Ralston's desperate attempt to survive a fall into the bottom of an isolated canyon that pinned his right hand under a huge rock. The film is directed by Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire) and written by Simon Beaufroy who based the screenplay on Aron Ralston's memoir, ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place."" From the opening scene we know we are in for a wild ride. Boyle has the audience immediately climbing the walls with pounding music and rapid fire sequences shown on split screens that display crowds cheering, people running, and a frenzy of movement, perhaps in an attempt to show the random chaos of Ralston's existence.Soon we see Ralston, an experienced hiker, speeding along on his dirt bike in Utah's Blue John Canyon in Canyonlands National Park as he undertakes in his own words, ""a capriciously impromptu vacation."" In bravura style, he doesn't tell anyone where he is going and is only equipped with a pocket knife, a bottle of water, a video recorder, some candy bars, a camera and a backpack. Presumably cell phones weren't invented at the time. Using cinematographers Anthony Dod Mantle and Enrique Chediak, the beauty of the canyon has never been as vividly displayed. When Aron meets two lost female hikers (Amber Tamblyn and Kate Mara), he guides them to a swimming hole shimmering in the sun where all jump in with an explosive sound and a joyous release that's palpably felt.After inviting Aron to a party on the weekend, the two hikers leave with one of them remarking that ""I don't think we figured in his day at all,"" Impatient to move on, tragedy strikes suddenly when his bike crashes into the rocks. Gripping a huge boulder to maintain his stability, he loses his balance and falls to the bottom of the canyon, his right hand pinned underneath the giant stone. Trapped and unable to move his hand, his repeated cry, ""I need help,"" signals not only his plea to be rescued but his realization about how alone he is in the world. Ralston has little water which is rapidly running out and only a small amount of food and he knows that he could die in a few days.Though we never enter any sort of dreamlike state as in Requiem for a Dream, Aron visualizes images of his life shown in super-hyped cutaways and flashbacks that recall an ex girlfriend (Clémence Poésy) that he perhaps broke up with too suddenly, a picture of his sister on her wedding day, and a vision of the future in which he sees a little boy and an unknown woman snuggling close to him. Ralston spends much of his time recording his thoughts into his camcorder (the real Ralston did the same), often playfully assuming different roles.He does becomes serious, however, when he tells his mother that he's sorry he missed her last phone call and that he loves her. As each new day dawns and Ralston is at the end of his rope both literally and figuratively, he begins to realize that the only way out is to take the ultimate drastic step that you may have heard about, an act shown in a brutally extended sequence that lasts four minutes and had most viewers, including this one, hiding their eyes.Franco does an impressive job in presenting Ralston as an energetic but immature individual who enjoys travelling solo, yet we learn little about the kind of person he is, and I often felt as if I was watching a performance rather than being emotionally involved with a life or death struggle. In his desire to keep us in a good mood, Boyle ratchets up the entertainment with a jazzed up, music video style that drains the impact of the unfolding drama. Though we sense that, as a result of his ordeal, Ralston will experience a renewed connection with others, we never really learn if he fully understands deep down that his aloofness may have created the problems in his life, or if his spiritual outlook has deepened. Sabotaged by Boyle's frenetic pace, 127 Hours eliminates any contemplation of the eternal silences.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beautiful Film About Will Power.,"Review:
'127 Hours' is a biographical-survival-drama film directed by Danny Boyle. It is based on Aron Ralston's memoir 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place'.
With this movie having such a small cast and actors aside from James Franco getting a small amount of screen time, the movie falls on his and Danny Boyle's shoulders.
In the film, canyoner Aron Ralston must find a way to escape after he gets trapped by a boulder in an isolated slot canyon in Bluejohn Canyon, southeastern Utah, in April 2003.
James Franco is very impressive, delivering a performance that is entirely convincing and a genuine step up for the actor. It's his movie to win or lose and he shines brightly in it making his character likable from the beginning making us want him to win.
The direction in this movie is pure art. Danny Boyle uses some great techniques and shots to move the story on. Personally, nothing feels forced or out of place, and the effects are believable and realistic. The pacing is good, and it never loses the concept of what it wants to achieve.
Overall, if you know the story then the movie is what you expect and there are no twists or turns along the way. Its story telling at its finest, and it may be simple, but when it's done like this it can be.

127 Hours - 9/10,"1. Overall Plot - 9/10
The plot of this movie is insane. And because it is completely a true story, it is just mind blowing. This movie was fantastic. I wish the arm cutting scene was longer. That is really my only problem with the plot. Because in real life it took Aron an hour to cut his arm off, and that is just shown in a few seconds in this movie. I really like the way they showed him hallucinating throughout the movie though.2. Entertainment / Engagement - 10/10
This movie is anxiety. I had major anxiety in this whole movie, but in a great way. It was very entertaining, and it kept you on the edge of your seat the whole time.The fact that this movie is a true story is amazing. It gets you super engaged in the story. Even knowing how it ends, you are still rooting for him throughout. You want to help.3. Emotion / Investment in Story - 10/10
This movie is super emotional. Not just physically, but mentally. The emotion Aron goes through is insane to watch, and I cannot fathom going through that. The feelings that this movie makes you feel is crazy. I have never cringed in pain watching a movie like I did in this one. Just thinking about what Aron went through, and how he did what he did is nuts.You get super invested in the story, and Aron. As the movie goes on, you learn more about his relationships with others, and you want him to survive.4. Theme and Depth of Story - 10/10
The theme of this one is courage, and never giving up. Everyone can tell themselves that they would do the same in that situation and survive, but thats just not true. This is a one time thing. You cannot even comprehend how mentally and physically crazy it is. Aron doing what he did is just because of his courage and will to live. He has talked about how it has completely changed him as a man.This movie is super deep. Because of it being a true story, and everything actually happening the way in the movie. In fact, the movie actually doesn't share everything crazy that he did. For example, in the film, he only cuts him arm for a little bit, but in real life it took an hour. That's crazy.5. Characters - 10/10
There isn't many characters in this. As it mainly only focuses on Aron Ralston. And Aron's story is told very good.6. Acting / Writing - 10/10
All of the acting is perfect. James Franco did amazing. Oscar nomination awesome. The writing is very accurate to what actually happened, and really makes you feel things while watching.7. Cinematography / Sets - 7/10
This movie had some very unique cinematography that I've never seen before. It wasn't bad at all, and actually fit parts of the movie very well. It just was too different for my liking, and sometimes was just too weird. I do love how they made the hallucinations. They feel very real, and the fact that sometimes you cannot tell at first what is going on is great. It shows how he felt in the moment.The setting in this movie is great. They filmed a lot of it on the actual location. The rest was in a canyon set that they built that looks completely accurate.8. Score / Sound - 8/10
This would be a six, except for one thing. The music in this movie is kinda weird, and I liked it better when there wasn't background music.The sound the movie plays when Aron is cutting his arm, and hits his nerve is crazy. It is so good for the movie. It makes you feel the pain. I don't really know how to describe it, but it is absolutely perfect.9. Editing / Pace - 10/10
I love how this was edited. You feel how insane he starts to feel.The pacing was great as well. The movie is pretty short, but doesn't feel short while watching it at all. Because you are on the edge of your seat the whole time, the movie feels a lot longer than it actually is. I just wish they spent more time on him cutting his arm.10. VFX/Practical Effects - 10/10
All of the effects are perfect, and look very real. When he cuts his arm, it looks super realistic.Average Score:
9.4/10My Overall Rating and Final Thoughts:
9/10
This movie is amazing, and everyone should watch it. It is kind of disturbing. Not because of gore, but just mentally. But that is what makes it so good. What Aron Ralston went through is crazy, and this is his story.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Every Second Counts Of this Classic Movie.,"127 Hours is a brilliant movie from the brilliant Danny Boyle. Arguably the best movie of the year,only Boyle could have made a movie about a guy trapped in a boulder with such ingenuity and craftiness.I can never imagine the state of mind that Aron Ralston was in, probably don't want to.Danny Boyle has unarguably added one more feather in his already illustrious cinematic cap by making 127 hours. The movie ironically about being a man who is static moves us a lot. It just shows that when man is really facing adverse circumstances he realizes the most important things in his life which he never would have thought in the first place.Boyle never hesitates and hence doesn't compromise in showing the explicitly graphic scenes involving blood. This makes the movie watching experience more vicarious , something that only Boyle can do with such conviction.AR Rehman's Sound track is easily tied at best for the year with social network. Rehman's work here is better compared to his previous work with Boyle, Slumdog Millionaire seeing that Rehman had a tougher job at hand while creating score for a movie that apparently never moves.James Franco has confirmed his potential as a star in the making by delivering a splendid performance. Only a stuttering King would have been able to stop him from getting all the major accolades.Overall 127 Hours is yet another must watch movie from the genius Danny Boyle, for whom my respect has grown increased by leaps and bounds. It is really sad to see that it went empty handed at most of the award ceremonies this year.Do not miss even a second as Every Second Counts .",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Outstanding.,"127 Hours really changed my thought of going out exploring without telling anyone where you're going. Very inspiring, and well-directed. I will caution those who haven't seen this movie: if you are looking for a good time in watching a movie, 127 Hours is not what you should watch. It's very emotional, but you won't be getting any spoilers from me, even though this is a true story. Just don't watch it if you have a weak stomach or are prone to fainting. It's a great movie, but not for everyone to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
This rock has been waiting for me all my life,"Its such a shame that this extraordinary film was not a box office hit. Everything is set up perfectly. James Franco performance is really intense and moving, the script has wonderful lines in it, the way Danny Boyle makes us get in the characters mind is masterful, the music and the way it is used along the movie is just breathtaking, editing is also nothing less than perfect, photography was also beautiful. Definitely this is a complete movie experience with absolutely nothing to add or take off. A wonderful and moving experience that is worth seeing more than once in the theater and of course own it on DVD and/or Blu Ray. For me this is the film that should have won the Oscar over The king speech,The social network or even black swan ( which was my favorite until I saw this powerful and unforgettable film)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Unforgettable Journey of Survival and Resilience,"Danny Boyle's 127 Hours is a masterclass in storytelling, immersing the audience in a gripping and emotionally charged journey of survival. Based on the harrowing true story of Aron Ralston, the film captures both the physical and emotional struggle of a man fighting against impossible odds.James Franco delivers a tour de force performance as Aron Ralston, embodying the character with intensity, vulnerability, and raw humanity. Franco's portrayal is nothing short of mesmerizing, carrying the weight of the story almost single-handedly and making us feel every moment of his ordeal. This is undoubtedly one of his best performances.The cinematography is breathtaking, juxtaposing the vast, rugged beauty of Utah's canyons with the claustrophobic confinement of Aron's predicament. The film's visual style, combined with A. R. Rahman's stirring score, creates an immersive experience that is both haunting and inspiring.What truly sets 127 Hours apart is its ability to find hope and humanity in the darkest of moments. It's not just a story of survival but also one of reflection, redemption, and the unyielding will to live. Boyle's direction masterfully balances tension with introspection, keeping the audience on edge while also delving deep into Aron's psyche.Though the film is intense and not for the faint-hearted, particularly during its most graphic moments, it's a profoundly moving and unforgettable cinematic experience.127 Hours is a testament to the strength of the human spirit and the power of determination. It's an emotionally impactful film that stays with you long after the credits roll. Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well made! Highly intense and at times disturbing!,"Danny Boyle became a household name in India with 'Slumdog Millionarie'. As much as it attracted criticism for typecasting India, his skills at filmmaking accumulated accolades. Boyle teams up yet again with the Maestro, AR Rahman, screenwriter Simon Beaufoy and producer Christian Colson for '127 Hours'.Shot on location at Utah, it is based on true account by Aron Ralston in his book 'Between a Rock and Hard Place'. The film deal's with the protagonist's ordeal for more than 5 days after a fallen boulder crashed on his arm and trapped him in an isolated canyon. The lack of food and his dwindling water can made it worse. James Franco (Harry Osborne in 'Spiderman') plays Aron Ralston's part to perfection.The movie doesn't dwell on whether Ralston did or didn't do something right. Rather, it is his varying emotions that take the center-stage. Amidst the rocky hopelessness around him, he reminisces his family, draws recollects his last best moments with the passersby he had just met, his thirsty thoughts traveling to the half-filled drink bottle in his car, keeping his spirit alive and finally, garnering the courage to redeem himself.The biggest challenge in a solo film is zero opportunity for dialog. The writers make up for it by interspersing it with recollections, wishful thoughts and self recorded videos. That said '127 Hours' excels at dramatizing the events visually. Cutting between character's point of view and close up of the expressions and then putting in some detailed slow motion shots, the camera work is simply mind blowing.To its credit, its portrayal of events has a 'thumbs up' from the real- life Aron Ralston! But, turning what could have been a great documentary on TV into intense drama on the big-screen marks Danny Boyle's achievement. AR Rahman's ominous music contributes to intensifying the drama. And, its editing has drawn applause too.Goodies apart, '127 Hours' may not be suitable for all audiences. A certain scene (not discussed here) without which the story wouldn't have been complete could be termed 'gory'. But if you think you can stomach it, this flick is not to be missed!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
its OK,"as a big film release of 2011 its impossible to go into this film not knowing the main plot points. thus there's an anticipation of what is about to happen. I'm not sure if this is to blame our if it is just that the film is just above mediocre but part way through I was urging the protagonist to just get on with it. "" we all know what you're gonna do, just hurry up about it."" was all i was thinking throughout the the last half of the movie.as with all Danny Boyle films it is beautifully shot with great music, but there is an absence of story. instead we are supposed to stay with the character through his pains and illusions. this proved to be the worst aspect of the film. the illusions seem to take over and seem to constitute the bulk of focus. that all being said the setting is wonderful and it is a different fare from most films. I'm just disappointed it never really sets its hooks in.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Ouch! My arm!,"Everyone who watches 127 Hours goes into the movie knowing that the guy cuts off his arm in the endbut what you might not expect is the wide spectrum of emotions and imagery that his journey to get there encompasses. The sense of discomfort waiting for *that* scene is palpable in an audience throughout the running time, but there's also the sense of discovery and life-affirming joy that the film's fantastic direction evokes.Danny Boyle brings the same kinetic energy to the material as he did with the likes of Trainspotting and Slumdog Millionaire - there's always been a confidence about his filmmaking that can either come off exhilarating or obnoxious, luckily here he strikes the former. From the opening scenes of Ralston setting off for his journey (without telling anyone where he's going I might add) Boyle employs split-screen visuals and a pumping tune to bring the audience along for the ride, as he takes with him only a few supplies and a handycam to record his trip to the desert near Moab, Utah.Franco's spirited portrayal of a thrill-seeking adventurer brings to mind the same carefree energy of Into the Wild's Christopher McCandless - another ill-fated young explorer, played by Emile Hirsch. Tearing through the desert on his bike, Ralston falls to the ground and without pausing snaps a shot of himself smiling on the ground. There are some really dynamic camera tricks, like placing the camera inside the straw as he takes a sip of water. He encounters two rather irritating girls, novice climbers for whom he serves as guide for an afternoon, taking a plunge into the rock pool with them and then going on his way.""We probably didn't even figure in his day"" the girls quip as he walks off. However, before too long Ralston is shouting their names from the fault line into which he has fallen. The moment the rock hits and he gets painfully wedged between it and the wall, bam - the title card ""127 Hours"" - a good 15 minutes into the film, a very sly move on Boyle's part. After much grunting and cursing, Ralston realises the severity of his situation, and so lays out his inventory - trying to formulate some kind of plan.He begins by trying to chip away at the rock with the blade of the cheap multi-tool he has with him. There is a moment early on when he drops the knife somewhere quite out of reach - and the audience, knowing what's coming, secretly hope that he can never pick it up. But alas, he does - and in fact attempts to sever his arm with the dull blade far earlier than you might expect, but to no avail.Ralston soon settles into a routine - recording his thoughts on the handycam every day - observing a raven that flies overhead each morning, the sunlight as it shines down into his fault line for fifteen minutes a day, and the few blissful moments he can bathe his ankle in it. Some music choices almost seem too upbeat and undercut the seriousness of the situation, Danny Boyle often (as he has in the past) places the need to keep an audience superficially entertained over the need to honour the grim reality of story.Ralston becomes resourceful in his fight for survival, constructing an elaborate pulley with ropes and connecting devices, trying with all his might to pull the rock out, but failing. On the Tuesday morning, he tapes himself hosting a kind of light-hearted TV chat show - interviewing himself about his current predicament. Entertaining as this enthusiastic schizo-dialogue might be, it stretches belief that he'd have so much energy after that many hours of dehydration.He begins to have dreams, remembering times with the French girl-that-got-away, played by the alluring Clémence Poésy, and also experiences hallucinations - including a rain shower that turns into flash flood - a spectacular sequence that sees Ralston floating to freedom as the rock comes loose in the rush of water, defying audience expectation before returning to him in his actual circumstance. Some of the flashbacks and illusions are a little heavy handed, as to be expected with Danny Boyle - but for the most part serve the movie well to take us out of the confined setting.As Ralston situation becomes more dire and he seems to be facing into death, his body is drained, becoming so dehydrated that he resorts to drinking his own urine, that same camera inside the straw now rising with a yellow liquid. ""It's no Slurpee"" Franco observes ""it's like a bag of p*ss"" Pushed to his physical and psychological limits, he makes the decision to sever his arm. He begins to have heart palpitations, and stabs himself in the arm out of frustration. Once again Boyle cuts to one of his novelty internal camera angle - this time we see the point of the blade hitting the bone. He begins breaking these bones, and it's out with the blade again - slitting skin, ripping tendons, blood everywhere - the soundtrack underscoring the pain.Despite how graphic the scene is, he's taking the necessary action to break free and it is truly a cathartic moment after so many scenes of struggle and hopelessness. Eventually, he emerges with only a red stump remaining - climbing out into the sunlight, having lost one arm - but gaining immeasurable wisdom from his experience. The struggle is over and has felt real thanks Franco's commitment to the character's plight and Danny Boyle's inventive direction. 127 Hours is an uncomfortable ride, but one worth taking, as long as you're not too squeamish.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

INSPIRING,"127 hours is a powerful reminder that the human spirit can overcome challenges.Its a must see movie for anyone looking for a dose of insight.""127 Hours is a cinematic masterpiece that will leave you breathless, inspired, and emotionally drained. James Franco's powerful portrayal of Aron Ralston, the mountain climber who became trapped in a canyon for 127 hours, is a tour-de-force performance that will haunt you long after the credits roll.The film's inspiring true story is a testament to the human spirit's capacity for resilience, hope, and determination. Ralston's ordeal is a harrowing reminder of the power of nature and the importance of living in the moment. As we watch him struggle to free himself from the canyon, we're forced to confront our own mortality and the fragility of life.But 127 Hours is more than just an inspiring true story - it's also a cinematic achievement that will leave you gasping in awe. Director Danny Boyle's innovative camera work and clever use of flashbacks and hallucinations create a dreamlike atmosphere that perfectly captures the surreal quality of Ralston's experience.The film's emotional depth is also noteworthy, particularly in the scenes where Ralston reflects on his past and the people he loves. These moments are poignant and deeply moving, and they add a richness and complexity to the film that makes it feel more nuanced and satisfying.Overall, 127 Hours is a must-see film that will inspire, educate, and entertain you. It's a powerful reminder of the human spirit's capacity for resilience and hope, and it's a testament to the enduring power of cinema to move, inspire, and transform us.""",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

When being caught between a rock and a hard place becomes all too real,"Few movies provide as purely visceral an experience as ""127 Hours,"" a gripping true-life account of a man who literally gives his right arm to save his life.It was April 2003 when daredevil outdoorsman and experienced rock climber Aron Walston ventured alone into Blue John Canyon in Utah without telling anybody where he was going. Tragedy struck when a giant boulder came crashing down on him, smashing and pinning his right arm so that Walston was actually left dangling a few feet above the ground. After more than five days in this position, he made the horrific decision to cut off the arm, thereby free himself from his predicament.Given the shockingly gruesome nature of the material, it's possible that many people avoided watching this movie when it played in theaters. One of the advantages of seeing the movie on DVD is that the faint of heart can fast-forward through the more unsettling parts and not miss out on the overall experience – or James Franco's dazzling and empathic tour-de-force performance.Moments of lucidity alternate with moments of intense unreality and confusion as the hours tick off and Walston increasingly struggles against hunger, thirst, cold, pain and mounting desperation. What strikes one most about Walston is the amazing resourcefulness and calm demeanor he demonstrates while confronting a situation most of us can imagine only in our worst nightmares. Walston certainly has time to think back over his life and to consider what exactly brought him to this moment in time and to contemplate the people who've made the deepest impact on him, and how he's treated - and, in some cases, mistreated - them throughout the course of his life.Walston's ordeal resonates with viewers in that it shows us just how vulnerable we are to the cruel exigencies of an indifferent Nature, and how one little mistake or simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time can forever seal our fate.Director Danny Boyle and co-writer Simon Beaufry keep things from becoming unduly claustrophobic by throwing hallucinations, memories and imaginings into the narrative mix and by freely indulging in the hyperkinetic montage sequences that have long been the hallmark of Boyle's style (see ""Trainspotting"" and ""Slumdog Millionaire"").In terms of acting, this is pretty much a one-man show, but there are important contributions from Amber Tamblyn, Kate Mara and Treat Williams in small but significant roles.Hard as it may be to sit through at times, ""127 Hours"" provides us with an unforgettable and ultimately inspiring portrait of a man staring into the face of Death – and making Death blink.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another Danny Boyle masterpiece?,"127 Hours is Danny Boyles follow up to the huge commercial and critical success of Slumdog Millionaire.I normally like to see a movie without knowing too much details about the plot and especially the ending. 127 Hours is based on a true story of Aron who gets trapped in a cave after a rock falls on his arm and becomes lodged. Although not familiar with the story I had heard details about what happened which did spoil my enjoyment of the film. I will not repeat the ending for those people that don't know, but i suspect the majority of movie goers will know what's coming.Whilst trapped Aron creates a video diary of what he expect to be his last few days of life. During this time he has flash backs and dreams of his life. I couldn't help thinking that this could have been more interesting.James Franco is obviously the large focus of the film and he does a pretty good job as Aron. With the exception of the opening and closing credit sequence Danny Boyle is also good although I don't think it ever reaches the heights of Slumdog.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Rock around the clock,"'Touching the Void' and 'Between a Rock and a Hard Place' are two of the great stories of wilderness adventures gone wrong. But whereas the former was always going to make a great film, the latter (the inspiration for '127 hours') is more problematic, because of the static nature of the tale (basically, a man gets trapped beneath a rock). However, the Utah scenery is gorgeous, James Franco is note perfect as the initially rather arrogant young man who has the courage not to die, and director Danny Boyle, whose films I don't always admire, makes a good fist at finding cinematic ways to chart his protagonist's increasingly desperate state of mind. Almost inevitably, though, as a film about being stuck, it drags a little, before it's amazing, horrific yet wonderful end.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
There is not enough stars for this.,This film based on true story was filmed Danny Boyle the guy who gave us Trainspotting and 28 Days Later.

One of the best movies based on a true story.,"Some spoilers might have slipped through, so brace yourself warned!""127 Hours"" is based on the true story of Aron Ralston. Aron is an engineer, who's passion lays more in adventure. So one day he decides that he wants to go, and have some fun in Moab, Utah. But he does this without telling anyone about it, so when his arm get's stuck between a rock and a wall, panic starts to flow..This movie was directed by Danny Boyle. This is also the person who wrote the screenplay for the movie, I love when directors also write the screenplay, this shows their dedication to the movie (in most cases), but more on the screenplay later. He has one multiple movies, and this is the first one that I've seen of him, so I can't really compare with his previous films. In this movie he utilizes a very cool and refreshing style. The three way screen (I think you'll understand what I mean if you've seen the movie), was at first a bit weird, and I didn't quite like it. But as the movie progressed, I started to enjoy and appreciate it more. This can be seen throughout the movie, but the longer parts are in the beginning, and at the end of the movie. I also liked that he used the footage of the camera of Aron. He was also creative at times; by making it look like there was a camera in the tube of his drinking bag. This gave a cool effect. The cinematography was also done very well. This was gorgeous to look at. This was done by two people Enrique Chediak and Anthony Dod Mantle. The make-up was really good. Which leads me to one of my favorite scenes of the movie. The scene where he cuts of his own arm. I very much enjoyed this part because of the brilliant way it was directed and acted. You could really see the pain, anger and fear in James Fronco's eyes. The wounds looked real, a bit to real as well. But due to the rapid editing you get spared a bit. In most cases I would hate a fast edited part, but here I felt blessed for it :). The cgi was a bit of a downside for me. The bird that flies over looked very cg, just like the upcoming clouds. But the water-bag cgi looked good to me, if it even was cgi.The acting was good, and this is an average, because James Franco was amazing, and the rest, not so much. Not that they were bad, but there weren't great either. So let's start of with the main character. Aron, played by James Franco. In this review I've already said multiple times that he was fantastic, because he was. He showed his acting qualities numerous times during the movie, mostly during the emotional parts. It's just so fascinating that he can convince me so good that he is in pain. Sadly he hasn't really picked good movies recently. There aren't a lot of actors in ""127 Hours"", so I'll just discus Kate Mara, and Amber Tamblyn. First, Kate Mara. She is overall a good actress, just one of her latest movies is not a good one *cough* Fant4Stick *cough*. But she has redeemed herself in ""The Martian"". In this movie she plays Kristi, a girl who is walking in the same place with her friend as Aron. Aron meets them, and befriends them. She was fine. Not her greatest role, but also not her worst. Her friend was played by Amber Tamblyn, and she was fine too. On the rest of the supporting cast I can't judge, because I've seen so little of them.The screenplay is, like I've said, written by the director, Danny Boyle, but also by Simon Beaufoy. The screenplay was very well written. Even though there wasn't a lot of dialogue, they kept me interested and invested with the film. This of course isn't only because of the script, but because of the directing as well. The dialogue, as far as there was some, was good. A thing that some people might find stupid, is that you can see that they are struggling to reach the ninety minute mark. They use lot's of flashbacks, and thoughts, that stretch out the duration of the movie. In some circumstances I didn't mind them. For example the thought of Aron that it started to rain. This just showed how desperate he was to survive, but also heartbroken, near the end. Just that scene alone describes his feelings during the movie. The characters weren't that great developed. Aron kind of was, but it just didn't make me care more about him. The supporting cast wasn't worth to developed, so I didn't care about that they didn't do it. What they do manage to do is to create a starting feeling with Aron. Due to the charisma of James Franco.That was my review for an emotional movie, with very good directing, and a fantastic main actor.8.7/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very good,"Before watching it, the question that obviously comes to mind is: ""How is Boyle going to build a whole movie about this ""static"" story ?"".Well, he did more than well actually, juggling perfectly with the emotions that drive Aron, you really feel empathy for him throughout the film and that's what was captivating in my opinion, even though you already knew the story and the ending. Some of the flashbacks were meaningless though, it felt like padding to make it more dynamic and interesting.James Franco's performance is outstanding, same goes for Boyle's cinematography, the soundtrack and the sound recording.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Effectively simple,"How could a director like Danny Boyle hope to make a film about a man who spent five days with his arm trapped under a rock?This is the question I asked myself when I first heard of '127 Hours', and I asked it again (this time with even greater bewilderment) when I saw how well-received it was. I had numerous opportunities to watch this film over the past six-to-seven years, but I could never convince myself that I'd enjoy it. Then, with little else to watch, I decided to give it a chance. My only regret is that I hadn't given it this chance back in 2010.There are no surprises to '127 Hours' - no twists, narrative intricacies or other film-making favourites. The expression 'What you see it what you get' applies to this film more than almost any other. In spite of that (or *because* of that, perhaps), '127 Hours' is an exhilarating experience.James Franco leads the film, joining a small but competent team of supporting actors. I was recently impressed by Franco's acting in the mini-series '11.22.63', but now consider '127 Hours' to be his greatest performance. He captures both the resilience and desperation of his role excellently, and I doubt that a lesser performer could have handled the lead in a film like this.The visuals are by necessity rather simple, but there are one or two quite memorable scenes, largely due to the sharp camera-work. The editing in the opening and concluding scenes is also commendable.I don't consider this to be the greatest Danny Boyle film, but it's certainly of an expected quality for those familiar with titles like 'Trainspotting'.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

127,"I have enjoyed Danny Boyle's work, though I found myself let down by Sunshine, so naturally I was all for seeing 127 Hours. I thought it was excellent and very interestingly done. I think the movie could have been a tad longer, but that in mind, 127 Hours is a superb-looking movie, definitely one of the best-looking and impressive movies of 2010 in my eyes. I just loved the wonderful cinematography and landscapes and also the kinetic editing and visual effects. The story is compelling and well paced, beautifully put together by well staged and thoughtfully thought out flashbacks and hallucinations. The music is fitting and dynamic, the conclusion is harrowing and I think heart-wrenching and a lot of effort is taken into making the audience empathise with Ralston. Other than the technical aspects, what really stood out about 127 Hours was Boyle's superb direction, it is wonderfully tight throughout, and the mesmerising tour-de-force that is James Franco's lead performance. All in all, excellent. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"well, guess what ?","Knowing the story behind this film as it was reported at the time i was looking forward to an earth moving film experience....how disappointing. Starting with a sound track designed to rattle windows on Mars and an introduction which, far from exciting my anticipation, had me wondering if i was in the middle of another film altogether. It must have been difficult to make this film stand up with such a limited story line,resultingly there is continual 'padding-out' which certainly drained my interest. Not very often i find myself nodding off in the middle and looking at my watch. Slumber was however difficult with the music beating heck out of my eardrums. The flash backs really were a nonsense, i mean,was the director trying to force me to tears. ( He failed on that score ) By comparison ' Touching The Void ',a similar theme, was much more successful. Trying to sum up as the credits scrolled down at the end, i came to the conclusion that this was some sort of rock/pop music suite which used the moving image as an accompanying instrument. OK, it had it's moments but for me it would have needed both arms trapped by that boulder to make it watchable.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

I couldn't help but fall for his character right away, just like the likable Aron Ralston did years before when I first saw his story while working in the news television history.I couldn't help but try to compare his performance with Tom Hank's in Cast Away. Could just watching this guy stock under a rock for 90 minutes hold my attention? Well, this movie was a bit different. There were flashbacks and other movie trickery used to fill time and get us into the mind of Ralston instead of just letting Franco let us in through his performance. But I don't want to take away from Franco's great job.The heart behind the movie is something real and you can't help but be moved by his courage and will to live.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

What an exhausting ride!,"Thanks to the incredible directing from Danny Boyle that played with our emotions, and James Franco's powerful performance, 127 Hours is one of the most intense movies I've ever watched!We know everything about Aron Ralston from the flashback scenes, maybe this is the best use of flashback technique in film if not flawless one; as some of flashback scenes felt like the were forced to the movie or they were used just to waste some time. Also, some of daydream scenes changed the tone of the movie.(8.5/10)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Impressive movie-making from Danny Boyle,"""127 Hours"" is Danny Boyle's follow-up to the highly acclaimed ""Slumdog Millionaire"". For it, he assembled a crew that included ""Slumdog"" Oscar winners Simon Beaufoy (screenwriter) and A.R. Rahman (composer). The film garnered six richly deserved Oscar nominations but unfortunately failed to win any.The true story concerns mountain climber Aron Ralston who becomes trapped in an isolated canyon in Utah. With his arm pinned under a heavy boulder his outlook is bleak but he courageously refuses to give up. About three quarters of the film takes place stuck in one spot but Boyle & Beaufoy keep the action interesting by incorporating flashback and dream sequences.The film is practically a one man show with James Franco tackling the Ralston role. It's a demanding role and one that sees Franco deliver on the promise that he showed years ago. He would have been a deserving Oscar winner but faced tough competition from Colin Firth. Besides Franco there are a handful of other notables in small roles, all of whom contribute solid performances.Boyle's direction is superb and nothing if not Oscar worthy. Like Franco, Boyle was presented with a tough task and rose to the challenge. Credit should also be given to co-screenwriter Simon Beaufoy and editor Jon Harris for keeping the narrative flowing. Then there's the stellar music by A.R. Rahman blending canny soundtrack choices and mood-enhancing original music. All were rewarded with Oscar nominations but lost out to ""The Social Network"". Meanwhile, the dazzling cinematography of Enrique Chediak & Anthony Dod Mantle was undeservedly snubbed by the Academy.All in all, ""127 Hours"" is a highly compelling film graced with superlative production values and a top-notch lead performance. The only drawback is that the film's conclusion is never in doubt, seeing as how the movie is based on an autobiography. Hardly a fault of the filmmakers' but it's a testament to their skill that the movie is so gripping in spite of the outcome being known beforehand.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's amazing what goes through your head when you can't feel your arm.,"127 Hours is a shockingly true story about Aron Ralston (Franco) who ventures out to the Blue John Canyon without telling anyone his whereabouts. The unthinkable happens when he falls down a canyon and his arm become pinned by a boulder. He is trapped down there for five days struggling to survive going through some desperate measures one should never have to contemplate.I've heard many say 127 is stupid, and just a boring film. They obviously have no appreciation for great scenery and a very involved soundtrack. The film is scored by Slumdog Millionaire's A.R. Rahman. Rahman is perhaps most famous from his song Jai Ho, which is a great motivating song. He scores this movie to perfection and intensity.In a way I have sympathy for Ralston, and I don't. You're not the brightest of bulbs if you go out to a canyon and bring or tell no one. I wouldn't go within a hundred feet of a canyon or mountain. I damn sure wouldn't do it alone. But Ralston begins to become delusional and hallucinate about past relationship and his family members. He realizes he never appreciated life or anything in it. He does the unthinkable and amputates his harm with a dull pocket-knife.The amputation scene was not what I expected. I expected it to be extremely gory, gruesome, and disgustingly unwatchable. It was pretty graphic, but not as graphic as I had hoped. It hardly made me cringe. Still very well done effect wise, just not as good as it's hype.James Franco deserved the Best Actor Oscar most definitely. I haven't seen The King's Speech, but Collin Firth must've truly been something to beat Franco to the Oscar. He might not be Oscar material as a host, but he sure was it as an actor.Is 127 Hours an autobiography? A documentary? A drama? Or maybe a ""docudrama."" It is an up close, in your face look at fear and hopelessness, and the closest thing you will get to that painful five days. It's almost like a documentary within a drama film. Something I've rarely seen. Further shows why Boyle's 127 Hours is a masterpiece on film.Starring: James Franco. Directed by: Danny Boyle.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Based on the true story of Aron Ralston, the film plunges viewers into the depths of despair as Ralston finds himself trapped by a fallen boulder in a remote Utah canyon.What sets ""127 Hours"" apart is its unflinching portrayal of isolation and the psychological toll it takes on its protagonist.

This movie saved me.,"There aren't enough words to describe how special 127 Hours is to me. It has saved me from depression and suicidal thoughts. Aron's story is amazing, and so is this movie. Everything about it is great. James Franco's performance in particular, steals the show. It's amazing how perfect he was. His range of emotions he portrayed are spectacular. There wasn't one bit where his performance was not believable. Danny Boyle's direction is excellent too. To me, no other could've pulled off this movie as good as he did. A.R. Rahman's score is perfect for this movie as well. I can literally go on and on about how good 127 Hours is.If there's one movie I'd recommend you to see, it's this one. I'm forever grateful I came across this movie. It's so powerful and inspiring.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of 2010's best films.,"127 HOURS opens with masses of people cut back and forth, and it makes a good point - all of us together make a society and a cooperation, and later as we find Aron (James Franco) stuck alone in the desert we come face to face with a human being's sole survival. Director Danny Boyle challenges himself with this intimate drama based on the true story of Aron Ralston, who while canyoneering in remote Utah fell into a mountain crack and got his hand stuck under a boulder. It's an exhilarating film right from the outset, and as soon as we're stuck with Aron the film starts pushing limits and ideas with incredible pizazz. James Franco makes arguably this year's best performance, his shared thoughts, pleasures and fears goes through a wallop as he dreams about being flooded out of his situation, or reminiscing his former girlfriend or family memories. 127 Hours is a thrilling adventure that becomes a touching story, and as the rousing climax comes it feels beautifully.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Filled With Emotion from Beginning to End,"I've been a constant aficionado of Danny Boyle's work, and this film is one of best quite honestly. I came in expecting a simple tale of survival, but instead I found myself completely entranced by the story telling. Great visuals help to put you there in between the crevice walls and really make you experience the toll of the situation. The director and actor work together to portray a wide range of emotions and despite what you'd think the film never seems slow. Boyle even manages to achieve many moments of surrealism within it all. Imagine the terrifying and dark premise, and yet there are nicely done moments of comedy that fit in quite nicely. Of course, a large part of the film's effectiveness is the casting of James Franco. Words can't describe how awesome he was from start to finish. As an added bonus, it's one of those rare treats that for the most part lives up to its true-story basis. I highly recommend the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unbelievabl!!!,The incredible true story of mountaineer Aron Lee Ralston.Truly his mental strength was unmatchable.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Incredibly padded and vastly overrated,"How on earth did this movie get nominated for six Oscars, especially Best Picture, Best Leading Actor and Best Adapted Screenplay? Pretty dull, once Ralston is trapped in the canyon. Before then, it was OK. Unfortunately the canyon scene consumes more than half the movie, and is mostly just padding.James Franco's Oscar nomination is incredibly perplexing. He spends most of the movie in one spot, staring vacantly. Considering his acting, er, ""ability"", probably the only Oscar nomination he will get, so we'll let him have his moment of glory, I guess.Would have been OK as a 45-minute TV documentary-drama. A 93-minute cinema movie - you've got to be kidding.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
127 Hours Wasn't Long Enough,"Brilliant!!!! I'm a fan of James Franco so maybe I could be a little biased but he made this movie. I really believed he was down there trapped in that canyon just like the original Aron Ralston. I also felt like I was right there rooting for him to make it out; right there feeling his pain as that last drop of water dried up and he had to resort to drastic measures; right there during those vivid hallucinations; right there when he made that ""good bye"" video to his family thinking ""this is it!"".Director Danny Boyle did a great job adapting Ralston's near death experience to the big screen; the movie itself based on the New York Times bestseller autobiography, Between a Rock and a Hard Place. Considering a great deal of this movie features only one character, Boyle (along with Simon Beaufoy) worked wonders with the screenplay. As you can imagine, special effects were almost non-existent. I think the only time we saw special effects were during Ralston's brief hallucination spells. The lack of special effects made the film all the more real, and realness is something seriously missing from modern films. Make-up also was on point as at times during the ordeal Franco (as Ralston) looked like the walking dead.There are other actors, and a touching cameo of Ralston and his family at the end, but this movie is all Franco.If you are a fan of survival movies, then you have to see this.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Agony and Ecstasy of 127 HOURS,"Based on the harrowing tale of survival by Aron Ralston and adapted by Simon Beaufoy and director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later), 127 Hours challenges the viewer to share in a difficult, life changing event that most people could never contemplate. It's quite a feat to engage and emotionally move an audience focused solely on one person in one place. For an actor to pull this off is a great testament to James Franco's acting skills and physical prowess as well as Boyle's ingenuity behind the camera.In April, 2003, Aron Ralston (Franco) escapes the rat race of the city to go hiking in a remote terrain. After parking his car, he goes mountain biking and then by foot deeper into isolation. There, he comes upon two hikers, Megan and Kristi, who are a bit lost. He tells them that the earth with its rocks and mountains is always moving. How prophetic! Aron guides the women and puts them on the right track after a brief adventure in a cave and a sparkling pool of water. Later, he proceeds on his trek of solitude and, while climbing between a narrow ravine, slips, and as he falls, a large bolder tumbles and pins his arm against the wall. Trying everything possible to dislodge the rock, he finds he is hopelessly trapped with limited supplies. No one knows where he is because he was didn't care enough to mention it to family or friends. He is a confident, even cocky explorer whose cavalier attitude changes through this ordeal. He displays some amazing resourcefulness in such moments as when he erects a mini tent to protect his head from the elements. As he waits in vain for help that is not coming, he contemplates his survival skills and evaluates his life and relationships. Life is precious, and he must do whatever he can to survive even if it means the unthinkable.The entire film works despite the fact it centers exclusively on one actor. (The Spirit of St. Louis is another that comes to mind.) Franco accomplishes the difficult task by making us care for an arrogant, free spirit who knows no fear. The film focuses on minute details that could easily be glossed over. The simplest of acts become a tortuous struggle as when his pocket knife falls and he must retrieve it while still pinned. A drink of water from his ever shrinking supply becomes an agonizing death watch. The flashback scenes give us some background into his family life and a former girlfriend. He even fantasizes a vision of a boy, a son that he will perhaps have someday? He regrets the things left undone or unsaid and resolves to make changes in his life if he makes it out alive. The fact that we know the outcome does not at all diminish the agony we feel for him in close quarters and his determination to survive. In a way the big rock is a kind of metaphor for his life. What should be a liberating journey becomes a test of survival, and as the hours go by and one day bleeds into the next, we become a part of his limited world complete with cracks of sunlight and an occasional bird or insect. After awhile you wonder if we really see images he is seeing, or if it is nothing more than a mirage or hallucination. During his ordeal he uses his mini video camera to document his plight and to report on his situation and feelings. The camera becomes a sort of confessor for him.Yes, the scene where he must separate himself from the rock is excruciating but never exploitive. The subsequent scenes where he makes his way back to civilization and encounters other hikers are powerfully heart wrenching yet life affirming. It packs a punch and wrings you emotionally as Franco finds salvation when all hope is seemingly lost. By film's end we breathe a collective sigh of relief. Yet it is the cumulative effect of emotions and our shared experience with him that are truly affecting.Boyle utilizes hand-held cameras and crisp editing to keep things moving along in a methodically paced narrative. It is ironic at how the beautiful landscape is in sharp contrast to the horror that Aron must experience. The film may set a record for having the longest running time before displaying its first title card. There is a nice epilogue which alludes to his prophetic visions from before. This is not a morbid exercise in claustrophobia or grossness but rather a realistic recreation of the triumph of the human spirit against impossible odds and the bleakest of settings.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Cinematic Gold!,"127 Hours is a little film that I would call cinematic gold. This is a gut-wrenching film that requires very little actors and great directing. Danny Boyle's film is another film that shows why 2010 was one of the greatest year for films ever. 127 Hours will definitely play with emotions effectively.

His portrayal as the confident, know-it-all Aron was emotional and heart-wrenching.Overall, this is a powerful film that is a great example of telling a story about humans doing what they can to survive.

hail to James Franco and Danny Boyle,"I don't have to introduce Danny Boyle. His flicks always had some kind of twist, just look at Trainspotting or 28 Days Later. His new much acclaimed flick ""127 hours"" already did his work in the US. Today it was premiered over here and the newspapers and tabloids did their , free promo, home work. People getting sick by watching it or just leaving the theater because they can't take it anymore. That's okay but that kind of reactions made me became precautionary. Sometimes the reactions from the US are over the top...But I can admit, if you have a weak stomach then I understand that you could become sick. I won't go into any details but there is indeed a very gory part. If you are a horror buff than you will have no problem with it but for non-horror watchers it will be a hard pill to swallow. After 15 minutes into the film Aron Ralston (excellent played by James Franco) get's stuck in the canyon. From that point on it's just him you are watching. Flashbacks, hallucinations, it all passes by. But the editing and the choice of music did his work to, when 'A Lovely Day (Bill Withers)' starts it just gave another dimension to this number. And the use of Sigur Ros, which I normally doesn't like did his work too. A must see and surely an Oscar worthy.

Between a Rock and a Hard Place,"The first thing I have to mention, and I'm certainly not the first, is the incredible performance by James Franco. His role as Aron is gut-wrenching and charged with emotion. The various hallucinations and struggles he goes through more than convinced me that the real Aron went through the same torment. Which brings up a good question. What does it take for James Franco to get an Oscar? I asked the same thing of Mark Wahlberg in THE FIGHTER. I know there can only be one Best Actor, but WHAT. DOES. IT. TAKE? Both are talented, who infuse their roles with convincing emotions. When both actors are going through struggles, you feel it and cheer them on when they succeed. And both have played roles that are so natural and down-to-earth (with the exception of Max Payne in Wahlberg's case, but let's forgive him for that.) Second, the cinematography is astounding. Considering that most of the running time takes place with Aron trapped in the crevice, Danny Boyle and his team are at it again! Filming their scenes in dozens of new and creative ways. The best scenes I felt were the hallucinations. They were spot-on without feeling staged or fakey. There is one in particular that makes you think the movie's over, until you realize along with Aron that it's all a fantasy. Of late, I've been really impressed with Danny Boyle's work. TRAINSPOTTING was a force to be reckoned with, 28 DAYS LATER redefined the zombie genre, SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE was an inspiring journey into a part of India that we rarely see outside of Indian cinema, and now 127 HOURS has us diving into the world of extreme sports (along with the perils of living life on the edge.) I highly recommend this to anyone who wants an inspiring story, with a word of caution if you're squeamish about realistic gore effects.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Danny Boyle's intense, thought-provoking account on the true story of a man's survival is not just outstanding, but simply spellbinding to its core","One thing 2008's Oscar Winner 'Slumdog Millionaire' proved is that Danny Boyle is a man with a directorial gift pounding with a force to reckoned with. And that only makes up a majority of the reason of why the English director makes a marvelous choice to take the fascinating true story of Aron Ralston and energize it to life with electrifying precision. The story of Aron Ralston, a man who in 2003, faced an unfortunate situation during his exploration in a beautiful sunny desert that left him crippled from the world before making a difficult decision that most people would think, perhaps more times, about doing. The man's story of survival is brought to the screen with such powerful energy and a magnetic performance by lead James Franco it isn't too far below what could almost be considered a masterpiece. While that may be saying a lot, it is only an expression how admirable Boyle and Franco prove to make a good team when honoring the survival of a man who fought against near impossible odds. Set in 2003, James Franco plays Ralston, a man living in southern Utah who takes a hiking trip in the Blue John Canyon. Exploring the wonders of the land and running into two women (played by Kate Mara and Amber Tamblyn) who he goes for a swim with before departing, his trip starts off as a dream come true. That is until he takes a nasty spill down a canyon followed a boulder that pins his arm against the wall. Trapped with his arm completely incapacitated and unable to move to the boulder even an inch, Ralston must do everything he can to survive.As the titles claims, the subject character is trapped for an astonishing amount of time, and the cruel assault to injury is that he has no food or water and is forced to resort to drinking his urine. Danny Boyle brings the harrowing account of the poor man's desperate survival to vigorous authenticity, and does so without resorting to exploitative territory. Boyle boasts extraordinary effort to inject liveliness and subtly into the central figure's fight for survival, while appointing James Franco with the daring task of carrying the film on his shoulders. To remarkable effort, Franco proves tremendous in this task, electrifying his role with both energy and soul, particularly in the more emotional-driven bits where he reminises about his family. Collaborating with Boyle once again is Anthony Dod Mantle who boasts absorbing camera work to tightly capture the claustrophobic atmosphere of Aron Ralston's severely cramped environment, and not before soaring the camera around the desert to capture the warming beauty of the Blue John Canyon. And when the film eventually stations its focus on Ralston suffering his unpleasant predicament, every grueling detail of his misery is powerfully apprehended on both visual and emotional scope. This feat also brings out the nightmare feasting on audiences' eyes during the incredibly gruesome finale when Ralston makes an almost unimaginable decision, and if you are familiar with the story, you know how it ends; and the only strongest of stomach would be in the safest capacity to withstand the brutality of this scene. Again, the deeper the film travels into detail, the more riveting it gets as it paints an unforgettable picture of a man who's will to survive outwitted the pain he endures.127 Hours is an intense, riveting, and an astoundingly thought- provoking testament on its true-story-based subject. It is a fascinating account on its central figure, carrying an amazing amount of gravity and liveliness only Danny Boyle is capable of establishing. While not the most uplifting picture, it is one that many can deeply admire, especially with the appeal of James Franco at hand.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Boring trash.,"An idiot falls in between 2 clifs, survive 127days, cut his arm, escape. End of story.What a waste of my time. Making a movie about an arrogant a-hole going off on his own to become an even bigger a-hole. How about a movie that doesn't try to convince me of this. Too many fictional events added to make the story more titillating.Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't want to have to go through what Aron did, however I am not such an egomaniac to allow myself to be in that situation. As an avid climber and mountaineer, I first learned to never go off on your own. I cannot believe I wasted two hours of my life watching this drivel.I do not understand those of you who say you've walked away with a deeper understanding of life, felt inspired or have emotional clarity from this movie.

Well spent hours,"First rate and frank story telling about that real life incident, which left a young cave explorer, forced to make a decision, which involved severing one of his arms, wedged between a rock and a hard place. Of course, relying on Franco to steer it, like Hanks in Castaway, again he doesn't disappoint and we're right there with him, feeling the frustration and anger, waiting out those long hours in unforgiving heat. Some beautiful photography, that lake inside that cave, made me jump into it. This is a drama, that makes you appreciate what you can lose, on taking off, and what can result from the irresponsibility of not informing someone of your wherabouts. But when you're gotta go, you gotta go. Franco makes his very natural and human performance, watchable. The end music score of triumph, and hope is fantastic. As though it doesn't really come off as main stream cinema, as a little trite, it's really the movie's message of the human spirit, which is it's main objective.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"96,360 hours","11 years is a long time to wait to write a review. In my defense, though, I didn't get around to seeing it unless 11 years after its release.This movie should be required viewing for sons who ignore their fathers' advice to hike with another person or in a group, and to let people know where they are going and when they plan to be back. I am thinking particularly of sons with 4-letter names like Cody or Noah.It is a true story about a canyoner who spends several days by himself trying to survive in one of the narrow crevices in the earth just outside of Canyonlands, Utah.My only criticism is that it lacked character development or insight. A little more background, perhaps at the beginning, might have been good.Still worth seeing, though, even if only for the cinematography.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Survival,This is an interesting movie which is a must watch. There is nothing I did not like from the film. The main actor Aron played his role very well and this made the movie to be so great. Although it brought some emotions when the actor was trapped into the rock he had to implement different techniques in order to survive. The other good thing about this movie is that you can watch it with your family as it will inspire each and everyone in the event that you got stuck in the middle of nowhere you can't just give up but you get up and start fighting for survival. Those who haven't watched it should try it.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Never travel without letting someone know.,"Given the terrifying nature of Aron Ralston's ordeal, the movie was surprisingly low key. Perhaps this was due to the fact of Mr. Ralston's recklessness which led to his mishaps or maybe the sheer senselessness of what he was doing, which seemed to be pointless, self-indulgent, and never explained in the movie. After all, nobody told him to go hiking in the middle of nowhere. Yet that is what he did, and for that he almost lost his life, which is the crux of the story. How he saves himself is amazing. Yet the moment when he finally does free himself seems almost anticlimactic, when it should have been the climax of the movie. To self-amputate a part of one's body is an act of sheer desperation that is horrifying. Although one can root for Mr. Ralston to persevere and to be saved, what cannot be ignored is the sheer recklessness of his behavior that got in that predicament in the first place. Everyone can appreciate his dilemma but it's a dilemma that he brought upon himself, which gives one cause to wonder: Why? James Franco's performance is outstanding.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A lesson in editing and defying the odds,"Being nominated for six Oscars including for Best Motion Picture of the Year and Best Achievement in Film Editing (which it deserved to win) is a huge honour and one which '127 Hours' by the one and only Danny Boyle totally deserves.Based on the true story by Aron Ralston, this film is a lesson in editing among many other things such as the endurance of the human spirit, even against all odds. Aron's story is as horrific as it is inspiring, we just wish we could face such grim consequences he found himself in as courageously and as intelligently as he did!It is a shame that this film did not win any Oscars as it deserved to win at least one of the categories in my opinion.

Check what else is on...,"Although the film had some good things going for it: the human experience of surviving harrowing conditions; the thought processes one must go through in those circumstances, it's mostly unbearable, both for its length and the sense of claustrophobia. Furthermore it really seems as though film wasn't the right medium for this true story, as it severely limits what you can do in terms of plot and drama.On the matter of music, it seems to want to make up for a lack of action at times, and it's rather obtrusive when coupled with those fast camera shots (I didn't enjoy the opening).Furthermore, the dreams and hallucinations seemed more like filler.So I wouldn't recommend this one (unless you can tolerate watching pain, and don't mind the constraints of a fairly linear storyline, and the irritating use of music).",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
I love a good film - This is one of them,"This had the same type feel as Sean Penn's 'Into The Wild'. Maybe it was the fact that this was also about a wanderlust.

However, I thought it was a great piece of story telling, and very much had me trapped during the duration wondering what if that was me, what the hell would I do. I will not spoil, but I will say I'm not scream-ish, but in one scene I was tested. James Franco played the part very well, and I loved the character he portrayed. I've been through the Nevada desert before and this movie makes me want to go back again and travel that bit further, to a certain extent though.

Unreal lust for life,"Do you live thinking everything is fine, that it will just ""pass""? Or perhaps you are merely existing, and every morning you are scared of what is happening to you? Have you ever felt despair? Are you stuck at a dead end, not knowing where to go? Have you become indifferent, like an empty shell, unable to feel anything? Or are you overly confident and carefree? If you answered ""yes"" to even one of these questions - stop everything, turn on the movie 127 Hours, take a deep breath, exhale, and allow yourself to immerse in this incredible work of art. This is not just a film - it is a lesson I may never forget.At its core, this film is about the incredible power of the human will, the relentless will to live, boundless optimism, and the fight, above all, with oneself, with one's own fears. Don't waste any more time thinking - watch it, because you've never seen anything like it. Goosebumps will follow you throughout the entire film, and the lump in your throat will grow heavier with every passing moment, because what happens on screen touches everyone who watches it, deeply and completely.After watching, I saw James Franco in a completely new light. His portrayal of Aron shook me to my core. It is impossible not to be amazed at how he inhabited the role, how he recreated those five days of hell in his ""open prison"" from which there seemed to be no escape. How he fought, never gave up, joked, delivered monologues to avoid losing his mind, how he experienced fainting and despair, how he sent a message to his family, how he interacted with the girls in the canyon. Every moment of his performance was breathtaking. It was truly flawless talent, which carried the entire film, supported by the incredible work with close-ups, where every detail matters. For me, this film is undoubtedly the pinnacle of his career.I would also like to express my deep respect and gratitude to the director Danny Boyle for this masterpiece, for the stunning adaptation of the autobiography of rock climber Aron Ralston, for the quality of the shooting, editing, music, and all the work that went into it. My sincere applause!After watching this film, you will feel the urge to step outside, take a deep breath, and start truly living.

Human Will Survive..,"One of the most inspirational survival movies I've ever seen! 127 Hours is based on the amazing true story of Aron Ralston, a canyoneer who was trapped alone for almost five days in a canyon and finally made it out alive. The movie not only depicts this horrifying experience in detail but also gives it a spiritual depth by relating it to Ralston's life. Although the movie lacks action, there is no way you can feel bored; Boyle manages to make the situation that Ralston (James Franco) finds himself in so intimate that it will totally consume you. It will amaze you how far the human will could be pushed and challenged. As for James Franco, honestly I've never liked him but I have to admit his performance was amazing and one of his best so far. Now 127 Hours is certainly my favorite Danny Boyle movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Making a mountain out of a mole hill, Boyle's masterpiece.","One fateful day in the canyons of Utah a lone climber fell into the worst predicament he could have imagined. In April of 2003 Aron Ralston found out what he was made of, literally and figuratively. While Aron was trekking the rocky terrain of ""Blue John Canyon"" his luck ran out and fell due to a loose boulder which crushed and trapped his arm against the rock wall. His story is one of hope, triumph, terror and sheer determination. The perfect setting for an intensely satisfying movie experience. Thankfully, director Danny Boyle delivered this in spades.""127 Hours"" is a full feature film about this tragic but conquering incident. Aron Ralston, an avid climber and hiker, played by the talented James Franco, made the near fatal mistake of not telling anyone where he was going. Ralston sets out to his ""home away from home"" and meets a couple of less experienced hikers looking for some adventure. He takes them to a beautiful spot where they enjoy a brief swim, though this section is not factual to the real experience. Afterward, Ralston continues his trek and ends up, as the real Aron Ralston named his book, stuck ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"". What follows is his incredible journey to free himself, rappel a 65 foot rock wall and hike over 8 miles to finally be rescued in one of the most emotional endings in a film to date.There were a lot of challenges in developing a feature length film based on Ralston's amazing story. Many wondered how director Danny Boyle would keep the audience engaged since the setting is a single place with a single character. Not to mention the fact that we all know how the story ends up. Nominated for six Academy Awards including Best Actor and Best Picture it's obvious they overcame these challenges. For one thing, the pacing is perfect as was the accompanying music. Boyle seamlessly transitioned slow dismal scenes with those of courage and optimism. This worked largely due to the variety of music used in the film. From the outstanding original score from A.R. Rahmin to the uplifting ""Lovely Day"" by Bill Withers and the surreal finale from Sigur Rós. To me it seemed like the music was an auditory way of showing his inner thoughts during the whole experience, the soundtrack was a character all it's own.""127 Hours"" is a powerful movie and story. One in which could not have been so successful had it not been for the astounding direction and cinematography. Boyle's team brought the experience of trekking the Utah canyons to life with fluid camera work. A closeup shot of Franco's hand sliding against the rock wall while navigating through the canyon is just one of many examples. Personally, I thought this film should have been not only nominated for Best Cinematography in the Academy Awards but also won. Boyle is a master of his craft and this film further propels him to the top of the list of best directors working today.I won't get into the ""meat"" of the amputation scene, but I will say that it was one of the most intense things I've witnessed in film. That is saying a lot considering the types of movies I watch and review here. Disturbingly accurate this scene was filmed in one take using multiple camera's and only one prosthetic arm. Yet another testimony to Franco's superb acting. Following the amputation scene we see more outstanding direction and cinematography as Ralston makes the final journey to his rescue. The best part about this final sequence is that we know what happens but while watching we are at the edge of our seat. We put aside what we already know and just go along for the ride. The direction causes us to be unsure if he will make it or not. That is the brilliance of ""127 Hours"" and Boyle's production team.I highly recommend this film as it is one of the best stories and film of at least the last few years. Boyle said it best and I'll end this review with his quote: ""This is a film about how precious life is. And it's only precious because of other people. It's not precious in itself, which is what we sometimes think - we think the will to survive is an individualistic thing. ... But it's actually connected to other people. And that's what the life essence is really about - it's always about other people, even in the loneliest places."" - Danny Boylehttp://cinemapat.blogspot.com/2011/03/127-hours-danny-boyle-2010.html",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Inspiring, strong movie.","As I was watching this movie for the first time, I instantly knew it would find itself on my favorite movies list. ""127 Hours"" is a movie about a man named Aron Ralston, an everyday guy with a passion for mountain climbing and anything outdoors, who winds up stuck on the line between life and death- or rather, between freedom and a boulder. He is pinned by his arm against a canyon wall and has to take a stab at surviving. It is based on a true story.I have a lot of respect for Danny Boyle. I have always loved his style of directing, so I was keen to see what his next project would be after ""Slumdog Millionaire"" swept the Oscars in 2008. I had heard this story many times before, so I was instantly interested in how Boyle would turn this tragic story into a big screen movie. He did not disappoint. One of my favorite things about the movie is that Danny Boyle stayed really close to the actual story. The real Aron Ralston said so himself that the movie is as accurate as you can get while still being a drama.Boyle made the right choice in bringing back A. R. Rahman to score the movie. The music is what completed the movie, in more ways than it would affect other movies because of the situation. There are scenes that portray just plain emotion, and the music adds a whole new level of depth to these scenes. The soundtrack is chilling, yet so beautiful.Casting-wise, James Franco was perfectly cast as Aron Ralston. I was a fan before, but this movie doubled my respect for him. His performance was astonishing and completely believable.Before I watched this movie, questions were floating in my head. Will this whole movie take place in the canyon? Will it be boring? Will it be sickening? No, no, and yes. About 70-75% of the movie does take place inside the canyon, but it does not get boring. Flashbacks and hallucinations fill up some time here, but during this portion of the movie (in the canyon), you feel as if you are in there yourself or that Aron is talking to you personally. The movie is very intimate. That even applies to the squeamish moments. There IS a lot of blood. Do not be surprised if you find yourself looking away from the screen at some parts (I could not help it).While watching this movie, I felt anticipation. I felt fear. I felt. optimism. I laughed. I cried. This movie truly is the whole package. I highly recommend everyone to see this movie at some point in their life. It is eye-opening and will make you wonder...what would you do if you were in Aron's shoes?",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"127 Hours is a unique and harrowing survival thriller, much in the vein of Alive.","I recently rewatched 127 Hours (2010) on MAX. The story follows a survivalist and experienced hiker who is supremely confident in his abilities-until a sudden fall leaves him trapped in a remote canyon. Only then does he realize he's made a critical mistake: he didn't tell anyone where he was going. Alone and facing impossible odds, he may have to take desperate measures to survive...Directed by Danny Boyle (28 Days Later), the film stars James Franco (Spider-Man), Amber Tamblyn (The Grudge 2), Treat Williams (Deep Rising), Kate Mara (The Martian), and Kate Burton (Big Trouble in Little China).The fact that this is based on a true story makes it even more intense and gripping. The writing is solid, but what truly stands out is the cinematography-smart camera angles and creative visuals keep the audience engaged throughout. The use of commercial-style flashbacks as a reflection of the protagonist's imagination is a brilliant touch. Franco delivers a flawless performance, making his character's ordeal feel painfully real. The film's effects are top-tier, and the infamous arm scene is as brutal as it is unforgettable. The closing moments, featuring real-life photos of those involved, provide a powerful and fitting conclusion.In the end, 127 Hours is a unique and harrowing survival thriller, much in the vein of Alive. I'd rate it 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Compelling viewing.,"Although undeniably amazing, the story of Aron Ralston isn't something that strikes you as ripe for cinematic treatment. It's more the sort of yarn suited to a half hour doco, seeing as the action is stuck in the one place for five days. It's a marvel then – although not overly surprising – that Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy, director and writer respectively of the phenomenal Slumdog Millionaire, have eked out a worthy story that capably fits the feature film format.They've developed the premise to focus more on the mentality of Ralston during his suffering. He cycled through a gamut of emotions – regret, despair, acceptance, anger, frustration, embarrassment – and how Boyle presents these is definitely left of centre, but all the more intriguing for it. The use of flashbacks and dream segments are often lazily used to convey a character's thoughts, although they're still a damn fine narrative tool if you use them correctly and Boyle wonderfully segues in and out of these sequences as if they were an extension of the present action.Some of Ralston's delirium-fuelled moments are cringe-worthy and humiliating, but Boyle doesn't shoot them with a rose coloured lens. What you see is an authentic depiction of how this man (re)acted to the gradual realisation these were his last days on earth. When you're on your own with no hope of surviving, why concern yourself with something trivial like how you might look if there was ever a movie made about you? Well, Ralston didn't and Boyle respected that. Subsequently we, the audience, have been privy to something we weren't supposed to see, and there is something very fascinating about that.Cillian Murphy was originally planned to play the doomed adventurer, and though I'm sure he would've been great, it's now hard to imagine anyone other than James Franco in the role. The real Ralston had never allowed anyone outside of his own family and friends to see the camcorder footage he shot over those harrowing 127 hours, until he permitted both Franco and Boyle to watch it. This private screening must've been invaluable to Franco especially; his portrayal is carefully layered and well thought out. Franco slots into the ""everyman"" mould with ease and offers a quirky side to Ralston without ever being overtly quirky. Colin Firth should win the Best Actor Oscar for The King's Speech, but Franco thoroughly deserves his nomination and I'm sure we haven't seen the last of him come future awards seasons.An ordinary man placed in an extraordinary situation is compelling viewing thanks to Boyle's masterful direction and Franco's powerful performance.4 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Fine, 3 - Good, 4 - Great, 5 - Brilliant)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Inspiring stuff from Danny Boyle...,"I know it's April already and this film came out in the UK in January, but after a very long wait it has finally landed at my local cinema! Since I've waited such a long time to see it there was no way I was going to miss it! I even dragged a friend along who doesn't often see this sort of thing. I'll give you my thoughts after this very brief summary (summary haters, and those that don't wish to know about the plot, please try to shift that rock while I write the next paragraph).Aron Ralston is an adventurer, mountain climber, he's most at home with all outdoor types of activities. He feels he doesn't have to rely on anyone else and has cut himself off from his friends and family to concentrate on the things he likes to do. Little does he know this is going to cost him dear. He goes out canyoneering alone near Moab, Utah but doesn't take his mobile phone (or cell phone if you prefer) with him and doesn't tell anyone where he's going. There he meets two girls, Kristi and Megan and they have a bit of fun jumping into a pool below a crack in the rocks. Eventually they go their separate ways and Aron heads off alone again. Taking a route seldom used he causes a rock fall that leaves him trapped, pinned by the arm with a large boulder. He is there for 127 hours before he uses desperate measures to free himself. During this time he reflects on the mistakes he's made in his life, making a video diary he thinks will be his legacy. I'll leave it there so as not to upset the squeamish Spoiler Police.I thought this was a very well made film with several devices used to keep the audience interested. Split screens, flashbacks, dream sequences all keep the thing moving along nicely. I have to say it's an outstanding performance from James Franco as Aron Ralston, he really nailed it! Honourable mentions also go to Kate Mara as Kristi and Amber Tamblyn as Megan.I love the visual style used by Danny Boyle in this one. It could have been a tough gritty drama like the 2003 Kevin Macdonald film Touching the Void, (also a very fine film by the way) but I found it was a lot more than that. It will make you cringe, it will make you laugh, and it will even make some of you cry, but I found it very engaging and very enthralling (even though I knew what the final outcome was) Definitely recommended.PS My friend thought it was good but a bit padded out with all that hallucinating & stuff (His words, not mine).My Score: 8.6/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Extraordinary!!,"This film is about a young adventurous man's struggle to stay alive and free himself, as he gets stuck between rocks in a canyon during his solitary weekend hiking trip.""127 Hours"" is an extraordinary tale of survival. It tells how desperate measures are needed in desperate times. Viewers connect with Aron Ralston easily, as it is not unlikely that an average person encounters an accident during a hike like he did. The particularly graphic scene is disturbing and unsettling, and yet it makes viewers' spirits high in the hope of the better evil winning against the clock.The accompanying soundtrack is very good, particularly the appropriately triumphant music that plays at the end. It's good that this amazing tale of survival is told to a wider audience.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A good movie,"The movie got a lot of things right. James Franco played the part excellently, the soundtrack was good and adequate and the writing was good enough to keep the audiences glued to their seat.I wouldn't go far to say that this movie is a trend-setter in any genre but definitely a good watch. The humor was unique and kept the audience wary. Considering the fact that this was a real life story and the script was borrowed from a book, it simply boiled down to the execution and acting and both were spot on.Franco comes across as this sweet loving guy that the viewer wants to win this challenge he is facing and come out alive. That simple premise is enough to make a hero out of him as he eventually makes it. Soundtrack from Rahman was at times distracting but it seems like there was a deliberate attempt at avoiding the stereotypical music that goes into such films, which is edgy and eerie. But instead, the music here is grand and elevates all emotions coming from the viewer.In the end it is a film about the human spirit and what really drives, motivates and inspires us. If you can take that from the film then Danny Boyle has done his job well. 127 hours.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Scooby- Doo where are you?,"Aron Ralston: ""I'm in pretty deep dodo here.""The story is about a mountain climber becomes trapped under a boulder in a remote area near Moab, Utah, he must resort to extreme measures in order to survive.Danny Boyle once again proves that he is a fantastic director in this movie. The way he shots and show the trouble that are main character goes through, it's truly great. The cinematography in this movie took the wind out of me it's that brilliant. This is James Franco best role I've seen him. He made me care about his character and he almost made my cry a little a bit.My only nick picks with the film are the goofy scenes with the Scooby-Doo scene. I'm sorry but that scene came out of no where and lost the serious of the movie for me, and I no his seeing things because his losing a lot of blood and he's in a tight space, but still you can't help to ask ""What the hell was all that about?"".127 hours is a excellent film with mind blowing camera work and one of the best directing I've seen since Spielberg.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Against All Odds,"Danny Boyle's film based on real events is all at once a horrifying, explicit, and oftentimes heartwarming movie. A story of remarkable human resilience, Boyle and star James Franco make an involving and personal film about a man versus the elements.The film tells the true story of Aron Ralston, a professional rock climber. On this particular weekend, he decides to go to the desert without telling anyone where he is going. After biking for 17 miles, he runs into two girls—the last people to see him while he still had his forearm. After going their separate ways, Ralston continues hiking through canyons. While going into one, a boulder slips from under his feet and his right arm becomes pinned between the boulder and the wall of the canyon. This is where the movie really begins.Essentially a one man show, James Franco gives the best performance of his career as the man caught between a rock and a hard place. His slow descent into hopelessness, madness, and finally, assertiveness, is sadistically fun to watch. Even if it is hard to sympathize with a cocky rock climber, as the movie progresses. Franco's character becomes more and more identifiable, eventually coming to embody any one of us who has gone through painful decisions and excruciating circumstances. Franco gives his character a mixture of warmth, strangeness, and—when he cuts his own arm off—complete baddass-ness.Danny Boyle gives it his all with this brutal account of survival. It's a hard thing to get right, making a movie that almost entirely takes place in one small spot; but Boyle triumphs. The bloody and gut- wrenching amputation scene will have even the most jaded movie goer squirming in their seats. Yet, what makes this movie great is the warmth and sentiment Boyle places at the heart of this film. Our character looks back on his life, family, and ex-girlfriend. And he even has a vision of his future son. Boyle is able to take a bleak and bitter tale of survival, and turn it into a glorious film of hope and beauty. The movie is beautifully photographed by Anthony Mantle, with saturated colors that almost engulf us into the desert.Still, the film belongs to Franco. His Oscar-worthy performance is the centerpiece of 127 Hours. Although Boyle sometimes strays into predictability, and the arbitrary split-screen editing is unnecessary at best, the movie is so involving that you'll forget you're even in the theater. The music, cinematography, and directing all come together to make this movie one of the best of the year.http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Unarguably, the BEST.","This is a movie with a great heart, unbelievable script, super acting, a great director and most importantly a portrayal of a real life superhuman. The moment you enter the theatre, everything keeps you occupied. You don't want get up of the seat for a second, even to pee. I mean it. The minute details, camera work and music everything just complements the film and makes it what I call a masterpiece. At the end of film, you see Aron Ralston (James Franco) and ask yourself a question, 'What on earth was this? Did This happen for real?'. Your heart just fills with respect and honor for the man. You realize the importance of relations, friends and family. I believe watching this super movie is a great inspiration and has had a great positive impact on many. Aron Ralston is a educator and has educated me and millions others. After seeing, you are motivated and ask yourself, ""What on earth were you doing till now? You give up at petty thing without even trying.""The Spirit of Aron can't be put up on this short review but all I can say that it was breathtaking. The adventure he continues now is an inspiration for any living soul. The motto correctly goes with the movie. ""There is no force stronger on earth than the will to live.""All I can say is that if ""Slumdog Millionaire"" kinda crap can win a Oscar, there needs to be a new award invented for this.

This isn't Boyle's best work, but by providing beautiful cinematography and using bold and elegant camera-work to bring this remarkable true story to the screen, he's able to take you along for another unforgettable journey.

But then again everyone in the theater cringed when it all happened, so I wasn't the only one.See it if you dig Danny Boyle and especially if you're a Franco fan, even though I think the film lacks many qualities of a great film. 127 Hours is possibly Franco's best performance so far, maybe with the exception of Freaks and Geeks.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

How else can you show the vulnerability and restlessness of a dying person, in the middle of nowhere; if not how this film portray.

Brilliant!,"What made this movie in my opinion splendid lies within its sincerity. It is naked in its creation. There is not a scene that is Hollywoodized except maybe the ending: some might argue that the ending of a movie should and is key, and I would consider myself within that class: but in 127 Hours, the climax is the very ending- it Had to intensified- Aron Ralston beautifully portrayed by James Franco has a newfound respect for Human Contact at the very end of the movie. What made the epiphany genuinely real, is, as opposed to epiphanies related to Religion, Politics, Societal conflicts, this one rose from a near-death experience, which tends to be the most honest one of all.Cheers to Danny Boyle for having achieved very hard directing, namely shooting 90% of the movie with one character having introspections on himself- this could have easily been a calamity, it was anything but!I highly recommend this philanthropy-oriented movie. I believe the directing and James Franco did a wonderful job and hopefully 127 Hours' success will open more doors for James Franco.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A thrilling survival movie based on a true story!,"I remember when I first saw the poster for this movie a couple of years ago. I had no idea what it was about, but the poster caught my attention. I later discovered that the movie was actually based on a true story, of a man who got stuck with his arm between a rock in the middle of nowhere. He then survived for 127 hours (hence the title of the movie) before he cut his own arm off, and got loose.I didn't actually see the movie 'till only a couple of weeks ago, and man. Did it really excel. The survival elements are excellent, and you can feel the struggle this man is going through. He tries desperately to stay alive and not loose his sanity and by that I mean if he really goes insane , he's done for. James Franco portrays the man who got stuck, the man being Aron Ralston and Franco really delivers. The pacing of the film is also great, which really surprised me.

127 Hours: 9/10,"Ask yourself before going into this film, am I prepare to watch a guy cutting off his arm (slowly), am I prepare to see James Franco face throughout the entire film? Well, if you're not, see it anyways. Directed by Danny Boyle and starring James Franco, 127 Hours is really another masterpiece after Boyle's Slumdog Millionaire. With flashy images and colors, Danny Boyle's style is showing up more in his films. 127 Hours is about a guy cutting off his arm. That is the plot, basic and simple. Aron Ralston is a hardcore biker who loves to climb and one day, just as you predicts, he got trapped. Being stuck in between a rock for 5 days with limited food, little water, no heat, and no restroom can really change a person's point of view. Seeing how he survives the five days feels like I'm watching a camping film. But 127 Hours is more than that, it has this hidden feeling that you feel bad for this guy. With his charming personality, James Franco was able to portray Aron Ralston accurately. This guy was really funny throughout the film even though he had to cut off his own hand. But whenever the movie focuses on how Aron survives, it becomes a movie about survival. This film is strictly about the art of cutting one's hand. 127 Hours gathers all the style of Danny Boyle and put it all together. And with James Franco playing the lead, it couldn't have been better.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Honest inspiration,"""If I believethere's more than this"", sings Dido, that forgotten British lady who gave us great hits and beautiful songs such as ""White Flag"" and ""Here With me"". She always had a lovely voice, but these words she's singing in the name of Aron Ralston, the man who got his hand caught in a huge rock while climbing in the John Blue Canyon in Utah. We know who Aron is in a heartbeat; that is, James Franco defines the character in a couple of scenes. This he does not by speaking, but by actions: singing freely, running wild. Aron meets two girls and they sense he could be from another galaxy. He cares about nothing, he has not another person in mind and what he needs and loves is in front of him: big mountains.That's also what Danny Boyle needs. The mountains and James Franco are sufficient elements to make a whole movie. On the other hand, I think that by now we can agree that Boyle (alongside writer Simon Beaufoy) loves to inspire these days. That's what ""Slumdog Millonaire"" was and what ""127 hours"" is: inspiring (and inspired –I might say this a lot, but it's true-) filmmaking. If the previous film was about impossible love and rising above the circumstances to achieve the impossible, this new tale is the same thing, without the ""love"" factor. That is the factor that allowed Boyle to tell ""Slumdog"" as a fable, with hopeful music, bright colors and beautiful little things (or moments) in the ugliest places. For those who thought this was an erroneous decision, disrespectful towards a country's reality, ""127 hours"" arrives to prove them wrong.There's no embellishment here. No other color than James Franco's pale face and the red blood that comes out of his trapped arm. As real as a man who struggles for his life, with no water and food, begging for some sunlight and the response of a raven, the tale –while never losing track of its tragic center, that Boyle and the master Anthony Dod Mantle try to represent through various 'desperate' shots, like Aron's tongue seen from the inside of a bottle of water and other camera and mise-en-scene resolutions- takes flight through imagination.In Aron's situation, in which he tries to rise above the impossible as he thinks about who he is and what he's done in life (painfully- ""every moment since the day I was born has brought me to this rock"", he whispers-), imagination can be nothing but poetic (it's hard to accept it, but poetry in cinema –visual, narrative poetry- can be boring, really boring –not always-. Boyle makes it inspiring. I started with that statement so I'll try to get back to it). Aron searches for moments in the past, he envisions people in the dark and meticulously reconstructs a near future. Poetic means inexistent piano melodies in the air, or a beautiful woman saying an ""I love you"" that no one can hear. Some of the things he experiences are otherworldly.The most recent movies about characters alone with the world were Sean Penn's ""Into the wild"" and Rodrigo Cortes' ""Buried"". The first movie is about a boy who has lived a lie and decides to find truth in standing alone in front of Mother Earth. His personal story has affected him, and before he's completely by himself, he changes (willingly or not; it doesn't matter, it just happens) the lives of the people he meets. Chris (or Alexander Supertramp) has an ideology and talks a lot about it, but it's not the most consistent element of the movie. In ""Buried"", ideology is everything, powered by a great original idea. A man is trapped in a coffin, underground, and as he tries to survive (there are some good 'survival' sequences), every line of dialogue is spoken to criticize the government. There's no personal story whatsoever, only daggers thrown at the policies towards hostages in foreign land.Let's recapitulate, because I want to get to the transparent inspiration that lies in the story of ""127 Hours"". In ""Into the wild"", Supertramp ends up alone in Alaska by personal choice. You can be inspired by several reasons that can be found in the journey of the film (a road trip in the end), even more if you believe in the character's ideas. In ""Buried"", the main character is captured on purpose. You can be inspired if you support his political ideas, his will to get out of that coffin or his family waiting at home? There's not real inspiration there.In ""127 Hours"", however, Aron being trapped is not planned (this is all the more surprising), but as he goes back on who he is, at some point he even believes it was not an accident. It's that idea what's inspiring. Aron spends 127 hours revising these thoughts. He rediscovers himself as a person and we get to know him as a man who wants to overcome the impossible. What's even more purely inspiring, besides the fact that Boyle fractures the screen and races through the scenery in order to make this introspective journey more exciting (as only himself can); besides the fact that the director has found in A.R Rahman the perfect partner to tell stories that cannot live without music (now without HIS music); and besides the fact that James Franco takes on the role as if it was his own life on the screen; is that unlike a lot of these kinds of movies, Aron does what he does not to prove a point, or to set an example, or because he stands for something. He does it for himself because he wants to. In those hours, he somehow realizes he has to do it. Wellthat's when nothing can stop you.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Vidiot Reviews...,"127 HoursLosing an appendage can be cause for celebration, so long as it happens at work and you have coverage.Unfortunately, the incident involving the young man in this drama occurred on the weekend, sans the protection of workers comp.After parting ways with a pair of hikers (Kate Mara, Amber Tamblyn) that he met while out on the trail of a Utah National Park, amateur adventurer Aron Ralston (James Franco) falls down a crevasse, where his right hand is pinned beneath a boulder.Unable to free himself, his water depleted, and his mind reeling with famine-induced visions of past relationships with his parents and ex-girlfriend, Aron is finally forced to make a grievous decision if he hopes to survive.Based on Ralston's autobiography, 127 Hours is a gripping, grotesque exposition of human endurance, masterfully executed by director Danny Boyle.Besides, what mountaineer wouldn't want an ice axe for a hand? (Green Light)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Rock On,"Danny Boyle has turned out to be the quite the multifaceted auteur. He's created unique examples of what are possible with both the horror and science fiction genres (at times blending the two), and he's tackled the grim reality of humanity in his Oscar-winning film Slumdog Millionaire. It should come as no surprise, then, that 127 Hours is a beautifully filmed, expertly nuanced story about what fuels both delirium and perseverance.The movie is based on a true story. In 2003, canyoneer Aron Ralston decided to embark on a weekend hike in a mountainous region of Utah. After miscalculating a step while traversing a crevice, Aron fell down a sheer embankment and had his arm pinned against the cliff face by an oblong boulder. As you'd expect, a previously happy-go-lucky situation turns gruesome in a split-second, and, to make matters worse, it's only a matter of time before Aron depletes his limited supply of water and prepackaged goodies.A misconception that seems to linger about 127 Hours is that exists for the singular ""gross out"" moment—you know, when our protagonist realizes his only chance of escape is to whittle away at this trapped arm until a bloody stump is all that remains. In fact, Boyle's film is more focused on Aron's life leading up to the accident, which is wrought with the misgivings of someone who's been much too selfish. As it turns out, it would take something as drastic as facing a life or death situation for Aron to come to grips with his passive-aggressive abandonment of everyone he's ever cared for.By allowing us into the mind of our lead we're able to experience how a dehydration-fueled delirium brought to light the things in Mr. Ralston's life that actually matter. So integral are these hallucinations that it's sometimes difficult to separate what Aron is really going through as opposed to what's taking place in his mind, but Boyle expertly balances his tale by bringing Aron (and the audience) back to reality when things seem to be utterly lost in a maze of all-too-tangible illusions.Besides the thematic victories that are embodied in 127 Hours, it's also —quite simply—a movie that's very easy on the eyes. The rolling canyons and red plains make for a stunning backdrop, and the horror unfolding in the small crack Aron inhabits serves as an effective juxtaposition to the sprawling beauty that's just beyond his reach (figuratively, literally, etc.).In short, Boyle strikes again. Pay the $10 for a ticket and catch this one before it leaves theaters.Trust me. It's worth it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
127 hours gripping or boring?,"Hello guys127 hours Gripping or boring?Just finished watching the critically acclaimed 127 hours by Danny Boyle , after going in with one advert shooting through my head 'amazing , power , magnificent etc etc.' I was ready to be let down by yet another award movie that only the snobs like i.e. (Oscar award panel) I was surprised that this film was not all that appeared it was not a desperate struggle to cut his arm off but a psychological battle with himself up to that point of why he always isolates himself from affection and is this rock just his come upence really. The trailer did mislead really as it made it look like similar movie buried. The difference was the actor no offence to Ryan Reynolds who is amazing James Franco was spot on with his portrayal.The Story as everyone knows is of Hiker  going out into the desert and cliff by himself and getting trapped by a rock and left for 127 hours to survive until the inevitable choice do I cut my arm off to get free.The film made on a she string budget by genius Danny Boyle (28 days later) made this film not to shock which it did, people passing out in cinema but to make people think what they would, wait an die of starvation or cut your arm off and wait for someone to come 5 seconds later and it to be for nothing? That's the overriding question that has to be asked really.James Franco who I have seen little of in a serious acting role i.e. Spiderman which I couldn't stand and the wonderfully underrated pineapple express which he played against character really. But within this you could see he had worked on trying to get the right balance between desperation and over acting and he did with a twist of insanity when has talking to himself very funny.The awards season always does bring out these sort of movies 'art house' flicks that love to bore people into the ground and then at the end say bravo mentioning no names 'hurt locker' but this was made for a wider public to see it was made to be marketed as a film you just had to see. This film is not for the easily amused or the easily distracted it is for the ones who as my brother would say live within each movie they watch and feel what the character feels.This Film does have Barlington's seal of recommendation!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A situation that you absolutely never want to end up in,"Do not usually like these films where for example is stuck out at sea or things of that sort. But I must admit that this was really good. Not the year's best film, but it is still good. Was a little surprised when I saw that the director was the one who had directed the film ""Slumdog Millionaire"". Did that ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was a LOUSY movie that lacks most of the time. There was the ""127 Hours"" a major step forward from the ""Slumdog Millionaire"". So I give ""127 Hours"" a 4 of 5.If I'm going to be critical, it felt as if the cameraman was standing on one foot. It shakes a lot and changing angles too quickly. I saw many mistakes with the camera as the changing angles and when things are different, and other stuff that they should be more careful. According to me the camera stand up straight, and ""sometimes"" move slowly to the sides, do not change angles so quickly. It will shake and change angles quickly as it should be exciting, when there is some action. This movie did almost nothing about what I wrote up. So that's a big minus. So therefore the number 4 a weak 4: a. Camera: IG!James Franco is playing well in the role of Aaron. He is a bit of the feeling that it should be if you sit down with your hand over a giant boulder, and dying. Bothered me a bit of the movie when he thought that he came out of the stone, and went away with the car, and so on ... I think that a movie should be as it is, and not hold on to dream of things that have not happened yet. Otherwise a good movie. Will not take anything away from the weak 4-ball, but there are a lot of tabs in the film. Oscar nominated for Best Picture? No.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
