Great end to the trilogy,"I know it's hard for any sequel to live up to the original. Yes, the first 'Back to the Future' film is definitely the best, but - come on - as far as sequels go, 'Parts II & III' are still pretty impressive. I know they may not have the same 'original feel' to them, but they at least to a fantastic job of expanding the original concept/mythology and growing the much-loved characters we met in the first outing.I doubt there are many people who will decide to watch 'Part III' of a trilogy first, so my advice is watch them all in order. Then you can experience the full magic of watching a young high school student (Marty McFly - played perfectly by Michael J Fox) get caught up in with his friend 'Doc Brown's' (played by the only person seemingly capable of upstaging Michael J Fox here - Christopher Lloyd) exploits with a time-travelling DeLorean carThere's a brief recap at the beginning of the film as to how our heroes have become stuck in the past and now they have to go further back to the Wild West in order to get home - don't worry, if that sounds confusing - it all makes sense if you've watched all three.What you have here is a movie that feels totally at home in the 'Back to the Future' trilogy, but this time is set among cowboys and spittoons. It delights in poking fun of the time period and genre, plus gives us familiar faces/enemies in the form of series antagonist 'Biff Tannen's' long lost grandfather as a murderous outlaw - naturally hell-bent on causing all sorts of problems for our heroes. Plus we even have a love interest for Doc - which does add a new dimension to the story. Normally if a new character is introduced so late it feels a bit jarring - I'm glad to say that here the insertion of 'Clara Clayton' feels organic and a necessity to the overall story.You may not love it as much as the first, you may also consider this (or the second) to be the 'weakest' in the series, but even if that's true - it's still fantastic family entertainment. There are few films that can be considered 'timeless' (especially those made today), but the 'Back to the Future' trilogy can still be enjoyed by the whole family and holds up as it ever did (even if it did fail to predict what 2015 would look like and many of us are still waiting for hover boards and Nike self-lacing trainers!).'Rick and Morty' may be cool, but they'll never be as well-loved as those they are spoofing. Long may the 'Back to the Future' trilogy never be remade/rebooted/whatever. 'Part III' may only be an 8/10, but overall the series will always remain a 'perfect 10.'",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Marty, Doc, Zemeckis, And Gale pay homage to the Old West","Having set a new standard in time travel films with Back To The Future and Back To The Future Part II, it was with eager anticipation that I looked forward to seeing if Robert Zemeckis could bring his trilogy to a satisfying conclusion.  To conclude any trilogy in a successful manner some of the key ingredients you need are:  1. do something in your wrap up you haven't done before 2. keep the main characters true to what they have been previously 3. tie up all the loose threads and 4. give us a satisfying ending.For this third outing in the series, Zemeckis takes us where we have yet to tread, that being 1885 Hill Valley.  With Marty trapped once again in the year 1955, he enlists the 1955 Doc Brown to help him return home.  As we know by now, things are never that simple when it comes to Marty and Doc. Marty has no magic ruby slippers to click together three times and say, ""There's no place like home.""  It seems Doc ended up in the Old West, but hid the DeLorean in a cave for Marty to find some 70 years later so he may return home back to 1985 and destroy the time machine.  After discovering that Doc met with some misfortune shortly after arriving in 1885 Hill Valley, Marty decides to travel back in time to rescue him.While BTTFIII does not have the break neck frantic pace of Part II, it is a good film on its own.  For the first time, Zemeckis slows things down a bit, making this third film straightforward, yet just as delightful in a lot of ways as the other films.  The first thing he does is throw us a little change up.  Zemeckis and Gale decide to center the complications of this third film around Doc Brown by having him fall unexpectedly in love with a school teacher by the name of Clara(Mary Steenburgen).  In essence, Doc loses his head over a woman and loses his scientific reasoning in the process.  It is left up to Marty to become the voice of reason when Doc begins to let his emotions rule his reactions.  Yet, Marty seems as a amused as we are by the whole thing.  This is one romance that could easily have been the downfall of this film, but thanks to the performances of Steenburgen and Christopher Lloyd, together they develop a chemistry that makes it all work and work to perfection.  So by having the majority of the film take place in the old west, then introducing something to the plot we didn't expect, Zemeckis takes care of the first point I mentioned above.There's also the matter of Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen. The meanest, grimiest, filthiest, most ruthless outlaw to ever inhabit Hill Valley.  If you liked Thomas F. Wilson's portrayals of Biff, you'll be amazed at his rambunctious portrayal of Mad Dog.  He even somehow manages to top his villainous portrayals in the first two films which is not an easy task.  So yes, all the characters from the first two films are here in some form or another, and though Doc Brown may be in love, he is still the Doc.  This solidly takes care of my second point about keeping the characters true to what they have been before.Zemeckis and Gale have been absolute geniuses in writing these films.  In each film they have taken little pieces from the previous films and make them essential to what's happening.  For instance, if you've seen the second part there is a short scene that is extremely relevant to what goes on in the finale.  When originally viewing it in Part II, I'm sure you never gave it a second thought.  When the pay off comes in this film, you can't help but chuckle and say, oh I see.  As for my third point about tying up loose ends, they do that and tie up some things we didn't even know were loose ends.In Part II, it was necessary for several of the actors to play different roles.  This one is no different.  Besides being Marty Mcfly, Fox also portrays his ancestor Shamus Mcfly, who is Irish, and again Fox shows his versatility as Lea Thompson does as his wife Maggie.  Of course James Tolkan is back as Strickland and theres a couple of good jokes about his character that will surprise you...well at least one of them will surprise you the other will just leave you laughing.  As if all this wasn't good enough, Zemeckis also gives us several old western character actors, Dub Taylor, Pat Buttram, and Harry Carey Jr. Another great touch thrown in just for the fun of it.In reviewing the fist two parts of the trilogy, I failed to mention Alan Silvestri's terrific score.  All three films owe a great deal of their success to it, and the fact that he was able to keep the same theme, yet do variations on it that perfectly fitted each film deserves as much credit as all the others responsible for making this film received.So what about point 4, a satisfying ending?  Of course, you'll have to see the film to find out for yourself.  I can only say that when Part 3 was over I felt a certain amount of sadness that the trilogy had ended.  Even now when I watch the three films, I wish there had been a fourth, and a fifth. This was not because the ending of the third film left me unsatisfied in anyway, quite the contrary in fact.  It was because I would miss not only the films themselves, but most of all the rich detail and characterizations brought to life for us by a wonderful cast, director, writers and the rest of the crew responsible for enabling us to enjoy one of the most memorable series of films ever. And when you live in my memory forever, you get my grade.  For Back To The Future Part III it's an A+. As for the trilogy, there is no grade high enough, no rating high enough, for me to give it the award it so richly deserves.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
No one's future is written for them,"Sitting back to watch the final, for now, entry in the Back to the Future trilogy, I was a little disheartened. I had a lot of fun with this series, and was sad not to be traveling through the dimensions of time with Marty and Doc Brown for the last time. But alas, all good things must come to an end, and of course, I can always rent the DVD, or perhaps even add any of them to my own collection. Back to the Future Part III, didn't simply ""phone it in"" for its' final act, it provided a complete compilation to its time travel exploits.This story picks up where the second left off; with Marty (Michael J. Fox) acting on a letter he received from Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). At the conclusion of Back to the Future Part II, the DeLorean is struck by lightning, with Doc inside, and he is transported all the way back to 1885, in the old west. Since Doc had always dreamed of living in the Wild West, he was not severely disappointed to be stuck in the 1800's, and he certainly was stuck because it would be 70 or so years before the replacement parts he needed to repair the DeLorean would exist. He writes Marty a letter explaining to him what he is up to and that he is fine and should be left in 1885. Soon after receiving the letter, however, Marty uncovers that Doc Brown is about to die. Unwilling to leave him to that fate, Marty ignores all risks, intent on traveling to 1885, to find Doc Brown. This would prove impossible without a trip back to 1955, to get some help from the Doc Brown of the past. Marty's crash landing in 1885 creates quite a conundrum, however, as a fuel line breaks causing all of the gas to leak out of the DeLorean. Doc reminds him that gas hasn't been invented yet, and they will have to be innovative to find a way to power the DeLorean to the necessary 88 M.P.H. needed to travel through time. After devising a plan to power the DeLorean by locomotive power, a new distraction, of a feminine nature arrives. A Ms. Clara Clayton greets Doc Brown, and he is instantly smitten by her. Doc even vows to stay in the past with Clara after helping Marty fix the DeLorean. Our Heroes situation is made even more difficult because Marty, in typical McFly fashion refuses to be called ""chicken"", or ""yellow"" in 1885 terms. After an altercation with Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), Marty gains the attention of the gun that he discovered was to kill Doc. In the final installment of Robert Zemeckis beloved time traveling adventure, out duo is outrunning a gun, deciding between love and fate, and learning that the words of others should only ever be words rather than a reflection of ourselves; a pleasing finale to the Back to the Future series.Once again, the brilliant on-screen chemistry of Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd bring Back to the Future Part III to life. Years working together on the same franchise were nothing to dilute the pair's on-screen chemistry. Still as engaging as ever, it was pure joy to watch Marty and Doc on screen again, one last time. This film also kept the heart in to the movie. Each entry in this trilogy has heart at the center, no pun intended. It was endearing to see our zany Doc Brown fall in love, even if he did wish to pick his new love over traveling with Marty.I would recommend Back to the Future Part III to almost anyone. Rated PG, it is appropriate and engaging for all ages. Fans of the trilogy have to see it, as it wraps up all of our favorite's story lines. Anyone who believes in the power of love, time, and destiny will feel empowered by the message. I'm not sure what type of viewer Couldn't find something to appreciate about Back to the Future Part III, and to me, that's exactly how a franchise should end; pleasing the one time viewer and the series fanatic alike.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
The Perfect Finale to a Wonderful Trilogy,"As a loyal fan of the Back to the Future phenomenon, I long awaited a chance to publish my take on the series.  It may be a bit surprising to some that I would choose to write my comments in the section specific to the last movie which has been considered to be the worst film of the trilogy.For many years, in consideration of this one trilogy which served to inspire and excite me as to possibilities of the motion picture industry, I would look with a disappointment on BTTF Part Three, believing it to be an unwelcome, unexciting film which ended the legacy.However, recently it came upon me to purchase the trilogy on VHS and re-experience it, as I had once did, though now from a more balanced perspective.  I watched the first two Back to the Future movies avoided the third in the fear of being once again disappointed.  Utter disappointment is no longer the feeling I can use to describe my take of the movie.Back to the Future 3 is a well-written, well-directed, well-balanced piece. With an incredible musical score, brilliant acting and excellent composition, the movie reminded me that Back to the Future was never about action.  It was truly about the characters we came to know and love in the first movie.  It was a return to the basics, the friendship between Marty and Doc and how each was thrown through time to change not only the future of Hill Valley, but also their own lives and their future choices.Robert Zemeckis' (the writer) decision to send the two friends back to 1885, in their final adventure, was brilliant.  Imagery like the ""famous Hill Valley courthouse under construction"" and the ""steam engine train wheeling up to the rear of the futuristic Delorean"" was unforgettable.  For example, the dancing at the Courthouse welcoming festivities contrasted with the action-laden scene (in BTTF2) between Griff and Marty at the same place just a century and a half later.All in all, Back to the Future Part Three was a perfect ending to a perfect trilogy.  To anyone who despises this film, I recommend another full watching.  There are so many details which are kudos out to fans of the previous two movies.  The movie successfully slowed the pace of the other two movies (in preparation for conclusion) without losing the loyalty of true fans.  It captured the essence of what brought these fans to Back to the Future in the first place.If you haven't seen it, rent and enjoy :)  If you have seen it and wasn't particularly pleased, I beg another viewing.L8r!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Just as incredible as the first two, Back To The Future III provides two hours of great fun.","Doc Brown and Marty McFly are back for another time travel adventure, and once again their exploits are great to watch. The film is well-written and directed, and all of the actors  involved delivered spectacular performances once again. There could not have been a sharper contrast between the last Back To The Future and this one (we go from the neon colored future of flying cars and 3D movies to the old dirty west with its overflowing spittoons and gunfighting), yet the story holds together strongly and keeps the attention of the audience from start to finish.The old west was portrayed beautifully, although maybe a bit crudely and stereotypically, and the way that the town of Hill Valley was transformed for all three films is one of the biggest highlights of the series as a whole. In Back To The Future III, the challenges that face Doc and Marty are ingenius, and a solution to their problems is extremely difficult to think of, which makes it that much more fun to watch the film.Back To The Future III is an excellent way to have ended the trilogy, which as a whole is among the best trilogies ever made. What other group of movies follows the same characters through their adventures which take place in three different centuries? Clearly, Back To The Future III deserves a lot of respect, as do the previous two films. They are all a huge amount of fun to watch, and the films can be enjoyed by people of all ages, which is a quality that few films possess.If you haven't seen these films, go out and get them, and if you have seen them, you may want to go out and watch them again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"""There's a man who can't hold his liquor.""","Picking up where #2 left off, Marty is stuck in 1955 again and has to explain to the 1955 Doc why he's back and uses a letter Doc sends him from 1885 to explain what happened. After fixing up the time machine (hidden in a from 1885 cave), they find out that  Doc is murdered in the past by Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen (played by Thomas F. Wilson) ""over a matter of $80 dollars."" So Marty decides to go back and rescue Doc before the murder can occur, but he is bedeviled by a rip in the fuel line - meaning they have to find another way to get the time machine to hit 88 miles per hour - and Doc falling in love with school teacher Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen). Along the way, he gets advice both from Doc and his 1885 ancestor Seamus McFly (also played by Michael J. Fox) that he should really learn to control his temper.Fox and Lloyd are fun to watch as always, and I give my hat off to the studio for hiring Mary Steenburgen as Doc's love interest and not some super model type; it's more fitting of who Doc is. Wilson's Biff Tannen officially became a traditional ""villain"" in #2 with him murdering George McFly, and now Wilson plays an even bigger villain in Buford Tannen, whom he makes both funny and menacing.Ironically, Wilson is said to be a very nice man in real life. Leah Thompson makes the most of a thankless dual role as both Lorraine McFly and Marty's great, great grandmother Maggie McFly, and James Tolkan plays his Principal character's soft spoken law man ancestor (killed in a deleted scene by Buford Tannen; ""Remember son... discipline."")It should be noted that originally there were no sequels planned with the first movie; that bit with Doc taking Marty and Jennifer to the future to help their kids was just another gag. But the film was such a hit that the studio couldn't NOT do sequels, so this one and part 2 were filmed back to back, which is becoming more of a craze these days.Although on the surface it's a lighthearted comedy about time travel, it's also about what it means to be a man. The first film defined being a man through violently standing up to your tormentors, while this film and #2 go with the theme that being a man also means you have to reign yourself in when people start annoying you. Marty' willingness to fight back was his strength in the first film but here it is his flaw, as people in both 2015, 1955 and 1885 continually get his goat. The message of self-control is bluntly stated when Doc says to Marty ""You can' t keep going off the handle every time someone calls you a name, that's why you get into that accident in the future!"" (referring of course to the car accident mentioned in part 2). It is not until Marty realizes his error when he's about to meet Buford in the gun fight that he achieves this ideal and, much to Seamus's glee, says of Buford and the opinions surrounding him ""He's an asshole! I don't care what Tannen says, and I don't care what anyone else says either!"" Because of this, he is able to avoid said accident.Also loaded with gags, references to other great westerns (""My name is Clint Eastwood."") and Doc's response to being asked if his hijacking the train is a hold up: ""It's a science experiment!""",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Underrated and unappreciated third sequel an epic time travel adventure,"Underrated doesn't deserve the hate. Back to the Future Part III is so unappreciated. I keep hearing from people how bad this film is. Am I the only one who enjoyed this film? It is not a masterpiece like the first one is but it is a tied with the first one and it is a great sequel a great end to an excellent trilogy. Back to the Future is one of my all time favorite trilogy's of all time. I love the first film to death and it is a masterpiece and I love this (the third film) to death. Back to the Future Part III in my opinion it is tied with the first one and it is one of the best sequels of all time. It is my second favorite film in the trilogy in my opinion it is better than Part II I have enjoyed it more than Part II.Michael J. Fox , Christopher Lloyd and Mary Steenburgen are excellent at acting I have enjoyed their performances. Robert Zemeckis writes and directs excellent this sequel. Alan Silvestri writes a beautiful score for third film which it was shot back to back with the second film. I Love the new score for this movie.Back to the Future Part III (1990)I love that this film was set in the Old West back in 1885. I love the rescue mission in which Marty goes back in time from the year 1955 back in to the past in to the Old West to save his best friend Doc Brown from getting killed by an outlaw Buford Tannen. I love western movies and Marty McFly was naming him self as Clint Eastwood in this film which it was brilliant. They even make similarity from A Fistful of Dollars (one of my all time favorite western films) in which Marty wears a boiler plate as a bullet proof vest in which Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) shoots Marty. This movie has comedy, adventure, action, bank robbery, train robbery, gun fights, fist fights and one explosion. Great acting from the actors, great direction and great writing, great score. This movie shows group of Indians, followed closely by Cavalry men who are chasing them. Doc saves Marty just before he would be hang by Buford and his men.I did like that the film was more focusing on Doc and Marty the characters that we care about. Rather then Loraine and Biff like Part II did. The movie wasn't dark like the second was. I love how Doc and Marty pushes the DeLorean along the spur line, on the tracks attempting to get it up to 88 miles per hour. DeLorean then reaches 88mph and disappears...with the locomotive barreling over the side of the ravine, and exploding in a huge fireball, brilliant and well done special effect. I love that the movie does not messes with the first two movies and it is an original film I appreciate that.It is Rated PG for language, sensuality and violence. It is a perfect film from the 90's that I have grew up with it. It is my second favorite film in the trilogy I love, love this film to death and doesn't deserve the hate. 10/10 Score: Bad Ass Seal Of Approval a perfect score for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back to the Old West ... Back to the Roots ... Back to the Future ...,"And here comes the conclusion of one of the finest and most likable cinematic trilogies: ""Back to the Future Part III"", more than a sequel, a resourcing in the spirit that made the first film such an endearing classic, with an even more escapist value in the setting, the Far West during the 1880's. As a Sci-Fi Family Romantic Comedy, ""Back to the Future Part III"" is already a winner, but the Western is the defining aspect of its originality.""Back to the Future Part III"" was directly made after the second, basically recycling the same material, and using the same team, the same casting etc. The continuity between the two films is so determining that there's no way watching the second without getting immediately to the third, it's like keeping in touch with the same family. Indeed, as much as I can watch the first one alone, because it's a class on its own and a film I consider slightly independent from the two sequels, on the other hand, I consider the sequels too connected to each other not to be seen in a row. This continuity helps to appreciate the second part that feels more like a link between the two other films while ""Part III"" resurrects the spirit of the first one by focusing on the emotionality rather than the eternal ""back to the future"" mission.This has always been Marty's preoccupation and the thrust of the trilogy but the travels also had the merit to solve some familial issues and help a beloved character to improve something in his life, if anything, the trilogy defines the notion of 'coming-of-age' as the inspirational aspect of the film, its encouragement for success through self-improvement. But since people were facing less materialistic issues than during the 80's, I guess there was a need to take some distance from these so-called philosophies of successes and a huge step back one century earlier when the 80's followed the Secession War and preceded the Industrial Revolution that would lead to demise of the frontier spirit. The Far West is less a setting or an era, than a state of mind, embodying the roots of the American spirit in its purest form, before greed and profit perverted its meaning. The Far West setting perfectly fitted the tormenting desire of Doc Emmett Brown for retirement and a tacit existential quest for love.Consequently, while the central character of the first film was George McFly and the second part focused on the McFly Family, Gale and Zemeckis took the last film as a great opportunity to enrich the character of Doc Brown and close his story's arc through a love story in order to replace the ""mad scientist"" label by a necessary element of three-dimensionality. On the surface, Marty's mission is to prevent Brown from being killed by the villain who –for our greatest delight- is Biff's ancestor, Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen, but while Marty and Doc try to find a solution to push the DeLorean to 88 mph, destiny puts them in Clara's path. So Doc meets Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), a teacher whose fate was to fall in the Shonash ravine canyon and give it a posthumous name.At that point of the trilogy, we're all aware of the time travels' mechanisms, we can even be surprised by Marty's incapability ""to reason fourth-dimensionally"", who he traveled so much. But here, the film invites us to put all the scientific stuff into perspective and think of the real elements that predefine our fates. There's a strong philosophical material hidden behind the love story as the film concludes its approach on time travels with the idea that nothing is written except by our free will and our capacity not to let external elements direct our lives. But I may make the film sound too intellectual when it's also a great comedy and one hell of a western.The film is the opportunity to rediscover and say goodbye to the wonderful characters of Hill Valley, to see the first McFlys in American land, to witness the inauguration of the clock tower which, as Doc said, was fitting that he and Marty could witness, not to mention Marty pretending to be named Clint Eastwood, at the risk of tarnishing this name by becoming the biggest yellow belly in the Old West. And the delight on the comedic level is in the way the humor works on a meta-referential level as if the film was breaking an imperceptible fourth wall, playing on its own trademarks. I can't resist to the scene where Marty, realizing that he might be killed instead of Doc utters a ""Great Scott"" followed by Doc's comment ""I know this is heavy"", when Marty wonders why they always have to ""cut these things so damn close"" or when, in the most dramatic situations, he reacts by an ironic 'perfect'.And speaking of dramatic, the film also provides great thrilling moments you'd expect from a Western, and probably the most heart-pounding climax from the trilogy with the train sequence, so suspenseful, I remember I had to pause for seconds the first time I watched it. This was one of the few times, I needed to take a break because it was just too suspenseful, but what a fitting and rewarding conclusion. Action, escapism, duels, stage, rides, Indians, cavalry, ""Back to the Future Part III"" is also an independent homage to the Western genre with some exhilarating moments, served by Alan Silvestri's terrific score, probably his best work in the trilogy.And this is why I consider ""Back to the Future"" as the greatest trilogy after ""The Godfather"" with a slight advantage that remains the consistency in terms of spirit, thrills, laughs and emotional value. So thank you Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale, Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd and all the team for these three unforgettable classics!",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
The difficult third part in the trilogy,"Even in the best franchises which proved that sequels can be just as good, if not better than the originals, the third parts are often fairly controversial. Look no further than to the third entries in ""The Godfather"" and ""The Terminator"" movies. ""Back To The Future III"" is no exception to that rule as it clearly is the weakest part in the trilogy, but it's still one hell of a great ride.Writer/producer Bob Gale and writer/director Robert Zemeckis are two very clever men. They know the difficulties of sequels well. As Zemeckis explains somewhere on the ""BTTF""-DVD set, the hardest part is to give the audience something new without moving too far away from the original's spirit. ""Back To The Future II"" achieved that goal gloriously (although Zemeckis who is very critical about his own work is always downsizing the greatness of it). Maybe the two Bobs went a bit too far away from what audiences loved about the original in part 3.Although the movie is set mainly in the Wild West, it's still seen through the eyes of two people from the 80's. There are shootouts, horse chases and train robberies, but ""Back To The Future III"" is never a real Western. What makes this movie seem different from its predecessors is that fittingly it doesn't have a lot to do with teen culture anymore (save for a Michael Jackson-reference). Marty himself seems to have grown up quite a bit and you'll be surprised to see him behaving more focused on his mission than Doc in the latter half of the movie. This change of places by the characters was a deliberate decision by the writers and it does push the story and the relationship of Marty and Doc forward, but something about it just doesn't feel right.It's intriguing to learn about the origins of Hill Valley and the ancestors of the McFly-clan. However, the earnest Seamus McFly and his family - that for some reason includes a woman looking like Marty's mother - seem strangely out of place in a BTTF-movie. They're just not quirky enough.What makes the story seem even more estranged is the introduction of a new character, Clara Clayton, with whom Doc falls madly in love. Now, although we should all be happy for Doc having found his own private happiness, somehow we don't want him to behave like that. It's not Doc as we know and love him - and that's exactly the problem Robert Zemeckis was talking about. Marty and Doc used to be a team. Was anyone happy for John when Yoko got between him and The Beatles?I still think ""Back To The Future III"" is an amazing accomplishment, a fine finale to one of the best trilogies ever made. You can't give enough praise to Zemeckis and Gale for not just making these movies for financial reasons but for actually trying to make them as good as possible. Personally, I love this movie to bits and I don't think it could have been realized any better. The only explanation I got for why this brilliant sequel got a lukewarm rating of 6.7 from IMDb users, is the dilemma Zemeckis himself was aware of, but couldn't fully avoid.Fans who are still longing for a fourth part should keep that in mind and would be best advised to let it go. Zemeckis and Gale have said repeatedly that they don't plan on ever continuing the story. And why should they? Everything has been said, everything has been done. The movies are perfect the way they are. Let's be thankful there are still filmmakers that stick to their artistic conviction.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Part 3-I'm afraid there's not enough room in this De Lauren for the two of us,"Well, I just finished the Back to the Future trilogy and all I have to say is that I was pleasantly surprised and relieved that I finally had the opportunity to see these films. Without a doubt, the first was my favorite, the second was my second favorite, and the third worked, but it didn't work as well as the other two movies. Part three worked the same formulas from the first and second, but some of the situations just seemed a tad too unrealistic.Marty and The Doc are now in the Wild Wild West way back in 1885, and as you know the tools are not quite advanced as they are in 1985, so they have to figure out the best they can on how to get back to the future. But Doc falls in love with a woman he saves from going over a cliff, Clara, and Marty has been challenged by Mad Dog, or Biff in a different generation, to a duel. This is a major problem since Marty found a tombstone in the future with a possibility of having either his or Doc's name on it.Well, I'm really glad that I had the opportunity to see these Back to the Future films, because they were good movies. I have to say that I was wrong, I tried to stay away from these films, I'll admit, because it just seemed so hokey and not my type of movie, but I think that's a major problem we all need to work on and not be so judgmental before we typecast a movie that we think we won't like because we might end up with little treasures.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Doc Falls in Love,"""Back to the Future Part III"" is the conclusion of a top ten trilogy. Truthfully, not many trilogies are even good---I don't even know if I can list ten good trilogies. But if I could, BTTF would be in that top ten.In part one we got a taste of 1955. In part two the majority of the time was spent in 2015. Part three is in 1885. Marty McFly (MJ Fox) goes back to 1885 in order to save Doc's life. When things go wrong with the Delorean that creates problems and of course Marty will have to contend with another version of Biff. Things are further complicated when Doc (Christopher Lloyd) falls in love with Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen). It's more action and adventure in a different era for Marty and Doc.The lure and mystique that the first BTTF had is dulled being that this is the third installment, but it's still and adequate movie. I'll tell you one thing: For Doc to care so much about it he sure does trample all over the space-time continuum. In for a penny, in for a pound I guess.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back to the Future Part 3,"Other than Doctor Emmett Brown's character development, and it having some relevance to the previous films, it's pretty fair to say Back to the Future Part 3, was a cash grab. The concept is pretty strung on, with a story pulled out of left field, to keep the series going for one more round. Part 3 was supposed to be apart of Part 2, but they figured with the duration, and content, they had two films on their hands. Maybe because I'm not the biggest western guy, but other than Part 3 being the funniest of the bunch, it didn't pack the punch the other films did. The story may come off a little light, but Part 3 finds it's footing, coming off a jumbled Part 2. Zemeckis, Spielberg & Gale didn't add as much time traveling, keeping the narrative focused, like the first.Michael J. Fox continues his bold, yet charming role, but he didn't have much character development, due to the fact that he didn't have much to do in this film. The standout of the film was Doc! He got the most screen time as of yet, getting some interesting pieces added to his character. The greatest thing about this film, was the chemistry Fox & Llyod built over this short, five year span. Mary Steenburgen was a rare pleasure of someone who plays a sudden love for a main character. Clara was a great compliment to Doctor Brown, helping expand his character. Thomas F. Wilson returns once again, to be our antagonist, but his role is pretty outplayed already.The screenplay by Robert Zemeckis & Bob Gale, had the same charm, and familiar lines from the films prior. With the western spin on it, it helped make this film the funniest out of the trilogy.The production design by Rick Carter, who also did the design for Back to the Future Part 2, looked great, while really capturing that western feel. Part 3 was less reliant on the effects, other than the time travel scenes, really. The costume design by Joanna Johnston & Chuck Velasco had that great western feel, but the costumes stood too clean, for a dirty, dusty film.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"The Conclusion Of A Trilogy That Is Sheer Fun, Excitement & Energy","Marty and doc are back, but in another time. They go to the West in 1885 in order to save Doc's life and from then on the Western adventure takes place. It's a pity that so many people disliked the third movie because, in my humble opinion, it's a great finale to this fantastic trilogy. It is very well written with rich characters and clever dialogues. This third part does differ in the sense that it's set in the West and has less of the futuristic gadgets and gizmos (obviously, since it's not set in the distant future but you'll still see a few including a time-travelling freight train) but it still retains the same energy, a different kind of action and it pays a nice homage to Western classics. Fox and Lloyd continue their roles of the teen hero and the crazy doctor (and it never gets old) but this time there's a new female lead. Mary Steenburgen delivers a hilariously wonderful performance as the ditsy Clara. She and Lloyd are funny and sweet together. Clara is the perfect lady for Doc and Steenburgen fits the part like a glove. This time, Lea Thompson appears as an Irish settler. Zemeckis has brilliantly picked up from where the second one ended. The film ends on a delightful note and I would have liked to see more 'Back to The Future' movies. But, I'm still very pleased with the way it is. There have been only very few trilogies that have impressed me overall. My list includes names like Ray's 'Apu Trilogy' and Coppola's 'Godfather' trilogy and of course Zemeckis's 'Back To The Future' movies.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Great conclusion to Back to the Future series!,"The second and final sequel to one of the most iconic movies in cinematic history closes the series out with a bang, where Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) journeys to the year 1885 to save Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (Christopher Lloyd) from a fatal duel with Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson). This is also Marty's last chance to travel back to his own time with no more time interference.The special effects team really did an awesome job in making the time travel elements seem spectacular but realistic-looking, especially the DeLorean, and the cinematography of the Old Wild West was detailed and captures the 1800s feel very well.Just like the first two movies, the direction by Robert Zemeckis was well-paced from start to finish, making the film intriguing throughout, from Marty meeting his ancestors in the old west to Doc meeting schoolteacher Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen). Their sudden love-at-first-sight attraction complicates the travel travel plans of Marty, adding suspense to the film. And, Marty skirmishing with Tanner is just entertaining to watch.Spot-on acting by Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Mary Steenbrugen, Thomas F. Wilson and Lea Thompson. They all made the film engaging and I especially liked their portrayals of old wild west people. The romantic subplot slows the story's pacing down a bit, but the race against time plot makes this sequel another edge-of-your-seat experience and is a great conclusion to the Back to the Future series.Grade A-",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Robert Zemeckis' Back To The Future rocks !,"When I first saw Back To The Future part 2, I was really looking forward to see the third part because it's the exact sequel of the second. In fact, Back To The Future part 2 has no end in itself. You have to see the last part of the trilogy to know the end of the adventure. That's why I saw the third part just after the second =D.In this movie the main character, the young Marty McFly (Michael J.Fox), has to go back to 1885 in order to find his long-time friend and eminent scientist Emmett Brown. Doc has been accidentally sent to the old Far West at the end of the second movie and this film tells Marty's journey to find his friend and go back to the present.I am really fond of the first two movies so I had a little apprehension about this one. I was afraid I might be bored or disappointed. But this is a really good film too. The universe is kind of different because the action takes place a century before so it isn't boring at all. Moreover, even if the characters are involved in a cowboys story, they're still themselves and I am still crazy about them. They fit perfectly in their role and, as in the other movies, Marty meets some people of his family. He meets some bad guys too, and the worst is part of Biff Tannen's family, as usual.My favorite scene happens at the end, just before Marty and Doc finally go back home. They really are in trouble because Buff Tannen, Biff's ancestor, wants to shoot them and Marty uses a trick he learned in the previous movie. I like this sort of links between the parts of the trilogy very much.I really love this movie and I would recommend it to anyone who saw the first ones. Not only is the plot as good and funny as usual, but there has been a really good effort in the camera-work to make the film look like a classic western.This is really a cult movie in the Sci-Fi world and in my opinion, it's a shame there haven't been other sequels.

Clint Eastwood is a no good yellow coward,"While this final installment of the film series does not have quite the kick of the first film, it does tie things together in a nice bow. In order to enjoy these films, your senses of time and of flight have to be a little strange anyhow.Mary SturgenBerger heads a fine cast of support in moving the series into the old west. Even Pat Buttrum shows up in a limited support role. The film is still carried by Christopher Lloyd & Michael J Fox but they are supported by a solid cast and a storyline which makes use of every talent in the film.It is a credit to Clint Eastwood that he is secure enough in his life to allow his name to be used for some tung in cheek humor here. A film sequence of Eastwoods shows up in Part 2 so it is entirely logical for him to show up here including the reuse of the sequence in the second film in this movie.The effects people go to town here working on the railroad. The opening sequence at the 1950's style drive in theater is a clever setting too. Visually this film is very well done. This film is the longest in the series and almost gets too long, but it has to be to develop a story which supposedly ends this saga once and for all.It does leave one opening, a story with Doc Browns time traveling kids. Some clever use of naming them after a science fiction author leaves open a plot line using them as a basis. I doubt that they intend to do such a film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A must see!,"I think this movie makes a great end for the Back To The Future trilogy. I didn't think that I would like it much because it was about the old west, but I loved it! Michael J.

I'd really like to find out what happens to all the characters years later. But overall, an awesome film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Future bright,"My big mistake watching this film was seeing it out of sequence. I'm sure I saw B.T.T.F.1 on its original release, but don't remember catching numbers 2 & 3 when they first came out. So maybe I should have held off viewing this, the final episode in Marty & the Doc's time-travelling adventures, but if I lopped off the framing elements at the beginning and of this the third feature, it was still easy to enjoy this typically bright, humorous and action- packed Robert Zemeckis film.This time, to prevent the Doc's death in a past-life, our intrepid heroes have to double- back in time (with thanks to ZZ Top) to the old West to fix the time-line and still find a way back to their own time, a tricky task given that the DeLorean gets damaged en-route. Along the way, Marty meets his forebears and the Doc falls in love, the climax of the western section being a high noon showdown between Marty and a demonised Biff, before the expected race against time for Marty and the tying up of loose ends epilogue.I liked the film a lot, like the runaway train at the end it picks up speed as it goes and even if Zemeckis does pile on the climaxes a bit, it entertains all the way. As before, Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd pal about well together, while Mary Steenbergen is a welcome newcomer as Lloyd's surprise love-interest. The special effects don't always quite come off, but there are some neat humorous touches, like when Marty and the Doc exchange catch-phrases and especially Marty's preferred post-breakfast gunfighting preference. Marty's back-story about meeting his great-great grandparents is weakened by him having clumsily play both parts but otherwise this was a good-natured, matinée-adventure fun movie.

From one to three,"I call The Back to the Future movies a trilogy set that was something a lot like the original ""Star Wars"" movies, and they made ""Back to the Future Part III"" a great part in all of this. ""Back to the Future Part III"" was practically an old-west situation with a good amount of science-fiction and humor through the whole thing.Through all of this, you're expecting to see someone get shot and killed in the old west, yet Marty is constantly beating the bad guys. I especially like the ending in the old-west, where Marty has everyone thinking he has been shot and killed by Biff Tannen, then he gets up and simply beats him up having him unconscious, disgusted, and even inadvertently helps with Tannen's arrest. This is a dream for nearly everyone to do to a bully at some point.Watch the whole set of ""Back to the Future"" movies side by side and you will find all of them, fun and amusing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
One of the Rare Brilliant Closings to an Amazing Saga,"With this passing month, I have seen all three ""Back to the Future"" films for the very first time in my life. Now, I have seen many tiny pieces (I believe everyone has), enough to the point that if another film or show references ""Back to the Future"", I completely catch it. I must say, however, that there are very few trilogies on the planet that add up to such mesmerizing films as these. There are only four trilogies I love, and the list goes along like this: ""The Lord of the Rings"", the original ""Star Wars"" films, all three of ""The Matrix"" films, and now this. Believe me, readers: you will never find something as excellent as these three films about the curiosity of time travel being invented. I must admit that I was quite reluctant by the trailer for this film at the end of ""Back to the Future: Part II"", but I admire this one to an extent that surpasses the second film by far.For this third chapter in the saga, Marty McFly heads back in time to pick-up the Doc. At the moment, the Doc is trapped in a western time period, thus forcing Marty to create a new identity; Clint Eastwood. That's right. For the third time in the series, Marty and Doc must head back to the future . . .The first noteworthy thing to tell you is that this film may also be one of the greatest science-fiction AND western films ever created. It was definitely a brilliant idea to carry the story to the past this time round; otherwise, ""Part III"" could have been a failed re-treading of the first two ""Back to the Future"" films.The acting in this film is--simply put--heartfelt and endearing. The audience could swear that all three films were shot back-to-back, and that adds so much more to the series. We have also acquired the same charm of humor and action blended that the prior films had presented us with. There is not one single performance in the entire film that is lackluster; all of these actors shine brightly in these roles, much as they always did previously.The writing of dialogue and action setpieces in the film are so enveloping and epic, especially towards the close of the film. It's extraordinary in so many ways. I think the most appealing thing about the film is how it self-references itself continuously throughout the films. Self-referencing, as I stated earlier, is very charming, and it makes the audience feel so much more at home with the tale and characters. This film gives us a well-executed message about life, and I think this is one point of a plus that makes the film so joyful and welcoming. This film, besides being set in the past (nearly a hundred years before the eighties, to be exact), is more about our individual futures as human beings. This idea, in turn, is so very rare to see in filmography that you cannot help but praise the film with applause. Phenomenal.One very shocking revelation is the set itself: it looks like a real town in REAL western time periods. I actually had a double-take at how detailed some props and areas looked in the film. It is absolutely beautiful, especially when we see the many mountain ranges of this desert.As always, the soundtrack adds a childhood feeling to the film; that feeling you get when you are so familiar with a certain object that it brings this deep joy and empathy to your heart.With one last major compliment in the film's favor, I have to mention that when the film closed, I had the biggest smile on my face than I have had in quite a while. It is the kind of smile I believe everyone gets at the end of ""Star Wars"", or ""The Lord of the Rings"", or ""It's a Wonderful Life"". This film deserves every title of excellency it has received over the many years since its release.My rating for ""Back to the Future: Part III"" is a nine-out-of-ten stars.Merry Christmas, and God bless!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
They Saved the West for Last,"It seems that a lot of people rate Part III quite low, even those who like the underrated Part II. This may be because the break-neck pace of Part II is gone and this last entry mellows out and takes its time to develop its own story while also fully resolving the huge 130-year adventure of the entire trilogy. If it were a 90-minute cash-in I would understand why some people are indifferent towards Part III, but it's so much more than that.You could argue that Part III is almost a remake of the first movie. In several ways this is true, but it also has the appeal that makes the first so endearing. Instead of being nostalgic for the naive 80s or innocent 50s, Part III makes us long for the wide-open spaces of the old west, when the US was still in its infancy, before skyscrapers, shopping malls, and Starbucks lined every horizon. A time when there was still real freedom. But with freedom comes anarchy, this time taking the form of Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen - fastest gun in the west.I will admit that there is a noticeable lack of excitement as Doc romances Clara Clayton which goes against the ever-escalating disaster suspense of the series and might not interest viewers who are not keen period love stories. The action and adventure takes a back seat here while romance, comedy, and clever plotting get their own space. On the flipside Alan Silvestri delivers his most exciting score for the series, fusing the BTTF theme with a rousing western melody which is especially fun during the climax on the train. Plus, it's always fun to see 1955 Doc, who I always thought was more eccentric and closer to insanity than his older counterpart.We also get to see the ""birth"" of the clock tower which is a nice counterpoint to it's ""death"" in the first movie. Part III also opens with the brilliant lightning strike and Doc's rudely interrupted celebration, which is just awesome.Yes, it does have its shortcomings, I won't deny that. Why doesn't Doc just syphon the gasoline from the DeLorean he came to 1885 in? It would save them the effort of hijacking a train. But I am being pedantic again. I always felt that Part III was a definitive and fitting end to the series and I never thought that a Part IV would be necessary. There is not ""To Be Concluded/Continued"", there is only ""The End"" and it makes perfect sense that it should be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Ruined the first two,"Okay so I only gave this one kind of a low score because I felt like it ruined the first two films in the series which were very good on their own. I liked how the second film ended which sort of leads into this one but couldn't they have come up with something else. You may not think I'm being fair but that's how it is. So maybe it's not that bad of a movie if you were to judge it all on its own and it could be decent if you just stumbled onto it on tv when you can't sleep and you're looking for something to watch, but just knowing that the other two films are out there and so great this is not a worthy sequel.

The most fun of the three.,"Part III, the wild west entry, is probably the most fun. The original has just such a fantastic premise that creates a sense of urgency about seeing it out till the end, but there is something uncomfortable about your mother having a crush on you that leaves a bad taste in the mouth during Part I. The premise of Part III is this: in 1955, Doc learns that he will eventually travel back to 1885 to live out his days as a blacksmith, but then Copernicus, Doc's 1955 dog, stumbles upon a gravestone that tells Doc and Marty that Doc will be shot to death by Buford Tannen over a matter of 80 dollars. Naturally, Marty says he will travel back to 1885 and get Doc and bring him back to the future with him (though it couldn't be 1955, because there's already one Doc there).There are time-jumping laws that are not obeyed by the scriptwriters here, and much worse than in the second film, but this one's so well concentrated and so much the better movie that they hardly matter. It has a climax involving a train that rivals the clocktower climax of the first one. A fantastic scene.Thomas F Wilson, the perennial bad guy of these movies, who started off as Biff Tannen in the original, played Griff Tannen in the second one, throws himself into a Yosemite Sam part as Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen in the third. Mary Steenbergen, in one of her few leading roles, is a nice addition to the cast. She fits right into the wild west world, as the dainty schoolteacher who plays ""his beloved Clara"" to the Doc.Like the others, its larger-than-life tone, with the over-blown time-travel dialogue and melodramatic highs and lows, render it into a kind of live-action cartoon. Kids will enjoy Part III the most, but it is so good-natured that adults should have fun with it too. Out of the three, this is the one that you'll be able to put on any time and feel good. Great, harmless fun.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Worse of the Trilogy,"Stranded in 1955, Marty McFly receives written word from his friend, Doctor Emmett Brown, as to where can be found the DeLorean time machine. However, an unfortunate discovery prompts Marty to go to his friend's aid. Using the time machine, Marty travels to the old west where his friend has run afoul of a gang of thugs and has fallen in love with a local schoolteacher. Using the technology from the time, Marty and Emmett devise one last chance to send the two of them back to the future.Okay, after setting the bar way too high from the second film, I thought I would see the same over-complicated time travel movie. However, I was wrong. In fact, this movie is more laid back. There's no time limit (well, there is). But it's mostly lackluster if you expect something big (excluding the last twenty minutes).In this film, there is no jumping back and forth with oh so complicated situations like the second. The characters just stay in one place to solve one problem. There isn't as much fun in here as I expected. There are still some laughs but not as much as the last two.Even as the conclusion of the trilogy, Robert Zemeckis couldn't create a good (or unique) enough story to continue with. Basically, if you think this movie is much grander and bigger, you'll be disappointed. All you'll get is a lackluster conclusion. At least you have some fun.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Perfect conclusion,"What a perfect conclusion to an incredible trilogy. Back to the Future III is, in my opinion, all you could ask for. It's funny, it's lighthearted and it gives the viewer what I consider to be an extremely satisfying ending.I think I have seen this one about ten years ago and to be completely honest, I couldn't remember a thing. The only thing I thought I remembered, was that this one wasn't as good as the two previous films. However, having now watched all of them back to back, I thought that this third and final installment was fantastic.
By far, the best thing about this movie is the third act. It's tense, it's action-packed, and above all else, it is incredibly satisfying. To put it simply, I was grinning like an idiot for the last 30 minutes.This has to be one of the best and most fun movie trilogies ever. Each part provides something new and exciting and keeps you engaged. The only thing that I hope, is that there will never be any sequels (or God forbid remakes) of these movies.

Fitting last chapter,"Marty gets to 1885 to save Doc, but they may be stuck there and the clock is ticking on getting back. This one does follow the other two, but it doesn't relate that directly to them(except for tying up loose ends Part II left for it so it'd have *something*), other than referencing the first one somewhat(much less than the second did). It's not at a high school comedy, nor a carefully written homage to the original, it's a Western adventure with time travel. The core concept remains the same, if messing up the time-line seems less dangerous this time around(and in general it doesn't feel as exciting as the others). The focus is on Emmett now, and with little story left to tell, they give him a love interest. Tannen remains the villain, and is the only one left to really overact(except for Lloyd, the mug-master), not to mention one of the only to return. We do get the trilogy treatment, with this returning to the roots and revealing information we didn't know before and a sense of closure. The humor is again pretty silly, in fact maybe moreso than earlier. As a period piece, it really works, you believe that you're seeing early US. I recommend this to fans of the franchise. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
The holy trilogy goes out with a bang,"It's a tall order for a third movie to not only bring the series to a tidy conclusion, but to follow up the hectic tone of the previous entry. But ""Back to the Future Part III"" does both, and a great job no less. What's cool about this is that, even though the pacing and tone are more relaxed (fitting the Old West setting), it's still a tight script. I don't tend to look at the clock during this movie, and that says a lot.Also, this is Doc's story, and it's a great change of pace to finally see him a little more front-and-center. I have to admit, his intro in this movie is also pretty badass. And Steenburgen's nod to ""Time After Time"" is a treat.""Part III"" is a great resolution to the series, tying up all the loose threads and bringing things to an end with a nice dose of character. This could've gone sideways (one wrong move, and you'll wind up with a ""Godfather Part III""), but it never does, and makes for one hell of a finish to the trilogy.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A worthy climax to a fine trilogy,"While it doesn't have quite the same ingenuity and vitality that made the first two parts such great entertainment, the third and final part of the excellent Back to the Future trilogy still offers two hours of solid entertainment. The first part saw our heroes go back into the past slightly, and the second part saw us travel into the future; so to be different, this one finds us massively in the past, in the great Wild West. What follows is a mixture of various western tributes (some of which are blatantly obvious, others less so) combined with a fun, if slightly predictable, plot line. Marty McFly has had to travel back to 1885 in order to save Doc Brown, whom Marty has discovered will die on Monday if he doesn't do something about it. With the space time continuum in disarray, Marty must struggle to save Doc Brown from a notorious gunman known as MadDog (who looks suspiciously like Biff from the other two films) while also making sure that he doesn't change anything as it will have serious repercussions on his future. That's the future from 1985 onwards, not the 1895 one. I think.For a trilogy of films predominantly aimed at children, this has one hell of a confusing plot. Luckily, however, through tight scripting and a nice plot pace; Robert Zemeckis tells his story well, and even if you're not sure of the plot line on the whole, it's always obvious what's immediately going on. The film features a number of nice set-pieces (much like the other two) and there honestly isn't a moment of down time in the entire film (or trilogy, for that matter). As you might expect, the best set-piece has saved until the end; and the train chase climax blends tension, suspense and humour to ensure that the film ends on a high. The characters are well done and entertaining throughout, and both the leads; Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd were born to play the roles that they play in this film. Both have made other movies, but neither one has even come close to being as memorable as they are here; and that reinforces my point. On the whole, this is a worthy climax to a very fine trilogy and it should please everyone who sees it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
An Indulgent Threequel That Never Quite Arrives,"This is the point where the dam breaks for the BTTF trilogy. Without the innocent, loose grasp of reality present in the first film, nor the amusing, campy glimpses of the future seen in the second, there's really not all that much to look forward to as this bad western lolls its way toward the finish line. Marty McFly and Doc Brown still make for strong core characters, ones we desperately want to see come out ahead, but they've got their arms full here with a stale set of recurring gags, a base premise that's thin at best and a hammy love story that doesn't really bring anything meaningful to the table. Where the original was able to effortlessly skirt the holes that speckled its plot, the saga's grand finale bowls straight through them with no regard for the repercussions, leaving audiences skeptical. A needless leap across both genre and era, at least it has the dignity to close the door behind it when the credits queue.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Tremendous fun and a worthy concluding instalment to a great trilogy,"I loved the first film, and while a step down I enjoyed the second as well. The third film is tremendous fun from start to finish, and contrary to what the other reviewers say I prefer this over the second. Yes the storyline is mediocre in places, but Doc's romance was touching and the steam-train finale was phenomenally staged. The film is set in the Old West and gives the stars a chance to revel in the situations that made the matinée western serials such a delight for so many people. The script is as witty and clever as the ones in the first two films, the direction is once again excellent and I loved the casting of the old western favourites such as Harry Carey Jnr and Pat Buttram. And as always Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd are on cracking form as Marty and Doc.

Wonderful conclusion to a trilogy that really has given us everything,"After the Doc is sent back to the old west Marty (Fox) finds the 1955 Doc for help to travel to 1885 to save his future self from assassination.The third and final instalment to the time travelling trilogy brings around a western adventure for the coolest time traveller of all Marty McFly as he attempts to save the Doc's life.In 1985 back to the future brought around a sensational new concept of travelling back and forth and altering past events and with the coolest car on the market was a worldwide smash and rightly so. And only being 2 when this was released, I feel I missed the appreciation to the climax of a truly brilliant series.Still praised to this very day the conclusion has more action, drama and adventure than the previous two parts and adapting a western styled genre gives the series diversity whilst still maintaining a powerful segment devoted to science.As Marty and the Doc contemplate returning back to the present in 1985 numerous factors arise to cause problems for their future. Mad Dog wants their lives whilst a love interest for the Doc appears, deflecting his attention from the present as he contemplates his own future.Having focused purposefully on Marty's family for the previous two films it was a nice gesture to focus in more on the doc's life and outlook and as a result this feels more rewarding and the entire trilogy benefits from spreading its emotions through its main players. Even Tannen has some purposeful and meaningful dialogue in this script which is also beneficial as the film winds up.Encoding more action sequences than ever Part III adds the intensity and power to give the western scenes extra spice. From shoot outs to a splendid train/car experiment this feels none stop and your heart will pump for more, yet sadly the fun and adventure had to finish somewhere and is the case with life, it is always good to go out on a high.Michael J Fox once more generates a slick styled protagonist with his clever mimics of Clint somebody and though the first costume design is far-fetched he somehow carries it off. Lloyd's Doc is once more exceptionally intelligent and knowledgeable and having extra dialogue and on screen time we see a more human side to his personality.This trilogy reinvented the concept of travelling through time with a complex intent but never degrading the audience with its basic yet eccentric styled discourse and with such superb characters and intent of action with humour this trilogy has astounded many and will do for all of time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A Fitting Conclusion To The Adventures of Doc & Marty,"The third & final instalment in Back to the Future Trilogy, Part III is by all means a much welcome improvement over Part II, and manages to regain the fresh vibe & riveting quality of the original by bringing the delights of a different genre into its sci-fi premise. Picking up from the cliffhanging ending of its muddled predecessor, it is closer in tone to the first film and concludes the trilogy on a satisfying note.Directed by Robert Zemeckis, the film takes Marty & Doc further than ever before and features a better structured & more refined storyline with a finale that brings the journey full circle. Although there are a few empty stretches in the middle, its Old West setting, homages to western classics & deft use of humour derived from merging the two contrasting genres results in an entry that feels new yet familiar.The time-travel antics are as fun as before while the century old timeline actually suits the story more than the poorly rendered vision of the future. The finale also unravels with same thrilling, nail-biting intensity as the climax of the first feature. And detailed set pieces, dynamic camerawork, steady pace, deftly choreographed action & excellent performances from the cast keep the adventurous aura alive n kicking.Overall, Back to the Future Part III is a fitting conclusion to the adventures of Doc & Marty, and aptly ties up all the loose ends before turning off the lights. The last scene does feel unnecessary to the equation but its presence does not undermine the emotional impact of what occurred before by much. It's pretty much the same ending either way. Expertly crafted, intelligently told & finely acted, Part III wraps up the Back to the Future saga on a memorable note.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Zippy, snappy and thoroughly enjoyable second sequel which reminds us of how good American produced/English-language franchises can be.","I think we'd all be lying if we said we didn't sit through the final few shots of Back to the Future: Part III and didn't necessarily 'feel' something sad or melancholy wash over us. The conclusion to what has to go down as one of the best film trilogies of all time, a sentiment made even more prominent following recent additions to the respective Terminator and Die Hard franchises, carries with it an uplifting air of pomp and conclusion juxtaposed with a sense of heartbreak in that the only way to experience time travelling adventures with these characters, whom we love a great deal, is to sit through a rerun. There is genuine heart to proceedings here, and we sense the director, a certain Robert Zemeckis, of whom has been responsible for some great work over the years, is genuinely trying new things and attempting to push the franchise down different routes. What isn't happening is what often occurs with certain other sequels belonging to certain other franchises; that is to say, simulacrum-imbued romps of previous entries following that same lead character, of whom was never particularly interesting in the first place, trudging through the same locations and doing the same act with nothing registering and not much of it particularly interesting.The film continues the adventures of Marty McFly, but it veers more away to his faithful partner in time, Emmett ""Doc"" Brown, in the fashion the last entry alluded it would: Doc's favourite ever era in history was ""the old West"", while at one point in Part II, he stated his intent to dismantle the confounded time machine built out of a Delorean and focus his attentions on the ""one other mystery of the universe: women(!)"". We begin in 1955, and following events of the second film, Marty crash-lands back into Doc Brown's world; he of whom is only just recovering from the events of the very first film. Marty still has that letter from the end of Part II, a letter addressed to him from Doc although written in 1885 having spent several decades with a courier company. It's worth pointing out that the incarnation of Doc that is trapped in 1885 is he of the year 1985, and as you watch and struggle to sync it all up to see if it makes sense, one must battle the wave of nostalgia washing over one on top of listening and working it all out. Blowing up the entrance to an old mine near a graveyard, so that Marty may travel back to the 80's, they stumble across no ordinary grave: Doc's grave from the nineteenth century, and they take it upon themselves to alter the plan by sending Marty back to save him.When Marty arrives back, it is as magical as it is when he respectively crash lands into both the 50's and the 2010's; that trademark-of-the-series crane shot over the town-general is like a friend of old rearing up after not having previously seen them for several years, whilst the gag about encountering his ""mother"" (or a descendant of his mother) very early on after travelling is still funny. Initially, Marty struggles; falling afoul of his untamed Western surroundings by very nearly coming a cropper to the local wildlife, natives and the soiled water a nearby rancher gives him. There is some early, if unwelcome, instances of humour revolving around a baby urinating on him and his treading in horse manure, but the general idea is he's ill-suited to his surroundings. The Tannen's are back, Thomas F. Wilson returns as an incarnation of what is arguably the most famous school bully that's ever been put to film; here playing Buford, an ancestor of Biff and Griff et al. and a gunslinger whose reputation is built up through still images and newspaper reports prior to his arrival on screen. When he does arrive, the first we see of him is his holstered pistol filling the screen as he walks through a saloon door, thus inferring the danger and the sense of conflict synonymous with him.Where it is established Doc has but a few days left to live, complications in their plan to save both of them arises when Clara Clayton (Steenburgen) bursts onto the scene; a woman destined by history to perish over the side of a cliff but saved by Doc, in what is an event which alters both history as well as Doc's life. Their coming together is the aforementioned wholesome substance, while providing with Doc with as much of the limelight as McFly is good value. Back to the Future: Part III works through its sense of there constantly being something at stake - we are aware of what the characters have to do, that is to say, something wholly scientific that is yet to have been tried which unfolds in a pre-modern era. If we look back upon this third Back to the Future film, and to a degree the second one as well, with a differing sense of fondness, then it is because that sense of the fire still going as a mainstream franchise hits its third film has all but dissipated from series of the more recent times. We enjoy the places the film take us; specifically, its covering of two people coming to form a relationship away from the core dynamic of McFly and Doc - if there were criticisms directed at the second film for thrashing around too much as it travelled and darted through time, then this is the entry that is grounded in one place and burns slowly as two characters come together and connect. As a result, we are required to hark back to films such as these made at a time when you actually felt filmmakers were trying new things and were out to enthrall as well as touch emotions, rather than proceed with a going through of the motions.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Surprisingly Good!,"Usually these kind of movies don't fare well with critics, the audience, and the box office. I feel that this film had success in all these categories. I certainly felt this is a good way to end a classic series.This time, Marty McFly travels back to 1888 to rescue Doc. If Doc is not rescued, he will perish and history may be altered in one way or another.The acting is pretty good. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd basically did as well as they did in the first two. Mary Steenburgen was a nice addition. It added some romance to the film.Now, the important thing is that this film is not as good as the first two films. Well, the plot/characters/acting/music are, but it did not give me the feel as I would normally feel while watching a classic.Overall, this is a grand finale to a great series. I would pick this movie as the best one. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Second best of the series,"Sure, it was unnecessary and unneeded, but this film was still a great movie to watch.

Perfect Ending to a Perfect Franchise,"The first movie, Back to the Future, had successfully blended Sci-Fi and high school drama to give us a heart-warming little tale. This movie does an equally good job of taking Sci-Fi to the wild west. The previous movie had ended with Doc being accidentally transported to 1985. Marty takes the help of 1955-Doc again, to bring 1985-Doc back to the present day(1985).What follows is a fun-filled adventure. Marty meets his ancestors. Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen, an ancestor of Biff's, is a dreaded outlaw. A forefather of Principal Strickland is the town Marshal. There are gunfights, duels, Indians, Fedoras, chasing trains on horses, rescuing of a damsel and romance.The film pays tribute to the great westerns of the past. Marty adopts the name Clint Eastwood when he meets his ancestors. Like in some of the classic westerns, this film too has the plot-line where an outsider (time-traveler in this case) comes to a lawless town and teaches them, by setting a example, that violence is no good.The trilogy on the whole does a great job with time-travelling and alternate time-lines. There are a total of fifteen known time-journeys, three alternate 1885's, four alternate 1955's, four alternate 1985's, one 2015 we see and one which is yet to be made and zero plot-holes, in all the three films combined. What makes it even more special is that none of it is complicated. That is how story-telling ought to be.It is a one-of-a-kind time-travel trilogy. A must watch for film aficionados and casual movie-watchers alike.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Weakest in the trilogy.,"I didn't care to much for this one. I found it weak bland and boring.

"there are fine individual moments and ideas here, but Part III is crippled by an unnecessary love story and lack of  initiative and zest that induced the first two movies","Seeing as how the science-fiction and the Western are my favorite genres, one would expect ""Back to the Future: Part III"" to be my personal favorite of the entire trilogy directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd. It has some very fine moments and some great ideas in its form, but unfortunately, ""Part III"" comes across as being the weakest of the entire trilogy for a variety of reasons, but mostly because it lacks the zest and gusto that so wonderfully induced the first two movies.After Doc (Christopher Lloyd) is accidentally whisked back to 1885, Marty (Michael J. Fox) discovers the flux capicator-inhibited DeLorean buried in Hill Valley's soil, buried by the Doc years ago before he was murdered by a notorious gunfighter (Thomas Wilson). Marty recovers the DeLorean and travels back to the Old West to rescue Doc, who has become smitten with a frantic schoolmarm (Mary Steenburgen), who was supposed to have died until they interfered.I think you can see what my first real complaint about ""Part III"" is. I suppose it was only a matter of time before the screenwriters made the mistake of throwing in a sappy love story for Doc when one was anything but necessary. The first two movies dealt with their romantic subplots with care and tender brilliance, but best of all, they strayed away from Doc. This character needed anything but a love interest. The romantic subplot is sappy, boring, uninteresting, and makes one roll one's eyes and look toward his watch, begging Zemeckis to move along with the more interesting stuff. And also, I'm sorry to say, Christopher Lloyd and Mary Steenburgen are a very awkward screen couple.""Part III"" also suffers because it simply does not have the same inexorable timing and suspense that made the first two movies so magical. Instead of whipping along, it plods along like a man dying in the heat of the sun. And the climax, which is once again drawn-out with suspense intended to build, comes across as dull and routine with tensions everywhere but on the rise. There is also, I'm sorry to say, a lot of hokey dialogue in the screenplay.Now, however, there *are* some good elements to ""Part III."" In fact, some of them are brilliant. The idea of Marty assuming the name of Clint Eastwood in the Old West is a fantastic idea and the obvious homage to the climax of ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is fun and smile-inducing. Performances are once again good. Michael J. Fox's performance is buttoned up and solid; Lloyd is funny when he's not being sappy as Doc; Thomas Wilson is once again sinister and convincing; Mary Steenburg turns out a solid, if whimsical performance, as the schoolmarm; and there are a lot of fun Western cameos by names such as Pat Buttram and Harry Carey, Jr. who can be seen playing poker in the saloon that plays prominently in the movie. All of these good, fun elements do save the movie from being a complete failure, but unfortunately they also make your heart sink as you realize that the rest of the movie falls short of them.Perhaps the change of direction was the fatal flaw of ""Back to the Future: Part III."" Perhaps the blend of the Western and science-fiction genres was too patchy and whimsical for it to work. And maybe Robert Zemeckis and his crew were running out of steam with this franchise. In the end, ""Part III"" is not really a very bad movie, but it is uncharacteristically dull and dry for a Robert Zemeckis movie and unlike the first two movies, is rather forgettable save for its few brilliant elements.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A nice ending to one of my favorite trilogies,"This time McFly goes back to 1985 to save the Doc.It is my least favorite of the three movies but still very entertaining and a great ending to the series.I will first say what makes me like this movie less than the other two. It is mainly because in the first two movies I liked the interaction of him with his family and how it affects the present. This is missing in the second part. We still get to see his ancestors and get the first McFly born in America pee on Marty, but it is very short. It is also less of a sci fi and more of a western. Which is also what makes it the favorite of the three for my father who loves westerns since he was a kid!.But aside from this the movie is very good. We still get to see a lot of Marty and the Doc. Doc even gets a little romance in this movie. Mary Steenburgen was great as Clara and they had a good chemistry. Biff's ancestor is of course the villain here and again he is on wonderful.

Back to the Future Part III was a fine way to end the series,"Yesterday, me and my movie theatre-working friend rewatched all three Back to the Future films for a one-time-only showing. Since the second one partially took place on October 21, 2015-that became the reason for that particular day's reshowing of them all. Anyway, this one focuses on Marty McFly's (Michael J. Fox) traveling to 1885 to search for his pal Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) who seemed to accidentally end up there at the end of the last one. Also, in this one, Doc falls for a teacher named Clara (Mary Steenburgen). Oh, and Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson return to play their character's ancestors. After the last one was almost devoid of laughs, this one has quite a bit of them with much of the touching sentiment mostly missing from the previous entry.

Back To The Future bows out in style,"After the unfortunately jumbled sequel, Back To The Future III takes a welcome change of direction. The Old West is a great setting for a new story and while the set and costumes do look a little cheap, this is still a very enjoyable movie with a great soundtrack.Introducing a love interest for Doc Brown was a risky but successful plot development. I've never been a big fan of Mary Steenburgen but her and Christopher Lloyd are very sweet in this film and have convincing on-screen chemistry.By the end of this movie you are definitely ready for it all to end. Many of the scenes are now highly repetitive ('Hey McFly!') and the characters have had all the juice squeezed out of them. The trilogy is wrapped up nicely with Marty's car crash redemption and Doc's happily-ever-after departure. A solid and satisfactory way to end a classic trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
What a phenomenal ending to a wonderful trilogy,"I just finished watching Back to the Future Part III (1990) for the first time ever and this movie was a satisfying way to close out the trilogy.Positives for Back to the Future Part III (1990):
It was cool to see our main characters continuing their time-traveling adventures during the western times. Having this movie set in the year 1885 is a nice change of setting for the trilogy, while also keeping the tone and approach from the previous two entries intact. It goes without saying that Michael J. Fox is still awesome as Marty McFly and he also does a fantastic job at playing Seamus McFly while also making that character stand out from Marty. Christopher Lloyd is once again very ecentric as Doc Brown and I appreciate that his character is allowed to get some development after the previous two movies. Then you have Mary Steenburgen as Clara Clayton who is fantastic addition to the trilogy and she has great chemistry with Christopher Lloyd. I can also say the same for Michael J. Fox as Seamus McFly and Lea Thompson as Maggie McFly. Then you have Thomas F. Wilson as Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen and he is just as despicable as this character like he was with Biff Tannen. There are some fantastic set pieces in this movie and they just as fun as they were in the previous two movies. And finally, I love the way with how this movie closes out the stories for all of these fantastic characters and this phenomenal trilogy.Overall, Back to the Future Part III (1990) is a perfect ending to this movie trilogy. This gave me everything that I wanted from the final chapter in the story with these characters and it makes the Back in the Future Trilogy as one of the greatest movie trilogies in the history of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
*Time Travel Meets the Wild West*,"In an era where sequels often fall short of their predecessors, ""Back to the Future Part III"" stands as a delightful testament to creativity and storytelling. Directed by Robert Zemeckis, this final installment in the iconic trilogy transports us not just through time, but also to the rugged landscapes of the Wild West, where the charm of 1950s nostalgia meets cowboy grit.The film opens with a somber note as Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) learns of Doc Brown's (Christopher Lloyd) plight in 1885. Driven by a sense of loyalty and adventure, Marty embarks on a journey to rescue his friend from a fate he cannot escape. The narrative expertly intertwines action, humor, and heartfelt moments, establishing a rich tapestry that captures the essence of friendship and the weight of choices made across time.One of the most captivating aspects of this film is how it revitalizes the western genre. From the dusty streets of Hill Valley in the 1880s to the classic standoffs and saloon brawls, the film pays homage to the spirit of westerns while infusing it with the trademark comedy and cleverness of the franchise. The characters, from the relentless outlaw Buford Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) to the spirited Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), offer a refreshing take on the archetypes of the genre.The film shines with its stunning visuals and captivating score, maintaining the high production values that the series is known for. The juxtaposition of the futuristic DeLorean against the backdrop of horse-drawn carriages sparks a nostalgic yet adventurous yearning for simpler times, all while cleverly commenting on progress and innovation.At its core, ""Back to the Future Part III"" delves into deeper themes of love, sacrifice, and the human experience. Doc's burgeoning romance with Clara and Marty's determination to save him highlight the lengths to which we go for those we care about. This emotional depth resonates with audiences of all ages, making the film not just a thrilling ride but a profound experience that lingers long after the credits roll.In the grand tapestry of film history, ""Back to the Future Part III"" is often overshadowed by its predecessors, but it stands as a unique and vital piece of the trilogy. It boldly steps into uncharted territory, blending genres and enriching its characters in a way that feels both fresh and familiar. With every twist and turn, it reminds us that while the past is a fascinating place to visit, it's the connections we forge and the adventures we embark upon that truly define our journeys through time.Overall, ""Back to the Future Part III"" is more than just a closing chapter; it's a celebration of creativity, friendship, and the complexities of love-an unforgettable ride that proves that whether in the past or the future, the spirit of adventure never dies.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

MY REVIEW: The Time Travel Adventure Ends So Well!!,"Back to the Future Part III. And then I was finished with one of the longest time travel fun ever. Starting from the point where Part I and Part II finished, Part III takes you this time to the old west era of 1885. You might think how many ideas they have up their sleeves to make us laugh, you will be surprised to see they have never run out of ideas while making this totally coherent screenplay that can be fit in three movies rather single one. Most of the laughter comes from how to make time machine work in the technically backward 1885. Michael and Christopher playing Marty and Doc respectively are still at their best. Dialogues like ""Great Scott"", ""That's heavy"" and ""I am back from the future"" remain with you. Doc's expressions whenever he hears about scientific innovation of future are priceless. His subtle love encounter is cute and lovable. I suggest you watch this trilogy in one go and I bet you must not have laughed so much for 6 long hours. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Back to the Future Part III. It ends but it ends so well that you will feel like that they have just started.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"It's not a terrible film, but it's a letdown compared to the first","It's fair to say that BACK TO THE FUTURE PART III is the third and least of the BACK TO THE FUTURE trilogy; it's merely an average Hollywood comedy adventure movie with sci-fi flourishes, while the first two films in the trilogy were bona fide classics.The problem with this film is that the science fiction material is really limited to just the first twenty minutes. For most of the running time, this film is merely an ordinary western adventure which seems happy to run through all of the clichés in the genre: there's the duel on the dusty screen, the gang of horse-riding villains, the showdowns in the saloon, the chases, and the unwanted romantic sub-plots. The inclusion of the Mary Steenburgen character was a particular reason I remember for disliking this film when I watched it as a kid.It's certainly not a bad film, although it seems worse when you compare it to the earlier films. Michael J. Fox remains good value even though he's only required to go through the motions this time, although Christopher Lloyd's acting goes beyond the boundaries of ham and becomes quite ridiculous. Still, at least the movie picks up for the extended train sequence at the climax, which doesn't disappoint and recaptures some of the old movie magic.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

The weakest of the series,"I loved the previous two volumes of this series. Especially the second one surprised me by being able to keep the quality at the same level as the first one. Unfortunately, the third one didn't impress me personally as much as the previous two films. This is probably due to the change of setting to a western, which I didn't enjoy as much. With the previous films I was entertained all the time, but here unfortunately I was a bit bored at times and mostly I felt that it was not worth it. I didn't have some huge sense of closure to the trilogy when it was over. Unfortunately. I'm just giving my opinion. I wasn't that interested in the third installment and didn't have as much fun with it. For me, the weakest part of the trilogy. The change to western didn't suit me and I didn't find the plot as interesting as the previous films. Despite all that, it was a good movie. It was.

Pleasant Closing to the Trilogy,"Back to the Future Part III was less confusing than Part II, but it also dispensed with most of the time travel paradoxes and mysteries that made the Parts I and II so intriguing.Set almost entirely in 1885 it picks up at the cliff-hanger ending of Part II with Doc Brown inadvertently sent to 1885, and Marty stuck in 1955.  The 1955 version of Doc Brown helps Marty return to 1885 to save Doc's life, and there the movie remains until the very end.I wish Part III had moved about in time more, and the 1885 version of Hill Valley not been so hokey, but I still heartily recommend Part III and the entire trilogy.  Part I is by far the best, and the only part that can be viewed by itself.

Think four-dimensionally!,"Seeing the surprise and originality factor had pretty much vanished entirely after the two first films, Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis were forced to come up with a slightly different approach for the finale of their hugely successful and ultimately entertaining time-traveling ""Back to the Future"" trilogy. They masterfully succeeded in this by drastically altering the time setting and by shifting the main emphasis towards Christoper Lloyd's character Doc instead of Marty. Number three takes Marty back to the Wild West in 1885, where Doc has settled himself in a small village after the DeLorean's short circuit in 1955. Doc had instructed Marty to return to his own time and let him remain in 1885, but upon discovering Doc's tombstone indicating a premature death, Marty travels back in time after all. With the DeLorean damaged beyond repair, they now both find themselves stuck in the Wild West and their attempts to find a solution are subsequently interrupted by Biff Tannen's criminal ancestor Buford and by the Doc himself falling in love with the charming school teacher Clara Clayton. The change in tone almost leads to this third film having its very own and independent personality. Those who endlessly claim that part three is the weakest and least memorable entry of the trilogy probably didn't yet realize that the source of paradox-jokes and situational humor was as good as exhausted after two films already. This film contains a different type of comedy, as it actually qualifies as a respectful Spaghetti Western satire (Marty imitates everything he learned about the Wild West from watching Clint Eastwood films) and a highly likable romantic comedy. And then still the die-hard fans of parts one and two have no actual reason to complain, since most of the characters re-appear as their own ancestors (like Michael J. Fox in a double role as the first McFly who entered America, the aforementioned malignant Buford Tannen and even Mr. Strickland as a late 19th Century lawman). The eventual return to 1985 is enormously spectacular and exciting, with the DeLorean being put on rails and pushed by a locomotive in order to reach 88 miles per hour, and the director's interpretation and re-creation of the Western period is prototypic but irresistibly charming, with raunchy saloons, unhygienic cowboys spitting around everywhere, a town's festival (with live performance by ZZ Top!) and the cavalry chasing after Indians. We already knew Michael J. Fox and Christoper Lloyd were ideally cast as Marty and Doc, but now also Mary Steenburgen gives away a stellar performance as the cute teacher and love-interest. ""Back to the Future Part III"" is a stupendous film and don't let anyone tell you otherwise!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
disappointing finale,"A fairly disappointing finale to the Back to the Future series. Being a big fan of the original I was interested how they would tie it all up. The film basically does two things to try and keep things fresh, firstly a return a change of location to the wild west and secondly introducing a love interest for Doc's character. The structure & some of the dialogue is nearly identical to the original, to the point it made me cringe at many times, I won't list all the things that were the same. The effect is the film does start to feel a bit repetitive & tired in places, as though they had found their formula and wouldn't change it. The original also tapped into the nostalgia of traveling back to 30 years ago, plenty of audience members from the 1980s could probably relate to and remember the 1950s. Obviously setting this film in the 1880s doesn't really have that same appeal. This isn't the real wild west either though of Red River and High Noon but a parody version. In the 1990s some real powerful westerns came out, Unforgiven, Tombstone, Dances with Wolves, in comparison this film just feels weak and whimsical.For me too there's also something a bit sad about seeing beloved characters age because the actors playing them have, both Elisabeth Shue & Michael J. Fox were approaching 30 when this came out but both are still meant to be the younger high school characters they were when the original was released. I'd have preferred if they could have matured the characters a little bit to catch up with the actors playing them.The fact that it made less money than either of it's predecessors was probably a sign it was the right time to end the franchise.The film has a few other flaws too, Marty must yell out everything he's thinking at every moment, Indians!, Cavalry! Bear! The Irish accents are not very good and there's really no point including these characters in the film, in the original Marty had to fix their relationship which was the heart of the film, no such luck here though, they're just kind of there. The jokes are also quite bad, Marty steps in horse dung, pee jokes, there's also so much that's unexplained like how is Marty suddenly such an expert horse rider? The love story is extremely cheesy too, it worked in the original because of the age of the characters you might believe they were that awkward and wide eyed but it doesn't work so well with the older characters.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Oh, I know you did send me back to the future. But I'm back! I'm back from the future.","Doc Brown is back in 1885 in the Old West, soon to be joined by Marty who has found that Doc is in mortal danger from Burford ""Mad-Dog"" Tannen.Rounding out what turned out to be a hugely popular trilogy, Back to the Future Part III restored the core essence heart of Part 1, whilst simultaneously tying up all the threads with a fully formed story. More sedate in its telling (not hard following on from the manic pacing of part 2) part 3 fuses science fiction malarkey with, well, Western malarkey. All played out with the usual array of clever jokes and series reprises - only in a Wild Wild West setting. An interesting point to note is how the roles of Doc & Marty have been reversed from the first film, here Marty is the maniacal plot axis, whizzing around getting into scrapes as Doc ambles around in love, courtesy of the delightfully classic looking Mary Steenburgen as Clara Clayton. Thomas F. Wilson returns for villain duties as Tannen, a Western bully villain pulled straight out of many a classic Oater from way back in the day, and Lea Thompson & Elisabeth Shue ensure the ""past"" is not forgotten.When Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale started making Back To The Future in 1985, could they have envisaged that they would make three films and end up with a steam engine time machine in the Wild West? Possibly not, but as part 3 hurtles (literally) towards the suspense laden finale, two things are for certain. One is that they wisely closed the series down with a surefire coda winner. Two is that between them they crafted one of the most entertaining family trilogies to have ever graced the screen. No doubt about the fact that part one is the uniformly class act of the three, but parts two & three themselves reward groups of all ages. Great Scot indeed. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
This Was The Only BTTF 'Keeper' For Me,"Once I saw each of these ""Back To The Future"" films on VHS, after viewing all of them earlier in the movie theaters, I wound up only keeping one: this one.This film - the third and final one in the ""Back To The Future"" series, didn't have the annoying bully ""Biff"" (except in a subservient role at the very end) and it had a nice western look and flavor to it.Yes, it's a little loud and the two main characters - ""Marty McFly"" (Michael J. Fox) and ""Dr. Emmetr Brown"" (Christopher Lloyd) mainly shout to each other (probably to hear over the noisy soundtrack!), but it's generally an enjoyable two hours of film with fun-type characters and a cool Old-West theme.Even the bad guy is kind of fun to watch.

Training Wheels,"I enjoy groups of films, in a sort of ""mix tape"" way. Of particular interest are sequels and series where different writers and filmmakers are involved. I find the first three Frankenstein films differ in amazing ways for instance, ways that deepen the experience for each film.Here we have Spielberg clone Zemeckis in control of all three in the group. The first was apparently intended as a single project which had a risky creation, involving many changes. Some lack of coherence was introduced because of major changes introduced by the curse of test screenings.The second and third, however were written and filmed together. This was the first big Hollywood project designed in response to questionnaires. You can see it in the recipe. Need more love interest? More actual action? Less Biff? Costumes? Chop, chop, chop.There is a clever thing this movie has that the others did not. It knows it is a movie. It sends our travelers back in time not into an earlier version of their world, but into a movie world. Specifically, it is the most stable genre of all: the western. As soon as Marty arrives, we have the most common trope in westerns: wild Indians yelping as if it were 1955, chased by the cavalry. There are a few jokes about being not in the real world but in a movie world, including the requirements for what happens next.It is not enough. By this time, we are tired of the whole thing.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

They didn't save the best trip for last,"Back to the Future Part III is a difficult film for me to review.  On the one hand, I am far from enamoured by it, but on the other it's the final act in the otherwise excellent time travel trilogy.  First off, it must be stated that this entry is the weakest of the three.  Many Future fans will disagree with me, citing Part II as the weak link.  What they overlook is that Part II has no grand finale like Parts I and III and inevitably suffers because of it.  Nothing is tied up, loose ends remain, questions go unanswered and confusion reigns  so it requires the last chapter to put the world of Marty McFly to rights.  But Part II offers greater all-round entertainment, its darker tone offset by some exhilarating action and futuristic special effects.Part III is, to all intents and purposes, a love story with a formulaic Western theme.  It is more like the 1985 original in style, with much of the film taking place in one setting, with only two bouts of time travel, culminating in a rousing finale.  Unlike Part I, however, this film is lacking the extra ingredient to push it out of the pretty good and into the great.  Robert Zemeckis' direction focuses this film on Doc for the first time and perhaps it is this shift in emphasis that left me somewhat disappointed.  Interesting though Doc is, and pleasing as it is to see another side of him as he falls in love with school ma'am Clara, our hero throughout the series has been Marty.  We have rooted from him from the very beginning and Doc's romance does not hold quite the same appeal. Consequently, I am not a fan of the introduction of the Clara character. It's difficult to explain but I felt like Marty does in that she is forever getting in the way, a barrier to his and Doc's preparations to return home. She is not a dislikable character but in a way I ended up resenting the amount of influence she is has over Doc and hence the storyline.  Not enough goes on in the middle of the film when, with no relatives' lives to put right, Marty is a spare part for too long.The pace is deliberately slower than Part II  which was breathless throughout  but the film meanders, only getting out of second gear when the time travel sequences are involved.  That's not to say it's without its merits.  Doc and Marty's friendship is explored in greater depth and to good effect.  Marty's refusal to rise to the bait of another nefarious Hill Valley Tannen, Buford Mad Dog' this time, shows a belated maturity  sticks and stones and all that.  He later changes the course of his own destiny (the result of which was an unhappy and newly unemployed 47-year-old Marty in Part II), which demonstrated admirable character development.  The denouement displays some of the inventiveness lacking throughout the rest of the movie as an exploding steam train propels the DeLorean towards 88mph. It's a gripping last half hour, the pace having been noticeably upped for the better as the time machine careers towards a ravine, with Doc choosing to save the meddlesome Clara over a return to the future with his mulletted protégé.Upon returning to 1985, the DeLorean is destroyed by an oncoming freight locomotive, something which I was not altogether happy about.  It was such a sad moment given that the time machine had been one of the central characters throughout the whole trilogy.  Its destruction would be akin to that of the Millennium Falcon going down irreparably in Return of the Jedi  not at all a fitting end for a fine piece of kit.  And the final act where a married Doc returns with pearls of wisdom, two sons and a time travelling, flying steam train is preposterous and wholly unnecessary.  Sure, let us know what happens to him but one senses that by having the train take to the skies a la the DeLorean at the end of Part I, Zemeckis was attempting to add a symmetry to the trilogy that was not needed, or at least not in that manner.  It was a silly ending and the whole ""the future is unwritten"" and ""it's what ever you make of it"" flies in the face of the first 40 minutes of Part II which was all about altering future history'.  What exactly was the point of them doing something about Marty's kids when the future, according to Doc, remains a mystery?Nevertheless, the trilogy had to be rounded off somehow and it wasn't the worst ending the filmmakers could have conceived.  It does, however, leave a slightly bad taste in the mouth which is a great shame considering what, in the previous two films, had gone before.  Back to the Future Part III as a stand alone film might well have cut the mustard.  The love element and the old West feelgood factor might be enough to win over those after a pleasant afternoon's viewing.  Throw in the spectacular ending and you've not got a bad film at all.  But it suffers by comparison to the high standard of what has gone before, not least the exemplary Part I.  Back to the Future is among the best films of all time so following it was never going to be easy. Part II was sufficiently bright, breezy and imaginative to keep fans of the first film happy, without ever hitting the heights of the original.  Part III though has neither the happy-go-lucky charm of the first film nor the high-octane thrills and spills of its sequel.  For fans of the trilogy, it is a solid enough way to wave goodbye to Doc and Marty.  It has the in-jokes, the music and the blink-and-you'll-miss-them touches that let you know you're watching a Back to the Future film.  But it's by far the worst of the bunch and that I'm afraid will be its damning legacy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

1955 To 1885 & Back To 1985!,"Robert Zemekis(along with actors Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly and Christopher Lloyd as Dr. Emmett Brown) return to complete the trilogy in this very entertaining and satisfying conclusion, which sees Marty stranded in 1955 after the older Dr. Brown is sent back to 1885 in the De Lorean. He is helped by the young Dr. Brown to use the same De Lorean(left behind in 1885 for Marty) to get back to 1985, but instead uses it to go back to 1885 to rescue him, since he learns that he'll be gunned down by Buford Tannen(Thomas Wilson again) Doc doesn't want to leave though, since he has fallen in love with a new schoolteacher Clara(played by Mary Steenburgen) who is also destined to die...Highly entertaining completion to the saga is great fun throughout, making clever use of its ideas and culture differences, but doing so with the same good-natured charm of the first.

"Holds The Fashion of the movies, but I don't like it.","""Back to the Future Part III"" is often considered the weakest entry in the trilogy, with some critics feeling that the film's Western setting is a letdown compared to the more inventive time periods explored in the previous films. The plot is also criticized for feeling predictable and formulaic, with many of the jokes and plot points feeling repetitive or recycled from the earlier films. Some reviewers also felt that the film's pacing is sluggish, with too much time spent on exposition and not enough on character development. While Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are once again excellent in their roles, the supporting cast is generally seen as weaker than in the previous films, with few standout performances.

"An Excellent,Unforgettable Finale To The Trilogy And A Classic.","Back To The Future Part III is an excellent and unforgettable finale to the Back To The Future Trilogy that combines wonderful direction,a terrific cast,a fantastic script,an amazing score and great special effects. All of those elements make Back To The Future Part III a memorable conclusion to the Back To The Future Trilogy and a classic.Taking place after the events in Part II,Back To The Future Part III has Marty(Michael J. Fox)traveling back in time to the Old West to Hill Valley in 1885 to rescue Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd)and get him back to 1985. While there in the old west Marty and Doc have to deal with outlaw Buford Maddog Tannen(Thomas F. Wilson)while Doc falls in love with a woman named Clara(Mary Steenburgen).Back To The Future Part III is a brilliant and entertaining finale to the amazing Back To The Future Trilogy and basically proves that all good things must come to an end. Making a final film in a movie Trilogy is tough but Director Robert Zemeckis has created a conclusion that brings things to a fitting end that brings the Back To The Future Trilogy full circle. For 118 minutes Back TO The Future Part III combines different movie genres such as SCI-FI,Comedy,Western,Action and romance giving viewers a genre mash-up of 10 different movies in one but the movie never becoming uneven or confused. Whereas the first film went back in time to the 1950s and the second film went to the past present and future in 2015,Back To The Future goes back in time to the Old West with six shooters,Cowboys and stagecoaches. While the concept of a time traveling movie set in the West won't appeal to most viewers speaking for myself as a Western movie fan I loved it. There are plenty of references to Classic Westerns in Back To The Future Part III mostly to Clint Eastwood Westerns(Marty calls himself Clint Eastwood and wears a poncho resembling Eastwood's in the Spagetti Westerns). Don't expect a realistic or gritty vision of the Wild West because the way the West is depicted in this film is all in great fun. The Comedy and laughs in BTTF PIII are funny,over the top and go with the energy and style of the film which is lighthearted and humorous. The screenplay by Bob Gale is fantastic and memorable with dialog that gives this movie a nice energy and pace that keeps the movie going. While all three BTTF films are character driven Part III is probably the most character driven and introspective especially with our Heroes Marty and Doc Brown. With each of the three films we see Marty becoming more mature but still dealing with issues(Marty doesn't like being called a chicken). But as the film goes on he learns to grow and deal with the problem in an interesting way. With Doc Brown we see a different side to him we didn't see in the first two movies where we see Doc Brown firing a Western style gun,falling in love,showing romantic feelings or dancing with a woman which adds to Doc's character. We also see Marty and Doc friendship at a crossroads because while Marty wants to take Doc back to 1985,Doc is debating whether he wants to stay or go and dealing with their futures. It's the examination of Marty and Doc Brown's characters in this one that make Part III so watchable. The ending of Back To The Future Part III(which is the final 20-30 minutes)is fantastic,thrilling and will leave you with a smile and an unforgettable conclusion to the Back To The Future saga and for Marty and Doc. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent and brilliant as Marty McFly(and Shamus McFly)and Doc Brown once again showing great chemistry. Mary Steenburgen is wonderful and beautiful as Clara,Doc's love interest. Thomas F. Wilson is delightful as Griff Tannen,a Western outlaw and once again as Biff. Lea Thompson is great in a duel role as Maggie Mcfly and Lorianne Baines-McFly. Elisabeth Shue does a good job as Jennifer,Marty's girlfriend. Matt Clark(Chester The Bartender),Pat Buttram(Saloon Old Timer),Harry Carey Jr.(Saloon Old Timer),Dub Taylor(Saloon Old-Timer),James Tolkan(Marshal James Strickland),Marc McClure(Dave McFly),Wendie Jo Spencer(Linda McFly)and Flea(Needles)give good performances as well.The direction by Robert Zemeckis is outstanding,with Zemeckis bringing the same energy and style to the Western setting. Great direction,Zemeckis.The score by Alan Silvestri is outstanding,thrilling and fits in well with the Western atmosphere. Fantastic score,Silvestri.The Special Effects by Industrial,Light And Magic are incredible and visual stunning once again. Amazing effects,ILM.In final word,if you love Robert Zemeckis,SCI-FI Films,or the first two Back To The Future films I highly suggest you see Back To The Future Part III,an excellent and unforgettable finale to the trilogy.

After finding out that Doc is murdered, Marty goes back to the Old West to save his friend and return to 1985. This movie is my least favorite of the trilogy, but it's still a good movie. After the hectic Part II, Part III is a bit more laid back. I like this movie a lot, and although the first two are better, it's still a fun movie that I'll watch every now and again.

Wild West up Doc,"A bit of a riff on the what's up doc quote/line you may know from a completely different place. And a completely different place is where the movie goes. Because after the immediate past and the immediate future (30 years more or less can be considered that in my book), we get to the old West. And we pay tribute to the Westerns in many ways.One of them being Marty calling himself Clint Eastwood. A name that is synonymous with Westerns like almost no other (there's also the Duke of course). Again the chemistry between Doc and Marty is amazing and the backbone of the movie. This being shot back to back after the second one was finished really helped. Getting a trailer at the end of part 2 to get crowds or rather give them a taste was also very well thought of. Marketing wise it may have been a new milestone, a new way and path for others to follow.But money aside (and the trilogy made a lot of it), it seems we do end the movie series here. Even if there are always talks about sequels, I cannot imagine the original crew (or cast for that matter) to return for another run. Especially considering the health issues Michael J Fox has to handle. Having said that, this is a high note and a good way to end it all. A series that brought us or gave us very early performances in small roles by Billy Zane, Elijah Wood and Elisabeth Shue, to name a couple. But a series that especially made us fall in love with Doc Brown and Marty McFly ... knock knock: McFly, anyone home?

Satisfactory at best,"My main reason for wanting to see this movie was to find out what happens after part II, and after seeing this, I think they could have easily ended everything in that second part. But, in a way, I'm glad they didn't. It's not as great as the first 2 (final parts in trilogies rarely are) but by now I just liked the characters so much that it was nice to see them on one last adventure.This time it focuses more on the characters than any time travel paradoxes. Doc Brown falls in love, and Marty seems to grow up and take responsibility for things. That's all well and good but I never really felt the same excitement as I did while watching the first 2. I guess because this plays out more like an old west comedy than a time travel movie.

CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...Only six months after ""Part II"" came out, we got the final entry into the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy. It helped to kickstart a fun movie summer in 1990. Many have touted ""Part III"" as the weakest of the three movies. I beg to differ, I felt that it was the 2nd best one with ""Part II"" being the weakest of the bunch. It was very strong and a great finish to what started back in 1985. I was newly married by this time, and life was good - so, maybe I'm a little bit biased, but I loved this movie.This one picks right up where the last one left off, with Doc mysteriously disappearing having been struck by lightning while inside the DeLorean. Marty receives documents that had been sealed and saved for him for the past 70 years - and to his amazement, he finds that Doc is alive and well in the old west, in the year 1885. However, when he finds out Doc's demise, he knows he must once more travel through time to save his best friend leading to a climactic finish to our story.This was such a good movie with delightful performances. It was not only a great nod to western films, but to Clint Eastwood himself. The character of Clara Clayton (played by Mary Steenburgen) was a welcome addition. We also get a nice cameo from the band ZZ Top. This film ties up all the loose ends effectively, and it was a fond farewell to characters we've grown to love over the years. As the final credits began to roll, I felt a tug at my heartstrings. I was going to miss my friends.I highly recommend, not only this movie, but the entire trilogy. It should be watched back-to-back-to-back (1, 2, 3) ... and enjoyed again and again. When they came out on VHS tape (yes, I am that old), I purchased them and have watched them over and over through the years and loved it just as much with each viewing.

One of the best 3rd acts of any trilogy,"I absolutely love this film. With the hopping between the 50's, 80's and the future in the other two films, it was a perfect time for the franchise to go back even further. The old west is a great place to finish up the trilogy. All of the themes that played out so well in the first film are wrapped up here nicely in the old West.This film I tend to find on TV more so than the others. Not too sure why, but I think the overall finality of it and the setting are contributing factors. This was the first time someone tried to film a franchises 2nd and 3rd acts back to back. I think of the films that have tried this, this trilogy was able to do it the best.

Terrific Easily worth it's ten,"I was surprised to learn that people thought this was the weak link in the series. It is perhaps the most delightful because of the addition of Mary Steenburgen, Doc's unexpected love interest.She makes every film she's in a little special. Women could really take lessons on how she does it. Or maybe we'll never know. She played the same sort of role in Time After Time (1979). She's very formal, but because she's not the best looking person in any group of people, she lets it be known that she's very interested in letting the relationship go further. Give nothing, receive everything. Especially in the beginning. If ever there was a woman who represents the feminine mystique (or what men think of as the feminine mystique) it is embodied in Mary Steenburgen.The characters she creates are intelligent, been around, knows what's happening, but always takes a chance because one time she's not going to be disappointed. Doc doesn't stand a chance: it's not only her intelligence. It's she.Then there's Tannon. He would gladly rape Clara, but he would never succumb to her wiles. When ""Mad Dog"" (hope he never reads this -- he hates the name from anyone but his friends and I don't dance very well) wants to kill Doc at the dance, Marty throws a pie plate to spoil his aim. When Buford Tannon (""Mad Dog"") issues his threat, he finds out he has such a busy itinerary of wrong doing that the soonest he can work it in is two days hence, first thing in the morning. It's a Mastercard Priceless moment.Doc himself is his usual energetic goofy self, inventing things that raise absurdity to a new level. What makes him so funny is that he never tells a joke, would not understand one if it was told, and babbles scientific principles that exist only in his own mind -- certainly in no text I've ever read.Michael J. Fox is just right for the part. Even his counterpart in 1885 Shames McFly from Ireland you understand is a scream on the screen and yet there seems to be nothing you could point to that would make him as appealing and humorous as he is other than to say Fox exudes charm the way a boyish teenage class president exudes charm.This is a film worth spending a couple of hours with.

As well as finding a way back to 1985, the Doc also finally finds love in the shape of school-teacher Carla Clayton (Mary Steenburgen) and the man is thorn between going back home or staying with his new love.The Old West world set in Back to the Future Part III is a fantasy version, not a gritty view, despite reference to Clint Eastwood westerns (which is also a good thing when done right). But this is a family film so what do you exact. The plot is pretty weak compared to the first two films, and was too similar to the first film which was better. Some of the jokes, like Marty's dancing fall flat and there is a bit to much self referencing and repeated jokes. But they are still some good jokes, and Christopher Lloyd and Thomas F. Wilson were good in the film. Michael J. Fox is good as Marty, letting the character grow a bit more, but as Seamus his character wasn't that interesting and his Irish accent was terrible.Robert Zemeckis is known for his skill with special effects, but in this film he takes a more traditional approach, using stunt work and little graphics. He was trying to make a 50 style western with a modern twist. He again does a very good job with the series.Trilogies have often been a problem for Hollywood, with the third film being the weakest. It's not hard to think of examples, the Godfather Part III, X-Men: the Last Stand, Alien 3, Terminator: Rise of the Machines, Blade Trinity, The Matrix Revolutions, all good examples of films ruining their predecessors. However Back to the Future Part III is more fitting to the first two films and is meant to be an end to the series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A satisfying end to a beloved trilogy.,"While not as good as the first sequel it manages to be entertaining on its own.I appreciate that the writers gave a little more to Doc Brown's character by putting him in a dilemma of choosing his new found love or going back instead of just repeating his one-note presence as Marty's helper in the first sequel.But even if the setting seems a little odd at first, it still raises some fairly high stakes for Marty to cope with while still facing the same obstacles like in the earlier movies. And since all three movies are tied very closely together, Back to the Future pt. 3 is so worth watching just to get to that strong ending.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Easy to follow and easy to enjoy but yet far from being simplistic or patronising  a great family blockbuster,"Stuck back in 1955, Marty receives a letter from Doc Brown that was written in 1885. Marty takes the letter to Doc in 1955 and together they discover where Doc in 1885 hid the DeLorean. However while uncovering the machine, Marty spots a gravestone that shows Doc was shot in the back and killed by Mad Dog Tannen a mere week after writing the letter. Using the DeLorean, Marty goes back to 1885 to save Doc by brining him back to 1985 where it all began; however on arrival he almost immediately gets into trouble with Mad Dog himself.Having done the future in the previous film, this final instalment in the trilogy goes back to the old west to produce and enjoyable story while also poking fun at the traditions of the western. Similar to the first two films it is a solid family film with an easy to follow time travel plot. It also continues similar themes around the main one of the characters trying to get ""back to the future"" while we have other subplots regarding Biff, romance and so on. It isn't that deep or that complex but it delivers a solid story with a good heart that is never overshadowed by specific scenes of action and it is affectionate and fun. As director Zemeckis does a great job of pacing the film and providing fun that straddles both genres to good effect and the whole thing does look very professional.The cast continue to be be as good as they were in the other two films and mostly buy into the tone of the film and support it. Fox shows why he was a big draw when he was younger and is the real heart of the film. He just about holds his own alongside scene-stealing Lloyd (although his ""great scott"" stuff did get a bit old after a while). Wilson does his usual routine but still makes it feel pretty funny, while Tolkan does the same in a smaller role. Steenburger is a nice addition and works well with Lloyd in their join scenes. Thompson is reasonably OK for all she has to do.Overall then a fun and affectionate film that acts as a fitting conclusion to the trilogy. Easy to follow and easy to enjoy but yet far from being simplistic or patronising, it is a great family blockbuster that crosses genres and does so with a good heart.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"An great fun, old-fashioned entertainment from an terrific series.","Marty (Michael J.

Although this was the least successful in the U.S. Box Office but this film does play well on video. The leads are terrific in this.DVD has an sharp Pan & Scan (1.33;1) transfer and an good, digitally remastered-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.

Part III was an ideal time to end things,"'Back to the Future Part III' is the weakest installment of the series, though still produces a good, solid film to wrap the trilogy up.The western theme was nice, while the two stars again produced excellent displays.

Concluded,"""Part III"" is just as good as ""Part II"", both worthy follow ups but can't quite touch the original. It's got less sophisticated special effects and plot lines than the second film. I'd say the ending sours a lot of it for me too. Not the entire ending, just the very ending. I'm glad that it wasn't spoiled by a fourth part, this movie ends the trilogy at the right time, any more and they would have completely jumped the shark. The Wild West setting is awesome and I love a lot of the deja vu sequences in the second and third film that mirror a lot of things from the first.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are both great once again, as is the rest of the supporting cast. Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen) is a welcome addition to the cast. And we get to see Thomas F. Wilson return once again as Biff's great-grandfather Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen, which is awesome to see.There is a slight decline in my personal preferences throughout the series, but some hold ""Part III"" as better than ""Part II."" I like the western theme, but the future and the alternate 1985 really seal the second film as my second favorite. Of course, you should obviously watch the preceding films before this one, but once you get past the first two this one should be soon to follow. I recommend a day-long movie marathon; it's fun to watch these movies back-to-back and watch the time traveling adventure unfold all before your eyes.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
As flawed as part 2 but still an enjoyable conclusion to the trilogy.,"The final entry in the trilogy ends in the old west in 1885 when doc is accidently transported from 1955 in the conclusion of back to the future part 2 , marty has to go after doc and save him from the inevitable bullet of buford mad dog tannen and bring him back to 1985. Probably the funniest movie in the trilogy with some nostalgia with the entertainment value hiding certain flaws but it is understandable at this point in the trilogy as the formula is starting to wear thin.

A western touch for this final installment in the trilogy,"Without a doubt, 1985's ""Back to the Future"" turned out to be a massive hit. After that movie, it took four years for the first sequel to finally come, but then the final installment in the trilogy was released the following year. Neither of these sequels have generally been considered as good as the original smash hit sci-fi comedy, and it seems that quite a few ""Back to the Future"" fans have been disappointed by them, but in my opinion, they are both only slightly inferior.Marty is stuck in the year 1955 again, while the Doc Brown of 1985 is stuck in 1885. Marty has received a letter from Doc from 1885, telling him where he is, and giving him instructions on where to find the damaged time machine so the Doc of 1955 can help the 1980s teenager get back to his time. Doc has also told Marty in this letter that he is happy in 1885 and Marty is not to attempt to rescue him. However, just after Marty and the Doc of 1955 find the time machine, Marty sees a tombstone with Doc's name on it! It turns out that the scientist was shot in 1885 by an outlaw named Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen (an ancestor of Biff Tannen), not long after he wrote the letter to Marty! So now, despite Doc's instructions, Marty must use the repaired time machine to travel back to the old west and save his friend!If you look at the IMDb ratings and votes for the three installments in the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, it is clear that each one is less popular than the last. Each film has a lower rating than the last, and has less votes. In fact, the original 1985 blockbuster has a significantly higher rating than its two sequels, as well as a significantly higher number of votes. However, parts two and three still have reasonably high ratings, and both have over 40, 000 votes, which means they are fairly popular. While I agree that neither sequel can match the original, both of them have enough qualities to make them worthy sequels.Of the three movies, ""Back to the Future Part III"" definitely bears the most differences from the others. Since so much of it takes place in the old west, this final installment in the trilogy is partially a western, which is not something that can be said about its two predecessors. So, for fans of the previous two installments (or at least the original) who strongly dislike the western genre in movies, this conclusion in the trilogy would obviously be disappointing. However, unless you detest westerns in general, ""Part III"" could be very enjoyable for you, with lots of excitement, as well as some laughs (just like parts one and two). While ""Part III"" may not be as consistent as the original, it's still a job well done, and if you want to see how the story ends, I highly doubt you want to miss it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back To The Old West,"It's back to the past in this last sequel of a great epic time- traveling trilogy. In Part III Fox and Lloyd are joined by Steenburgen. The Doc finally solves the other great mystery of the universe; women. It's great to see his character grow and have a romance in an unexpected time period. I believe this plot element was beautifully handled.Once more the duo have a problem returning to the future, which is their present time, which is now the past. Gasoline of all things is now the culprit. But that doesn't stop the genius Doctor Brown from coming up with a plan to get home.I saw this in my teens at my local cinema as a double feature. This movie has it all: cowboys, gun showdown, romance, science fiction, and a train robbery...or was it just a science experiment?The future is what you make of it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
You and Marty 'might not be able to think fourth dimensionally' in the third 'Back To The Future' film.,"'Back To The Future III' finally shows that this most successful and popular movie series has come to a disappointing end. Made back to back with BTTF 2, BTTF 3 loses the magic that the first two movies captured, to its detriment. Marty McFly, the hero of the first two movies is now in a bit of bother as he is left stranded in back in 1955. When he receives an urgent letter from his good friend Doc Brown, Marty is told to leave him alone where he is. Marty is dumbfounded as to what he should do. However, more devastating news is about to be discovered by our junior time traveler.Fulfilling a long-time fantasy, Doc Brown has decided to live in the old West of the 1880s. But when he is in danger of meeting an untimely end, Marty travels back in time to rescue him. There is just one problem: Doc Brown is smitten by a school teacher Clara Clayton that he can't think straight! Now, it is up to Marty to keep Doc out of trouble, the DeLorean running, and the past, present and future on track so they can all get back to where - and when - they belong!Again the story of BBTF 3 is a highlight to this film. Bob Zemeckis and Bob Gale cleverly interweaved love and time in such a sweet and romantic way in all BTTF films. In the first it was Marty's parents, in the second it was Marty's own romance that needed help and the third focuses on Doc Brown and his love at first sight with the beautiful school teacher Clara Clayton. This movie is also placed in the old west of the 1880's, showing Hill Valley in the olden days. While I feel I have seen better western settings, the way the actors went about creating the 1880's feel, seemed accurate enough.The cast was back once again, to finish off the BTTF story. Michael J. Fox is one great actor. He once more shows why he was the perfect choice as Marty McFly. Marty has been through so much as a character that in no way would his character have been boring to portray. Again Fox had to learn how to do many of the talents that his character has to show off in the old west. Such things as Gun shooting and horse riding are just two of the new editions to the long bow that Fox had to learn. I feel for a guy like Fox who has succumbed to the horrible side effects of Parkinson disease. He has stopped doing full-time acting, which is a great shame.Doc Brown was once again performed grandly by Christopher Lloyd. He is so involved as the Doc, always warning of the dangerous effects that could go wrong if they interfere with the past or the future. Putting on his old west shoes in this movie, Lloyd does a good job in showing that he is not just able to be a wacky 1950s or 80's scientist. The way Doc gets Marty back to the future here is clever and one of the movies high points. The Doc's love interest is the local school teacher Clara (Mary Steenburgen) who was again well suited to her role. I have recently seen Steenburgen in the new release movie titled 'Life as a house', a movie that I really enjoyed.Other cast members include regulars such as Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson), who was another actor who made the transition from the first two movies into the old west beautifully. The rivalry that Tannen and the McFlys have on this film is one of the highlights of the entire series. I love it when 'Mad Dog' says to 'Clint Eastwood', `Nobody calls me 'Mad Dog', especially not some, duded up egg sucking gutter trash!'  Lea Thompson is back as Marty's aging Mother and long lost relative of the west, 'Maggie McFly'. With all of these actors taking on various roles making them incredibly interesting to watch, as you want to know how different they will be next. There is one another character I want to point out to you that I find interesting. Although he only has a minor role, Chester, the palace saloon bartender (Matt Clark) and I, have somethings in common. We share the same name oddly enough, in addition to the fact that I one day want to be a bar tender as well. Is that ironic? I feel it is!Overall the 'Back To The Future' series was and is still a delight to watch, 'time and time again'. The only problem I have with the second and third movie being made back to back, is that they each take a bit away from each other. I would have preferred a small gap between each one, so they could have both been given the attention they deserve. Robert Zemeckis is a great director and I am sure gives most of the credit for his success as a director to the BTTF trilogy. I am another fan of Zemeckis' work. I would love to have gone through the experiences that Marty McFly did with time-travel into the past and the future.  Yet I will always remember what Doc Brown says at the end of this movie `You're future is whatever you make it, so make it a good one.' That is good advice that I feel everyone needs to listen and do!CMRS give 'Back To The Future III': 3 (Good Film)",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Too silly with the Old West,"This movie continues from BTTF2. Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) is stuck in 1955 and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is stuck 1885. Doc is happy where he is, and he left the broken DeLorean to Marty. When they find that Doc gets killed only a week after leaving Marty the letter, Marty must repair the DeLorean, return to the Old West, and rescue Doc from his premature demise.While I understand the allure of going to the old West for director Robert Zemeckis, it just makes the movie seem hokey. I understand to go back to the 1955 Well a third time would be too complicated. The old west has a lot of Hollywood traditions tied in. But it feels like little more than one of those frontier amusement recreations. It's no longer profound, and it's the end of the franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Fun in parts but its clear to see they were running out of steam.,"Such is my affection for the Back To The Future movies,that i struggle to write this review but there is no getting away from the feeling that this is by far the weakest entry of the franchise.The things about the film that are good are the central performances from Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd who continue their excellent chemistry and energy. As with the previous Back To The Future sequel this movie plays on and repeats gags from the previous movies to great effect while also paying homage to popular culture with many references. The old west setting is fun at first but never as much fun as the journeys between 1955 and 1985 when Marty McFly interacts with his parents at his age. Mary Steenburgen is introduced as a love interest for Christopher Lloyds Doc Brown which only serves to stall the film and while some might like the love story element, its hard to properly fit it in to a film of this kind when the story strands are all being tied up and in the end it feels terribly perfunctory.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Compared to the first two... Yeah, it's not as good.","So... This is an absolutely enjoyable film... But it falls comparatively short to the first two films. This film still has enjoyable characters, with Marty and Doc being just as charming as ever. In fact, their 'role-reversal' is a welcome change. The cinematography is surprisingly great, and the sets look great. Clara is a fun character, and the love story between her and Doc is... Cute to watch. The random side characters that pop up are fun to watch, and often make their scenes memorable. Buford is... Not as good as Biff as a villian, but he's still kind of fun to watch. The set design is good, and the Old West is brought to life. Even the costumes are quite good. The score is also super fun and bouncy. So... If all of those aspects are good, I've always wondered why I really didn't like this film as much as the first two. And on this re-watch, I think I finally got it: It's not as ingenious as the first two. The first film has such a cool idea: What would happen if you stopped your parents from meeting? The second one was also quite interesting: What happens if you accidentally create a dark alternate timeline? The third one... What happens if you get stuck in the past? (Like the first film?) What happens if your own actions affect time? (Nothing new...) And... Though they are traveling to the past, that isn't anything absolutely interesting in the story, even if it's pretty interesting and cool to see brought to life. And, the past film had them going back to the first hand. Honestly, the 2nd film raised the bar so high, it's almost impossible to top...
But... It's still an incredibly fun film with a nice enough message. Still a good ending for the series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
okay film sequal. Though I preferred the first two.,"Back to the future (Part 3) started off really good, but went down-hill as the film went on. In between the scenes when Marty was recovered in the McFly home in 1885 by his great great grandparents and when Marty arrived back home to the year 1985 I found this film quite boring, but before and after those scenes, I found this film quite entertaining.In all three Back to the Future films there's sequences in which Marty and his descendants/ancestors are being confronted in a cafe/bar by Biff and his descendants/ancestors as well as when Marty injures himself and ends up being recovered in his mothers/great great grand mothers home and including a few other examples. I quite like this repeated sequence in the first two films, but seeing it again in the third film simply bored me, for its as though the same old storyline in all three films is being regurgitated over and over again with no originality whatsoever.If you think about it, there's no reason why Marty should have been temporarily stuck in the year 1885. The fact that Marty and the Doc couldn't fuel-up the delorean as there was no fuel(gas) facility in the year 1885 shouldn't have been a problem. Why - because if Doc Brown was able to write Marty a letter from the year 1885 for Marty to receive in the year 1955 and as a result of the letter Marty then went back in time to the year 1885, he could of also easily written in the same letter to Marty to receive in the year 1955 asking him to bring an extra supply of gas fuel when he visits the Doc in the year 1885. Itr would have been the only way we can get back home to the future'. Then they wouldn't have gone through the hassle of being pushed by a runaway train in order to get up to 88 miles per hour. This is just one example on how this film didn't make sense as there are many more examples similar to this one that I won't get into. One good element about this film is how it shows how bad things happen for a reason. When Marty went back in time and changed his parents destiny from being losers to winners, he not only changed his families past and present lives, but he also changed his families future - but for the worst. Seeing as Marty changed his fathers destiny, as a result of this change his father George McFly didn't loan his 4 by 4 jeep to Biff, for which Biff would've smashed up in a car accident in the parallel universe for when George was afraid of Biff. If Marty didn't change his fathers destiny, his father George McFly would've loaned the jeep to Biff out of fear and the car would've have been totalled in a car crash. That car was destined to crash! So that Marty and his girlfriend Jennifer wouldn't have used it that night to go camping, in which they wouldn't have crashed it out of a dare from Douglas Needles to go drag racing - leaving their and their children's lives in ruins, for which this car crash led to a result of their children being arrested in the year 2015. However their children's problems in the year 2015 was fixed when Marty and the Doc changed it for when they travelled into the future to the year 2015. It goes to show that although Marty did change his families lives for the better, in the long run it would have been better if he had left things the way they were. Destiny is set for a reason, whether its good or bad.I think making a third sequel to this film was a good idea, but I think it would have been a lot better if the director of this film made this sequel completely different from the first two films. A good idea would have been if Marty and the Doc were travelling all over time to different years doing whatever they want and meeting up with themselves in the same year that they've visited more than once without worrying about a time travel paradox. In my opinion this film could have improved, but even though I feel this way I'd recommend anyone to watch it, for it did have some good moments and if you've seen the first two 'Back to the Future' films you've gotta see this film in order to complete the trilogy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back To The Future Part III Is Second Best In The Trilogy,"Back to the Future Part III is an improvement over Part II because it flows better and doesn't constantly reshow scenes from the original. Viewers finally get closure on the main storyline as well.In Part II, Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Dr. Emmett Lathrop Brown (Christopher Lloyd) traveled to 2015 at the beginning of the movie to help save Marty's future son.While in Hill Valley in 2015, Marty got the idea to buy a Grays Sports Almanac - providing the winners of all sporting events from 1950 to 2000 - and bring it back with him to 1985.An older Biff Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) in 2015 overheard Marty's plan when Doc caught Marty with the sports almanac, and Tannen decided to steal the DeLorean time machine and travel back to 1955 to give his younger self the sports almanac.Viewers got to see Marty's family in the future in the beginning, but we weren't shown anything that important at the time.We're told that Marty got into an automobile accident when he was younger, which ended his music career as a guitarist.In Part III, we're finally shown how the car accident happened at the end of the film, which would be in 1985. It involved racing his acquaintance, Needles (Michael Peter Balzary).However, Marty avoided the car wreck because he chose not to race Needles by putting his ego aside and not letting insults or labels control his life.At the end of Part II, viewers also see the time machine struck by lightning in 1955, sending Doc to 1885. We learn in Part III that Doc wanted Marty to go straight back to 1985 instead of trying to rescue him.The only reason Marty decides to travel back to 1885 to bring Doc back is because he learns that Doc would get shot in the Old West just days after going back in time.In the third film, Marty and Doc also have to use a train in 1885 to push the DeLorean up to 88 mph after the fuel tank was hit by an arrow, and gasoline didn't exist back then.The plot of Part III hits the same beats as the original film while doing its own thing. That's what makes it the perfect sequel.By the end of the film, the time machine is destroyed, Marty is sent back to 1985, Doc stayed behind in 1885 to be with the love of his life, Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), and Doc ended up building another time machine in the 1800s to travel back to 1985 to tell Marty that no one's future has been written yet.A person's future is whatever they make it. That's a solid life lesson. The ending is kind of silly, in that, Doc built a time machine out of a train back in the 1800s, but he's a scientist, so I'll give him a pass on that one.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Final Film is Fun Enough, but Missing Something","Robert Zemeckis's fantastic time travel trilogy ends with a whimper. Well, all right, that may be a little harsh, but I don't feel it lived up to the fun of the first two. The finale finds Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) trapped in the wild west of 1885 and Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is determined to bring him back when he discovers Doc is murdered by local outlaw Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson). It's got some fun moments but my favorite aspect of the trilogy, time travel, isn't as prominent this time around.After Marty arrives in 1885, the time travel element is put on hold for the duration of the film, as the DeLorean is temporarily out of commission. This is unfortunate, as the DeLorean is probably my favorite ""character"" from the trilogy. Watching as Doc and Marty bounce around time to fix the paradoxes they create was always a blast; this time it's just a matter of getting back to the future before Tannen kills either one of them. We're also treated to a new love interest for Doc, in the form of Mary Steenburgen as schoolteacher Clara Clayton. It's nice to see Doc getting attention but it's still not what I was looking for in a BTTF film.The movie plays out like a generic western/fish-out-of-water comedy and is good for some laughs. Marty's reaction to antiquated life in the old west is funny enough and I loved the final act with Doc and Marty's final confrontation with Tannen and race against time to get the DeLorean up to speed. Still, of the three films, this film finds itself as the weak link in the chain. The cast is phenomenal as we've come to expect, and it really helps with the mediocre storyline. On the off chance you haven't already since this, don't expect the final installment of one of cinema's most memorable series to leave you completely satisfied, but at least you know you can count on an entertaining two hours.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
The last and worst of the Back to the Future trilogy.,What was the time-travel charmer thinking? A trip to the old-west and 1885 please give me and all other movie fans a break. What a terrible way to end a great trilogy. Instead of ending Back to the Future with an 1885 era why not keep the drama unfolding in the modern 1985 era or the baby boom 1955 era it would have had more interest with an audience in 1990. Sure this film like the previous two from the trilogy has excitement and good performances I must once again admire the work of Michael J. Fox. Yet things just don't seem the same I personally felt the final focused to much on the life of Doc (Christopher Lloyd) as in the end he is happy that he finally found his mate for life and returns to the old-west of 1885 more happiness should have been directed at Marty as the film could have ended showing him happy with family and wife Jennifer in the future. Believe I happen to be right about part III it clearly does not get the same numerous showings that the first two Back to the Future movies do as I continue to see Back to the Future get numerous airings on TBS and Back to the Future II get numerous airings on the USA cable network or Sci-Fi network when part III is rarely shown it just goes to show which movies in the trilogy had the best quality and most popularity. Watch the first two Back to the Future movies anytime you will get the best entertainment of your life avoid the third and final it simply just lost it's luster and ran out of gas. Then again you might enjoy if you like the western genre of film but I doubt it.,2.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
And so Doc rides off into the sunset on his rocket train with his new family,"The Back to the Future trilogy is now complete and we have now seen time travel from the current 1985 back to 1955 then fast forward to 2015 and then slingshot back to the old cowpoke days of 1885 in Hill Valley. Don't despair though because that dastardly badman Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen / Biff Tannen (Thomas F.

Wells time travel in the pretty Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen) and rather than have the romance aspect revolve around Marty McFly this time their are hearts a fluttering with Dr. Emmett Brown so the third time around is in fact a charm.It was a great way to end the trilogy and a western to boot!I give this third chapter a steady 9 out of 10 rating.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Contains my all-time favorite movie line,"I loved this film. It was very well done and a great way to end arguably the greatest movie trilogy of all time (with a respectful nod to Star Wars). This movie contains a line that has become my favorite in cinema history. When Doc is in the bar, depressed over being dumped by Miss Clara, sitting with a bottle of whiskey in front of him and holding a shot of whiskey, he spills the beans on the future. This violates all his beliefs about not messing with the space/time continuum.    One of the men at the bar notices that Doc has been talking abstractly about the future for hours, discussing inventions that nobody understands. ""How many has he had?"" the man asks. And then the line that--in my opinion--is a priceless classic: ""NONE! That's his first one and he hasn't touched it yet! He just likes to sit there and hold it!""",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Worst of the Trilogy.,"I think that the first two Back to the Future films were awesome. So I thought that when I saw the third installment that I would love that one as well. I was mistaken.Basically Marty has to get help from Doc Brown in 1955 to get back to 1985. After they uncover the time machine they discover that Doc was killed in 1885 by Maddog Tanner. So Marty decides to go back in time to rescue Doc instead. Along the way the delorian experiences problems and Doc Falls in love.I think this film does a good job of continuing the series. The beginning starts off right where Number two left off. When it gets to the Western Part is where the problems start.There is a lack of good jokes and action in this one. The other two were way more funny and had much better action.The whole western setting makes this film seem like a comedic western film rather than a back to the future film. It seems as if there was not as much going on and the main conflict of getting back to 1985 was not as pressing as the conflicts in the other films.Also I did not like the whole Doc falls in love part of this film. Maybe it is because the actress who plays his girlfriend, Mary Steenberg, added nothing to this film. Seems like she is just reading her lines rather than trying to act. Doc did not seem like the character that I knew from the first two films in this one.Michael J. Fox is great though. He always is great as Marty in these films and once again is in top acting form. His performance in this film makes the film worth watching.Definitely the worst of the series. Did not seem as exciting and funny too me and the whole love story made it lame. I recommend it the least of the series and at least this film puts an OK end to the series. Still it should have been better.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A taste of the original.,"...but just a taste mind you, then its back in the wrapper and on with the now unbelievably complex story in this final bit of time jumping good time, 'rum pum pum, bang the magic drum' entertainment. Better plotted than part II because it has a simpler, more character focused story, it's really Doc Brown's film in which Marty plays an lesser role and thats fine with me because he was always my favourite of the two anyway. I'm not a fans of Westerns, though they've grown on me in the last few years, but the third portion is a affectionate pastiche which plenty to enjoy and although a love interest sub-plot is about as welcome as freight train careering into your life's work, Mary Steenburgen, drippy and a little bit kooky, just about cuts the mustard though given her tendency to cause problems for the time travelling duo perhaps letting her fall to her death might have been the safest course of action. Its all tied up in a fairly moralistic, 'everyone gazes lovingly into each others eyes' fashion which makes us cynical Europeans groan a bit and I'm fairly sure steam power isn't quite a viable substitute for plutonium but in a series with flying cars and a Libyan terrorist cell chasing a teenager with a rocket launcher in the middle of a Californian shopping mall car park, thats just niggling.

A time traveling dolorian that runs on gas!,"I'm sorry to say this is the third best of the trilogy, which means it is at the bottom.  So I recommend to see either one of the first two if you want. But, that doesn't mean this film is a waste of time compared to other films.  For instance, this is a way to keep from watching CNN.  But seriously, this isn't all that bad, because for fans of westerns who want a chuckle, this is for you.  Or if you want to see Christopher Lloyd drunk.

Back to the Future Part III: 8/10,"To fully enjoy Back to the Future Part III, you will have had to seen and remember the first two Back to the Futures. They reference and allude to them so many times; you have to remember everything fully. Of course, the first one is the real one, so they go back to that one more often.Michael J. Fox is back for his third outing as Marty McFly, time traveler. Christopher Lloyd is Dr. Emmett Brown, mad scientist. In the first one, Doc made a time machine and Marty went to 1955 and made his parents not meet. In Part II, Marty went to 2015. Now, because Doc from 1955 went back to 1885 and he's going to get himself killed, Marty goes there. Believe me, the plot is a whole lot crazier than that. Speaking of crazy, Doc looks a lot crazier than in parts I and II.Not as good as the first, way better than the second. Fox and Lloyd are quite good, with comedic timing, real chemistry, and making sure the movie doesn't have one dull point. Also, Lloyd has superior chemistry with a teacher in the Old West, Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), who comes in. Of course, because Doc wasn't supposed to be out there in the first place, it causes a paradox in the time-space continuum, meaning that what would happen in the future won't happen. You can discuss the technicalities and the plot holes/paradoxes, but really, you're not supposed to.Not really being a fan of the Old West, I wasn't really looking forward to this. However, I do like futuristic movies, I didn't really like the second one. Basically, it's a flip-flop. Many times, it looked like a stereotypical Western, with its gunslingers and its facades.Going back to the technical aspects (besides Doc saying `Great Scott!' many times), if you think closely, the three movies take place in one day. The fun of these types of movies should be put into a TV series. Most movies-to-TV-series don't work, but if they keep going to different time periods, it would be fun.There's not really much more to say, except that it's funny and extremely entertaining, a must for any casual sci-fi, adventure, western, or comedy fan.My rating: 8/10Rated PG for profanity, action violence, and sticky situations.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
The third and final chapter of the Back to the Future trilogy,"Back to the Future Part III (1990) is the final chapter of the Back to the Future trilogy which began in 1985. Due to the same freak lighting storm that sent Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) from 1955 back to 1985, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) was zapped by the same bolt sending him to 1885. With the fate of the space/time continuum and the lives of Marty and Doc weigh in the balance of the events that will transpire in the wild west version of the city of Hill Valley and their ancestors. Can Marty McFly and Doc Brown put everything back in balance or will the universe collapse from within itself?The final chapter of the Back to the Future trilogy is a fun watch but a big drop off from part II. They were both shot back-to-back utilizing most of the cast from the previous films. The writing and direction of Robert Zemeckis along with the acting of Michael J. Fox hold this film together. Christopher Lloyd held his own as the eccentric Doc Brown along with the lovable and talented Mary Steenburgen as the new schoolmarm Clara Clayton.Fans of the series will appreciate the ending of the film and storyline.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"best sci-fi comedy ever, best in the series","You can't review each movie alone, the trilogy is so bond together that it's impossible.Must say that this is one of the most memorable Sci-fi comedies or movies related to time- travel in the whole film making history. The story's great, you'll love the plot. Dr. Brown's explanations make sure that even the most complex things could be understood by everyone. You'll get excited for all the high-tense scenes like never, even after seeing it several times. That's one of the best things about the movie. Alan Silvestri's score is just great, gives an emotional touch like not many scores do.Now, a little problem comes to the fx. instead of using models like in star wars (what also made star wars win Oscars for the effects) they started using CG, just CG technology wasn't yet so perfectioned in 80s-90s like nowadays. That's a little problem though, the movie's not overloaded with these FX at all.Also, I think this chapter is the best in the series, has the biggest emotional plot.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

The franchise flies off into the sunset with style.,"Though 'Back To The Future Part III (1990)' is perhaps the weakest of its trilogy, the film still maintains the absolutely stellar quality you've come to expect from the series. Its story, a much simpler time-based rescue, is as tight as possible, yet feels somewhat leisurely as both Marty and Doc undergo distinct character arcs during their time spent in 1885. This is refreshing, a much needed change from the brilliant but unrelenting pace of 'Back To The Future Part II (1990)', and it allows the film to feel even more character focused than its predecessor. This is perhaps its biggest strength, actually. You really come to understand the two core characters and become even more invested in their relationship. Once again, the performances are all on point. Fox rarely gets the credit he deserves; here, he turns in two similarly nuanced, down-to-earth performances. Lloyd is the much more noticeable of the leads, as he leaps around in joy or gasps in shock with his acting dial cranked up to eleven, but he gets some smaller, more intimate moments here that show another side to his abilities. Perhaps the most underrated actor to appear in these pictures is Wilson, whose turns as the various incarnations of the villainous Biff all feel unique and gracefully walk the line between believably heightened and undeniably stupid. His take on outlaw Buford Tannen is perhaps his most enjoyable role in any of these movies. Once again, there's that word: enjoyable. The film, like both of its brothers, is an absolute joy once it gets underway. It's also sublimely crafted in every conceivable way. Its train-based finale is maybe the best set-piece of the series, as thrilling as it is suspenseful, and its definitive ending is immensely satisfying. When all is said and done, the entire 'Back To The Future' trilogy is easily one of the best in movie history. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A Nice End To The Series,"From the beginning it was clear that there were only going to be three Back to the Future films with a beginning, middle and definite end. Twelve years after this film's release, it's nice to see that promise has been kept.I won't spoil the plot too much but Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd once again do a good job. Fox as Marty McFly travels back to 1885 to help out Doc Brown who is in a spot of bother.Just like the previous two films there are plenty of laughs and some truly great scenes (particularly the final scenes). My favourite scene was where McFly who is in the wild west tells everyone his name is Clint Eastwood and they all look at him in disbelief (""What type of a name is that?"").All in all, this was a great end to a fantastic trilogy.

Great Scott What a excellent trilogy,The Back To The Future Series remains one of my most favorites even today I love them they are like a fine wine only get better with age.There's something special about these movies that just makes you love them and they just really hold up as masterpieces.I remember watching this one a lot as a kid on VHS and there is so much to like about this movie.The plot for this film centers around Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travels back to 1885 to find Dr. Emmitt Brown (Christoper Lloyd) before Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F.Wilson) finds him first we are also introduce to Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen).The fact the movie is set in the Old West makes it plenty of opportunely to use the setting and it does that pretty well.The Effects are pretty awesome plus I enjoy the comedy bits of the movie it goes to show how with creative writing you will have a win win for the fans. Also the movie is full of great movie quotes.The Acting in this movie is very strong with the Back To The Future films you can always count on good acting and this film is no different the cast once again brought their craft to the filmThis film does a great justice on wrapping up a great trilogy and it is one of the best third movies in a series ever.I give Back To The Future Part 3 an 10 out of 10,10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
How is this 7.4?,"Not sure why this film is a 7.4?Also 'Karate Kid' (original) is 7.3? Maybe take the votes away from the illegal teenage stealers who rip these films off and then vote '1's - mean-spirited little peopleThe film works very well on a technical level, with some good Western-style variations on Alan Silvestri's memorable theme score. There is a strong continuity, in plot and references, to the previous films. The over-the-top, cartoonish style of the second film has been replaced with a more relaxed, romantic tone that eases the series towards it's conclusion. Special effects are as spectacular as ever, particularly in the train chase finale.The old-style Western setting allows for a lot of funny nods and references to Western films, particularly 'High Noon', 'My Darling Clementine' and, most memorably, 'A Fistful of Dollars'. Marty passes himself off as 'Clint Eastwood' and when he refuses to face Tannen in a duel he's told: 'Everybody everywhere will say Clint Eastwood is the biggest yellabelly in the West.'The acting, on all fronts, is much better. Fox completes his character's arc begun in the second film, as he finally learns the value of self-control and restraint. It's interesting how in the first film he resolves his parents destiny, in the second his children's, and the third film he finally sorts out his own. He also appears, with Lea Thompson, as his own ancestor. He has a cheesy Irish accent, but he still pulls the part off.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Not up to its predecessors.,"The last and weakest film in the ""Back to the Future"" series. Short on invention (especially compared to ""Part II"") and not terribly funny, this lighthearted comedy-Western relies heavily on the viewer's good will, established by the previous parts, and his/her familiarity with the characters, to camouflage the fact that the time-travelling premise is already wearing thin. But the frantic climax was impressive enough for me to give this an extra half-a-star.   (**1/2)",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
The best of the III,"This is a great part III and a great movie in general. While I liked the first two episodes, this one really brought a sense of character and family to our time traveling friends, Marty and Doc Brown. And this one was a complete reversal of Back to the Future, where instead of Marty being the center of the film, now it is Doc Brown. This is the case especially when Clara Clayton comes to visit Doc Brown at his house and he and Marty have to cover up the DeLorean, with a model Doc Brown built of how they are going to get back to 1985 near the car - in the first film, it was Marty's mother who visited him and Doc Brown (again both having to cover up the DeLorean and again with a model Doc Brown built to show how Marty will get back to 1985)! But not only this, the chemistry between Mary Steenburgen and Christopher Lloyd was heartfelt and director Robert Zemeckis really brought out the best in both. An excellent movie for sure!

It's  BTTF  western  style!,"The ending of Back To The Future Part II left most audiences a bit disappointed. That is however the true fans embraced the fact that Back To The Future would soon become a film trilogy.Picking up where we left off from the original sequel, Marty is stuck in 1955 with no Delorean. Doc Brown has been sent off to 1885 from a freak accident.Marty Mcfly is determined to see Doc Brown home to 1985. That is however when a charming Clara Clayton, (Mary Steenbergen) comes to town, Doc suddenly finds himself head over heals for her. While this is going on, Marty's short temper lands him a staged fight with the notorious Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen. Not only that, but the Delorean time machine is still not functioning correctly.The original theatrical release landed on Friday, May 24th, 1990 - Memorial Day weekend. Limited places around the United States were showing all three films back to back to back.What makes the third film exciting in it's own way is that this was a first chance to go into the wild west from the perspective of a time traveler, not somebody who was already there. This had never been done before, let alone having a time travel series reach a second sequel. The only other storyline that is remotely like this is A Yankie Doodle in King Arthur's Court, which is a plot that has been a bit over-exhausted.True fans of Back to The Future will no be disappointed. All of the main actors from the first two films returned, (minus Crispen Glover who had a few problems with the way his character was portrayed). Tom Wilson who plays Biff Tannen in the series made history by taking on multiple roles of the Tannen family members, Griff Tannen, Old Biff, Biff in 1985 and Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen.Rumors of a fourth film have gone across the web and back. It is in the contract with Universal and Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale have stated that it ends with the third film. The only other versions were the Saturday morning cartoon that ran from 1991 to 1993 and the Ride at Universal from 1991 to 2007.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A great conclusion for this trilogy,"Picking up where the second one left off, lighting struck the time machine as it sends Doc back to the old west in 1885 as Marty goes back to find him, and try to bring him back home to 1985. Meanwhile, Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen is having a showdown with Marty besides killing Doc, and Doc has fallen in love with the woman of his life Claire Clayton. Everyone has their own views on which ""Back to the Future"" sequel is the best, but to me personally, I think they're both good and I do say that I like three slightly more than two. However, they're both not as good as the first. In my opinion, I think the humor is just as funny as the first two, and I still think that taking place in the old west isn't that bad of an idea. I do like how the west looks, and really doesn't come off from a set of a television movie or show if you may ask. I thought the drama for the characters are really well handled, and I thought Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd both continue to be great together. Lea Thompson and Thomas F. Wilson are great too, while Mary Steenburgen does a fine job and I don't find her character annoying. The special effects are good, while some are dated like having two characters in the same scene just like what the second one did as I need to mention that. The pacing is well done, and the story really did kept me involved with it. Robert Zemeckis' direction is very well directed, and I love Alan Silvestri's music. The song ""Doubleback"" by ZZ Top is my favorite song of the trilogy, and I really do listen quite often. As for the ending, I thought it ended exactly how it should end as the movie does have a great message as what Doc says in the movie ""Your future is whatever you make it, so make it a good one."" I sure hope that everyone can relate to that line, and we can make the future whatever we want to make. I really have a lot of fun with this movie, and I don't think it deserves the hate it gets. ""Back to the Future Part III"" is a great conclusion for this trilogy, and I am giving this movie a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
So-so finale,"This film is a rather lacklustre conclusion to the Back to the Future trilogy.

Definitely the lesser one of the three but that doesn't mean it's bad.,"I'll admit that probably the reason why I find this movie to be the lesser one of the three Back to the Future movies, has all to do with the reason that Western has never really been my favorite movie genre. This movie is almost set entirely in the Wild West of the late 19th century.The movie features all of the Western clichés but at the same time it doesn't ridicule the genre. Pistol fights at dawn, hanging, robbing the stagecoach, typical villains, a sheriff, you name it and its in this movie. You may say that Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale pay a great homage to the longtime gone genre of classic spaghetti Westerns, with using all of the typical clichés and small references.""Back to the Future"" and ""Back to the Future Part II"" were two brilliantly written movies, with ingenious connected plot lines, moments and characters. ""Back to the Future Part III"" is also well written and is definitely fun and entertaining but just not as clever or ingenious as the previous two movies. ""Back to the Future Part III"" surely does still offer plenty of enough entertainment and cleverness. It makes sure that the movie overall is an entertaining one, that is also definitely helped by its characters and good, quick, fun directing from Robert Zemeckis, who with the Back to the Future movies made himself immortal as a movie director.Besides the Wild West concept the movie also differs from the other previous two Back to the Future movies in many more ways. Of course the Wild West already provides the movie with a totally different atmosphere and premise than the previous two Back to the Future movies but also the storytelling and approach makes this movie a 'different' one. You can really say that perhaps this time the real main character of the movie is the Doc. The main plot line (a love story) of the movie involves him. Not much room for Marty and his family this time in this one, unlike had been the case in the previous two movies. I liked the previous two movies so much because Marty clashed in his past and future with his own relatives, that were alive at that time period. It always resulted in some comical- and brilliant written and constructed moments. ""Back to the Future Part III"" doesn't really have enough moments of that. It still has some fun moments involving time traveling and of course mainly the cultural differences that show what happens if characters from this time period are being set back in the early 19th century. It makes some of the moments in the movie still hilarious, such as Marty's clothes, his choice to name himself Clint Eastwood, Frisbees and the opening ceremony of the well known clock from the Back to the Future movies.The movie of course also future 'distant' relatives of characters that are alive in 1985, the real-time, time period of the entire trilogy. Some play a more prominent role than others. Again the main villain is a Tannen. Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen, to be exact. A typical stereotype example of a dumb but ruthless Western villain. He is perfectly portrayed by Thomas F. Wilson. The entire cast is basically great. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd have really grown into their roles and the chemistry is still there. They are being helped this time by the great Mary Steenburgen, as Doc's love interest.What I love about the Back to the Future movies is that they always pick things up were the last movie ended. It makes the movie really a trilogy that can also be perfectly watched as one movie, just as the Lord of the Rings and Star Wars movies.The movie is really great looking with great sets, costumes and make-up effects that suit the time period of the movie just right. What the movie also does well is blending in the different atmospheres of the different time periods with each others. When the movie is set back in 1985, you don't have the feeling like you're watching a totally different movie. Dean Cundey's cinematography of the movie is great and he also plays a small cameo role in the movie itself by the way. Alan Silvestri's musical score is also great but again also the lesser of the three in my opinion. But it's still great, so what am I really complaining about...The early special effects are also quite good, considering its period this movie was made.The movie is really great, fun, clean, adventurous entertainment to watch from start till finish, with fun characters, settings and directing. A fitting conclusion of perhaps the most entertaining movie trilogy of all time.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Yet, Doc doesn't even get out to hug marty or shake his hand. He just gives him a picture and is on his way. Gee, see you in another 8 years Marty! Duh. Horrible ending.

A rousing sendoff,"The first Back to the Future film was absolute genius. What a brilliant story, Marty McFly stuck in the past having to ensure his parents get together lest he be erased from existence. In Part II things got a little complicated and convoluted. Back and forth we went, from 1985 to 2015 to the hellish alternate 1985. And ultimately back to 1955, in fact right back into the first movie, Johnny B. Goode and all. Maybe it was at times a little hard to follow, maybe it wasn't quite as much fun as the original. But Part II was still an excellent film with a very smart, albeit complex, story. And that set us up for Part III which would prove to be a worthy conclusion to one of the greatest adventures of all time.When last we left our heroes Marty McFly was stuck in 1955 (again) and a bolt of lightning had just sent Doc Brown careening back to 1885. Doc is quite content to live out his days in the Old West. Through the magic of Western Union he has told Marty to go to 1955 Doc (keep your Docs straight) for help in returning to 1985. But Marty and 1955 Doc make a terrible discovery. Just six days after writing that letter to Marty the Doc stuck in 1885 will be shot and killed. ""Shot in the back by Buford Tannen, over a matter of eighty dollars"" reads Doc's tombstone. As 1955 Doc puts it, ""What kind of a future do you call that?"" There's only one thing for Marty to do, fire up the DeLorean and head back to 1885 to bring Doc home.From there it's a rather simple story, much simpler than either of the first two films. No more bouncing around the space-time continuum, no paradoxes to unravel the universe. It's basically just a Western. But as Westerns go it's quite a fun one. Seeing the Hill Valley of 1885, and its cast of characters, is quite a treat. There's another generation of McFlys for us to get to know. There's another Strickland, always the disciplinarians in that family. And of course, as in any good Western, there's a vile, odious villain. And in a Back to the Future film that villain just has to be a Tannen. Buford Tannen, call him Mad Dog at your own peril, makes his descendant Biff look like an innocent choirboy. Mad Dog more than lives up to that nickname he so despises. And there is one more important new character. Clara Clayton, a schoolteacher who greatly complicates Marty and Doc's return to 1985. Because Doc Brown, always the pragmatic man of science, has fallen head over heels in love with this woman who died decades before he was born. Seems maybe we'll have a paradox after all.So Doc decides rather than go back to 1985 he wants to stay in the past with Clara. Of course there's the small matter that he's days away from being killed. It all makes for great entertainment. No, it's not as brilliant a story as in either of the first two films. But this simpler story has so much charm. It's great to see Doc in love and Clara makes a perfect match for him. They're like two lost little puppy dogs, the connection between the two instantaneous and incredibly endearing. What kind of a woman could fall in love with Doc Brown? Mary Steenburgen does a great job in portraying Clara, the kind of woman who could do just that. With Steenburgen having the key female role Lea Thompson has only a bit part this time around. But it's great to see her, you can't imagine a Back to the Future film without her. Thomas F. Wilson is simply terrific as Mad Dog Tannen, a nasty villain whom Wilson infuses with wonderful personality. But of course, as ever, the headliners are Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd as Marty and Doc. One of the all-time great film pairings. Two great actors who were absolutely perfect for their respective roles. What a journey those two characters went on over the course of these three films. This third installment may not be as frantic as the first two. It's not bursting with excitement, it's a little slower, suiting its Old West time. After the grave consequences of Marty and Doc's actions in the other films the story here can seem a bit mundane by comparison. But it still entertains, it really is great fun. Maybe the fact the consequences weren't so grave allowed the film to let loose and just enjoy itself a bit. We get one last look at these characters we've come to know and love. And this film gives them the rousing sendoff they deserve.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

"Not As Good As The Previous Two,But Still Terrific,","Back To The Future Part Three is a fantastic movie with an amazing story line,terrific characters and a great cast.Fans of the previous two installments wont be too disappointed,I do think that the previous two are better,but this is still terrific,especially for a third installment,but I just found the the previous two,jumping around from past,present and future,more interesting and exciting than the Wild West heme in this,but its still very enjoyable with a good Western parody and wraps up the trilogy perfectly,you wont be wishing they made a fourth one,because they started and finished this trilogy too well to take any chances with a new version.Back to the Future is definitely the weakest of the trilogy,but its still both an exciting and pleasing conclusion.Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) travels back in time to 1885,where his friend Doctor Emmet Brown (Christopher Llyod) is enjoying a more peaceful wild west atmosphere there,but Marty must save him,because judging by his gravestone that Marty discovered in 1955,he will be shot and killed in one week.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back to the Future Part III: Time Travel With a Western Twang,"Alright, fellow BTTF devotee, prepare to mosey on back to 1885 with Back to the Future Part III! Now, I know what you're thinking': ""Worst"" of the trilogy? Sacrilege! But hey, even a dusty tumbleweed in the Back to the Future universe is still kinda awesome, right? So, let's saddle up and see if this wild west adventure delivers yeehaw-worthy entertainment or leaves us with tumbleweed tumbleweeds of disappointment.First things first, let's giddy-up with the good stuff: Doc Brown's stuck in the Wild West! And who else but our favorite time-travelin' teen, Marty McFly, is gonna hightail it back to 1885 to save him? This movie throws us into a rootin' tootin' good time with shootouts, saloons, and a showdown with Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen that'll have you chewin' on your popcorn faster than a jackrabbit on a hot tin roof. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are, as always, a comedic dream team, their chemistry as strong as ever (even with Doc sporting a questionable handlebar mustache). Plus, the addition of Mary Steenburgen as Clara Clayton, a spunky schoolteacher with a hidden sharpshooting talent, adds a delightful new dimension to the mix.Now, let's talk about the aspects that might not be as shiny as a gold pocket watch: Compared to the mind-bending timelines of Part II, the plot in Part III feels a tad simpler, more focused on the classic ""hero saves the day"" trope. Sure, there's still some time-travel shenanigans with the ol' trusty DeLorean (powered by... horse manure? Don't question it!), but it doesn't quite reach the same level of complexity. And let's face it, some of the Western stereotypes and humor might feel a bit dated to modern audiences.But here's the rootin' tootin' truth: Back to the Future Part III, despite its minor stumbles, is still a ridiculously entertaining movie. It's a love letter to classic Westerns, packed with action, humor, and heart. The characters are charming, the setting is unique, and the story, while familiar, delivers a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy. Plus, who can resist Doc Brown yodeling his way through a saloon brawl?Verdict: 7 out of 10 spurs. Back to the Future Part III might not be the most groundbreaking entry in the trilogy, but it's a charming, funny, and action-packed conclusion that sends the franchise out with a bang (or should I say, a gunshot?). So, saddle up, partner, and enjoy the ride! Remember, even time travel adventures with a few rough patches can still be a blast from the past (or future, depending on your perspective).",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Superior to the second one, in my opinion","The final installment in the Back to the Future franchise once again picks up from where the previous film left us, with Marty (Michael J. Fox) trapped in the past and with a letter in his hand from Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd), now living in the 19th century as a village blacksmith. And thus, it's once again the job of our heroes to get, you guessed it, back to the future.The first Back to the Future is undoubtedly the best in the franchise, there's no arguing about that. It is the most original, gets to do the best jokes, flows the smoothest and has the tightest narrative. But, many would claim that the second film is also the second best. A fair point, as it has some of the most memorable scenes and is arguably the most creative of the three. But, personally I do think that it jumped around a bit too much and that the third one is the better movie because it tells its story better, contains all the good sides shared by the two previous films and is a magnificent end to one of the best movie trilogies ever made.Plus I'm a sucker for good western comedy, which this movie has tons in it. That might have something to do with it.Once again all the actors reprise their roles and do it magnificently. Thomas F. Wilson shows a whole new side from himself as Mad Dog Tannen, a Wild West outlaw with a grudge to settle with Doc. The new characters, most notably Mary Steenburgen as Clara Clayton, also do a good job of being both sympathetic characters as well as hilarious parodies of the western stereotypes. Just like in the previous films.Definitely do check the film out if you haven't seen it already and liked the previous two films. It continues the story flawlessly and is an exciting end to our tale of Marty and Doc.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Too Many Logical Flaws,"The problem I had with this movie was that it could never have happened. For instance, Marty was planning on returning to his time until he saw Doc's grave.  By going back in time he effectively saves Doc so therefore he would have never seen Doc's grave and never have gone back to get him (Doc). This creates a paradox.  If they would have talked about that or changed their time theory model then I would have rated it much higher, maybe an 8 or 9, but I really hate it when movies contradict themselves.  They can be unimaginable, but not contradictory.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Have a nice future,"It vexes me no end just how many people are in the habit of calling this the weakest of all the 'Back to the Future' movies  I'm not going to claim that it's any real patch on the 1985 original, of course, but then again the original was undeniably one movie of a special kind  innovative, fast-paced and sharply-written, words cannot describe the kicks I still get out of watching it after all these years. Try as they may, neither sequel was quite able to match this golden standard, but at the very least 'Back to the Future Part III' is on equal par with the second film (and at most it's heaps better). While you can look back on 'BTTF Part II' as a loud, flashy and perfectly enjoyable theme park ride of a flick, oozing with thrills and spills but of the somewhat more superficial sort, 'BTTF Part III' has succeeded in toning down all the hyperactivity by a notch, devoting a bigger thrust of time to plot and character and thus making it the superior follow-up all-round. Here, the real backbone of this trilogy  the friendship between Marty McFly and Doc Brown  is given a lot more weight than in the previous round, throwing the unlikely duo into all sorts of perilous situations to test their loyalty to each other, and earning it points for warmth and heart. As before, both Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd have tackled their roles brilliantly, and the best laughs continue to come from Marty's sweet naïveness in contrasting the present with the past (if that moon-walking sequence doesn't do it for you, you seriously need to order a new sense of humour  go try your luck on Ebay). Plus, Doc Brown's new love interest in Mary Steenburgen doesn't serve this movie badly either, even allowing the screenplay a couple of quiet and reflective moments to finally consider some of those philosophical musings that might just cross your mind when you mess with the space time continuum.So although a massive improvement on the 1989 instalment, there are reasons why this never manages to pack quite the same punch as its big father film of 1985. The biggest problem that 'BTTF III' has in setting itself primarily in the Wild West is that it's virtually impossible to pedal clear of the standard clichés (not to mention forced Western accents) you'll find attached to any level of parody of this genre. And while the vast majority of parallel scenes from the other BTTF movies that are echoed fondly throughout work to good effect, I for one was getting a little tired of Thomas F Wilson always having to crash head-first into a pile of horse manure (it was funny the first couple of times). There's also the rather messy subplot concerning Marty's personal future that had to be carried over here from the previous flick, drilling in a good few extra plot-holes as it goes  but I'm a big enough fan to turn a blind eye for the most part. In the end, the overall air of this film is far too breezy and good-natured for any of its flaws to have any lasting detriment - it's very entertaining, you can warm to and understand the characters, and with action-adventure movies like this that's all that really matters.Everything considered, in concocting a fun and thoroughly feel-good final chapter to close this adventure and do the original movie justice, they succeeded well enough, enabling you to walk away with pure satisfaction in your heart. After all this time, this still emerges as one of the most memorable and enjoyable cinematic trilogies ever conceived. Godfather what?Grade: a very strong B+",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Da Best,I think that Back to the Future III was the BEST of the trilogy. It explores more of the Characters' personalities and souls. You have to watch the first two in order first though. It just sucks if you don't watch the whole thing in order.,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
the wild ride ends in the wild west,"In the final part of the back to the future trilogy we end up in the wild west. Which doesn't make any sense whatsoever since the hill valley is located in California but who cares with a movie this much fun. Anyway on to the plot: In order to save the doc from dieing marty goes back to 1885 to save him only to damage the delorean. Getting them both stuck in the past. While the doc falls in love and marty gets himself into more trouble than he can handle, they still have to find a way to get back to the future.The biggest problem in this movie is the fact that some of the village sets were never finished which was probably beyond anyones control at the time. While it makes sense that some things are still under construction it ultimately just looks cheap. Another thing that doesn't quite work is that while the movie is a parody on western it also tries to be a serious western at times.Thankfully the characters and the humor are still as strong as they were in the first two films and westerns are still a loads of fun making Back to the Future part 3 a decent ending of a great trilogy with a wild ride in the wild west.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"This third part ends an unforgettable trilogy. Zemeckis and his cast gave us a real gift that, unlike Deloren, can never be destroyed","Sometime after the release of the second part, the viewer can say goodbye to one of the best trilogies in the history of cinema. Circular, well-finished, with great performances. Seen as a whole, it is easily one of the best trilogies ever made, although Part II suffers from the dizzying speed of its script. Directed again by Robert Zemeckis, the film featured Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Mary Steenburgen, Thomas F. Wilson and Lea Thompson in its cast of actors. The film continues the story left open in Part II (1989): while arrested in 1955 during his time travel adventures, Marty McFly (Fox) discovers that his friend Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown (Lloyd), who finds himself arrested in 1885, was killed by Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen (Wilson), Biff's great-grandfather; Marty travels to 1885 to rescue Doc and return permanently to 1985, but things get complicated when Doc falls in love with Professor Clara Clayton (Steenburgen).Filmed simultaneously with the second part, this final part had its scenes shot in the American states of California and Arizona. The origins of the western theme of Back to the Future Part III go back to the production of the first film in the trilogy. During the filming of the first part, director Robert Zemeckis asked Michael J. Fox what time frame he would like to see; Fox replied that he wanted to visit the Wild West and meet cowboys. Zemeckis and writer-producer Bob Gale were thrilled with the idea, but held it until the production of part III.Despite being a spectacular film, the second part presents some inconsistencies in the script and is considered by many to be a bit confusing, with several comings and goings in time (past, present and future), in addition to having a frantic pace. These aspects do not get in the way of the experience, which proved to be extremely efficient, doing an incredible job of recreating scenes from the original film, pleasing the audience. Here in this third part, the rhythm of the story maintains a precise cadence, with a narrative much less frantic and without clippings with time jumps. It is a substantially linear story that, like the second film, makes use of viewers' familiarity with the mythology of the franchise, in addition to playing with Western gender stereotypes, from the first scene in the old west, with the conflict between white men and Indians. We have, for example, the saloon, with prostitutes on the first floor and the traditional whiskey served to the bad-looking men on the ground floor, men riding horses, carts, the railroad, a train robbery and, of course, the duel between the good guy and the bad guy. Zemeckis also takes the opportunity to make several references to classic films such as ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Fulminante Impacto"" (when Marty plays with the gun in front of the mirror) and, mainly, to the star Clint Eastwood and the western spaghetti (note how the traveling that reveals the city of Hill Valey refers to the same camera movement of Sergio Leone that reveals the city of ""Once Upon a Time in the West""), in addition to also making references to pop culture, such as Marty's dance in the hall clearly inspired by Michael Jackson .The characters remain great, the friendship between the protagonists is closer than ever, but the truth is that the essence of the trilogy is missing a little more: time travel. After watching the first films, the feeling we have is that the comings and goings of yore are missing. While Back to the Future II was a roller coaster, full of events and twists, the third part of the trilogy is not so exciting. Except for the scene of the locomotive theft and the whole preamble of the return to the future on the train tracks, the feature film lacks memorable moments. The absence of DeLorean and the possibility of new time travels end up taking from Back to the Future III the best quality of the saga: the potential to be anywhere in time. As he invested in the western, Zemeckis did not think that he could alienate fans of science fiction or adventure and, by not building a pure western, also failing to deliver what admirers of that genre would like to see. The film is halfway there.The script by Bob Gale and the direction of Zemeckis play and open space for many games with the western in general. There is the reproduction of the famous final sequence of Por Um Puhado de Dollars, the first film in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy, a film that is watched by the 1985 Biff of Back to the Future Part II in a beautiful foreshadowing. There is also the great satire done to classic westerns in which the heroes dressed in complete disagreement with reality, through the ridiculous pink cowboy outfit that Mary wears. There are natives hunted by the cavalry. It is a delight to look for references of the genre.
Once again we are introduced to Hill Valley and again we stroll through the most characteristic points of the city in formation. The great point of convergence is the famous clock that, for the first time, we see outside the fateful tower that would be struck by lightning in 1955. But we are also introduced to Marty's ancestors, the good-hearted Irish immigrants Seamus McFly (the Fox himself) and Maggie McFly (Lea Thompson reprising his role) who welcome Marty - or Clint Eastwood, as they prefer - on his farm. The characteristics of Irish immigration and the ""conquest of the West"" are all there, with the couple struggling to maintain the farm, not being accepted by the locals and functioning as we expect from characters like that in classic Westerns. Mad Dog Tannen is also the stereotype of the movie villain of the genre, with his huge mustache, dark clothes and tough guy's pose. Thomas F. Wilson plays an extremely amusing villain. It is amazing how Gale and Zemeckis work naturally with each character, presenting them to the viewer without any continuity solution.The novelty is due to the introduction of Professor Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen) in the narrative structure as romantic interest of Doc Brown, who considers love illogical. The interaction between the two is excellent, with a Doc without words and taken by the girl who saves from death, potentially changing the future. Steenburgen's role in the story is organic and truly important, starting a chain of events that flows into the tape's epilogue. The plot of romance between the two works well because we care about the scientist, because we want him to relate to someone on a higher level than the intellectual.In addition to constantly referring to the characters' striking characteristics, such as Marty's untimely reaction to being called a coward, the script also reveals several actions that would reflect on the future of families in the city, such as when Doc and Clara talk about the geography of the moon, which would inspire the name of the doctor's dog many years later. The script is still full of comic relief, as when Doc says ""I'm glad I didn't end up in the Middle Ages"", because there he would be burned at the stake or in the funny joke about what is produced in Japan. We can still quote the joke about the origin of the ""frisbee"", the origin of the ""Clayton"" ravine that turns into the ""Eastwood"" ravine and the ending of Tannen that refers to the previous films.Zemeckis also shows talent in creating subtle and symbolic moments, as in the plan where McFly plays with his great-grandfather, still a baby, while Seamus McFly talks with his wife. The McFly family's future depended on the child's survival and Marty knew this, as is evident when he tells Seamus ""take good care of the baby"". When Marty informs Doc that Deloren was out of fuel, the close-up on the scientist's face exposes the seriousness of the situation and, at the same time, reveals the image of Marty in the mirror, now quite concerned. And finally, Zemeckis perfectly drives the exciting back-to-future sequence on the railroad, alternating between plans showing Marty in distress inside Deloren, Doc trying to get to the car and Clara trying to reach Doc, in a great scene that also has special effects from Industrial Light & Magic, which, for example, allow Doc's final flight to look credible.The feature also features a great ambience work that throws us into the atmosphere of the old west, starting with the director of photography by Dean Cundey, who uses the sepia tone characteristic of the western and, together with the general plans of Zemeckis, explores competently the beautiful landscapes of the region. The excellent art direction of Margie Stone McShirley and William James Teegarden and the costumes by Joanna Johnston also help to acclimate the viewer, through the wooden structure of the city's buildings, the traditional saloon, men's hats and boots, impeccable dresses women and the train that runs along the railroad.With Alan Silvestri's unforgettable score and the ZZ Top bearded special participation (appearing at the party in the old west and with a song on the soundtrack), Back to the Future III may not be the best chapter in the trilogy, but it entertains the enough with its range of memorable characters. The end result balances action with romance and visual accuracy as efficiently as the original classic. A cinematic pleasure like few others. When we see the vehicle that transported our dreams being completely destroyed, the feeling of sadness is inevitable. The end of Deloren also symbolizes the end of the trilogy and, at this moment, nostalgia takes over the viewer. Not even the happy ending, with the happy return of Doc and Clara aboard one of the most incredible time machines in cinema, avoids this sensation. On the other hand, we feel fulfilled by being able to follow three films with such quality, that they never fall into the repeated repetition of formulas, seeking to reinvent themselves in different ways. With a lot of creativity and inspiration, Zemeckis and his cast gave us a real gift that, unlike Deloren, can never be destroyed.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Weakest entry in the series, but still very good","This was a great way to close off a classic trilogy. Though it obviously wasn't on par with the first, I think was was almost as enjoyable as Part 2. The plot was much less complicated, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. It's a good thing because it's much easier to wrap your head around, however it shows that the writers were more concerned with finishing the series than making another classic. The majority of the cast reprise their roles, and are all as great as ever. The Clara character was kind of annoying, but I can forgive that because she was important to the plot. I liked the ending, great way to end the series. Last but not least, what western fan such as myself wouldn't love the Good, Bad and the Ugly reference!

"As sad as it is, Back to the Future 3 is the final film in a great series.","As sad as it is, Back to the Future 3 is the final film in a great series. Every time I watch it, it becomes a little sad, because the characters of Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Crispin Glover, Thomas F. Wilson have become like family to me, and I don't want to say goodbye to them at all.The last film of the trilogy is the most extraordinary, because here all the action takes place in the Wild West, and, accordingly, the picture has become mostly a western, but not without a fantastic component. All the same beloved characters are present in the frame, but with a funny change - Thomas F. Wilson (Biff Tannen) now plays his ancestor - Bufford Tanenna, the famous bandit. This is the beauty of the plot, because in fact in the entire trilogy there is only one obvious negative character, and with the name Tannen!Also in all the films is the famous Hill Valley cafe, which is in all time periods of history, and in 1885 it was a saloon!Very fortunate in the third film was the fact that Emmett Brown found a lover. And found successfully. Mary Steenbergen played the role of Christopher Lloyd's Clara - a little absent-minded, completely sincere, sweet and fond of Jules Verne. Only such a woman could win the Doc's heart!Of course, at the end of the picture, you feel sorry for the time machine itself. Although Doc Brown made convincing arguments about the dangers of time travel, but in three films she became very dear and close to all viewers. And how delightful it was to see Doc Brown come back from the past, which would seem already unthinkable, in a new time machine-engine and with his family to boot!One cannot but mention the outstanding music of Alan Silvestri, which ranks among the best soundtracks in the world. When the title theme starts to play, goosebumps immediately run through the skin, because it portends amazing adventures and exciting action!Back to the Future 3 is a must-see and recap, because such pictures are becoming less and less common and you should not deny yourself the pleasure.

The weakest of the trilogy is still decent,"A solid conclusion to the trilogy, even if it's the weakest...I think the West is a cool setting, but I thought it was a little out of place for this series. It was a weird jump to start in the past, the future, then the West. It reminds me of when they decided to go with an alien vibe for Indiana Jones 4. I also found the usual Back To The Future tropes to be the most awkward for this film. Marty's great grandparents were underutilized and felt useless to the story. I wasn't as invested in the characters as much in this western setting, unlike the first two.This is still a decent movie though, Robert Zemeckis directs this movie wonderfully. All the actors are spot on. I loved that this film gave Doc Brown more as a character. It was cool seeing someone like him fall in love. Buford was a nice addition for Biffs family line. Lastly, I did like the white knuckled train scene at the end, it was pretty suspenseful and a nice climax to top off the trilogy.",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"The worst of the trilogy, but still fairly entertaining.","After the crazy fast paced special effects extravaganza second film, that takes us to not just 1985 and '55, but also 2015 and 1985A, you'd expect a just as exciting conclusion. Unfortunately, you'd be wrong, as the third film in the series is the slowest, with less plot than any of the others, and less at stake. With that said, the third film also gives a chance to slow down and see Doc and Marty's relationship, and a chance to no longer focus on special effects and cool set pieces, but instead on the characters. It's the least exciting of the three, but still a fairly good end to the trilogy.1985 Doc is stuck in 1885, and according to a grave Marty and 1955 Doc find, 1985 Doc is going to be killed by Biff's great grandfather, cowboy Bufford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen. So Marty must travel back to 1885 to stop Doc from being killed, and to get both he and Doc back to 1985. Meanwhile, Doc has fallen in love with Clara (Mary Steenburgen), a science loving resident of 1885. After getting in the middle of things, Marty soon finds that he's the one that will be killed by Mad Dog, and he needs to find a way back.I'll start with the positives on this one. This was the slowest of the films, so it gave a time to stop and really soak up the environment, and linger on the characters. In this way, it was more like the first film than the second. The first one was pretty slow paced, but focused a lot on relationships, and this one does the same thing. The film has a nice atmosphere, and despite not being as impressive a set as the one's featured in the first, and especially the second, the western set is still impressive. This one also wraps itself up nicely, ties up all the loose ends introduced in the second film, addresses all the plot points mentioned in part two, and leaves us with a nice message to sum up the trilogy.The negatives? Well, this film just kind of feels anti-climactic. It's like the first film starts off slow and built up to the crazy fast paced second which is huge and puts everyone's life on the line, and then we get to the third, which is slower than the first film, and only prominently features Marty and Doc from the previous films. The film has somewhat of an exciting climax, that incorporates elements from all three films, but nothing is really new. Most of this stuff is just retread from the first two films, with only a few new elements.This is an entertaining film, and fairly fun, but definitely the weakest of the three films for me. It just feels like it's kind of running out of steam compared to the other two, but the ending leaves a nice message.My rating: *** out of ****. 115 mins. PG for language and violence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Almost As Good As The First One,"""It's a pretty rare situation when the first movie is amazing, the second one is a mess, and then the third one or the final one is almost as good as the first one, i do not expect that this one is gonna be that good , because what i see in Part II is just making me so nervous and have a prediction that the third one is either worse or same, and guess what? I absolutely loved it, i have some fun time with this last film, i love the perfomance as always, i love the supporting actor and actress too, and the most important thing is the story, i think the story is just so fun, romantic, and hilarious and i like it, there's some of a scene that maybe they could do better especially the ending but at least is not a bad ending, overall Back To The Future Part III is still not as good as the first one but almost and it still fun and worth to watch, i highly recommended""",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

A great finale!,"The finale for the BTTF series is great. The Old West, what could be better? Since the Delorean was put in a cave, and it got those white walls, amazing! Then when he meets the ancestors, he had to use the name Clint Eastwood, so he wouldn't let them know he's a descendant. The bar scene is a hoot. The fancy footwork, Marty(Michael J. Fox) singing the song ""BAD"". Then he has to save his friend, ""Doc"" Emmett Brown(Christopher Lloyd) from an assassination. Finding out stuff from the 50's was a necessity, both Doc and Marty worked together as a fine team. The train scene is classic, since there's no fuel around the locomotive boosted the DeLorean, and went back on the tracks when Marty comes back to 1985. The Delorean may have been history, but the locomotive become the new time machine. Far Out! This movie was perfect. I liked very well. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are a team.

"Back to the Past,then the Future, Again","For my comment on the 1st ""Back to the Future,"" I mentioned how there aren't too many time travel movies because all the good premises have been used up in a select few sf films (""The Time Machine,"" etc.)... This is never more evident than here, the 3rd & final chapter of the McFly clan and Doc Brown, where-in new cast member Steenbergen essentially duplicates her role from ""Time After Time"" of '79. Once again she is visited by a time traveler (the Doc in this case) and gets swept away by him in grand fantasy fulfillment. Or was this all a sly nod to her earlier film role and that film? In any case, some of the stuff with changing photographs and repetitive motifs (Marty/Fox waking up as Lea Thompson hovers over him) begins to get stale and it's just as well this was the finale. Most of the film takes place way back in 1885, where our heroes need to figure out a way to get their 'time-vehicle' up to 88 mph without fuel.Halfway through, I began to compare this effort to low-end time travel movies such as ""Timerider"" (also a plot involving going back to the old west), which is not a good thing. However, this benefits from the engaging characters we've come to know in the previous 2 films and a lot of silly wordplay on the 'Clint Eastwood' name, which is worth a chuckle. To me, one of the more clever scenes was a pay-off on the foreshadowing of a famous scene from an actual Eastwood movie (""A Fistful of Dollars"" I believe). But almost all the interaction with the western characters was like from some average TV episode, including all the dumb conflict with yet another incarnation of Biff (Wilson), here a foul-looking gunslinger. The romance angle is sort of sweet and the climactic action on the hurtling train is well done, as expected. The final little whammy with Doc & his bride is not too surprising, but I found it interesting no explanation was offered for Doc's triumphant return (wait, that hover-board from the previous film - is that how he did it? - great scott!). The end could have been a set-up for a series titled something like 'Adventures in Time with Doc Brown' but maybe it's just as well nothing like that happened.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

East meets The West.,"My Take: Not the strongest in the hit series, but strong enough to keep the series moving.When it finally reached Part III, the BACK TO THE FUTURE series has certainly showed its age. The film's lack of the ingenious ideas that the first films had isolates this from the first two. The film is more of a Western comedy for most part of the film, but not a bad one. Still at the hands of the highly creative crew of Robert Zemeckis (director,co-writer), Bob Gale (writer) and Steven Spielberg (executive producer), BACK TO THE FUTURE III (which was shot back-to-back with Part II) doesn't succumbs to sequel dreadfulness, something that other sequels usually fall upon.The film is not as special effects laden as the second, nor as the first. Although it would probably have been for the best, it lacks the pure high-concept fun. The film rests itself as a Western comedy for most of the time, including a quirky love story between the series' best character Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) and fluent schoolteacher Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen). McFly also challenges the toughest gunman in the West named the ""Mad Dog"" Tennen (Thomas F. Wilson), presumably Biff Tennen's ancestor. For most parts, its a less effects-driven comedy, with more emphasis on comedy.The path taken by this sequel makes it less crowded and confusing as the second in the series, but it also lacks the manic charms. The original was more lively for most of the time, and it had more ideas while the second film moved at a fast pace with fun at every corner. This film settles to heavily on a Western comedy mode, which makes it rather lacking.But the overall effect is still a good movie. Not as good as I hoped, and this one is the least that holds up among the three films, but I liked it and why wouldn't I. The script, although not filled with the clever time-travel hokum that I loved in the first two, is still cleverly filled with deft comedy bits and appealing characters. It's often tired and repetitive, but there's still so much to recommend.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Another Great Sequel to a Great Series,"It's hard to believe that someone could make a third-installment that is just as good or at least pretty close to the other two films.  I really liked this film and it is a great continuation of part II.  I'm not one to like westerns, but this movie really pulls it off (of course, this isn't really much of a western, just a western setting)!Robert Zemeckis is definitely one of the best directors out there and he doesn't let you down with this film.  The acting in this film is great, the story is incredible and the special effects are superb.  I have to say that I'm really impressed with Michael J. Fox and Thomas F. Wilson in these films because of how many different characters they play and how many different versions of the same characters they play.  There really isn't much I can say other than ""See This Movie!!!  And if you haven't already, see Part I and II.""  This is definitely a great finale to a great trilogy.

Good ender to the series,"Surprisingly the third instalment of the ""Back To The Future"" series still holds up the interested to the end, and even tough it's not as funny as the first one it does have a couple of delicious scenes in it.This time Marty (Fox) goes in to the wild west to save his friend Doc (Lloyd) from early dead of lead poisoning. We also see Doc falling in love with pretty teacher Clara (Mary Steenburgen).Special effects are again used more sparingly, just like in the first one, which is a good thing considering the state of special effects of that time. This ensures, that the viewers won't have enough time to start criticizing them and they look good enough to fool the eye. The bloat of effects was a small problem in part 2 of the series.There are small amount of jokes and situations, that are direct continuity from the two previous films and you need to have a keen eye to spot all the reference jokes to the previous episodes. The truth be said, I don't believe, that the film wouldn't work as well if you haven't watched the previous films before, just because of the whole time continuum play.This is a good ender for the series and I hope, that this will be it. But if the third sequel will ever be made I would hope, that it would be made by the same individuals involved in the series, as I doubt it would be the same without Fox and Lloyd.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Clara on tombstone,"It says in the Goofs that ""Factual errors: On Doc Brown's headstone, it says he was laid to rest by his beloved Clara on September 7th, 1885. But according to history, Clara was supposed to have died falling into the ravine (which would be named after her) days earlier, which also means she and Doc most likely would have never met."" I don't think this actually is a goof-up. The writers' would've spotted this one, it's too obvious.When Doc Brown first went back to 1885, he lived in Hill Valley for eight months before writing the letter to Marty. In this time he had made friends & enemies, as we all know. The mayor was one of these. Now, when Marty has arrived in 1885, the Mayor comes to visit Doc, and reminds him to about the arriving school teacher. Doc decides against meeting her.But, what happened in the history before Marty arrived there? Simple. Doc wasn't informed about falling in love with Clara, and went and met her. He (somehow) handled the horses, or took a different route, and they never crashed into the ravine. And what happened in the original history, the one where Doc never came to the Old West? No one went to meet Ms. Clara and she had to travel to town alone, and her horses were spooked by a snake.And now that Marty ""warned"" Doc about him falling in love with Clara, Doc didn't go to meet her, like in the untouched history, and again her horses were spooked. It happened differently, but again Doc was there to save her (even though we never saw the first rescue, nor did Doc & Clara even necessarily realize what might've happened).Aargh, this is much easier to think through, than to write down. =)",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

A decent and coherent ending.,"This is the third and final film from the iconic trilogy ""Back to the Future"", one of the most notable of the 1980s. In this movie, Marty McFly finds himself arrested in 1955 due to the accidental departure of DeLorean after being struck by lightning. But at that very moment, he receives a letter with instructions that ""Doc"" Emmett Brown sent to him from the distant year of 1885, where he himself was imprisoned due to the time machine breakdown. The discovery of the machine and its repair eventually allowed Marty to move to 1885 to try to rescue his friend and to travel safely to the present in 1985.The film is clearly the continuation of its predecessor and has direct connection with it. The mix of sci fi and comedy continues to be successful but this movie is more of the same, the big difference being the trip to the Wild West and the way the movie made humor at the expense of the old westerns. The striking figure of Clint Eastwood, one of the greatest western actors ever, is clearly honored.About Robert Zemeckis's direction, or the cast, I can only restate everything I have said in the reviews of the two previous films. The director did a good job, leaving us in these three films, perhaps one of his most impactful works. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd continue to dominate the film and provide us with excellent dialogue and humorous moments. Thomas F. Wilson, who brought Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (and his descendant Biff) to life, is also performing flawlessly, and Mary Steenburgen is also very good in her role, making a romantic match with Lloyd.Special effects, visuals and sound are an inseparable and important part of any sci-fi movie, but they are also important when the task involves recreating a long-time historical epoch, such as the Old West. Here they work quite well. Although not an expert in the field, I think the way the Wild West was recreated in this movie is minimally credible, although things are unlikely to be as the movie shows. The film sought to recreate the old Western, and that was largely achieved.Thus ends the Back to the Future trilogy. Personally, I think this movie is a worthy end for her. The movie is not perfect, could have been improved on some things, but it honored the predecessors and gave the plot a logical close. Like the other two films, this movie has been shown to age well, and we are likely to continue to see it, even on TV, for a few more years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
My fav,"I know the conventional wisdom is that Back to the Future Part III is the weakest film in the trilogy. And while it's certainly the least original - it's a Western remake of the original Back to the Future - but it's my personal favourite. Beginning exactly where Back to the Future Part II left off (you need to watch these movies in chronological order or you WON'T get them). Marty (with the 1955 Doc Brown's help) heads back to 1885 to save Doc, who is about to be murdered by Biff Tannen's great-grandfather, Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen. But once he arrives in 1885, the DeLorean was damaged by an Indian arrow - leaking all the fuel (irreplaceable) and rendering the car out of service for the next several decades. Doc and Marty must try and find a way to get the DeLorean up to 88 miles per hour - while at the same time staying out of Tannen's hair. But things are further complicated when Doc falls in love with a teacher.Again, the movie's a remake of the original. But it's a fun remake, but all the charm, humour, and climatic almost-doesn't-make-it tension that fans have come to expect. What effects are used are quite good. It also provides a very satisfying conclusion to the trilogy (and yes, it's a definite conclusion). A great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
The Most Enjoyable Trilogy Comes to an End,"The Back To The Future Trilogy in my mind is the most enjoyable Trilogy out there. The Movies are not too long, the characters are easy to like, the bad guy is fun to hate and the plot line is easy to follow for anyone. The Adventures of Marty McFly and Doc Brown are exciting to watch in the first two films and the fun doesn't stop in the third.Often called the worst film of the bunch, BTTF three takes our characters to the old west. I, myself, enjoyed this idea. We did the 1955 thing twice, we been to the future, why not go back to a time where we could see Hill Vally being built. How the Tanned family has been picking on the McFly family as soon as the McFly's showed up in Hill Vally.I also liked the idea that the third film returns to a more simple storyline. The first film was almost a love story mixed with action, the second was action with interesting ideas in returning back to a time where there are two Marty's and two Doc Browns, two people who have all ready lived that day and can't risk running into their younger selves. The third film returns us back to a love story, this time involving Doc Brown and his interest, Clara Clayton.Now, some people have questioned the idea that If Marty had not gone back to 1885, than Doc wouldn't have been their to save Clara.""but i did have one small doubt. clara is saved by the doc. and marty together. meaning had marty not gone back in time, the doc. would not have saved clara as both of them went to the cliff. in which case clara would have been killed had marty not gone back. THEN HOW DID HER NAME APPEAR ON THE GRAVESTONE OF THE DOC. BEFORE MARTY WENT BACK IN TIME?SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD LONG BEFORE THE DOC GOT KILLED""Interesting point, but one must remember that if Marty would not have come back to 1885, than Doc would have picked Miss Clara Clayton at the train station. See, in the original folk tale, before Doc traveled to 1885, no one picked Clara at the station, and she fell into the Ravine, however, when Doc goes back in time, Doc is there to pick Clara up at the station. When Marty goes back to 1885, Doc is asked to pick her up, but he forgets because he is with Marty, but later, Doc happens to save her anyway, thus falling in love with her.BTTF Trilogy manages to amaze me in each film, and the climatic train sequence is a wonderful ending to the Time Machine and the Trilogy.

A Beautiful Film FInale That Pays Homage to the Old West!,"Back to the Future Part III is so much fun. It is a sweet and entertaining finale to one of the best science fiction trilogies to exist. The first two films have similar ideas and themes, but Robert Zemeckis and company switched things up here. They created an homage to old-school Westerns, a very risky movie considering how westerns were not popular with moviegoers at the time. I loved the references to the westerns of old. Of course Marty would have to say the line, ""uh..Mar..Clint Eastwood."" That line gets me every time. There is a really sweet love story between Doc Brown and Clara Clayton. It surprises me that people seem to dislike their romance. I thought the chemistry existed between the two characters. Furthermore, the film took risks with this romance because it involved middle-aged characters falling in love, and that is never seen in movies. All things considered, Zemeckis took filmmaking risks and they all paid off. In addition, the visuals and special effects stand out. Cinematographer Dean Cundey used the bright desert colors to his advantage. The final action sequence was exhilarating. Marty and Doc had to come up with a way to get the DeLorean to 88 mph without using gasoline. That made this sequence very fun to watch. Even though I believe Part II to be a fun, entertaining film, Part III is better made and a great sendoff.Part II and Part III were shot back-to-back, which was a rarity in the late 80's, early 90's. Filming was a grueling process for Zemeckis. He would be shooting scenes for the third film on location (in places like Monument Valley) then would fly to California to edit the second film. He would repeat the process day after day. While most of the crew found the shoot exhausting, the cast found being away from civilization mostly relaxing. Cundey was also excited about shooting scenes in the barren Western landscape because he was able to take advantage of it. It is not like Zemeckis and screenwriter Bob Gale ran out of time travel ideas when creating the movie. Michael J. Fox actually told the director he always dreamed of making a western. Alas, here we are. There are homages to Westerns everywhere. There are three veteran actors from these films like Harry Carey Jr. Making appearances. The set design, of course, is beneficial to creating the Western landscape. There are even cowboy and Indian scenes! My favorite part is seeing the ancestors of modern-day characters during this era, such as Marty's ancestor, Seamus. Zemeckis's approach was to think about the film as a spiritual human journey. He did succeed.When Marty (Michael J. Fox) destroys the sports almanac, all seems to be well. But that is really not the case. Dr. Emmett Brown's (Christopher Lloyd) and the time machine were struck by lightning leaving the doctor in 1885. Marty receives a letter from Doc essentially telling Marty he is okay and to leave him alone. Marty and Doc's 1955 version find the DeLorean still able to work. Marty finds a gravestone with Doc's name engraved on it, apparently killed by Biff's great-grandfather, Buford Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson). Marty takes the DeLorean to save his friend, but the car's gasline is ruptured leaving them both stranded in 1885. They have to figure out how to get out of 1885 which will be very hard considering gasoline did not exist, and by the fact that Doc has his eyes set on the pretty schoolteacher Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen).Through three movies, Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd continue to have a natural chemistry with one another. I love their characters so much, so it was cool to see them work magic in a different setting. Lloyd likewise had great chemistry with Mary Steenburgen. Steenburgen took the role because she was hounded by her kids. Her character had such a sweet romance with Lloyd's character. Believe it or not, their kiss was Lloyd's first onscreen kiss. Thomas F. Wilson became a true villain when he stole the almanac last movie, so he made sure to embellish that in Buford. Buford is the best ""Biff"" villain. Lea Thompson did return in a rather thankless performance as Maggie McFly.People generally claim that Back to the Future Part III is the worst of the franchise. It really is not. It has a lot of heart, yet it takes risks. In a time where westerns were not popular, Zemeckis created one...and a good one at that. The romantic scenes between the middle-aged characters are believable. The ending is fantastic. Be prepared to have a tissue or two because tears may be shed. It is clear how much Zemeckis loves this franchise. He went all out on the visual effects to cap the series with an exhilarating end involving a train trying to power a DeLorean. In addition, Alan Silvestri created another powerful score. This is a poignant ending to a monster franchise.My Grade: A-",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
They should have stopped after the last trip on the time machine,"I think it was time to retire the old time machine. The second film got away with being decent, but this film went too far, and the villain (although related to Biff) is not as strong a character. This film is more like a western with native Americans, cowboys, and run-away trains. Yes, it is packed with action, but it is missing that extra edge that the other two films had. It also replaced the comedy element by becoming a little more serious. In short, it just did not do it for me, and it's not a very good film. It weakens the trilogy, in my opinion. I'm glad that they retired the time machine after this to prevent even worse films capitalizing off the title.",4.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Great Way To End Series,"Back To The Future 3 is the most exciting conclusion of the popular franchise and one of the best films of 1990 this time our favorite heroes go back to the wild west.

The second film saw introduction of Marty's girlfriend Jennifer and the finale saw Clara Clayton, a love interest for Emmett ""Doc"" Brown.The film was set in the 1885 old west, which was a great change.

Back to the Wild West,The final installment takes place in the wild west.

Back to the Future Part III,"""Marty"" (Michael J Fox) is stuck in 1955 when he learns of the untimely demise of his mentor ""Doc. Brown"" (Christopher Lloyd) back in 1885. Luckily, the DeLorean is on hand and back he goes - to the wild west - to try and prevent this calamity. Once there, he has no idea how to get back; a task not made any easier by local bully ""Mad Dod"" (Tom Wilson) who has it in for this meek city boy from day one. Spielberg is at his best with stories like this, and borrowing heavily from the Western film genre - and quite a bit from Clint Eastwood too, we have a quickly paced an amiable adventure film as Fox and Lloyd have to stay alive whilst figuring out how to charge the flux capacitor and get themselves home. Wilson is super as the ""baddie"" and Mary Steenbergen gives the ""Doc"" a little bit of love interest as the story ticks along nicely. These three films fit nicely with each other, and happily they all decided to hang up their stetsons after this one. It's still great fun 30 years later, with fun pithy dialogue; loads of great action photography and strong entertaining performances all through. Good fun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Definitely the worst of the series, but still very good","The first two Back to the Future movies are two of my favorite movies of all time. And I would consider the first film one of the most perfect movies ever made. But when I saw that the third one was going to be a western, my expectations went down a little bit. There's not really anything wrong with that, I'm just not a big fan of westerns, but I will say, this film is very, very good.One thing that has always bothered me, and this may be a spoiler, but Marty decides to go back to 1885 to save Doc because they find out he will be shot. But the 1955 Doc also knows, so why doesn't Marty just say to land the Delorean in a different spot, or why would Doc want to stay if he knows he will get shot. Also when you get down to it, the plot is just a rehash of the first movie, which I guess makes since for a film called Back to the Future, but still. And it suffers from the three curse of having the second one be so epic, but then this one is just a much smaller story.But Doc and Marty are still a lot of fun. I actually don't mind the character of Clara, she's funny, she's charming, and her scenes with Doc are actually kind of sweet. I love that we get a new villain, and he can actually kill some people. There's a lot of subtle and not so subtle references to the other movies. But the best part about this movie is the ending, the scene with the train has me on the edge of my seat every time I watch it.This movie is, good. It doesn't quite live up to the first two in my opinion, but it's still a lot of fun, and a fitting closure to the trilogy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Viewers Would Be BACK To Watch This Third Instalment,This is nice great instalment to complete the trilogy. I enjoyed watching this film. It certainly had a lot. The cast selection was fine. I felt that the storyline could have been stronger but it was still fine with the way it was. I enjoyed watching the whole trilogy. It was truly spectacular. This instalment makes viewers really think about their ancestors and their own place in this world. It also makes viewers think about all the historical events that happened in this world. This film and trilogy reveals to viewers the true reality of growing up and building a life. This is a great film and trilogy for all viewers to watch and enjoy.,7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A great conclusion,"The makers of the BTTF trilogy accomplished their goal: they tie up the McFly/Brown saga very entertainingly with this Old West scenario.Another review mentioned the 'studio look' of the Old West sets, but I didn't see that; they're actually not too bad for this type of movie--especially when compared with Universal comedy-westerns from the 60's and '70's (where everything from the costumes to the horse troughs in front of the saloon looked spotless and brand new, and the women all had perfect, lacquered, teased hair.)
Fox and Lloyd continue their unique chemistry, and the supporting cast is fine: the writers, wisely, didn't overuse the talented Mary Steenburgen and kept the character of Clara from intruding too much into the Marty/Doc dynamic. Thomas F Wilson gets to give a new spin as the antagonist Tannen -this time Western style, and it's my favorite of his 3 villain appearances. All this put together with whiz-bang special effects and deft direction, it's a fine conclusion to a timeless trilogy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Time Travel Isn't Fun Anymore,"Trapped in 1955, Marty discovers the time machine left for him by Doc in 1885.  Doc's instructions are clear: return to 1985 immediately, and destroy the time machine.  But when Marty discovers that Doc met (will meet?) an untimely end in 1885, he decides instead to travel back in time to save him. Unfortunately, as soon as he arrives in the old west, the DeLorean is taken out of commission, leaving both of them stranded in the past.  As they devise a way to get the car up to 88 MPH, Marty end up picking a fight with Biff's ancestor, and Doc falls in love.The plot works well, and part 3 is every bit as good a movie as the original (I thought the second was wholly lacking in the plot department until the final act), but this installment is decidedly less fun.  In fact, it would be difficult to categorize this in the action-comedy style of the first two. Part of the reason is that there are fewer jokes this time around, but even the jokes we do get are overshadowed by the darkness of the plot.The first movie was a fun romp in the past as Marty discovered that his parents actually were typical teenagers in their day.  Yes, we had the death of Doc Brown, but when that happened at the beginning, we didn't have an emotional investment in him, and as the movie went on, we got the feeling that some way, somehow, things would turn out okay in the end.The second movie had a very dark middle portion, but the movie didn't remain there long enough for it to cast a shadow over the rest of the film.  The final act returned us to the giddy frivolity of the original, leaving us smiling through the last forty-five minutes.Part 3 starts with the impending death of a character we have come to love. Some characters (namely, Marty's ancestors) serve only to remind us that the future is at stake, and Doc's love interest simply makes the emotional investment that much heavier.  In fact, at the end of the movie, when Clara unknowingly places herself in grave danger, we find it impossible to cheer her strong devotion because her actions may end up costing Doc his life! And this time around we don't have idiotic Biff (Buford is mean but not stupid) to lighten up the tone.As I wrote earlier, this is not a bad film, and I don't want to give the impression that I don't like it because I do.  But I'm glad they ended the series when they did, because this final installment clearly demonstrates that the fun was gone.B-",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

A fair enough ending to the trilogy...,"I grew up with the ""Back to the Future"" movies, and they do definitely have a special place in my heart. And honestly, I do enjoy all three movie, but of course parts II and III just doesn't measure fully up to the original 1985 original first movie.This 1990 third movie titled ""Back to the Future Part III"" from writers Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale is a nice continuation of the storyline and story arch from the first two movies. However, I have to say that it is also the least enjoyable of the three movies. Now, don't get me wrong, because I am not say that it is a bad movie, far from it. But it just lacks something that part I and II did better.Personally it is the Western era that doesn't sit well with me here. Sure, there are good moments while Marty and Doc are in the 1885, but I just feel that there is something missing from the grand picture of the storyline.The acting performances in ""Back to the Future Part III"" are good, and of course it is Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd that are the epitome of the trilogy. But this third movies also have good performances from the likes of Tom Wilson and Lea Thompson, both of whom have been in the entire trilogy.Visually then the effects in the movie are good and very much in tune with the rest of the movie. And there are nice touches to the movie from the wardrobe and props department as well.""Back to the Future Part III"" is certainly an enjoyable movie and an adequate enough wrap up for the entire trilogy. But it has always been the movie with the least appeal of the three for me.My rating of director Robert Zemeckis's 1990 movie ""Back to the Future Part III"" lands on a seven out of ten stars.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"An Unusual, Yet Satisfying Send-Off.","This final instalment of Robert Zemeckis' Back to the Future trilogy is a Sci-Fi Spaghetti-Western starring Marty (Michael J Fox) and Doc (Christopher Lloyd) and is regarded as the least loved. But when you watch it, you'll find the quality supersedes its reputation.In the second film, Marty is much less sympathetic. With the emotional stakes of Part 1 resolved, he just stumbles through the events of the movie. This third film solves that by putting the character of Doc centre stage and Marty in the ""voice-of-reason"" position that Doc once had.As the film opens, he is strictly clear with Marty to leave him in the old west, go back to 1985 and destroy the DeLorean to prevent anymore cosmic mishaps. When he encounters a lonely schoolteacher (Mary Steenburgen) he throws his caution to the wind, abandons his rules and finds himself questioning every action he has made in his quest through time and space.Having been convinced by Marty to end the relationship while he still can, the decision seems to break him more than her and he goes to ""drink"" his sorrows away. It's a very compelling situation for the character and the performance by Lloyd is fantastic as a Doc now stripped of his urgency, motivated by love rather than blind science. Steenburgen shines as Doc's love Clara and Tom Wilson once again steels the show as an oafish gunslinger version of Biff.A strange instance is the choice of Fox playing Marty's ancestor Seamus and Lea Thompson as his wife, given they played mother and son in the previous films. The character also seems like it could be more than what's on the screen. There's a scene where Marty and Seamus have an exchange where he explains how his brother (who just so happens to have the same name as Marty) was killed trying to picking a fight with an outlaw.Rather than have Seamus be that same reckless character that represents what Marty has become, he sort of the flawless, exposition-dumping character. It's also untrue to the McFly family trait of never amounting to anything. It's in a classic problem of avoiding the ""show, don't tell"" rule of filmmaking.However, like some trilogy enders I've seen. The goods definitely outweigh the bads. The way the film opens with it's subdued long-take and goes into it's moody setting is a welcome dial-back. Particularly due to the overly-cartoony second film.Repairing some of the problems that Part 2 had and putting new spins on what made Part 1 famous, Back to the Future 3 is a fun and, triumphant end to this iconic series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
I was expecting a grand finale trilogy ending. A great closing of the back to the future movies...I expected wrong...,"Before I get into everything let me say this. I don't hate this movie. I just thought it was a great disappointment to the rest of the trilogy. This movie's more like western mixed with comedy, then a back to the future movie. If you've read my comments on the first two back to the future movies, you can realize how much I loved them. The acting was superb, and the plot outlines and the script... It was wonderful. This movie I felt was just slapped together a bit at last moment. I was waiting for YEARS to see this movie, but my video store never had it. You see I had seen BTTF part2 on tv, before I saw no. 1, and then when we rented out the original BTTF, it didn't ruin it, but... I knew what would happen, yet no. 2 had confused me greatly because I was a little kid, and I couldn't understand why two Michael J. Fox's were running around in 1955, and what the time machine was. It was all very confusing. So like I said I rented no. 1 out, and it all started fitting together. So then I saw number 2 again, and seeing the ""To be concluded"" message, was a bit saddening, but yet I couldn't wait to see the grand finale. So for years the video stores I went to, for some reason never had it. Finaly one day I went there, and they had it, but no copy behind the box cover. SO when I finaly rented the movie out, about 2 weeks after that, the years of waiting had come, I popped open the box slid in the movie, pressed play AND...it got stuck in our VCR. Apparently they must've gotten it second hand, and it was about 6 years old. So then we took our VCR in for them to fix, since it was their film's fault. Lots of things happened, and they ended up forgetting to fix it or something like that. So about another 2 weeks went by, and I forget if they paid for a new VCR for us, but whatsoever, we had to get a new VCR because the other one was unfixable. After that I waited for them to get a new copy in, rented it out. I did the same thing as before, and it got stuck. NO OTHER MOVIE HAD DONE THIS BEFORE..ONLY PART 3 TWICE IN A ROW. This time, i was able to pry the movie out, and took it back, explained, again....and they said the film must've been so dirty inside it just got stuck when it started running. After that we tried different video stores, I was now desperate to see this movie. We finaly found another store with it, and this time the movie worked(GASP!). The beginning of the movie was great, but once he was in 1885...All I can say is this film is ok, but it does not live up to it's predecessors. I'll give it 8 out of 10, in the way of a good movie, but in the way of a sequel...no... a CONCLUSION yet..only 6 out of 10 stars. If you disagree with me, all I can say is you must not of enjoyed BTTF part 1 and 2. Because those, my friends are classic storytelling, at it's very best.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
The perfect conclusion,"I don't understand why Back to the Future Part III go so knocked out by everybody when they saw it and just say that they liked everyone but this. Maybe because it doesn't have the fast-pace of Part II but it more than makes up for it in humor. Plus, it leaves you satisfied, knowing that there probably won't be any more Back to the Future movies. Not as easy thing to do.The story picks up right where Part II's cliffhanger ended: Marty McFly (Micheal J. Fox) is stuck in 1955 when the DeLorean time machine piloted by his friend Doc (Christopher Lloyd), from 1985, is struck be lightning and sent back to 1885. When Marty discovers that Doc is shot a few days after his postmarks a letter to Marty, McFly decides to disobey Doc's wishes, go back in time, and save Doc from his fate. It is much easier to explain if you see Part II (all the movies, actually).I was kind of letdown by Part II's lack of humor but I am glad to see that it has been restored in III. Doc and Marty have some great lines and the overall tone of the Wild West in 1885 is light and fun (Marty's alias is Clint Eastwood). Both Chistopher Lloyd and Fox are fine is roles they have become quite familiar with. The only problem is Mary Steenburgen, who plays Clara, the love interest of Doc and one of the deciding factors on wether or not he should leave. She has an annoying quality and it's tough to root for the romance, although Doc is very likeable.The special effects are quite good in Back to the Future Part III, a signature of any film that Steven Spielberg is involved with. Alan Silvestri's score is also as good as it has been in the previous films.The movie really wrapped up the trilogy with humor and charm, plus great performances. As much as I like Back to the Future, I can't imagine another sequel, just because this movie ended it so well.

"Weaker, but a worthy conclusion to the trilogy...","Okay, let me just say - Part 3 is not quite as good as the first, nor the second, really. But it has it's strong points. We are reunited with Marty, who discovers that Doc has ended up in the 19th century. The movie unfolds as they race to repair time as best they can without screwing it up any more than they already have.Part 3 is also fun on the grounds that it brings together the two cinematic styles that can be most appealing to young children - science fiction and westerns. I know I thought it was really cool the first time I saw it. Now that I can take a step back and look at it from a technical point of view, it's still not bad. Granted, the script and directing are definitely weaker than the first two films, but this one is basically a necessary installment because, much like the disputed Matrix films, part 2 and 3 both are smaller divisions of a greater unified storyline. the acting is basically just as good as in the first two. If anything drags it down, it is that the western styling can start to feel tedious to someone who isn't really into that type of movie. Still, despite it's various weaknesses, it is a satisfactory conclusion to the trilogy, and you can't watch part 2 without part 3.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A good conclusion to a fantastic trilogy,"Back to the Future was pure fun. Part II was extremely well-made but without the spirit of fun. Now, in Part III, the spirit of fun returns. Unfortunately, this film, despite being enjoyable, is the weakest instalment in the Back to the Future trilogy. It picks up where Part II left off, and is extremely enjoyable. Unfortunately, it would've been so much better had the recreation of the Wild West days been more meticulous. Instead, every cliché from a Clint Eastwood western is recycled in here (with Marty taking up Eastwood's name, in homage). The result is a more fun film than Part II, but not nearly as strong.In the original film, Marty travels back in time, helps his parents overcome personal problems and get together. Part II had the brilliant idea of giving Marty a problem he struggles with, which people from the places he visits try to help him with. This problem is him being unable to control himself when he is called a name. Part III carries on this subplot, along with a new romantic subplot, which are the film's strongest bits and true joys.The Verdict: Not as strong a sequel as Part II was, but the original's spirit of fun returns in Part III. The result is the weakest instalment of the series, but a fun one to watch nonetheless.Overall Rating: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Back to the Future III is a fun, lighthearted continuation of the series with plenty of nostalgic moments.","My daughter and I recently watched Back to the Future III (1990) on Netflix. The storyline follows the events of the previous film, as Marty once again travels back in time to solve historical problems. Meanwhile, Doc has fallen in love with 1895. Marty encounters his ancestors as immigrants and watches Doc find love in the Old West.Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump), the film stars Michael J. Fox (Teen Wolf), Christopher Lloyd (Who Framed Roger Rabbit), Mary Steenburgen (Step Brothers), Lea Thompson (Howard the Duck), Elisabeth Shue (Adventures in Babysitting), and Tom Wilson (Action Jackson).I've always appreciated how they brought back the original cast throughout the series. This installment doesn't take itself too seriously, with a bigger focus on Doc. The costumes and situations are wild and over the top, with some barely making sense. I'll never forget the pink cowboy outfit they have Marty wear! The bear-chasing scene always cracks me up, and the bar scenes with their conversations and brawls are fun. The showdown with Biff in the streets is definitely a highlight, and everything involving the train is imaginative, especially the final crash and the new time machine. There's a lot of nostalgic gold in this film.In conclusion, Back to the Future III is a fun, lighthearted continuation of the series with plenty of nostalgic moments.

An Excellent Finishing Touch,"The first ""Back To The Future"" film was an all-time classic that needs no introduction. Its quasi-scientific approach to fantasy (where time-travel is explained except where doing so makes the plot impossible) gives it just the right touch for a mainstream audience. The second and third parts of the trilogy were filmed simultaneously, so they need to be viewed as a whole, even if they were not released as one; this obviously hurt II's performance with the critics and at the box office.The strength of the series has always been as a buddy film: Marty and Doc have a close friendship that few of us ever get to experience. They completely trust and rely on each other, and they only argue without ever really fighting or even hinting at betrayal. They can count on each other in a way that most of us can't, and accept each other's individuality. It takes a lot of trust to take the risks that Marty and Doc take for each other.Each movie of the series has involved the same characters in different time settings, and that itself is fascinating. Biff Tannen is now Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen, what one would expect a survivalist ancestor of the 1950s schoolyard bully or 1980s workplace bully to be. George and Lorraine McFly are now Seamus and Maggie McFly, a far more mature and industrious, and far less dysfunctional, couple that we would expect of first-generation immigrants of an era when there was too much work to be done for one to bumble around like George or become embittered like Lorraine. This ""Mr. Strickland"" is not a school principal, but a Marshall, and he is neither intimidated nor fooled by Biff/Buford. Doc Brown is back as himself, setting up shop as a blacksmith and relying on his superior knowledge to see his way through that era.Even the humor is transplanted. Marty gets to ""learn"" how to shoot on a practice range that looks like his favorite ""Outlaw"" video game and dazzles the locals. The chase scene is transplanted, but skateboards don't move well on dirt, so he is lassoed. The space-time continuum is threatened yet again, this time by Doc's love interest, Clara (played by the well-cast Marty Steenburgen). Doc and Marty are again ridiculed when they share their visions of the future with the locals (""automobiles?""), and we once again find our heroes having to figure out a way to get ""back to the future."" No one can say that this film or either one before it jumps any sharks, that's for sure. The story was amazingly true to itself throughout all three films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

The conclusion of the trilogy,"Back to the Future 3 adds western to their sci-fi / adventure cocktail. It works far down the road, however, the story begins to embrace so much time jump that it becomes difficult for me to keep up. It's still a humorous and well-played affair. The CGI is (of course) nothing to shout hurray for, and there are a few obvious continuity flaws. The biggest plus of this three is that Christopher Loyd gets a lot of screentime and that he can also play an enamored Emmet Brown. There are many small details that are attached to the previous films, which is fun to dive into.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
One of the best sequels I've ever seen,"Sequels are annoying. They think they can take the ideas from the original, and somehow build up a plot different enough and interesting enough to arouse people's interest in seeing it. And yes, people see it, but it really isn't any good. ""Back to the Future"" is perhaps the best 'sci-fi-comedy-thriller' ever made. Then they made ""Back to the Future Part II"", which I said was not an exception to that rule I mentioned, but indeed an improvement. But what about ""Back to the Future Part III""? Does it meet the mediocre expectations everyone had? No. It exceeds them.Honestly, ""Back to the Future Part III"" is just as good as the original ""Back to the Future"". On paper, it actually looks pretty boring; especially compared to the fast-packed action we got in the first two. And even after I've given you to storyline, you'll still have doubts. I'll explain my arguments contradicting that later on.Here's the story: Just like BTTF2, BTTF3 takes place at the exact time BTTF2 left off. Marty goes back to 1955 Doc and Doc passes out. The first new scene is actually the funniest scene in the movie: Marty had taken Doc home, and it's now the next morning. Marty and Doc are lying on adjacent couches in Doc's den, and when Doc wakes up, he still doesn't realize Marty's there. Then he voice records the events of the previous night into some kind of 1955 tape recorder, and then Marty taps Doc on his shoulder and Doc turns around, and puts on a hilarious performance, of how shocked he is to see him. Well anyway, the movie proceeds with Marty reading 1985 Doc's letter, in which Doc tells him that he's buried the DeLorean he took with him to 1885 in a mine (so Marty can use it to go back to 1985). HOWEVER...the mine is right next to an old cemetery, and Marty comes across a familiar tombstone.There's a whole lot more. As a matter of fact, what I just described is only the first 15 minutes or so. Hopefully, what I DID just tell you will convince you enough. And the bottom line of BTTF3 is: though Roger Ebert complained about how they've toned down on the time traveling quite a bit in this one, it really is just as fun and entertaining as the first and the second. The climax is especially wonderfully worth watching, as is the rest of it. Go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Back to the Future Part III moves briskly along like tumbleweed but suffers from steam depletion.,"When many exclaim a sentence similarly to ""bahhh the Wild West one is just stupid"", naturally I enter the film with caution. But after the mess that the DeLorean caused in Part II, it was not going to a be difficult task to improve upon its predecessor. Fortunately, this conclusive chapter brings back the swooning entertainment that produces more swings than saloon doors. Yeah cowboy! All that was missing was Clint Eastwood...oh, wait! Doc, after the events of the second film, is now trapped in western 1885 which sees Marty travel back in time in order to bring him back.Shootouts in the dusty streets, rodeos in the pale moonlight and a spittoon filled with western delight. Zemeckis throws Marty ""Clint Eastwood"" McFly into as much cowboy carnage as possible, allowing ornate exploration into this refreshing aesthetic change. Yet despite the overhaul in production design, it still remains the exact same narrative structure as the original and is unable to detach itself from being a re-hash. The same plot details, for example Marty getting knocked out and waking up in his mother's bed or inventively attempting to push the DeLorean to 88mph (because it's always broken!), are repeated. Beat for beat. And whilst the latter, which involves a cumbersome steam train, was probably the most exhilarating sequence of the entire franchise, the proceeding déjà vu story was far too repetitive for the sake of callback humour.The same criticisms from the previous chapter can still be applied here, but with Zemeckis focusing on just one timeline instead of multiple. Acting remains consistent, although Irish Fox was extremely distracting, as does the visual spectacle. Various scenes involving the same actor sharing the screen simultaneously were noticeable as the actors were never looking directly at each other, which again was distracting.However Gale's literary inclusion of Clara, a female plot device for Doc, was a breath of fresh frontier air. Finally enabling some much required emotional development for him, and it proves that a hearty central story is necessary for these films to thrive. It wraps up many convoluted plot strands from Part II (whilst creating a few new ones), but it concludes the trilogy with a heartwarming bow decorated in resolute defiance. Even if Doc hampered on about destroying the time machine for three films yet builds another one from a train just to say ""see you later!"" to Marty (it's the small details people!).Still, a much more entertaining romp than its predecessor which still unfortunately plummets into the ravine of repetition. Yet it does so in a good ol' fashioned western style. Yeehaw!",6.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Definitely much underrated,"This movie has been underrated from its release to this day. Even the producers and director underrate it.If you see the film out of context of the other two you will watch a nice and well-done Western parody, which on the one hand tries to mock typical cliches and on the other hand conveys something about real life on the Frontier. Isn't it quite funny how the ""educated"" Marty McFly falls for every cliche he has seen on TV? Even the gunmen (Tannen and his gang), who themselves try hard to *be* the feared Jesse James' of their valley, are baffled by Marty's view on the West.Almost everything that connects this part to the other two is nothing more than icing on the cake, knitting together some loose ends (i.e. Marty's inability to play the guitar). It doesn't add anything to the characters or plot or story. Nonetheless these in-jokes are brilliantly executed, coming nice and easy, not with big fanfare.I really recommend this film - although, let it be noted that it is not the brilliant and innovative movie that *Back to the Future * is. Or s dark a satire as the second part; it's just plain old fun with real characters.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A god ending!,"Back to the Future Pt. 3 seems to me a good conclusion to this great trilogy. This time we have it set in the far west and this time Dr. Emmet Brown takes a little more prominence adding more development of his character, Marty McFly remains charismatic and continues to give us funny moments trying to beat Tannen and an ending that left me very satisfied with what I saw during the 3 installments. Overall, I liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"""What's your name, dude?"" ""Uh, Mar...Eastwood. Clint Eastwood.""","Robert Zemeckis brings us the third and final installment in the BACK TO THE FUTURE series. This time starting off right where the last one ended Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) is sent back to 1885 when Marty (Michael J. Fox) was in 1955. So Marty finds the Doc Brown from 1955 and they visit the gravesite to find Doc's tombstone. They end up digging up the DeLorean that was placed there by Doc, but also find out that Doc was killed by the vile outlaw Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson). So Marty goes back to 1885 to save Doc and then try and get back home in 1985.A great and terrific ending to the series and I always thought they could have just kept making these movies as long as they had the care that Zemckis and co-screenwriter Bob Gale brought to the projects. Unfortunately, due to Fox's Parkinson Disease it may never had a chance to happen. At the same time I am so happy these films were made. Like previous entries it injects wonderful humour, great characters, adventure and top notch music from Alan Silvestri.

Once more for old time's sake.,"After the brain-melting series of temporal twists and turns performed by Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) in Part II of the Back to the Future trilogy, the time-travelling pair keep it relatively simple for Part III, spending nearly the whole film in one place and one year: the wicked wild, wild west of 1885, where Marty meets his Oirish ancestors, Doc falls in love (with schoolteacher Clara Clayton, played by the lovely Mary Steenburgen), and both face mortal danger from gun-slinging outlaw Mad Dog Tannen (Thomas F. Wilson) and his gang.Considering that it was shot back-to-back with Part II, the lack of narrative complexity for the final chapter comes as a bit of a surprise, but does little to diminish the film's overall ability to entertain: Part III might be a less frantic affair, but thanks to an excellent script packed with witty dialogue, welcome character development, plenty of tips of the Stetson to the previous two films, and a rousing finale, it is no less enjoyable than its predecessors, thus making the whole trilogy one of the most consistently brilliant series of movies ever.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Go West and Going Home,"This is the final entry in a great sci-fi series, which I think is kind of an underrated sequel, yeah, it's not the best in the series in my book but it has merit, and unlike most movie and TV series it does what most fail to do, conclude on a positive note.The only misfires I have are the pacing comes off just a tad slow, mainly in the middle where not much really happens until the final half which makes the film less exciting. The soundtrack isn't that memorable well except on track by Alvin Silvestri but that's it, probably because country music isn't my genre. Which sort of gets to my other problem which is really just me, the Western genre just isn't my genre it's the same as how I feel about musicals, courtroom genres, and any others I don't get into highly, like there is a western or two I like mainly the TV shows ""The Young Riders"" and ""Guns of Paradise"" (both 80's shows) even the 80's cartoon show ""Brave Starr"" if you want to count it, but that's basically it. That's just how it is with lots of people there is some music or even sports they like or don't like, it's part of what makes us unique. So yeah, that one of the reasons I don't watch this entry too highly.Now that that's aside let's get down to business, I do like the plotline, honestly didn't mind the idea of taking it to the old west which was a different idea and kind of makes sense when you think about it going to the beginning of Hill Valley when both Hill Valley and America were still young and changing, innovations on the rise just budding into fruitation. But also, I like that fact that both the western and sci-fi genre mix, I always love a mix in genre which show you can do more with them. Let alone sci-fi westerns aren't something I see every day, the only ones I can think of are TV shows like ""Brave Starr"", ""Galaxy Rangers"", and movies like ""Outland"", and ""Cowboys and Aliens"" all underrated gems.Characters are good as usual, the back and forth between both Marty and Doc is intact. I really like how Doc Brown is a little more the main character of the film this time and for once Marty is more the supporting character, it makes sense having this switch since this is the final entry why not. Doc as usual is just hilarious he has some of the best comedic moments, my favorite is the whole dilemma with the alcoholic drink, I won't say anymore than that you just have to see it yourself it's hilarious.Marty is good as usual, I really like it when he interacts with one of his ancestors Shamus McFly whom is of course played by Michael J Fox, really liked Mike's performance as that character really bought this was a different person, he a bit of another mentor figure for Marty. However, in this film Marty has a subplot where he must learn an important lesson in not giving into dares and what true courage is about, which I thought was good and is somewhat a plot device for the final half of the film.And of course, Bufford Tannen this believe or not is my favorite incarnation of Biff he's as usually a fun dirtbag. His looks reflect his attitude where he is just dirty, grimy, and dangerous as he just seems to have a short fuse and trigger happy as he's ready to blow anyone away that tees him off. However, he's as usual idotic, as we see once again he does some dumb things that even a second grader can easily avoid, let alone intellectually poor as he doesn't even know one number that comes before or even after another.I like the new character Clara played by Mary Steenburgen, it's ironic considering she was in a time travel film in the 80's ""Time After Time"" another under the radar gem; so thats two in a row for her not bad. She's a highly intelligent woman whom is interested in science and curious about things in both science and life which makes both Doc and her a good match. The chemistry between both Clara and Doc is solid, I wouldn't say one of the best romances I've ever seen in my book, but I'd take this over any of those crappy ones from a soap anytime.I bought into it because the two were doing what most couples should do interact, though I think what makes this stand out is throughout both their relationship and the adventure Doc actually grows a little becomes a little more of a man as his confidence grows, like seeing him stand up to Bufford Tannen not even afraid as Tannen has a gun on him, it really shows strength in Doc that you can't break his spirit no matter what.There are once again some fun moments. Like seeing Marty in that shooting gallery sequence and seeing him shoot each of the targets and it's funny what he says at the end of that as well as using a pie plate as a frisbee. As well as most of the final half which was were most of the excitement was with the final showdown and the race Back to the Future.But it then of course comes down to the final minutes of the film that I found touch and kind of sad at the same time because it really assured us that this truly is the end of the series. Though I wouldn't fret too much if you want to see the expanded universe ""Back to the Future"" adventures there is the comic book series from IDW which are pretty cool. Other than that, I honestly felt this really was a satisfying conclusion to a great sci-fi franchise. I'm going to miss this series, but Marty and Doc have had their final time traveling adventure and rode away into the sunset, so farewell Marty and Doc where ever you go in life and time you never far away.Rating: 3 and a half stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Fun and watchable last entry...,"1st watched 12/19/2008 - (Dir-Robert Zemekis): Fun and watchable last entry in the ""Back to the Future"" series of movies. In some ways, I actually liked this movie more than the original. This movie provides the first time I ever noticed Christopher Lloyd given a chance to expand his character beyond typecasting and he actually does a very good job with it. His character is given a love interest, who is played by Mary Steenburgen, and he then becomes the main part of the story instead of the Michael J. Fox character. The plot is a twisted mess as usual as it is a time travel story and anytime people move back and forth in time you can never keep track of everything. Of course, this series of movies doesn't take itself very seriously and that's why it works. Its' fun to watch the characters even go so far as making fun of their original characters created in the first movie. An example, is an excellent scene where each character mimics the other by using the other character's patented line. After seeing this, we know we've come full circle in the series. Most of the time in this one is spent in the 1880's(the old west) with Fox's character penning himself as Clint Eastwood and this joke is carried throughout this time period. Doc is a blacksmith(aka. inventor) and their main purpose is getting him back to the future before he's killed in a gunfight. They have to find some way of making the Delorean time machine go at least 88 mph and they use a train to push it up to that speed(with the help of some invention from Doc, of course). Everyone lives happily ever after, as you'd expect, and the series ends on a positive note as far as the movie and how it was received, at least by me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A deserving finish.,"""Back to the Future Part III"" is a heartwarming finale to the iconic trilogy, blending science fiction with a Western twist that many find delightfully engaging. As the third installment, it offers a distinct shift in setting and tone, transporting Marty McFly and the beloved Doc Brown to the rough-and-tumble days of 1885. This time-jumping adventure not only provides the high-octane thrills expected but also weaves in a surprising layer of familial warmth that resonates deeply with viewers.The Western backdrop is richly rendered, offering both a visual treat and a playground for the story's more playful elements. From horseback chases to old-time saloons, the film captures the essence of the genre while maintaining the series' signature whimsical flair. However, it's the development of the characters and their relationships that really makes ""Part III"" shine. The dynamics between Marty and Doc are explored more deeply, providing a satisfying emotional core to the narrative.Clara Clayton, introduced as Doc Brown's love interest, initially seems to intrude on the tight-knit duo. Her character can feel somewhat forced into the storyline, striving to carve a space in an already established dynamic. Nonetheless, as the story unfolds, Clara's inclusion pays off beautifully, adding depth to Doc's character and culminating in a touching conclusion that ties up the trilogy in a meaningful way.Overall, ""Back to the Future Part III"" is a fitting conclusion to a much-loved series, capturing the spirit of adventure and the importance of connections through time. While it may have its minor flaws, the film ultimately delivers a satisfying end to the time-traveling escapades of Marty and Doc. Recommended for fans and newcomers alike, this film deserves a solid 7 out of 10 for its inventive plot and heartfelt execution.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
The wild west revisited,"Mediocre bookend to the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy ties up the loose ends but the repetitive formula is looking tired, laboured by a contempt that usually follows such familiarity. Fox is this time transported back one-hundred years to the wild west where he passes himself off as 'Clint Eastwood' attempting to save Doc (Lloyd) from a bullet from the perennial badman Biff (Wilson).Very distinguished cast co-stars Mary Steenburgen as Lloyd's love interest of the 1880's, sultry Elisabeth Shue again reprising her role as Fox's present-day GF and the likes of Richard A.Dysart, Matt Clark, Harry Carey, Jnr and Dub Taylor in minor roles; Lea Thompson also re-appears as Fox's present-day mother, and the woman who discovers him after his trademark knock-out shortly after arriving at his time-travel destination.Now familiar plot seems to almost go through the motions in an attempt to sign-off the series where arguably, it needn't have been revisited. Filmed back-to-back with Part II, though the plot contrives the second sequel, there's really nothing new here and I've always felt as if I was just re-watching the original film with temporally adjusted sets and wardrobe. Might make for a well appointed box set, but it's just passable as a stand alone feature.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"While not nearly as strong as the original, Part III concludes the trilogy very well","In a cliffhanger in Back to the Future Part II, Doc Brown gets transported to the year 1885 in the old west. So, Marty seeks help from the 1955 Doc Brown to help him and upon going to that decade, the infamous Mad Dog Tannen threatens to take Doc Brown's life. Will Marty save him and get him back to 1985? Will they destroy the time machine once and for all? Or will Doc Brown's love interest Clara changed his mind?Now that it's been thirty years, Back III, much like the last installment, is a good sequel. Yes it's not as strong as the original, and it does retread some of the elements from that film, but everything else is done very well. The 1885 setting version of Hill Valley (when compared to the 2015 and alternate 1985 aesthetics) is gorgeous and creative. The directing and editing is very good and the pacing is very good. Alan Silvestri reprises the music from the original film while providing a western style music when Marty travels back to 1885.The story, while a bit of a retread of the first, at least provides some interesting things this time around. The whole idea of having the McFly family born in the 1885 western setting as is Doc Brown having a conflict with Mad Dog Tannen provides fits. And plus having a love interest for Doc Brown is very nice with Mary Steenburgen giving a superb performance as Clara. Also, Thomas F. Wilson does a great job playing Mad Dog Tannen. Not to mention that it concludes the trilogy with no cliffhanger. And last but not least, the acting which is great with Michael J.

Mary Steenburgen snatches the role of the leading lady to whom Lloyd romances, while Lea Thompson and Elisabeth Shue are nearly nonexistent in their roles.

How cool is a refrigerator back in 1885?,"Other than The Lord of the Rings I can't think of another trilogy that tells a single story so well over multiple films. Every step of the time travel, whether backwards of forwards, is logically explained as life or death, and this jaunt to 1885 fits perfectly into the world of Doc Brown and his slacker apprentice. It was a great idea for the writers to include objects from various points in history so the characters, and the audience, can see the results of the antics the heroes get into immediately. Things like pictures of tombstones, newspapers, etc. allow the outcomes to be shown on screen without more exposition than is necessary. Hats off to Spielberg, Zemeckis and Gale for allowing the audience to join them on a 3 part adventure that will truly be timeless, and each generation will rediscover.

That accomplished, he goes back to 1985 and his wacky inventor visits the 21st century.In the 21st century, the wacky inventor learns that something terrible will befall Marty's son (Michael J.

He also casually mentions that if too many more impossible things happen then perhaps the whole universe (Michael J. Fox) will explode.  Luckily, it doesn't.  With pluck and daring, Marty succeeds in preventing the future tragedy that caused him to prevent it, but inadvertently changes the past so that the events of the entire first movie didn't happen, except that they did.

This has created a large amount of plot holes. These are holes, however, that are covered up by the important plot. Therefore, the problems are overlooked.

What a way to end a sequence like this,"I'm going to start this review by saying that I loved this trilogy. I really liked the way they wrap up the story and how the three films maintain their level. From the first to the last, all are good, none are bad. I really like the characters and their personal characteristics. The story of this last film is very good. What really caught my attention throughout the films is how Doc always manages to find a solution for them to return in every film and whether or not there is a certain logic behind it. For these reasons I give this film an 8. What a way to end a triology, absolutely excellent!",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
one more time,"I can't put my finger on it , but something about this 3rd entry , just didn't Mc ""fly"" for me,, maybe it was going into the way way way back machine 1885 to the old west, kinda got me way lost watching it,, I think maybe if they would have done say 1925-35 or so,, anyways,, it wasn't a terrible movie,, there are some nice old west moments and stuff, but this one was really hard to follow,, going from 1985-2015-1955-1885. think I got dizzy trying to keep the sequence of events straight in my head. Mary Steenburgen comes along in this last installment of the series,, I would really have to watch this 3rd installment at a later time to give everyone a more fair assessment of this movie,, loved the first two,, i'll have to give this one another look in a few years..",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Hardly a case of killing time.,"If you've managed to keep up until now don't panic we're nearly there. We start with Marty still trapped in 1955 and Doc doomed in 1885, Jennifer is asleep on the porch in 1985 and let's just agree to ignore 2015 for now! After Marty discovers that Doc is to die in 7 days – but 70 years ago – so it's off to the past; from the past; to get everyone back to the future, which is the past to 2015 I'm dizzy, wait a sec.In actuality this one is a little more straightforward than the previous two regardless of how I just made it look. Doc manages a romantic interlude with a local teacher played by Mary Steenburgen and Marty must once again deal with his various ancestors and those of Biff without impacting future events for his family.Given that the story is less intricate than the previous films they really do drag out the middle section and build up to the climax in this film, probably 20 minutes longer than they should. But given the achievements of the first couple films in the trilogy I am willing to forgive them.If viewed in isolation BttF 3 is by far the least of the three films, the plot is actually reasonably straightforward and just a couple of the nods to the previous/Future films a little forced, but when it all finally wraps up and Marty eventually makes it through that one day in 1985 one of the better trilogies of all time ceases. Definitely the best PG 13 trilogy this side of Toy Story, you really need to understand all the various time jumps, changes and consequences to understand just how creative it all is.Like the Millennium Trilogy of the last couple of years while the individual films are all at least quite good and at best excellent the completed trilogy is somehow much greater than the sum of its parts.Final Rating – 7.5 / 10. While BttF 3 is a little lacking by comparison it is still a pretty good film. Unfortunately you can't watch this and not compare At the risk of killing you with cheese the Back to the Future trilogy is one of the best film series of all time(s) between 1885 and 2015, and various spots in between.",7.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
If I were in the same Situation as the movie in 1885 I could have gotten Back to the Future in 10 minutes.,"OK... First I know that this was/is a movie and my plan would end the move in 30 minutes, but this is what I would do let me know if you agree...Gas tank in the car Marty drove to 1885 from 1955 has a full tank. Doc filled it in 1955. Gas line gets ripped all gas runs out.Doc - Patch the gas line. DO NOT use whiskey as fuel. In 1885 at that point there are 2 time machines there. The one Marty drove from 1955 and the one Doc put in the mine in 1885. That 1885 car should still have gas in it unless Doc drained it before putting it into storage.Get gas out of that car and drive back to the future...Another thing.

A classic western seen from the eyes of this trilogy is really beautiful but the plot is not very original and this penalizes the film a bit.

Clara who?,"A couple of users have pointed out that Marty can't have seen Clara's name on the tombstone, because she got saved as a result of Marty going back, so before he went back Doc wasn't there to save her life, and she died before he got shot.Not necessarily.She was driving through that area on her own because Doc had not come to pick her up at the station, which he would have done if Marty had not come and warned him to stay away from women named Clara. They probably still passed through the area, and the horses still got spooked, but on that timeline Doc was already riding in the wagon and in an even better position to save Clara's life and impress her.So it wasn't Marty going back that saved her, it was Doc going back. And before HE went back, Clara had noone to either pick her up or save her, so she died tragically and got the ravine named after her.Another possibility is that she ""originally"" died the same way at a later date. It may be that people are destined to die in a particular way, only the time can be changed. Think about it: Doc originally got shot by a libyan, then he got saved by Marty's warning, then he went back a century to get shot by Mad Dog, and once again saved by Marty. So time travelers can't change the way people die, only delay it. Which of course means both Doc and George are still destined to be shot by someone...",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

It was a mighty conclusion...too bad.,"I mean too bad as in 'Too bad this has to be the end', I mean, you all must of heard of the 4th script lying somewhere in Universal StudiosT picking up dust. (In case you don't know, the script is called 'Back to the Begining' and details a story where Marty meets the Doc when he is young but has a fatality in his family which causes Doc to think of time traveling back.) But it will probably never be taken to the screen so you will have to except this is a finale.But still, this is one 'heavy' movie. Where Marty goes to the old west to save Doc from getting shot but things go a little hey-wire since the DeLorean fuel line is torn thus no combustion can acure, sounds troublesome? probably so. So go see the movie and see how everything turns up.I consider this movie, infact, the entire trilogy as a land-mark in movie history and a thing with 'Cosmic Importance', if you don't know what I mean, I relate 'Cosmic Importance' to anything I feel that effected me beyond the first layer it was intended to and usually I pull it out some time after my first use and use it again and again and again...This movie was probably the weakest of the series but was...is a good film even though they crush the DeLorean, but not to worry, everything turns up fine.I recommend this movie to anyone who is someone, so go see it again and again and again and again and....well, you get the point.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Third time's a charm...,"BTTF3 is the last (to-date) movie in the BTTF trilogy, wrapping it all up neatly.

You have GOTTA see all the parts!Anyway, it is kinda sad to see Doc leave Marty (and the ""present"") and going where no man has gone before, but at least this is one trilogy which was actually fun all the way, and it never let up anywhere! Unlike the Alien-series, which is so bleak, and the Star Wars-series which is utterly boring, and the Lethal Weapon-series which finally runs out of gas, the BTTF-series is pure rock & rolling all-out fun from start to finish!As in all BTTF movies, once again the direction is superb, the casting is excellent (because it's the same), the performances are really fun (with the exception of the Jennifer Parker character, which I think Claudia Wells played better than Elisabeth Shue) and the whole thing is just darn fun!!

Back to the Future Part III (1990) Homage to the western,"The third film in the trilogy is the one that seeks to explore a theme that is much more different from the rest. Now, the idea is to explore the union of science fiction and the western. The narrative is very well developed based on this idea and manages to pay homage to this cinematographic genre very well. There are numerous references to Clint Eastwood and the film takes advantage of this to develop the story in many moments. The humor is very well inserted, especially when exploring cinema classics. When the film seeks to make references and jokes with the first, as the second did, it manages to do so in an effective way. The jokes with the original are more interesting because they serve more as a reference and are inserted in very different contexts, which makes it more fun, unlike the previous one which sought to use references all the time. The film is very fun and manages to explore this new theme very well in a very interesting way.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Everything matures nicely in this conclusion,"First of all, I'd like to say that I don't understand the many reviews I've read which criticize this film for taking on a Western element.  It makes a lot of sense (and is very exciting) to place emphasis on the time you've travelled to.  In the first film, there was a portrait, albeit a rough one, of 1950s middle-class American culture, in the second, a hypothetical future with all the colorful whiz-bang technology that was the vision in the 1980s, and in the final, the Old West--complete with costumes and catch phrases that seem awfully cliched now but were a lot newer in 1885.  The traits of the West (issues of absolute historical accuracy aside) were more deeply explored here than the other two environments were in their respective films--which I liked; it was nice to see some more emphasis on where they were rather than why they were there or how they could leave.  It pointed to some evolution in the role of Doc's time machine, going from scientific breakthrough to instrument of recreation.  That change provided some room for more thorough character development, particularly the Doc through the introduction of his love interest, but also Marty in an exposition of his strength of character--no longer the scared, bewildered kid he was in the first two films, he showed new attitudinal and intellectual resource.  I think growth was the overall theme here, a satisfying result of all the adventures.  As Marty said, ""It's been educational.""",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

"Weakest of the Series, but still Good","BTFIII is the worst of the great trilogy, but it is by no means bad.  While II is generally considered the worst, it holds up to repeated viewings much better than III.  This was also a departure from the other two, as it spends most of the time in the Wild West, and a lot of the pop-culture jokes and references are gone (though there are a fair amount).  It's still fun, and you get to see more of the Doc Brown character explored than in the others. If you haven't seen the trilogy, you'll need to watch it just to get the conclusion.  However, it's more of a stand-alone movie than II is, so it could be seen even if you're not familiar with the others.Overall, it gets a vote of 8 from me.  Watch it, but watch the other two first.

"Hey, an okay sequel !","I think with Another 48 Hours I listed several classic Hollywood sequel flops, a pretty easy task. I should have included, if I didn't, BTF II which was a terrible piece of trash. This one goes in a different direction as Lloyd, Fox and DeLorean take their act to the old West. Of course Biff's ancestor is there to make life miserable if not impossible for Fox. Steenburgen provides an unexpected and very touching bit of romance for Lloyd, while Fox amuses himself by going by the name of Eastwood. It's all good fun, climaxed by a wild if somewhat overdone train run. A young Shue works well as Fox's own love interest and the wrap up is fine.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Clint Eastwood was a legend much before he was born!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The final installment in the Back to the Future trilogy picks up where the second film left off, but it casts off the dizzying time travel of the first two films for mostly routine comedy set in the Old West.

Doc Brown reveals that he hid his DeLorean car/time machine in an abandoned mine outside town, and when Marty does some research and discovers that the Doc died shortly after writing the letter, he decides to find the car, travel back in time, and warn the Doc about his demise. Meanwhile, the Doc, who has fallen in love with a local woman (Mary Steenburgen), realizes he can't hide in the past from the problems he has caused to the time flow in the previous two adventures.

A Consistently Perfect Trilogy,"One thing Back to the Future has going for itself is the consistency. Having the same director on board and the same team of actors and actresses (for the most part) throughout managed to keep the series fresh and original throughout all three films. It's an extremely difficult feat, especially with the subject matter which, as I said in both previous reviews, would be extremely easy to pull off ineffectively.And yet, with Back to the Future Part III, we have the conclusion of an epic trilogy of films that may, perhaps, be the most likable films in cinematic history.This time, we get a film that takes place in the old west, and it's every bit as on point with the humor, action and heart as the original. There's not a single moment that's boring or that starts to drag. It's perfectly paced, as well acted as the previous installments, and it packs an emotional punch to add to the mix, which makes it a fantastic conclusion to a wonderful story.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Marty explains to the 1955 Doc what happened and shows him the letter. They read it and learn that Doc also gets shot by Biff's dangerous ancestor, Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen (Wilson). Doc helps Marty get back to 1885 and after Marty arrives calling himself Clint Eastwood, he's threatened by Buford).

« I would like to go to the old west » (dvd) (vhs) (screen),"Dixit Micheal J.

As I'm not a western fan, I underrate this while it's in fact very good: the characters really develop, Steenburgen is a nice addition and unlike BTF2, there's really a new universe to discover with the old west! The 2 Bobs prove once again how talented they are as they succeed to put all the western clichés and blend them nicely with their franchise! It's good that the franchise ends on a full circle (great idea the picture of the clock!) and gives full hope for the future! Like the predecessors, this movie has also paradoxes that die-hard fans notice easily: If not the wish of the production, Emma Thompson shouldn't have been part of the movie as she is another branch of the family!

The final film of the Back to the Future trilogy.,"Previously on Back to the Future. This is it! Finally it's the final chapter of the trilogy you all been waiting for. Whilst Part 2 was not as good as the first, the characters are the same and it still has the charm to it. Now I will know what I could think of the third one and I've watched this twice now. I watched it after I finish watching Part I and II and now III. With it I finally watched the entire trilogy in one day. Just like I did with the others of course. After the events of Part II while being stranded in 1885 during his time travel adventures, Marty discovers that his friend Dr. Emmett Brown is trapped in the year 1885. He was killed by Buford Tannen, played by Thomas F. Wilson, who is Biff's great-grandfather. Marty then travels to 1885 to rescue Doc and return once again to 1985, but matters are complicated when Doc falls in love with Clara Clayton, played by Mary Steenburgen. You can tell from the cover that it's taken place in the western world where there's cowboys and indians. Due to the fact that this is the final part of the trilogy I don't feel any perfections in this not to say that it's the weakest but to clear up the fact that this is a western but some sci-fi moments in it. It contains some same scenes that you've seen before, Marty McFly wakes up in Lorraine's bedroom thinking that this is a dream but he realise that he's in a different year it's not. In Part II he walks away from Griff and then he calls him chicken and he hates being called chicken. In this one he just he calls him yellow and he hates being called that too. You get all the rest. Now with new scenes which are ripping off pop culture references when Marty wakes up again thinking about dueling with Buford Tannen making references to Robert De Niro from Taxi Driver and Clint Eastwood (which he calls himself) from Sudden Impact. I like the train scene after Marty fights with Buford in the third act and I also like the ending of this film after when the DeLorean is destroyed just like Doc wanted. An ending to the trilogy is what I love about when it gets wrapped up even when it says ""THE END"". So that's it for the Back to the Future trilogy. I hope you stick with me throughout all this. I know it's been a long journey but it's worth it. I still the first one because it executes perfection, the second is similar in terms of scenes and time travel but does it differently and now the third one is the last of the franchise. Thomas F. Wilson stole the show from three films, he's funny, he's psychotic and his performance is charming and intelligent. There's a cartoon series after this which I haven't seen but you can watch in the bonus disc when you own the entire trilogy. And I guess that's a wrap at this rate. Back to the Future is over and done with.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant,"I think all the Back to the Future movies were great. In the 3rd part Marty goes to save Doc's life in the old west. Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen has murdered Doc Brown in 1885. Marty takes the time machine out and Delorean rides again. In 1885 Marty claims to be Clint Eastwood. Doc falls in love with a teacher called Clara and that makes going back to 1985 more difficult.It was great that they made BTTF 3 a western. The actors do a great job also in this one. New character is Mary Steenburgen, who is playing Clara Clayton. So this part is also good as all the parts of Back to the future trilogy.

BTTF III,"Everything comes together. A enjoyable conclusion to the trilogy. The wild west setting never gets old and is just as fun here to watch. Doc is great and this movie puts a greater focus on him for once after Marty took most of the screen time in the first two. Whilst the romance plot was beyond cheesy, it felt inline with the overall trilogy and it's general silliness. Thankfully imo this movie turns down the silliness a bit compared the the second movie, and besides the romance plot, felt more like the first.That said, I arrived at the point where I thought it was a bit too much of the good stuff to make pretty much 3 of the same movies right after another. The plot for all 3 is the same, they have to intervene in a dramatic event to alter the future and they manage to do it at the last second. It seems to be a running gag to repeat scenes but in a different time, like Marty waking up and calling for his mom. And this might be a side effect of binging the trilogy, but it does feel quite much to have so many repeated scenes and scenarios.There are a few things left to the imagination that are not as great. Most notably how Doc simply build another time machine, if that were a possibility then why all the drama of destroying the DeLorean? Doc contradicted himself making another timemachine again. So that was odd.All in all still enjoyable, but I hit it's limit of same problem, different time. Luckily it never exceeded that. The trilogy didn't end up having a huge impact on me, I haven't fallen in love with it. But they are just extremely fun, well made solidly build movies and that without a doubt is something you don't see much anymore. Especially a trilogy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Eighties Meets Old West,"Back to the Future III is an enjoyable mash up of all the old Wild Western tropes with nineteen eighties time travel fun.Christopher Lloyd steps up even more in the third installment of the movie series. Michael J Fox remains iconic, of course, but Doc gets to shine here with Mary Steenburgen playing his love interest.The story in this final third is less convoluted than the second, at least on screen, but perhaps that's because the double switch over plot happened in the second. Now we're just in the final stretch, coming home.We have wonderful, sweeping feels to the establishing shots. Great set pieces. Fun stunts with a lot of dust.This time the stumbling block with the travel home is a punctured gas tank, so we have doc trying to piece together how to get the car up to speed. (Thank heavens for advancing 1880s technology.)Just as in the other Back to the Future installments, the show is a fabulous popcorn muncher and a great way to spend a couple of hours.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
This is how you end a trilogy,"A perfect ending for a legendary trilogy I'll always remember.

The Character Genius,"I think of the three parts of the saga (BTTF) I think part three was the best, to take the duo back to the 1800's, and the way Doc had a letter sent to Marty from 1885, I mean in geinus and hiding the time machine for him to find. I like most of all the way they used the different characters played by the same actors like Mad Dogg, Biff, Griff and Oldman Biff were all played by the same actor and Marty, Martin, Old Man Marty, and Shamis McFly were all played by M J Fox. But the shame was there were no relatives of Doc Brown, no children or parents just the same person.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Let's save the future in the past,"It rarely happens that the films of one trilogy look equally strong both individually and together. The films of Robert Zemeckis, fortunately, are an example of how exciting each of the films can be, absolutely not inferior to the other.""Back to the Future 3"", like the previous ones, makes you immediately go into a string of events that literally overwhelms the main characters. However, the fact that the main character in this film is Dr. Brown immediately catches the eye. In the previous two films, the focus was still shifted to the story of a young Marty McFly, whose future and past were in danger. Here, actor Christopher Lloyd perfectly shows how his hero turns from a good-natured, slightly stupid doctor into a man who, having met his love, is ready to fight for her to the very end. Here Lloyd perfectly demonstrates how romantic Dr. Emmett Brown can be.The main idea of this film, I see the idea of how important it is to be ready to sacrifice for the sake of the future. The heroes perfectly demonstrate that in the pursuit of happiness, they are ready to go to great lengths to save their loved ones.It is also funny that a fantastic movie acquires the distinct features of a western. Even frank references to Clint Eastwood do not bother anyone. It all looks funny, starting from the moment when Marty is called by the name of a great actor, and ending with the use of some tricks from Eastwood's films.As in previous films, Tanon shone in this one. But this time it was already the great-great-great-grandfather of a famous character from the first part of the trilogy. He is an undisguised antagonist who has classic stupid henchmen, but he himself reveals himself as a dangerous rival primarily for Doc Brown. In previous films, there was a confrontation between Tanon and McFly.Closer to the finale, you realize with sadness that an interesting story is coming to an end, and there's nothing you can do. So I want to see the new adventures of my favorite characters on the screen.Robert Zemeckis gave a wonderful movie for all time. It will be watched through generations and by the whole family, because it is an amazing world showing friendship, love and of course great adventures.9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Marty & Doc visit the Old West,"Released in 1990, ""Back to the Future Part III"" stars Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly, a teen who travels back to 1885 to save his friend, Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd). Mary Steenburgen plays a woman that catches Doc's eye in the Old West while Lea Thompson plays a McFly ancestor. Thomas F. Wilson returns as the villain, both as Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen and Biff, while Elisabeth Shue returns as Marty's girlfriend. There are also numerous Western icons featured in peripheral roles.On paper this should've been a great ending to the trilogy and I expected it to be. Unfortunately, the filmmakers didn't take advantage of the great possibilities of Marty & Doc being in the Old West and the movie bogs down in the second act with several dull sequences. So it's definitely the least of the trilogy, but there's enough good here to make it worth catching for fans of the franchise. There are several amusing bits and the ending is worth waiting for. NOTE: To appreciate this installment it's mandatory to watch the two prior movies first.The film runs 118 minutes and was shot in Jamestown, Port Hueneme, Oxnard, South Pasadena, Pasadena, El Monte, Ventura County, Sonora, Universal City and Los Angeles, California.

A satisfying end to the Trilogy,"This film, while not as good as the first Back to the Future film, provides a satisfying end to the Trilogy.  It's excellent acting, interesting plot, and fun attitude even manage to redeem the second, dreary film that rehashed so much of the original.  I am generally not a fan of westerns, but BTF III manages to combine a humor, adventure, and a touch of sci-fi while retaining the spirit and sense of fun found in the first film.  The cinematography is excellent as is the musical score.  The effects, brilliant for their time, are still quite effective.  BTF III has been dismissed as inferior to the first two - but if you're curious - I urge you to give it another look. It is well up to Robert Zemekis' high standards.",9.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"10/10, underrated and fantastic","The first movie was so good, and the 2nd, although worse was still amazing. The 3rd was the one I was least excited for, re-watching. I really don't know why though, I like westerns, I just didn't remember it that well and didn't remember liking it nearly as much as the 1st or 2nd, but oh god was I foolish. This movie is one of my favorite sequels of all time, and the jokes are very witty. There is one line, specifically that if you have watched the film, you probably know and I was dying when I first noticed it. It probably has the most thrilling sequence out of all of them, and that is really saying something. Overall this is such a great film and if you are skeptical, because some of the reviews are negative and you have seen the first two, I think you will enjoy it, maybe even more than the 2nd.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Largely forgettable,"Well, I saw the first two ""Back to the Future"" films long ago, and they were cute, a bit fluffy, and mildly entertaining. Really had little desire to see this one. But, I finally did, and found it to be largely forgettable. I only watched it because Mary Steenburgen was added to the cast, and her sad-eyed beauty makes almost anything better. That is the case here. There are a few plot holes/time-travel paradoxes, but you cannot complain too much about that, as this is sort of the nature of time-travel movies. The production values were fine, and I'm sure it was fun to make, but there isn't much to recommend it, aside from the aforementioned Ms. Steenburgen.",5.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

Good finish to the story with a few minor drawbacks,"Marty time travels to 1885 to find Doc.This is a strong finish to a great movie trilogy, but for me it's the weakest entry of the three.The story goes back to the simpler themes of the original movie with a single adventure, the same problem to overcome and a heavy dose of romance. This is all done very well but the formula at times feels slightly tired. That being said, if I was writing the script I don't think I could think of a better narrative.Just like the previous movies there are plenty of memorable scenes, particularly all the ones set in the saloon and everything involving Buford 'Mad Dog' Tannen.The Western setting is an inspired idea and once more we see the town of Hill Valley brought to life from another great temporal perspective. Along with this is a nice dose of Western humour and homage to Western movies.Generally the comedy is great, with a good mix of banter and sight gags. Marty and Doc have fantastic chemistry as always and when Tannen shares the stage it's even funnier.At the risk of sounding like a cynic or quite unromantic, I have to admit to disliking the romance story. I find Clara a fairly annoying damsel in distress who spoils the dynamic between Marty and Doc. This for me adds nothing to the trilogy other than a rather contrived means of giving one character a Disney-style happy every after. I like seeing Doc in 'mad-professor' mode and being overly scientific, but not as a romantic lead. It does not spoil my overall enjoyment of the movie, but her presence feels slightly out of place.The action spectacle and visuals are as strong as everything else in the trilogy. There are a number of exciting moments with great editing and sound effects.I like the music which uses the main franchise theme strongly along with a new more Western sounding original soundtrack. The appearance of ZZ Top is also good fun.All performances are strong as ever, with Michael J Fox and Christopher Lloyd on great form, but for me Thomas F Wilson steals the show whenever on screen. Mary Steenburgen does her best, but her character is for me not the most welcome to the franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A return to more assured storytelling,"After the pained opening and inventing re-imagining that was the second movie in the franchise, Marty and Doc return for their final outing with a more straightforward time travel adventure in line with the first one. From beginning to end, this is much more confident and assured storytelling on the part of Robert Zemeckis, standing on its own far better than the previous film while also giving Doc a surprisingly effective little love story.Writing the second and third movie together, and filming them back to back, greatly advantaged the third film over the second. The second was saddled with a jokey ending from the first that was never meant to be followed up, but the second movie was designed to actually lead into a specific adventure in the third. In addition, the two Bobs treated the second movie as the opening act to the third movie, introducing character elements and plot points that would resurface and resolve in that final film. Some of that ended up feeling out of place in Part II (like the ""chicken"" character trait that went unresolved there and the clip from A Fistful of Dollars that seemed completely gratuitous), but they end up working far better in Part III.So, Marty watched Doc erupt into nothing and disappear in the skies before finding out that he had been sent back in time from 1955 to 1885. Using a seventy year old note written by Doc as a guide, Marty recruits the 1955 version of Doc to help him find the DeLorean that 1885 Doc hid in a mine shaft, get the time machine back up and running, and then goes straight back to 1885 to save Doc from his fate of dying less than a week after he sent the letter.One of the joys of the franchise is how self-aware the films are about their formula and structure. There are several very specific things that happen in every film, and seeing them repeated in different contexts and variations is amusing. A Tanner saying, ""McFly!"" in a drinking establishment to Marty, confusing him with another member of his family, the chase through the streets of Hill Valley, the reappearance of characters and their antecedents like Strickland, and the central location of the clocktower provide a familiar base through all three films. Beyond that, in particular the first and third movies tell very similar stories where Marty goes back in time and needs to get help from Doc in order to go back forward in time, and here's where the variations become interesting.In the first movie, Doc was the crazy scientist with dreams of grandeur, worries of his own failure, and concern for the space-time continuum. In the third movie, Doc gets lovestruck, and it's amazing how well it works. Clara Clayton, the new schoolteacher in Hill Valley, arrives in the week that Marty and Doc are organizing their return home, and Doc is immediately smitten. Attractive, a bit older, and in love with both science and Jules Verne, Clara is the one woman in all of space and time, it seems, who could bring out more from Doc than rationality. They're endearing together, and they provide the emotional bedrock on which the movie's final half really operates. Marty remains the character with little more than a goal while Doc gains an emotional attachment and arc that moves him into becoming a different person by the end. That's not to say that Marty doesn't actually grow in this film, because he does. The ""chicken"" bit that was leaned on heavily in the future segment of the second movie finally moves beyond a random character trait suddenly inserted into Marty, it actually becomes a place where Marty will examine himself and grow over the film, and it's handled surprisingly well especially in his interactions with Seamus (both played by Michael J. Fox in a series of increasingly complex composites that must have been a devil to work through in the late 80s and early 90s).Marty does what he always does in these movies and becomes the focus of ire on the contemporary Tannen, in this case Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen. Marty shows up into town wearing a pink and blue cowboy getup that sticks him out like a sore thumb. Attracting Tannen's attention because of the outfit and his resemblance to Marty's great-great-grandfather Seamus with whom Tannen has issues, Marty gets shot at, lassoed, and nearly hung until Doc comes to the rescue with a tricked-out rifle. Together, Marty and Doc get to work finding a way to get the DeLorean to get to the necessary eighty-eight miles per hour after Marty accidentally cut the car's fuel line when he first arrived over rough terrain and in a chase with a local tribe. Eventually, they settle on robbing a train, getting the boiler up to an explosively hot degree, and riding out the extreme speeds until the car can get up to the necessary speed and appear on a bridge that will be built eighteen months after they leave but ninety-nine years before they arrive.Another of the movies' joys is how well plotted they are, in particular the first and third. The rules of time travel, the method, and the means are very clearly laid out, but it never feels like a boring exposition dump (part of that is Christopher Lloyd's constantly manic performance as Doc Brown where even when he's explaining things, he always seems like he's about to explode providing a surprising amount of tension). At the same time, the stakes of the effort are really clear. In this case, if the two don't make it to the train on time, then Mad Dog will kill one or the other. If they don't get the train up to eighty-eight miles per hour, then the time machine will just fall over into the gorge below. With these very clear practical stakes, it combines especially well with Doc's emotional stakes. The final movements of his story with Clara feel earned and satisfying.It seems to be that the general consensus is that the movies descend slightly in quality from one to the next with the first being the best, the second film as second best, and the third dead last. I just can't agree. The first has a purity of action and narrative that neither of the two quite meet, but the second is, well, as I wrote, the second is a mess. The third, though, is a wonderful adventure that provides a new dimension to Doc and a rather firm close on the franchise at the same time. Reading Roger Ebert's two and a half star review, he complains that the film decides to take a more romanticized view of the Old West than something like McCabe and Mrs. Miller by Altman, and I just don't quite get it. The point isn't to find a new way to tell a story in the Old West, it's to find a new way to tell a Back to the Future movie. It's a celebration of the Western genre up to and including visual cues from Once Upon a Time in the West, the presence of Harry Carey Jr, Pat Buttram, and Dub Taylor, and the use of Clint Eastwood as Marty's moniker. This is Back to the Future in the Old West, and it works as that but also as vehicles for our two central characters.It's amusing to think that the entire trilogy takes place over about two weeks of Marty's life, squeezed into about a day of real time from the start of the first film to the end of the third. Marty sees a lot, experiences a lot, and does actually end up growing and changing, and I think that Part III represents a wonderful way for Marty to complete his time travel adventures. I agree with Bob Gale that there shouldn't be any more of these movies. I do dread the moment that both he and Zemeckis die because their estates are going to sell the rights as fast as possible and we're gonna another hit of 80s nostalgia with a Back to the Future remake where the main character teenage has to go back to 1985. Until then, we have the original trilogy that is chockful of high-energy fun.",10.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A bit lackluster,"Apparently time travel has become so mundane, so commonplace now for Marty McFly that it doesn't really even faze him that he has been sent back to the wild west. Fox looks bloated and bored in this one, and the story is obviously wearing thin. Also, Biff Tannen provided such a wonderful villian in the first two, why not try something new? Nope. Instead we have ""Mad Dog"" Tannen saying (from across the saloon) ""Hey McFly!"". Sorry, but what was fresh in the first one and somewhat fresh in the second is now stale here. That being said, there is still some fun to be had. The train sequence is Grrreat!!! Marty is peculiarly droll and mellow in this one (why?) but it works occasionally for some laughs (""Frisbee! Far out!""). The Doc love story is nice too. It's not awful, it's just ho hum-- kind of a fizzle-y way to end the series...or is it the end after all???",8.0,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Least of the three but still an 8 out 10,"The Back To The Future trilogy is by far one of not the best trilogy of any movie franchise.

The rest of the movie is pretty much the same as the previous ones. Gotta get back to the future.I am also really weary of time travelling movies as they can be used as a weak writing tool when a writer hits a wall, time travel will solve it all.

A GREAT CONCLUSION TO A FANTASTIC TRILOGY!!!,"""Back to the Future part III"" is one of those movies that you hate to see end fearing you will never see those characters again. I felt so bad at the end knowing this was going to be the last i've seen of Marty McFly and good ol' Doc Brown I tell ya it was like seeing two of my closest friends leave. Thank god for their brief reunion on ""Spin City"" last season this the western of the three and the most enjoyable western i've ever seen.I loved the way the 3 movies focused on love and Doc and Marty's friendship the first focusing on Marty's parent's relationship the second on Marty's own relationship with Jennifer Parker and the third on Doc and Clara's relationship. The movie works in all merits Romance,comedy,Drama it's all there I especially loved the scene with Doc and Clara disscussing Jules Verne which showed us a side of Emmett Brown we never saw before and the scene with the train speeding up the DeLorean. Not to mention Tom Wilson's memorable villain Biff's great grandfather Bufford""Mad Dog""Tannen.The only problem I had with the movie like another IMDB member pointed out was that Doc and Marty just shook hands at the end knowing that they will probably never see each other again they should've at least hugged. Other than that the movie like it's predeccessors is highly reccomended.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
A fitting end to an entertaining trilogy.,"Back to the Future Part III (BTTF 3) is nothing but a western, happening to feature Marty McFly and Doc Brown. There's nothing wrong with this, but fans were probably hoping for a fast paced adventure featuring all four time zones (1885,1955,1985 and 2015) instead of this carefully paced adventure. Serving as an character building movie, BTTF 3 gives the audience a more detailed impression of what's going on inside the Doc's and Marty's head. Mary Steenenburger makes an appearance as the Doc's love interest, and it's great to see how the Doc and Marty's personalities have changed. There's some nice scenes, but the film appears to plod along at some points, and just lacks the whimsy and comedy found in the first installment. The finale is grand however, a great sequence involving an antique train and the Delorean time machine. And the conclusion of the film is fun, but pratically confirms the fans fears: BTTF Part 4 isn't a likely prospect....",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Cliche,"In the so-called ""glory days"" of the Old West, the 'good guys' wore white hats and the 'bad guys' proved their ultimate stupidity by wearing all black in the scorching heat.  Back to the Future Part III is a return to those roots in a very un-original and un-exciting fashion.  Robert Zemeckis' talent that was so boisterous in the first two movies has fallen into a layman's movie that anyone else could have made.  Too bad it took Death Becomes Her to reboot his system as to where it belonged.The story is the first problem, the plot is so ridiculously awful that it tarnishes the original beyond belief.  Second, Christopher Lloyd is wasted for the first time in a fruitless position.  In the original, he was the wacky inventor.  In the second, he was the worrisome custodian of the space-time continuum.  Here he is the melodramatic sap.  Michael Fox isn't much better as he, once again, proves that he's only good for laughs.While not as gizmo-happy as the second movie, the effects leave much to be desired.  Even the period of 1885 is not represented well.  It is all a bunch of gags and cliches that we have seen before many other times.  I preferred the sci-fi parody of 2015 instead, but I'm not a Western aficionado.The editing, yet again, is underdone and the script stumbles along in the middle third of the movie.  The camerawork isn't as inventive, but Zemeckis never has been a big stickler about what he projects.  Only in Forrest Gump has he been so concerned about that.  Finally, Alan Silvestri's score is so inferior this time around.  The previous films had a resonance similar to Predator, but The Abyss will remain my favorite compilation on his part. Unfortunately, none of that magic is here.  If only it were, how beneficial it would have been...Overall, the weakest link in the trilogy.  Why is it these movies only get worse as time goes on?  2 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"

"""They saved the best trip for last, but this time they may have gone too far""","The second film took over four whole years to come out, this film must have been REALLY desperate, since it was released just six months after part II. This film takes place exactly where the last one ended, with Doc unconscious in 1955. Doc decides to visit his favorite era of all, ""The old west"". Right when they're ready to leave, Marty screams, and finds out that Doc was killed back in 1885 by Bufford (Mad Dog) Tannen, who was a brutal, outspoken gunman who killed 12 men. I liked this conclusion better than part I, but not as well as part II. There's no ""Johnny be good"". There's great action, and grim gun fighting. There's less comedy here than in Part I and II. Doc falls for school teacher, Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen) and isn't so sure he wants to go back in time after all. In fact he saves her, when her horse is about to fall off a mountain, and altered history! The film runs 118 minutes, but seems shorter. I like movies where runty people square off against grim, unstoppable bad guys, and fortunately there's more of that than in the other BTTF movies. Bufford even has some knucklehead in his blood, and says equally funny, stupid things like ""I'm gonna hunt ya down like a duck."" another good quote, Doc saying he read 20, 000 leagues under the sea as a boy when it was recently published back then. The climax at the end is more suspenseful and would be more scary to do than before. The film finally comes to a conclusion, and we're finally back in the real world, where it seems like years they'd been gone, when it was only part of a day. Maybe you could tell me what happens, but I was dissapointed how I, but maybe you, found out wheteher Doc never came back and stayed in 1885, or took Clara to 1985 and stayed there.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
One of the 3 best.,"Of all three of the movies, I saw this one last. I think at times it seemed to stand still and not go anywhere, like when they started to talk about Doc staying in 1885 and the Party just seemed like a filler, just something to fill the movie up with. The best moments where in 1955 and after they saved Clara. It was a good movie, but it didn't really appeal to me the way the other two did.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Brilliant conclusion,"This film was slower paced than the other 2, we had time to breath (especially after the manic part II).  Definitely the best of the three.  This film had more heart, a better storyline and a very exciting finale.  Thomas F. Wilson played the best characters in the series and is certainly entertaining here.  It's imperative to see the 1st two before watching this.Great stuff!",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Best thing about the Back to the Futures...,"is finding the faults.  I enjoyed all three quite a lot, and they rank up there as one of my top trilogies.  However, it amazes me how some of the obvious blunders got by everyone who watches it.  The biggest mistake kinda kills the whole third movie.  Back to the Future II ends with Doc getting sent to the old west and III starts with Marty getting a note from doc saying he stashed the time machine away for 70 years so Marty can go home. So, what does he do, he goes to find Doc.  YOU GO MARTY!!!  But, alas, as only Marty can, he breaks the time machine when he arrives in 1885.  Lucky for Marty though is now Doc can uncover the one he stashed away, for Marty to use 70 years later, and they can go home.  Ooopppsss...Doc is so absent minded that instead of just getting the time machine out from the hole he left it in, he wanted to derive a completely new plan that involved pushing the broken Dolorian with a train.  Well, sometimes the route best taken is the one where you have to work much harder than you had to.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
good finale,"Us BTTF fans hated to see it end, but it had to sometime as Marty ventures to the old west to rescue Doc from being gunned down.  Though Id rank this the third best in the series, that is in no way saying its bad.  The writing is still strong, the action is still very good and the characters likable as always.  Like with part II there are a handful of scenes reminiscent of the first film (""Mom is that you?"", a chase out of the local hangout, spinnning license plate, etc.).  The difference here is that time travelling is out of the question with a disabled DeLorean, with the main focus being finding a way to get it moving fast enough to beam them back.  They figure out a scheme that could work, but both Marty and Doc must avoid certain death if they wanna make it happen.  As with the other two films, nothing goes smoothly with several complicating factors finding their way in. The biggest one, Doc falling in love with a school teacher (Steenburgen).  And no matter what time zone your in, theres always trouble with Biff, who this time is represented by his uncle, Buford.  The conclusion nearly matches part 1 for drama, with an extremely exciting race down a railroad track on a hijacked locomotive.  The only real disappointing moment came in the last five minutes, with Marty and Doc just ho-hummingly shaking hands to say goodbye. After all they've been through, they couldnt at least hug?  Seemed a little impersonal, but not a huge misstep, so not too much harm done.  Good ZZ Top song ""Doubleback"" used as the theme and of course the great Alan Silvestri provides another terrific score.  And I am like others whod love to see the series continued someday, but unfortunately it would take something really special to do that.  So I never get close to holding my breath about seeing film histories two most famous time travellers back in business.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Felt like I was seeing it for the first time...again,"The other day I watched this film for what has to be AT LEAST the fourth time,but probably for the first time in eight years. Even though I knew how it went,had a pretty good idea of the sequence of events and even some of the jokes,watching it again(this time on premium cable)still gave me a flood of emotions that one usually gets from watching a movie the first time,only this time with the sentimental melancholy of the knowledge of real time passing. Strangely,that might have actually ENHANCED my experience with this.Originally meant as the end part of ""Back to the Future,Part II"",but broken off because when director Robert Zemekis,producers Steven Spielberg and Bob Gale realized that they had too much movie in the can to put out as one release,they split this series off into its own film(a fact that I've become a little skeptical of over the years since). Number Three's actually a little bit better than the over-stuffed,over-ambitious 2nd part of the McFly Time travel saga,since the use of anachronistic time-displacement of both Marty(Michael J.Fox) and Doc Brown(Christopher Lloyd)--in this case the Old West of 1885 rural California,seems to be closer to the true spirit of the 1985 blockbuster original. All the usual elements are in place from the previous movies(particularly the bullying element,supplied by the always capable Thopmas F.Wilson,this time as Bad Biff's ancestor,Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen),and an added love interest for the normally reclusive Doc in the form of a delicate librarian named Clara(Mary Steenburgen),all moves seamlessly enough. One may question the specifics of this film,as per any of the series(or any time travel movie in general),but one who gives in to the charm,humor and kinetics of this Zemekis-Spielberg creation will not be disappointed. Aided by the always huge,welling music score of John Williams,this movie closes the story of time travel fixing(and un-fixing)the lives of the two principles of this story.I watch any of these three movies with some sense of sentimentality and bittersweet. This one in particular,makes me feel both entertained and yet sad. This really WAS a concluding sequel,and with the star players getting older(particularly Fox,who himself was already twenty-eight when filming this movie and was done with playing the kind of clean teen roles he'd been famous to up to that point)and such a memory attached to the players involved,there was no right way to either continue the series with OR without them.I seem to recall a short-lived animated series was created that was easily forgotten. Maybe someday in the future,someone will want to remake this again and be able to do it without stepping on the toes of those(like myself)who enjoyed the originals as greatly as we did. I have my doubts anyone can,but who knows.But as for seeing Marty,Doc Brown and a certain DeLorean fight off both Tannen and his thugs and righting some serious time travel blunders,this is still a glorious viewing experience that can make you feel young again. Being someone who recalls movie viewing in theatres(occasionally on video)from his youth with nearly photographic clarity,I can honestly say that watching this again I couldn't recall much about the experience around this movie,but I do recall how good this film made me feel specifically. How many films can you say that about?",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
dry powder,"This is an unnecessary film. It carries a dose of nostalgia and emotions for fans of the previous back to the future films, in which i include myself, but that's its only edge. You'd need to know and relate to the characters from the other films in other to mildly appreciate this one, and that is not a very good sign.Zemeckis/Gale are not genius, or masters of their craft. They started in the shadow of Spielberg fantasy business. But the first two Bttf were novel in the pace they gave to their comedy development. It's how everything juxtaposes that the fun lies. The second film does something even better, and unseen, which is to literally place a film over another. That was great, and the best narrative achievement these guys did.This one brings nothing new or interesting. Yes we still have the energy and amazing vitality of Michael J. Fox and Chris Lloyd, and, even due to more shared screen time, they probably pair better here than on the previous two. But there is no catch, the related characters (Biff, the McFlys) are just direct mirrors to the future ones. The edge is gone. They probably had studio pressure to do this, but they knew they didn't have much more to say. And the prove is that i've recently re seen the trilogy and this one is old and worn out and not funny anymore, unlike the other two.My opinion: 2/5http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
It couldn't be better...,Back to the Future (Part III) is the best episode in the series. It very good that Marty and the Doctor have changed roles. Instead of using high-tech and other references to pop-culture; we can now see a movie that explores more the souls of the caracters. Great spoofs in the Wild West. It gets an 18 out of 20.,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"The final BTTF, thankfully","Since this movie was made along side with BTTF Part II, it also lacks what made the original great.  But this time, Marty and Doc don't do several trips through time like in the original but instead end up trapping themselves in the old west.  While Doc falls in love, Marty (AKA Clink Eastwood) has to deal with bully Biff's great ancestor Buford ""Mad Dog"" Tannon.The movie doesn't have any of the side characters in the original move except briefly, but the actors of those characters play their great ancestors in the old west.  The lack of Biff is noticable, as Buford isn't really the same.  And the Wild West presented in this movie is quite far from realistic.  But no matter, BTTF 3 wraps up all plot lines and closes of the BTTF trilogy for good.  Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, just not that good.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
An awesome movie!,"I loved this movie, it was the best one of all The Back To The Futures.A perfect Wild west film, for people who like Wild west movies, and also having Emit and Clara fall in love was nice, I've seen this movie a lot of times.Except I've seen the TV edited version so some bad words are edited out of the TV version, and Marty using an alias name like Clint Eastwood was a nice touch.Mind as well just have a different name, even though it seemed like Shamus (Sp) knew that Marty was related too them, because he said too Maggie it felt like he was connected to them, and the train scene was awesome, but I bet that now the special affects would be better now then they were back in 1990.LuvzHannah",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
The third time is the charm,"Continuing the tradition of the ""Back To The Future"" trilogy, we have the last of three excellent films.With each film in the trilogy we have seemed to pick up an addition the main cast. The second film saw introduction of Marty's girlfriend Jennifer and the finale saw Clara Clayton, a love interest for ""Doc.""The film was set in the 1885 old west, which was a great change. I don't think I would have liked it as much if it was set in 1885 and a regular setting as the viewers witnessed in the first two films.I'm glad I saw this film because it continued to have the same great elements as the first two with the same dialogue and scenes but crafted in such a way that was unique to the trilogy.I was sorry to see the trilogy come to an end but as the cliche goes all good things must come to an end. I wonder what could have happened if there was a fourth film.If there is anyone who has not seen any of the films in the trilogy, they are missing out on a great piece of nostalgia.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
They're back for a great finale.,"***Starring: Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Mary Steenburgen, and Thomas F. Wilson.The movie picks up where Part II leaves off.  Doc is stuck back in 1885, the Old West, and Marty goes back to the past to save him, before he gets stuck in the Old West. The movie is very funny and takes some good old jokes from the first two, and make them a little better.  Of course, you have Biff (I guess I should say Buford) in maneur.  The movie's franchise has plenty of hot gas to have made some more sequels, but the ending makes sure that it will never happen again.  This franchise is just like the Ghostbusters franchise, you want more of them, but you just don't get them (something that the Friday the 13th series just shouldn't get).  The movie is a great way to end a great trilogy.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
RE: Clara going BTTF with doc and marty,"I do not know if anyone ever caught this before and posted it on this board but here it is,in Back to the future 3, marty said to doc when he started to fall for clara, I don't know doc, why don't we take her with us? and doc said, I cautioned you not to use time travel for your own benefet and I must do the same.Well it makes sense to me that because doc saved the life of a woman who was meant to die, then she is now his responsibility, and if he did leave her behind then she or her children or grandchildren could have serious reprocusions on future events, which is exactly what doc has been trying to avoid, so the smart thing to do is take her with them and keep her out of histories way.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Great movie,"Of course the first was the best, but frankly i hated Nr. 2 and all in all the one movie off the trilogy that i can watch over and over is this one. There are so many zany moments in it. (""Where have you learned shooting like that? -  7-11!!!)and Michael J. Fox's tribute to Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone is absolutely funny, not to mention the cameo appearance of ZZ-Top Grrrreat movie.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Great Movie,"BTTF3 is a good closing of the trilogy. Although I have to say it's probably the weakest of the three, that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. All the actors portray their characters with the usual greatness, and I especially love the climax of the movie where Doc and Clara get stuck on the train. I also thought the ""Jules & Verne"" thing was really cute.....ooops, I better not give away all of the secrets to the movie! Although BTTF is really sci-fi, Western fans can enjoy this one, too. All-in-all, a great way to end an excellent trilogy. You have to see BTTF3.-2001RulzP.S.-Although I love all the BTTF movies, I really hope they don't make a BTTF4. I mean, what could they possibly make it about? I think it would be a major waste of time and money, and it would be one heck of a job getting the original actors to come back. And I'm sure the almost-40-year-old Michael J. Fox is willing to play a teenager again......Just keep things the way they are now. BTTF4 would lack original material and wouldn't appeal to the rather dumb majority of teens today. Nowadays, almost every teenager wants a movie with violence, sex, cussing, and really hot guys & babes. And BTTF (fortunately) does not have these things. As a great man once said, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it."" Thanks. :-)",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Marty and Doc in the Wild West,"This is the third and final story to the ""Back to the Future"" series.  I can really say that this one is without a doubt my favorite of the three.  In this story, Doc Brown goes back to 1885 Hill Valley (and later Marty).  In this film, the bad guy is outlaw Beauford ""Mad Dog"" Tannen, Biff's great-grandfather.  He gets things mixed up as well as Biff like when he says ""I'll hunt you down like a duck!"" to Marty.  One of his colleagues tells him that it's ""Hunt you down like a dog.""  One part that I thought was funny was the scene at the square dance.  Marty picks up an empty pie plate that has ""Frisbee"" printed on it.  He then says ""Frisbee! Far out!""  His Irish ancestors, Seamus (pronounced Shay-Mus) and Maggie look at each other and Seamus says ""What was the meaning of that?""  Maggie replies ""It was right in front of him!""  After Beauford get arrested, Marty goes back to the year 1985 and the train destroys the time machine on the Eastwood Ravine, changed from the Clayton Ravine after Marty goes back in time. (Marty told the people of 1885 that his name was Clint Eastwood.)  At the end of the movie, Clara Clayton (the woman who Doc fell in love with) and Doc Brown are married and have two children of their own named Jules and Vern.(Wonder where those names came from)",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Can't wait to be in the future...,"I just finished watching the trilogy again. I wish I could go a couple of years into the future. Because then I could watch the trilogy again with a lot of nostalgia. I hope a DVD version is soon avialable in a special edition, the least. Because VHS isn't capable of playing this trilogy for the next... till the end of times.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
the grand finale!??,"I'm not a fan of Westerns, so BTTF3 isn't among my favorite of films.  But since it's the finale to one of my beloved trilogies, I often watch it after the other two for a sense of closure.We aren't treated to much time-hopping paradoxes here as in the first two--and that's where the main fault lies.  Suddenly, the movie isn't nearly as inventive as the first two because of that missing element.  It resorts to cliches of the Old West (saloon hostilities, shootouts at high noon, hey, Marty introduces himself as Clint Eastwood) instead of its creative time-warp adventure.  The sense of urgency is lost here, as there's no chance Marty will run into himself. However, it's not a bad film in its own right, since we love the characters by now and we desperately want them to get themselves out of this one final mess.An interesting paradox surfaces early in the movie, and I wonder if anyone else caught it:  On Doc Brown's grave is something to the effect of ""from Beloved Clara.""  Well Doc never met Clara UNTIL Marty traveled back to meet him.  In fact, Clara originally died in an accident which Marty and Doc saved her from.  So when Marty looks at that gravestone, it's technically impossible since he has yet to go back, save her life, and introduce her to Doc.Anyway, just wanted to point that out.  One thing that really keeps the style of the BTTF series is the common use of repetition: the scene with Marty awaking to a woman he thinks is his mother (and it usually is), being mocked for his time-inappropriate attire, running into his ancestors, and generally having to solve time-related dilemmas.  BTTF3 is a decent finish to an overall outstanding series.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
My favourite among the three,"At the end of 'Back to the Future Part II', Dr Emmett Brown (Christopher Lloyd) and Marty McFly (Michael J Fox) are ready to go back to 1985, but the time machine is struck by lightning and Doc just disappears with the DeLorean. Instantly, Marty receives a letter from the West Union, which was written by Doc seventy years ago, instructing Marty where to find the hidden time machine in order to get himself back to 1985, with the Doc in 1955's help and that the time machine must be destroyed after Marty gets back to his time, so time travel will not cause any trouble again. But soon, Marty finds a grave of Doc's and is determined to save his life. So Marty goes back to 1885 and meets his ancestors.Doc lives contently as a scientist who disguises himself as an ironmongery shop owner. And he falls in love with Clara Clayton (Mary Steenburgen), a new school teacher. He is completely besotted by her. But his death is approaching- he's to be shot dead by 'Mad Dog' Tannen (Thomas F Wilson), the ancestor of Biff Tannen (also Thomas F Wilson). Now Marty must save Doc from being murdered and meanwhile he puts his own life in danger by once again succumbing to his weakness- he simply cannot stand being called a 'coward'.After considering the pros and cons, Doc decides to go back to 1985 with Marty and he confesses the truth to Clara, but of course she doesn't believe a word he's said. Heartbroken, Doc is ready to leave with Marty. However, when Clara discovers that Doc has told her the truth, she chases him while Doc and Marty are pushing the time machine with a specially-equipped train...now Doc must choose between going back to his time, or staying with Clara...I love the Wild West scenes, the party and all that...and Doc is in love! Such wonder and magic! The ending is so sweet. This is a perfect ending of the trilogy and the final message is very positive and encouraging- the future can be changed!!! I consider this movie a very imaginative one. Watch the trilogy consecutively, and if you're a time travel fan, you won't be disappointed! 9/10",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Three Back to the Future movies, a great series 1985, 1989, 1990.","The BTTF movies, I think, should stand among the best films of all time. Not for any one facet, but for the total entertainment that it provides. Almost all of us dream of ""time travel."" BTTF certainly is not the first to explore time travel, but the way it does it is unique. Plus the fact that this is clearly a comedy, but one that is so well conceived and written that I never find myself think of it as a comedy. I've been a long time fan of Chris Lloyd's, and he is so perfect as Doc Brown. And, of course, Michael J. Fox as Marty McFly ""defines"" a role as few have been defined in films. Plus Thomas Wilson as the various Tannen characters, his great characterizations are too easily taken for granted.The Delorean time machine Doc created is the ""vehicle"" that supports three unique stories in the Trilogy. Most of the ""science"" in the 3 films is ""bad science"", which for a scientist makes it even funnier, they don't overlook any details. They always offer a ""science"" explanation for what Doc is about to do, even though it is completely nonsense.In part I, while helping Doc test the time machine in an empty mall parking lot at 2AM, Marty quite accidentally goes back to 1955, to a time where Doc had just discovered the flux capacitor and Marty's eventual parents were to get together at the big high school dance. When Lorraine, again accidentally, gets a crush on Marty he has to repair things to keep from changing his future.In Part II Marty and Doc have to travel to 2015 to keep the future kids out of trouble but a 78-yr-old Biff gets a sports almanac and steals the time machine to give it to his 18-yr-old self in 1955. The resultant gambling and wealth changed history for the worse and Marty and Doc had to use detective work and cunning to set things straight.In part III Marty gets a Western Union letter that Doc Brown had actually written in 1885 and requested delivery at the specific time in the future. Doc has ended up in 1885, is content, and insists that Marty not try to interfere. However, Marty discovers a tombstone and historical account of Doc being shot in the back over an $80 issue. So Marty has to go back and help Doc avoid that fate.To me, it isn't useful to try to judge which of the three movies is ""better"". Each one uses the main characters to create three distinctly different stories. I like to look at them as one long 3-part movie and we periodically watch all three on successive nights. The BTTF films are just great fun, and the good guys always come out on top. And there's nothing wrong with that.In 2015 I bought the 3-disk BluRay set and they really are an upgrade from the DVDs, better picture and sound. And really interesting ""extras.""",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Great end to the trilogy...with one small plot problem,I consider Back to the Future to be among the best movies ever created. However there is one question I have concerning the plot of Part III. One of the major points of the plot is that there is no gasoline in the time machine (due to a leak) and therefore they can not get it up to 88mph without the use of a train. This is the case with the time machine that Marty brought back to 1885. Is there any gas in the time machine that Doc brought back to 1885?,,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Not as good as the original two, probably the weakest of the trilogy","I was seven when I first saw this film, of course I was a fan of the first two, so I was majorly stoked. Of course, 10 years later watching it,  I feel dismayed. The third in the series, it lacked some of the charm as the other ones did. These movies to me had always been a great example of wonderful writing, really screenplay driven. But this one seemed a little contrived and while it's okay, it isn't terrific.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
"Decent, but a little disappointing end to the trilogy.","Back to the Future Part III is a decent end to the trilogy. Most of the movie takes place in the old west. The act by now, is getting a little old. Although, this sequel does possess the charm of the original, that Part II lacked somewhat, it still doesn't have the sheer energy, or explosive entertainment of Part II. This is not a bad movie, by any means. It's pretty fun (especially the train tracks finale), but it has a ""going through the motions"" type feeling at times. Overall, a decent, but a little disappointing end to the trilogy. **1/2 (out of four)",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Still as much fun as the other two!,This movie has a western setting.  Marty has to get a train up to 88 miles per hour after the time machine runs out of petrol.

"Gives the word ""dumb"" a whole new meaning.","Now, granted, I did not entirely hate this movie, unlike the family members that I viewed the film with. I thought that the whole story was way too far fetched and unrealistic and was in the end, just downright dumb. Trying to live up to the original BACK TO THE FUTURE, this film just does not do its predecessors justice. It starts out confusing, but then things start to clear up, and then they get all confusing again.There are many small elements of this film that are really just smaller plots fixed into the big one. They add to the confusion. I must say that this was really not what I was expecting.The whole western thing was okay, because the sets were very well done, and the costumes were pretty good too. The acting was cheesy as always, and of course no one dies in this film, so that just adds to the stupid ""kid movie"" feel of it all. The ending was what was most dumb of all. It makes absolutey no sense, and is basically in the movie just to confuse you even more. The writers couldn't just leave the story as it was. They couldn't have anyone die. And, they couldn't come up with a story that wouldn't confuse the s*** out of people. This third installment is purely and simply the worst of the series, but it is still something that fans of the first two films must see.BACK TO THE FUTURE PART III gets 2/5.",,Anonymous,"Comedy, Sci-Fi"
Another Disappointing Sequel to the Outstanding Original,"""Back to the Future III"" is just as disappointing as the second installment. This time Fox and Lloyd get trapped in 1885 and must try to get back to 1985.  The screenplay is not as smart as it would like to be and Zemeckis' direction is not as crisp as it should be.
