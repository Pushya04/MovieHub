Extremely Captivating Film,"I just saw this film today.  I was totally captivated... when it was all over, and the credits began to run, it took me a couple of seconds to realize where I was.  I didn't want to get out of my seat.  And once I got out of the theatre, I couldn't even talk about it for an hour or so.  I kept running the details over and over in my head.  It's rare that a film has such an impact on me.  The cinematography was stunning.  The special effects were beautifully done.  The characters' moves were effortless.  The acting was wonderful.  I really think that Michelle Yeoh should have been nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress.  I thought that the effects and storyline complimented each other brilliantly.  There were so many different layers to the plot.  There were many things that couldn't be explained with dialogue that were expressed in the characters' faces.  This film had lighthearted moments, heartwrenching moments, romantic interludes, inspirational sentiments, wonderful plot twists, superb acting, beautifully done fight scenes, never before seen special effects...it had it all.  Some scenes may have been a little over the top, but it's *fantasy*... and yet, after a few brief moments, it somehow became completely believable. That's how much this film draws you in.  This is a one of a kind film; there is just no comparing it to any other.  It transports you to another place and time.   I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I'm not sure if I'm going to see better wuxia movies,"There are two movies in the martial art fiction genre that are competing against each other for my no. 1 wuxia movie: Hero (by Yimou Zhang) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Now, tbh, the score is so tied that I'll choose the first one I saw and therefore had more time to grow inside my heart, namely Hero, BUT... that isn't to say there is one movie better than the other. If I saw this one first, it would have been my favorite.It's true that Hero succeeds this movie and I'm not sure if Zhang hasn't drawn inspiration from Ang Lee's movie but I think Hero tackles some themes that one rarely sees being explored whereas Crouching Tiger feels a bit more ''western'' in its approach, especially with that mystery subplot. That makes it a bit easier to watch and doesn't require that much patience (though I, as an Eastern European, had a hard time at the beginning distinguishing people, maybe because I'm not yet used to that Manchurian queue hairstyle).I've found the cinematography exquisite. There was one scene when Jen knelt down in water in the middle of a cave and looked up to the dark sky while the rain was washing her from her previous sins, baptizing her in the name of good. It was just splendid. Another magnificent scene happened in the pine forest but I can't describe in into words, you have to see it with your own eyes.I've already adored Ziyi Zhang from Memoirs of a Geisha but now I think I'm falling in love with her :)) . Michelle Yeoh was a well-received presence, as always. Her character brought a balance between the more romantic, juvenile world of youth where family and society hinders relationships and the more mature world of adults where you are so often your own hurdle, not allowing yourself to move further and express your true feelings.A 9,4 out of 10 from me.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Important, in a way.","What people who aren't Chinese and who don't know much about Chinese culture fail to understand, is that the warrior mythology portrayed in films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Hero has its roots in a particular genre of fiction that has been around much longer than television or film.Having grown up reading a bunch of these stories of epic fantasy, I remember being surprised when I went to watch CTHD in the theaters, and saw the audience break out in laughter at the flying stunts. I suppose the concept probably does seem ridiculous to foreigners.The whole deal with the flying is this:In the stories, the world of ""Giang Hu"" mentioned in CTHD is the unconventional part of society in which the characters that practice high transcendent martial arts exist. ""Giang Hu"" literally translates to something like ""lakes and rivers"", which kind of is a cultural allusion to the fact that most of these people wander a whole lot participating in great duels of swordsmanship and all kinds of tragic drama.One of the forms of transcendent martial arts is ""chin guon"", which translates to something like ""the art of lightness"". It's a skill that these warrior folk develop from a young age using various methods that make it so they can move as if they were light as a feather. I think the idea is that they're trained so that they progressively have less and less of a perception of their own weight, and thus they can run up walls and fly across rooftops in style.There's another type of martial art which involves transmitting ""chi"" (spiritual essence or whatever you want to call it) through your hands or fingertips and into the pressure points of others, either doing them harm, rendering them unable to move, or restoring some of their strength.If you don't understand that it's another culture's fiction/mythology and can't get over that it defies known physics and medicine etc., well, too bad.At the same time, look at acupuncture. Millions swear by the benefits of acupuncture. Hell, my father had a stroke that paralyzed half his face and went to four separate doctors. They couldn't do a damn thing. He then went to an acupuncturist and after two sessions the paralysis was gone. Conventional medicine still has no idea how acupuncture could possibly work, yet a lot of doctors will accept it as a viable option. Who the hell knows, maybe once upon a time in China people could fly.I find Chinese warrior mythology pretty interesting, and the problem is that these novels do not translate well. I'm not sure if anyone has ever tried. A lot of what goes on in them has a lot of cultural relevance and wouldn't be readily understood by certain people who have Western sensibilities. Hong Kong and Taiwan have for a couple of decades produced a lot of television shows that portray these stories, but they're mostly pretty cheesy like American soap operas.Which is why CTHD is semi-important as a film. It's the first film to expose a lot Americans to this facet of Chinese mythology, and I hope it's not the last.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
My Dream Came True,"As Ang Lee, I grew up reading wuxia novels in Taiwan. Those novels usually mixed engrossing history, thrilling action, enchanting romance. But when these novels were made into movies or TV series, none of them could match my imagination. It's either because of wrong casting, bad acting, tedious costumes, sloppy storytelling, minimal budget (so everything is shot in studio rather than in the grand Chinese landscapes as they were told in books), fake action... I could go on and on. Now Ang Lee finally made a wuxia film that captures my imagination and fulfills my dream of childhood.The casting of CTHD is perfect. No disrespect to Jet Li, but Jet Li would not make Li Mu Bai into what he should be: noble, wise but weary. Chow Yun Fat conveys the unspoken feelings of Li Mu Bai in a way I can't imagine anyone else can. But he's known for his acting, Michelle Yeoh was known for her fighting skills. Here in CTHD, she proves herself as an excellent dramatic actress. The secrete longing for Li and the confusion of Li's true feelings were clearly conveyed by her eyes. The scenes between them are heartbreaking. Zhang Zi Yi is a true discovery! What a wonderful talent to steal scenes after scenes from the veterans around her. She ran from looking innocent, haughty, feisty to loving and distraught. She made the complex Jen a real flesh and blood believable human being. Chang Chen made a perfectly sexy and charming bandit.The scenery and the photography was beyond belief. The majestic landscapes of China match my imagination when I read all the beautiful Chinese poems of the Tang and Sung dynasties. No wonder those poets could come up with those masterpieces. They sure had the best inspiration. Peter Pau not only captured the landscapes and the settings, he also managed to capture the fast-as-lightening action wonderfully. The shot of Jen gliding over water just lodged in my mind. The soundtrack is also excellent. Tan Dun used different instruments to match the different locales. He mixed in Central Asian music in the desert sequence and Chinese flute in the Southern China scenes. Yo-yo Ma's cello in the main theme makes me want to weep everytime I hear it.The storytelling was also done expertly. As a romantic-at-heart, I love the desert romance between Jen and Lo. It's one of the most charming and believable love stories that I can remember. Most people gave credit of the fighting to Yuen Wo Ping. I'd give kudos to Ang Lee. I've seen Yuen's martial art films before, but they're never done in such an imaginative and artistic way. The artistic vision has to come from Ang Lee.To sum it up, three cheers for Ang Lee! You not only fulfilled your childhood dream, you fulfilled mine too. It's such a pleasure to finally see a wuxia novel be done right. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magical Romance...,"There's a telling moment near the beginning of Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""In closeup, we see the rough-hewn, heavy wooden wheels of a peasant cart. They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.What a film this is:  a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.""Crouching Tiger..."", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia!"") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.In this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called ""wire work"" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of ""Crouching Tiger..."", Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of ""Matrix.""  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...At other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.Apart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.And, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.  In acting training we were always told you can't do that.  She does it.Chow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.The center of the film is a girl who looks to be about 15!  Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  She is remarkable. Her story is the film's binding element.  And this newcomer holds it together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas des dieux's  that frame the conflicts between characters.  She is the ""Luke Skywalker"" of the piece, if you will...though ""Crouching Tiger..."" has everything the ""Star Wars"" saga aspires to: excitement, thrills and magic. Here however, technical fireworks are wrapped heart and deeply resonant spirit. Elements Lukasfilm wanted to have, but which it succeeded in providing only in the most self-conscious way.By the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood on-screen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the ""Full Peckinpaw,"" if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully with action sequences that take the breath away and inspire a sense of awe, rather than simply leave you white-knuckled and sweaty.There are those who will grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and tricks.  True enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile emotional burdens!I won't be able to wait for the DVD, and will probably see it again, perhaps see it twice before it hits the home-market.My recommendation: Just go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beware of cheap imitations,"Crouching Tiger is Ang Lee's take on the Wu Xia tradition of film making. Wu Xia, for those not familiar with the style, evolved out of popular Chinese fiction. It contains formulaic elements such as honourable warriors, powerful swordswomen, powerful swords, and often magic and mythical beasts. Possibly, it has a parallel with sword and sorcery pulp literature  and even Western romances.Although he grew up in Taiwan, not Hong Kong or China, Ang Lee has said he has always wanted to make a Wu Xia film. When he did, he brought sophistication and strong production values which, while not uncommon in mainstream Chinese cinema, was less common in the martial arts or Wu Xia traditions.Make no mistake; Crouching Tiger is a beautiful, beautiful movie. The colours are rich, the light dances and the movements are balletic. But unlike lesser imitations, such as Hero, it is much more than that just stylish production and mesmerising action.Most films (Western or Eastern) have a rigid plot against which characters move. At worst the characters become ciphers; they advance the story by making choices regardless of whether these choices are in keeping with their character. Crouching Tiger, like the best of cinema, has dynamic characters whose internal struggles advance the plot. The dog wags the tail, not the other way around.At the heart of Crouching Tiger is the relationship between Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh). Mu Bai is looking for a way out of the Gang Ho (Warrior) lifestyle  he joins a monastery, as a route to enlightenment and peace, but cannot cast aside his unrequited love for Shu Lien (another warrior). On the brink of declaring their love for one another, Mu Bai's Green Destiny Sword is stolen, and his arch enemy returns. He must temporarily put aside his feelings to recover the sword and bring his master's killer to justice Seeming to take a fair chunk from his previously directorial role, Sense and Sensibility, Ang Lee weaves a story which tragically juxtaposes the loving and giving but repressed relationship of Mu Bai and Shu Lien, with the fiery, wilful and destructive passions of Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi) and Lo (Chang Chen). The result, for me, was breathtaking.Some critics have suggested that the characterisation is quite slight. I think this just demonstrates the high standard to which they were prepared to judge this film. Ang Lee perfectly marries action/adventure with drama. The results may not please purists from either camp, but for the rest of the audience it is pure magic.In many ways, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is pure Wu Xia. But it has also re-invented the genre and given it artistic credibility. The greatest joy of the film is watching great Hong Kong stars like Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh being given characters with depth  and watching them fill the screen with their performances. The film also benefits from great performances from Zhang Ziyi and a very under-rated Chang Chen.Quite simply, Crouching Tiger has everything. It is beautiful, breathtaking and deeply moving. 9½ /10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A wondrous mythology, a cinematic masterpiece.","I gave a wry chuckle when the opening credits pronounced Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon a Sony Cinema Classic in the year of its release. However, I too would not have hesitated to brand this film such. It is a cinematic masterpiece that left me in silent reverie at its conclusion.The film's story unfolds amidst the ancient temples, bamboo forests and painted deserts of nineteenth century China: a sensual, mystical landscape that, at our first high-angle glimpse of Peking takes on a dizzying scale. This world is inhabited by the Wudan, spectral warriors from legend who effortlessly leap between rooftop and bamboo tree, a device which elevates them to a plane divorced from our parochial middle-class values without the loss of their intense humanity. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is an ode to the human spirit that transcends genre; it is at once fantasy, romance, historical epic and thriller, enriched by a subtle humour.At the film's heart are four compelling performances. Ziyi Zhang, is enchanting as the wilful Jen Yu, daughter of a government official, who aspires to the code of the Wudan. Her destiny is entwined with those of Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), disciples of this enigmatic clan, and of the desert bandit Lo (Chen Chang) by the theft of an arcane sword, Mu Bai's quest for revenge and the fulfilment of a powerful yet unrequited loveChow Yun Fat possesses an hypnotic screen presence in his portrayal of this regal master, who displays an unparalleled heroism untainted by western cliché as the film travels inexorably toward his shuddering death-blow. This resonates long after the credit sequence has run and you've marvelled at how few stunt artists were engaged to actualize the film's thrillingly beautiful fight sequences. These are not the idle distractions aimed at a boyish mind we find in other martial arts films but rather a transcendent form of dance. Their exquisitely honed choreography rivals that of Graham Murphy and Twyla Tharp.Star of these sequences is the four hundred year old Green Destiny sword that exerts a powerful metaphoric presence on the film. It is a sensuous artefact that sings when struck, punctuating Yo-Yo Ma's haunting cello solos, a feature of the immersive soundtrack.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a film of titanic proportions, with all the pageantry of Kundun, minus the ponderous pace, and without a trace of the cloying sentimentalism which infected Titanic's impoverished narrative. Li Mu Bai's final words are a more fervent declaration of truth than any to have graced the screen before.After all that, I can offer no further commendation except to say that this is the latest greatest film of my now seemingly hollow existence.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good but perhaps a little overrated,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a good and fun watch, but I can't help but feel it was missing a few elements to make it as epic as I was expecting.It is practically faultless in terms of its beauty. From the cinematography of the Chinese landscapes, the gentle and calming score, to the flowing and rhythmic martial arts, it is a joy from that perspective.The performances were all very good, and the characters interesting. However I felt like the plot was somewhat lacking. It didn't fully draw me in and was definitely the weakest part of the film. It ebbed and flowed in terms of its quality and perhaps lacked a bit of focus in some parts.Despite all this, I did enjoy watching this film. It has some incredible action scenes and is full of beauty and wonder. Definitely a worthwhile watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The ultimate battle between sense and silliness,"I always have time for films that dare to be different and that faith was stretched to the limits with CTHD. The story is set in feudal China and centres around an ancient (even then!) sword that is stolen by person(s) unknown.Real star of the show is Ziyi Zhang who comes across as a kind of young female Bruce Lee, although somewhat aided by the ability to defy gravity - director Ang's claims that she could not fly, but perform great leaps and falls!(Sorry Lee - I know flying when I see it!)The film starts with a murky and talky set-up that introduce us to the three principle characters played by Chow Yun Fat,   Ziyi Zhang and Michelle Yeoh. From their talk-talk it seems they have all acquired mystical living and fighting skills although I would not be like to explain the full in-and-outs of it!Thankfully the silly talking stops and  movie starts to kick-off in earnest when  Zhang is kidnapped on the way to her marriage of convenience. This is where the film really works (as an action movie) and indeed some of the set pieces are classics, although aided and abetted by skilful fly-by-wire work.I don't understand is why the script wasn't re-written to make the characters background  clearer, their skills highlighted (is Zhang hitting with normal powers for someone of her height/weight or superhuman powers?) and then get the whole show on the road earlier. Maybe I missed a few things while dozing through the slow opening, but I could have done with a bit more help with what follows.The actors all put in solid performances, although only the doll-faced Zhang climbs above the script. Fat seems to be billed as star of the show - perhaps because he is the only recognised actor - but he features only in passing. Equally curious is that his love for stunt-happy Yeoh seems understated, but perhaps that is the Oriental way?Plenty of plus points for having strong females characters that hold their own in all aspects of life, but the mystical soup doesn't deliver anything like the classic  some people think they are seeing. The real battle in this movie fights isn't between good and evil, it is between sense and silliness. Sense wins wins in the end, but it is a close call...",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Breathtakingly Beautiful...,"As a film student living in Toronto, I look forward to the Toronto International Film Festival every year.  Last year, the highlight of the festival for me was American Beauty.  This year, it would have to be (so far) Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".Being of Asian descent, I've seen my share of wu xia genre movies to last me a life time.  However, most of them are so centred on the fighting, that they forget the rest of the elements that are involed.  The movie turns into one long scripted fighting scene with maybe a slight hint of story. Crouching Tiger, on the other hand realizes these issues, and builds these oh-so entertaining action sequences into an epic with typical asian themes such as true love and honour.Being an epic, one would expect the usual long takes and establishing shots, and boy does it ever look beautiful.  Traversing through a myriad of regions spanning the lengh of China (from the deserts to bamboo forests, to mountains high in the clouds), the film soley based on its asthetic properties is nothing short of stunning.  The lighting of different landscapes and the exquisitly designed costumes all radiate with stunning colour.  And then there's the cinemetography.  Wow!  The backdrops, establishing shots look absolutely marvelous.  If your jaw dropped when you saw Rome and its coliseum in Gladiator, wait until you see ancient Beijing recreated on the screen!Okay, so it's a good looking movie.  What about the story?  The complexity of the plot is rather sparse, probably reminiscent of epics such as Braveheart or Gladiator, which is by no means a bad thing.  Although both Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeo did have major parts, this movie belongs mostly to Zhang Ziyi who IMHO did an amazing job playing a very complex role (one which required her to represent nobily as a princess, naivness, as well as show inner strength).  Mainly concentrating on her unwillingness to give in to the ideals of an arranged marriage, the decently written script adds a story of an old warrior trying to retire and a 300+ year old sword.All in all, this film blends story, well choreographed action, and a stylistic eye to create a mythilogical piece that not only represents the wu xia genre justly by doing it well, but also contributes to raising the quality of filmmaking usually applied in the making of a similar type of film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
as beautiful as it is boring,"I´ve watched this four or five times, well, I tried, because I´ve fallen asleep every single one of them, seriously. I am able to sit through movies like THE LAST EMPEROR ot THE WEEPING MEADOW and I´m kind of a stubborn film goer, usually forcing myself to endure any kind of film, no matter how long, slow or bad. Also, I liked other works by Ang Lee, specially EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN. I came to the obvious conclusion there must be something utterly boring about this film that makes me not give a rat´s ass about any character or any of their affected dialogues. I´m guessing the fighting scenes are so gorgeous and unique this film has stayed in our colective subconscious as way more than it really is.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Vivid Dream And An Action Fantasy,"Less than half an hour into the viewing of this masterpiece I knew this would become one of my favorite films - of all time. Only in my wildest dreams (quite literally, this movie has touched me on a personal level) have I visualized such fantastic and precise choreography, so captivating that to take your eyes away during the intense confrontations is to deny yourself the essence of what makes this film so wonderful.With an artistic license unprecedented, the action scenes are entirely unbelievable but purely the work of a fabulous imagination.

A martial arts movie filmed with great visual brio,"Chinese martial arts films had found a market in the West during the Kung Fu boom initiated by Bruce Lee in the early 1970s But ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" represents a new departure, an attempt to produce a sophisticated, big-budget Chinese film that would appeal both to mainstream Western audiences and to audiences in the Far East Through their quest to find the stolen sword of Green Destiny, warriors Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) and Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) explore themes of love, loyalty and sacrificeAng Lee was an astute choice as director The location shooting was on the Chinese mainland and the actors came from Malaysia, Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as China Instead of the Shaolin school of martial arts favored by Bruce Lee, Ang Lee opted for the more spiritual form of Wudan; brute force is replace by scenes of balletic grace as opponents climb up walls or flit through tree-topsThe widespread success of the film is a firm indication that Chinese culture is making its mark",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The most beautiful film ever made.,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, quite simply, a stunning film and a real breath of fresh air in a genre that was previously somewhat stagnant. Kung-fu films were on a very steady decline, with only Jet Li making a valid effort to change things around. It comes then as a great relief that Ang Lee decided to do what he did and put an entirely new slant on the genre.Tacky dubbed dialogue is out of the window and we're back to the films original Chinese language subtitled into English. This adds a lot more to one of the films main themes, culture. While we as the Kung-fu loving public have grown used to storylines generally involving the hero's lost mother/brother/pet goldfish, Crouching Tiger... eschews all of these stereotypes and sets about creating a really authentic atmosphere.I won't bother rehashing the story because if you haven't seen the film yet I want you to go in with as little knowledge as possible. If you don't know what to expect, I can't recommend Crouching Tiger... more highly. Lee's directorial style is simply a joy to behold, and every minute detail is treated with a respect most directors simply don't have. Now, the part we've all been waiting for. I know what you're thinking, ""It's all very well having a great story but what good is it if they're all going to mince about like fairies?""Well, I'm pleased to tell you that these guys kick more ass than you've EVER seen before. The fight sequences are stunningly choreographed and the 'flying' looks spectacular. While a big thing has been made of Chow Yun Fat and Zhang Ziyi's treetop battle, the one for me is between Michelle Yeoh's Shu Lien and Ziyi's Jen. Both instances, both in the courtyard and the dojo are, quite frankly, the most astounding displays of martial arts I have EVER been lucky enough to witness. While Bruce Lee can certainly do the real thing, and he is without doubt the original and best, Wo Ping's sequencing of the fight scenes is truly revolutionary.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of the best films I have ever seen and I would recommend anyone, whether or not they are interested in Kung-fu movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Truly Exceptional,"The show was fantastic. It is one of the best, if not the best Chinese swashbuckling show. With that simple and to the point assertion let me continue with my review.The kungfu choreography was marvelous and beautiful. With Yuen Wo Ping as the martial arts director, things can hardly get better. I dare say that the kungfu movement in this show was definitely more varied and graceful than his other works, for example, the Matrix which obtained such raving reviews. Even when compared to his other Mandarin titles, like Last Hero in China, this show stands out. In other movies, you get the feeling they're merely fighting it out, but for this one, there is a genuine fluidity. The aesthetic and artistic direction is definitely top-notch. Although there were times things were a little overdone, that will not compromise the overall quality of the show.The acting was excellent as well. Chow Yun Fatt and Michelle Yeoh were fine as the constipated middle-aged `we're a little old but we still love each other' couple. The scene at the end was absolutely heart breaking; so subtle and yet absolute racking. As for Zhang Ziyi, she was perfect as the slightly brat-ish aristocratic daughter of a governor, who's yet to find what she really wants in life. From blithe to confusion to angst to despondence and then despair, there is a character journey which she succeeds in portraying. And all this while, yes, she somehow manages to stay likeable. Its pretty amazing if you consider she's still in acting school.This must be one of the better adaptation of Chinese `Giang Hu' Novels. Usually, they're so badly adapted they result in one hodgepodge mess of a conglomerated movie. This one has an exceptional script which is easy to follow and not merely as inane as having only good versus evil. Here, our protagonists have their own personal battles to overcome and their own personal devils to defeat. And if any of these sound boring, it isn't! It's one of the fastest 2.5 hr movie I've watched. The ending is also one of the classiest and most beautiful I've seen.This show is cinematic poetry. The music score compliments the Kungfu sequences well; the lyrical dialogues emerge charmingly.  Everything fits in so darn perfectly. You have to concede to the fact that Ang Lee is undoubtedly a visionary and amazing director.Even if you don't give a damn about any of the above, this show is a visual treat. Go watch the show for the scenery, the martial arts, the actors. The bottom line is to go and watch it because you will rarely find a better one. 9/10.Yes yes, i'm a groupie and if u watch it, i think u'll become one. :DD",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
2000: Year Of The Cat Fight,"""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is one of two Ang Lee movies I've seen. One, ""The Ice Storm,"" takes place a couple of towns up the parkway from where I live. This one is set half a world away, yet watching it makes China feel closer than New Canaan. I have a feeling a lot of people get a similar sensation.Master Li Mu Bai (Yun-Fat Chow) is tired of kicking butt; he only wants peace, and perhaps a new start in life with the woman he loves but keeps a wary, correct distance from, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh). Matters are complicated with the theft of a great sword, the Green Destiny. Lien's investigation quickly centers on a bored rich girl named Jen (Zihi Zhang), who hides her skills under embroidered gowns but is ultimately as much about rebellion as Lien is about conformity. When the two women square off, sparks will fly, literally. Yet Jen has goodness in her. Can Bai and Lien save her from becoming ""a poison dragon"" in the service of her murderous master, the Jade Fox?I never really got into martial-arts movies, probably because of the culture gap but also because until recently they didn't get much respect from critics, at least here in the West. That was already beginning to change by 2000, but ""Crouching Tiger"" was the clear tipping point, Oscar-nominated for Best Picture and praised to the skies for its beautiful cinematography and gravity-defying fight scenes.Those fight scenes are amazing, each in a different way. One resembles a dazzling lyrical ballet on a lush bamboo forest; another is a grand goofy bar fight which is played for laughs. The best fight is between Jen and Lien, a cinematic centerpiece every bit as great as Rick and Ilsa's last scene on the tarmac in ""Casablanca."" No doubt it got PC points among Western critics for featuring two women in battle, it also is a nice way of bringing out the central tension in the film's deceptively simple narrative, which is that between cultural obligation as embodied by Lien, and individual happiness as sought by Jen.Earlier in the film, Jen lays her cards out on the table for Lien, with whom she hopes to be friends: ""I'm getting married, but I'm not happy about it,"" Jen says. Lien's wooden reply: ""I've heard. Congratulations."" Much later on, after Jen has run out on her wedding and stolen the Green Destiny, Bai talks about taking Jen as his student, to save her from being corrupted by evil. ""What if her husband objects?"" asks Lien. Bai gives her a look which says it all: What planet did you beam down from? She's Patty Hearst now, and about to become Darth Vader. Her husband's wishes are the least of our concerns.Not to Lien. While oddly liberated by her single status (which in turn is due to her self-restrictive attitude about being in mourning for a long-dead fiancé), Lien is the cultural touchstone, or rather millstone, of this drama. She and Bai are clearly meant for each other, but she resists. Oddly, while this puts her at loggerheads with audience expectations, Lien is also the movie's most empathetic character, more so than the remote Bai or spoiled Jen. As played by Yeoh, Lien offers us a passionate center who both embodies the code she and Bai live by, and betrays that code's limitations.Getting all that on screen is a great triumph for Yeoh, and one I needed to watch the film more than once to pick up on. She's so remarkable in her fight scenes and running up and down walls (yes, I know wires were involved, but even so the athletic skill necessary to sell such action is impossible to imagine) people miss the consummate acting of her performance, the aware inertness of her eyes, the expression of sad longing that she allows to poke through her bland facade. Chow is great, too, and Zhang beyond that in a star-making performance of beauty and rage, yet I wouldn't feel the warmth I do for this film without Yeoh inhabiting so much of it, not just body but soul.The DVD which I found for under $10 has not only both the dubbed and subtitled versions of the films (which are radically different, and both worth viewing as they bring out different aspects of this deep film) but a funny commentary track by director Lee and co-writer James Schamus, which is remarkable in and of itself for its tone. You'd think they were Joel and Crow having at a Roger Corman flick on ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" for all the potshots they take at their masterpiece. I guess you can be humble when you make a film as good as this, easily the best film of 2000 and a cinematic milestone that will inspire generations yet unborn, whatever future film technologies dish out.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not As Good As Is Made Out Down To One Reason,"I finally got around to seeing CROUCHING TIGER , HIDDEN DRAGON at the weekend . It`s a movie of almost legendary status but I was slightly disappointed with it for one reason that I`ll come to shortly . First of all may I just point out that there`s a lot of acclaim that is justified , it`s a beautifully made film down to its technical areas like the cinematography ( Check out the final stunning scene ) the editing , the soundtrack and the choregraphy . It also has a sense of humour best summed up in the scene at the tea house but this scene - Indeed the whole movie - is let down by something and that something is this : It`s obvious the fleet footed characters are being pulled up and down on a harness . No matter how much the production team try to disguise it it`s obvious this is how the technique is achieved and spoiled the film for me greatlyAm I cruel cynic ? Well maybe but think about this : Would LORD OF THE RINGS have been such a sucess if it was painfully obvious that Gollum was a CGI character ? Never once did I believe Gollum was anything less than a real character . Even to this day I have visions that Gollum now sits at home anxiously waiting for Peter Jackson to ring him to tell him he`s starring in THE HOBBIT , that`s how convincing he was to me , but CROUCHING TIGER , HIDDEN DRAGON fails because as soon as I saw characters running over roof tops and along tree branches I realised I was watching people on wires . A great pity because there is so much to admire in this film",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great movie that changed my view...,"on how I view other movies. This movie was so fresh and exciting that it made me look at the Asian cinema scene a little closer. The story alone is great. It is simple and very different from what I am used to here in the States. Visually it was one of the best movies I have ever scene. From the effects matching the tone of the movie, to the locations and the colors used in those locales. The fight scenes were very cool. I love good fight scenes and I love swords. This movie pulls off both very nicely. Since I have watched this movie, I have watched many other Asian films and I find them refreshing. The movies are more story driven with a heavy emphasis on tones. I might watch this movie this weekend now that I am thinking of it. Really cool movie especially on a rainy night.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Beautiful cinematography, great fights--little else","What's all the fuss about? This movie is a Japanese romantic drama about male and female roles and a special sword and tons of other stuff. The story is so convoluted, I can't really recount it all. Basically, the film has, as I said, incredible fight scenes and beautiful wide-screen cinematography, but little else. The story is confusing and boring and, with the sole exception of Michelle Yeoh, badly acted (even Chow Yun-Fat!). I gave up on the film about halfway through when they threw in a needlessly long flashback that's a Western!!!! It adds very little to the story. It seems to be there just to up the romance in the movie. Also with such bad acting, you could care less about the characters. Also, the fight scenes aren't that original...Jackie Chan has been doing them in his movies since the 1970s. Also, the film is subtitled...it doesn't bother me but other viewers might not like it. So an overpraised Japanese film. In a few years, nobody will remember this.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Still my favourite wuxia film after all these years,"When one thinks of wuxia films, usually the first thing that comes to mind are the fantastic fight scenes. Crouching Tiger is no exception, featuring top notch fight choreography. What really stands out is the variety offered, from a heart pumping night chase flying across rooftops, to a quiet, mesmerizing duel of wills atop the bamboo forest.The soundtrack is one of the best that I've ever heard. Whether it's traditional drum beats that amplify each punch and kick, or the sweeping, melancholic beauty of Yo-Yo Ma's cello, all of the music composed by Tan Dun fits each scene perfectly. There are some pieces that still bring a tear to my eye when I hear it.But what really sets this film apart, is having Ang Lee, one of the best character directors of our time, inject his brand of sensitivity and romance into the wuxia genre. This is a tale of two love stories, of people caught between tradition and freedom, as well as the struggle between enlightenment and holding onto one's earthly connections. I love that there are so many strong wuxia heroines in this film, and there's a specific scene involving a teacup that was just masterful in showing their battle of wits and skill.This movie really feels like a blend of East and West in terms of content, sentiment, and filming technique. If you are new to the genre, I highly recommend this one as your starting point. Since Ang Lee is a Taiwanese director, there are also no Chinese censorship or weird political talking points, and I was absorbed in the story from beginning to end.Really can't say enough to praise this film. The actors are wonderful, the music is excellent, the plot is engaging, the cinematography is beautiful, the fight scenes are exhilarating, and the ending of both love stories moved me deeply. If you haven't seen Ang Lee's masterpiece of a wuxia film yet, I highly recommend it!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Overrated,"Being that I had seen many films from Hong Kong, my basic feeling is that this movie was overrated.  Yes, I expected some action with drama, which the movie did give, but the plot of the movie (spoiled rich princess wants to be #1) didn't captivate me.First the good.  Yes, the cinematography was beautiful, giving one glimpses of China never seen.  Second, Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat were great.  I was especially surprised to see Chow do so well for an actor known as a gun toting hero.  The fight scenes were, for the most part, well choreographed, especially the scene with Michelle and Ying Zhang.So why overrated?  First of all, there were many kung-fu movies with similar or even better fight scenes.  Second, I just couldn't buy the ""flying leaps"" seen here, especially for a film trying to be dramatic; how do they get the magic to do it?  Third, the character of the princess just annoyed me.  I think it would have been better to focus more on the characters of Michelle and Chow than on what seemed to be a spoiled brat.  Finally, I try to get the main gist of the film, but it just doesn't come to me.Quite frankly, if Ang Lee's name wasn't on this film, I doubt it would have gotten the recognition it got.  Yes, I know that's how the world turns, but a director's name can't influence how you see a film; it should be able to stand on its own.  For me, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is slightly above average, but not worthy of the recognition it got.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absurd!,"With the amount over-zealous hype surrounding this film, one would expect something of grand design. Sadly, that's all it is, over-zealous hype. Possibly the most over-hyped film since Star Wars: Phantom Menace. As I sat in the theatre watching this I couldn't help but laugh heartily at the defying gravity antics that only made me want to start singing, ""Spiderman, Spiderman, does whatever a spider can."" Yes, it is that bad. Two women sitting in front of me kept shooting dirty looks my way, but really how could anyone take this absurd movie seriously? In fact, Jade Fox (the film's remorseless ""bad guy"")merely alters the hairdo and for some strange reason no one recognizes him. I suppose everyone is blind, and dumb. And that's what this movie is, dumb.First, the acting is on par with every other absurd ""action,"" gravity defying kung-fu film. Nothing special, period. The script is littered with the most inane dialogue, again like most films of this type. Really, had it been dubbed the pathetic reality of that would be more noticed. The story is, again, on par with every other film in this genre... tinged with a little spaghetti western thrown in for good measure. So, in reality there is nothing special about this film. Nothing!Ok, so perhaps some people will find the gravity-defying antics some sort of brainless entertainment for two hours. I didn't. The action scenes are well choreographed, but when they begin to toss their hands in the air and take off like Superman, crawl around on bamboo tree tops like somekind of monkey, crawl up walls and skip across roofs you just can NOT take it seriously. It's just comical to the extreme. And really, it is so very obvious that these people are on wires, you can practically see them (and in a few scenes, if you pay close attention, you can).This film is too absurd to be any good, too serious to be campy or fun and just doesn't work at all. With the boxoffice booming on this, I can only imagine a select few people are seeing it over and over and over, and in the process tricking their friends into seeing it too. I rarely feel as though I wasted my money when I go see a film, but I DID in fact waste my money when I saw this turkey.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hulk Smash!,"Fans burnt by George Lucas' ""Phantom Menace"" found solace in Ang Lee's cosily straightforward ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"". The film was greeted with a shrug in China (it was a flop), a country desensitised to wuxia tales, but Westerners loved it. Probably because ""Tiger"" is basically ""Star Wars"", with its own assortment of bounty-hunters, Jedis, Sith Lords, princesses, rogues, warriors, villains, henchmen, Yodas, fairy tale romances, teachers, masters, apprentices, chosen ones and much vague talk of destiny, fate and ""light"" and ""dark"" sides. When he's not indulging in super choreographed action sequences, Lee's aesthetic is also very Lucasy, which is to say, very John Ford, very David Lean, very Kurosawa, with clean lines, big open spaces, and simple but careful shot selection. What's strange is the film's budget. The film looks like it has the budget of one of those big, state backed Chinese or Stalinist productions, but ""Crouching"" was made for about fifteen million dollars. Lee gets a lot of mileage out of his budget.Martial arts fans abhor ""Tiger"". It's too geared to western tastes, too watered down, and China's been churning out similar wuxia for decades. Why should this one get all the credit? But Lee does put his own spin on the material. His film is more sensual, poetic, graceful, romantic, has a mysterious beauty, and is more delicate than is typical of the genre. His female characters are also given a bigger role than is customary and his action at times seems more like expressive dance.Repression, restrictions, strict moral codes and self-control are an obsession with Lee. With ""Hulk"" we had a scientist who struggles to curb his anger, his ""Taking Woodstock"", ""Wedding Banquet"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" revolved around characters repressing their homosexuality, while ""Sense and Sensibility"", ""Lust Caution"", ""Ice Storm"" and ""Woodstock"" again all hinged on either repression, free expression or the inhibiting of desire. In ""Crouching's"" case – the title itself refers to ""one who has hidden, suppressed talents"" - we have a stifled three-way love between characters called Mu Bai, Shu Lien and Jen Yu, all of whom are prohibited from desire by strict moral/social codes, feudal customs and warrior traditions.The rejection of these codes is perhaps why the film was shunned by China (and is so popular with western women). Chinese mythology, Taoist philosophy and the hokey ""mysticism"" of Asian martian arts films (akin to ""Star Wars'"" ""The Force""), all stress an esoteric mode of detachment, a form of denial characteristic of Eastern thought in which the world is seen to be illusory and detached cogitation is seen to be the path to enlightenment. Lee, in contrast, is trading in a more genteel, Western sensibility; a kind of romantic humanism where one is called to ditch Eastern stoicism and embrace the ""reality"" and ""meaning"" of human attachments in this life. This tug-of-war is epitomised by a trio of conversations located in each of the film's three acts. In the first, characters called Mu Bai and Shu Lien, who we learn have long had feelings for each another but have denied these feelings to pursue the demands of a Wudan warrior lifestyle, discuss the fact that Mu Bai, when meditating, reaches not ""the bliss of enlightenment"" but ""a place of endless sorrow"". For Mu Bai, passions cannot be extinguished and only serve to increase the pull of desire. Mu Bai's conflict – the way clinging to personal affection is contrary to his Wudan ways of detachment – can be found even in Lucas' ""Star Wars"" prequels, only there Lucas has some monastic ninja kid literally moan about the way his calling prevents him from losing his virginity (""Me want make sexy time but Yoda say no! Wah Wah Wah!"").The second conversation occurs at the film's midpoint, when Mu Bai and Shu Lien finally touch. ""Shu Lien,"" he recoils, ""the things we touch have no permanence. My master would say there is nothing we can hold onto in this world. Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real."" Shu Lien then brushes aside his Taoism with direct, naive realism: ""Not everything is an illusion. My hand is real.""It's in the third conversation that the film breaks away from your typical martial arts movie mysticism and repudiates Wudan philosophy. Here, Mu Bai is dying and Shu Lien urges him to meditate: ""Free yourself of this world. Let your soul rise to eternity. Do not waste your breath on me."" ""I have already wasted my life,"" Mu Bai responds. ""I would rather be a ghost drifting by your side, as a condemned soul, than enter heaven without you."" Contrast this with the countless marital arts movies, or even the ""Star Wars"" franchise, which end with the ghostly spirits of dead warriors, monks and masters hovering contently over the living. Mu Bai is given no supernatural reprieve, no higher plane of existence. He just dies. The film then ends with the recounting of a mountain legend in which a young woman must paradoxically ""float away and never return"" if she wishes to ""return"". The whole film hinges on a similar paradox: acting on a desire one desires not to have. It's the paradox of Buddhism: continually desiring to eliminate desire, whereby satiating desire is impossible and it is ultimately desire which blocks the road to desirelessness. This is contrasted with a more Western hedonism, where the hedonist attempts the cessation of desire by ""giving in"" to them all.Beyond all this, the film resembles the works of King Hu, Ozu and Ichikawa, the latter two only insofar as it contrasts straitjacketed older generations, and their societal obligations, with oppositional, younger generations. The film's ending suggests that a character called Jen sacrifices her life/love so that Mu Bai and Shu Lien may finally be together.8.5/10 – Worth two viewings.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Criminally under-viewed.,"Click on my name o see my many movies lists.With how horrible movies have become, and it's the fault of my fellow Gen-Xers, it is sad that this movie has under 300k views.

Simply breathtaking!,"I was absolutely mesmerised by Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Everything about it is breathtaking, it is nothing short of a poetic, visually gorgeous martial arts masterpiece. As much as I did love Brokeback Mountain, I think this is Ang Lee's best film. Speaking of Lee, he is a fine director, and does a superb job with his direction on this film. The story is easy to follow, but there is also a certain complexity to it as it explores the perennial themes of love, loyalty, duty and sacrifice, while the script is wonderfully poetic and the pace rarely lags.The characters are also hugely credible. They could have been clichéd easily, but actually they have surprisingly so much depth to them and at the end you admire them. The visuals, music, stunt work and acting are what really impress though. The film looks gorgeous, all Ang Lee's films look beautiful but this gets my vote as his most visually stunning. The cinematography is beautiful, and the scenery and costumes are exquisite. The stunt work is brilliantly choreographed and the special effects actually enhance rather than distract. The music is just gorgeous, there were a few scenes where I was reduced to tears. And there are many memorable scenes especially the jaw-dropping rooftop pursuit and tree top battle. As for the acting, Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh both excel, and I was surprised in a very good way by Zhang Ziyi who is electrifying as the teenage thief.In conclusion, this is a breathtaking film and a must see for anyone who loves martial arts or visually stunning movies especially. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not Ang Lee's best.,"Please, don't get me wrong.  I love Ang Lee.  I have not yet seen a film from Lee that I didn't like, and this is no exception.  Still, I don't find this the best of those I've seen by far.Chalk it up to cultural distance if you like, but this film seemed a bit trite to me.  The archetypes seemed too basic.I love Chinese action films, and this wasn't one.  This was a drawn out love story with a subtext of action.  The uninitiated might believe that this represents Chinese Action well.  To them, I'd reccomend the John Wu film, ""Hard Boiled.""Meanwhile, the character story was too drawn out.  The singular jump to the past was confusing because of its length combined with its singularity.If I had to guess, I'd say this is a classical Chinese story set to film. This is China's ""Braveheart.""  Therefor, without the cultural investment, we are left somewhat dry.All this said, the film is universally enjoyable.  What it lacks in action, it makes up in emotion, and vice versa.  It's an emminently watchable film. It's just not a classic.  At least not to my ignorant American eyes.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is a very well executed movie that is the definition of art,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched again on Tubi. The storyline follows an orphaned young lady who is taken in and trained by an uneducated witch. She matures into a thief and steals the sword of a trusting martial artist master. As she flees she runs into a love interest that only muddles her motives.This movie is directed by Ang Lee (Lust, Caution) and stars Chow Yun-Fat (Replacement Killers), Ziyi Zhang (Memoirs of a Geisha), Michelle Yeoh (Tomorrow Never Dies), Chang Chen (Happy Together), Pei-Pei Cheng (Mulan) and Sihung Lung (The Wedding Banquet).The storyline for this is very intricate and complex with very well developed characters and various sub plots within the primary storyline. The cinematography is absolutely stunning and the martial arts scenes are fun despite the overuse of wires. Every fight scene with Yeoh and Zhang is absolutely amazing and Jade Fox was a tremendous character. The dialogue was very written and the storyline is well paced and unfolds perfectly.

"1/1/00 7/10 Good, but not that good.","Critically acclaimed, with most pros falling over themselves to praise this thing, this movie just isn't all that spectacular. Chow Yun-Fat is underused, although it's nice to see Michelle Yeoh so much. Zhang Ziyi is amazingly pretty, matched nicely with the appropriately hunky Chang Chen, and hey she can swing a sword.The wire work doesn't work for me at all. I much prefer Jackie Chan jumping through a ladder, i.e. stunt work, to this magical floating up walls business, i.e. special effects. The set piece up in the bamboo trees didn't move me one bit.Narratively, this thing is all over the map. There's a complicated plot, too daft to recount, that's supposedly intentionally silly, but it's silly just the same. There's tiresome flashback which still fails to explain why Jen Yu is so annoyingly selfish; she remains unredeemed by her attempt at redemption at the end.Sir Te sums it all up when the Green Destiny is stolen for the second (and feels like nineteenth) time.

"Flying People, Disappointing Film","I was very impressed with Ang Lee's 1997 film, The Ice Storm, but I'd been avoiding Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon since I first saw previews for it weeks before it opened. Then, because of unexpected circumstances and a slightly aroused curiosity, I recently found myself in line for a ticket with a couple of friends. As I predicted, in spite of some accolades from various critics and others, the film just didn't work for me. One of the things that bugs me about this movie is the fact that it utilizes very natural, realistic settings, characters and events with two glaring exceptions: people flying through the air and a lack of displayed passion between two of the main characters. As far as the flying thing is concerned, the film just isn't whimsical or fantastic enough to have characters breaking into Peter Pan gymnastics at the drop of a hat. Here is a very real and beautiful environment with people leading essentially believable lives punctuated with kung fu histrionics; yet every once in a while they fly around. Granted, the flying sequences are stupendously handled and somewhat fascinating, but they're just a bit too over-the-top for the overall tone of the material. Another important aspect of the film that deflates its potential impact is the alleged passion between two of the main characters. Action man Yun-Fat Chow plays Li Mu Bai, a warrior ready to retire his prized sword. His love interest is an equally agile Yu Shu Lien, played by Michelle Yeoh. Supposedly they love each other and always have. You know the drill...one of those long-standing, unrealized love affairs that seethes under the surface for decades. Yet their mutual chemistry and passion is not obvious enough to be engaging or captivating to the viewer. It's not until the very end that we finally get a strong sense of their mutual love. Perhaps it's better late than never, but in this case, one isn't quite sure. As much as anything, their late burst of passion almost underscores how much more they could have displayed in previous scenes. Complicating matters, it appears this tendency is caused by a combination of factors: the material, the actors' abilities, the direction and possibly even differences in perception from a cultural (East/West) standpoint. Another debilitating element of the film stems from a somewhat convoluted plot. Li Mu Bai's decision to retire his sword is an important step in his character's development. Especially important is the location of his sword's resting place, or in other words, who has  possession or control of it. The problem with this premise is that the sword floats around quite a bit. One minute it's in one person's hands and the next minute it seems to belong to someone else. An important character in the film is Jen Yu, played by the small but mighty Ziyi Zhang. As a troublesome young aristocrat engaged to be married, her motivations are foggy or confusing at times. She seems to flip-flop from demure and sweet to deadly and nefarious, then back again. Even the man she eventually seems to fall in love with is subjected to her schizophrenic mood changes. As with most contemporary films, the cinematography is stunning, enhanced even more by the beautiful backdrop of China. In fact, someone said China is the real star of this film, and I'm tempted to agree. To be honest, I wanted to like Crouching Tiger a lot more than I did, and I admit I'm unfamiliar with Chinese mythology and literary works.It could be that in its translation and because of cultural differences, it's the kind of film with a potentially uneven appeal and impact-level.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the greatest movies of the last 25 years,"This film is a dramatic and poetic expression of a philosophy of life and contains a great message. No talent or skill has merit by itself, but must be placed at the service of a higher purpose. It is a warning for the narcissistic artist and for anyone with a selfish creative force. This is not stated ostensibly at any time in the movie, however. Instead, we are treated to a wonderful adventure, with complex characters, extraordinary choreography and inspiring images of nature. The music is also beautiful and has become influential. The love story is touching and at times sublime. It does not really matter that the movie uses formulas that prevail in many popular Chinese adventures. History has many examples of popular formulas that are brought to the level of high art by insightful masters, and this is one of them.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just please don't laugh,"Or if you think that people flying while they fight are funny, don't watch this movie with people who take this seriously. It was really hard to concentrate on the movie, while I was in a cinema watching it, because many people just started laughing every time they saw people jumping around (on houses or over them). It seems strange that most of them would accept the same style in a western movie which came out 1999 (I will not name the movie, so I won't spoiler it for you, though I'm pretty sure, most of you will know which movie I mean), but couldn't bare to see it in HK movie, just because this one was based in reality?But enough about that, there is more to be said about the movie here too. About the fine acting, about the story that evolves through the fighting ... which means, the fight scenes are not just some stunt action scenes, they do tell you a lot about the story. That is because they are choreographed to keep building up the story or concluding it. There is one moment, where the movie takes a deep breath (in other words it feels like it does full stop), but other than that, the flow is extra ordinarily good!If you like a little fantasy with your martial arts mixed with a strong story and a good cast, then you don't have to look further!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Kung fu at its most poetic and beautiful,"If you like martial arts flicks, you just have to see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It's so incredibly good, it made me fall in love with Asian cinema.Ang Lee's Oscar-winning magnum opus succeeds where most similar movies failed: to keep the personal, intimate story and the awesome, huge action on the same level, never letting one prevail on the other. The beautifully choreographed duels are exactly as important as the dialogue-heavy intermissions (or maybe the fights are intermissions). Think Lawrence of Arabia, only with small fights in the forest instead of massive combats in the desert.The locations where the characters fight are a crucial part of the film's greatness: never has a duel looked so beautiful as when two people follow each other jumping from tree to tree, their movements so gracious and the combat itself so elegant and bloodless. It's like The Matrix in terms of visual delight, but more poetic.The acting is perfect as well: Chow Yun-Fat is excellent in the unusual role of the retired warrior who is reluctantly forced back into action, Michelle Yeoh is of good support as his would-be love interest, and it's no wonder Ziyi Zhang has become one of the most wanted actresses in the world. She's astounding, playing such a layered character so well at such a young age.Beautiful and tragic, it's something you just have to see. As soon as you possibly can.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I didn't understand all the excitement,"Before I begin, I must point out that I like samurai and martial arts movies. So I didn't watch this film with a negative mind set.This movie is neither good nor bad--it has some of each aspect. First the bad. While MANY loved the bizarre and over-the-top action sequences (complete with wall walking and flying across the trees), I didn't. It only served to obscure the good writing, photography and acting. Many praised it, but it just seemed a little dopey--sort of like combining a kung fu movie with a Sylvester Stalone or Disney pic. Second, few films can match the hype surrounding it. By the time I saw it, my expectations were too high. I do like some of the old-time Hong Kong kung fu movies--in these films with cheesy special effects and over-the-top action, such excesses are to be expected. In a big-budget and more Western-oriented film, it all just seems out of place.Now the good. It was a visually stunning movie and generally kept my interest. That's really about it. Maybe you'll like it, but I was left feeling amazingly flat and unimpressed.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ang Lee's Best Film to Date as of 2006,"First, I don't think it matters that there are subtitles and the language is Chinese. The story is strong and moves along smoothly. The fighting scenes are worth watching alone. The actors are choreographed to dance and fight with you just wanting to see who defeats. The story is also told with great costumes, art direction, and scenery. The stars of this film are Asian actors and actresses who don't get enough work in this business. While the subtitles might throw you off, it's not hard to understand what's going on by studying their actions, movements, and facial expressions. If Ang Lee had the actors talk in English throughout the film, I don't think it would have lost much value to me since I'm not Asian or Chinese or the audience. I believe that this is one of the best foreign language films of the last decade and it was awarded an Oscar for Foreign Language Film. Although I don't think Ang Lee cared about awards in making this film, this film has female characters who are both strong and equal to the male characters in the film. The females sometimes steal the scenes from the men. It's nice to see women portrayed as strong, equals than emotional inferior characters. They are equally adept at the fighting scenes and they give their all to those scenes. When you think of Ang Lee's other films, nothing could really master the beauty and uniqueness of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Over Rated!,"This was OK, nothing too inspiring.The flying scenes were a little over done. Almost thought I was watching a superman movie.The female lead acted superbly and should have been nominated for an Oscar.The cinematography was of the highest calibre.Unfortunately the male lead was quite wooden.Wouldn't see it a second time. I find it hard to believe that many are picking it for a Best Picture Oscar. The rest must be pretty bad for this one to be the best.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful and Touching,"This film is one of my personal favorites. The choreography is breathtakingly graceful. The plot is exciting with a beautiful ending that is a true surprise. The rhythm in which the actors deliver their lines is quite poetic and beautiful, even to me, a person who does not understand any Mandarin Chinese (I'd recommend using subtitles without voice overs, just so you may experience the beauty of the language). Ziya Zhang (who plays Jen) is my favorite actress and this film is what introduced me to her, as well as Chinese foreign films. The scenery is spectacular and the costumes are just lovely. It has plenty of action packed scenes, but a sweet, romantic side to it as well that makes it very appealing to a wide variety of people.This movie is definitely one you will want to watch again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Beautiful, Fascinating.....And Yet Uninvolving","I gave this film two chances. I watched it subtitled and I watched the dubbed version. Both times I felt the same way: enjoyed the visuals, the leading ladies but couldn't warm up to the film nor most of its characters. In the end, I dumped the DVD. I guess you could call it a doubled-edge sword, pun intended.THE GOOD - On one side of the ""sword,"" you have some beautiful scenery in here. ""Spectacular"" might be a better description. It also features two pretty women: Zhang Ziyi and Michelle Yeoh. The latter looked the better of the two, at least in this film. The stunts, of course, are jaw-dropping. They were ""news"" back when this movie came out because no one - at least Western audiences - had quite seen people flying around like this doing swordplay while floating from rooftop to rooftop, etc. Nowadays, of course, since this film came out, we've seen it in subsequent movies such as ""Hero,"" ""House of Flying Daggers,"" ""Kill Bill"" and more.THE BAD - On the other side of the sword, you have a story and characters that are just too difficult to get involved over. The characters aren't presented well enough for us to passionately root for some of them. I also don't go along with the Liberal critics who always think it's cool with women beating up all the men, as is the case much of the time here. It's stupid and unrealistic.FINAL NOTE: I watched the dubbed version and the Mandarin version with subtitles. Both are excellent. Usually I prefer the subtitles but the dubbing was done so well that in this case, you should be fine with either choice.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ang Lee's kung fu masterpiece,Master Li Mu Bai (Yun-Fat Chow) is weary of fighting and asks Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) to deliver his personal The Green Destiny Sword to Sir Te in Peking. Jiao Long (Ziyi Zhang) is the daughter of Governor Yu and also a guest of Sir Te. She is to be married but she yearns for adventures. Then a thief comes in one night to steal the sword.This is Ang Lee's kung fu masterpiece. He marries a more western story with all the high wire fighting and traditional Chinese settings. There are themes here that are universal. The action is brilliantly staged. The look is lush and beautiful. This is more than a simple kung fu action movie. It is a fully realized masterpiece.,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the most stirring and dazzling martial arts films ever made. ***1/2 (out of four),"CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON / (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French: ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a stirring, sweeping, engaging, and action-packed epic achievement in filmmaking; it is one of the best foreign films I have seen in a long time. It demonstrates martial arts is not about fighting or daring stunts, but about personal achievement, honor, and dignity. The villains in this kind of story are almost always people who use their artful abilities for evil or selfish completion. The heroes are overcome by duty and achievement, and often defy limitation of physiology and mental solicitude. This movie confirms those ideas in such a method that we cannot take our eyes off the screen even for a second.Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a massive giant over movie landscape of previous attempts to portray the art of martial arts in a meaningful voice. Jackie Chan is the most popular of today's martial artist actors, but I cannot figure out why. Jackie Chan's movies are stupid, contain thin and distant stories, and almost regularly fail to engage or provide anything but a few shallow laughs and dozens of action sequences. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is the perfect tool for me to express my resentment with Jackie Chan movies.""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" does contain such absurdities as seen in Jackie Chan productions; there are sequences where the characters defy the laws of gravity, glide over rooftops, rush up the sides of walls, and leap from one house to another. These scenes are so much more convincing than Jackie Chan aimlessly scampering down the sides of lofty structures, though. Why? Because what happens is in the spirit of the characters' convictions and possibilities. When Jackie Chan does these stunts, he does them simply because he can. There is no realization in mindless action, but there is in such sheer physical grace of the scenes in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""The fight sequences can also help determine the difference between this movie and ""The Legend of Drunken Master,"" ""Shanghai Noon,"" ""First Strike,"" ""Mr. Nice Guy,"" or any other recent Jackie Chan action frolic. Chan uses fast-paced fighting to provoke laugher of disbelief, but the scenes are not defined within the context of the plot and are always contrived and feel forced. Like the scenes in Jackie Chan films, long training hours went into preparation, and they are beautifully choreographed. But the unique content in that separates ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" from other films of this genre is the great depth and rhythm of how they connect with the story.Unlike Chan films, the script and character motives are not just clotheslines for senseless action, but are idyllic, ethereal and meaningful to advance the story. Chow Yun-Fat, who finally redeems himself after some extraordinary failures, co-stars with Michelle Yeoh, whom both are experienced martial artists. Yun Fat plays a warrior named Li Mu Bai who vowed to avenge the murder of his master done in by the evil Jade Fox (Cheng Pei Pei). This villain also stands between two characters' affectionate feelings for each other. She has arranged for the capture of a soulful sword one belonging to Li Mu Bai's master, and only Li Mu Bai can return it to its rightful owner.Screenwriters James Schamus, Wang Hui Ling and Tsai Kuo Jung amazingly capture the deep sentiment of the human love story, which is not the usual hokum, but touching and uplifting. Ang Lee allows for an unusual long but necessary flashback that is more of a separate story than a sequence. Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh dazzle on screen as they master the delicate martial arts techniques. The fight sequences are so enticingly photographed, the sheer image of the characters battling on screen acquires unmatched escapism. Before watching ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" first examine the qualities of a Jackie Chan production, the overwhelming achievement of this film will be even more apparent. You may never look at martial arts films the same way again.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
20th Anniversary!,"The emerald sheen of a bamboo forest, lovers beneath a vivid desert sky strewn with shooting stars, mountain waterfalls, fantastic stories from ancient China; moments from the most remarkable film seen in my life. For twenty years it stood the test of time.Master warrior Li Mu Bai is settling down and about to tell his secret crush Yu Shu Lien of his love for her, but fate intervenes in the form of a mysterious and beautiful stranger, Jen Yu, who swipes his enchanted and powerful sword Green Destiny. Jen is gorgeous, talented, mischievous and charming, and she is being pulled in different directions by those intent upon winning her affections. There are stronger tugs from within her heart. Jen takes Green Destiny at the request of one of her influencers, but also to shake things up and see how they play out. She will get much more than she wished for. Jen is toying with powerful emotions and there is no action without reaction.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is my all-time favorite film. It combines all the elements I love in film and in absolute perfection with each element. One example. The music for the final scene (performed by Yo-Yo Ma) is haunting and beautiful on its own, but it also melds so perfectly to the characters, the arc of the story and the imagery of the scene that they all seem intertwined. They build on each other. It brings tears to my eyes. The whole film is like this, full of splendor and depth.Wherever I focus my gaze and attention there is beauty. The settings in China are stunning. I recently visited Hongcunzhen where the opening scene of the film takes place and it is every bit as attractive as displayed on screen. The culture of ancient China is fascinating and the complex characters are just as dazzling. Appropriately, there is good and bad in each character. Men and women are on equal footing throughout (no sexism or narrow-mindedness here). The romances are realistic and sensual, the story is captivating from start to finish, costumes are colorful and intricately designed, and the dialogues - including ancient legends from distant lands - are deep and meaningful.The action scenes are as resplendent as they are cathartic. Some people chide the film for its exaggerated, flying fight scenes, but I think they add to the brilliance and splendor. The acting by Zhang Ziyi (Jen), Chow Yun-Fat (Li Mu Bai), Michelle Yeoh (Yu Shu Lien) is masterful, wonderful. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon won four Oscars including best foreign film, music, cinematography and art direction, and was nominated for six more. It was the best film too, but Hollywood wasn't ready for it I guess.My fascination with Jen, played by the amazing Zhang Ziyi, is one of the reasons that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon so appeals to me. I married a woman like Jen; attractive, adventurous, unyielding, defiant, conflicted, and emotionally charged. Deep down Jen is good, but she expects too much. Swayed too far by desires and fears, she risks becoming a poisoned dragon. So do we all. ""Whatever path you take in life,"" says Jen's lover Dark Cloud ""be true to yourself."" I stand with Dark Cloud in this wish.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lensed with western eyes in mind,"Back in 2000, I gave a rousing take on CTHD long before the Hollywood Marketing machinery made it into a western cultural phenomenon. I was lying then....Being of Chinese descent, I just could not bring myself to come down too hard on a landmark movie so many people associate as a beacon of Chinese/ Asia cinema. But with the passage of time and the buzz all but fizzled, I see fit to bring up my alternate take on this whole ""CTHD"" phenomenon.   Crouching Tiger Hidden Tiger, despite its many accolades by Western critics and audiences alike, alienated many discerning Asian audiences(including myself).Granted, it was a technically and aesthetically accomplished film. But it lacked a distinct Asian feel that is hard to put to words. Films by Zhang Yimou(To Live) or even Ang Lee's past efforts(Eat Drink Man Woman) had that elusive, thematic quality, but not CTHD.Many in Asia thus felt that CTHD(whether intentional or otherwise) ""relented"" too much in its attempts to meet a western checklist of what constituted a good Asian film (exotic location, death defying choreography, sweeping epic plot with hidden underlying themes etc).At this point, do let me clarify that I am not a backlash critic. I don't exactly hate CTHD. I am just disappointed that it was so blantantly pandering to western tastes, when it could have retained its Asian sensibilities and still achieved greatness on the international front(much like Zhang Yi Mou or Miyazaki Films).Either way, CTHD notwtihstanding, I do not think Asian films will truly arrive on the international stage as long as films like CTHD still get the disproportionate western response in lieu of its equally, if not more important Asian acceptance.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"No writer in western history has built a more satisfying legend of heroism,","Nothing I can say about this film will do it justice. Forget that it's in Mandarin, you will anyway after a few minutes of watching. Much has been made of the fact that the lead actors were not native speakers of Mandarin, but the fact that they learned their dialog and were able to emote within the tightly confining inflective structure of the language speaks to the amount of skill, effort, and dedication that went into making this masterpiece. And yes, the main characters can fly, so it isn't exactly cinema verite', but we accept far more from movies that do far less to convince us to do so. What CTHD is is a stunning, epic telling of a beautiful Chinese fable that rivals any in Western culture.Try to remember the first time you heard about King Arthur and Camelot; it's chivalry and gallantry, the characters larger than life. Recall the epic and tragic story arcs of heroes whose literary personas evolved from the greatest traditions of Western culture. CTHD has all of that and more. For Camelot fans, there's even a magical sword. When it is stolen by a mystical warrior of dazzling skill, the quest for its return leads us through a story that contrasts the formal beauty of feudal China with its danger and brutality.The majesty of this film comes from Taiwanese director Ang Lee's masterfully controlled and yet lavish treatment. Lee is decidedly Taiwanese in his approach, which, for those who have missed the last half century or so of history, means that it will weave Eastern and Western sensibilities into a truly global worldview. It is a tragedy that Lee went on to direct the dismally disappointing Hulk, an overblown effects-laden stinker. It is best we forget that and remember him for this quintessential and epic creation. The ethereal fight scenes have been compared to The Matrix, but that is a huge disservice to CTHD. Even Matrix, with is wheezing spiral into itself pales by comparison against the rapturous beauty of Lee's masterpiece.The ending takes a bit of thought to embrace, and a knowledge of the Asian theme of heroism through sacrifice is essential to understanding it. If you know anything about China in the twentieth century, you will know that all individual glory must end in sacrifice to larger goals. The final scene, delicate as a flower yet as powerful as any warrior, uses this ethic to beautifully meld the seemingly disparate story lines into a glorious and tragic, in the literary sense, climax that will leave those willing to invest the thought to grasp it utterly breathless. No writer in western history has built a more satisfying legend of heroism, nobility and spiritualism. CTHD launched a series of cheap imitations, including the sadly inferior Hero and House of Flying Daggers, which are both excellent films in their own right, but practically a television movie of the week remake when judged against the rhapsodic beauty and majesty of CTHD.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as quite what I had expected,"I was dying to see this movie as the United States people love this movie. Well,I had just saw it and it  was not quite up to my expectation. From my Asian perspective, this movie just used the same formula that Hong Kong and China  had  used in their martial arts movies all this time. This movie is more slow paced compared to other martial arts movies  dated back since 1980-s. Seriously said, I was born in a country where Cantonese, Mandarin, Hindi, Tamil, English and even  Japanese movies  are screen almost everyday in  the television.I had seen a lot of movies  that I don't think even arrive in the United States. Of course, one might say, the acting in this movie was superb, but , I just might say, I had seen much better than this. The movie just have some famous Hong Kong actors who had made their debut in Hollywood (Chow Yuen Fatt and Michelle Yeoh). I had seen a lot of Chinese movies, so I guess again, there's nothing new. Don't get me  wrong, even people in Malaysia  who had  seen this movie are commenting the same thing.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Enjoyable, a good stepping stone to more Chinese Cinema","This was the first film I ever saw out of Mainland China, and it hooked me immediately.The story is very balanced, a good mix of action with an interesting plot, there are scenes that make you laugh, cry & simply be amazed at the wire-work.Chow Yun Fat delivers a brilliant performance, something you can always expect from him, playing alongside an amazing actress, Michelle Yeoh, these two alone make it a film worth watching.The supporting cast are a dream to watch, with little sub-plots that are often missing from western films.Unfortunately Ziyi Zhang does not perform very well, and she is a bit wooden in her acting. Fortunately her opposite in the film Chen Chang holds their scenes together.Its not just an action film, but a good drama.I have only rated it 6/10 because there are so many better films out of China, but I would say this is much better than most of the films out of Hollywood today.I would recommend you watch this, and then soon after go and start watching more Chinese Cinema films.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I didn't like it.,"It consisted of what seemed like hours of fantasy sword fighting.  The kind where no blood is seen.   Childish cartoon-like violence, punctuated by simple-minded dialog and story line.At least in the original Zorro, Douglas Fairbanks does some impressive acrobatic leaps (assisted by a hidden trampoline),  and later on TV, Guy Williams charms us with bloodless swordplay that is teasingly brief.  But in this film, the fantasy sword fights are all faked up with walking up walls and flying, and they seem to go on forever.By the way, there is no consistency to the magical abilities of the fighters.  Sometimes they can fly, sometimes not.  Anything to make the fight more fair.The love interest in the story is a mass murdering bandit who happens to be cute, so that makes him ok.  The dialog and the storyline are both childish. But not childish in a captivating way... as in City of Lost Children... rather in an awkward unthinking way.This picture wanted to make murder and slashing people with swords seem like.. fun.  Something you do on a blind date; charming, sexy, and winsome.I found it to be creepy and insidious.  Give me Hannibal any day.. where murder is depicted as horrible and repulsive.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I can't even begin to describe it.,"""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" has essentially become part of our world view, and justifiably so. I can't even begin to describe how masterful this movie is. The plot of course has some warriors trying to recapture a stolen sword, but that's the bare minimum. The movie is a fantasy brought to real life in every sense. It is something that you will remember for eternity. Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi make the characters superhuman, but never silly (although Zhang Ziyi's battle in that one scene almost seemed like comic relief). Anyway, this is the sort of movie that you have to see to believe. And believe it you will.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not only does it have all the elements that make a good film, there is something very majestic also at work here. I'm sure how Ang Lee has done it, but he has achieved in my eyes a level of filmaking i have not yet come across anywhere else.If i had three wishes, one of them would be that i be lucky enough to see more films like this one.

A wonderfully complex and refreshing movie,"In what can only be described as one of the most breath-taking and original movies in years, Wo hu zang long is sure to pleasantly surprise and intrigue any viewer.Woefully typecast as a ""kung-fu"" movie, Wo hu zang long is a complex, deep, and thought provoking drama/love story, set against the beautiful and mystical lands of ancient China.  The main characters, of which there are several, are all wonderfully portrayed.  The complex motivations and interactions of the cast is a long overdue contribution to recent films, and any viewer will feel themselves hanging onto their seat as the plot twists and turns.  Bitter enemies reconcile, and the certain future becomes very uncertain several times throughout the course of this film.The cinematography of Wo hu zang long is amazing.  Clearly, this film was crafted rather than made, as even the most banal conversations are shot from pleasing angles, views, and shadows.  Action is heightened, characters are emphasized, and nothing is missed by the camera.The action sequences of this film are nothing short of amazing.  The marathon fight between Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi is one of the best showcases of martial talent ever captured on film.  Yeoh in particular demonstrates an awe-inspiring level of skill in her art.Wo hu zang long will leave no one dissapointed at the theater this year.

Chop-Suey of Kung-Fu Movies -- A Festival of Clichés.,"Imagine that you are from a small town in the middle of nowhere, and the only Chinese restaurant is a chop-suey house on the cross road.  Everybody raves about it, even though its menu consists of only sweet-and-sour chicken balls, fried rice, and won-ton soup.This is the feeling I got after getting out of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""  There are lots of eye candies, and I must admit that the scenery is simply breathtaking.  The acting were very well done, though I had trouble with most of the dialogue (I don't speak mainland Chinese, and I make a point not learning it.)  Well, sometimes you *do* come across a chop-suey chef who actually cares about taste.Taste alone, however, does not cover up some of the movie's fundamental flaws.  First, ""Hidden Tiger"" goes way off tangent with certain characters so much that there is almost no time to develop other's.  This leaves the film very unbalanced.  Second, the fight scenes, the scenes which make ""Hidden Tiger"" a kung-fu movie than anything else.  It almost looks like there is only enough budget for guy-wires and nothing else.  In other words... people fly all over the place, most of the time.  Finally, the plot elements themselves are very cliché, and the pace in exploring these elements is nonetheless too slow for what they are worth.  For a veteran kung-fu movie viewer, this only spells frustration.This is not to say that ""Crouching Tiger"" is poorly done.  In fact it is quite tasteful, and its quality surpasses most kung-fu films I have seen. But everything else is as creative as any 19th century English novel.  The only reason people are giving ""Crouching Tiger"" raving reviews is because most of them have much experience in kung-fu movies, like the way people rave about that chop-suey house in the middle of nowhere.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Greatest Movie Ever Made,"You may look at my summary and think: ""are you crazy? It is a Kung-fu Film!"" But I stand by what I say, this movie is perfect. First and foremost, I must denounce the common misconception that this movie is weak on plot. It has the most intricate plot in film. I could go into a summary, but I want to avoid the spoiler tags and convince people to see this. You will not notice the plot of this film the first time that you watch it, nor the second time. It is a complex net that slowly falls into place. Why do people notice it so slowly? It may have something to do with being distracted by the fights, or it may just be too subtle, but I guarantee, there is a strong plot there.In other matters, the acting is surprisingly strong (especially from Michelle Yeoh) and the organization of the story and editing is outstanding. Even the screenplay, a rare treasure considering the film is thought of as a Kung-Fu film, adds to the poetic feel of the movie. But finally, the true secret to this masterpiece is the tranquility created by the visual/audio combination. With one of the best scores ever, that sets a very relaxing mood, it complements the visuals of the film beautifully. Between the stunning on location scenes and the authentic sets, the art direction is flawless. And the key to the stunning visuals is truly the cinematography. As the music builds, you feel the perfection of the shot is building, and even the overall film. Even without the great plot, strong acting, and poetic screenplay, surely the score complements the cinematography in a way that is artistically unmatched. This film is sublime. I want to die watching it, and listening to the Yo-yo Ma Cello solo, looping and waving, like bamboo rustling in the breeze.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too much brouhaha,"I found all the martial arts scenes exactly as had been described to me by friends....more like ballet than fighting.  Especially fine was the scene on top of the bamboo.  The visual effects were really quite interestingly done. The main characters were believable; I especially liked the contrast of the understated love affair between the older couple with the lust-driven affair of the younger couple.  I did not find the music ""too Eastern"" for my ears - at least not for the 2 hours I was exposed to it. The cinematography was superb, especially in the panoramic views of landscape and the various scenes involving caves and retreats.However, I cannot understand the extreme ecstasy that this film has obviously brought to so many viewers. I'm glad that I saw it in the theater rather than wait for it to come out on video for two reasons:  1) the total effect of the visual would have been lost; 2) I probably would have turned it off after 10 or 12 minutes at home and picked up the nearest book.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I need to add to this point that by that time I had watched many many films regarding kung-fu, mostly old movies with Lee and Chan and these movies were the reason I started practicing martial arts from a young age. So I went to the cinema hoping to watch another Kung Fu movie. Oh boy, I was wrong. This movie is a masterpiece. I have watched it several times ever since. It is so special. It is not about Kung Fu. It is about love,loyalty, living for a higher purpose. I need to say that I only enjoy this movie in Chinese. In English it is not that great to watch because it looks fake.

The most over-rated film this year/century?,"Some pretty skilful cable and camera work has been employed to create some wholly unsatisfying fight scenes, which each seem to resolve absolutely nothing, and unfortunately there is really not much else to this film.The characters are hovering somewhere between one and two dimensions, their motivations are so blandly stated that its hard to swallow the action that ensues for these paper thin fantasy figurines. Their adventures lack any discernable logic and their personalities are so frigid it is hard to feel any compassion or antipathy for them as they each examine the crossroads at at which they find themselves.The critics are calling it sublime, exquisite and subtle - I fear I must disagree. It couldn't seem to decide if it was a love story/tragedy, an action/martial arts adventure, or a wispy parable (about the getting of wisdom versus the getting of knowledge). I felt like I was watching ""Monkey Magic"" on Prozac, or ""GI Jane"" on magic mushrooms - without a compelling soundtrack, plot or acting, the majority of the movie takes tself far too seriously, presumably to impress the arthouse crowd, with the only enjoyable snippet of the movie, for me, when it briefly lightens up in a bar full of beefy warriors. 1 (awful) out of 10 for me.....",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Hanging tiger, ballet dragon","After watching this movie I felt both puzzled and disappointed. As a matter of fact,being a couch potato I usually admire martial arts films when they are life-like and plausible (e.g. Jackie Chan films, Bruce Lee films and Jet Li). The stunts of that film were very much artificial: characters seem to be dancing, not fighting, and it's very disconcerting to see people perform tricks obviously suspended from thin lines. I believe such awkward glorification of the characters' mastership only does them wrong, as it looks funny and destroys the intended effect. If the whole story is meant to be a fairy tale, then let it have more attributes of such, then flying and water-skimming won't seem so ridiculous. The female parts were much better than that of Chow Yun Fat, at least they were capable of some emotion and he was ""too far gone on the way to perfection"". The only thing I liked is the jump of Jen in the last moment of the film and the legend about making wishes come true.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"At last a successor to Kurosawa, successful in his own right...","There's not much that cannot be said in praise for this director and not anything that deletes from a masterpiece like Crouching Tiger... Despite a relatively small number of films listed in IMDb, the actual list of nominations and awards given to Ang Lee's films speaks for itself - lately in connection with the Academy Awards late last night which yielded three well-deserved prizes for Brokeback Mountain.It is good to see a director who is in full command of everything, who has a strong sense of poetry and who communicates true epic grandness on a scale that can be used at its full advantage whether the film is set in the Far East (Crouching Tiger...) or in the ""Wild"" West of USA (Brokemack Mountain). I think the greatest impression I have from these two films is a strong and warm feeling of humanity and frailty seen through an epic dimension similar to that of Akiro Kurosawa's last films, with no signs of coyness and no cloying sentimentality - Ang Lee has a straightforward approach to human suffering that can appeal to anyone, anywhere, as well as a sense of humour that gives the audience just the right degree of distance without any feeling of estrangement.Having been a Kurosawa devotee for most of my adult life (I'm in my sixties) I was greatly relieved when, after seeing Crouching Tiger..., I could lean back and know that the Japanese master of the cinema at last had a true and worthy successor. Brokeback Mountain confirmed this impression fully.And I'm sure that together with many other cinema-goers I can look forward to his next venture, convinced that whatever subject matter, setting and era he might choose, we can expect something truly original and spectacular (in the true sense of that word) and at the same time an intimate and personal experience...",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Was I watching the same movie?,"I think I could have really enjoyed this movie if: a) the love flashback scene was believable b) the movie was made longer to do the complex sub plots justice c) the dialog didn't have that tinge of Cantonese in it d) it wasn't soooo badly edited e) the rooftop sequence didn't have that CG feel to itFor those who complain about the flying, walking on water...etc.  You obviously have no idea about Chinese folklore, this isn't a Matrix ripoff. In fact if anything the Matrix rips off true Chinese martial arts movies and I'm not talking about Bruce Lee movies either.I liked the movie but the subtitles must have been badly translated if there are so many people who loved the dialog. What I really detested about this film was the fact that it is a film made for Hollywood trying to pass itself off as a Chinese movie.  However, I must add that Ang Lee can shoot a movie beautifully.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A very moving picture,"The first time I heard about this movie was on NPR(National Public Radio).Teri Gross was interviewing someone about the movie and it sounded interesting.I got a chance to see it on HBO about a month or so later and I was so moved by it,the next time it came on I made a tape of it.My wife then bought me a DVD copy when see realized how much it had moved me.Although the DVD can be programmed to broadcast it in a number of options,I prefer it in the original Cantonese w/subtitles.Somehow the English speaking version loses some of the emotion.The part that really moved me to tears was when as Le Mui Bai(Sp)lay dying and utters his last words.It impressed me enough to paint it on the back of my automobile with a dedication to my wife.I guess it sums up my feelings for her.Thank you for an incredible movie.Ray Smith",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Exciting and silly at the same time,"The first part of this movie has some of the most incredible fighting scenes ever seen in any movie. They are even better then those in ""the Matrix"". That being said, the Matrix did offer a plausible explanation about why people are able to float in mid-air and walk up a wall. This movie offers no such explanation (at least, I can't remember it), which is OK during the fights because they are so exciting. However, this movie also features several very silly chase scenes in which the characters pursue each other by literally ""floating"" over roof tops, and one very silly scene about a fight in the top of large pine trees. These scenes really stretch the bounds of credibility..The rest of the movie is pretty average: nice costumes, nice acting, but nothing special. The story is pretty hard to grasp and turns into a really tiring love story in the second half. All of the good fights are in the first half of the movie too, and the end of the movie is an anti-climax.All in all I really don't understand what's so great about this movie. It's well made, it has some exciting fights, but it's also plain silly, boring and cliche at too many times. I'd give it ** out of **** stars",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Another ""Dippy"" Kung Fu Movie","I still can't see what everyone else is raving about when it comes to this movie.

A beautiful story of good v's evil and unrequited love,"When a mystical sword is stolen it sparks a quest to find the thief, who may or may not be the mysterious Jade Fox.  This not only causes the unrequited love between Master Bai and Yu Shu Lien to be further postponed by duty, but also signals the development of Jen Yu and her romantic discovery.  As the identify of the thief is gradually revealed a showdown looms with both Bai and Lien representing the good and the thief representing evil.A wonderful film in that it managed to make a whole generation of multiplex-only movie watchers that not all good things only come out of America.  However there is much to enjoy in this film that still will have been lost on such an audience.  The film mixes a raft of subplots around the main focus of the theft of the sword.  However we also have the development, romance and envious greed of Jen Yu, the conflict between Yu and Yu Shu Lien and of course the love between Master Li Mu Bai and Lien that has been put off due to duty.The stories all work well - the mystery surrounding the stolen sword and the search for Jade Fox make for a compelling mystery while the romance between Master Bai and Lien is beautifully observed throughout.  The story surrounding Jen Yu is very good as it follows her development throughout however her desert romance is perhaps a little too slow for a martial arts movie.  The only complaint about the stories is that they are a little heavy for a martial arts film - or maybe there is too much fighting for a well plotted movie?  Actually it's probably a brave mix that has some of the best of both worlds.The martial arts action is sensational - Yuen Wo Ping excels himself with one stunning visual treat after another.  The wire work is great even by Hong Kong standards - imagine the impact this had on an audience who thought that wire-work had been invented by the Matrix!  The standout scenes are the battle between Lien and Jen Yu and the Jen Yu's battle in a crowded barroom. The only complaint I did have is that the treetop fight near the end was not as exciting as other scenes and was also the least realistic and came across as silly at times.  In terms of visuals, the film is beautifully shot and picks up the gorgeous Chinese landscape well - the only problem being that this seems to distract from the main story.Michelle Yeoh is as impressive and as beautiful as she is in everything else I've seen her in - you can keep your Julia Roberts rom-coms, I want more of Yeoh's acting talents rather than pure star power.  Chow Yun-Fat is excellent as Master Bai and he works well in his scenes with Yeoh.  He even manages the martial arts really well despite not having made one before but I would have liked to see first choice Jet Li in the role.  The standout is Zhang Ziyi in only her second film.  She shines in the most difficult character and manages to convey so much and still be excellent in complex fight scenes.  And how does Hollywood reward her? By sticking her in Rush Hour 2!  That's like taking a beautiful flower and trying to plant it in the middle of a concrete slab!Overall it's a little slow for the martial arts crowd but it is a wonderful mix of Lee's art house films and the martial arts genre.  At times the mysticism gets a bit too heavy to be truly meaningful but it's an exquisitely beautiful piece of filmmaking.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Magical, Beautiful Looking Love Story","""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Wo hu cang long)"" is breathtakingly beautiful, the scenery, the cinematography, the martial arts choreography.But what a surprise that Ang Lee as the director of ""Sense and Sensibility"" incorporates that into the movie too!While my younger son just wanted to know upon my return from the theater if the martial arts were like ""Matrix,"" my husband sneered that it was too balletic (not a compliment from him), and I think what he really meant is that this is a chick flick.I totally didn't anticipate that this would be a sophisticated love story, let alone about two couples, and the various permutations of their relationships with each other, their teachers and their families. So this is really Jane Austen done as a mythic Chinese warrior movie.Michelle Yeoh is absolutely, maturely, captivating, especially in her sword fights with her protégé.""Over the hills and through the woods"" or ""up on the roof"" or ""wade in the water"" never had quite so literal yet so magical meanings as shown here. It makes for brilliant cinema.The music, with Yo Yo Ma solos, is wonderful.(originally written 1/20/2001)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A timeless tale about love and honour, an unmistakable masterpiece","""Wo hu cang long"" aka ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a timeless adventure tale, which takes place in ancient China, the eternal empire of heroes, gods and miracles. Li Mu Bai is a great warrior whose good deeds are known all around East. He decides to give his magical jade sword to an old friend of his, but a mysterious martial arts expert manages to steal the ancient weapon. Li must find out the identity of the thief and find his precious sword. But, the way of a warrior isn't as straightforward - love and honour have their own demands.I'm a big fan of Asian film making and to really watch Asian films you need this certain perspective, especially when it comes to these zen-films. Nevertheless this movie isn't a typical Asian film, as I'd more describe it as a film where Asian film making and Hollywood collide. You could think that it all goes wrong in the Hollywood -part, but for your surprise it doesn't. Ang Lee has created a fine piece of quality style, where you can sense both Asian and Hollywood which blend together like butter for a bread. The story, originally written by Du Lu Wang and turned into a screenplay by three writers, is absolutely beautiful, it includes twists and turns, it's dramatic and romantic, it's even thrilling and it has spectacular fighting sequences. To me the reason why this stands out from an usual eastern movie and where you can really know it's also Hollywood is the somehow different, even better, flow in the story and the amount of fighting sequences. Despite that I think this movie is suitable for both Asian and American audience, not forgetting the rest of the world. Each one gets satisfaction and you don't have to be a fan of Asian films or know anything about the history behind zen-movies, although you really need to be open minded.This leads me to, once again, the one thing I think Asian directors are better than any other directors of different nationalities; The cinematography. If you'd think there isn't anything Asian in this film, you can't deny the fact that the cinematography is. Once again we are shown endless landscapes, mind painted sceneries and this undeniable and precise harmony of professional operation of the camera, which is to me just amazing. It holds this beauty which you can't compare to anything else and that, if something, is the real heart of true dedication of Asian film makers. You can't really do anything else than just thank them about it, but it's enough that you know it yourself. These landscapes are complimented with the utterly tremendous music composed by Tan Dun, who has composed a main theme that'll melt the heart of even the most cynical person. For Asian film making it's very common to fit the music with the cinematography and the story, but I just can't get enough of it, it's always just that good and you just don't get bored of it. The best thing about the music is that you can't hear music like it in any other films, so it's always fresh for your ears if you've only watched movies from Hollywood. Asian instruments are always strong and compelling, being really significant for the overall feeling of the film and what's left after it.Even the role performances are excellent, so you'll get a full quality package. I think Yun-Fat Chow as Li Mu Bai makes his best role performance yet to date and Michelle Yeoh as Yu Shu Lien makes some pretty damn fine job as well. Ziyi Zhang is again the beautiful herself, being also a great actress as well, which makes her one of my favourite Asian actresses at the moment. Yun-Fat Chow and Michelle Yeoh have a really good chemistry with each other, which is somehow reflected as the chemistry between Ziyi Zhang and her co-star Chen Chang. Both couples work with each other superbly on screen, so the movie isn't a let down even in that department. When you get along with film you realise that these couples are sort of equal to each other, only that the characters have different names and the stories behind them are different; It's all about love in the end and when we finally get to the end there's an astonishing solution where tears won't be spared. When love and honour have their own demands they will become equal to each other, love will become honour and vice versa. It's really hard to explain and even harder to find out, but in any case the viewer isn't left without answers. You can make up your own mind about the ending though, so it's also really clever.""Wo hu cang long"" is without a doubt one of the best Asian films I've ever seen, everything in it matches and clicks, everything just gets along. The film isn't perfect, but to be honest it's really close in being one. It doesn't really have any major flaws and even the minor ones can't be explained. Like mentioned before you really need a certain perspective, or you need to be at least open minded, because let's face it; A film like this isn't for everyone. If you can't stand any films which define the laws of physics or which are somehow surreal I wouldn't really recommend this film to you. If you're just slightly open minded or at least have some remains of an open mind then please do watch it, as I'd say you won't be disappointed. ""Wo hu cang long"" even won a total of four Academy Awards, which is really an achievement for a foreign film. Just to name two, it won Oscars from the best cinematography and music, so I'm really not praising them for nothing. Just see this film. You even may be surprised by its magic and its affect on you.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cinematic Perfection!,"""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is one of the most recent of a number of cinema treats that I regard as perfect. Sure, one could change a word here, or trim a second or two from a scene there, but to what purpose? There's just no way I can imagine substantively improving this masterpiece. Great story, great actors (male and female), and magnificent action sequences. And scenes don't come along very often that are as touching as the final one with Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh. See it on a big screen if you haven't already. See it again on a big screen if you have. Then watch the fine DVD release from Sony. My only suggestion there is to stick with the subtitled version; the dubbed audio track just doesn't work at all, in my opinion. Thank you Ang Lee and all others involved.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","""Master Li"" (Chow Yun-Fat) asks his lifelong friend ""Yu Shu Lien"" (Michelle Yeoh) to take his legendary sword ""Green Destiny"" and deliver it to ""Sir Te"" (Sihung Lung) at the Imperial court. Turns out, though, that security there isn't so hot and the sword is stolen by a very able and nimble thief who only just escapes the pursuit of ""Shu Lien"" - who reckons she really knows whom the thief is. A visit to ""Jen"" (Ziyi Zhang) and the swift return of the sword seem to confirm her suspicions but then the sword is stolen again and aside from narking ""Sir Te"" this sets up a series of adventures for ""Li"", ""Shu Lien"" and ""Jen"" as we discover there may be a connection to the former man's nemesis ""Jade Fox"" (Pei-Pei Cheng). There is room, gradually, for a little romance but for the most part this is a quickly paced adventure that builds well on some beautiful cinematography with a solid story underpinned by some magical mythology and plenty of swordplay. Unlike many of the genre, the combat scenes are naturally choreographed and do not drag on interminably and repetitively. This has a more characterful narrative that involves us in the mystery, the vendetta - even the slowly simmering love story. For my money, this is easily the best film as yet made by Ang Lee and is well worth seeing on a big screen if you can find one.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The language of this film is not the words,"I cannot easily express the feelings I have for this movie. Watching it in Mandarin with English sub-titles made it even more ""transcendental"". I have never seen a movie so magical in its overall imagery. Even the Lord of the Rings cannot compare, simply because they used computers to create the magic and you can tell. In this spectacular movie, the Director is so innovative that I can never go back to the newer American-style movies. If you have your doubts, just watch this movie with an open mind. Women have the power. All the men.. are just a sideline and have their limited use to the power of these women. I gladly agree that Women have and need the most power in modern society. In this film though, Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang are sexy, powerful, inspiring, controlling, dynamic in their interactions and pure magic on the screen.Ang Lee has created a movie that will be held as a standard, not only for Martial Arts films, but all future romance films from this day forward.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Classic........,"According to the hype around Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, its creators have produced a miracle: a kung fu crossover hit, simultaneously a substantial foreign language drama for discerning art house audiences and the greatest martial arts movie of all time. Although Crouching Tiger falls short of such (probably unattainable) perfection, it is enormously fun, and manages to be one of the more interesting films of recent years. Whatever its flaws, it is also a rare example of fearless yet thoughtful experimentation by veteran filmmakers, in this case Ang Lee and James Schamus, who have previously collaborated on films in both Taiwan and the United States, including Eat Drink Man Woman and The Ice Storm.Though nominally set in the Qing dynasty, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is loosely based in a Chinese martial arts movie tradition that pits outlaws against heroes in a timeless ""long ago"" analogous to the American cinematic Old West. The Wuxia, warrior figures who embody honor, loyalty, and an individual sense of justice, can be compared to the white-hat guys; Wuxia stories gave rise to what Ang Lee has called ""a mythical, larger-than-life hero in the Chinese imagination,"" and an equally powerful myth of the Giang Hu world, an imagined ""Wild West"" underworld or outland, inhabited by the Wuxia and governed primarily by their noble ideals, with little regard for conventional mores.).Basing the screenplay on a series of novels by early 20th century novelist Wang Du Lu, Lee and co-writer Schamus people the simplistic Giang Hu world with complex characters whose actions result from a murky grapple with the tension between their needs as human beings and the demands that the Giang Hu world, as lived or imagined, place upon them. As the film opens, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat), the greatest swordsman in China and famed disciple of the Wudan martial arts system, has realized that the years spent fighting outlaws and striving for enlightenment have left him lonely and unhappy. He is on the verge of renouncing his life as a warrior to try to find happiness with his beloved friend and former comrade-in-arms Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh). As the film opens, he commits to the custody of longtime friend Sir Te his legendary sword, the beautiful, invincible Green Destiny, and is on the point of proposing to Shu Lien, who clearly shares his feelings, that they make a life together.His plans are interrupted by the reappearance of old foe Jade Fox (Cheng Pei Pei), who betrayed and murdered Mu Bai's master and stole the secret manual of Wudan's techniques. Resurfacing in Beijing, Jade Fox has become the governess of Yu Jen (Zhang Zi Yi), the daughter of a prominent government official. Slated for a loveless political marriage, Jen longs for any escape-into the remote deserts of her former home province; into an imagined world based on adventure tales, drawn from the real lives of warriors like Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien; into the arms of her secret love, a dashing barbarian bandit named Lo (Chang Chen).Her secret restlessness makes her vulnerable to manipulation by Jade Fox, but what makes her dangerous is her other secret: she is a martial arts prodigy of enormous potential. Half-trained by Jade Fox using the stolen Wudan manual, Jen has much of the technique but none of the Taoist philosophy; but even in this state she is a match for our heroes. Fascinated by the Giang Hu world (and her taste of it in her interlude with Lo), inspired by meeting Shu Lien, tempted by the now-idle Green Destiny, and poisoned by the influence of Jade Fox, Jen is a loose cannon, a menace to all those around her.Li Mu Bai, the embodiment of the Wuxia ideal, naturally wants revenge upon Jade Fox for her crimes against his master and his school; more than this, though, he wishes to take Jen as disciple to be Wudan's first female student - largely because without Wudan discipline she will surely become a villain far worse than her mistress. Shu Lien also comes to feel a sisterly affection for the young prodigy. Setting aside their personal needs, Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien take on Jade Fox in a struggle over the girl's fate, as the chaos swirling around her threatens to ensnare them all.True to its title, which names the animal pair most commonly representative of the contradictory and complementary principles of yin and yang in Taoist and Buddhist symbolism, the movie concentrates on the interaction of opposing forces. The consequences of impetuously pursuing one's desires contrast with the loss and regret that are the reverse of restraint and duty. The naive certainty of youth is weighed against the ambiguities of maturity. Jen's coming of age is juxtaposed against the mid-life conflict within Li Mu Bai. All of the main characters much decide when to fight to control their lives and when to acquiesce before forces that cannot be altered.The actors are well cast, and director Ang Lee coaxes great performances from most of them. As Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien, Chow and Yeoh smolder with their characters' repressed passions. The actors incorporate the spirit of swordplay in their performances and alternate between slow, taut exchanges and lightning flashes of intense emotion. They likewise maintain character through their fighting sequences, in which Yeoh's Shu Lien moves with confident virtuosity, and Chow's Li Mu Bai, the accomplished master, needs to use only the sparest, most efficient techniques. These megastar veterans of Hong Kong and Hollywood fearlessly play up their maturity, imbuing their performances with an exquisite sense of loss; the curious result is that they have never seemed sexier.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

If you want to focus on that part of the movie you should go find something else, and also learn to to respect cinema as a form of art, this being a masterful piece of work. If you want to watch this, its not about the fighting really. There are good fight scenes sometimes that are filmed rather well with good camera work, but the story itself is what holds the story together and is the important part.

The flashback sequence Zhang's character has in the desert, fighting with a desert bandit (Chang Chen) goes on for so long that we get less about the other two, but it's entertaining and gorgeous, and the unspoken romance Yeoh's character has with her old friend (Chow Yun-fat) is touching and tragic. The film has themes of discipline vs. impetuousness, honor vs. betrayal, and interestingly, following one's heart vs. the path of conformity. It's just a brilliant piece of filmmaking from Ang Lee, and an absolute travesty that it didn't win more Oscars (the best picture award to Gladiator that year is particularly galling).

A masterpiece,"It's 12 years since the movie was first released that I have a chance to watch it.

Good Movie - No masterpiece,"This is a good movie but something kept bothering me as I watched it. Then it struck me! I have seen this movie dozens of times before. It's a melodramatic Western (an eastern western?). I think the reason this movie is getting praised so wildly is because it is in Mandarin. Mainstream people are slapping themselves on their backs congratulating themselves they sat through a sub-titled movie and thus are now ""sophisticated"". I believe if this movie were made (not dubbed) in English it wouldn't achieve the acclaim it is receiving. The cinematography is outstanding - from the lush green mountains to the brittle desert. The acting is fine and the fight scenes amazing though tedious after a while. Add those elements with a predictable hackneyed script and characters and you have a good movie. I gave it a 6 out of 10. O Brother was a lot more fun and Not of This World was vastly superior. It's a good movie that I have nearly forgotten about - 3 days later.

Good looking movie with good fight but everything else...,"I can honestly appreciate a good material arts movie but I can simply not appreciate this movie as much as everyone else seems to do. The storytelling isn't always done in the best way and the movie has a bit too many slow and ridicules moments in it. It's by no means a bad movie, I still rate it a 7 out of 10. This is mainly thanks to the look of the movie. Visually there is very little wrong with the movie. The sets and costumes are good looking and the cinematography by Peter Pau and music by Dun Tan are splendid.The story didn't quite grabbed me and never really become interesting, tense or surprising. The at times absolutely horrible dialog also didn't do much good to the story and storytelling of the movie. Also none of the actors really impressed me.The fight are very over-the-top at times and I can't say that I was particularly fond of the whole zero-gravity fight elements in the movie. It was fake and odd looking most of the times and was simply too much over-the-top, even for a material arts movie. The 'normal' fights and mainly the ones involving also weapons were a real treat to look at. They were extremely spectacular and impressive to watch. Yes, it really are those fight sequences that make ""Wo hu cang long"" an original one of a kind movie, that still remains a must see simply for that very same reason.I was impressed by the fight sequences, not by the overall movie. I can still recommend this movie to everyone, you'll at least like the fight sequences and perhaps you'll also everything else of this movie. Anyway, there is no reason why you shouldn't watch this movie. You'll either like it (like I did), or love it, like most people seem to do.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Overrated!,"How this movie could be nominated for Best Picture is astounding. I guess it shows how weak the field really was. First, the good parts. The direction was very good, as was the cinematography. It was a beautiful film to look at, and the martial arts scenes were well edited and choreographed. The Bad Parts: plot, acting, story, martial arts. The plot has huge holes in it. Perhaps it loses something in the translation. Without giving anything away, why does Jen walk up the long stairs near the end when she can fly? Why doesn't Li just kill the bad guy when they first meet? The ending: I walked out of the theatre scratching my head going ""huh?"" There is no exploration of the character of Jen. She is simply a spoiled rich brat. And any transformation that she may or may not have had is not built up over time. It just happens. Or maybe she's just a spoiled brat who didn't get her way. The acting is difficult to judge fairly, since the dialogue was in mandarin and I don't understand it. But it was typically wooden, which artists might want to call stoic. The martial arts were ridiculous. While it was well choreographed and well performed, flying through the air? I kept waiting for Obi Wan to say, ""use the force Li"". Some people have equated it with ""The Matrix"". In the Matrix you could suspend belief because it wasn't real, it was virtual reality. Well here on terra firma the laws of physics still apply. If I were a producer, I would just make sure I filmed a movie in China with elaborate costumes and sets, and I would know I would have several invitations on Oscar night.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Crouching tigers,"crouching tiger hidden dragon is a masterpiece. It has that attitude you know, you either ride with us or collide with us. With the green scenery and the martial artist in this movie, one is left speechless as they create magnificent fight scenes. The story plot is somewhat complicated and difficult to understand if not careful, but wonderfully done. I think this movie is a great watch if you have an interest in martial art movies. The cast and costumes was excellent. I am still amazed by the special effects and have to give it up to the creators of the flick. The particular scene with the girl really lays an atmosphere of perfection.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Nearly a perfect experience.,"I rarely can sit through a 2 hour plus movie without pausing or at least feeling the need to scroll throgh my phone, or something. This movie takes so much classic Chinese lore and philosiphy and injects modern filmmaking into it. The shots are all spectacular, the sound is always great. To me, it'a a movie I want to watch in Chinese as it adds to the beauty of the experience (as pretentious as that may sound).I often find romance feels artificial in movies with a lot of action, but this story manages to combine two full movies without feeling fake, or cheesy, or < whatever >. It was made over 20 years ago but to me feels like the beginning of seamless modern special effects and film making and I cannot recommend this movie enough.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon poetically orchestrates a timeless love story through stylistic martial arts.","18th Century Qing dynasty, China. A sprawling blank canvas perpetuates the endless perimeters of the fictitious Wudang Sect. The paintbrush of fate, an instrument for creativity, dipped in blank ink. A sword dripping with viscous blood. Broad strokes are set in motion, where application and tool combine. ""Calligraphy is similar to fencing"", remarks Shu Lien as she subtly interrogates an aristocratic thief shackled by the restrictions of Chinese bureaucracy. ""Fighters have rules too. Friendship, trust, integrity. Always keep your promise. Without rules we wouldn't survive long"". The expressionless material perched on the silky cloth of privilege, now a vast illustration of loyalty and respect.Painting the destinies of its repressed characters. An accomplished Wudang swordsman, Mu Bai, suppressing his endearing love for Shu Lien out of loyalty for his recently deceased friend whom she was engaged to. Jen, the daughter of a rich and powerful governor, chosen to marry on their behalf, denying her true feelings for a reclusive bandit named ""Dark Cloud"". ""To repress one's feelings only makes them stronger"". A sentiment that director Lee nestled in the heart of Hollywood's introduction to the lyrical beauty of wuxia.To some, Crouching Tiger is a martial arts extravaganza boasting expertly choreographed fight sequences and mystical wire work. Yet, it is infinitely more detailed than a superfluous action blockbuster. At its core, beneath Pau's exquisite cinematography and Dun's traditionally authentic score, is a love story. A tale that masterfully exploits the limitations of its archaic dynasty to sentimentalise a modern affair. Revolving around the ""Green Destiny"", a mighty sword capable of obliterating the opponent's arsenal of weaponry with one swipe, the ornately implemented characters explore the struggles of power. Acting as a plot device to represent strength without control, ""Green Destiny"" is seen stolen on multiple occasions by a thief seemingly known to be the ""Jade Fox"". Lee invests plenty of narrative hold in the bulk of Dulu's novel, circumnavigating the history behind each character. But it's what he implicitly presents within the primary story that truly elevates the onscreen poetry.A striking progression for the sub-genre is the representation of women, depicting prominent martial arts styles to have been originated by females. Four of the five extensive fight sequences feature either Jen, Shu Lien or both, cementing their physical presence within the narrative. The weaponised duel between the two, a scene that sits amongst the very best in cinematic history, represents a battle for superiority. To assert methodical dominance, regardless of the instrumental tool of destruction. Notably, each choreographed sequence resembled a dance more than a raucous brawl, stipulating each move as a meticulous action for greater meaning.There is an infectious artistry that resides within the choreography, and the metrical screenplay that garnishes its love story. A script that heavily implies the obligations between a student and teacher, exploring the conflict and responsibility between the two. Jen and Jade Fox illustrating the exploitation of subordination when the student's limitless potential surpasses that of the teacher. Other prominent thematic strands, including gender reversal and the cowardly usage of poison, supply Crouching Tiger with a near infinite amount of angles to perceive its contents. A truly rare example where film is translated as art.Bolstering stoic yet sensual performances from all cast members. Yun-fat and Yeoh expertly conveying the emotional repression hidden within, with loyalty controlling their feelings, making their climactic scenes extraordinarily palpable. Ziyi embodying the tenacity of a naive inexperienced student whom exerts limitless potential. The only noticeable criticism that prevents Crouching Tiger from acquiring a perfect rating, is the substantial pacing issue when Jen's flashback of meeting Dark Cloud in the desert comes to fruition. It is haphazardly edited in and nearly detracts from the present story due to its elongated length.Regardless, the segment does not detract from Crouching Tiger's artistry. An accessible beauty for those uninitiated with the wuxia sub-genre, and a romance tale that avoids all clichés. The only fitting sentence to conclude this review, is with a personal favourite quote. ""Even if I was banished to the darkest place, my love will never let me be a lonely spirit. I would rather be a ghost drifting by your side as a condemned soul than enter heaven without you. Because of your love, I will never be a lonely spirit"".",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Gracious Butterfly","If Akira Kurosawa could live for a hundred years, he would have made movies like ""Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon"", an epic tale of love and duty told with stylish grace and poetry, and a good deal of action sequences, now, that's the most honest and serious compliment I can give to Ang Lee.His film has been regarded as the culmination of 'martial arts' movies but I'm not too hot about this label, because my mind can't help but associate it with Bruce Lee, Van Damme or Jackie Chan's flicks. I'm aware that 'martial arts' is the most popular genre in China or East-Asia in general and is widely associated to plots involving apprenticeship, relationships between masters and disciples, tales of revenges, of good vs. evil and quest for a sacred relics or an inner peace, well, while ""Tiger"" does handle these elements, it is beyond genre tagging, it is a film that tackles usual archetypes but with indomitable freedom and a style that can appeal to any movie lover. Still, ever since this film was made, there would be two Lees counting in the legendary scroll of Asian cinema.The film is about two skilled fighters: a master swordsman Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-fat) and female bodyguard Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) who have in common a precious loss, his former friend he promised to avenge and, her fiancée she promised to love and the same dedication to their duty, that feels like a decoy where they can hide the uncertain feelings toward each other, but that wouldn't fool an unwise eye. Li Mu Bai is instantly recognizable as a heroic figure but when we see him, he's a worn-out man, contemplating his burdens with a tired spirit. To seal this abandon, he decides to give up his sacred sword: ""Green Destiny"" and assigns Shu Lien to give it as a present to a friend in Beijing. There she meets Jen Yu, a governor's daughter played by Zhang Ziyi and whose governess (Cheng Pei-Pei) is revealed to be bandit Jade Fox (no spoiler as this comes quite early).The relationships between masters and disciples are vital to the film and they're all ambiguous and enriched with other personal subplots that unfolds like a rose under the sun, Jen Yu is a fiancée but has a lover in an impetuous desert bandit named Lo (Chang Chen) who also have projects for both of them, and Jen Yu remains the real mystery and core of the film, she's the leading role actually. And Ang Lee goes beyond the simplification of having just a hero, a villain and a quest. Anyone is actually a crouching tiger or a hidden dragon for that matter. It takes several viewings to really appreciate this film as you discover each time another layer of the characters' personalities, and it's never done without feeling like a character study, you can discover more about them during a fight, or a stare.Indeed, Asian cinema has this unique capability to be surprisingly quiet in a very heart-pounding way, and the counterpart is that the action sequences, meant to thrill you are hypnotic and you just stare at them as they didn't even belong to the film. ""Tiger"" is remembered for the gravity-defying combats where two characters can walk over a wall, jump miles ahead or literally fly over trees and there's never a moment where it feels over the top (no pun intended) or laughable, and that's a credit to the way Lee, surrounded by master visual effects and storytellers, know the audience and is aware that there's nothing as beautiful and dreamy as being able to fly, this is part of human subconscious, this is the ultimate challenge. These scenes have become immediate staples of the art martial genre and parodied everywhere, but even with that in mind, the choreographic battles are impressive.Ebert compared these actions to musical numbers in musicals, they're expected now and then as a relief or a plot punctuation, but I felt they had the same aesthetic value than in Stanley Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"", where, you forgot you were watching a film and you just admired the beauty of some shots, looking like Rembrandt and Vermer paintings. The beauty of ""Tiger"" and the cinematography are simply breathtaking, and it is so contagious that even the characters become part of it. There's a panoramic shot over a long wedding outfit, and it takes as long as it would to show a bamboo tree or a pagoda, but this is the dazzling and beautiful Jen. And then an arrow hits the rickshaw, she raises her curtain and the action starts. There's just something in Lee's directing that shows fighting with art and displays art with the soul of the fighter. Martial Arts came from the Art of War and that's exactly what you get in the film: battles and art.And like for the art, the greatest battles aren't necessarily in forest, arenas or castles under the moonlight but in the mind of tortured characters who are their worst adversaries. It might sound corny but not when Ang Lee is in the command and treats his material with a respect to the audience, one that provided one of the best-looking movies of the 2000's, and as today, the highest-grossing foreign movie of all time.The title comes from Chinese proverb ""Behind the rock in the dark probably hides a tiger, and the coiling giant root resembles a crouching dragon."" Well, I wonder what extraordinary effect this had on audiences sitting in the dark and experience the story told by a director who, on the field of cinematic mastery, is not just a tiger and a dragon, but a butterfly who swings across the breeze with poetic lightness and gracious beauty, defying the wind like Lee did with cinematic conventions.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I don't know what the fuss is all about,"I had great expectations upon watching this film. After all, I waited a few years till the hype died down and finally watched it today on DVD.I was disappointed with it, frankly.It was no better than the usual martial arts fare. And of course the moves are contrived and very fake.No way can the sequences be better than the real classic, Bruce Lee v Chuck Norris way back in the 70s.I could understand the character's seeming lack of emotion and stiffness, and Zhang Zhiyi's incredible about-turn from ready-to-fight to ready-to-have-a-roll-in-the-shack, but apart from that, this is not a film I would recommend to anyone, less so watching it again.Ang Lee, you tried your best, but it wasn't up there.......",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Haven't I seen this before?,"While this is far from a bad movie, it is certainly one of the most over rated films of the last ten or fifteen years. I don't hate this movie, I just can't understand why this film was noticed when China and the rest of the Orient are turning out films equal to, if not better than this one.The story of pairs of lovers is interesting but its nothing that hasn't been told before and gave the film a strong sense of deja vu. I was marking off how many plot points in my head I got right while I watched the film and found I was pretty much right down the line.(A side note, this is based on, I think, the fourth book in a series so there are numerous references to events that happened earlier between characters. While this gives a sense of the characters being grounded it also is frustrating since there seems to be many times events in this film are echoing events in the past)If you've been watching Hong Kong films (or even Hollywood films over the past few years for that matter) you've seen the wire work that wowed many people when this film first came out. For many people the technical brilliance of something they have never been exposed to is the selling point. For me it was just been there done that.In the end I was left wondering if that was all there, and apparently it was.Despite my disappointment I suggest you try it. Just don't expect the bells and whistles.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
feminist Lee Ang,"Undoubtedly the martial scene in 'Crunching Tiger, Hidden dragon' is exquisite and excellent. While people are stunned by the gloriously choreographed kung-fu shot, unknowingly, the fine and smooth portrayal of characters is neglected, especially the strong feminism spirit appeared in almost every Lee's film. We can find the evidence easily from 'Crunching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.1. The background of story happened in the male-dominated wuxia group--WuuDang, whose kung-fu bequeath only transmitted to male student rather than female, no matter how brilliant the female student is. What Jade Fox opposed not only the male opponents, but the gender-discriminative martial group.2. Against the parental authority in traditional Chinese society, Lee chose Jen, daughter of an official bureaucrat, to steal the sword. Audience thought her behavior was childish, but she didn't do this just for 'fun'; she was striving the freedom she longing for a long time. What Lee tries to show is the liberation of women.3. To break the stereotype of emotional essence of women, Lee created a successful career woman, Shu-Lien, present in ancient martial society. Comparing to the reactionary and impulsive Li Mu-Bai, Shu-Lien was very liberal, sober and competent. She was also the model of Jen.Reviewing from 'Tui Shou', 'Hsi Yen', 'Yin Shi Nan Nu', 'Sense and Sensibility', 'The Ice Storm', 'Ride with the Devil' to 'Crunching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', gender is always the main issue that Lee wants to express. I would say that, those critiques mentioning that this is a shallow film must understand the implicit meaning Lee gave. Otherwise, they would get lost in the multifarious actions totally.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, hardly great.","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is probably one of the best films of 2000. I'm not sure if that says more about 2000 than it does about CTHD, but there is no doubt that Ang Lee is a master story teller, and that he certainly has a good story to tell.  The cinematography was wonderful, the music was elegant, and appropriate.  The acting was first class, the fight scenes were magical, and the theme was intriguing.  As an American viewer, I found the central plot to be universal, in that most cultures have traditions, and with these traditions, arise the conflicts between chasing ones dreams and respecting ones culture.  This theme is central enough to each of us, allowing most viewers to relate.That said, I think the flaw in this movie is the general ""hokiness.""  Many scenes (particularly the final scenes) were over-dramatized, and the plot sequence seemed to make the fight scenes convenient.  As an American viewer, I am used to the general ""hokiness"" of supermarket romance novels converted to film.  In some sense, this film is similar, at least that's the impression I had at times.  I'm not sure how this film was received in China, but from the various user comments I read, I would be safe in making the analogy CTHD:Chine::Titanic:America.A good film?  Yes.  A great film?  Hardly.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sumptuous aesthetics and an involving story,"I decided to rewatch this because I watched Patrick H. Willems' video about the film and why it's great. I also remembered Ang Lee's introduction to Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring on the Criterion Collection's release where he talked about the movie's great influence on him. As I watched the film again, I had things both said and some of my own Bergman thoughts floating around in my head. Willems talked about how Ang Lee characters are usually repressed and refuse to say what they mean (it was clear the second he said it), and Lee talked about how much of an influence Bergman was on his work. I was particularly thinking of my own observation that Bergman's characters often lie to each other and to themselves, and it fit rather well. The characters in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are often masking what they want from themselves and from the world around them.Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien are long time associates who both obviously love each other romantically, however they are separated by a societal convention that says that they cannot be together because Lien was engaged to Bai's brother who died decades before. Jen Yu is the daughter of a regional governor and betrothed to some bureaucrat, but she harbors memories of her weeks in the wilderness with an outlaw, Dark Cloud, and has kept secret her martial arts training with Jade Fox, a murderer hiding in Governor Yu's household as Jen's governess. Jen has another level to her deceptions in that her training with Jade Fox is based on a martial arts manual she stole from Li Mu Bai's order but couldn't read herself, which Jen did, only providing a cursory education to her own master.The element that ties all of these characters together is the Green Destiny, a magical sword that Li Mu Bai gives to Lien, assuring himself that he's leaving the life of a fighter behind after meditation took him to a place his master had not prepared him for. Jen, having grown up on stories of the fighters, in particular and specifically around both Bai and Lien themselves, is enamored with the sword and decided to simply steal it. That event ignites the adventure that follows.Now, to talk about the action. I adore the action in this film, and it's for several reasons. The first is how Lee films it. The action is largely filmed from afar, in wide shots, with more than enough room to see the performers going through the complex moves. Those shots are intercut with inserts of some closer action, but the action overall is driven by those long shots that allow the action to play out in clear terms for the audience, never trying to paper over poor performances with quick cuts. The other major reason is the use of wires. Now, I don't love wirework whenever it comes along, but I love it here. That has a lot to do with the overall tone of the film.Wirework in action implies something otherworldly. That can be explained through stuff like magic, but Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon takes it in a more interesting direction. There's an ethereal feeling to the whole affair that lends itself to the wirework in the action sequences. It's not like the movie ends up feeling like something else entirely when it switches from people talking to people swinging swords at each other. The talk around repressed emotions makes characters seem like they're never quite connected to the real world around them. They are inherently otherworldly in that way, so the flying fits how they interact with each other. These are people who are more concerned with larger ideals like the fathomless fear of reaching a place in meditation they hadn't expected, duty over passion, and questions of freedom against obligation.However, that's not to say that there are no baser concerns, they're just hidden below the surface. Bai wants to kill Jade Fox because she stole the martial arts manual but also for revenge. Lien and Bai keep coming together out of duty and because they love each other.Aside from the action, the movie is a sumptuous treat. From Bai and Jen standing on the top of bamboo trees to the simple, economical, and classic way scenes of people talking to each other to the beautiful colors of every scene, the movie is simply a joy to look at.Exciting, beautiful, touching, and intelligent, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a great film told with tenderness and verve all at once.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Stylized and Artistic,"This award-winning film from Ang Lee was nominated for ten Oscars and won four (Best Cinematography, Best Music, Original Score, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, and Best Foreign Language Film). I don't even pretend to know what's in the heads of Academy Award voters, but I'd say that this movie deserved all four Oscars. The set and scenery were stunning. The music was always the right tempo, pitch, and mood. This movie was truly artistic. Even the dialogue, untranslated, sounded poetic and meaningful.The principle characters in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" were Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh). Both were highly trained fighters and both were in love with each other, but it was a love that they would never express or commit to out of deference for Shu's fallen betrothed who was a friend to Li Mu Bai. A conflict arose when a gifted sword known as Green Destiny was stolen by a young female warrior named Jen (Ziyi Zhang). Getting the sword back from her wasn't that big of an issue, but dispatching her teacher Jade Fox (Pei-Pei Cheng) was.The fighting that occurred in this film was very stylized and fantastical as the fighters leaped great distances with ease, pirouetted from rooftop to rooftop, danced on trees, and skipped across water. But the true story lied in lost loves. Lost loves due to a sense of duty, a sense of social standing, or a sense of betrayal. The movie is based upon the book of the same title written by Du Lu Wang. I'm sure the book was much better than the movie because there are some details that are missing that I would think were made clear in the book. This movie was a breakout film for Ang Lee and for good reason. If only he didn't have to make ""Hulk.""",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Quality, tasteful, restrained film-making.","'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' certainly exudes 'quality' beauty, from the miraculous recreation (or has the country simply not changed?) of turn of the century China, and the relentlessly symmetrical compositions, the immovable grid against which the characters struggle to express their humanity, to the expansive Tan Dun score, which matches Hollywood in scope, but manages to avoid sentimentality and overly crass commericalism, probably through the melancholy Yo-Yo Ma cello solos which give this film its distinctively downbeat atmosphere, unusual for any kind of action movie, never mind the usually exuberant martial arts genre.This is in keeping with what we expect from Ang Lee - these aren't carefree heroes he gives us, but weary warriors, disenchanted with the false mythology that has grown around their caste, paralysed by emotional repression imposed by stern codes that seem increasingly irrelevant or inadequate.  In this, it is like 'Gladiator', and it shares with that 'film' an overall sombre stateliness with frenetic spurts of action.Of course, this is only a superficial comparison - whereas 'Gladiator' was a glorified computer game, 'Crouching' reeks with authenticity, a sympathy with and understanding of Chinese culture (society, rites, philosophies etc.), of human nature, of the influence of culture on human nature, the impact of tradition; everything 'Gladiator' revealed about Roman society and culture could have been gleaned from a Steve Reeves outtake.This is what gives the film, which has a surprisingly simple plot, considering the genre, its satisfying depth and texture - one never feels that it is simply generic.  But this is also the film's flaw (besides the fact that I'm not really into solemn stateliness), one that it shares with Lee's last film, 'Ride With the Devil', which was another attempt to humanise, de-cliche an action genre, the Western, and which succeeded so well that one sometimes wondered where the entertainment had gone to.Don't get me wrong, 'Crouching' is very entertaining.  The action scenes are simply magical.  One of the cliches about a certain kind of action cinema is that it is balletic.  For instance, Sam Peckinpah.  But in Peckinpah's films, the action itself is not balletic, just men standing around shooting each other; it is the rhythm created by montage and composition that creates this feeling of dance.'Crouching' is truly balletic, or dance-like; the exhilirating physical verve within a set of precise, expressive movements gives the film the same sense of controlled improvisation as a Gene Kelly routine.  These aren't just fights, but rigorously timed dances, each contrary move complementing or developing the previous, so that the potential chaos of the content - fighting, flying, fleeing etc. - is beautifully harmonised by the form, as you would expect from Lee.The camera is as liberated and controlled as the warriors; in one astonishing scene it follows a falling victim of Jen Yu down the top of a restaurant to the ground floor and continues to record the action with fleet energy, giving it an  almost supernatural, non-physical power.As Li Mu Bai says, there is no desire without restraint.  But sometimes there's a little too much restraint.  Sometimes you just want to escape the suffocating honorability of Li and Yu, and revel in the tyro delirium of Jen, whose undisciplined energy is a constant, sensual joy, one sequence as beserk as a brawl in a Western.  You know with Lee you will never trespass the bounds of taste, never reach the obscure, psychedelic audacity of 'A Touch of Zen', or the sheer silliness of 'The Dead and the Deadly', where the hero is turned into a slug.Sometimes, such as the astonishing airborne fight in the bamboo trees, or the 'Fantomas'-like plot involving a masked stranger and a villainess called Jade Fox (the film is fundamentally conservative, and yet sympathetic to its lesbian-feminist transgressor), or the 'Winchester 73'-like abstracting of the plot by having a weapon as the film's true hero, or the remarkable extended flashback sequence where Jen meets the barbarian Lo, you wish that Lee might push it a little further, might leave tastefulness behind just for a moment and do something daft.  But he always pulls back, as his story and characters demand.  For better and worse, this is exactly the kind of martial arts movie you would expect the director of 'Sense and Sensibility' to make.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very majestic movie,"Excellent movie that mixes martial arts and fantasy. The movie is lead by Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi. The sword fight between Yeoh and Zhang's characters is an amazing fight scene, definitely one of the best in a martial arts film involving only female actors. It was one of the first movies produced in Asia to be both a box office hit and a critical success at the same time. With the great visuals and cinematography it's one of the most beautiful movies on film IMO. The action doesn't lack in it's own regard either with the stunt team from The Matrix movies involved with this film. The movie was shot in Mandarin but even with having to read subtitles the movie is still very easy to follow.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Over-rated,"I can't believe how highly this movie has been rated.  For me it was little more than a martial arts melodrama and often quite silly.

Suspension Of Reality,"There are two types of people who walk away from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" : those who think the concept of a human being having the ability to defy gravity and accomplish impossible physical tasks is ridiculous ; and those that are able to allow the movie to tell a beautiful fantasy epic by engaging in the concept of suspension of reality.The quicker you allow ""Crouching Tiger..."" take over your mindset and send you on its amazing journey, the quicker you will enjoy the awesome power of this film. The martial arts scenes here are simply amazing. For all of the tight, quick movements that are displayed by the characters, this movie never once seems choreographed - not once. It is that good.But there is even so much more to ""Crouching Tiger..."" than the martial arts scenes. The gorgeous landscapes are the perfect compliment to this epic tale. They show the depth of the great story and journey being told, without becoming the centerpiece of the film.That is because the true centerpiece of this film is Chinese culture. It is Chinese culture that calls for those anti-gravity fight scenes. It is Chinese culture that is depicted in the village scenes. It is Chinese culture that is shown in the landscapes. Most of all, it is Chinese culture that is heard through the mouths of the actors when they speak their lines.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Comments are More Interesting Than the Film,"I am enjoying the comments from other users -- so much, in fact, that they are keeping my attention more than the film.  Let me start by saying that I have seen numerous foreign language film and this one falls short of the Asian titles ""To Live"" or ""King of Masks.""  I found the fighting scenes to be both laughable and fun to watch at first.  However, after the third sequence, I was ready for the film to end.Take away the effects, and you end up with a mediocre love-story.6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A wonderful film,"Ann Lee is a real master!A fantastic movie with a great cast including Michell Yoeh, a particular favourite of mine who compels with not only her good looks but her incredible martial arts skills have a fluidity that is akin to dancing. In this film Yun-Fat Chow is in his first action role as Li Mu Bai and is utterly believable, moving with a calm self-assurance you would normally expect from a seasoned action star. They portray a pair of lovers who can never be together with this tension oozing out from every scene they share together: The uncomfortable dialogue coupled with knowing, loving glances and stolen touches. This is acting of the highest calibre and surely has to rank as each of these actors' best on screen performance.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Interesting but overrated...,"An odd film, this: so highly placed in the IMDB Top 250 yet so many negative user comments! I guess you'll either love it or hate it and so the only point in writing anything about it is to help you decide which camp you're going to fall into.So, on the positive side, most of the martial arts scenes are definitely cool, in an exaggerated matrix-like way. There are plenty of nice touches scattered throughout the rest of the story as well. Without giving anything away, I particularly like the scene where Su Lien demonstrates that she knows who the thief is. The acting of the principals is good. If you're going to see one Chinese movie this year, it might as well be this one.But on the downside, I can't help wondering how well this movie would have fared if it didn't have the foreign movie mystique. The plot is at times confusing. The intent seems to be to not waste any time on introductions and so catapult the viewer directly into the story, but it's easy to miss things the first time round. The story is also very fragmented and jumps around from place to place without much obvious connection.  Despite this, it also feels very slow. People seem to be willing to forgive these faults in this movie for some reason, though they might pan a domestic movie for the same things.But probably the worst bits for me are the ubiquitous wire effects. Some people go on about the effortless way in which the main characters seem to float through the landscape. But for me, the main characters are so obviously swinging around on the ends of cables that it completely destroys any feeling of immersion. These effects are almost a parody of bad filmmaking and every time I saw Li Mu Bai being dangled awkwardly over the rooftops, it wrenched me out of the fantasy experience and reminded me that I was watching a movie.In summary, a flawed classic. Very different from your average Hollywood production, though that in itself does not make a great movie! Some decent martial arts scenes and some good moments. But ultimately too fragmented and slow to live up to its overhyped reputation.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Emperor's New Clothes,"Why have people gone overboard about this film? It's not awful, but it is far from great. The fight scenes are okay, but mostly take place in the dark. The flying sequences are farcical. The plot makes Star Wars look like Tolstoy. The story is too uneven to either be an ensemble piece or to focus on one character. Many of the characters key to the plot are not even seen. There are some great sequences, but I've seen better episodes of the 80s TV classic Monkey. I have thoroughly enjoyed Lee's work in the past - Ice Storm, East Drink Man Woman - but this is not his greatest. It did not deserve a nomination, let alone a win at the Globes. My only theory is that the normal Ang Lee crowd who went to see this have never seen a decent action movie, and so have nothing to compare it with.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Okay, now let's all take a deep breath and relax","After reading reviews about this film and seeing comments on TV and so on, you would think that this was not only the best film in the world but the most unique film you will ever see.RELAX!I went into this film expecting to be blown away and maybe, just maybe that was my problem, but people please, come on!  This was a fun film.  It was intriguing and it was well choreographed but the best film of the year?  You have got to be kidding me.  Jackie Chan films are like this and so were all the after school-channel-twenty-chop-socki shows that I watched when I was a kid.  I think I have a hard time understanding the discrimination between what is art and what is fun...because this is fun to me, nothing more.Perhaps this film gets some of its praise because it is directed by Ang Lee. He has made some other films that critics have drooled over that were actually just okay films.  See The Ice Storm and Sense and Sensibility, they were critical darlings but just average films.  I am not saying that this is a bad film, quite the contrary.  But it is not in the same realm as Traffic and Gladiator as best films of the year.What is to like about the film is the martial arts.  I love watching that one warrior that has been trained better than any other who just seems to be invincible.  Here, that is Chow Yun Fat.  He is one of the last of a dying breed of warrior that gets his training from an ancient religion.  You have to go to a mountain to receive this training and it takes all of your life to master it.  You are then something like a Jedi once you have mastered this.  Of course there are those out there that are vengeful and they want to steal the secrets and swords and such and this launches the journey that the movie takes us on.  The journey is to recover a stolen sword.There is nothing wrong with this film.  As a matter a fact, I like it very much.  But it bothers me when judgments are clouded by films like this this one and yet a similar film can be passed off as fluff or entertainment.  Why the prejudism?  Why is one film better than another?So my advice is simple.  Go to this film, see it and enjoy, but please don't be looking for another Gone With The Wind.  That is the critics job to tell you that.  But be your own judge.8 out of 10- a great film and fun to watch, but don't believe the hype!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Real Best Picture of 2000,"To the skeptics: this is not just another cheesy martial arts movie where testosterone rules above all else. In fact the most impassioned characters in the film are the women, Shu Lien(Michelle Yeoh) and Jen(Zhang Ziyi). The sword fight between the them is one of the film's great set pieces. Although the fight scenes are stunning, ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" also contains beautiful music, breathtaking photography and moments of gentle, melancholic romanticism. I think particularly of the scenes between Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh; it isn't often that unspoken love is so perfectly depicted(watch the moment where he presses her hand to his cheek- that may just be the best part in the whole film). And this movie lost the Oscar to ""Gladiator""-- The injustice of it burns.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A beautiful film that transcends its genre,"I am not a great fan of Wuxia, in fact it bores me stiff to the point. Where I'd rather watch paint dry than the posturing heroes showing off.

However,a friend was adament that I should watch this and I am glad that she was so persistent.Ang Lee has put together excellent actors, beautiful ci9nematography and his directorial skills to create a work of artistic greatness for which the Wuxia is only a framework to wrap a story around. He has taken an eye for mind wowingly beautiful camera shots and added a story that twangs the heart strings. Then he reassesed the fight scenes, necessary in any martial arts film, and choreographed them into beautiful dance scenes while retaining them as believable fight moves.A true work of genius that should satisfy the martial arts nuts, but is something so much greater.

Ang Lee's Fable is Powerful in Both a Physical and a Philosophical Sense,"Mythic, romantic kung-fu that functions under its own peculiar set of rules. Like a storybook, Crouching Tiger is more invested in a sense of poetic philosophy than the concrete laws of physical reality. Hence, gravity is treated as little more than a passing concern and we're released to enjoy a string of smooth, balletic airborne action scenes. Needless to say, they're all fantastic. Each one a unique member of the family, having swapped weaponry, dance partners and scenery from a wide pool of spectacular options. Hard-hitting but precise, it's a stunning display of form, strategy and blink-of-the-eye counter strikes, with the occasional dance across a serene lake thrown in to cut the tension.The underlying story is rich and meaningful, too, though it is guilty of suddenly filling in a whole lot of back-story in one long, jolting flashback scene that chews up most of the second act. It's about hidden passions, personal guilt, the conflict between what looks right and what feels right... plus a lost comb and a stolen sword. Even undisputed masters on the battlefield must deal with private regrets after they've thrown the final blow.A resonant Eastern epic that's chock full of memorable scenes, well-crafted characters, gorgeous locations and risky personal conflicts.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It just never grabbed my attention,"Sometimes it seems like I have a sixth sense in regards to the movies I will and won't enjoy. Case in point: movies like ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", that I have known about for years, and intended to watch for the same length of time.I have wanted to watch ""Crouching Tiger"" since it came out. That's more than twenty years. What took me so long? I think that's where the sixth sense comes in. Perhaps I always knew on some level I wasn't going to enjoy it, which is what kept me away. But how could I possibly have known that?I'm like the Nostradamus of film.Anyway, a review (of sorts):I don't really know what this movie was about. It only got my attention maybe once in its entire length. I read online that it was something about people stealing swords. The only bit I paid attention to was when the beautiful Zhang Ziyi was living with some bandit guy and kept attacking him and spitting on him. That got my attention, maybe because it was smaller in scale than the rest of the movie, so it was easier to focus on it. I don't know.What was the deal with all the people flying through the air in this movie? There's some wonky wire-fu in Shaw Bros. Flicks but I don't remember the people ever defying gravity like a superhero. I never got used to the sight of people flying. It looked weird, like a special effect in a Jean Cocteau movie.I also didn't enjoy any of the action sequences. It's pretty much all sword fighting, not kung-fu. Maybe I just don't like sword-fighting scenes in movies. The scenes with that in ""A Touch of Zen"" didn't interest me either.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Dont listen to the hype, there are many other movies that have much better fight scenes, personally, i'd rather watch a Jackie Chan movie than sit through Crouching Tiger again (and I saw the original subtitled version).This is just not that great a movie, and I just cant see why so many people think it is!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A rich , enjoyable and romantic take on the Chinese Martial Arts genre with inventive choreography","¨Crouching tiger , hidden dragon¨ belongs to ¨Wusia¨ theme , China's heroic swordsman subgenre , it regards two veteran Wudan fighters (Chow Yun-Fat as Master Li Mu Bai and Michelle Yeoh as Yu Shu Lien) in 19th-century China recognize their passion for each other while tracking down a vengeful master criminal (Pei Pei) and her protege (exciting Ziyi) . Dealing with a deadly confrontation and a martial arts love story that satisfies on both accounts . Meantime a young Chinese warrior robs a sword from a famed swordsman and then escapes into a world of romantic adventure with a mysterious young (Chang Chen) in the frontier of the nation. All of them clash over the Green Destiny , a priceless sword stealen as a mark of defiance .Ang Lee imbues every look , every gesture with grace and resonance , he has always been a filmmaker of finesse and fine feeling directing competently this adaptation , but his touch is just as deft even as he extends his grasp to show the timeless Chinese legends , being based on the book by Wang Du Lu, fourth entry in ¨Iron Pentatology¨ written in 1931 . The first fifteen minutes offer dense exposition , introducing the legendary and righteous swordsman Li Mu Bai , his steemed partner Yu Shu Lien and the wilful young aristocrat Jen who enjoys a double life as a thief under the malign tutelage of her governess . This is an immortal story of strength, secrets, and concerning two warriors who would never surrender . Action , adventure , romance , drama , heroes , heroines, tradition and martial arts blend in this classic movie that belongs to Oriental cinema. The emotional impact of the romance is as real and true as the choreographed figh scenes are grateful and spectacular . The movie's overt feminism flies literally in the face of its patriarchal setting , yet doesn't seem a bit out of place . The magnificent battle scenes were choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping who performed the same duties for ¨Brothers Wachowski's Matrix¨ and ¨Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill¨. Providing gorgeous chases in brilliantly modulated set pieces across the roof-tops , while defying the gravity in exhilarating leaps and bounds . Once it takes flight the film never touches the ground , spinning myriad duels of the body and spirit ; only relaxing to stage the demolition of a tavern with slapstick and ironical aplomb . Stars a stunning cast with notorious Chinese actors , such as : Chow Yun-Fat , Michelle Yeoh , Ziyi Zhang and Chang Chen . Most of them performed their own stunts, only CGI was used to remove the wires holding them up. A great and successful movie which was a complete hit on western screens ; resulting to be the only martial arts film to date to be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture . Being winner of 4 Academy awards : Foreign film, photography : Peter Pau , artistic direction, musical score : Tan Dun and two Golden Globes: Foreign film and Direction.This sexy and sublime motion picture was compellingly directed by eclectic filmmaker Ang Lee (Brokeback mountain , Sense and Sensibility , Hulk , Ride with the devil) providing overwhelming images , impressive production design , sense of style and revealing the breathtaking vistas of mythic China . Rating : 7.5/10 . Essential and indispensable watching , it's a feast for the senses and 100 per cent sheer cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Mythical Epic Brought To Life,"Jaw-dropping martial arts combined with a genuinely good story  `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' delivers this nice blend, making for one of the best action movies  indeed, one of the best movies, period  made in the past few years.  Forget any possible negative preconceived notions that you might have about subtitled films, or about martial arts films, because `Crouching Tiger' is a flat-out great movie.`Crouching Tiger' is told in a fable-like manner, or a tale about the Knights of the Round Table  it's fairly simple, but very engaging.  The warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat), a near-legendary hero, abruptly retires, giving his sword  the Green Destiny  over to the wise Sir Te (Pei-pei Cheng) for safekeeping.  Li Mu Bai has tired of the warrior's life, and wishes to begin pursing a future with the unrequited love of his life, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh).  Before he can confess his love to Yu Shu Lien, though, the Green Destiny is stolen  at first, it is thought that Li Mu Bai's sworn enemy, the Jade Fox (Li Fazeng) has stolen the weapon, but it becomes readily apparent that a new, impetuous young warrior has stolen the weapon instead . . . the troubled daughter of a powerful, noble family, a girl named Jen (Zhang Ziyi.)   Woven in and out of the pursuit of the Green Destiny is romance, comedy, and some of the best wire-assisted martial arts work ever caught on film. For the most part, the wire-work martial arts is used in much the same way as digital effects were used in `Forrest Gump'  to enhance the story, not to be the story.  It adds nicely to the mythical, fairy-tale tone of the film  only towards the end of the movie does the effect start becoming unbelievable and obtrusive.  The choreographed fights are like Fred Astaire dance numbers, fluid, fast, and unbelievable to watch.  Both Michelle Yeoh and newcomer Zhang Ziyi are poetry in motion.  The look of the film is fantastic as well  with sweeping desert plains, the forests, the cities, director Ang Lee created an epic backdrop for `Crouching Tiger' that helps make the film an event as well as a story.Speaking of story, `Crouching Tiger' is a well-told tale, albeit a simple one.  Part of its charm is the simple backstory, which is hinted at but never explored.  It's casually mentioned, for example, that the old and wise Sir Te was once one of the greatest warriors in the kingdom  but it's left at that; it's enough to add depth to the story without beating the audience over the head with it.  The story moves along at a quick, exciting pace, except for one sequence regarding Jen that's awkwardly dropped into the middle of the film.  Well-paced and well thought out, `Crouching Tiger' is one of the best-told tales to be caught on film in quite a while.Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat are excellent in this film (although I kept expecting Chow Yun-Fat to pull out a pair of nine-millimeter handguns and start blasting away at villains.)  Without question, though, Zhang Ziyi steals the movie as Jen  not only is she an astonishingly good martial artist, but she is undeniably a terrific actress as well.  She runs a gamut of emotions throughout `Crouching Tiger', flying between joyful elation to quiet sadness to screaming rage  her performance is nothing short of outstanding.  With any luck, Zhang Ziyi should someday become a top marquee name; she's that good.`Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' isn't a perfect film . . . but it comes darn close.

"Good, but not that good.","Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a good film, but it's not a great one. It's not as great as everyone says it is. Oh, it's definitely beautiful in every sense of the word. It's wonderfully choreographed. It's skillfully directed, and all of the acting talents ARE talented, and they depict their characters with depth, grace, and sometimes when necessary, wit.But its handsome qualities can't hide its meandering, sometimes tedious storyline, although the storyline itself isn't the problem. Take into account the execution. Take out the dance-number action sequences, and what have you got? A bratty girl who wants to rebel and gets people killed as a result of her reckless actions and poor judge of character. Her motivations are indeed valid, but her actions are childish and grating, and not always justifiable as a 'means to an end' sort of thing. I'm glad Ang Lee didn't depict her actions as such, but she was still an obnoxious character whose lack of responsibility is almost rewarded with secrecy by people who are trying to help her despite how often she backhands them with her attitude.I found the story underwhelming, to put it simply. The only other flaw I can think of is the dialogue, at least in the English-subtitled version (I haven't seen the dub, and don't plan to), where character traits and motivations are often explained to us in dull exposition sequences that could have been shortened or even cut out completely in favour of showing us their motivations through their actions. A skilled director can show his audience what his characters are thinking and feeling without telling them through stinted lines of dialogue, and I think Ang Lee is skilled enough to do it--he just didn't want to, I guess.Anyway, despite my gripes, I think Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is still a well-told film with a kind of beauty and grace that few others can match, visually and aesthetically. Wuxia isn't a genre I'm big on, but I can't say I've any feelings against it outright. I appreciate its capacity for amazing visuals and thematic symbolism, but it's a fickle style. Lee did an amazing job, and despite the hype surrounding this film, and the underwhelming execution of the story, I was not disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I believe if I was closer to the chinese culture I would have loved this movie, maybe even ignore the outrageously stupid and totally illogical special effects. If that is not a problem for you it will be much easier to watch it, for me personally it was way too much nonsense.

Beautiful,"There isn't actually much to say, I think the movie is great. The fight scenes are incredible, just gorgeous, spectacular, and fun. The movie is visually astonishing and impactful, with a great cinematography. The acting is really good, and of course, I think the stunts here are so good, some of the scenes (like the fight over the trees) I was like ""wait... how?"" lol, just awesome.And well, I think the story is pretty cool, I like the whole warrior mythology they build, with Li Mu Bai, Shu Lien and Jen Yu mostly, even tho they don't explore it that much, and focus the most attention to Jen's storyline, and also Lien and Bai's romantical tension, the world behind them feels real, and that makes a huge difference.Probably the only thing I didn't like as much was the whole 20+ minutes flashback, out of nowhere to tell Jen and Luo's story or something, idk man, like, sure, I don't actually know how they could have told that differently, and I get that it gave their relationship the background they sort of needed, but the whole comb stuff, feels like such a stupid reason for her to go after him, and they honestly never explained why that was so important. ""You wouldn't understand"", like... why? Try me. It felt sort of a lazy way out, and that whole sequence imo dragged the movie's pace towards the middle significantly.Still tho, the movie is great, the story is engaging for most of it, the fight scenes (and there are a lot of them) are super well made, with amazing stunt work, and highly entertaining.

A beautiful hodgepodge,"I have to disclaim this review by first explaining that it would not originally have been my choice of movies to go see. I don't usually pick Chinese Martial Arts movies out of a crowd. However, I'd heard from so many people how amazing it is, so I decided to see for myself.My opinion is mixed. The best parts of the movie are the visuals and special effects. The fight scenes are beautifully choreographed, resembling artistic dancing. The fantasy sequences of people flying and standing on treetops are especially breathtaking, as is the scenery and cinematography.The acting was also fairly good, with performances by Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh, among others. The only really noteworthy performance, in my opinion, was given by Zhang Ziyi as Jen, the confused daughter of the Governor. She came across as convincing in portraying a mix of naiveté, confusion, wistfulness, and prodigious talent, all hidden between a hostile exterior.Where the movie falls apart is with the plot. I found that it lacked direction, seeming to travel haphazardly in one direction and then another. Ask any writer or English teacher what makes a good story, and they'll reply that it has to have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Seems simple, right? Well, that basic principle got lost somewhere along the way with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.Characters change their missions almost by the minute. Flashbacks occur at odd times. The love stories seem to be thrown in simply to appeal to a Hollywood audience, without any real need for them in the plot. The result is somewhat of a hodgepodge.Of course, it's a beautiful hodgepodge to watch. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is worth seeing in theatres simply for the visuals. The bigger the screen, the better. It doesn't quite translate to DVD with quite the same effect.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Most overrated movie of the last 400,000 years","Excruciatingly boring slice of middlebrow chop-socky from AngLee, a director who has become the Marcus Welby of contemporary cinema--his work consists of a series of fatherlynods and pats on the hand.

Ziyi Zhang is the key to this film,"Few films can offer so much all at the same time.Directon by Lee, possibly his best-known (and most appreciated) work.Outstanding cinematography and wire-based Wu Shu scenes.Great script -- full of intrigue, romance, compassion.But the essence of this ""man's"" film is ironically the women in it. Michelle Yeoh has never been as cool and exotic and under-stated as she is here.And Ziyi Zhang owns this film. Exhibiting an audacious personality that far outweighs her pixie-ish form, she is the focal point for the viewer. Loving and fighting and sobbing and plotting her way through the script, never letting the viewer get tired or lose interest.This was a great film in 2000. It is an even greater film in 2016 after the wretched sequel which offers none of the magic or the charm or the polish of the original.You may or may not find the ending a bit melodramatic.

Masterful Epic by One of the Great Directors,"It seems like every day, there is another report about how China is passing the US in terms of pure box office numbers. This often concerns me. Not because I'm xenophobic or even because I am just patriotic and want my country to be the best in everything. But because the Chinese tastes in my opinion are a bit... underdeveloped. Say what you want about the tastes of the U.S., but at least we only spent a bit less than 250 million on the (shudder) 4th Transformers movie (or Trans4mers, if you prefer) instead of letting it become the highest grossing film in our country to that point, as did the Chinese.Their tendency to devour trash, both exotic and local, is troubling. I am worried. ...And I would be a lot less worried if China offered up a film this good at least once every year.You could argue that this is not entirely a Chinese film, but that would open up a whole other can of worms that I don't want to touch as of no. So instead, I will go into this film.Calling from both the future and the past, using techniques both old and new, this film creates a mystical, almost knowingly surreal environment, then fills it with all sorts of action and story. I would put this film on the list of those that you don't watch as much as experience, which is always a good place to be.Refreshingly, the protagonist and a majority of the main cast is female, a rarity in films from the West and (perhaps particularly) the East. That in itself is interesting, offering different dynamics and points of view than could be done with the traditional Enter the Dragon sort of martial arts film.Going further, one could almost think that the 'different dynamics and points of view' thing is almost this film's M.O. In a lot of ways, it deconstructs and reconstructs a lot of martial arts tropes. There is never a doubt that this is through and through a wuxia film. But it does not stop and take pictures at each of the typical tropes. It weaves through them with style and grace to create something special, something that is the clear work of a true artist. It is as if someone took the pieces in a tiger puzzle and used them to create a dragon.There are many lenses through which you can look at this film. Artistic. Historical. Poetic. Symbolic. Even philosophical. But no matter which you choose, you cannot deny that this film is a masterpiece. It does not content itself with the easy or the simple or the standard. It goes all out, as if seeing the horizon of greatness and blazing its own path through it.Perhaps what I find most fascinating about this film is how it refuses to stay within the realms of reality. Many martial arts movie prefer to stay grounded even as their mains perform superhuman feats. Not this one. This one is entrenched more in the art and heart of a fable or legend than any corner of reality. Take the jumps for instance. Most movies, though their characters jump ridiculously long distances, at least make it look like they are actually jumping. But this film makes it clear that they are gliding through the airs of their world, unbounded by the forces of gravity. And the film is better for it.From a subjective standpoint, I love that the movie is Eastern from surface to core. This is a fully fledged representation of the culture of a nation. If China had to pick one film to represent itself, I think it should be this one. (If you're wondering which one I would choose for America, it would be The Godfather.) Like Ang Lee's other masterpiece, The Life of Pi, this film immerses you in its culture, in its stylings, wearing them proudly.This film is stunning; a must-watch. The soundtrack is ethereal and dynamic. The cinematography is unique and top class.The story is deep, carrying much gravitas. The acting is solid and assured. The tone is dark yet artistic and hopeful.My favorite sequence in the film is a flashback sequence to the desert. I won't spoil what it's about narratively, but it is stylistically stunning. Tonally, it is presented the way a flashback should be presented but almost never ends. It seems like some sort of warped daydream; real yet almost unbelievable and captivating for it. Spiral steadily on and on it does. Fifteen minutes pass. Twenty. You keep waiting for it to be over. But it isn't yet. And for that you are glad. It comforts the highest reaches of your mind and senses. And it is this movie in a nutshell.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Unique Achivement,"For me, it's as beautiful, dramatically compelling, and philosophically interesting as any movie I can recall. Kurosawa, Powell & Pressburger, and Nick Ray would all laud this entertaining genre movie that Ang Lee elevates to the realm of sublime art.It's also an extraordinarily canny distillation of Eastern wuxia and Western arthouse aesthetics; it was one of the earlier attempts at this in the globalization era and still may be the best of them.As we struggle our way through another rough century, we'd be wise to observe and strive toward Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon's boundless grace.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Wow!,"Maybe this motion picture is the best movie ever-made (Well, this is not, The lord of the Rings is better).I liked a lot ""crouching tiger, hidden dragon"" because it is not typical martial arts movie only with spectacular fights, since the movie shows another qualities from Chinese culture as philosophy. The motion picture shows the talent from Ang Lee before he would make ""brokeback mountain"".The movie is a banquet with spectacular fights accompanied of a beautiful love story. these fights were planned carefully, and it looks like a mortal dance. The best of the movie is the character played by Zhang Ziyi. She offers a master acting. She has talent and beauty in order to be a great actress. Simply gorgeous!

Excellently executed escapist fantasy,"I'm not at all familiar with the sub genre of Chinese storytelling that this film is associated with/belongs to, so for all I know it might be a very poor example from an area of entertainment with a lot more to offer. But if that's true, then this is a truly stellar genre, as I adore this film!Yes, it's slow-burning. Yes, the plot could be taken on the surface as paper thin. But this is cinematic escapism at it's very best. It makes me cringe when people criticise the film because the fight scenes are ridiculously unrealistic. Some people just don't get it. It helps to think of the battles as dances, balletic visual poetry (indeed Michelle Yeoh's background is in dance, not martial arts). ""Crouching Tiger"" contains some of the most equisite set pieces I've seen on film -the first fight scene between the two female leads, the bar brawl, and the lyrical final scene in the mountain- come immediately to mind. However, I found the treetop chase to be lacking somewhat in execution- it's a concept with good potential, but it translates clumsily onto screen.The visual genius on display is supported by a beautifully subtle performance from Michelle Yeoh, contrasted by the starkly vital presence of Zhang Zi (I know I've spelt that wrong, oh well :S). They both eat up the screen with their charisma- you genuinely cannot take your eyes away from them. Yeoh is all slight quivers beneath deliberate control, eyes fixed in enigmatic amusement, potential tears always seeming only a moment away. Zi uses her incredible, manga-like eyes to convey likeable innocence when she playing at being the aristocrat, mischief when she is quipping like the all-American action heros so popular in the films made the other side of the Pacific, and an incredible anger when in the fight scenes. Zi is supported excellently by her eminently likeable, equally charismatic love interest, the ragged desert-dwelling thief. However Yeoh is, unfortunately, not matched by her male counterpart Chow Yun Fat, who turns in an oddly dispassionate, uninvolving performance. However, it's possible that he was good in the film, but the sizeable talent surrounding him merely suffocated any possibility of him coming across as anything more than mediocre.And now onto the plot- often accused of being far too simple and ""high-concept"" for such a critically acclaimed film. I would disagree. Certainly, this isn't an exercise in senseless ""the-plot-rules-all"" film making promoted by many a summer movie. The plot not only serves the characters, but IS the characters, their interactions and relationships. The restrained dynamic between Yun Fat and Yeoh is played against the sparky, lusty affair between Zi the aristo and her lowly bit of criminal scruff (the latter being standard escapist, fairy tale fluff, executed perfectly). The final scene between Yeoh and Yun Fat's characters is infinitely more interesting than lesser film makers would make it, as there is no tragic final kiss, merely tears and regret. Perhaps the most interesting character dynamic is between the aging female outlaw Jade Fox, and her supposed muse, Zi.The rave reviews this film recieved seems to have led to a lot of bitterness from viewers who were dissapointed by it. If you are accustomed to frenetically edited and paced action movies (and don't get me wrong, I love those movies when they're well done), or bone crunchingly realistic/gory fight scenes, this may not be for you. The film is often ponderous, concentrating on the characters and/or lush scenery as opposed to plot twists on every page. The fight scenes aren't about violence, but the beauty of two bodies communicating, an acrobatic, high speed dance of wills.All in all: great performances, great cinematography, great direction, great scenery, great ending, great music, great set pieces, great characters. Great film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Above Average with Some Great Moments - Huge Opportunity Missed,"As a child I loved to watch martial arts films (particularly Bruce Lee films).  As I got older my tastes changed and the ""silliness/campiness"" of some of these films became more and more apparent. However, part of me was still looking for a film which would not only resurrect my youthful thrill of martial arts but would also encompass an equally engaging story.  From all the hype that CTHD had generated I thought that this could possibly be it.I would have loved this film back in 1973 but for all the wrong reasons. Today however it felt like a better than average film with some incredible martial arts scenes.  I enjoyed the dreamlike feeling that let you become part of a world where flying, tree climbing,  roof top warriors existed and where honor and dignity were virtues we could all believe in once again. However the quality that all great films must have comes down to a great story and equally great performances.  Around all the visual beauty and martial arts mastery the overall story of CTHD was .. well..  just OK. That's the biggest shame of this film.  It missed this key ingredient and unfortunately ends up being a forgettable film.The performances were generally very good (especially for this genre) yet no amount of acting can elevate a mediocre story to greatness.  This is a movie that I would have loved to love and the fact that it missed the one ingredient that could have made it a real true classic is the biggest shame of all!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon,"The only reason why this movie can be awarded a 9 is because it is a link between two cultures of movie making. It allowed for the Chinese culture to penetrate the Hollywood and even the international movie scene. Not true, some may say, but ask the commercial viewers which Chinese movie they have seen and it will be this one. they will tell you they did not like it, but i think it is perfect. It has allowed for cinematography (Chinese) to flourish, merely because they has a Hollywood budget. It is a mix between the west and the east (old Chinese customs and traditions) in a western suit. Anyone who thinks that they will enjoy a Chinese movie, but think that movies such as the fighting munk or the terrible dragon (i am unsure of the titles) then will enjoy this flic. Hopefully as many people will appreciate the movie as we have. Take care, treat life well and watch this F---ing movie please...",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful film!,"An absolutely beautifully orchestrated film. From the music to the carefully planned fight sequences, this film is a fantastic addition to the amazing martial art books. I'm not usually one for the subtitled films, but subtitles are not needed to watch this.The body language and expressions of the characters tell a story all on their own, captivating audiences within action driven orientated scenes. Martial art films are not really my favourite choice of film, mainly due to the continuous fighting scenes, which although very cleverly planned, get slightly repetitive. However, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon has an interesting, evocative narrative that brings you into the individual character's experiences and lives, rather than just continuously viewing none stop kung fu etc.If you want a romantic, adventure flick with a beautiful soundtrack and depth then this film is a must see!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's all about interactions,"According to the hype around Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, its creators have produced a miracle: a martial arts crossover hit, simultaneously a substantial foreign language drama for discerning art house audiences and the greatest martial arts movie of all time. Although Crouching Tiger falls short of such (probably unattainable) perfection, it is enormously fun, and manages to be one of the more interesting films of recent years. Though nominally set in the Qing dynasty, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is loosely based in a Chinese martial arts movie tradition that pits outlaws against heroes in a timeless ""long ago"" analogous to the American cinematic Old West. As the film opens, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat), the greatest swordsman in China and famed disciple of the Wudan martial arts system, has realized that the years spent fighting outlaws and striving for enlightenment have left him lonely and unhappy. He is on the verge of renouncing his life as a warrior to try to find happiness with his beloved friend and former comrade-in-arms Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh). As the film opens, he commits to the custody of longtime friend Sir Te his legendary sword, the beautiful, invincible Green Destiny, and is on the point of proposing to Shu Lien, who clearly shares his feelings, that they make a life together. His plans are interrupted by the reappearance of old foe Jade Fox (Cheng Pei Pei), who betrayed and murdered Mu Bai's master and stole the secret manual of Wudan's techniques. Resurfacing in Beijing, Jade Fox has become the governess of Yu Jen (Zhang Zi Yi), the daughter of a prominent government official. Slated for a loveless political marriage, Jen longs for any escape-into the remote deserts of her former home province; into an imagined world based on adventure tales, drawn from the real lives of warriors like Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien; into the arms of her secret love, a dashing barbarian bandit named Lo (Chang Chen). Her secret restlessness makes her vulnerable to manipulation by Jade Fox, but what makes her dangerous is her other secret: she is a martial arts prodigy of enormous potential. Half-trained by Jade Fox using the stolen Wudan manual, Jen has much of the technique but none of the Taoist philosophy; but even in this state she is a match for our heroes. Fascinated by the Giang Hu world (and her taste of it in her interlude with Lo), inspired by meeting Shu Lien, tempted by the now-idle Green Destiny, and poisoned by the influence of Jade Fox, Jen is a loose cannon, a menace to all those around her. Li Mu Bai, the embodiment of the Wuxia ideal, naturally wants revenge upon Jade Fox for her crimes against his master and his school; more than this, though, he wishes to take Jen as disciple to be Wudan's first female student - largely because without Wudan discipline she will surely become a villain far worse than her mistress. Shu Lien also comes to feel a sisterly affection for the young prodigy. Setting aside their personal needs, Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien take on Jade Fox in a struggle over the girl's fate, as the chaos swirling around her threatens to ensnare them all. True to its title, which names the animal pair most commonly representative of the contradictory and complementary principles of yin and yang in Taoist and Buddhist symbolism, the movie concentrates on the interaction of opposing forces. The consequences of impetuously pursuing one's desires contrast with the loss and regret that are the reverse of restraint and duty. The naive certainty of youth is weighed against the ambiguities of maturity. Jen's coming of age is juxtaposed against the mid-life conflict within Li Mu Bai. All of the main characters much decide when to fight to control their lives and when to acquiesce before forces that cannot be altered. Speaking of performances, I bow down to Michelle Yeoh. She simply shines as Shu Lien -- a humble warrior with strength, compassion, intuition and hundreds of other notable attributes. I cried for her during the end of this film. Not because she has the most beautiful finishing move or roundhouse kick, but because she is a damn fine actress and she made my heart ache for her. As she did in to James Bond in Tomorrow Never Dies and even Jackie Chan in Supercop, she almost steals the show again here. As Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien, Chow and Yeoh smolder with their characters' repressed passions. The actors incorporate the spirit of swordplay in their performances and alternate between slow, taut exchanges and lightning flashes of intense emotion. They likewise maintain character through their fighting sequences, in which Yeoh's Shu Lien moves with confident virtuosity, and Chow's Li Mu Bai, the accomplished master, needs to use only the sparest, most efficient techniques. These mega star veterans of Hong Kong and Hollywood fearlessly play up their maturity, imbuing their performances with an exquisite sense of loss; the curious result is that they have never seemed sexier. Zhang Zi Yi is ravishingly pretty as the confused and tormented Jen, and her background in dance helps her execute dazzling fight scenes and wire work. Comparisons to established Chinese actress Gong Li may well be justified, however; Zhang's performance, failing at times to arouse sympathy, makes her seem more cold and spoiled than anything else. Martial arts fans will be thrilled to see women's action pioneer Cheng Pei Pei's return to the screen as Jade Fox in her first role as a villain. Chang Chen, whom American audiences may remember from Wong Kar-Wai's wistful Happy Together, makes a dashing and likable barbarian Lo. Fans of Ang Lee's Taiwanese family-focused dramas will appreciate Lung Sihung's short but memorable appearance as Sir Te, patron and friend to Shu Lien and Mu Bai.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Top 50 isn't high enough,"I loved this movie, and every time i see it, it gets better. There were very few flaws in this movie. It's like there's no movement (from the camera, the actors or even a tree) that wasn't planned. It's the best mix of action, drama and romance I've ever seen. Many compared it with the matrix, but the two movies are completely different (except for the kung-fu and the flying). While the matrix (a great movie) was al about a hero saving the world, this movie was much more personal (and that makes it better than the matrix).But I don't understand the people who found the top 50 to high for this movie. Did they watch the same movie I did. This one definitely deserves a higher place. Maybe not top 10, but top20 at least. If there's one movie that shouldn't belong to the top 10, it's LotR.

An Ang Lee Masterpiece,"Critics have bemoaned the lack of quality in the films turned out in the year just past. With the exception of a few epic films like Gladiator and The Patriot, Steven Soderbergh's two films Erin Brockovich and Traffic, and some lesser known ""art films"" like Billy Elliot and You Can Count on Me, quality films have been in short supply. The really notable exception to this year's drought is Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.I saw this film over Christmas break in Washington D.C. To say that the audience was captivated would be a significant understatement. On two separate occasions the audience burst into applause in the middle of the film. They don't make them like they used to, but once in a while they make them even better.This may seem like an odd film for Ang Lee whose previous credits include Sense and Sensibility. What makes this film exceptional is that it combines the sensibilities of the romance film with the sensory ecstasy of a ballet. This film is frequently compared to The Matrix and the martial arts choreography is done by the same person--Yuen Wo-Ping. At many points the choreography is closer in style to the kinetic grace of ballet than to the rough-and-tumble action of the traditional fight scene.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of those films that has something for everyone. This is a traditional hero's quest where the central characters are trying to find a stolen sword that has great symbolic meaning for the characters. Unlike most Westerns or Samurai films wherein women are little more than moveable props, the women here are strong central characters in their own right. Romance is really at the center of the film and Ang Lee handles this part of the story with the same graceful unfolding that made Sense and Sensibility such an excellent film. Like The Matrix there are meanings at deeper levels where we find Jungian shadows, Yin and Yang, and almost anything else you want to look for.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has already won a number of awards including Golden Globes for best foreign language film and best director. Look for it to feature prominently in the Academy Award nominations. It may well become the third foreign language film in the past decade--Life is Beautiful and Il Postino being the other two--to be nominated for best picture. Whatever its destiny at the Academy Awards, this is clearly one of the best films of the year and is definitely worth a look.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Deserves all the oscars!!!,"A week ago I went to see Traffic. It was a good movie with compelling stories and unique cinematography..however my friends and I couldn't help but yawn little bit. I rented the gladiator and Erin Brokovich also. I was horrified at the graphic of the violence and typical HERO story..a lot like Braveheart,patriot,benhur.(we really need to move on!)It tries to capture the essense of Benhur but fails to reach the expectation by formulaic plot and computer graphic people.. Erin Brokovich is a feel good movie with catchy dialogue and good acting of Julia Roberts. I enjoyed the movie but why is it in the best picture catagory? I understand how much people want to hand that Oscar to Julia Roberts..but still.. I don't understand.

The best movie of the year?  No!  The most overrated movie of the year...Yes!!,"This movie is extremely overrated.  I can't understand how it could possibly have climbed so high in the IMDB movie ranks.  The highly regarded action sequences were usually met with laughter and giggles by the audience thanks to the exaggerated and overdone flying and superhuman jumping.  The story was OK...it certainly wasn't worthy of the praise bestowed upon it by the critics.  The story lacked dynamics...it seemed pretty convenient that the fight scenes came along to salvage a dip in the storyline.  The characters evolved very little through the movie.  The emotional scenes didn't grab me..or the audience since it was evident that most people were laughing at the ridiculous nature of the fighting. I can't say anything more specific without giving away things.  Basically, this is how I feel about CTHD:  Action scenes B-, Story C-, Acting B, Music B+...Overall entertainment value B-/C+. I think I'd rather see a Jackie Chan movie than CTHD again.  Now that's where you turn for great martial arts action...it's REAL!  CTHD really didn't live up to the hype.  It certainly does NOT deserve to be in the Top #250 of IMDB's movie rankings, which should be filled with the likes of su ch movies as Godfather, It's a Wonderful Life, Citizen Kane, Braveheart, Gandhi, Schindler's List, etc...etc...How in the world did CTHD get up there??

Not for martial arts fans.,"This is not a martial arts movie.  Don't go to ""Crouching Tiger"" expecting to see one.  The fight scenes are intriguing but only because they are complete fantasy.  After 5 screen minutes of non-stop sword fighting the combatants hadn't even broken a sweat but I was panting from exertion watching it.This is the story of a legend that we enter into as though it's our world. Unless you regard it as that you may be disappointed.  It's really a ""chick flick"" in many respects: the male characters are only silhouettes while the females are three dimensional and more.  Still, there are motivations here that remain a mystery and you will leave the theater discussing them.  It may even cause you to dream about flying!Note for people who HATE talkers in the audience: the subtitles kept our crowd of moviegoers just about soundless - they couldn't read and yak at the same time.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
movie reflecting perennial wisdom (sophia perennis),"I think this movie was excellent. This has many reasons. The most obvious of them, is that it reflects the perennial wisdom, which is quite forgotten in the modern world. The modern man, who grows up in a secularized and desecrated world forgot the meanings of virtue and This movie just reminds us, how beautiful the world and especially how beautiful virtuous people can be. It is an eastern but universal wisdom which speaks out in this opus magnum. As a Muslim, I really found some sacred elements referring to God in this movie. All the modern world has to see it, in order to get enlightened in the right way and not in the modern way.Last but not least, this movie talks to your heart, to your mind and to your soul.

Fighting interspersed with an actual plot line!,"An epic in every sense of the word, this film combines some of the coolest fight sequences ever put to the big screen with majestic cinematography and an all-encompassing tale of love, honor and fantasy. And by fantasy, I mean people literally flying across rooftops and fighting against one another while standing on skinny tree branches. That's right, you can pretty much forget about the concept of gravity in this movie! People fly while running, walk across water and run up walls in this film. Real cool stuff if you get ""into it"", but definitely unbelievable if you're, well, not ""into it"". Which brings me to the actual story of the film. A hundred times better than most Hong Kong martial arts flicks, I can't say that I was mesmerized by this sorted tale. In fact, I thought some of the scenes were a little boring, especially the middle ones in the desert, which went on too long. I also didn't really get emotionally attached to any of the characters, or feel much for them by the end of the film. The story wasn't a bad one, it's just that some of the plot points nagged at me somewhat. Here are these great warriors searching for the evil Jade Fox, and even though she's the governess of the girl they're quite familiar with, they don't recognize her? And what about their relationship to the girl? Every time they see her, they either fight or embrace her. A little too ambiguous for my taste. But maybe that's just me.I did however enjoy the overall story which effectively combined dramatic elements with humor, action and even a touch of romance. For me, the best parts of the movie were obviously the battle scenes, which just blew my friggin' eyes away! In fact, I suspect that most people who see this movie will love it just for the battle scenes alone since pretty much everything else is so-so. People will also find themselves staring at the screen and wondering how the hell they managed to put together all of those cool moves. But again, if wire-fu stunts don't do it for you, and fast-motion fight scenes ain't your cup of tea, don't go into this movie expecting ""Gone with the Wind"". It's a wonderfully photographed picture, with beautiful details in the settings, its authenticity and the obvious language spoken (the film is in Mandarin with English subtitles), but its wonder resonates most with its fight sequences, and if that sort of thing doesn't impress you, this film likely isn't for you.

Zhang Ziyi is so fine,This movie kick ass.  One of the best I've seen.  Zhang Ziyi looks great. She is so beautiful and cute in her own way.  And a pretty good fighter. Not the best but she kicks ass.  Zhang Ziyi might even kick Jet Li ass too. Zhang Ziyi My Asian Angel Girl.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Cool, but the twist...","First, I could have sworn it was ""Wo hu zang long."" Next, a story with little point (not the films): My brother wanted me to stay away from this. My other brother saw this, and said it was good. I changed my mind. (Well, the twist also helped-more on that later.) When it comes out to rent, I rent it. My feelings are ahead.It seems a bit overrated. While the Green Destiny was cool, and the fights and such were nice, the twist was what I saw it for. And now, here it is: I could not tell what it was. Seems a bit like Gone in Sixty Seconds, but the case is different: Where GISS has predictable ending, this doesn't have one. The problem is, it has more than one twist at the end. I will not mention them.Moral: Overrated, but good. But, what part of ending is the twist?",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprised to see so many Haters,"To those who doesn't understand how the people fly around.It actually cames from ancient Chinese Martial Art (wushu or Kung fu), theres something called ""hing kung"", which aids the user in becoming sort of ""lighter"" (hing means light). This concept has been widely used in Chinese martial art themes.If you've seen Jacky Cheng climbing up the walls in insane speed, this is that sort of thing what hing kung is, I recall the code where ""hands move feet follows""Also if you've seen in a movie where ninjas jumping around, this is basically the same idea, because most Japanese martial arts are inherited from the Chinese ones.This is one of the best filmed Kung Fu films out there. The fight scenes are awesome and the crew did put alot of work in perfecting them.Well people who claim to hate this film because it's ""unreal"" are probably foreigners, who doesn't like fantasy stuff, or is simply jealous because this film kicked so much azz.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Kung fu scenes beautiful, but way too exaggerated","Watched the movie. First reaction I had (and practically ALL the theater goers in the cinema) was that the fighting scenes were WAYYYYYY too exaggerated. Flying and swooping on the roofs, gliding across a lake the size of a football field ... geez.But the swordplay was good though. I thought the story line was straight forward but at times pretty slow moving.Also, the dialogue was in Mandarin as spoken by the actors themselves. To a Chinese, I thought Chow and Michelle had pretty shaky diction. hee :)Overall, it's a curious peek into the hype that surrounds it, but not something I would watch again.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My god!Another!,"I saw this film in the film club in our school. I didn't intend to see it because I knew it would be a disappointment to me. However, it is even worse than I expected. Being a chinese, I might have been proud of it because it won in Oscar, had I not seen it. Heaven knows what story is the film telling. And the scenes in it seems so unreal. How on earth can such a film won Oscar? By the way, I hope they will stop making chinese style action films.

"boring movie, inexplicable success","I'm not British, but when I left the theater the phrase that cameirresistibly to mind was: ""what an old load of codswallop!"" Tenminutes of portentous, wit-free dialogue about nothing particularlyreal is followed by several minutes of choreographed imitationfighting, likewise unreal; then again leaden dialogue, and againcartoon fighting, over and over until at long last the thing limps toan unconvincing conclusion. I've admired Ang Lee's films for theirclose examination of character; I had thought this would combinethe usual martial arts nonsense with a real story about believablepeople. Nothing of the kind, alas--just a very expensive videogame. Bits of it were pretty, as a Nature special on PBS is pretty,but actors swooping around in the trees are not inherently anymore interesting than macaws doing likewise, and the macawshave better motivation. This movie was as dumb, and as wildlyoverrated, as ""Gladiator,"" and that's saying a lot.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Breath Taking!,"Fast, Swift, Skillful, and Cunning. This movie got a lot of all the way! Ang Lee has made the best martial art film I've ever seen! ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" takes where others have their limits. Chow Yun Fat plays a master who guards a sword with a ""Emerald Blade"" to it. Michelle Yeoh(Supercop 1&2,) plays the friend and lover of the master. And I liked the way of the choreographs were made. Flying and fighting at the same time, not using ropes or cables to climb. That will made the most skilled fighter bow into defeat. Zhang Ziyi, plays the fighter who steals the sword, and learns hard truths from the two. She is a formidable fighter, and a big hothead as well. She does have a sexy side to her, after being kidnapped, her true self is portrayed well to say the least. I wish I could say more about this movie, but it's up to you to see it for yourself. This movie is to good to explain to everyone, I enjoyed every time I watch it. 5 STARS!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A magnificent film spectacle,"This is a movie where it seems that the whole and the sum of the parts are different and yet are both big. The story is often confusing but not irritating and one wonders about its flow at moments. Yet it is never boring and always has something new to draw you into it. It is difficult to sum it up as a whole. Some of its parts: 1. The Chinese desert - simply breathtaking and different from any other desert seen on film. 2. The cities - those aerial views are something else! 3. The fights - the action scenes in ""The Matrix"" were great and original; the ones here are incredible and way beyond those. A must-see movie, for the story or the cinematography or any of its parts. I regret seeing it so late in its showings locally, as I wanted to see it again.

An unforgettable martial arts movie!,"Like most Asian born Canadian, I have grown up watching many martial arts film. To be very honest with you, most of them, if not all, never met my expectations, but ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was the first excellent martial arts movie, because watching the movie was like seeing a dream that was finally coming true.Unlike so many martial arts movie, the emphasis is put on the plot, the mood and the feelings, so that's why the story is so well written. However, James Schamus, the script writer, followed too much the ""rules"" for creating a martial arts movie, so that's why some people might say that the movie is full of clichés. For instance, how many times have you seen a martial arts master who wants to avenge his master's death? Everyone must have seen it a lot of time. After all, unlike what I have previously seen, James Schamus finds a very brilliant way to present, at the same time, both the love story between Li Mu-Bai and Shu Lien, and the story of vengeance without creating any long periods. In short, one the main strength of this movie is its emphasis on the story line, the feelings and the mood, because unfortunately, so many martial arts movies that were produced before ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" only focus on the fight scenes.Obviously, one wouldn't expect to see so much depth in a martial arts movie. Speaking about the cast's performance, Chow Yun-Fat (Anna and the King), Michelle Yeoh (Tomorrow Never Dies) and Zhang Ziyi (The Road Home) all have an undeniable ability to bring their respective character's feelings to the surface and the chemistry between them is so impeccable. Well, at least, we can admire such a great acting without cringing. Personally, I found this movie better than all the Jackie Chan's and Bruce Lee's movies, because for once, the movie director has worked very hard on the story line and the acting. Although the fight scenes are unrealistic, I was stunned by them, because I found them visually poetic, in a manner of speaking.Finally, I am sure that in at least 20 years, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" will certainly be remembered not only as a greatly entertaining movie, but also a very smart, deep and an intellectually challenging movie. Moreover, let it be said that Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee will certainly have a very low profile because of this movie and also other martial arts movies, such as ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers"".",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Such a disappointment,"I had been looking forward to this movie for quite some time, mainly because of all the rave reviews it got in all the press out there. But to my astonishment I was very disappointed with this movie.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (CTHD) is pretending to be this very deep and philosophical fairytale about Jedi Knight-like warriors who transcend earthly bonds and jump around like they can fly. The best one of this pack, a role by Chow Yun Fat, is sick and tired of his warrior existence and decides to quit and give his sword, Sword of the Green Something, to some official in Peking and call it quits. But there we have his arch enemy, Jade Hyena, who killed his master and who has trained an apprentice. This apprentice, Jen, played to excellence by Ziyi Zhang, has her eye set on the sword to become the next greatest Wudan (the order) big-shot. Along the way there are some love-interests played out, but these just take way to long.All in all a nice premise for a fantasy fairy-tale set in China. Unfortunately director Ang Lee chose to keep the pace a little too slow. In many scenes I was bored out of my skull and I even fell asleep regularly during the whole desert sequence, I'm sorry. The acting was good enough from some people to not annoy me. It was nice to see Chow Yun Fat return to his native language, as was Michelle Yeoh, who by the way made no particular impression on me. Fat's death in the end made no impact at all on me, as was the totally incomprehensible ending, what was up with that?The real merit for this movie goes out to the production designer. Timmy Yip did a great job of creating wonderful settings and decors. The costume design was great as well. Props also. There was nothing wrong with these elements. The fight scenes was very well choreographed, but they could have been a little bit less long. They seemed sometimes to go on and on without really going anywhere. The fact that the Wodan warriors had the ability to fly didn't make me like the movie more, on the contrary, it distracted me from the actual fighting going on. In The Matrix this type of choreography for fight scenes was perfectly in place, it was right on target given the surroundings. But in this movie it was just too much over the top. One more thing, shouldn't swords be just a little more rigid as opposed to what the swords looked like in this movie. They looked like they could bend and crease very easily.I must be invoking just everybody's wrath by now, and before people start trying to kill me for beating down on this supposed gem, I'm gonna quit this review. I award this a 7 just for the production design.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Unbelievable film making,"I haven't seen a movie like this truly in a long long time, one of the most powerful yet emotional movies I've ever seen.1- The visuals are stunning and this is for the cinematography in particular, it was so beautiful.2- The acting was rather good, the actors managed to show their emotions very well under the supervision of the master Ang Lee.3- The art direction and the costumes were stunning; I think the best in the year 2000.4- And the musical score, OH MY GOODNESS, it was magical; with the combination of Chinese and Eastern music the composer came up with something unbelievably beautiful.5- Now combine all that with a fantastic adapted screenplay and a brilliant director who did an absolutely great job.The greatness of this film comes from its simplicity, life was simple back then so is the movie, and I don't agree with those who criticized the movie about the flying people, because it is a part of the Chinese culture, and oh my god it is a beautiful culture.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Entertaining, but what was the big deal?...","First, I'd like to say that I enjoyed the film overall, and if I seem somewhat critical, it is because I've seen so many people rave on and on, and I just don't get all the hoopla.  My biggest problem is likely the lack of explanation.  I realize this is a martial-arts ""fantasy,"" but in most films, there is at least some attempt to explain the setting and, if any, differences from reality.  For example, in ""The Matrix,"" we're given an early glimpse of the powers of the freedom-fighters, and eventually we discover that they are bending and breaking rules in ways that seem fantastic, but still make sense as they are explained in the movie.  In ""Star Wars,"" we are introduced to ""the Force"" and the wondrous abilities it can bestow.  In ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" the masters have these amazing abilities (beyond fighting skill, I mean) that are never in anyway justified.  I can take some of this on faith, and simply enjoy the story and effects, but it started to bother me after a while.  For one thing, the commoners (or at least, the non-masters) don't seem to think anything amazing is going on.  ""Oh look, the thief just leapt over that building.  I won't gape in amazement, I'll just continue the chase...""  I could live with the characters having enhanced abilities, this is fantasy after all, but I think major physics-defying capabilities deserve an explanation.  Why can this person push off from a wall, fly across a courtyard, and without touching anything, change direction UPWARDS?  Where do they draw the line? It just seemed a little hokey.  Having said all that, I'll reiterate that once I looked past these things, I was able to enjoy the film for what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Most Overrated Film I Ever Saw,How could this movie make your top 10 list?  The plot was ridiculous.  The fight scenes were no big deal (generally any low budget Chinese Kung Fu movie has similar scenes.  What was with all the flying?   And the 70 year old woman who reads a manual and becomes an awesome Kung Fu master?The beginning of the movie introduces a sword that is very old (I think about 400 years) that gets stolen.  It then turns out that nobody really cares about the sword.It then turns out that an aristocratic young woman (who also read a manual and became and awesome Kung Fu master) stole the sword.  Why? It is never really explained.  She also had an affair with a guy in the desert who leads a band of rebels.  The scene where they meet involves him attacking her caravan and stealing her fan.  She chases after him on horseback.  There are some horse riding tricks performed as the two battle on their horses (something like Indiana Jones did in Raiders of the Lost Ark).The fight scenes are an insult to anyone that has studied martial arts.  One person can take on hundreds and never get tired.  (the director needs to see any Jean Claude Van Damme film to see what exciting fighting looks like) And then they fly and float in the air like Mary Martin in Peter Pan.  There is also a scene where the old woman shoots poisonous needles through a Gatling gun type device and the needles are blocked by the heroes swinging their swords.This movie is two hours long and the plot just didn't ever make sense. The ending was ridiculous too.  Hollywood must have made real garbage last year if this bomb could have been considered for an Oscar.,3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Worst movie seen in 3 years,"Crouching is terrible.  It has no plot line, only a plot scribble. Transition is sometimes impossible to follow.

A Modern Masterpiece,"Lets quickly pardon the dreadful American/English/Irish/unknown-origin voice dubbing, and strangely unrelated subtitles on the DVD, and cut straight to the chase. This is perhaps the most visually beautiful film I have ever seen. Almost every single frame is perfectly composed and lit. The story really is incidental - as is the acting, although the latter is still first-class. Ziyi Zhang is an absolute delight, stunningly beautiful as well as incredibly skilled in her art. Yun-Fat Chow and Michelle Yeoh give highly accomplished performances.However the real stars of this show are the cameramen and lighting directors, etc etc, who have created a masterpiece - pick a frame and hang it in any gallery in the world. So much craftsmanship is evident here it makes you realise just how bad most movies are. And the martial arts and wire-work on display here are second-to-none, in places quite breath-taking.

"Watch this movie as a drama, not just a martial art film","The English title of this movie is really hilarious. ""Wo Hu Cang Long"" is a slang, it actually means ""a true masters (about everything, not only martial art) are pretend themselves instead of being showy."" Maybe ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" sounds more ""chinese"" for Westerners who has a stereotyping about dragons for Chinese people.Being an Chinese-speaking person who knows more about the culture background about this story, I have discussed this movie with many people in the United States.I find out most of people appreciate the amazing martial arts and ignore the in-depth analyzing of this story.If you think this story is only a story about martial art, I think i should ask you guys a question: Woule you only treat The Lord of The Rings as a fairy tale, or City of God as a disturbing film? The whole story deals with betrayal and redemption about Jiao Long's life of martial art under Chinese culture. That is all I can say for people who have never seen this movie.If you have seen this movie once and love those amazing scenes, I recommend you to watch it again and enjoy characteristics and interactions in that movie; if you have never watched it, I think my comment will be useful for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The worst Mandarin accents I have ever heard,"In general this film is decent entertainment, but one thing stops it from entering the upper tier of great films. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh have atrocious Mandarin accents - imagine Arnold Schwarzenegger in a 19th Century British drama and you'd be close. Chow is a Cantonese-speaker from HK, and Yeoh is from Malaysia - neither speaks Mandarin remotely like a mainlander. The fact that Ang Lee did not train them to speak better, or have them rerecord their dialogue, suggests that this film  was never intended for a Chinese audience. It was always meant as a ""foreign"" film for US consumption. In fact, I have come across a VCD of this film in China in which Chow and Yeoh's voices were overdubbed by other Chinese actors with normal accents.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

There is no question that it is a good movie, visually, musically, and even the story.But if you have true fan of chinese movies, especially the ones about the older generation and the way they think, like ""Raise the Red Lantern"", you will realize that this movie's true aim is to criticize the old way of thinking and how it robs people their freedom/happiness.  (which in subjective)  I think it an old theme and should be laid to rest long time ago.I also have a big problem with the character Yu Jen, played by Ziyi Zhang, she is not the victim, like many would think and she is, by no means, the hero.  She is a spoiled brat that walked all over everyone else's interests in achieving her own.

"I hate to jump on the bandwagon, but... Wondrous!","There's a telling moment near the beginning of Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.""In closeup, we see the rough-hewn, heavy wooden wheels of a peasant cart. They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.What a film this is.  Everything you've heard is right.  It may not be the most wondrous thing ever...but it is a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart...that also has some absolutely breath-taking action scenes.  ""Crouching Tiger..."", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's ""Lawrence of Arabia!"") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights.  High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in the winds.In this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called ""wire work"" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Washowski's but the choreographer of ""Crouching Tiger..."" also staged the wire-fights of ""Matrix.""  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The guy with whom I saw the advance screening and I...the whole packed-in audience at the big theater at Pipers Alley...burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...  At other moments, I found myself in absolute weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become all drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.Apart from anything, this is a grand story!  It has passion...love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.And, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in semi-love with her for a long time.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than anything I've seen her in (she was a recent ""Bond Girl"").  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.Chow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.The center of the film...remarkably...is a girl who looks to be about 15! Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  I say that she is remarkable because her story is the binding element of the film.  And she holds the film together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both the dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas de deus (okay...did I spell that right?) that frame the conflicts between them.  She is the ""Luke Skywalker"" of the piece, if you will...though ""Crouching Tiger..."" has everything the ""Star Wars"" saga had: excitement, thrills and magic, but here, it is wrapped in those things Lukas film wanted to give, but succeeded in delivering in only the most self-conscious way: heart and deep-placed spirit.By the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood onscreen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the ""Full Peckinpaw,"" if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully!While there are those who might grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and trick photography...okay...true enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is put in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile burdens of emotions!So there.    Enough?  Just go see it.I can't wait for the DVD!  I'll probably see it again, maybe see it twice again, before it hits the home-market.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the most beautiful films in years...,"""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is one of the most beautiful and most fulfilling movie experiences in years. I love many films but I can count with one hand the movies that have the subtlety and beauty of ""Crouching Tiger"". What Ang Lee has made is beautiful, wonderful cinema. I'll start with the action and flying scenes, they were absolutely breathtaking, subtle and beautifully coreographed, the flying was like watching ballet in the air, so magical and the fight sequences have to be probably the best fight sequences to be put in film, they are so well done and the movie is so deep that through these fight scenes the characters express their feelings, they're done gracefully and without gore at all. The romance of the characters is beautiful, vivid and full of emotions, the affair between Jen and the bandal Lo was such a breath of fresh air, the flashback scene was wonderful, and the undeclared love of Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien was so honorable and pure. The cinematography is wonderful, the forests, waterfalls, lakes, deserts, all look wonderful and so beautiful, this is a visual feast for the eyes. The acting and the characters are amazing, from the wild, independent and ingenue Jen, who is an aristocrat young girl looking for freedom and an exciting life wonderfully portrayed by the beautiful Zhang Ziyi, to the subtle and deeply moving Shu Lien performed by the talented Michelle Yeoh, to the sublime and wise Li Mu Bai played by the terrific Chow-Yun Fat. The story or stories are handled so well, from the theft of the sword, to the love story between the characters, to the master-alumn relationships, to the love-hate relationships, and the revenge plot as well, they're all given the same importance and are wonderfully juggled through scenes. Overall, one of the best films to come in years with the two greatest cinematic moments of the year: The treetop scene and the jump, breathtaking, exhilarating, phylosophical and poetic, with a high touch of magic and inmense beauty, vivid romance and blowing martial arts, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is an absolute masterpiece and will be remembered for many years to come.ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!!! 10/10!!! 5 out of 5!!!

"Amazing martial arts, beautiful settings, a must see","After having seen the film, my brother told me that he actually wasn't sure whether he loved or hated this film. It is perhaps for its huge difference to average hollywood action movies. In my opinion this movie had deserved the oscar for best film instead of Gladiator, but Hollywood seems to be unable to acknowledge foreign genius in moviemaking. On the surface, the film deals with two warriors (a man and a woman) trying to recapture a stolen sword. But at the heart of it lie two tragic love stories who give this movie substance besides the amazingly directed action sequences.

It's not really a martial arts flick,"Okay, this movie is decent, but it's not one of the best films of all time. It is certainly stylish, well thought-out, well acted and innovative in the elements that are combined in its execution, but the characters and story do not allow it to attain the status of masterpiece.My main problem is that the background is sort of a vague fantasy. It is a distinct period piece with generous creative liberties taken on behalf of the director. We know it is Qing China based on the family life of Jen (Ziyi Zhang) but nothing in the film is particularly historical. There are vague horde-like bandits, Wudang martial arts, random snippets of ""philosophy"" that sound like they could possibly be Buddhist or Daoist, yet nothing is concrete. This kinda irked me when I watched the movie recently. Despite appearing as a religious or martial arts-themed film, the film doesn't investigate either of those things.I also didn't particularly care for any of the characters. No one had a real sense of humor and the love theme (THE theme) struck me as cliché and predictable. The main character, Jen, is supposed to be some kind of symbol of tortured feminism from this period (she can't be happy anywhere in this society) but it didn't come across very eloquently. I found her a real hassle to watch on-screen. Or maybe that's the point?The musical score was a bit much. I felt the film-makers were relying a bit too much on the music. Perhaps the film is indeed rather balanced, in making sure not to leave the viewer's attention on any one technical aspect, so in that regard it is a very good mainstream cinematic work. But the shots of the Gobi Desert ""contrasted"" against Yo-Yo Ma's cello playing was just over-saturation and bordered on self-parody.I don't think this or anything else I've seen by Ang Lee is necessarily a masterpiece (although I should point out I have not seen Brokeback Mountain or Lust/Caution). But it is a very solid, entertaining film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Doesn't work for me.,"Positives, - The music, costumes, set design all deserve strong praise, the action sequences are also fast and slick. The film clocks in at a comfortable 2 hours.On the negative side the colours are rather pasty, maybe this was the original intention of the cinematographer or maybe not.Some the action too would probably work better in a cartoon than a live action film, a character at one point is frozen after being hit, yes that's right frozen, it comes off as comical. Just about all the main characters are experts at fighting with little background introduction stating why this is. Also the worst offense in the film is characters flying around, again without explanation, at least the Matrix had an internal logic about why the laws of physics could be broken, this doesn't. It also looks rather bad, no better than the Angel scenes in Chaplin's the Kid, filmed about 100 years before this.Much of the action is also a bit pointless, and the editing in the desert scene again was comical, also the fighting on horses wasn't very well filmed either, with the camera too far from the action.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good. Great, maybe. But overrated.","CTHD is a good, competent film. It has good special effects and a good script. The cinematography is amazing. The performances are very good. But.. why is it #9 on the top 250 list at IMDB, while ""Patton"" sits way back. It's a martial arts film with poetic overtones.. just because the American public is allowed a glimpse into another culture's world of film (typically too lazy to track something foreign down unless it's highly reccomended or publicly released) it doesn't make it top 10 material. CTHD is probably one of the greatest films of all time. But it's overrated. This is definitely worth seeing, but it has some flaws (a 20-minute, episodic flashback, for example) and they never really explain the whole flying thing, which has some Chinese-religious backgrounds, which may confuse viewers. The point is, this is a good, solid film. It's just not all it's cracked up to be.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A pinnacle of visual storytelling.,"This is a martial arts movie for people who don't like martial arts movies (I am one such person). The name of CTHD refers to a Chinese metaphor for someone hiding their strength. That is exactly what the protagonist of the movie is notorious for.This protagonist is a teenage girl from a high-ranking official's family. Her name is Jiao Long, which literally translates to ""Little Dragon"". They call her ""Jen"" in the popular subtitle versions and the dubs, but just be aware that that Westernized version is not her actual name. I suppose ""Jen"" was picked both to evoke a sense of familiarity, and because ""Jiao"" starts with a consonant that's pronounced both like a ""J"" and ""Sh"", so it's deemed to be confusing for Westerners. But you'll pick up on this when you watch the subtitled version - you'll read ""Jen"", but clearly hear them call her by her real name (""Jiao Long"").(Incidentally, subtitles are best way to watch non-English-language movies - too many crucial intonations get lost and twisted in dubbed versions. Watch this with subs. Your mind can keep track of two things at once, trust me.)Right, so Jiao Long, played by the beautiful, graceful (lengthy dancing practice in childhood), and passionate Zhang Ziyi, is outwardly a good daughter, but secretly a complete rebel. The last few years she's been studying a Wu-Tang manual on martial arts, and, unbeknownst to those around her, achieved amazing results with it. When fate (with a bit of help from Jiao herself) brings her together with two renowned martial artists and warriors, Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien, Jiao Long is extremely eager to confront these two living legends in combat - to show off, prove something to herself... and ultimately gain that precious thing - a clear purpose in life.Here I come to the main strength of the movie, for me, at least, which is why I've rewatched it quite a few times: it is sublimely and complexly philosophical. We have a girl in turmoil, struggling to choose her values, morals, path in life. Most of us will recognize these processes and empathize with them. The interesting thing is that as she looks to the ""adults"" around her, particularly Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien, she discovers (and helps them discover) their many own flaws and insecurities. They seem sure and confident, but beneath the surface you see the same feeling of being puzzled and dissatisfied, searching and not finding, living by a principle and ending up disappointing in it.The second strength is the fight and action choreography. Unlike those other nonsensical MA movies (like the Chinese Jet Li flicks and the army of Jet-Li-flick clones) which stuff your face with flight scenes and while-in-the-air tricks, CTHD's action feels more real even though it employs many of the same tricks. It just does it so much more tastefully, selectively, and to the point.The overall visual direction and the sets are beautiful. The story rolls along at a satisfying pace, and the gorgeous backdrops and decorations aren't overdone or covering up a lack of meaningful plot, like in those House-of-Daggers-Hero-type films. Oh yes, and the music is very tasty.Zhang is a joy to look at every moment of the movie, and the rest of the cast fit the bill perfectly. Not overacting, not being bland - just right.A unique masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great introduction to Chinese cinema,"This was my introduction to Chinese martial arts films so when I first saw it I had no idea what to expect, I just knew it had raked in quite a few awards. I really enjoyed it from the start although I must admit that I was somewhat surprised by the gravity defying fight scenes although they were easy accept once I'd realised such action was just part of the genre.The film opens with Li Mu Bai, a martial arts master played by Chow Yun Fat, giving his sword to Yu Shu Lien the wife of his late brother played by Michelle Yeoh, so that she can take it to Peking and give it to his old friend Sir Te as he wants to retire from fighting. Soon after Governor Yu and his family come to Peking and the sword is stolen by a mysterious stranger who appears to be part of the Governor's retinue. Yu Shu Lien befriends the governor's daughter Jen, played by Zhang Ziyi, who is due to be married but would rather become a fighter like Yu Shu Lien. As the story progresses Li Mu Bai returns and believes his nemesis Jade Fox is involved in the theft of the sword and sets out to find her. Tied in with the action plot there is also a romance involving Jen and a desert bandit called Lo, also known as Dark Cloud.The acting was very good through out, especially Zhang Ziyi's portrayal of Jen who I considered to be the main character despite her not getting top billing, I suppose that is down to her being a less established actress at the time it was made. The cinematography was excellent showing a variety of stunning Chinese scenery varying from a bare desert to a beautiful bamboo forest. As one would expect the fighting scenes are very well choreographed less expected were the moments of humour which I felt added to the film. I would certainly recommend this film; I enjoyed it enough to seek out other examples of the genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon--A story of courage, love, hate, forgiveness and a girl who wanted something in her life","Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon--A beautiful movie that will captivate its viewers...An Wu Xia film that is filled with love and romance.Li Mu Bai(Chow Yun Fatt) is a legendary warrior in the show whose skills are incomparable. Shu Lian( Michelle Yeoh) is his friend. Both of them love each other with all their heart, yet, because of their pursuit of justice and peace, they do not make their love open to each other despite knowing how deep they each love each other. Yet, their love is true and some may say everlasting. Through the show, viewers can feel their love but yet, it pains them to watch these two warriors keep their feeling hidden despite their desire to marry each other. At the end of the film, as Li Mu Bai dies, he finally tells Shu Xian that he had always loved her. As she cradles him in her arms, he says that he will not use his last breath to meditate to leave this earth because he wants to follow her when he is a spirit, because her love will not make him lonely. That, is the most touching scene of the show. Even through death, their love shall not cease, because the love that binds them together is true and pure.Their relationship not only adds a new face to Wu xia films but also touches viewers's hearts.Jen( Zhang Zi Yi) a aristocrat who is the secret disciple of the notorious Jade Fox brings something more to this film. It shows the story of a girl who self learned the Wu Dan manual and wanted something extrodianary and exciting in her life. Going to be married to someone she did not love, she feels that soon her freedom will be gone, so she steals Li Mu Bai's sword for fun an also returns it later. But after a while, she is caught in a situation which is much more serious. She finally reveals to Jade Fox what she had kept from her. She had kept the secret of the Wu Dan manual to herself so as Jade Fox would not improve, causing her governess to hate her. Yet, through the show, no matter how much trouble Jen causes, viewers can feel her confusion. She is torn between Li Mu Bai and Jade Fox as she can choose to follow one. In the end, she follows her own path and is saved by Li Mu Bai, but he dies. Seeing all this, she becomes good and travels to the Wu Dan mountain where her true lover was. There, she jumped down the mountain, fulfilling a legend about -a man who jumped down a mountain to get his wish to come true..the wish she had was not hers but her lovers, and she floated away.....Her story shows how from and innocent girl, she learns the ways of a warrior and turns from bad to good. In the end, she freed herself from all hurt and sorrow, by fulfilling her lover's wish.This movie is a movie that words cannot describe. What I have said is not good enough to describe it. The only way to feel and understand the emotions of the show is to watch it. It will carve a way through the hardest of hearts and will leave you mystified at the beautiful show. 10/10 is my grade.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not the best film of it's genre, but well worth watching","In ancient China, martial-arts master Li Mu Bai wants to avenge his own master, who was killed by a mysterious assassin called Jade Fox. He receives help from beautiful Yu Shu Lien who is a martial-arts master herself. They both are (secretly) in love but aren't brave enough to tell each other. As a mysterious thief steals Li Mu Bai's sword, he and Yu Shu Lien know that Jade Fox must be very close. Meanwhile Yu Shu Lien also became a friend of a young girl named Jen Yu. But who is she, and why does she use the very same martial arts techniques of Jade Fox, brought near to perfection even better than by Li Mu Bai's arch enemy?This film caused gigantic hype all over the world. It's a beautiful (and somehow very sad) romance as well as an impressive martial-arts fantasy film with incredibly well choreographed action sequences. During those fights the film really manages to create an atmosphere of awe and magic. It is well worth watching for everybody interested in Eastern cinema. And Zi-Yi Zhang is absolutely gorgeous as Jen Yu! But I still don't understand why it was THIS film that caused all the hype, and then especially in the west. It never comes close to the real masterpiece of modern Hong Kong fantasy films that is, in my opinion, ""A Chinese Ghost Story"" and it's sequels. There are in fact lots of somehow similar, but far more beautiful movies from Asia nobody ever saw in the west, such as the Japanese ""Chûshingura gaiden - Yotsuya kaidan"" or the Korean film ""The Gingko Bed"".

But so what if people fly around? I found nothing special about this film that makes it stand out from other contemporary chinese films. Or maybe because I've seen too many chinese movies to acknowledge the fuss. There are many other chinese films that have much better plots, but they were just never able to have a big enough budget to open like CTHD.

To those who think this is a good movie.,"I personally think this movie is totally a failure, at least it is in the theaters of Beijing. And I feel really bad when I heard that it's becoming popular in the United States. I need to write something here for you Hidden Dragon fans.A: The heavy accent: Most of you guys can't understand Chinese, so it really don't matter to you. But for me, listening to their accent is like listening to George Bush saying :""Hi, guys, I am from New York.""  And that really gets me under my skin.B: The special effects: Totally fake, you can clearly feel the rope pulling them here and there. And I bet the girl called Zhang Ziyi never even went to P.E. class in her middle school(a must if you are a chinese middle school student), each move of her martial art was very much like NiuYangGe---a kind of Chinese folk dance. Anyway, if you watch enough Gongfu movies--even made in Mainland China, you'll know the difference.C: The language: Very hollywood. I mean I understand hollywood lines, right, they are hopeless already, (though I have to admit that some hollywood lines ARE cute),  but why the heck do you have to put all that in a Chinese movie? Well, I noticed it does mention something like calligraphy and Chinese traditional medicine or stuff, but it was just all naive and shallow. Therefore, I sympathize those American when they see all that and cry out loud ""Wow, that's awesome!! Because I don't understand!!!""D: The plot: Very boring, and incrediablly unreasonable, though I would highly recommend it as a classical post-modern study subject or something.E: My boss: He is one of the American Chinese brought up in Taiwan, a complete red-neck idiot.

It did not attract the Chinese audience the first time shown in theater in China. It was until it got an Academic Award, people here went to see it.The Crouching Tiger is just a Kongfu movie shot for foreigners, not for Chinese.

Most wonderful movie I have ever seen.,"This is maybe my favourite movieCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a remarkable movie. The movie, which is directed by Ang Lee, certainly qualifies as an ""art movie"" but it is also very entertaining.The film has become widely known for its impressive martial arts sequences,but the underlying love story is equally powerful. The movie has some of exceptional special effects, that you have never seen before. The photography and choreography are also exceptional and the music is amazing, it really matches the atmosphere,scenes and feelings between the different characters.The plot concerns around the fateful decision of Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) to retire his trusted warrior's weapon, the Green Destiny, a sword that has proven to be both a blessing and a curse. But one day the Green Destiny is stolen and they begin to discover that the sword may be in the hands of Jade Fox, the notorious warrior who killed Li Mu Bai's master. And then they start the pursuit of her and whats soon to be discovered as her student.You must remember that this movie is nothing like Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan, Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme's movies. Here, martial arts are used to underscore the emotions of the story. Whenever the characters are filled with anger, love, hate, jealousy or joy you can expect to see those emotions displayed artfully through combat.There is a great deal of fighting, but little blood or gore. I guarantee that the fighting scenes in this movie is the most spectacular you have ever seen.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of the most wonderful movies I have seen, and the movie takes place in a decade in chinese history that is very facinating and beautiful. You are also going to notice that this movie has some strong  feminine characters,such as Michelle Yeoh and ZiYi Zhang, and they delivers maybe the greatest performances of the year.Go see this one,you wont regret it.I give it a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not exactly my cup of tea but I liked it,"I'm not exactly a die hard-fan of the Japanese martial arts movies. Many years ago I've seen one of the Bruce Lee movies. I didn't hate the movie, but I wasn't a huge fan of the genre either. Of course, I knew ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" wouldn't be an ordinary martial arts movie, it had to be more than that. Otherwise it wouldn't have such a high ranking in the Top 250. After seeing the trailer, I really wanted to see the movie as well.""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" certainly wasn't a disappointment. The three leading actors Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh and the beautiful Ziyi Zhang gave excellent performances. The story was quite good, although it wasn't the most brilliant story ever. What makes the movie worth watching is of course the several beautiful and amazing fight sequences. The choreography is perfect. Of course, people walking in the sky and stuff like that isn't very believable, but for once I could accept it.Although it wasn't exactly my favourite genre, I certainly enjoyed watching ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". The acting is good and the fights are amazing. I have to admit I'm glad it won the Best Picture award, because I liked the four other nominees much more.

Certainly the best movie of 2000 !,"I have decided to buy this movie on vhs after seeing a beautiful cinematography shown in the trailer. Unfortunately this motion picture were not playing in our cinemas, so at the time when I see it at my home VCR it has already won 4 Oscars. As I have expected before buying, it would be an action with some dose of drama. Well, I must tell you that after seeing first 30 minutes of this movie I have been almost disappointed. Of course I admit that these fighting scenes are more than revolutionary, but there is that dramatically fullness what I have hope for? And in the end - is this movie worth that Oscars?  Thanks God, the second part of it proved that Crouching Tiger worth every Oscar of 2001's ceremony! Exception : Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat. Their weak performance is the only reason why I give it 9 out of 10. Because of them this movie has not become a masterpiece. I'm truly sorry  That was a negative side. Here is a positive : Zhang Ziyi and Chang Chen are one of the best screen couples in the history ! Tan Dun's music is clear magic ! Peter Pau's cinematography is like a wonderful dream ! Ang Lee's directing is excellent ! The ending sequence is really heartbreaking! All this things make me to watch this film again and again so I have see it more than 15 times. It happens with me very seldom, actually only few movies make me so exciting , so if you like Crouching Tiger I can recommend them to you .

The price of fame,"Surely, the name of the director (in this case the quite intelligent and productive, in an artistic way, Ang Lee) gives some credit to a film. He adds - if I may say so - surplus value.Accepting this, though, does not necessary suggest that a poor excuse of an art film, should  be called a ""masterpiece"". This is the situation here, with Ang's ""Crouching Tiger, hidden Dragon"".The plot? Childish. Kindergarten morals (same as in Spielberg's films) simplistic emotions and overreacting wannabe heroes.  A rather boring story without any particular value for any intelligent viewer.The acting? Well, reminded me of the good ole '60's or '50's films - too theatrical, too ""over the edge"" for the refined taste of an audience who has seen something beyond Hollywood blockbusters and bad Hong Kong action films.The cinematography? Oh, right. Here I couldn't say anything. Simply, perfect. Beautifully filmed, this story wouldn't make for a 1/10 film if it wasn't for the great director.The effects/fight scenes: Good lord, these are for 12 year olds - and even that's too old! Nothing more to say about those, just one thing: At the first scene (on the rooftops... or above them) I started laughing out loud - actually in a 400 seat theatre, about two dozen people started laughing as well.  Absolutely justified laugh, don't you think so?The Film in general?  A fairy tale, who begs us to accept it as an art movie - and fails blatantly. Only some ""hype"" and mainstream critics, or some guys who'd love anything coming from the east carrying the label of ""art movie"" are enthusiastic about it. And that shows us that the worst critic to a movie is the one who makes a living out of it - the film just had to be promoted.So, if you haven't watched it, you better forget it.

I doubt most people went to see it because they heard the plot was good...but it is.  In general, it's a very nicely written and acted film, with a sort of mythological or fairy tale feel to it that few films have managed to put on screen successfully.  There's a sort of art to everything...even the fights, while brutal at times, are always fluid and dance-like. There are a few problems.  First, the fact that the fights are dance-like, while making them beautiful in some ways, also removes some of the emotional impact of the battle in others.  Some of the battles come off more as martial arts exhibitions than actual life-or-death struggles, which can take away from the enjoyment of the film and emotion of the plot.  Some parts of the plot are a bit simplistic, as well, and just could've been more intricate, more involving.

Rent RED SORGHUM Instead,"I didn't like CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (on video, dubbed in English). It looked really good, and I'm sure if I'd seen the non-dubbed version, it would have been more dramatic, but otherwise it didn't do anything for me at all.  The scene where they're fighting in the trees, supposedly one of the highlights, seemed silly to me.  After the first couple of fight scenes, I began fast-forwarding through the rest of them.  I'm sure for some people, the way the characters floated around like Superman and all that was magical, but to me it just looked like a bunch of people swinging around on suspension wires.  The effect didn't work for me at all.  I've heard people talk about how exciting the action is and the sweeping drama of the story, but the story fell flat for me too; I wasn't into it for a second.  I found it predictable and not at all engaging (this might have been different had I not seen the dubbed version).  The photography was excellent, lots of pretty scenes, but that wasn't enough to keep me interested; I was bored through the whole thing, and by the time the ending came around, which I didn't think was much of an ending, I just didn't care.  When it was over I said, ""That's it?"" Something happens to one of the main characters in the end, but you *know* the character will be back for the sequel (or prequel, whichever one they're going to make). I think if this movie doesn't grab you from the start with the fantastic way the characters literally move and jump around, it never will.  This time next week I doubt I'll remember anything about it.I know I'm in the minority, but really, beyond all the nice pretty pictures of the mountains and the trees, etc., I wasn't engaged by this film at all. I know most people seem to love it, but there will be others who will wonder what all the fuss is about.If you want to watch a beautifully photographed, engaging and dramatic film from China, pick up RED SORGHUM; it clashes the fantastic with reality in a way CROUCHING TIGER never even approaches.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Laughable. This film's popularity is utterly inexplicable.,"It's difficult to articulate how baffled I am by the masses who adore this film.The incoherent plot doddered along with a total lack of consistency.  Case in point; a character is introduced mid-way through the movie whose presence is then explained by a terribly disconcerting, twenty minute long flashback. I have never studied film as an art, but I suspect this sort of editing is frowned upon in introductory level classes. Nor was this interjected explanation part of an overall, well thought through scheme (See Pulp Fiction) but rather an ineptly written hole that had to be plugged with some sort of (very strained) explanation. When the flashback ended I had pretty much forgotten about the ""main"" movie and really couldn't have cared less about the final resolution.The special effects are closer to an elementary school play that hoists a flailing Peter Pan in the air than they are to those found in other, more competent films. Where this movie struggles most to succeed is its biggest failure, it will forever be poor cousin to the Matrix.The attempts at comedy do elicit laughter, but you find yourself laughing at the actors and not the jokes. The crude humor juxtaposed with the film's obvious effort to achieve success as a piece of art is painful to watch.I could go on, but I think I've made my point. Please don't spend money on this movie and encourage other producers to create films such as this that lure people to the box office that aren't willing to completely suspend disbelief (and in fact beat their disbelief into a pulp and lock it in a box and run far, far away) and arrogantly expect the writer/director/producer to have created a competent product.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

The choreography, costumes, direction, music, and story are amazing and stand as a testament to good film making. When this came out I was younger and some of the themes flew right by me. As an older adult the movie resonates more, especially the restrictions when it comes to a women's role in society. Of course, this is a martial arts film, but it's much more than that and the story speaks to the larger themes. Definitely recommend if you haven't seen it, and if you have then now is the time for a rewatch.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
CTHD stands out if you classify it as a martial art film,"The success of CTHD has proved Ang Lee's ability of tailoring people of different tastes. In the form, CTHD has spectacular landscape, breathtaking fight scene, well-balanced story plot including the reserved and heart-wrenching romance between the two leading characters.Sure it has many more. Many take it as a martial art film, but definitely it is not your typical fast-food Kung-fu flick. It goes beyond many other action movies and has deep touch of the principle, morality and philosophy of Chinese Kung-fu. CTHD has sent us the message that gaining superior strength and power like kung-fu is important but how to use the power is far more important.It is not easy to produce a film that can not only deliver aesthetic entertainment but also provide room for audience to give deep thought about the nature of human being and their activities. CTHD supplies us a banquet, which can be enjoyed at different levels.No, CTHD is not pure Kung-fu movie, it is a classic of its own kind.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointingly Silly,"Considering that at the moment IMDb users' rating of this movie is 12th best of all time, I was expecting a lot; I've rarely gone into a film with so positive an attitude.  Yes, the fight scenes are easily the best I've ever seen, but there really wasn't much more to it than that.  I was willing the story to do something unexpected, or to be different from that which seems so standard for this kind of film - the master who wants to stop fighting his enemy, the apprentice who won't listen, etc.  All pretty cliched really, but that's not necessarily a negative point!  Because nothing happened that surprised me, it struggled to hold my interest; but thank goodness for those fight scenes!!  Some of the cinematography is quite beautiful, and the action direction is splendid, but unfortunately the emotional bits (like a ""good"" character dying) often just came off as funny.  And what is that flying stuff all about?!  That pushes a story attempting to be at least slightly serious over the edge into downright silly!  (It did look quite cool though.)Overall, fairly good fun, quite amusing (both intentionally and unintentionally), a little slow in places, and a lot silly.  Definitely not the 12th best film of all time, though - sorry.  6/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Masterpiece of movie-making,"I don't know if this movie was originated as a myth or a fairy tale, or is an original screenplay, but it doesn't matter.  Its a gorgeous movie which is never boring and has the feel of an epic love story. With that comes the struggle to be open to love, so anyone can identify with the insecurities and doubts that the movie shows you.  The battle scenes are like a dream where you are flying, just beautiful, mind-bendingly so.Michelle Yeoh is a great actress.  You can read her very easily.  The great Chow Yun Fat is just as good but Yeoh owns the movie and is its heart and soul.Ang Lee seems to own every genre he works in.

So I never saw it until it came on cable, and even then only when there was little else on.

If you can ignore the horrific events depicted and either don't understand or care about the film's disdain for the realities of physics, anatomy, or medical science, then this movie might be for you.Unfortunately, I have the handicaps of both education and conscience and therefore expect more from a film than a stylized adrenalin rush.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic,"It's taken me this long to finally watch this. Oh, I've known about it for like a decade, but only now that I am in love with Ang Lee did I finally seek it out. What a fantastic film. Lee is the master here, his directing giving us some of the finest fighting sequences I think I have ever seen. The story is solid, as is the writing, but it's Ang Lee's vision and beautiful markings behind the camera that give this that extra boost. It's a truly fantastic experience, mesmerizing and captivating. And because I haven't seen any of the other martial arts fantasies that have come out because of this, it's pretty original in the films I've seen.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
About Jen's Love and Growing Up,"In terms of love, I think for Jen true companionship happens when two people want the same thing. It's not something people should have eternal and constant in life; it's something fluid, and she is fluid in her being. Her actions are an embodiment of her determination; she always know what she want to do and where she want to be. If you happens to be at that same place then maybe she will love you, but in a way that no more she loves herself, because to her love is a road, just like everything else in life, whose destination is the possibility of living her life the way she wants. In other words, her love and happiness lies in being, not in having.In terms of growing up: We women all find ourselves victims and sometimes accessories of patriarchy, but only some of us are blessed enough to be able to commit matricide early in life. For the less fortunate, the biggest enemy has always been the father, and only after mentally or in some occasions physically eliminating the paternal figure can we progress in our journey of finding peace with our femininity. This is certainly the case for Yu Shu Lien, someone that has been living in not only the repressive society but also the patriarchal prison of her own mind. The subject of her conversations with others is never herself; it's always about her father, Li Mu Bai, or patronizing traditional values when it comes to Jen. It took Li Mu Bai's life for her to stop justifying the repression she received. This is a realization of patricide for Yu Shu Lien, as well as a a moment of matricide for Jen. Jen in comparison is one of the blessed; she had her patricide a long time ago, ever since she became a protégés of Jade Fox, whose ""craziness"" and franticness has been contributed by Wutang's institutional rejection of women. So for Jen finding her place in the world is dictated mainly by the defeat of the maternal superiority.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stunning beauty and artful direction,"The film ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" follows an interesting plot line set in ancient China of honour, love, and heroism.I find it to be one of the visually most stunning films from the 2000s, with smooth direction, costume design, choreography, and especially the director of photography does a stunning job og conveying the beauty of China through stunning and complex cinematography.I will recommend this in terms of story as well. Also it has some more subtle choices of conveying emotion that I was really fond of. The film provides an in-depth view into the China of the past. But I found the film's biggest strength to be its tale of quiet romance. The heartfelt sophistication of the main characters' love for each other was deeply touching to see unfold.I will highly recommend the film, especially if your local cinema has a viewing of it on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Brilliant ****/****,"CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON is a captivating film in many aspects. The film creates a unique universe that the viewer becomes involved in, from watching the film. The universe created in CROUCHING TIGER is one of traditional virtues and values, but also one of harmony, but unbelievably well-done fighting sequences at the same time. The beauty of CROUCHING TIGER is that nothing is forced, -even the fighting sequences are the right amount of time- the story and plot flow perfectly. The continuity, cinematography, and acting performances enhance the effect of CROUCHING TIGER's unique universe.Prior to viewing CROUCHING TIGER, I envisioned an overrated Chinese action flick, similar to a Jackie Chan movie, with a little more seriousness, and countless action sequences with cool special effects that lasted too long and subtitles. I was fortunately surprised to discover that my initial judgment was proved wrong. The action sequences where Li Mu Bai and Jen Yu fly and glide are absolutely amazing. These scenes capture the spiritual meditation of the CROUCHING TIGER universe. Although these action sequences are fighting scenes, each scene has a graceful spiritual feel to it; this is enhanced by the serene cello solos of Yo-Yo Ma. The fight scene on the treetops between Li Mu Bai and Jen Yu was particularly brilliant in its execution. The cinematography eloquence of this scene produced breathtaking experience.The acting performances delivered by Chow-Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, and Ziyi Zhang were spectacular. The power, nobleness, and honor of Li Mu Bai's character was successfully expressed through Chow-Yun-Fat's great performance. The beautiful Michelle Yeoh also delivers as Li Mu Bai's close friend and ally, as she gives a strong and emotional performance. Ziyi Zhang plays the young and fiery Jen Yu, who is searching to find her real self. The emotions and aura's projected by each character more than make up for the film's subtitles. In fact the Chinese language heightens the film's effect on the viewer, as the viewer need not pay attention to the words, but the flow and emotional quality of the dialogue.CROUCHING TIGER did not have one wasted scene. Each and every second was enjoyable as the next. For all the uniqueness of the film, it in many ways tells the story of a typical adolescent girl and her quest for true identity and self trust and discovery, but in abstract ways. Jen is like many teenage girls: worrying about whether she is with the right man, adopting a rude and fiery attitude and temper, and committing juvenile acts such as stealing and running away from home. Jen's story is in many ways a rite of passage as she goes from being a kind and polite aristocrat's daughter to being the Dark Cloud's mistress in the wild desert, to working and training with the evil Jade Fox, to taking lessons from Li Mu Bai and making friends with Bai's close friend, Shu Lien.Jen's experimentation with various people and lifestyles is like experimenting with drugs and alcohol. She had exiting intense experiences with each experimentation, but at the film's conclusion she finds her true self, and what she was meant to be, and who she was meant to be with. I will not reveal Jen's final conclusions, as to not ruin the ending.All in all CROUCHING TIGER is a masterfully crafted film, definitely worthy of every second of its 120 minutes.CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON ****/****",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great Movie, But Ending Lacked","Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. It had great fight scenes and a great plot for the man to get his lost love back and a new one forming between Li Mui Bi, and the other fighter woman.  What I felt the film's down spots were, was when there was too much detail on how the princess and lo met, and the flying was a little but exagerated.  Plus, I hated the ending. Chow You Fat dies, and then the princess jumps off of the edge and flies away leaving her love behind?  It made no sense.  The whole movie spends time trying to develop a romance between Chow Yun Fat and the other woman, and then he dies before it gets a chance to take off.  Overall I gave the movie a 7 out of 10.  It had great fight scenes, and a lot of great special effects. However, the story was a bit slow at times and the ending sucked.  It is deffinately not the best movie ever, but a good one all the same.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Worth seeing, but...not everybody's cup of tea","I left this film feeling disappointed.  It is not a bad film by any means, but it does not live up to the media hype, in my opinion.  I adore Asian films, and also love fantasy films.  This was both, but somehow was not very satisfying.It seems that the biggest disappointment was the loosely constructed story that left lots of things unexplained.  Well, that has happened with other good films.  Somehow it didn't work in this one.The heroine of the story, Jen, was not a very heroic figure.  Usually she came across as a spoiled brat.  This would have been o.k. for a while if it were possible to tell WHY she had this huge chip on her shoulder.  A point was made that she was rebelling against the traditional woman's role in her culture.  That concept could have carried her story in a much stronger way if it had been explored in depth.  But it wasn't...Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh did some awsome acting in this film.  I also loved the special effects and the fight scenes.If you want to see a good Chinese film, see Farewell, My Concubine; Raise the Red Lantern; or any other film directed by Chen Kaige or Zhang Yimou.  A great (animated) Asian fantasy film is Princess Mononoke.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A faithful heart makes wishes come true.,"Li Mu Bai (Yun-Fat Chow): I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath that I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side as a condemned soul, than enter heaven without you. Because of your love, I will never be a lonely spirit.It should come as no surprise to anyone who glances at my reviews that I am in love with actors like Chow Yun-Fat (Curse of the Golden Flower, Pirates 3), Michelle Yeoh (Jet Li's Fearless, Tomorrow Never Dies), and Ziyi Zhang (2046, Memoirs of a Geisha ). To have all three in an absolutely beautiful film with Oscar-winning art and set decoration, cinematography, and music, is a rare thrill.Director Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain) created a masterpiece. This film, and that other great film of 2000, Gladiator, took turns picking up statues at the 2001 Academy Awards.

Pretty story,"Quite untypical martial arts movie, but still there were some elements which should have been reconsidered. First those flying scenes above the roofs were nothing but credible. Then those intimate scenes were quite compromised, which is never positive, between ""PG"" and ""R"" ratings.

You people must be idiots!,"I usually don't do this, but this is the second time to write a comment on this movie for me. The first review, I gave it a horrible rating and I'm not changing it. I didn't give enough detail in the first review. But come on people, does it deserve an 8.6 rating? Give me a break! It was such a bore! The plot was thinner than a sheet of paper. It was so dumb ad pointless. You've seen the same plots and similar ones in other movies and you trashed those. The 3 Ninja series is better than this. It's such a waste of time and money. This actually should actually be on the bottom 100 instead of the top 250. There is quite a few movies that can replace this for the 250 movies.

"Excellent Action, Beautiful Drama","Now that wire work is pretty standard in American film, it is hard to remember how impressive the effects were in the Matrix. Though the Matrix was hardly the first to use that type of effect, Asian cinema had been doing it for awhile, it was the first time I had seen anything like it. I remember being completely awed by the look and movement of the film. Though much of the style and effects quickly became vamped by many films, shows, and commercials, it remained perfect in its visual effects. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon came out a few months later and pushed the Matrix visual envelope even farther. For my dollar, Ang Lee created a smarter, more beautiful use for the effects than the Wachowski brothers ever dreamed of creating.The story is a bit tricky. A master martial artists, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat), decides to give up his heroism and settle down. Proving his seriousness in this new direction he gives up his famed sword, the Green Destiny, to a friend. The sword is quickly stolen throwing Li Mu Bai and another friend, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) into detective work to reclaim it. Added to the plot is a noble woman, Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang), about to be married against her wishes and Li's old nemesis Jade Fox (Pei-Pei Chang). To add a little more to the plot (I told you it was tricky) Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien are lovers destined to never have their loved fulfilled.Ang Lee manages to sort out this complicated plot rather smoothly. The film is sumptuously shot on location in China. The renowned action sequences are poetic and beautiful. It feels more like watching ballet than a sword-fighting action movie. The more skilled fighters can climb up walls, jump great heights and seemingly fly through the sky. Though the film never explains how they are able to manage such incredible feats, they do it with such agility and grace, that you never think to question it. There is a scene fought out amongst tall whisp trees that is pure poetry. Yet they action sequences never stand in the way of the story. This is not a film designed to wow the audience with nothing but visual tricks, the action serves the story alone and is not there to give cheap thrills.As the film unfolds a theme develops. Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lin never express their love for each other out of honor and loyalty. They hold to strict codes that must be obeyed over all of their own desires. Jen Yu is also bound by codes of conduct, but she chooses to disobey them and strives to live her own life. This serves as the central conflict between the characters. I will not give too much of the plot away, but will say that film concludes this conflict in manner not seen often in cinema.It is difficult for me to judge the acting of a foreign film. I choose only to watch the original language, with subtitles. This allows me to hear the nuances of the actors voices, but since I must rely on the subtitles to tell me what they are saying it is difficult to really judge a performance. That being said all of the actors do a fine job. Chow Yun Fat does a remarkable job as a master fighter. Each action scene he is in he fill the screen with a knowing presence. He fights with great poise as if he knows he will be the victor, but does not want to show his true ability. Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang are also stand outs.My only complaint has to do with one of the sub-plots. In the middle of the picture, we get a long back story on part of Jen Yu's life. After watching the film again I can see that the back story is essential to the overall theme of the film, but it is still too long in the telling. It also serves to slow the film down just as the plot was finally moving along. I believe the essentials of the back story could have been told at a quicker pace allowing us to understand what is needed without slowing the pace of the film down, or lengthening it too much.This is a small complaint with a truly wonderful film. I have been a fan of Ang Lee for many years, and this film stands as his finest achievement. He is known for his smaller, character driven family films. Here he manages to achieve something on a more grander scale, yet maintains a beautifully portrayed character drama.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The beginning of a new era for Wuxia films.,"When I first saw this movie, I was utterly blown away. I had never seen anything like it before...just a remarkable conglomeration of many different movie genres; comedy, romance, action, mystery and martial arts film. And the truly amazing thing was that this movie did all of these things well. Since I saw this movie, I have explored the genre fairly extensively; I have watched some of the contemporary films, like Hero, House of Flying Daggers; some other slightly older films, like Ashes of Time and the Bride with White Hair; and some of the classics, like Touch of Zen, Come Drink with Me, and Golden Swallow. And of all of these films, the oldest are the ones that still compare well with this, particularly Touch of Zen, in which one can really see the roots of this movie (highly recommended). Anyways, getting back to the movie; I won't spoil the plot, but Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat are fantastic in their roles, as they simply display perfect emotion for their situation. Zhang Ziyi is outstanding in her role as a feisty young woman who is unwilling to bend to her parent's wishes. And Chang Pei-pei, in a small role as the Jade Fox, is outstanding, a nod from And Lee to her early classics (Golden Swallow, Come Drink with Me). When I watched this movie, I felt that the cinematography and choreography put me into a dreamlike state that made me even more willing to accept all of the ideas and themes that this movie presents. An enjoyable experience worth watching if you just saw Hero or House of Flying Daggers but missed this one.

"Absolutely excellent performances, but not as great as hailed","Too many people have been hailing this movie as one of the best, most inspiring, uplifting stories that they have ever been intro duced to. Well, the acting was 4 star worthy, absolutely perfect. However, the action scenes, as entertaining as they were, were too obviously Matrix-produced. The scenes were also EXTREMELY unrealistic in some cases. No, not the end, which was supposed to be ""mystical,"" but the scene in which Chow-Yun Fat and the selfish young girl jump out of the three story building (WITHOUT A TOUCHING A WALL)and ""fly"" across a lake (only touching the surface once, I might add) absolutely disgusted me. Yet, it was compensated for in the beautiful, breathtaking tree scene. Also, the part where the governor's daughter wipes out a sleaze filled restaurant was so poorly done, with overwhelming slapstick you would find in a jackie chan crossover-American movie. You'd think you were watching ""Rush Hour"" or ""Shanghai Noon,"" which were entertaining in a different sense. This film had the most beautiful scenery I have ever seen. The end featured the devastatingly haunting battle in the swaying trees, the utopian melodious echoes of the cascading river, and best of all the very end featured the Wu-something mountain.

This is a movie with a well told story that has some amazing sword fight choreography going for it. The movie is about fates intertwining, romance that doesn't go over the top, and of course fighting. But the unfolding of the story and how everything plays out was just so darn fantastically paced. It was captivating from the start to finish, just to see how everything plays out. Even the drama aspect of this movie is the right amount. It has won awards for good reason. Not just because of the storytelling, but because of the acting, cinematography and choreography which is just well shot. Especially for a movie that came out in 2000. I think this is probably the first big Chinese movie to make it to the big screen in the US and leave an impact. Do I think this movie is a bit over-hyped? Yeah, it isn't a groundbreaking movie.

Of course, the actions and scenes of the duel and the culture with cold weapons are also very realistic.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Good, not great","If you're looking for a good kung-fu action pic with some elements of story and character development which you don't normally find in a kung-fu action pic, see Crouching Tiger.  But if you're expecting a great story, you may be disappointed.  The fight scenes are definitely spectactular, and the much-heralded bending of the laws of gravity is neat (if overused), but DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO BE AN EMOTIONALLY INVOLVING MOVIE.  It's just not.  The acting is good, but the story does not let you into the minds of any of these characters.  The one exception is the 20-30 minute Flashback In The Desert, where young Jen resists and eventually falls in love with the roguish loner guy.  That was compelling storytelling.  But essentially there's not much else to the story.  I didn't buy the romance between Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat, and without spoiling the ending, I think that this storyline, and the whole movie, ended quite unsatisfyingly.  Maybe certain things don't translate from East to West very well, but I couldn't help but think that this is yet another lesson in Don't Believe The Hype.  8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nicely Filmed.,This was a beautifully photographed film.  Many scenes are haunting and stay with you afterwards.  I found the story rather romantically juvenile not unlike other Chinese martial arts films.  The fight scenes were nicely choreographed and had a supernatural quality to them.  I felt the flying was a bit much.  The need to have heroes fly must be in some collective subconscious.  In the west we have Superman; in the East they have martial arts masters.  I enjoyed the movie despite the almost silly story.  Martial art movies do have some fun bad guys.  Jade Fox was a memorable villain.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Crouching mess hidden movie,"This movie like ""The Blair Witch Project"" shows the power of what in advertising lingo is known as ""The Bandwagon Effect"".

Well, I refuse to follow the lemmings to the sea.This movie was pretentious and boring. And no metaphor can excuse the sword dancing via wires on the tree tops(silly).My advice.

Exaggeratedly overrated,"The only thing that sets this movie apart from the rest of the Kung Fu flicks is its esthetic pretentions. You have to admit that the photography is quite astonishing and the actors do a pretty good job, too. But those are the only positive comments I can make about it.There's nothing truly original in the storyline and once you've seen the characters do their ""flying nun"" stunts once, it becomes pretty silly and redundant afterwards.In short, all through the movie you keep looking for a sign of what it is that made this movie to be praised by so many people.In that genre, Chinese Ghost Stories was far more better and, at least, it had a sense of humor. I'm sure Ang Lee is very talented but it's totally wasted here.Rating: 4/10",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Perfection in story, sound, and visuals","This film lacks nothing.  It's story is tight, smart, and well-written.  It is smooth and soft and flows quite evenly.  There are few questions left unanswered and it seems that questioning only adds to the experience.Ang Lee is a true master of the art of film and uses many subtle techniques to forebode.  For example, the reflection of Jen and Jade Fox during a conversation early on.Any comment on how 'real' the film is is absolutely ungrounded.  The story is, in a sense, a folktale on the mythology of ancient China.  When one enters the film knowing the background, the flying and fighting became less unreal and more spectacular and seamless.

But best to MHO is still the cinematography. The atmosphere which is created by the way of shooting is superb. By creatively choosing the angles to shoot a scene makes it a pleasure to watch, without even following the story.

"Generally enjoyable, but surprising it does well in America","I have to admit, I'm surprised this movie is so popular in America. It's a very non-Occidental flick. I enjoyed it, however. There was a deep passionate romance, and a more restrained one. I typically found the main characters interesting.My main problems is that _some_ of the flying/fighting sequences did look rather weird, particularly early on. When the defiance of gravity is used in conjunction with martial arts, it is excellent. When it's simply characters pointing their arm out Superman-style and flying through the air it looks a bit goofier.Also, the desert flashback in the middle does tend to drag on a bit, bringing the movie to a grinding halt after about ten minutes.But generally I enjoyed the various characters and found the plot engaging enough. There isn't really one ""central"" plot, and I'm not convinced they intermesh the various threads as well as they could have. Still, I would recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Jon Monsarrat review:  Chinese saga, accessible and powerful","""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is too first appearances, a little silly. Martial artists are flying around and doing stunts that bear no resemblance to what a real human could do, even exaggerated. One of my buddies even said the film should be renamed ""Flying People, Hidden Wires"".But it's clear in the story that what we're viewing is a Chinese myth, heroic and saga-like. So all of that power and bombast fits well without becoming comic or cheesy. In fact, the movie is surprisingly accessible and powerful, and not at all to be categorized with pure action films -- although you could watch it as a pure action film if you didn't feel particularly deep that day.It was more than an engaging film with plenty of action. I felt like I learned something about Chinese culture. While the film doesn't exactly have ""something to say that might change your life"", it is certainly moving.Who should see this film:-- everyone, safe for both drama types and action film types,if you are ever going to see a film like this, this is the one!I'll give ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" an 8 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

May the Qi be with you!,"I first saw this movie at the cinema when I was about 12 years old. It was the first time I witnessed this type of movie. I instantly loved it; it captured my attention even before the first fighting scene. At that age I was pretty naive, but it's interesting the fact that I was not very surprised when I saw people flying around. My subconscious dictated me that it's something natural in those type of movies, with a certain type of philosophy, and in certain parts of the globe. I loved the introspective ending too.
Everything in this movie is perfectly balanced - the fighting scenes, the relationship between characters, the plot, the drama, the romance.
Already a classical modern martial arts movie.

Not that good!  Can't believe all the hype.,"The fight scenes are so ridiculous. Every scene revolves around setting up the next showdown. Michelle Yeoh has a great screen presence that is wasted. The movie has very little character development. The relationship between Michelle and Chow is not explored enough. Also,  there is a twenty minute side story in the middle of how Zhang Ziyi's charachter met a rebel and fell in love with him.  When they get back to the main story they barely touch the relationship between the two young stars.  Instead they have Zhang beating up a bar full of men to wow the audience.  I guess I am the only one who doesn't have this on my top ten list.  Almost Famous and Wonder Boys are much better films that develop there characters.  I didn't hate this movie, I just went into it with higher expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I Must Disagree,"Dorian said on February 14, 2002 that ""Some people have bashed this film because of the plot's impossibilities, and the impossibility of people flying, and jumping as high and as graceful as the characters in this film can.GROW UP!!! Yeah, that's right - GROW. UP. For the two simple reasons1) It's a bloody film!! 2) Ever heard of the expression 'suspension of disbelief'?!"" ------------------------------------I expected a better argument from an English person.  #1 - you want us to like the film because it's a film.  That isn't a very persuasive argument.#2 - you expect us to ""suspend our disbelief"" without a reason.  Walking into a movie theater is not enough to suspend disbelief.  If I'm watching an animated Disney cartoon, I can suspend my belief when a mouse talks.  The movie Babe was about animals talking to each other - fine I can accept that and move on.  Star Wars starts off the whole movie by saying ""In a galaxy far, far away.."" Great, laser swords and Jedi Knights exist their.  In all of these areas I can easily suspend disbelief.But I can't suspend disbelief when watching Arnold Schwarzenneger in Commando, somehow dodging 50 submachine guns firing on him from forty feet away.  Why you ask?  Because the movie based itself in reality, the other movies clearly tell you up front that this is fantasy.  Crouching Tiger tried to be a martial arts/romance movie and as a serious movie never explained how people fly through the air.  This movie would have been better if they started it off with some old monks reading some ancient book that explained how the great ancestors could tap into some hidden powers.Why didn't they do that?  Because then it becomes a fantasy movie which stuffy critics choose to hate.  Critics like yourself who probably have never seen Conan the Barbarian or Lord of the Rings.  Mark my words, here in writing, Lord of the Rings does NOT win best picture, even though 37,000+ people have given it the highest rating of any movie ever made in the history of mankind.Oh, and by the way, Lord of the Rings takes place in an ancient pre-civilization world where elves and hobbits exist.

Fight film with a heart: pure poetry,"As an American and having grown up in a society that I don't particularly care for, I've always been fascinated with other cultures, belief systems, and ways of life.  I find it a lot more easy to suspend my belief when the subject matter addresses things I don't live with every day, things that I can really appreciate.CTHD does possess a high level of absurdity, it does have less of an excuse to have the characters participate in physics-defying battles than say the Matrix, and it does take me awhile to get used to the English-dub not quite matching up with the lip movement . . . but frankly, I don't care.The thing I appreciate most about this film is the fact that the plot is not a flimsy excuse to make characters enter combat every chance they get; it takes the time to develop their characters and setting and fully embrace the world it creates for us.  We have wonderful character and plot arcs, and an interesting unspoken understanding exists between the three main characters played by Yeoh, Yun-fat, and Zhang . . . then it goes even further by extending it to lesser characters.  Now we don't have cardboard clichés battling it out on screen . . . now we have characters that can and do communicate on multiple levels, and now we have some depth and reason to care.Their interactions aren't played out to be 100% realistic, rather, it's surreal and poetic which provides a perfect foundation for the glorious fight scenes.  Fight scenes that carry more meaning than simply to kill or beat the other guy.  In Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, fights are used as tools to advance the plot and develop the characters, and more than mere blows are exchanged . . . a lot more seems to transpire in the combat photographed here.  My personal favorite would be as Li Mu Bai uses a twig to give lessons in swordplay; all the movements and all of his back story lead up to paint the portrait of an eternally calm master warrior, fighting to teach and not to kill.And I have to bring up Tan Dun's wonderful score, which provides one of the best utilizations of the cello I've heard in film (compliments, of the extremely talented Yo-yo Ma).  It's a very moving instrumental and like the film, itself, carries an array of seemingly contradicting emotions.  It doesn't strive to sound sad here--upbeat there--happy here--like a number of lesser scores.  Tan Dun surpasses that primitive impulse in every way imaginable by writing music that requires true emotional exploration.  I just hope more directors turn to Tan Dun to provide their films with his music . . . .I love Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and I applaud Ang Lee for this film as well am very glad to see the Oscars recognized it for 4 awards and several nominations.

Zhang & Yeoh's acting combination, the beautiful location sceneries, fight choreography (and real kung-fu), graceful cinematography, score (Tan Dun) and a wonderful sense of romantic helplessness all blend in so beautifully to give an unforgettable movie worthy of multiple viewing enjoyment for a long time to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A nuanced gem of storytelling structure,"A few superb films are so carefully made that every shot seems to have its own story to tell.This film goes all of them one better -- nearly every frame seems to have a life of its own, and a carefully thought out reason for being part of this remarkable epic.It is a rare event in film to see such discipline that its characters' every subtle movement falls into the effortless rhythm of the camera and editing while also propelling the story forward.  The more closely you watch this film, the better it gets.  It is crafted with a seemingly superhuman attention to detail.The lengthy, structurally audacious flashback serves as close counterpoint to the consistently extraordinary scene settings and several first-order cinematographic coups involving the synthesis of other-worldly beauty through framing and digitally clarified color.And it's not just art -- some of the fight scenes and a few clever shots so quick you better not blink are outright fun!OK, I admit it.  As a sincere lifelong cinema addict, I've maintained a very short list of ""the best films ever made"" since I saw ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" on my 10th birthday, the day it premiered in New York.  I didn't understand ""2001"" that day, and I'm certain I don't fully grasp ""Crouching Tiger"" in 2001.But ""Crouching Tiger"" has an unassailable place on that short list.Anyone who enjoys movies as movies must not lose the opportunity to see a good print of this in a good projection facility.

This is a true classic,"So Hotpot thinks the flying loses the film its serious edge? Since when did it have to be serious? He is clearly not familiar with the concept of the Wudan stories. Crouching Tiger (Or Wo hu zang long) is the fairy tale equivalent of the Matrix. Just as Matrix operates within sci-fi conventions, this film operates within Wudan principles. If you aren't prepared to accept the conventions of this film (ie the flying), you won't enjoy it. I myself was totally immersed in a film of pure character. Each fight sequence has an emotional level beyond the powerful choreography of The Matrix. Unlike MI2, this advances flo mo rather than using it as another cinematic device.

Jackie Chan meets Peter Pan,"This is a good film that fails to live up to the hype (a common phenomenon). There are many elements of the film that are superlative in this martial arts fantasy, but director Ang Lee can't seem to commit to a theme for the story causing it to meander aimlessly from one fight scene to the next.  The film is remarkable in the fact that women play a prominent role, a marked departure from the second class status of women in eastern societies.  Yet, Ang even hedges on this important point with Jen ultimately capitulating to the forces against her in an ending that is as unsatisfying as it is ambiguous.  It is almost as if he is saying, `Women are strong too, but not quite strong enough.'On the plus side, the photography and the choreography of the fight scenes are superb.  While Bruce Lee was probably the most accomplished martial arts star ever, and Jackie Chan one of the most innovative and entertaining, the choreography by Yuen Woo-ping in this film is artistry that makes ordinary actors seem like skilled elite warriors.  The use of wires in the fight scenes is incredible, creating eye popping acrobatic scenes that take the genre to a new level.Unfortunately, the wires are overused and give the film a Peter Pan quality that reduces its impact as a serious fantasy adventure (if there is such a thing).   By far, the biggest flaw of the film is the unsteadiness of the storytelling.  There are too many subthemes and Ang doesn't commit to any of them.  We have two love stories going on (Li/Yu and Jen/Lo), the theft of the Green Destiny, Li's desire to mentor Jen, Jen's relationship with Jade Fox, Jen's relationship with Yu, Jen's progress as a warrior, Jen's adventure in the desert, etc., etc.  Ang drifts from theme to theme and never ties them together effectively.  The most disconcerting of these is the overly long treatment of Jen's pursuit of Lo into the desert to get her comb back.  This was one of the longest film non sequiturs I can remember, and it didn't add that much to the main themes.The acting is excellent across the board.  Chow Yun-Fat is the most prominent actor in China and his outstanding abilities are evident here.  He renders a strong and sympathetic character that is both charismatic and dynamic.  Michelle Yeoh is an accomplished martial arts expert, who is the only female star that Jackie Chan allows to do her own stunts.  Her presence adds great credibility to the fight scenes and her dramatic performance is first rate.  Newcomer Zhang Ziyi lights up the screen as Jen with impressive athleticism in the fight sequences and strong acting skills.Overall, this is an impressively filmed adventure with a story that is too loosely wound to qualify it as a great film.  I rated it a 7/10.  It is undeniably great entertainment as its $120 million U.S. box office gross will attest.  However, mass appeal is not necessarily a good gauge of filmmaking quality (as worthless blockbusters like `Scary Movie' exemplify). Despite stunning cinematography and mind boggling action footage, CTHD lacks a compelling story, leaving all its impressive elements adrift as nothing more than extraordinary window dressing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
bedtime story for adults!,"At first, this movie does not appear impressing through our Hollywood-customed glasses. The effects lies somewhat below our expectations of a modern movie, the story line doesn't, at the first glimpse, seem to have the complexity, detail level, depth and relevance to present time that moviegoers of 2001 expect.However, this movie, in my opinion revives the essentials of movies and storytelling in general. Through a time- and factless environment, we are told a story with an unrealistic but intriguing touch. We then let our own fantasy fill the gaps, and subconsciously relates the movie to own experiences thus giving the movie a personal sense of meaning.If you start watching this movie with ""hollywood dreams"", you might easily be disappointed, but if you expect a bedtime story for adults, I'm sure you'll like this breathtaking, stunningly beautiful fairytale from afar...Please do yourself the favor to see this movie, and rediscover the child within yourself!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Feminists should like this,"I was rather surprised at the number of people who claimed not to like Crouching Tiger because of the flying and leaping. Even the best of realist martial arts films require extraordinary suspension of disbelief. No one should ever produce a gun, for instance, and often, while the hero is kicking the stuffing out of the guys in front, the guys behind are doing a kind of rhythmic shuffle, awaiting their turn. I thought the film was gloriously choreographed, like Swan Lake with attitude. But most interesting was the whole business of Jade Fox and the Zhang Ziyi character, who regularly express contempt for the Wudan style of martial arts, and make it clear that their resentment comes from the fact that women were excluded from learning there. When Jade Fox dies, she calls the Zhang Ziyi character her only family, her only enemy. Also, the bulk of the actual fighting was done by the two very acrobatic and good-looking women. And Zhang Ziyi's character is definitely easy for women to empathize with; she's like a lot of young women who don't want to marry the man their parents choose. I haven't seen enough martial arts movies to be an expert, but I don't think this sort of sensitivity to women's desires is that common. It's possible that this emphasis on women's needs (and the whole emphasis on love rather than duty) is what put off many traditional viewers. I loved it, and I only hope more martial arts movies feature women like these.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Misunderstood masterpiece,"One of the first things that every actor learns at the beginning of their path, is that any physical action is a direct result of will. This somewhat vague phrase is the real basis behind Ang Lee's new film, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, sadly misunderstood and mistaken by many to be a kung-fu or action film.The film, presented in almost lyrical form, would be hard to understand for western eyes, such as my own. I know a few people who completely misunderstood the plot, and praised the movie for its action sequences. However, as I have mentioned before, these action sequences are not to be taken as stand-alone, as sadly most action-oriented movies have been asking us to do, lately. To fully realize how wonderful this movie is, one must look at the flight of swords as a dance, brought on by the conflicting viewpoints of the two warriors, Li Mu Bai and young Jen, as the aged warrior holds a stoic taoist calmness even as his sword flickers with the speed of an arrow throughout his battles to tame the tiger.The true wisdom of the film can be discovered only by listening to the poetic lines that Yun-Fat Chow cleverly intersperses into his conversations, pearls that must be sought after. The struggle is transformed into a song which IS the movie, constructed in the same way that chinese legends had been told for ten thousand generations. The cultural gap between the west and the orient will make this task much harder to perform, but when truly deciphered, the movie takes on a completely different form.While the story itself is sung to the audience, the brilliantly coordinated fight-scenes weave it together to create a complete entity. Neither may be taken separately, otherwise the movie will lose its original meaning. I take my hat off for Hui-Ling Wang, Kuo Jung Tsai and James Schamus, for transforming the wonderful book into a screenplay, and for Ang Lee, that has made a two hour film about love, inner-strength, and the taoist way.To sum these up, I recommend to anyone who liked the movie to see it again with new eyes. Hopefully, this movie will set the way for a renewed intelligence and beauty in movies in this new century.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The parsimony of spirit amongst moviegoers,"It's bothered me for some time, the sort of superficial slagging off this movie has received from some commentators here. Having just watched it again, I feel compelled to add to my (much) earlier comments on this picture and respond to a couple of other comments.First, I would like to address the issue of plot. Some have described it as ""paper thin"" or ""cliche."" The extreme over-reliance on plot over story is the Achilles heel of many a film. I realize some people like a complicated plot, but in the language of cinema plot is a framework. Many films today -- I daresay most -- are not made in the language of cinema, and are made in the language of expository prose, including many pictures I like quite a lot. Many films have a complex and intriguing plot yet fail to tell a compelling story.My point is that the simple ""plot"" (love stories, stolen sword) and indeed the genre trappings in the picture serve as the framework for a story that is told almost exclusively visually. Almost all of the emotional punch of this tale is told visually, in cinematic language rather than clunky exposition. And what is this story about? Simply, about letting go of who you are, in the face of the fear of who you might be becoming, in order that you might become whom you need to become. The plot is simple, the story, complex and mutlifaceted.If that sounds like hokum to you, perhaps it's best that you move on to a standard chop-socky picture. Chances are you will not enjoy this rich and wonderful film.Also, I'd like to comment on the supposed ""woodenness"" of Michelle Yeoh as remarked by some negative posters. Ms. Yeoh's performance is, in my view, a tour de force. Her character has a world of things happening within, but her culture imposes restraint in so many areas, restraint eloquently expressed by Ms. Yeoh with simple gestures and expressions. It is for precisely this reason that the fight scenes between Ms. Yeoh and Ms. Xiyi have such an elemental and raw power to them. It is as if all that has been repressed is released with extraordinary focus.Finally, I would like to address two painful comments made by other posters. One opines: ""If you want to see a good plot, watch Gladiator."" ""Gladiator"" is a good example of ""all plot, no story,"" and as hackneyed and recycled plot as has been seen onscreen in many a year. It seems to have been assembled, as so many have commented, from old ""Spartacus,"" ""Fall of the Roman Empire,"" and ""Ben Hur"" screenplays. The dialogue is ludicrous and even the critical plot points dazzle in their banality. The incredibly paranoid, wimpy and unskilled Roman emperor will get into the ring with the deadliest gladiator of all time? Why? So the plot can continue to grind its way forward, clockwork-like, and the emotions of you, the viewer, can be manipulated with appallingly predictable results. Are you not entertained? And yet, what is the story about? There really is no story. Only plot.Another poster offered: ""If a movie had great special effects, but terrible acting and a paper-thin plot, the average 2000/01 moviegoer would scream about how terrible Hollywood was getting. "" Cf. my comments re: Gladiator above, and the screaming of every cineaste I know when viewing ""Pearl Harbor"" or at least 75% of the tripe that is rehashed, assembled from a kit, reheated and served up lukewarm, with a cold and manipulative calculation, to willing audiences who at least appear to lap it up.CTHD is a unique and heartfelt work that works on levels well below (and above) the superficial level of plot. That people who disdain it do so because of the ""paper-thin"" plot yet extol the virtues of ""Gladiator"" explains the ascendance of plot over story, of simplistic exposition over visual storytelling, and ultimately, the slow demise of film as a legitimate popular art form.Many people, it seems, don't want to be bothered looking below the surface, in art or indeed in their lives. They would much rather have things spelled out and spoon-fed to them. It's so much easier that way, isn't it? One doesn't have to think too much then.How we feel about art is often a good indicator of how we feel about ourselves. Are you not entertained?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best movie in a Wo hu zang long time....,"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is certainly a refreshing film for the mainstream film audience. As a regular watcher of many Hong Kong pictures, the high flying special effects and lighting fast choreography was nothing new, but it is great for regular movie-goers to experience it. In all of the times I have watched it you could hear an ovation of cheers and claps after the first fight scene.I can't wait for the DVD! (June 5th)PN",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Digging the Wudan Clan,"Martial Arts movies are coming back!  I can't remember the last time I went to a subtitled movie in a crowded theater, but the hype around Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon must be working.  A recent Saturday matinee was packed.People are going to see a film in Cantonese, but not all of them can handle it.  I heard a lady complaining that she couldn't keep up with the dialogue while we were leaving the theater.  (My nine year old son had no problems.) And there were a lot of giggles during the ethereal fight scenes. Apparently, some people can't suspend reality enough to be awed by martial artists trained in the Wudan discipline flying through the air.  (Okay, it looks kind of silly in print, but it works.)I went to see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon with very high expectations. Most of the movie reviewers I read have it on their Best of 2000 lists.  I liked the movie very much, especially Peter Pau's cinematography, but I wish I'd gone into the film knowing a little less about it.It's a gorgeous movie with great acting.  Anyone who fell in love with Chun Yow Fat in The King and I will enjoy his Li Mu Bai.  He is the moral center who grounds the story of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.But, the real surprise is the strength of the female characters in the film. Director Ang Lee seems to gravitate toward projects with strong female leads, and that's why his movies will continue to stand out.  In my opinion, the two best fight scenes in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon are staged between two women, and they are phenomenal.  Audiences are reacting to martial arts moves and cheering that girls are kicking butt.  That made me happy, as I've studied martial arts for over four years.Michelle Yeoh (Yu Shu Lien) is a great role model for girls.  She has dignity and manners, grace under fire and a knowledge of weapons!  Chen Chang (Lo) and Ziyi Zhang (Jen) are both wonderful actors who bring a youthful energy and at times much needed comic relief to the movie.Yes, there's comedy and tragedy and a story and a very powerful sword all set in beautiful China surroundings.  I worry that if Ang Lee has started a trend, that the future movies with martial arts will not bother with anything beyond action.  For now though, get to this trendsetter, if you think you can handle it.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is rated PG-13 for martial arts violence and some sexuality.  And you need have the ability and desire to read the dialogue.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon earns 4 stars on my scale, 0-5.  It's stylish and subtitled, raising the bar for foreign films and leap kicking over it with jaw dropping action.  The best part is that the questions of who is the Crouching Tiger and who is the Hidden Dragon are open for debate.  Buddha's name be praised.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, but disappointing as well","After seeing many strange phantasy, martial arts and other bizarre films from Asia, I was really looking forward to seeing Crouching Tiger. The first of its kind in years to become a box office hit in both the US, and Europe. How could it go wrong, especially with Chow Yun Fat in the lead?Well, it doesn't go wrong, but unfortunately it doesn't live up to it's expectations as well. First of all: There really are many many much better similar films from Hong Kong. Second of all: I got a little bit tired with all the explanations that were given for the action. Ang Lee must have really presumed that none of the viewers had ever seen a martial arts film. And finally: Chow Yun Fat is still as charismatic as ever, but somehow he doesn't reach the level, that he did in (for instance) his John Woo films.The best part of the film are the female leads. Both actresses are great! And of course, the action-scenes were good as well. But, I would recommend (for instance) a film like Heroic Trio (with a much smaller budget, BUT with Maggie Cheung) any time!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The paradoxical ideology of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is, like the final piece of advice which Michelle Yeoh gives to Jen, true to itself.  Its aesthetic principles are the same as its practice.  There is no desire without restraint, and repression only heightens passion we are told; this is lived out in the film, and experienced within the audience as it is brought to tears, in the final scene between the hitherto restrained lovers Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh.  After years of privation, self-control and stifled desire, these two finally embrace.  Preceded as it is by such restraint, it is a moment of ultimate cathartic release: passion breaking through dignified respect.  Yet it is also an expression of complete powerlessness: the love is thwarted and can never lead to anything.  The paradoxical nature of this (finding love only in death, finding release only in repression) proves the humanity and feeling of the film's Zen philosophy of order, of balancing opposites, upon the reader's pulses.The film looks at opposing forces: youth and venerability (or innocence and experience) classicism and romanticism', form and content', spirituality and materialism', sense and sensibility' (one of Ang Lee's previous films). In such a context, Jen represents the romantic materialism of youth (and the aristocracy) while Michelle Yeoh stands for the classical spirituality of experience (and working class stoical morality).  The latter preaches the philosophy of form and discipline to the former, but Jen will not accept the wisdom of the older woman's sensibility: she has been corrupted by a wicked master.  Jade Fox, the film's villain, has already taught her to dream of fame and freedom, independence and self-rule (romantic principles).  As a result she is suspicious of Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat's philosophy of restraint and submission: when he tells her, during a sparing fight, that the only way to find herself is to loose herself, she scorns him for talking like a monk.Jen is the hero of the film: she is the one that survives to enjoy the truly happy ending because she has been bold enough to love.  However, it is made very clear that her happiness has been bought at a price: her romantic adventurous fun perniciously brings Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat into martial confrontation, necessitating the subjugation of their love.  They harm none, but rather protect Jen from her own romanticism and this proves the superior strength and humanity of their classical restraint and formal discipline.  The benevolence which classical restraint is capable of administering is thus emphatically pointed out, especially in penultimate scene where, although her life has been ruined by Jen's impetuousness and the latter deserves to die for her folly, Michelle Yeoh stops the raised sword before it touches the girl's neck as a sign and a real implementation of the mercy of restraint (as opposed to the cruelty of passion).On the other hand, the film is not a straightforward advocation of the ascetic self-privation of monastic life: Chow Yun Fat's last words express his regret at having wasted his life in pursuit of spiritual excellence rather than love.  The materialism of Jen is part of her youth, her zest for life; while the spirituality of Chow Yun Fat is deathly and pale in comparison.  Jen chases the desert bandit in pursuit of her hair comb (green  the colour of life) and is equally obsessive about securing the green destiny sword.  She relishes the beauty of these two fertility symbols (the green comb and sword), risking her own death, after Chow Yun Fat has thrown it over the waterfall, to retrieve the sword.  Although her passionate romanticism makes her the film's hidden dragon , a secret poison that destroys, like her wicked master Jade Fox, it also makes her the film's nectar, its life force.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good even if not original.,"Many people are mislead that this movie is something original. It isn't. There are many previous movies that have ""flying men"" scenes in the fighting. Yuen Woo-Ping has been doing that kind of choreography since the 70's. It should also be noted that Chow Yun Fat cannot do martial arts and was a poor choice to play the role of a master just for that fact. Overall the movie is enjoyable and the scenery is good, but the story and fighting aren't original enough for true Hong Kong movie fans to consider it the best ever made. If you liked Crouching Tiger I recommend checking out some of the choreographers earlier works like Fist of Legend or Iron Monkey.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
beautiful and forgettable,"My thoughts on this film.It is a beautiful movie. It look s very very good. It has a lot of fighting scenes. Some of them are entertaining, but most of them are just plain stupid. The sound and music works fine, but are not that noteworthy.The main problems with this movie are these things:1.Uninspiring story2.You never really get to know the characters that good, so I at least couldnt care less about what happened to them. I dont think it is the actors or actresses fault, it is the story. Of course, if you speak Chinese you may get more into it, but I still think it will fall short.3.The flying. Why they thought that removing the gravity in some scenes would improve on the excitement I will never understand. It just ruins the whole thing.Some people has written here before that it is a fantasy movie and that we should have an open mind to what is possible in a fantasy movie. I agree, in a fantasy movie I always accept these things, but this is NOT a fantasy movie. At least none of the trailers or ad's for this movie has given me that impression. As far as I know it's a tale from the ancient times. If people flew back in those years I would love to know the reason. At least then I would accept it as a fairytale.This movie would be very good without the flying, and it could have been great with more depth. (Just because it comes from exotic China does not make it deep and thoughtful)Why people compare this to Matrix, I dont understand. They have absolutely nothing in common. (to say it is similar because of the fighting scenes is like comparing Rambo to the X-files because they both have guns in them)My personal impression of this movie says not to recommend it to others, but it is not a bad movie so a lot of people will like it.I will rate it as I rate games.Visuals: 9/10 Sound  : 8/10 Story  : 6/10 Value  : 6/10Score in the normal IMDB fashion would be a 7/10",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Four Oscars and still soaring over most thriller romances.,"""I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath that I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side as a condemned soul, than enter heaven without you. Because of your love, I will never be a lonely spirit."" Li Mu Bai (Chun Yow Fat)That is the stuff of Asian Romance: lyrical, loving, sacrificial. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a world apart from us: mysticism, leaping in single bounds, binding tradition, and pure love. Not just because it won the four Oscars including best picture is it one of cinema's great romances, but because with all the magic it presents, love is a real and sometimes agonizing romanticism. In other words, it has everything cinema can offer.And Michelle Yeoh, coming off her nomination for best actress in Everything Everywhere All at Once, is an anchor as Shu Lien a famed warrior, and also Chow Yun Fat as Mu Bai, a renowned swordsman and the co-sage with Shu. Although they have, in typical Asian secrecy, not professed their love to each other, everyone else knows they are in love.Like an Eastern Thin-Man couple, they help the search for an ancient sword and the defeat of Jade Fox (Cheng Pei Pei), an accomplished warrior who killed Mu Bai's mentor. Bad girl shouldn't have done that, nor should she have allegedly stolen the sword, Green Destiny.In a parallel Romeo and Juliet knockoff, Lien's new young friend Jen (Zhang Ziyi), not quite as innocent as she appears, does not want an arranged marriage but rather to love bandit Lo (Chang Chen). As the older romantic couple tries to help the younger, complications ensue too dense to explain here.One thing is for sure, they all can soar through the air, tumble like acrobats, and manage swords like Olympians. The movie, solidly helmed by auteur Ang Lee, is about grace, both in combat and in love, so that the outcomes have a delicate honesty often lost in rude Western depictions.To see warriors soar above giant bamboo forests and effortlessly glide on terra is part of the charm of this romantic story. Most of all, though, is its reverence for tradition and the modern at the same time. It's been 23 years since the charming Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon came on the scene-what took it so long!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
I WAS IMPRESSED,"This is the best film I have seen so far this year. I went in expecting kung fu action, but not the involving story which I enjoyed just as much as the amazing fight scenes.There is a romantic story set in the middle of this film between the two younger characters when they first meet, which I felt was a tad over-long. I thought the love-you feelings between the two 'wandering warriors' was much more believable. Not being a fan of romance, I found this very sweet never the less. For some movie-watchers, they will be very disappointed with this, because despite the chemistry between characters, you never see nudity or sex scenes (!)The kung fu battles were amongst the best I've ever seen! The 'flying martial arts fighters' gave the fights a new perspective! Reading the reviews, I'm surprised at the number of people who couldn't accept the abilities of the flying fighters. These would be the individuals who will happily accept Tom Cruise sliding alongside his speeding motorcycle on his non-smoking shoes while successfully shooting the bad guys and performing the sloppiest stunts (Mission Impossible 2).Those who go in expecting to see a Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan flick will be disappointed. This film is also sub titled.CONCLUSION? Beautiful scenery! I will probably watch this film again!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful,"I had heard so much praise about ""Crouching Tiger"" that I was afraid that I was expecting too much when I finally found a theater which was showing it.But I was not disappointed: The film is a masterpiece in its celebration of everything that's beautiful and it cherishes high ideals like honor, love and honesty. I really liked the story which was starting very slowly and suddenly exploded when the first flying around martial arts sequence came along - what a surprise to see these superhero-like fighters battle in the air, walking up the walls and hovering over the rooftops!From this moment on, the film never fails to get the viewers interest, be it in soft, well orchestrated emotional moments or in fierce, extremely quick fighting sequences.What really got me though was the grand finale: It was heart-wrenching and still so very calm and true, and having a secret love myself I really could feel the emotions of Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien. But while this was already wonderful, the very final scene was even more fantastic - a splendid climax to a splendid movie which made me sit there during the credits totally stunned just thinking: ""What a beautiful ending...""",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Proper Fantasy Film Making,"This is a marvellous film, a classic good vs. evil battle, with sweeping scenery, with epic battle, of fighting for what is right, and of individuals finding peace. And, yes, there are some spectacular fight sequences in the film, but to rate it solely on them is to miss the point. I dont think this is a Kung-Fu movie at all, its just a movie that has Kung-Fu in it. If all I wanted to see was fighting I wouldnt go to the cinema. I go to see a good story, well told, and this was certainly that. I was utterly absorbed.Making films like this which are intended to appeal to the mass market without the use of English is also a very welcome step, as is the lack of a conventional 'happy ending'. This film is not instant gratification, which most of the cinema going public now seem to demand, and I for one am glad of it.I honestly cant think how Ang Lee, possibly the best director working today, could make this film it any better. To the detractors in here critisising the film on the basis that people cant fly, well, no. I cant fly. Nor can you. But this is a FANTASY. That means that the content need not reflect reality all that closely. I think it unlikely that a small ring owned by a hobbit can control all the evil in the universe, but it didnt stop me enjoying a film about that.The high rating in the top 250 is richly deserved, 10/10 every time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Slouching Tiger, Snoozing Viewer","I like to think that I am generally one of the most open minded viewers around, but, had ""The Fast and the Furious"" not been released in 2001, I would have had no hesitation whatsoever in pronouncing CTHD the most dreary, uninteresting film of the past decade. Okay, yes I confess, I am not a lover of martial arts movies, but given the global recognition and awards picked up by the film, I was expecting the cinematic masterpiece it was cracked up to be. The movie was too slow (and I normally LIKE slow films!), the story was like ""Dallas"" but with swords and sarongs instead of oil, and has sent me to sleep each and every time I have attempted to watch it.

Magnificent.,"Finally, a Chinese language movie that mainstream America is going to watch and enjoy and forget they are reading sub-titles.There is a great deal here:  wondrous photography, a quiet but compelling soundtrack, special effects that are untouchable, a great story and script and gripping acting.This is one of those all-too-rare films that has both magical special effects and a great story; many movies of late sacrifice the story for the special effects  but the effects here add to the complexity of the story and enhance it.And the story is complex  There is a lot going on here; from unrequited love and passion, a mysterious and powerful sword, all-out action to quiet contemplation and peace.The martial arts scenes are over-the-top  transitioning quickly into quiet, serene moments of peace  the colossal change in mood, tempo and pacing is very effective.Chow Yun-Fat is at his serene best as Master Li Mu Bai and is perfectly complimented by Michelle Yeoh's Shu Lien.  Ziyi Zhang as Jen Yu is superb as the young girl with enormous talent for the martial arts and Cheng Pei-pei as Jade Fox is her master that has been eclipsed by the student.The sound track is one of the most compelling I have heard in a long, long time  It is subtle and enhances the scenes instead of detracting from them. It is powerful yet quiet  much as the character Li Mu Bai is.The photography was beyond superb.  I just never knew what I was going to see next  from magnificent over-shots of the city of Peking, to the stark and barren desert wasteland that Lo (Chang Chen) inhabits to the verdant forest in which the best martial arts scene takes place.  This is a China that few people will ever see and it is worth going to the film just for the photography.I am so glad this film was not dubbed into English  hopefully it never will be.  To see the characters moving their mouths in the beautiful Mandarin language and hearing something else would be a crime.As I said above  there is a great deal here  too much to describe  it is a film that must be seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Simply amazing,"I won't write a long-winded review because frankly if you haven't seen this film by now, you are not living a full life.Easily the most beautiful film (next to The Black Stallion and the LOTR series) ever made. I've seen Lawrence of Arabia and this film brings to mind the definition of the word EPIC. Beautiful, breathtaking and superb, it should be a permanent addition to your library.If you are looking for one of the most fabulously crafted love story combined with amazing martial arts and Oscar worth scenery, this is the film for you. I work in the film industry and I see a lot of movies. I always return to CTHD time and time again for a spirited take on a classic story of unrequited love. The subtle nature of the acting is different from what we in the ""West"" are used to, but it fits. I highly recommend watching it in the original language (I believe it's Hunan, not Mandarin but I'm not sure) with English subtitles as opposed to a version that's dubbed in English. The sound quality is poor on the dubbed film and overruns the fabulous score.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this movie and finally got round to catching it on DVD. Firstly, I admit that I watched the dubbed version which, although approved by Ang Lee, was stunted and did the film a disservice. The voice acting was wooden - simple as that. Hey - it was late and I didn't fancy keeping an eye on subtitles!The plotline was interesting but nothing special - the story of a stolen sword intertwining with that of a young woman who must decide which path she wants to take in her life. It's quite long winded but worth sticking with despite it ham-fistedness because the loose ends are tied up quite beautifully.The only great thing about this film is the visuals that are simply stunning. The fight scenes are over rated and what really stands out is the gentle cinematography that frames the story in a mythical almost childlike fashion. It's basically a fairytale - just imagine you were to write down the story on paper and read it to your children (once upon a time there was a mighty sword....)I was left fairly cold by this film, despite the beautifully poetic ending. I disagree with what some others have written in that I don't think this is a better film than Gladiator. Visually it could be argued that it is superior, but in all other ways it is inferior.It is a good film in it's own right and is well worth your time, although whether you'll return for repeated viewings is another matter.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I guess I was thinking of a different kind of genre, perhaps a western style action flick, empty but entertaining, where the participants use martial arts instead of guns & bombs.  If this film is the best martial arts film ever, then I was mistaken.  Yes, the martial arts are impressive, but that's all it is.  It's like a ballet or a choreographed dance w/fists & feet.

Slightly above average martial arts film,"The one thing this movie has over the average martial arts film is the cinematography. There is a lot of beautiful scenery and they show it. Other than that, it's pretty typical stuff for the genre - revenge motive, lots of fights, and unfortunately lots of flying. The flying is neat the first time you see it; It's really old by the twenty-fifth time. It's a gimmick like the camera gimmick in the Matrix. The plot is very average. I have to wonder if the people fawning over this thing have ever seen a martial arts movie before. They're all like this. Martial arts movies were quite popular in the US back in the 1980s, so it's no big deal that there's still one being shown here. Sure, most of the American ones were absolute crap, but if you really delve deeply into the genre, and don't mind reading subtitles, there's some truly spectacular stuff out there. Stuff that makes this movie seem like an unimaginative run through the clichés in comparison.Martial arts films are full of strong female characters, many of the movies have absolutely startling cinematography, there's always an ending that fans of Hollywood blockbusters wouldn't expect, the characters are most often consumed with internal conflict, etc.As far as the fighting in this movie, it's not bad. Nothing compared to a Bruce Lee film - nothing at all - but at least it's not silly like so much of the Jackie Chan slapstick stuff these days.Overall, if you think this movie is great, boy, are you ever lucky, because you've just discovered a genre in which movies like this one are only slightly above average. Some of the really good ones will blow your mind.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderful fantasy movie - Best film of 2000...,"Y2K is perhaps the worst year for movies. There are so many disappointments that I almost gave up watching new release movies and rent older classic movies on DVD and videotape (e.g., Seven Samurai). Pessimistic about going to the theatre to see the movie because it's 'overhyped' and has so much word-of-mouth praise, I came in with low expectation - surprise, surprise...""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" alone restored my faith in movies.This movie blew my mind. Astounding visual martial arts choreography and wirework stunts from Yuen Wo Ping, who also contributed to ""The Matrix"". Flawless structures. Gorgeous cinematography. Excellent pacing and character development. And most importantly, the movie has the mix of fantasy, romance, comedy and drama elements to tell a good story that held my attention for two hours without ever looking at my watch (which I never did).Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Ziyi Zhang and Chen Chang did the fantastic job of bringing their unique acting skills to excellence in the film, and that should make Hollywood hang its head in shame. Ang Lee has finally crafted the film that do not drag and meander, unlike his previous efforts. Rather he lets the pacing take its place on unfolding the motive and development of lead and supporting characters - even seamlessly transporting to the past involving the relationship of Jen (Ziyi Zhang) and Lo (Chen Chang) which do not halt the film to a grind; instead this give the characters more screentime in background so that we could empathize with them. Divulging the plot is absolutely unnecessary, since the story is as complex as Hayao Miyazaki's animated epic ""Mononoke Hime (Princess Mononoke)"". It's better to see the movie without knowing what it's about, which should guarantee a fresh and unforgettable movie-going experience.Kudos to all involved in the making of this now-classic masterpiece, including Lee's longtime screenwriting partner James Schamus who contributed the additional dialogues to the script by Hui-Ling Wang and Kuo Jung Tsai based on the Chinese novel by Du Lu Wang. Yuen Wo Ping should receive the prestigious honorary award for his contribution of stunts to films over the last 30 years.

"Ang Lee defies the standards, rules, and gravity for that matter in his first Chinese film since 1994's ""Eat Drink Man Woman"" in this exhiliarating and breathtaking tale that will surely become a c","The story takes place during the Ching Dynasty in the 19th century. Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) is considered one of the greatest martial art warriors of all time in China. Li asks his girlfriend, Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), to give his sword, The Green Destiny, to a friend of his father's. Li Mu Bai is determined to give up his fighting days and settle down with Shu Lien. Once Sir Te stores the sword away, it disappears and a greater mystery is unveiled, involving a long-time foe named Jade Fox, the beautiful daughter of the Governor named Jen (Zhang Zi-Yi), and her past lover from the desert. Age and culture hold no barriers to the film's purpose. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is an adaptation of the fourth book (out of five) from a popular Chinese literature series by author Wang Dulu. Despite it's revered presence amongst the young crowd in China, film watchers around the world will be able to identify with this film, making the story an international epic. Although the events take place several generations ago, the story is one that all of humanity can identify with, for the film addresses issues that are innate to everyone: loyalty, revenge, love, and honor.Director Ang Lee accomplishes a tremendous amount of merit in this picture. The backdrop setting for the movie is nothing but breathless. Ang Lee brings this classic story to life by choosing locations that are, in essence, picture perfect. Also contributing to the ambience of the movie experience is a beautiful, and well-written score by Yo-Yo Ma, which mimics every emotion of each character through each somber note. While English-speaking audiences might feel the frustration of reading the subtitles and watching the action at the same time, the acting by the performers is almost enough to figure out the storyline without the use of translation. Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh deliver their best performances in this picture, with little doubt as to whether or not they will receive accolades for their work. Also coming forward as a future rising star in Asia is Zhang Zi-Yi (who plays Jen). Only 19 years old, Zi-Yi did not have any knowledge of martial arts at the beginning of the shooting, and was trained completely on the spot. Rrrrright.....action and acting combined? Believe it or not, Ang Lee succeeds in doing this. Rather than random shoot'em ups, bloody fistfights, and kung fu that simply looks cool, the action is as pertinent to the movie as the dialogue. The fighting scenes are obviously enhanced through the use of special effects, yet they are every bit breathtaking as a lightsaber dual. With all of this combined into ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", the movie should not be compared to that of ""The Matrix"" or any other kung fu movies. Rather, it stands on its own as a distinct and true masterpiece that serves as epic storytelling that can still exist in a cynical modern society.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I love its dynamism and flair for the slightly insane. CTHD takes all the things I like about the genre and gives it a hollywood rub down. The production values and cinematography are breath taking. The story actually is enjoyable and the dialogue never really seems stunted. Although some would argue that these are exactly the reasons it is inferior to original HK cinema.The oft-discussed fight scenes are never less than spectacular, with Michele Yeoh really shining alongside Zhang Zi Yi. Although it does make your mouth water to imagine what the film would have been like if Woo Ping had Jet Li to work with as opposed to Chow Yun-Fat. Although I think Li would seem a bit young as opposed to Yun-Fat's almost regal portrayal of a battle weary master.My only real problem with the film is the loooong flashback sequence. It is the only part of the film which even approaches being dull. While I appreciate it sets up a lot of the story and fleshes out Jens character, It is a bit drawn out.I would recommend CTHD to almost anyone. It has heart, action and is aurally and visually stunning. I hope there are further releases based on the mythology of this film.

A Fantastic Resume Entry,"Having just seen TIGER-DRAGON, I am sifting out the bits and pieces in my mind, particularly between the involvement of the film's writers with that of the director -- and where the creativity of this film is placed.  This is my first martial-arts type film, so I am no qualified critic in that genre other than saying it definitely has many excellently crafted surreal poetic moments in the ability to fly and escape.  Which is the theme or moral of the film:  take an 8am-to-5pm job or go over the hill on a whim or return from that hill to settle down and take a wife or lover.These comments are my very Western appreciation of this film - which is Ang Lee's forte from what I observe from past films (with my top vote going to THE ICE STORM which I think set the stage for AMERICAN BEAUTY's recent awards).There is nothing negative about this film.  It is NOT the best film this year, nor during the prior decade. It may be the BEST MARTIAL ARTS FILM.I think ANG LEE has provided these talents:1) Re-introducing English speaking/reading folks to FOREIGN LANGUAGE films and to use one's mind when viewing a film; 2) Blending Western familiarities (i.e. a Dodge City-type saloon brawls) with more subtle Eastern values of mystique and patience and honor. 3) Great editing and continuity along a fast-paced path (i.e. do not drink a DietCoke any time before your viewing if you anticipate a short visit to the restroom). 4) A fantastic initiation to Wu Xia swords and wizardry, if that is what was happening or tagged (I will start reading my second Harry Potter book tonight!!)Those are my thoughts.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One imdb user, stevesawyer or sommat doesn't seem to realise that this film is a fantasy film and the use of the 'flying people' isn't because people can ACTUALLY do that, because as we all know we can't, it's just part of the fairytale.

Just say NO to wire work,"Damn you, critics. You all hyped this movie up as the ultimate end-all, be-all of Martial Arts adventure films. Well, as someone who has been watching Hong Kong action cinema and Samurai films for years, I must honestly report that this film, while enjoyable and excellent in many respects, does not quite live up to the hype.But let's discuss the good, first. Casting is excellent. I've loved Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat for years, and it was a genuine pleasure to see them together in this film. Both of them excel in both acting and martial arts abilities here. Also excellent is the beautiful young actress Ziyi Zhang as Jen Yu, and Chen Chang, as the bandit ""Lo"", brings a much-appreciated dose of humor and charm to contrast the more severe and reserved characters played by Chow Yun and Michelle. Their intermingled stories of unrequited love are funny and heartbreaking and provide some enjoyable ""down time"" between combat sequences.The Action scenes are also, for the most part, lighting-paced and exciting. I especially enjoyed the sword styles used in the film. The sword battle between Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang is amazing, and Chow Yun Fat seems to effortlessly make ""Green Destiny"" dance like a living thing.However, the one thing that completely detracted from the film's magic was the overblown use of wire work. Characters seem to fly more than they walk in this film, and the whole thing takes on a ridiculous ""Peter Pan"" quality after a while. I know everyone thinks that wire work is new, a trend started by ""The Matrix"". The fact is that it's been used (and overused) in many Martial Arts films for years. I've never been a huge fan of it. However, I enjoyed the wire work in ""The Matrix"" because it was used relatively sparingly and punctuated the action perfectly. It was also much more believable once we understood that the world of ""The Matrix"" was a computer-created illusion, unfettered by real physics. However, I fear that the popularity of ""The Matrix"" has created a disturbing new trend of using wire work as a crutch to boost the action sequences, as seen in ""Romeo Must Die"", the horrific ""Charlie's Angels"", and now here. But the thing that bothered me the most about the wire work in this film is that it LOOKED like wire work. It was much more clean-looking and effective when used in short bursts in the ""The Matrix"". Here, however, characters float from roof to roof as if Peking were one big trampoline, and it is blatantly obvious in their movements that they are suspended from something (although the wires themselves have all been digitally erased, of course). While it didn't completely ruin the film for me, it did keep me from taking it very seriously a lot of the time, and that is too bad because this epic story was meant to be taken seriously. In my (not so) humble opnion, however, the best martial arts films are those that can display amazing physical feats while still observing the basic laws of physics. Perhaps that is why some of the old Japanese Samurai films (for example, the ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" series) are so incredible, because the strength of the action sequences flowed from the actor's skill and lightning-speed with his blade, rather than his character's supposed ability to jump into the air and run across his enemies' heads like stepping stones.So, bottom line, this is a film worth seeing, and there is much here to enjoy. Just don't feel guilty about laughing at the excessive wire work, and don't go into the theater expecting it to be the Second Coming of Bruce Lee.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Give me a break!,"Yes the cinematography and special effects were excellent, but forgive me for probably being politically incorrect, but I like American movies, period.

The pure poetry of the scenery is magic and could well have survived as a movie on its own, without any help from a story!That said, the story is also quite extraordinary.  The 'magical' jade sword is stolen from it's rightful owner and a search for the thief ensues. Include a sub-plot of vengeance between the Jade Fox and the young man whose master was killed by Jade Fox and you have a story.  This is an incredibly simplistic synopsis.I think the beauty of this whole film is its simplicity.  The relationships are uncomplicated, the reasons for revenge are simple.

Great Film,"The complaints I've read about this film here are not valid: too long, subtitles, unrealistic special effects. First, the length. I'm guessing this criticism is mostly because people got ""tired"" having to ""read"" through the movie. THese are the same people that ruin foriegn films by convincing studios to dub them with English. If you don't like subtitles, wait for the DVD, don't see the film or learn the language. Of these only learning the language is the truest way to experience the intent of the script. Second, subtitles...see above. Third is the special effects. I've got some advice for people that ""laugh"" at the flying scenes: stay at home. People seeing this move should just accept the idea that people can fly if trained right. If people can't get over this part of the story, they should just walk out rather than laugh out loud because they don't understand. On the film: it's a great story, great direction, great acting. The desert scene seemed a little long but it was necessary to the story and very enjoyable to watch. As far as the last star wars piece of junk being better than this: uh, whatever. If Michelle Yo doesn't win an oscar for her perfmance it will be the biggest mistake for the Academy, second only to the Titanic sweep a few years back.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Film Review: Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","Martial arts films are often enjoyable but they are seldom great art. Now, to everyone's surprise, Ang Lee, director of a number of excellent films, has made a martial arts film called Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. The result is a masterpiece.
The film belongs to a type of Chinese story called wuxia. These stories tell of nineteenth-century martial arts masters with unusual abilities. Wuxia films are popular in China, and they are now popular in the west too.
The story takes place in the early 1800s in China. A man and a woman, Li Mubai (played by Chow Yun-Fat) and Yu Xiulian (played by Michelle Yeoh), both masters of the martial arts, are in love with each other. But Xiulian had a fiancé who has died. Because this fiancé was a good friend of Mubai, Mubai feels that he cannot marry Xiulian. When someone steals Xiulian's sword, Mubai and Xiulian try to get it back. The action takes place on Peking rooftops, and in places as far away as the deserts of western China. As in the old wuxia stories, characters leap through the air every now and then, with beautiful, graceful movements, while audiences shout in surprise.
Unusually, it is the female characters that interest us most. Brave, good and strong, Xiulian is the character we care about most. Beautiful Zhang Ziyi plays the part of Yu Jiaolong, a young woman who is not as good as she seems. The fight scenes between Jiaolong and Xiulian are some of the most exciting moments in modern cinema. But one cannot forget the wonderful Chow Yun-Fat, who is as good with a sword as he is with a gun. His romantic scenes with Yu Xiulian are very moving, as their eyes show all the love that they must not express in words.
Films like this rarely reach the cinema. Go and see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It will make your heart leap with excitement at its beauty.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a beautiful film.,"This film is absolutely one of the most beautiful I've seen in quite a long time.  The characters are well-crafted, the plot will mean many different things to many people, the cinematography is top-notch, and the choreography is often breathtaking.

Hours afterward, now, I am deeply satisfied, and my mind has been working through the film's layers, discovering new meanings with each successive consideration.  When I stop considering the various other aspects of this film I'll simply remember the scenery.I predict anyone who sees this film will enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bloody Masterpiece!,"No doubt, Crouching Tiger is a milestone in film making. A watershed event. Sheer poetry in motion. At certain points in the movie, words simply failed me. The plot works on several levels. At a very superficial glance, it may be a simple folklore Kung Fu in the backdrop of love. Go deeper & you're in for a treat. The reactions it evoked in the audience & myself left me stunned. Some were open-mouthed, shell-struck. Some like me, wept openly! It was just too much for some - there were dazed, reflective viewers all around, figuring out what hit them!! Then there were the fringe group who simply didn't get it - they thought it was a female Jackie Chan action flick :( Crouching Tiger has already been nominated for the Oscars, & will hopefully pick up its fair share. In my opinion, this flick deserves every single award it can lay claim to. Its simply an awesome visual treat!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good but not great martial arts film; overrated,"Now I've been watching martial arts films for my entire life. I've been watching Asian martial arts films for years, so I've seen it all. I've seen the old style choreography, the modern kickboxing, the Jackie Chan style of prop fighting, the new wave wire fu of the 1990s, etc. I'm not one of those people that'll go into the film and criticize it because it's unbelievable. After all, I watch films to escape from reality, not to let it get bogged down.The plot deals with the events that occur following the theft of a legendary sword. These events affect the lives of a swordsman (Chow), a governor's daughter (Ziyi), a master criminal (Peipei), and the leader of an escort service (Yeoh). It's not really important to discuss those in detail.A lot of the film's praise goes back to the fight scenes. Well, they're good. Yuen Woo Ping is one of the masters of choreography. The swordfight is especially good, probably my favorite cinematic sword fight. But on the whole, it's nothing new. Chow holds his own, but isn't spectacular. Zhang Ziyi looks decent but people like Donnie Yen could do the same things without wires. Michelle is excellent as usual, I think she was underused in the fights, she only gets two scenes (which are the highlights of the film). However, like I said, it's nothing new or ground breaking. And for people that criticize the flying people, IT'S A FANTASY!The other praised aspects of the film is where the line between those who know the genre and those who don't gets defined. This is not the first martial arts film to have a good musical score. Just watch the Swordsman series or the Once Upon A Time in China series. Those movies have awesome scores and far more memorable songs. This is not the first martial arts movie to have a good storyline. Once again, check out the Swordsman movies or the Once Upon a Time in China films (well the first 3) and there you get good stories. Jet Li's Tai Chi Master and Fist of Legend also have good storylines. There are dozens of martial arts films out there that have good storylines. This is also not the first martial arts film to have good cinematography, acting, or characters. People treat it as if it were the first. Sorry people, that's not the case.It's really an insult to Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Donnie Yen, Jet Li, Yuen Biao, and a lot of the other classic Hong Kong action starts when people praise this movie so much. Why? Because they've been doing this stuff for years (often times without wires and computer enhancement) and yet they've not gotten the same wide respect from American audiences. Also, it's insulting to them that a film with few actual martial artists (Michelle Yeoh is the main exception) gets so much praise, when the people that really know the stuff can't get the same.I'm not saying this to say that this isn't a good film. I'm saying that it's overrated and nothing new. People who say this is the greatest martial arts film ever really need to go back and watch a lot of the classics of the genre to understand what I mean.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Beautiful to look at but oddly lacks punch,"I agree with Richard Finch here. Here is a visually beautiful film that obviously required talent to bring to the screen. Much money went into the lavish and beautiful sets, even that of a cave dweller who probably has more beautiful things than most people do in urban America. The cinema photographer also did a wonderful job filming a China a lot of Chinese people probably don't ever get to see.So, what is wrong with the film? Unfortunately, the characters really aren't all that deep. It's a pretty formulaic story and a familiar one as well. Unrequited love that isn't actually spoken of much until it's too late.The fight sequences, though beautiful are so far fetched they are distracting and pull us out of the story. I kept thinking of Kill Bill and how it just packs a punch, hits you right in the gut and it just all works. We also can really relate to the characters in Kill Bill and they've got grit!Here, a lot just seems sort of tepid.

The composition of the pictures is so brilliant that the whole movie seems like a dream; the dream of another fascinating world. And Lee does an important thing more: He integrates the spectator in this world, shows him a huge storm of pictures which is perfect filmed by Peter Pau. For me, these fantastic pictures were the highlight of the movie. If I wanted to remember another movie, which has such a supreme cinematography I would have to search very long - this was really great!Even so I think, that most people were fascinated by the absolutely staggering choreography of the fighting scenes.

Why is this movie liked so much?,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  Maybe one of the most eye-pleasing movies that I have seen in a long time.  It was flat out a beautiful movie. However, despite the breathtaking panoramas of the Asian landscapes, I did not enjoy this movie all that much. I have seen both the English dubbed version of the movie and the original Mandarin, and in both I found myself guessing at why the characters were doing what they were doing.  I have talked with many people, even those who liked it, and they themselves admitted that they had trouble following the plot.  From what I could gather of the plot, it seemed to unfold much like a comic book, with a love intrigue, old and new, and the hero avenging something or other.  Over all, I did not enjoy the movie.  So, this brings me back to my first question: Why was this movie liked so much?This is my take on that question. It seems as though the American public is tired of your classic, cute, Hollywood film.  OR they want to appear that way.  Yes, if you have seen a film that has come from overseas, and been dubbed in a different language, people will give you some intellectual respect for that.  And if you enjoyed it, well, then, aren't you a little appreciator-of-the-arts!If you haven't seen this movie already, I wouldn't recommend that you don't see it.  Some of the fight scenes are cool, and it is a change of pace. If you end up liking it in the end, good for you. Just don't go into the moving expecting to like it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful parable,"Some movies should be viewed like a painting at a museum: You sit and slowly absorb the mastery of detail, and the interpretive expression the artist labored long hours to convey. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is such a picture. (Kubrick's ""Barry Lyndon"" was another.)The main flaw in this masterpiece, and perhaps the reason it has garnered so many negative reviews in this forum, is that its opening scenes provide very little guidance to Western audiences for what follows. We are therefore unprepared for sudden breaks from ""reality"" as characters begin to fly in the middle of fight scenes, and we don't understand the rules of this ancient, mythical Chinese civilization. Also, there is a certain ""language"" that develops around certain film genres, and without having viewed previous movies of this type, it may be difficult to grasp the significance of many scenes. Imagine, for instance, someone from China viewing ""High Noon"" without ever having watched another American Western. The heroic depth of Gary Cooper's refusal to leave town can only be fully appreciated by having viewed countless similar films, and knowing that the ""code of the West"" requires certain things of its heroes. Lacking this context, it was difficult at times to truly appreciate the characters. (However, viewing the DVD supplementary material helps enormously).Despite these handicaps, this is one of the most stunningly gorgeous films ever created, with a simple, but compelling, parable at its center that can be appreciated by any viewer regardless of what movies he or she may have seen before.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Pretension thy name is Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","Yet another feverishly overpraised film that critics needed to invent superlatives to describe.  While admittedly I am not a fan of martial art films as a rule, I have enjoyed a handful of them and thought this may fall within similar parameters.  Alas the film is a debacle on nearly all fronts. After a promising start, which introduces a wise warrior (Chow Yun-Fat), a female bodyguard who pines for him (Michelle Yeoh) and a coy young woman (Zhang Ziyi) staying as a guest in the home where everyone initially intersects, the film bogs down into lumbering tedium.  Much emphasis is initially placed on a sword, which during the course of the film gets stolen, returned, stolen again, but it really has little to do with the fragile plot.  In fact, so thinly conceived is the storyline and dialogue that one becomes frightened that a slight breeze may shred it to pieces. Characters are introduced as if they will be important and then are seemingly forgotten in the following scenes.  Headliners Yun-Fat and Yeoh (who actually manages a touching performance) seem to embody potentially interesting characters, but are shoved into the background and forced to play second fiddle to Ziyi, whose character is quickly uncovered to be a spoiled brat with a penchant for violence and destruction.  Definitely not the kind of character to enlist sympathy and carry the film.  Yun-Fat spends the majority of his minimal screen time trying to convert Ziyi from the Dark Side so that she can become the first woman to receive official training in the arts.  There are lots of gravity-defying fight sequences that would be borderline ridiculous if the film did not treat everything with such grave solemnity.  Instead, they just become boring.  Ironically, the fight sequences do not even make sense within the context of the film  (i.e., while the film explains the aerial acrobatics as being an effect of the mysterious ""training"" and is careful to explain how Ziyi and her mentor have achieved it, how then can Yeoh also manage the same aerial feats when the film tells us she has never had said training?).  The desert romance sequence seems to come from another film and the set-up with Ziyi and her ""kidnapper"" beating each other, then resting, then beating each other, etc., all over a comb, grows wearisome quick.  A friend that I saw this with waxed wistful over the drapes, tablecloths and costumes, which pretty much indicates how engrossing this will be to the average viewer.  The running time seems easily double what it is and should you be awake for the jaw-dropping ""symbolic"" climax, you will know first-hand pretension to the nth degree.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The pinnacle of what a Chinese fantasy movie should be,"I lived in Hong Kong for nearly three years of my life and I learned Cantonese.  I've been married to my wife from Taiwan for over four years now, and I've picked up Mandarin.  I love Chinese culture, Chinese people, and Asian history tremendously -- however, I've never been a fan of kung fu movies.  Why?  Because most of them do great injustice in their presentation of the art of Kung Fu -- they over-stylize it, they become pop pieces of phony action sound effects, vomit-inducing camera movements, and shotgun editing.  And the stories -- sweet Buddha -- such tremendous wealth of incredible Chinese literature available, all but unknown to the West -- trivialized by bad acting, bad writing, quick-buck-turning productions. Some of Jet Li's Wong Fei Hong films are considerably good, and the kung fu can't be beat, but the stories are still slaughtered -- the characters (especially the female characters) are excruciatingly stereotypical.After viewing Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I came close to weeping for joy.  This is what Chinese fantasy films should aspire to. This is the film that Chinese literature has been dying for -- a very true-to-source adaptation of an excellent Chinese novel, incredibly acted and reconstructed.  The mood is subdued throughout, not wontonly hyper. The fight scenes are, for the most part, scrolling and steady, showing stealth and true physically acute movements -- not a rampant collage of quick cuts, zoom ins, and the same two swooshing and contact sound effects over and over.I could go on with Ang Lee's genius, but I'll just recommend the films ""Pushing Hands"" and ""The Wedding Banquet"" as his other less-known masterpieces.The story is an excellent example of traditional Chinese fiction, full of personal dilemma, altruistic heroes with deeply embedded values (Where has altruism gone in American heroes?), and more non-verbal than spoken communication between characters.  The concept of great personal loss is hardly something you see in American literature and film -- suffering can never be near as great as the forced good-feeling ending.  Loss is an eternal theme in Chinese fiction -- one must lose to gain deeper love and appreciation.Some people have criticized the dialog -- well, no matter how well a language is translated in the subtitles, there are always inflections, hidden meanings, cultural references, and idioms that subtitles cannot communicate fully -- some that cannot be translated at all without deeper explanations.  (Imagine a Chinese person trying to watch ""Wayne's World"" or ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" in Chinese subtitles -- how the hell do you translate THAT?)  Plus, subtitles have to trim expressions down to the basest level to have enough screen-time to be read.  Unless you are fluent in Chinese, do not criticize this movie for its dialog -- which the subtitles do a fair job of translating.See this movie -- on the big screen if you can.  For those unfamiliar with Asian fiction, it's an extremely moving introduction to true Kung Fu ethics of ancient times and traditional story-telling style of the best of Chinese fantasy.  Keep one thing in mind, though -- most of the gravity-defying physical feats portrayed ARE meant to be fantasy -- they're representations of mythical feats of great Kung Fu secrets and mastery, enabling one to be superhuman.  If you're an action movie fan, and you don't scoff the good-guy's ever-loaded, perfect-aiming pistol in your favorite action movie, don't ""sheesh"" or ""yeah, right"" any of the beautiful gravity-defying movements in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I hope my tears don't damage my keyboarzk^lA@d,"It's been an hour since I saw Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and my throat is still burning and my eyes leaking as I write this.  I was startled to find myself crying tears of amazement and joy half way through the first astonishing heart pounding action sequence, then later was racked with helpless sobbing as the story moved inexorably towards its conclusion, and be warned, it's not a Hollywood ending.  It's been ten years since a film has affected me this deeply, and it wasn't a Hollywood effort then either; it was Depardieu's Cyrano de Bergerac.In fact, Crouching Tiger shares some elements with Cyrano, not to mention Beowulf and Homer.  It's a simple, classic story, and (note to Hollywood) it's the simplicity of this picture that makes it so exquisitely poignant. No interminatable orchestral crescendos, no shouting in lieu of acting, no ""Aargh!  Ya got me!"" pauses and grimaces during the action sequences. Instead, we have a single but insistent drum or a haunting chello, reserved, measured emotion that builds genuine interest in the characters, and important elements in the action sequences that are gone so fast that you'll miss them if you so much as blink.  You have to actually *watch* Crouching Tiger, it's not shoved down your throat.  Don't eat, don't drink, don't even *breathe* or you'll miss something.What strikes me most is the the contrast with the Hollywood trailers that preceeded it. ""ACADEMY AWARD WINNER JOE BLOW!... ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEE NANCY McBLAND!... IN A FILM THAT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER!... YOU WILL BE MOVED!... YOU WILL BE THRILLED!..."" blared Voiceover Man desperately, as Hollywood's finest screamed at each other, pounded their chests and sweated testosterone, and I wondered why I should care.  But then they all went away, and for for two hours I was reminded that movies can actually work magic.The only downside was that I had to watch it with other people.  Granted, the theatre was nearly empty, but there was still one idiot that I heard give a panicked whisper of ""Is it all in Japanese?"" to his girlfriend about two minutes in.  Yes, it's all in ""Japanese"" (Cantonese and Mandarin), and if that scares you, stay well away.  Likewise, if you don't like crying at films, don't bother going; you'll spend the last ten minutes gritting your teeth and hissing ""Real. Men. Don't. Cry."" and feeling lots of those pesky emotion things.However, go in with an open mind, and you will be astonished and moved. You will gasp and you will sob - and you will wonder why on earth Hollywood can't make films like this.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Missing something?,"I finally saw Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and although the two hours was very enjoyable and the film never dragged, I am still unclear how it became an Oscar contender.

Without a doubt the best movie of the year,"My girlfriends co-workers told her this movie had a lot to do with women and that they were basically the main characters in the film. They also said some men might not enjoy the movie for that reason. They were half right.While the females may have received a greater amount of screen time, I didn't feel at all that the movie was ""based"" on women. I thought all the characters received adequate screen time in order to develop their characters. At one point the film takes close to a 30 minute departure from the main plot to explore the relationship between the governor's daughter and the leader of a group of thieves.That said- each and every single character in the movie was fantastic. Not only in the actor's portrayal of them, but their significance in the film. I really found myself experiencing an emotion over each of them.The fight scenes were beautifully choreographed and showed such ridiculous imagination it was almost frightening. The very first battle scene alone made me quickly draw comparisons to the greatness of the Matrix, but quickly surpassed it as the movie drove on. I can't fully expressed how astonished I was left at the end of each and every single combat sequence in this film. I am taken back when I think of how the actors had to truly have knowledge in using the weapons they employed. Incredible respect goes to them.The subtitles? Not a problem. I even thought after a while that I was beginning to understand the foreign tongue.Scenery in this film was absolutely breathtaking. There's no need to elaborate on this- take my word on it.Gladiator was another one of my picks for best movie of the year because of its sheer grandness, but ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" was enormously more anchored in its premise and creativity. This movie is outstanding.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

action is OK but why the flying people?,"like I said, the fighting scenes are pretty good but not backed up well enough by a good story to make them really enjoyable.

Just fit it in where ever you like.""Also from my summary you can tell that I hated the way everyone flies.

Indeed, it is a martial arts masterpiece, but it also has romance, adventure and everything else one would expect in a true epic.The luscious tapestry of this film seems to go on forever with one breathtaking vista after another. The interior sets are superb.The story and language of the film is poetic and full of metaphor and mysticism. At the same time it keeps marching forward to an infectious drumbeat, and the action is stupendous.Like most epics, only the big screen can do this film justice.

Romantic Renaissance for the Martial Arts Genre,"For those expecting a chopsocky Jackie Chan flick( I bet there will be many), you will be sorely disappointed. But for the rest of you, enjoy the visual treat that is 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'.This genre defying film is lensed with a vivid appreciation, not only for China's immense panoramic beauty but for its romantic folklores and sumptously rich culture.Under the masterful hands of director Ang Lee, 'Crouching' has been elevated from an expertly choreographed Martial Arts flick, into a nuanced character-driven tale. A tale fleshed out by tour-de-force performance from its strong cast(including Chow Yun Fatt, Michelle Yeoh and new comer Zhang Ziyi etc) and laced with such piercing poetic lyricism, it brings out the true essence of those bygone era Swordsman classics. One can only marvel at Lee's perceptual understanding and passion for this personal labour of love.All things said and done, 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' marks a renaissance for the Kung-fu movie genre. Oscar or no Oscar, this film will be catapulted into the realms of motion picture classics in years to come.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Brilliantly acted, peacefully emotional and high on action this Wuxia film is quite different from regulars.",Based on the book by Wang Du Lu this movie is a true definition of Wuxia films. Ang Lee's master direction can be felt here. This movie presents the complexities of human emotions well. Brilliantly acted and high on action it is quite different from other run of the mill Kung Fu flicks. The movie begins very peacefully and calmly and then a horde of flying fights scenes starts and the fun begins. When this movie was released they we have a black and white TV and we watched it in black and white and CDs. Those were the days. It was Ang Lee masterful direction and a good adaption of Wang Du Lu's Wuxia novel that we enjoyed every bit of the movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Very worthwhile, but not truly great","I went to see ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" knowing little about the film other than that it had received consistently glowing reviews. That being said, I suspect my expectations may have been cast a bit too high.What makes this film wonderful -- though some aficionados may consider it a drawbrack -- is its versatility. Ang Lee brings experienced cinematography, understanding of dramatic construction and solid film-making to the martial arts genre, with mostly splendid results.There are times, however, where this blend showed signs of weakness; suspension of disbelief was sorely challenged by several flying sequences not supported well either by the storyline nor by the rather paltry special-effects budget. Additionally, the silliness of a few sequences (including the bar scene paying homage to old Westerns) seemed out of place.It is not the best martial arts film ever, but the choreography is fantastic (that the choreographer also worked on <i>The Matrix </i> comes as no surprise). It's not the most unique or complex storyline, but the characters and plot are unquestionably richer than standard action fare.All in all, it's a worthwhile watch for any type of moviegoer, but a few issues here and there keep this film just a notch below greatness: 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
masterpiece,"CROUCHING TIGER has done the unlikely: legitimize a B-movie genre.  The film works on every level: story, acting, direction.  The action sequences are dazzling and the story is poignant.  Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat are thoroughly convincing as the two elder warriors, and their final scene is among the most touching and poignant in any film I have ever seen.  There is much talk now about Oscar nominations for this film, and it is entirely deserved.  This is all the more impressive when you consider that no one speaks a word of English.  I hope this film wakes up Hollywood to the fact that American audiences will flock to good movies regardless of what language they're spoken in and what country they come from.  Essential viewing in anyone's book.  Period.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Why do people think this film is SO good?,"This film has some pretty good fight choreography.  The weapons battle near the end of the movie is one of the best.  However, I can think of about a dozen Jet Li movies and a dozen Jackie Chan movies with much better fight choreography, so that's not it. The ""love stories"" in this movie are not very good, either.  The one involving the young prodigy is essentially worhtless.  Her love interest really serves no purpose in driving the plot, and you could probably remove that entire sub-plot without losing alot of the movie.  The love story involving Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat is actually pretty interesting, in my opinion.Basically, the movie is pretty good overall.  It's certainly not all that great and not the greatest thing since sliced bread.  If you want to watch a great action movie, check out ""Fist of Legend,"" or if you really want to see Michelle Yeoh, check out ""Twin Warriors (Tai Chi Master)"" or ""Supercop (Police Story 3)"".Come on, people, this movie bombed in China!",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Witless Waste of Time,"Crouching Dragon, Whizzing Tiger is one of the most asinine movies I have ever seen. Full of itself and the overwrought, throwaway ""wisdom"" of the characters' cherished Wudan art, the film grates without relent.The melodramatic fools portrayed in the film spend more time running their fatuous mouths than they do at any actual attempts at ""fighting,"" to use the term very loosely. Particularly annoying is the silly galumphing about in the air that some of the characters do when they aren't flipping around in the dirt missing each other repeatedly with flailing, ineffective blows.Further, their weapons are practically useless in most combats, due to their vast inability to even touch flesh with them, much less pierce it. With all this supposed training, couldn't their ""warriors"" be taught to use a damn firearm? A few well-directed shotgun blasts would dispatch the wallowers in short order. Ang Lee needs to take a cue from Tarantino.Other terribly improbable inanities of the plot include a paralyzation technique performed by some jabs in the ribs, a young girl falling in love with her robber and rapist, a governess who moonlights as a murdering martial arts master and who has wanted posters of her image in many local hands but whom no one can recognize when at her day job, and a poison that supposedly makes the heart pump blood backwards. (What? It makes the heart valves turn around in the vessels? Yeah, right.)Perhaps the most disturbing delusion is the ornate wardrobe and lavish residences in which these creatures of utter fantasy exist. Were the film to show the slightest resemblance to reality, the dire poverty of hundreds of millions of Chinese peasants, the utter filth and disease and death with which they live every day, would be shown.The one positive thing I can say about the film is that the writers for the English overdub were skilled at creating a phonemic pattern of English dialogue that matches somewhat closely the mouth movements of the actors speaking in Mandarin. The English is a creative expression of most of the concepts in the original tongue.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too much hype for an average movie,"I was expecting more from this movie.  To be quite frank, it did not live up to my expectations.

By the way this flick is subtitled for those who did not know - like me before I saw it.

The scenes are beautiful, the score works perfectly to complement the action, and the acting is generally great.

So a few pts seem to drop out, but its a bit like coming into a story, not necessarily in the middle, but at least one which you're familiar with the world for.

One of the most overhyped movies ever...,"This movie was hyped as the fantastic Chinese blockbuster that would open the world's eyes to Chinese movies (or something along those lines). It has indeed worked very well, but here's my personal opinion:1. Far better movies than this have been made in Hong Kong before. Smaller budgets, yes, but far, far better movies.2. The movie has been overhyped. It's good, but not as good, and not as ""deep"" as the advertisers would have us believe.3. No matter how much you read about ""Wuxia pian"" and it's long history, all the flying, running up walls and ""continuous jumping"" (they don't even land between the jumps, they just get near the ground before the cable pulls them up again), is just too ridiculous! You simply have to laugh, because here people are trying to make a serious movie, and suddenly someone stretches out their hand in a very ""Supermanly"" fashion and fly up, up and away! And there's no explanation as to how they can do this, either! What's really sad is that it totally ruins all the swordfights. Why? For the simple reason that fights must either be very stylish, like in The Matrix, or well choreographed/""realistic"" like in many Hong Kong movies. The fights in ""Crouching Tiger..."" are neither. They're not realistic, and totally unfair, because the main characters can use ""magic"" that their opponents can't, but they don't even look cool either, because of the ridiculous cable movements!4. Acting. Even a non-Chinese can see that many of these people are not very good actors. Chow Yun-Fat is as always the greatest, but he has a very small role, so the female actors, who aren't nearly as good as Chow, ""carry"" the movie. Chow Yun-Fat's character is also the most interesting, and coolest character in the movie, so the focus on the female characters is, TBH, difficult to understand.5. Story. The story lacks focus. It seems almost as if the director couldn't decide what part of the story was most important, and thus it lacks the focus that a great movie needs. Also, the characters sometimes act unrealistically (to make the movie last longer?). There's also some ""deep"", philosophical parts, that just don't work well. The ending is the worst example of this ""deepness"" simply being silly.And finally, the Hollywood-feel of it all ruins it somewhat. IMNSHO this movie could've been made in Hollywood, and that takes away a lot of it's character. One of the greatest thing about most Hong Kong and Japanese movies is that they simply couldn't, and wouldn't have, been made in Hollywood.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Peter Pan meets Bruce Lee meets Akira kurosawa = disappointment,"This could have been one the best films of all time, but Ang Lee didn't know what kind of film he wanted to make. Is it an epic, a fantasy, or an action film? The result is a film with a great story, that gets bogged down with an overabundance of fight scenes that are completely too long and unbelievable. I was told by friends that the effects used to create the movement of the characters was revolutionary. Upon viewing, I felt I was watching an oriental version of Peter Pan. It looked as if they were riding invisible stationary bicycles. Their legs would move furiously, yet they would not be touching a wall, and they would climb to the roof of the buildings. The only redeeming quality of this movie was the cinematography.Cut down on the overindulgent fight scenes and the hokey motion effects, and this would have been a film that Kurosawa would have made, if he were alive today.

Ang Lee's first disappointment...,"""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is one of those movies that come to our shores with much pre-release hype.  After all, this has been playing the festival circuit to much praise as well as trophy acquisition.  The hype surrounding this flick has been unavoidable and would serve to show that this film should indeed be the masterpiece that it's been cranked up to be.Unfortunately, ""Crouching"" ends up being a passable film that is quite disappointing on a lot of levels.  While the basic storyline seems to invoke some fun melodrama, diehard martial arts fans will be saddened to see that the fighting scenes are poorly rendered and made unrealistic beyond recognition.  Character development is rather limited and the audience can pretty much determine things from their basic understandings of movies. This is really not the film that it should've been.Basically the story breaks like this.  Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) has to return a famous sword called the ""Green Destiny"" to his master.  He has his friend and secret crush, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) take care of this for him.  There's also a young woman, Jen (Zhang Ziyi) who is engaged in an arranged marriage and ends up having an affair with an outlaw, Lo (Chang Chen).  Since the sword obviously gets stolen, all these characters end up entwined in some way.The thing that has caught many critics' attentions with this film are the action sequences.  I'm saddened to report that for martial arts fans, this will be a major sore spot.  The filmmakers elected to overuse ""wires"" to lift the actors around and have also blended in some digital effects from the ""Romeo Must Die"" school of filmmaking.  I love wire stuff as much as the next fella (check out Jet Li's classic, ""Once Upon A Time In China"" for great usage of this), but this is ridiculous.  All suspension of disbelief is gone once you see these actors fly over the rooftops for long periods of time with minimal effort.  This is not just leaping (which would've made more sense).  Actual lift-off.  Plus, much of the editing distracts from the hand-to-hand combat scenes and this makes it even more obvious to an audience that it never really is that intricate and exciting.  With the minimal impact that these characters have when fighting, it looks more like an art exhibition than a true martial arts film.  This is the film's biggest debit.Next up is something that not many people will notice: the widely varying accents of the actors speaking Mandarin.  Yeoh and Chang seem to have the worst ones and this automatically disqualifies us from believing that the film is set in the early 19th century.  True, this shouldn't be a big deal, but it really becomes distracting as 2/3 of all dialogue seems to have been relooped in post-production, sometimes mid-sentence!  I admire the actors' attempts to get their Mandarin in check (as it certainly isn't easy), esp. Chow Yun-Fat's proper diction (even though just about all his lines are redubbed).  Again, this doesn't affect the majority of viewers.  For those who will notice, this REALLY diverts from their appreciation of the film.So, what really works in ""Crouching""?  Peter Pau's sumptuous cinematography captures the atmosphere of the setting quite well and it's also fun to see Beijing rendered digitally a la ""Phantom Menace.""  The ripe melodrama between the couples is also well-established.  Their situations are rendered in an overwrought fashion that leads to some unintentional laughter.  All that level, the film does succeed and we do see the actors giving what they can to their performances (even with the dialect problem).It's a shame here that the director is Ang Lee, esp. since the guy is a master at films in different genres and settings (""Wedding Banquet,"" ""Sense & Sensibility,"" ""Ice Storm"").  He is truly a brilliant filmmaker, but I think we've found his weakness.  He understands the importance of cultural differences and generation gaps (as well as showing scenes of people eating, something greatly lacking in this film!).  With ""Crouching,"" most of those elements aren't necessary b/c of its sole location.  He has, on the other hand, correctly rendered the feeling of the pulp novels on which this is based in a grand fashion.  Maybe ""Crouching"" would've been better if there were no martial arts at all.  However, the tone of the film keeps shifting. What style is he trying to accomplish here?  One second it's an arty Mainland Chinese epic (in the Zhang Yimou vein of ""Raise The Red Lantern""), the next second an HK B-movie actioner, then a modern Taiwanese soap opera? These elements are too diverse to try and combine successfully in one narrative.So ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" may become the arthouse hit that it's destined to be due to curiosity and hype.  My hope is that those piqued viewers interested in seeing better martial arts epics will come away from this experience in a renting mood.  Go out and try locating the classic 70's Taiwanese martial arts flicks by the underappreciated auteur, King Hu.  Or even any old Jet Li/Jackie Chan/Sammo Hung/Yuen Biao flick will do the trick.  Those martial arts films indeed have the sheer visceral thrills that ""Crouching"" seems to have forgotten completely to accomplish.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Like a stage show of Peter Pan, with sub-titles","I didn't really want to give this movie a 1 out of 10 rating, but I feel the current rating of approximately 9 out of 10 MUST be corrected. The novelty of this movie does NOT justify such a high rating. Yes, the cinematography is great. And, OK, it's interesting to see an epic set in mainland China. BUT, I REALLY could not get over the flying samurai, or whatever you want to call them. I needed the same hookup of wires to get over the large suspension of disbelief needed to swallow such a thing. This was a MAJOR stumbling block for me. And, I know, you could be thinking it's just me, but I tell you the whole theater comically laughed every time the movie's heroes took to the clouds. And yet, when one of them needed to quickly travel to the nearest town to pick up medicine, it was imperative for them to find a horse to travel by! I'm telling you, the whole audience laughed! If it was a Jackie Chan comedy (I haven't seen one yet that has a larger unbelievable premise) I possibly could have gotten over it! But what makes the American distributors of this movie think we want to see Peter Pan with sub-titles! Save your money and go rent Shichinin No Samurai (or Rumble In The Bronx!)",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good and bad, but don't expect too much","First of all, after reviewing the other comments before this, I was surprised at the shallowness of most of the reviews.From a cinematography perspective, the movie is incredible. Ang Lee continues his tradition of beautiful shots. While some people complain about the pacing, as you can see in many other movies, slow pacing is used to build atmosphere and tension. From a western perspective, yes, I also found the movie a bit slow in parts (the whole desert seduction just kept going and going and going,) but from a filmmaking perspective, it is a great achievement.From a cultural perspective, I found the dialogue incredibly bad, not so much for what was written or the character's motivations for saying what they did, but the delivery. Perhaps in China, you can deliver a dramatic line with no pacing or pauses, but in the west it sounds a lot duller.As a kung fu film fan, I was most disappointed with the quality of the fight scenes. Perhaps, Lee looked for the best actors, not necessarialy the best fighters.Also, I am not a big fan of wire-fights. If you watch any of Jackie Chan's movies, or Jet Li's classic ""Fist of Legend,"" you get a true sense of superhumanity, and any wire fights afterwards pale in comparision. (One such incredible actor who will no doubt become a household name in a few years, James Dean Bradley, the white guy in Jackie Chan's woefully underrated and barely released in the US ""Gorgeous,"" is one amazing example.All that being said, I would wholeheartedly recommend seeing this movie, because the story is so strong. Every character has 2 or three different and competing motivations for every single decision they must make, and the decisions they actually make make their character really come alive with complexity and emotion.If I would compare this movie to another, it would be John Woo's ""Last Hurrah for Chivalry."" Again, there is a strong story, lots of wire fighting, and good cinematography.In summary, if you are looking for good fighting, you can wait for the video to see this movie. If you are looking for a good time, then go see it on the big screen.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Asian Awakening,"In one two hour film, the words spiritual, lyrical, mystical and graceful have been shown to me in a way that countless Asian films and  20 years of Kung Fu reruns have tried, but only hinted at.Visually stunning the same way 2001 took my breath away thirty years ago, it is worthy of all the critical praise it has received. The performances by all the actors are extraordinary and it's a shame that of the 10 Oscar nominations it received, Michelle Yeoh or Zhang Ziyi were not among them.

Opportunity Wasted,"This could have been one of the best movies, but alas! It is not. It is a visual spectacle that is indeed stunning, and it has martial arts choreography that is beautiful and unique. At least  I have never seen anything like that before.However, one thing without which no movie can even be regarded a good movie, the ability to move audience's heart is COMPLETELY missing. The plot is non-existent, which is contrary to any other movie that is regarded as an epic.The goal that hero of the movie is fighting for is so pathetically trivial that it means nothing to me whether he succeeds or not. He is NOT fighting for love, for romance, for country, for honor, for family, for good(against evil), but instead he is pursuing a spoiled teenage girl who has come into possession of a ""book of martial arts secrets"", and  has shown some talent. He is willing to give up his life and his heroine's life so this retarded girl will accept his as his teacher.As I said above, this movie has characters that do not have any higher purpose. An emotionally unstable girl is hardly a worthy cause for a man of hero's capabilities to be wasted.Ang Lee wasted an opportunity to create one of the greatest Romantic epics. He could have exploited the opportunity for creating a romantic triangle between the two leading women and the hero. Instead he focused solely on the cinematography and martial arts choreography (and did a tremendous job) and created a movie without any objective or purpose. Two many noble characters wasted for NO cause at all. The battle in this movie is not between ""Good and Evil"", but between ""Obsessive (hero) vs retarded (heroine)"" (who have NO feeling for each other what so ever).",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Didn't live up to expectations,"I guess I am not much of a fan of fantasy-type stories, but from all the rave reviews of this film, I thought there would be more drama to this story.  However, I was disappointed. I found the story to be similar to Star Wars -- you know, the battle for the child between the good and the evil, that type of thing -- but not as exciting or even as complex.  And, apart from the flying fight scenes (I particularly liked the one in the treetops), I didn't find it as visually interesting as Star Wars.But worse, I found this film to be somewhat slow and talky, especially at the beginning.  Now, I can understand and speak Mandarin, and being able to hear their conversation did not make it any more interesting. In fact, I thought their voices were stilted and pretty much devoid of any expression.Okay, it was reasonably entertaining, but emotionally, it didn't grab me at all.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Best Movie I have ever seen.,I went along to this movie curious about why the Director won the Golden Globe and noting that the movie got a 9 out of 10 on IMDB.  I had never seen a 9 before and my expectations were great.  I was not disappointed. Everything about this movie entranced me.  I found this a beautiful and dramatic experience that caused me to open those areas of my imagination that only truly poetic masterpieces can do.

"A fine movie, but by no means a great movie","Yes, I admit this movie was quite enjoyable, but great?  I would argue against its greatness and longevity.  The story line was standard with few surprises.  A magic sword that brings out the power of the person possessing it, King Arthur anyone?  The filming was fantastic, the fight scenes entertaining, but the character development was non-existent.  The romance was forced, and forced poorly through a half-hour flash back more than an hour into the movie.  I almost fell asleep at that point.I'm sure that I missed something in this movie, since I am one of the only people I know that wasn't blown away by this film, but this movie is no best picture.

Give me Jackie Chan any day,"Rarely have I been so disappointed in a film. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon had been highly praised in all the national and international reviews available, leading a moderately full cinema last Friday night to expect an interesting plot, exciting fight scenes and visual artistry. Instead, the audience soon became restless.My most damning criticism has to be that for the first time ever I found a film dull within minutes of its opening. Our row of seats consumed unheard-of quantities of chocolate and popcorn to compensate for the obvious lack of tension. We remained uninterested in the fate of the protagonists throughout and considered leaving the film before the end but stayed on because we did not fancy braving the sub-zero temperature outside.Having seen several older films of genre on television, I had looked forward to the first fight scene. The audience collectively leant back to enjoy the fun, watched for a while and then started sniggering. Not only are the fight scenes not particularly well choreographed, they are astonishingly badly filmed. Instead of filming them like dance sequences, i.e. as full body shots, the film's makers give us small snippets of arms flashing in front of faces. There are countless multiple somersaults ending in about a second of slowing-down, like a rocket going into reverse acceleration, where the special effects people have obviously had to play around in order to have the actor appear to land on the ground and not several inches about it. The ""best"" bit in the entire film was when a character flew off, body rigid, one arm stretched out above his head. At least half a dozen voices in the cinema, including mine, simultaneously cried out ""Superman.""Give me Jackie Chan any day!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolutely beautiful piece...a must see!,"I've seen quite a few Chinese martial art/sword-fighting movies before but none like this one ever! Ang Lee's Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is something very different, unique & breath-takingly beautiful.Even if you're not interested in all those scenic beauties of China, wonderfully composed & played scores, great acting from talented Chinese actors, or a meaningful ending, you'll definitely find the skillfully & artfully constructed fighting sequences absolutely beautiful!!!

The movie had an aesthetic beauty to it that is unlike anything I had seen before it.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who's old enough to read the subtitles.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A World Masterpiece,"Ang Lee's film is a lyrical masterpiece, rightfully noted by the American Film Institute as ""bringing the world together."" Heavily weighted in Eastern philosophy and tradition, ""Crouching Tiger"" accessibly brings Asian film to Western audiences. The film begins by slowly setting the stage for the romance subplot between Chow Yun Fat's ""Mu Bai"" and Michelle Yeoh's ""Shu Lien"". The fan expecting all action may find this initial opening slow. However, the more estute fan will recognize this as the necessary build-up. Les the action fan get bored, the fights kick up a mere ten minutes into the film, and when they do, boy, is he paid off.  The initial fight scene introduces the audience to an audacious display of superior martial artistry.  Anyone who thought the use of the word ""arts"" in ""martial arts"" was a stretch will be proved wrong. The choreography in this initial battle is pure bliss.  Every time you think they can't outdo themselves, believe me, they do. With each subsequential fight, you think you've seen the best, but then Ang Lee, moving himself into the world canon of directors, tops them all with a fight at the top of a bamboo forest that will literally leave you in awe. This viewer has seen too many films in his lifetime, but ""Crouching Tiger"" really brought back the magic of going to the movies. It truly lifts you to a place where you've never been.  I, again, felt like the six year old who saw ""Star Wars"", and to recapture that feeling 25 years later was cinematic bliss. Go.  And then go again.  The new millennium has just begun, but Ang Lee has given other filmmakers a peak to reach for.  ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is the ""Star Wars"" for the world economy. Subtitles or no, it is the greatest film in decades, and, I believe, for decades to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Epic fantasy movie, easily misunderstood","If you're a big fan of traditional Kungfu movies from Jet Li & Bruce Lee... stay away from this film.  There are better Kung Fu flicks around.If you enjoyed The Matrix for all its coolness, stay away from this film. There are better Adrenaline-pumping action flicks around.If you enjoy movies for what they are, then you'll love this film.  It's the kind of movie where you *must* leave your expectations at the door... otherwise you won't enjoy the experience.Don't misunderstand -- the action sequences are truly amazing.  It's not the best kungfu movie because it relies too much of wire-fu special FX.  But if you judge them as action sequences (not kungfu sequences) they're clearly the best EVER put in the silver screen.  Far exceeds the Matrix sequences. To the untrained eye (99% of the population) the martial arts appear authentic... unlike Keanu Reeves & Lawrence Fishburne in The Matrix.But people who watch this movie expecting a blockbuster action flick WILL NOT enjoy it.  These action sequences appear only intermittenly, and much of the movie is filled with dialogues & beautiful scenes.  People who want adrenaline-pumping movies are better off renting Die-Hard or any John Woo movie (Face Off, Mission Impossible 2).People who see this movie expecting a wonderful storyline should think twice.  The plot is good, but basic --- afterall, it's based on Chinese folklore.  The plot resembles a parable more than it does an actual storyline.  Think (Oscar-winning) ""Unforgiven"" by Clint Eastwood.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a great movie because it takes the viewers into a different place.  I don't speak Chinese, but I'll be darned if I even remember reading subtitles during the movie.  That's how engrossing the film is: You forget that you've been reading subtitles all along, and imagine that you understood the spoken dialogue.Beautiful scenery, wonderful actors, and a storyline based on a world Hollywood has never seen before.  Imagine watching the first Western ever created.  You would've been blown away with the concept of Cowboys, Sheriffs, and High-Noon shootouts.  Likewise, this movie is just so *fresh* and *new* to people who've never heard of the Chinese Wu Xia tales.This film is quite simply awe-inspiring.I'd rate it 9.7/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon Blends Action with Art","Perhaps the best movie of 2000 so far, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" sees Chow Yun-fat (Li Mu Bai) and Michelle Yeoh (Yu Shu Lien) return to glory in this action-packed period piece based on Du Lu Wang's ""Giang Hu"" novels. With dazzling special effects and Yuen Wo Ping's (The Matrix) virtuoso martial arts choreography, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" leaves recent kung-fu flicks ""Shanghai Noon"" and ""Romeo Must Die"" in the dust.  But the real star of the movie may be Zhang Ziyi (Jen), who starred in last year's ""The Road Home"" directed by Zhang Yimou (no relation).  Not coincidentally, perhaps, Zhang looks very much like a youthful Gong Li.  Matching Yeoh's athletic prowess with her balletic grace, Zhang plays Jen as an on-screen contradiction of innocence and sensuality.  At one point in the film, Zhang asks Chow Yun-fat, ""Is it the sword that you want, or is it me?"" echoing the inner-thoughts of the males in the audience.  With a balanced script, the breathless cinematography of China by Peter Pau (The Killer), the star-power of Zhang, Chow and Yeoh, and the perfect mix of action and drama by director Ang Lee, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" seamlessly combines the genres of action and ""art"", raising the ante of martial arts films for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
sucked in by Sino cinema hype,"Yes this is a beautifully photographed film. So what! I didn't pay my hard earns to watch a promo for tourism in mainland China. Call me crazy but when I go to the cinema I like to se a solid plot in conjunction with characters I can emphasize with. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon provided neither for me.At one stage I thought I was watching a Chinese version of Peter Pan as actors miraculously walked up walls and zoomed across tree tops. I don't have a problem with fantasy but hey guys it would nice to have the ground rules set up before evaporating any historical realism.I admit martial arts set pieces leave me cold and this film did nothing to change my opinion in this respect. Maybe it's cultural I don't know but those staged fights left me cold. After a while we knew the ball busting chic was unstoppable so it came as no surprise she wasted all the guys in the Chinese version of the old west bar. I got to tell you I had no sympathy for this character. To me she was a privileged spoiled brat who deserved a bit of pay back. The way she treated that barbarian suitor. Why did he put up with her s**t? I would have been interested in the back story to that.Instead we're treated to cliché city. Just because this film is Chinese and beautifully shot doesn't make it a masterpiece. I'm gratified to see that other user comments are also critical. So they should be. If eye candy and clichés is what you're after go for it. For me there are much better films around this year.

What was Ang Lee thinking? It is embarrassing.Am I wrong?No one was a winner in this movie.

one of the most beautiful films ever to grace cinemas everywhere,"I have just got back from watching Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon for the third time in less than a week. I have been to see it practically every other day during the half term with my friends. (Note: This movie has great date potential!)There will be those that will come away from CTHD disappointed. This does not reflect on the content of the film, but rather the individuals in question. This film has been nominated for 10 Oscars and 14 BAFTAs (the British equivalent) and should, in my opinion, deserve more. It seems that the general public isn't as stupid as previously thought and will actually pay good money to see a subtitled film, if they think it is in their interest.The storyline is set in the Qing dynasty, in 19th Century China, a time of strict morals and high expectations of the young. With such masterpieces as ""The Ice Storm"" and ""Ride With the Devil"", (bizarrely enough, shown for less than 3 weeks in UK cinemas) Ang Lee has proved himself to be one of the most versatile, intelligent people working in modern cinema today.I won't regurgitate on what countless numbers of people have already written here; but for me, there are very similar and interesting lines drawn here that overlap what 'American Beauty' and similar dramas are trying to tell us. It seems to me that CTHD is a daring story about the courage it takes to be yourself, in the same vein as other dramas of the year. (American Beauty, Boys Don't Cry) Intelligent, discerning people should come away from this movie and reflect on the hidden ideas that Ang Lee is trying to relate to us - what is our place in society? why do we conform to authority? etc.The other thing is, if you're a martial arts fanatic and are expecting a full-blown studio production along the lines of Jackie Chan / Jet Li, you will be very disappointed. This is NOT an all-out, hi-octane adventure. What it is, however, is a beautiful passionate look at values of old and contrasting them with society today. (Sometimes I feel like I'm repeating myself over and over...and I wonder why I am bothering. Words fail to do this film justice.)Newcomer Zhang Zi Yi is one of the most haunting young faces to grace cinema screens today. I get the impression that the writer must have almost written the part for her - it is as though she has some kind of inherent haughtiness in her. Her expression can be read in more than one way at some points in the film and there is a definite unpredictable element in her attitude to the circumstances. Moreover, this film shows humanity, as American Beauty did. It shows compassion and caring.People go to see films to be entertained, excited, and taken on a ride for a couple of hours. CTHD does this and so much more, this is moral therapy of the very highest order. It is a soulful action 'epic' that every man, woman, and child on the face of the planet should be taken to.To summarise, this is definitely worth your money and time. You won't be disappointed leaving the cinema, and I don't mind admitting that I was crying at the end - I definitely wasn't the only one either. One half of the audience sat there slack-jaw, the other half were openly crying and it reminds me of the society that was, before all this materialism has entered into our lives. CTHD is a wake-up call that must be echoed everywhere. And of course, you always get the small minority, destined to be ignorant forever. Of course, these are the people that laugh at the graceful martial arts...and these are the people that have the collective IQ of a wet fish.Despite my 16 years it is not hard to see why so many people have hailed this film as truly worthy of gongs come Oscar-time.The level of humanity and moral destiny on screen was just too great to bear. My only concern is that some of the dramatic impact is lost when the film is transferred from big screen to small screen...is there any chance of a global re-release?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
More than just Kung Fu,"This is a magical film, both because of its subject, and its treatment by Ang Lee who is proving himself to be a veritable magician of cinema. In addition to the martial arts and wire assisted ""flying"" scenes which are breathtaking, the sets and scenery are spectacular. There is always something on the screen to delight the eye, while the ear is beguiled by atmospheric music featuring Yo-yo Ma's cello.The main story is essentially a simple framework on which to drape this rich tapestry of cinematic action, spectacle and sound - a precious sword is stolen, and must be recovered. But there are several sub-plots, including a classic love story, part of which moves the action from densely decorated and crowded sets in the city and palaces to the vast amber-coloured, empty desert. The acting is in a different convention to the general run of American or European movies, being more stilted and formal, but this is soon replaced by exuberant displays of energy, agility and mobility in the fight scenes!One feature of the movie which has perhaps not received as much attention as it might is that this is a great feminist movie.  Not just  because two of the main protagonists are women (Michelle Yeoh and Zang Ziyi), who provide much of the martial arts action; but because their skill is accepted on its own merits by the male characters in the film, without the astonished, resentful or jokey comments we might normally expect in an American or European movie.It may be that there are some people reluctant to see Tiger because they view it simply as a Kung Fu film, and do not like that genre. If so, they should overcome their resistance, because they are missing something quite wonderful.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a note about advertising and marketing,"One thing: films that are marketed everywhere and advertised everywhere are not always great films. I can remember a particular 'The Matrix' being advertised a couple of years ago, but think about it people!Here's a classic example:The only reason why car company Ford advertises its cars with such frequency is because they are ****! They are bog standard and are nothing special. It's the same way with a film...a great film doesn't need advertising to lure people to see it, it should do it by its strength and power alone. (Hannibal, anyone?)I also see no point in drawing comparisons with 'The Matrix' as this and CTHD are two entirely different films. I found 'The Matrix' to be a cheap, quick, hi-octane kind of tomato ride, with an impenetrable plot and some good 'wow' kung fu - good for your couple of hours but not worth a repeat viewing, you know what I mean? There is so much more depth and intrinsical beauty to CTHD that it deserves to beat all other contenders for the Oscars this year... Gladiator was good but it was hardly spectacular, CGI effects abound as normal, as we have lately come to expect from Hollywood, and of course Traffic...well, both Gladiator and Traffic aren't bad films in their own right but I'm afraid I'll be rooting for CTHD come Oscar night.I give CTHD these marks out of 10 for each category:Performances from Leads: (Michelle Yeoh, Chow Yun Fat) 10/10 I have never, in living memory, seen such a subtle love exist on the screen.Performances from Supports: (Chang Chen, Zhang ZiYi) 10/10 These performances are enough to put the best Hollywood performances of late out of their misery...quite literally, expect some slack-jaw moments as every trick in the book is utilised to add 'line' to the overall visceral shape.Artistic Impression:       10/10 Possibly some of the most beautiful locations you will ever see in a film, the night chase, the city, and the desert, this is one rollercoaster of a film that never lets up. And of course the level of detail - the costumes, the ruts in the road for the carriage in the city, and interior design. Effects are used appropriately and yes, it is true that in the documentary with Ang Lee, he said he didn't want to use CGI effects for the wind in the tree-top scene because he felt that computers couldn't duplicate the effect of swaying tree tops in the dense forest. It's the strength of statements like that alone that are true testaments to the sheer power of CTHD, but anyway, we're digressing :)Sound:       10/10 Not a hair out of place, metaphorically speaking, in this category. Sound effects are always appropriate and have just the right amount of weight to this to make it seem authentic, which is as it should be.Music:       10/10 Always used in appropriate places, this film features some haunting cello solos from Yo-Yo Mah. If you are into beautiful 'a capella' (unaccompanied) music, you will definitely love this. Texture is rich and always has the right pitch, volume, and tone.Cinematography:     8/10 Almost full marks in this category, but I felt that the cinematography fell down as the film goes on and on. Is there a logical progression of images that are utilised in the film? I felt it was conjured up in a somewhat haphazard fashion. Peter Pau certainly knows how to control the pace of a film, though; some quick, arousing battle scenes contrasted against the desert, dragging on and on for seemingly infinite length.Direction:    10/10 You couldn't really ask more from a director, and Ang Lee gives it his best shot, and boy, what a shot that is. Camera angles are graceful and filled with splendour, so that even in the most basic of conversations at Sir Te's home, you will see all the detail that Ang Lee intended you to see. Top marks - absolutely brilliant.TOTAL MARKS:      68 / 70 Summary: One of the best films I have seen in the past 6 years of my life. Consistently outclasses others when I make comparisons to other works such as 'Clockwork Orange', 'American Beauty', etc. and all the other films that think they have something to say about society. My only wish is that (1) there is a global re-release in cinemas everywhere and (2) there should be more films like this. This is film-making of the very highest order.Jaz",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Oscar here we come!,"Not expecting much and not being into subtitles, my spouse dragged me out to see another ""martial arts"" dime a dozen film.  Well, I was very pleasantly surprised by one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen.  It's sure to be a fierce competitor to Gladiator on March 25. The story flowed so nicely and didn't have a lot of background junk going on so you really could focus on the story.  Bravo Mr Lee!  I can't wait to see it again!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great scenery, but lacking substance.","We saw this movie in an art house with a great sound system in the town that we live in.  Everything visually was stunning, but at the end, we were left with the feeling that it was incomplete.  The fight scenes were excellent, but we could have lived without seeing so much flying.  Yes, I know this is a fairy tale, but this was a distraction.  All in all, a good but not great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

What am I missing here?,"I'm really in the minority on this one but I did not especially care for this film.  The good points:  it was visually beautiful and peopled with stunningly attractive actors wearing lovely costumes.  The score was compelling.  I didn't mind the subtitles at all; reading the words as I hear them in another language, rather than being a hindrance, adds another level of depth for me.  But....The plot sequence sometimes seemed confusing and choppy.  I often wondered where the action was taking place (except during the delightful desert scenes, which were my favourite in the movie.)  I thought the fight scenes were too long, hyperactive-looking (even frenetically robotic when compared with the graceful leaps across the rooftops), and not especially amazing. I love fantasy but didn't find much (beyond the deviance of gravity) that seemed fantastical.  I liked looking at the characters and their expressive faces, but couldn't empathise with them; character development seemed quite minimal to me.  I'm finding it hard to see beneath the story's surface and discover layers of symbolism and meaning there.I don't watch martial arts films per se and don't know much about the various philosophies of such.  Does this position hurt or help me in understanding this film?  I don't know.  I suppose it hurts but the vast majority of the American public doesn't know much about Wu Xia, I suspect, and they love the film!  I wanted to like it.  Typically, I find foreign films fascinating and revel in seeing gripping stories of people from other cultures.  (I loved Raise The Red Lantern, which I kept thinking of during the viewing of this film.)The bottom line is this:  I am a crouching pariah among rabid dragons!  I just feel blank regarding what is so incredibly wonderful about this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Waste of my money,"This movie was boring from the start.  With a plot that just didn't make much sense in English, and references to history that the American culture knew nothing about, this movie just went over everyones heads, and into our pockets.  I totally got bored, and was more entertained by watching how many people started in the fully packed theatre, watching them leave, then noticing the empty theatre at the end.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Final fantasy,"First of all, I have to say I was disappointed by the start of this film. The story, about a magical sword and a coterie of fighting monks, is pure 'Star Wars', and the fight scenes (viewed purely as such) are spectacular, and sometimes funny, but never convincing (and notice almost no-one dies: in one scene, Zhang Zhiyi's character, who continually fights with mighty swords, nonetheless expresses horror that someone actually got hurt in a fight).  We now live in the age of second generation special effects, which exist not to feign reality but to outdo it, which is in a way quite pointless - the most gripping scene in 'The Matrix' for me was the one where Keanu Reeves nearly fell off the skyscraper; once he got his magic powers, all my interest waned.But 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' grew on me as it went on.  For a start, it's one of the most beautiful films I have seen, with stunning images and music.  And once you start to see the outrageous movement of the characters as a kind of music too, rather than as plot, the film gains charm.  Though there is variation in tone, skilfully handled by director Ang Lee, everything in this fantastical world is logically and aesthetically consistent, and gradually it envelopes you.  And in spite of all the fighting, the film does not fetishise weaponry, in sharp contrast to the trigger-happy 'Matrix'.Plus there are three strong, individual, female characters, all-well acted, and a great performance from Chun Yow Fat in the leading role. And a subtle tale of unexpressed love that surprises one with the force that it carries at the denouement.So enjoy the trickery with wires, and then ignore it.  This is an old fashioned film in modern clothes:  an epic, beautiful tearjerker, and none the worse for that.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Epic Fantasy,"I was unsure what to expect from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.  I didn't see the film until everyone and their dogs had an opinion on its excellence or its failure.  When I finally found the courage - or resolve - to see the film, I was surprisingly delighted.What I noticed first about the film was the amazing panoramic images of China.  The cinematography in this film is unmatched (with the sole exception of LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring, set in New Zealand).  The film itself was beautiful, and contained all the elements necessary for a truly successful fantasy.  It had memorable characters, beautiful scenery, some comic relief, intelligent fight scenes, and most importantly, a moral. The fact that it revolves around a love story is an added treat (think: Star Wars).This film delights the senses, and whisks you away into the lives of each character.  The mandarin language adds a romantism to the film as well.  For a movie that was so highly disputed, I find myself on the side that whole-heartedly approves of its brilliance.If you have not yet watched the film, do it, regardless of any negativity that you may have heard.  Just the experience of the film, whether you find you like it or not, is worth the time spent.I rate it a compelling 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Entertaining, but quite shallow.","Although Ang Lee is known to be unpredictable, a year ago I would never have guessed his next film would be a kung fu one. Being an admirer of Mr. Lee's work, I had high hopes for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Perhaps Lee could bring new life into a weary genre. The positive critique kept my hopes up, and I couldn't wait to see the film. Now I have, and I must admit I was disappointed.Not to sound too negative, I'll begin by telling what I did like in Crouching Tiger etc. The visuals are, of course, magnificent. The fight scenes tread the fine line between beauty and silliness, but never fall into the latter category. The cinematography is both elegant and dynamic, and the film excels in production and costume design as well. The actors do a decent job, and yes, for a kung fu flick Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has unusual depth. Neverthless, all the above can't hide the fact that this is Ang Lee's worst film.There are serious themes in the film, but they never become interesting enough. There are four essential subjects in the film: Li Mu Bai's and Yu Hsui Lien's suppressed love, Jen's and Lo's impossible romance, Jen's desire to exceed Mu Bai and Hsui Lien in fighting skills, and the daughter/apprentice relationship Jade Fox has with Jen. Sadly, none of these dramatic archs has time develop properly between the fight scenes and the other three stories. The lessons taught in the end sound banal, partly because one hasn't rooted enough with the characters. The final scene is both predictable and unnecessary; one suspects it was added for visual effect only.Paradoxically, had Crouching Tiger... been merely an entertaining kung fu flick, I probably would've liked it more. Now it tries to be both entertainment and deep drama, and succeeds only on the former department. One is compelled to compare the drama with Lee's former films, and on that comparison Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon reveals it's shallowness. Also, though better than this one, Ang Lee's previous film Ride with the Devil had the same tendency to prefer surface over substance. I hope winning all the Oscars doesn't give Ang Lee the impression that this is the direction he should be heading for. I, for once, would like to see more Ice Storms and less Crouching Tigers.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Chinese dream world ""comes true""","First, I'd like to say that I'm from Taiwan. I love this movie very much.However, many of my friends think the movie is just ok, because there are so many similar stories written in the books which we(Chinese) have read since we can read.  But we all agree that this movie virtualize those stories into the best form that you can see, you can hear and you can feel.  There is always some feeling that you can't express.  Movies can do that, can speak for you.  That's how I feel about this movie.  It represents part of our culture.  Of course,  we understand the beauty of it more.  For those who dislike the movie, I am sorry to say that you may not like our culture. Just like some people, such as my bf, don't like Chinese food, or think they like the American-Chinese food.  For those how like the movie and you see the deep part of the movie, I thank you for ""trying"" to understand our culture.  I may not say all the culture in that movie are good.  But I thank you to open your mind to us.  Just like we try so hard to understand American jokes, I know it's so hard for trying.I should say this is NOT a martial arts movie, at least not the kind what is well-known by Americans.  It's the DREAM of our ancient martial arts.  That's why we love it.  It's our dream, not yours.  The flying thing, of course, seems to be not realistic, same as that the mental power thing in ""Star Wars"" is so funny to me.  My bf used to hope that I would like ""Star Wars"" and ""South Park"", but he failed.  Now I know it's because we have different cultures.  So if you dislike the movie, maybe you should realize that you can't like most of Chinese culture.  It's not the kind of the martial arts you want, not the love you understand and not the life attitude you can imagine in your culture.   And I am very sorry.About the English subtitles, if you dislike this movie because you hate the subtitles, please be more patient.  You should be thankful for living in such an environment where is full of the movies in your language.  For us, we watch all non-Chinese movies with Chinese subtitles (EVERY SINGLE movie from American, specially there are tons of American movies made each year.). So if you want to watch this Chinese movie, accept the subtitle. You have no right to judge it if you are having problem reading the subtitle.  It's a movie for Chinese and everyone is welcome to enjoy it.  But it should keep its original language.  We don't expect Julia Roberts ""speaks"" Chinese in her movie.  So don't complain too much on the Chinese audio as well.  It's not designed ONLY for you.On more thing.  I love Matrix very much. However, I would not compare this movie with Matrix, because they are totally different.  The only same part is that they are all unrealistic in action parts.At the end, I want to rate it 9 of 10, as a Chinese ; If I were an American, it would be 5 from not understanding it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ron the Anglophile,"As with last year, 2001 has got off to a cracking start.  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon came with five star credentials.  Now experience is that such enthusiasm for a film - that isn't from the USA, (where hype comes as standard), or from the UK, (where local reviewers are just pleased to see anything!) - is justification for an early view before the art houses file their prints away in the ""no-one came"" drawer.Well!  Yes and no.It's martial arts for heaven's sake!  Frequently performed by high kicking women!  Sarah Michelle Geller/Cameron Diaz playing it half laughs/half lust? No, no!  Michelle Yeoh & Ziyi Zhang; and let's not forget - Ang Lee.  I'll admit it.  Fifteen minutes into the film I nearly stood up and applauded the first roof top fight sequence.  It was that good!  But then the second and third were merely only OK.  It was the fifth, or was it the sixth? - dancing through the trees - that reminded me that special effects can actually be special.  Some nice location stuff too.Ron (Viewed 6Jan2001)(Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon?  It's got to be rude!)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Gorgeous Movie,"After watching a ton of movies, and a lot of drivel, this is the one movie that reminds me just how good movies should and can be.

Some complain that its not realistic, or its too stylized, etc... Okay, fine, let them go make a movie.  Thank God for Ang Lee's vision and creativity.  A movie, at its best, presents a reflection of the human condition, humorously or dramatically, realistic or not.  This film hits all those details of life-love, loyalty, honor, duty, freedom, joy, despair, wanting things you can not have, missed opportunities and still manages to be a happy escape from the ordinary. How many of us can craft a piece of art to do the same?  if you haven't already, give this one a chance.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Excellent, but overrated","Rating: 7/10Sorry if this sounds at all snide... Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a visually stunning movie, but so was Twister.  So was Jurassic Park.  So was (shudder) Armageddon.  What actually made Crouching Tiger so much better than these other movies, and worthy of Academy notice?  OK, so the fight scenes were incredible... better than I've seen before, certainly.  But weren't the tornadoes in Twister equally impressive?Plot?  The plot of Crouching Tiger wasn't much deeper than these other films I've mentioned.  I know many will disagree with that statement, and feel free to.  Let's see... Sword stolen... wild teenager with incredible power... two seasoned warriors chasing after... this could be the plot of a Conan The Barbarian movie, couldn't it?Was it the acting, then?  Forgive me for sounding like a typical American, but it is hard to judge acting in a language you do not understand.  It seemed excellent to me (and, yes, far better than the ""acting"" in Armageddon) but nothing that really made anyone's hair stand on end.Directing/Cinematography/Sound?  OK, so this was clearly one of the most beautiful movies I've ever seen.  It was truly masterfully done.  But is that enough?  Again, this comes back to the whole comparison with other ""pure"" visual movies.Actually, the movie this seems most fitting to compare to, for me, would be ""A Thin Red Line"", another visually stunning, well acted (but not TOO well acted) essentially plotless art film.  Enjoyable, but not deserving of an excellent rating.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Am I the only one who thought this movie sucked?,"In China this movie was a huge bomb. How is it then that they simply slap subtitles on it and it becomes a hit in the United States? Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is supposed to a sweeping epic of expert warriors and forbidden love. I didn't see any of that. Yes, the fight scenes were cool, but you've already seen this stuff in The Matrix. The matrix also had a decent story-line to keep you interested between fight sequences. This movie however has a laughable attempt at a plot and an even worse ending. If you need to see a crouching tiger, go to the zoo and watch a tiger poop.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Thank goodness, I thought I was the only one disappointed","Someone else in these comments referred to ""The Emperor's New Clothes"", and that's just what I was thinking about when I left the theatre.  I was wondering whether my husband and I were the only ones who wanted to shout ""But he has nothing on!"".We don't go to the movies much, so when we go, we try to make sure that we'll see something really good that will justify the cost of the babysitter, admission, and popcorn.  So I'm doubly disappointed - that the movie wasn't better, and that we spent all that money for little reward.I'll be the first to admit that I'm a Westerner who's incredibly ignorant about Chinese culture.  Also, I'm not good with subtlety.  I need to be hit over the head to get the point of movies and books, which is why I love schlock like ""Independence Day"".  However, I KNEW that ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" wouldn't be that kind of movie, and I was prepared for that. I knew that there'd be subtitles, and that was fine.  What I wasn't prepared for was the incredible slowness of the plot.  Chow Yun Fat is such a talented actor - why, oh why, was he so wooden in this movie?  We kept hearing about the great unrealized love between his character and Michelle Yeoh's:  why did we see absolutely no evidence of this?  I kept wanting to scream ""STOP YAPPING AND JUST KISS HER, ALREADY!"".Also, the ""flying"".  I'm sorry, but to me it just looked silly.  I knew there'd be wire work, and I was looking forward to it - I thought I'd see the actors' moves aided and exaggerated slightly by the wires.  I didn't expect to see them FLOAT.  I was one of the ignoramuses who giggled when Jen leapt across a lake, touching down one toe for a microsecond before taking off again.  It didn't look graceful or balletic to me; it looked phoney as hell.  As for the ending - well, just as I was thinking ""That can't be the end"", on come the closing credits.  Oh well.  That was one of the few times I've ever been relieved to see the closing credits.My husband and I discussed the movie afterwards, and we were both bewildered.  Were we missing something?  Why were all the critics raving about it when we were so disappointed?  So I got on IMDB the first chance I got - and what a relief to see that so many of you feel the same way!",,Anonymous,Fantasy

There were a few moments in the film that were really breathtaking, but for the most part the film as a whole was not spectacular. Also, I always hate to rail against the endings of movies, but this one I just did not get. It was completely abrupt and seemed out of place given the two hours of story that preceded it.

Yo Peng's movies existed way back to the 80's. Bamboo jungly fight scene are very common in WuXia world, nothing ridiculous about that.2.) From my Asian point of view, the fight scene only worth about 7/10. For a 10/10 fight scene, watch Jet LI's Once Upon A Time In China series. AKA Wong Fei Hung. There's difference between martial artist who fight and actors who pretends they can fight.3.)

What is all the fuss over???,"After reading movie reviews and listening too all the acclaim for this film, I finally went to see it with high hopes, expecting an epic.  About an hour into the film, I realized that not only was this movie FAR FAR from an epic (such as a Gladiator or a Braveheart), but it wasn't even good.  The action sequences made ""X-men"" look realistic.  Indeed, they would be more at home in a Mortal Kombat movie.  The fighting itself was fairly well done, but certainly nothing you haven't seen recently in any number of other films. What really puzzles me is how anyone (above the age of 10) can honestly say that this movie has much of a plot.  It is transparent from the start, and is basically a rehash of any number of earlier films (including dozens of B movie martial arts flicks).  I was tempted to get up from my seat and leave about half way through the movie during the ""desert romance"" sequence that interrupted the progression of the main plot for 20 minutes are so, while convincing me that this is quite possible the most overrated movie of all time.

The flying in the fight scenes just amazed me and the bamboo tree scenes near the end are to beautiful for words.Only complaint, one of the special effects near the end of the movie looked rather cheesy.'Wo Hu Cang Long' is a medium paced martial arts film, combined with a touching romantic story, and a nice, if at times a little slow (not a bad thing in this case), look at Chinese culture.

Michelle Yeoh was not nominated for an Oscar, but should have been and should have won.....The most natural Martial Arts movie I have ever seen. And I have seen hundreds of them in the seventies and eighties. In all the martial arts were the most important piece of the movie, even in the Bruce Lee ones.  The story was made up around the martial art scenes. In ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" we see some breath taking action that is clearly a part of the whole story.That is why this movie is not strictly a Martial Arts movie, but a brilliant fantasy tale within the Chinese culture during the Han dynasty.What can be said of the characters....I have seen no weak performances at all. But, again, the performance of Michelle Yeoh as Shu Lien has literally taken my breath away......I do not know the superlatives to describe her performance.What can be said of the movie......All became silent, all were in awe....all loved......10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"fine, fast, and funny","The wire work takes a little getting used to; sometimes it seems unintentionally comic.  The times when I was most sold on it where when a character would race up the side of a wall, spinning, the wall suddenly the plane which the ground would have been.  This makes the most sense; if, to whatever degree, we're dispensing with gravity, then why is all of the flying simply up/down rather than on other planes?That aside, the story is quite good even if I have some reservations about the ending.  That ending probably reads differently to Westerners than Easterners; what we see as a final selfish act might be considered noble halfway around the world.  Regardless -- good acting (especially by the fellow who plays Lo) and a good dose of humor throughout keeps things pumping.  Good stuff, among the year's ten best.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Great FANTASY Movie,"In response to the negative reviews on the ""flying"" part:Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a movie based on a ""FANTASY"" novel.  These types of novels and comic books are very popular in Chinese culture. In fact, the popularities have spread throughout the Far East for many years.In this FICTIONAL world, hero and warriors have extraordinary skills. They can do ""weightless leap"" (not flying) because they can make their bodies light as a feather, and yes, if they hit somebody on the right positions they can paralyze them. they just can. They can because they're not in our world, they're in a fantasy world.We watch movies and read fantasy novels for entertainment. It is the only way we could enter another world. Be open-minded and we will be able to enjoy limitless imaginations.  Otherwise, what's the point of going to see a movie?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Obviously I am in the minority thinking that movies still do need plot and character development more than they need action scenes. Waste of time, money, and space on the Top 250 list.

A remarkable film,"I've never been much of an Ang Lee fan, but this film quickly made me one. While I enjoyed the Ice Storm, this film reinvented Chinese cinema as we know it. Granted, it meant nearly breaking the bank to make the film, but the style and artistry was amazing. Yeun Woo Ping did a spectacular job of choreographing this film, even though his greatest achievement thus far is turning Keanu Reeves into a respectable martial artist. After watching this movie, I can't wait for Zu Warriors to tumble into town. But, I also have to feel bad for Ang Lee when he made this film. Just imagine, if this film didn't do well, he would probably become just another good `foreign director. ' Let's just hope The Hulk isn't some bad comic book turned into movie.

Fresh air in the movie-world,"Crouching Tiger.. was the movie I wanted to see for quite a long time. It just recently opened in the Netherlands, and people at work, friends all started to talk about the film...I came to the movie theater already being prepared for a spectacular show. First part of the film can be a bit boring for some people, but those who are familiar with East-Asian theater traditions, they know that the action will not make you waiting for long time.. The plot seems to be too complicated at the beginning, but after half hour you suddenly realize that in this movie plot is not so important. Camera work, design, performances are great. At some point you realize that what is going on the screen is a real event in the cinema world. Some people are afraid of movies with subtitles. In Crouching tiger... I did not really notice them, so natural is the way the director tells us the story.. Martial scenes are beautifully shot. Some compare this movie with The Matrix. But Crouching tiger.. has so much more depth. The real culmination of the movie is already well-known fight on the tops of the trees. If you never had a feeling of flight, at this movie you will feel it. Ang Lee is a magician. The way he tells us the story of his characters has an effect of a magic spell: everyone who leaves the theater want to see the movie again. The film is so multi-leveled so you can hardly understand it at once. Return to this movie like to a good wine which needs time to be matured. I am sure we are present at the birth of the new movie-classics. In couple words: Don't waste your time and just go find this movie in your theater.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

But it is not a masterpiece.The problem is the story. There's way too much exposition at the start, we're led in by one character, then lose focus on her and go to another, send lost of time in the desert, but never really get to the bottom of why our young heroine is like she is.Before you leap to your keyboard, I'm not the kind of movie goer that needs everything spelt out, but for all its visual magnificence (and it is wonderful), at the end I still felt hungry.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It was not supposed to be THAT funny...,"Watching this film was a delight, but I could not watch it in the cinema without being slightly irritated by the other people laughing. It was supposed to be a drama, but some people laughed so much I was starting to think that they were misinformed about it's thematic content. The scenes with the martial art, with the characters flying through the air (gracefully, I might add) during duals, seem to provoke the most laughter. I just hope those people didn't think this was some kind of spoof on the Hong Kong martial art films.Crouching Tiger was a film that many lovers of Martial art films have been thinking about. However, until now, there has not really been a director capable enough, with sensitive enough control of acting and story, to truly capture the myth and magic of martial art. But Ang Lee is a director who understands both the western and eastern culture, and he knew exactly how to allow the westerners appreciate what he must have loved as a child.But I just wish it had been a more general release so I could have watched in a quite empty cinema, on my on, on a Tuesday afternoon, instead of in a packed cinema on a Friday night with people who thought it was 'kickass martial art film'.

Meaning,"The true meaning of this movie, I think (I haven't seen anyone post the same) is the battle between the ethical(Li mu Bai) and the aesthetic (the young girl who follows her heart) (Yes Kierkegard)This clash is one that everyone must go threw either unconsciously(don't do anything and just live the life the way you do) or consciously (re-affirming your will to power). And that doing things the right way all the time can lead to regret(the worst of all pains), but one who follows their heart regardless of right or wrong has no place in society. It is the great tear of the individual subconscious in society then or now. Live the way we tell you and die slowly(you are a slave if you chose that, whether you want to admit it or not..Read Nietzche) or live the way you want to and die quickly; the only true freedom....On a diffirent note the directing in this movie was absolutely amazing, the scene where they were sword fighting in the trees, then did a slow shot on the girl laying back on the willow falling down sent chills down my back, absolutely amazing...Bar none some of the best directing I've ever seen",,Anonymous,Fantasy

I think there is an urge to reallywant to go with the crowd and join the praise. It feels good to bandtogether and unanimously cheer something.  When ""Unbreakable""came out there was a deafening silence about that movie. Nobodyknew what to think of it! Then someone said.....""this movie sucks!""and like a pin to a balloon the condemnation slapped that moviesilly and it disappeared from theatres, and from Oscar hopes.Now with the universal praise of CTHD almost as deafening, Ihave to raise my little hand up in the air and speak my little piece oftruth which is.....what the he!! are these critics talking about? Goodmovie? yes. Great movie? no. Disappointing movie? YES. (herecomes the tirade) I was extremely disappointed with this movie!Ang Lee is one of my favorite directors and this movie just totallylacks drama, man! It's like, kind of boring. I don't understand themotivations of any of the characters and the pacing is dull, the fightscenes come out of nowhere and don't resolve anything! They'recool to watch but they don't really move the story, the drama, andthe action forward. I hate that! And from Ang Lee too! Whomastered drama with 'The Ice Storm', subtle comedy with 'Senseand Sensibility', human frailty and realism with 'The WeddingBanquet', and building suspense with 'Ride With the Devil'. All ofthose movies do something better than this one. I just wasn'tmoved at all. Perhaps it would communicate more meaning to aChinese audience..(well, those subtitles were kind of distracting)..Idon't know. I just wished it were better. Or maybe it's just that I wasweaned on the overpowering Spielberg/John Williams ""we aregoing to MAKE you cry, laugh, squirm, etc.."" formula and can'taccept something subtler and finer. I'll still probably buy it on DVDso I can watch it without the annoying subtitles! My reaction to thismovie reminds me of my reaction to 'Princess Mononoke'. Amidstdeafening applause I sat there silently and asked, am I just adum-dum? did I miss something? did that movie make anydamned sense at all? Anyway , end of tirade.

overrated movie,"I'm gonna stick my neck out and write that this movie is overrated. It's good, sometimes very, very good, the fightscenes are fenomenal and the photography is stunning, but it's not a fantastic movie. Maybe if you haven't seen to many movies, or to many movies of this kind, then you could think it's the best movie in the world. I have seen to many films in my life to be shrugged at when i cast my opinion about this movie, but that is what happens. If you say you think this movie was just okay, then the fans look at you in a strange way and you can almost see in they're eyes this guy must have bad taste in movies or he doesn't know what he talks about. Well, Ang Lee's martial arts- western lack a story to begin with, it's a saga, nothing more and to implicate anything philosophical into the movie is quite silly.Between the killer fightscenes it's almost boring, very beautiful, very well acted, but you kind of wait for the next fightscene to come along. After a while, as in any movie,you begin to feel tiresome with the flying combats and when they fly down the waterfall it's Superman- the movie. If they can fly, why do the fight at all? And as i friend of mine pointed out, why is it suddenly so okay with women fighting, why are all going, oohh it's so feminist, it's so awesome, so cool and so forth. But they're fighting nonetheless and it's that a good thing? I know i'm out of line here a bit because it's a fairytale, but a lot of things bothered me.Like the roller coaster ride of different genres within the movie. it's a adventure movie, a action movie, a period piece, a romance, a western and a martial arts movie all wrapped up in one, and that brings the movie down. It's to much up and down, it can't decide what kind of movie it will be. So there you have it.

SilverRating,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Wo Hu Cang Long)- Taiwan 2000 ReviewThis is film #2 on the film list. This movie was awesome. I hate referencing and comparing movies but this movie was what I thought of as a Matrix meets Western in Asia. The film is stunningly visual with the concepts as well as amazingly realist with the fights. If you didn't pay attention, you might have thought this be a true story of a magic sword, the story telling is that good. But once you saw people fly off rooftops or fight on a thin bamboo tree you might think differently.This movie, from a Directing standpoint was amazing. I can only applaud Ang Lee, how does he do it. This had his fingerprints all over it too. The fight scenes had the most dramatic and beautifully capturing and captivating camera angles, but then when the movie slowed and came to a emotional or less serious scene, it was stunning his way of capturing emotion. His directing in this type of movie=second to none.Much of the story and concept confused me until clarification.

If you just ""Don't get it"" or ""I hate subtitles in a movie"" you should just go back and read the Sunday comics and watch Bugs Bunny cartoons. Perhaps you should read a little more about the world that exists out there and then watch CTHD again. Anyway, CTHD is a great film. Do go see it and form your own opinion on it.

Understand what you critique,"First off, I like to say that as an Asian-American, I have seen this kind of movie from my dad who is into the Wuxia genre. However, this is not to say that this movie was not one of the best this year (2000). For those people who do not really understand certain elements of this film (i.e. ""the flying/floating"") understand that it is no different than from Western heroes flying (i.e. Superman, etc."") Take the movie for what it is, a fable and a fairy tale. Even Ang Lee said that it was a movie about ""a China that never existed except in my boyhood fantasies and stories."" Anyone who complains about the flying and floating is not be fair and informed. CTHD is one of the best movies this year purely based on the acting alone. I understand Cantonese and to some extent Mandarin. I watched the actors and actresses and I was amazed at the gestures and expressions all the characters had. Please, go watch it one more time for those who had seen it already and this time pay attention to this aspect of the film. The eyes! My God! What suppressed emotions are there! What does Gladiator have over this movie? Nothing! And I LOVED Gladiator! Anyway, I agree with some that the desert scene was a little too long but this does not detract from the movie and to an extent, was necessary. I have read many reviews from the movie going audience out there and I believe we all have a right to voice our opinions but please don't trash a movie because you had to read subtitles! My friend who is American went and saw the film with me enjoyed it just as much and he read the entire movie.

Glorious and Haunting,"Dear Dream Journal,I remember going to see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon on December 8th of last year... well before all of this Oscar attention and bandwagon jumping hoopla. Having heard very little about the movie, aside from the fact that it was directed by Ang Lee and that it had created quite a bit of a stir at Cannes and the Toronto International Film Festival, I was open-minded; apparently, it was also touted as a Westernized take on a very Eastern genre - Wuxia.  Having grown up while weaned on tonnes of this type of film (mystical flying, melodramatic storylines, and dance-like martial arts in general,) I thought I had seen it all.I attended the opening night screening with my best friend, and about half an hour into the film (about the the time the first fight/chase scene occurred) it dawned upon both of us that we were in the midst of watching one of those very special films that only come around once in a very long time. The movie's vision prompted uncontrollable giddy excitement and knots in my stomach; the characters were literally flying around, skimming across rooftops and treating the laws of gravity as if they were only a suggestion. I felt like I was being led by a master magician whose trick I knew couldn't possibly be real -- but I let myself believe it anyways.  There was a kinetic energy to the first fight scene, one which left me gasping for breath as Michelle Yeoh's character repeatedly tugged on Zhang Yiyi to keep her from becoming airborne.  The drumbeat in the soundtrack, editing, and flurry of moves came at a metronomic pace, until it culminated into an eruption of audience applause at the end.  It turns out that the movie was just giving us a taste of things to come.  The fight scenes build, and of special note is the intense battle in the weapons room, and also, of course, the unforgettable scene atop the bamboo grove that possessed such magic, such gorgeous lyricism that it still haunts me to this day.  I think these three scenes can be considered as some of the best action sequences to be ever captured on celluloid.  Yes, I've seen good martial arts movies.  Jet Li's ""Fist of Legend,"" comes to mind, but what that movie had in sheer physical prowess, it lacks in execution and presentation.  Yes, I've seen good wuxia movies featuring zero-gravity.  Tsui Hark's ""A Chinese Ghost Story,"" and ""Bride With White Hair"" are notable examples, but the technique is never used as audaciously or breathlessly as it is in Crouching Tiger.I know I've talked a lot about the the martial arts in this movie, but before I fall into the trap of labelling this as a kung fu movie, let me be certain to say that Crouching Tiger is a fantasy film first and foremost, that also happens to contain refreshingly complex romantic subplots and fantastic martial arts.  The movie is not revolutionary in any isolated category, but it is one of the best examples of a movie reaching the apotheosis of refinement in its genre.  The trappings are there -- the battle of good vs. evil, the melodramatic quadruple love arc, the requisite restaurant fight scene, a legendary sword, unnecessary characters -- but the brilliance of the movie is in the details.Notice the exquisite direction of Ang Lee; this is film that is beautifully shot, beautifully acted, beautifully executed.  Notice the lush cinematography of a China that can barely be contained within the confines of the frame; notice the care that went into the costumes; notice the soundtrack and how pants and drums and moody cellos accentuate the action; notice the unusual way that the fight sequences are shot (overhead views, large numbers of moves before an edit, an unflinching camera during long, stunningly choreographed sequences); notice the care that went into supplying everyone in the restaurant fight scene with different weapons, all strange and unique looking; notice the amount of restraint shown by the protagonists.  These features are not there by accident, but rather because are part of the director's vision that he wanted to project.And what a glorious vision it is!  I walked away from the movie stunned, knowing that I had seen one of the best movies... ever.  It is unfortunate that the film has come attached with the stigma of a foreign film being released in a year full of ""weak"" films. As such, some might view it as overrated, or the obligatory slice of ""culture"" for the year. I think anyone who appreciates film can see that Crouching Tiger can hold its own in any year of release -- it has that timeless, ethereal element to it.  When I left the theatre, it was akin to waking from a dream... I could only remember bits and pieces of it --the drums, the panoramic views of China, swirling ribbon over a wall, the tension in Michelle Yeoh's face, feet skimming over water, and then scurrying up a supple bamboo branch... It was as if my imaginative mind were a glass of water and these fragments, droplets of food colouring.  The droplets may be small when compared with the water in the cup, but  they have forever imbued the way the way I view film again.Indeed, it was like a dream... and I had to write it down.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Yea I understand its good.,The acting is probably the stand out part of this film. You can see in all the actors faces they they love there job and they know how to do there job well. You can see why many of the actors in this film whent on to do so well.They are masters of there craft.The fight scenes where amazingly put together and thought out incredibly wellI think the second biggest part of this film i loved the most was the camera work.All of the shots in this film were amazing the dramatic close up to the action packed wide angles that let you see so much more then what is going on. Most of the time the actors feel like ants with how much of the amazingly looking backgrounds there are.The story is where this film lets me down a little slow and a little boring for me I didn't feel like it was well put together and the dramatic parts didn't feel like they had the effect they needed. Its like going to the top of a roller coaster and then coming down at the same speed you went up at. I just felt like it didn't hit me like a good love story should.Yes watch this film its very good and very impressive and a lot of people in front and behind the camera put in a lot of hard work and it shows. But would I watch it again probably not.,8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The star that shines on the world of martial arts movies,"I am among one of the first to see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon for its premiere in New York.  I have to say that I am guilty of being an crazy man about this movie.  I saw this movie three time, (still countin') twice in Taiwan and once in the US.  This is one of the movies that you appreciate more when you watch it for the second time, third time, and on...My roommate, who I dragged to see this movie, loved it, and said it was incredible, definite one of the best movie he's seem all year.  And I have to say that, it has just the right combination of action and drama, that one craves the other.Maybe you will say ""well, he's Chinese, so what if he likes the film, he's supposed to, right?""To that, I can only say ""Actually, that's more the reason for me to suppose to dislike the film.""If you have not heard from people in Taiwan or China, a lot of Chinese didn't like this movie, because Chow Y. Fat and Michelle Yeoh did not speak ""perfect"" mandarin that their character demands.  Michelle is from Mala., so her Chinese is as good as a foreigner speaking mardarin, and CYF is not a good speaker since he speaks Cantonese.  Most of my Chinese friends were so into the imperfect Chinese that they miss the content of the movie.So you see, the fact that I am Chinese and likes the movie is rather a guarantee that the movie will be worth a look.I cannot see how anyone can dislike the movie--you see ""The 10 commandments"" but even if you are not Christian/Jewish, will you be like: ""The story sux... how can a burning bush talk?""  If you see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and be like ""Puff, kung-fu is just a hoax...""  then you better see the movie again, because chances are, you either have no imagination what so ever (which, I recommend you get some or you'll be a very boring person to be around) or you kinda just let the big picture slip by you when we were so caught up in the petty details.This movie is beautiful, artistic, and full of deep life lessons--Only if you look for them.  Don't just waiting for the director to throw them at your face--""Pow!  there's a lesson to u!""  Its everything you thought about action movies--except that it is so much more.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"visually stunning, beautifully directed but a little messy","This movie is really a must-see, because of Ang Lee's impressive direction, the marvelous performance by Chow Yun Fat (as usual), and the incredibly choregraphed fight scenes. Yet, I wouldn't rate this movie as one of my all time favourite because of the plot which is too messy; I felt a little lost during the (very) long intermission of the stolen comb, and some scenes, while creating some of the atmosphere and introducing the characters, were a little too long. Translation hurts this movie for sure, even if it was a perfect one; I speak japanese well enough to follow movies in japanese, and many times when I read subtitles I feel the impossibility to translate idiomatic expressions; I had this impression many times during Wo hu cang long (though I don't speak chinese). Unfortunately, you can't fully appreciate this kind of culture-empowered movies without knowing and mastering the culture. Anyway, it's a must-see. 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great Martial Arts Film.  Great movie?  Well...,"After a year of disappointing movies (witness the mediocre GLADIATOR and ERIN BROCKOVITCH), I was hoping to see a Best Picture nominee which I could endorse.  Alas, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON is NOT it. How can one enthusiastically endorse a movie whose opening scene is sofuzzy, whose dialogue track is so hollow, which has several key scenes which are so choppily edited, whose story is so convoluted, whose ending is so nihilistic and with those stupid ""flying"" sequences, in many of which the harnesses are clearly visible.HOWEVER, I can state without a doubt, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON contains the greatest fighting sequences AND one of the finest film performances I have yet witnessed.  That BOTH these can be attributed to one performer, Ziyi Zhang, is absolutely remarkable.To explain almost any of the story would ruin the fun, so I won't. The film summary does that quite perfectly, thank you. Interestly women totally dominate this movie.  All of the fight sequences occur EITHER between a man and a woman, two women or one woman and several men.  In almost all instances, the woman wins.  When that woman is Ziyi Zhang, one can well believe she would.  NOBODY I've ever seen is faster.By all means, see CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, particularly if you enjoy great martial arts.  Just don't expect too much.  This movie is WAY too overpraised.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A breath of fresh air,"Crouching Tiger. is the latest film from director Ang Lee  (Sense and Sensibility, Ride with the Devil).  This is yet another example of the diversity of this talented director, who is surely as open minded as the Coen brothers when it comes to their scope for possibilities in film.Presented in its original Mandarin language, with English subtitles, this film presents a bold statement for how much more open-minded cinemagoers are becoming.  It's a pleasure to see so many people going to see this; purely justification for the risks Lee took.The film is set in early 19th century China, which is presented here in all its mystical and mythical glory, including a fantastic image of the splendours of Beijing (here presented as Peking as befits the time period). Chow Yun-fat plays Li Mu Bai, an expert swordsman and master of the martial art style of Wudan.  He has long spent time in meditative reflection, but has come to realise that something, or someone has been missing from his life.  That someone is Yu Shu Lien (played here with enormous dignity by Michelle Yeoh).  He returns to her to tell her that he is giving up his sword, the Green Destiny, a mysterious jade sword four hundred years old. He entrusts her to take it with her to give to an old friend in Peking. While in Peking, the sword is stolen by a thief in the middle of the night.You realise at this stage in the film that it has been moving at a relatively slow pace, because suddenly it bursts into action, with a tremendous chase across the rooftops, and (literally) up the walls of Peking.  I've no wish to reveal much more of the film, as it's best left to discover its hidden secrets for yourself, and behold the wonders of a master director at work.The performances by all involved are superb, Chow Yun-fat's Li, has a calm well being to his character, with a burning inner desire.  Yeoh's Yu, has a spark of danger to her character, while being protective of Li and the Wudan ways.  However, best of all is the performance by 21-year old Ziyi Zhang, as the evocative Governor's daughter Jen Yu.  She has a gentle beauty, which disguises her internal rage, where she is split between two destinies - which will she choose?The film is presented straight-faced, which I found refreshing, with little seeds of humour planted sparingly throughout the film.  China has never looked better on film, with its lush mountain environments coming to the fore, and presenting an unspoken character within which all the legends are based.  The music also presents an emotional quality often missing from films these days, mixing a sophisticated Western orchestration, with the fragile melodies of traditional China.The film mixes strong characterisation and narrative with explosive scenes of breath-taking and at times jaw-dropping action.    If there are similarities to the action in the Wachowski brother's seminal SF movie The Matrix, this is because the same choreographer was used in both films, although to a much greater and expansive use in Crouching Tiger.This film deserves to be seen by as many as possible - hopefully by people who can be open minded to watch a film which operates on at least two levels, rather than your standard action fare.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The kids are (maybe) alright,"Gorgeously shot, well-acted battle over the soul of a talented, aristocratic young martial artist, Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi). Her petulance is matched by her martial arts gifts which have been honed at the foot of the evil Jade Fox (Pei-Pei Cheng). Jen's petulance and her abilities create all sorts of complications which Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) solve with magnanimity and grace. The masters have dedicated their lives to mastery of their chosen art and Jen tests their every ounce of skill and patience.The direction is calm and assured and the look of the film is glorious. The fight scenes are otherworldly and the acting, from all major players is excellent. Beneath the surface of the story are hardly kept-in-check passions and the acting, from the leads to Cheng Chang as Dark Cloud, Pei Pei Cheng as Jade Fox, and Sihung Lung as local respected elder Sir Te captures the controlled passions well.The story of a girl whose talents warrant a lot of patience is gorgeous, melancholy, and well- done by everyone involved.

Not for the mainstream American,"Watching CTHD for the 2nd time last night, found myself enjoying and liking the film even better than I did the first time.  1st time was on VHS, this time on DVD, which allowed me to cheat and watch it with the English dubbing, and not do the subtitles, allowing me to better concentrate on the movie without having to read the dialogue.  Being able to do so, got to appreciate the film even more. I have read a lot of harsh criticism on the messaging board for this movie, and really do not understand it.  I can understand one personally not finding the movie their cup of tea, but to be so bad mouthing of a film that did not warrant it in any way shape or form... people who just don't get it, and most likely frequent and see movies like Deuce Bigelow, or Real Spring Break Cancun, or, whatever that flick that was that had the American idol winners in it... for future reference, all of you keep your ignorance to yourself. The 1st time I saw CTHD, I didn't know what it was going into it, and have never really watched any 'martial arts' films before... remember the gravity-defying sequences as a detraction to me, it's unrealism - sometimes I am too highly realistic.   This time around, letting myself go, allowing myself to be taken in by the Wudan trained ability of being able to free themselves of the physical boundaries that bind us, was able to be entertained by the grace, beauty and magic of it. The movie itself is a very beautiful movie, both cinematically, obviously - beautifully shot, the sequence in the trees is just a visionary, beautiful, etheral dream that is unequalled.  And the story is quite good, since I have at least, a minimal understanding and Eastern culture and philosophy, really a beautiful story of love, freedom, tradition, heritage, culture, passion, and the living spirit.  I certainly recommend it to those who are, intelligent, learned, broad and open minded, and true cinema movie go'ers out there.To those who bad mouthed it the way they did, isn't there some reality television show on right now for you to go watch?!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Haunting, surreal martial arts fantasy","Like most Westerners I had always associated martial arts films with the standard Bruce Lee action vehicles or the humorous Jackie Chan equivalents. My wife, however, who is herself Chinese, tells me that in the Far East there is a tradition of using martial arts elements in many different cinematic genres, including historical romances. 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a rare example of a film of this type to have achieved success in the West. Set in Imperial china, it tells the story of two warriors, Li Mu Bai (male) and Yu Shu Lien (female) and their attempts to recover a valuable sword which has been stolen by a young girl named Jen Yu. Jen is the daughter of a wealthy aristocratic family, and outwardly a respectable young lady, but she is secretly in revolt against her background and the limited possibilities open to her, and has secretly been receiving martial arts training from a notorious outlaw named Jade Fox. (Also a woman; strong female characters are a tradition in martial arts films).Intertwined with the action sequences are two love stories; one between Jen and her bandit lover Lo, the other between Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien, who are obliged to hide their feelings for one another by the austere warrior code to which they subscribe. I found that the romance between Jen and the desert nomad Lo was never quite convincing; it seemed like the East Asian equivalent of those old Hollywood desert epics where the heroine ends up falling in love with the sheikh who has kidnapped and ravished her. The love between Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien, however, although at times it is so repressed as to be virtually invisible, does lead to the most poignant and tragic scene in the film when they realize their feelings for each other when it is too late.Although I could never believe in her love for Lo, the character of Jen is an interesting and ambiguous one. At one level she is an arrogant and spoilt brat, whose mischief-making leads to pain and suffering for others. At another level, however, I found myself sympathising with her and her impatience with her stifling conformist background where she is expected to be dutiful and obedient and to achieve nothing in life other than to marry the boy of her parents' choice. Her theft of the sword can be seen both as wanton disobedience and as a necessary act of justified rebellion. The lovely Zhang Ziyi, who seems set to succeed the luminously beautiful Gong Li as the queen of Chinese cinema, did well to suggest both sides of her character. Of the other characters, Michelle Yeoh as Yu Shu Lien was probably the best; Chow Yun-Fat as Li Mu Bai seemed rather too stolid.What really made the film stand out, however, was its visual beauty. This may seem a strange quality to praise in a martial arts film, but the fight scenes were the most beautiful of all, particularly those between Yu Shu Lien and Jen. I should point out that this is in no sense a realistic film. The characters have powers that verge on the supernatural (although in the context of the film this is attributed to their rigorous martial arts training). They are able to run up vertical walls, float through the trees, bound effortlessly across the rooftops and leap high into the air and hover there. This is achieved not by computer-generated effects but by stunt work on wires, often performed by the stars themselves rather than by stunt doubles. The result is a strange, breathtaking aerial ballet of an exquisite beauty which contributes to making this a haunting, surrealist film. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beauty and sometimes spectacular but without plot,"The mostly favorable reviews I got for this film (not only written ones but also comments from friends) convinced me to go to the cinema to check it myself. I must admit that I was unable to find some of the supposed merits of ""Crouching.."". The plot is ridiculous (if there is plot at all), the characters are flat and many of the acting sequences are too obviously a fake (I don´t say that just for the ""flying"" but if you do something do it right). I´m not saying that this is an awful film. In fact it is maybe one of the best films in the last months as far as I can judge. But, being serious, it is highly overrated.Where do I find the real strong points of this film? Well, I was really shocked by some scenes. The mix of a perfect photography, magic sets and really beauty shots create a handful of great moments (I remember specially a close-up to Jen and Lo with a waterfall as background and the arriving at Beijing). Of course there are some fight scenes that are spectacular (after all the film is nothing more than a discontinuous fight scene). Finally, the music is quite interesting when no consisting exclusively in drum beats. In these aspects ""Crouching.."" has many things to teach to action-filmmakers.And now the comparisons. I would never believe that I was going to say that ""Matrix"" had a prodigy of plot but after ""Crouching.."" I must reelaborate the standards for kung-fu flicks. We must praise the effort for trying to tell a story to link the fights (breaking the model of ""Bloodsport"") but sadly it has been only a try (the dialogs are hilarious in their pretended deepness and all the characters have only one idea in mind and don´t change it for almost any reason). Maybe the problem rely on the fact that the screenplay adapts one of the books of a series of five (I´m not sure of that point but, in any case, is one of the novels in the middle). It is like a bridge in the middle of a river with no beginning nor end. I can accept the lack of one of the extremes but both of them is too much for me.On overall, and considering the rest of films of the year, I will give it a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Huh?,"...I don't know - I'm not much of a martial arts film connoisseur, so maybe I just can't appreciate the film's merits.  For anyone who cares, however, I'll tell you what I saw.  I saw a rushed storyline, littered with overly elaborate flashbacks that spread the plot far too thinly, leaving me wondering who it was I was supposed to be caring about.  Li Mu Bai?  Why should I care about him?  Okay, he's a great warrior, he's retiring, and he supposedly has this long history with Yu Shu Lien.  None of this is bringing tears to my eyes, but hey...maybe the movie's really about Jen Yu, the renegade daughter of the Governer.  Hmm...she's a brat, she's hard to like, and the only history of her I'm given is a flashback that takes up a quarter of the movie just so I can see how she met Lo?  All of the passion in this movie is extraordinarily superficial.  I never once got the impression that Li Mu Bai really *loved* Yu Shu Lien, and I'm sorry...Jen's love for Lo wasn't demonstrated well enough for me to understand her suicide.  Like I said, perhaps I can't appreciate why this film is supposed to be good.  It seems like a lot of ""I love you, I hate you.  Let's fight to the death."" The fight scenes were exhilarating at times, but the use of wires was way, WAY over the top.  Where I was expecting superhuman leaping ability, I received out-and-out *flight*.  It was much easier to accept in The Matrix where it was (a) the future, and (b) NOT REAL.  Nothing in this movie suggested to me that we were dealing with a fantasy land, so I was left wondering why Yun-Fat Chow was doing his best Mary Martin impression.  To put it bluntly, the script was shallow and predictable, and the fight scenes were exciting and well choreographed one minute, then completely overblown and down-right *silly* the next.  The acting was decent and so was the casting, but neither of the latter two are enough to make this a good film - CERTAINLY not the 27th best of all time on IMDb's list.  I think we're going to see that there because this film hasn't been exposed to a mass audience. People who love martial arts flicks are going to cream themselves over this one, just as people who like teen dramedies confess time and time again that Empire Records is the greatest film ever made.

A storytelling worth many viewings and interpretations,"I went because some local review ran something like, ""Fast kickin', high jumpin', and good actin'!""Certainly all of that was true, but there was also a lyricism and magic about this film that was totally unexpected and totally overwhelming.  It's James Bond and Raiders of the Lost Ark woven into a mythical and rich story to be told in beautiful images.  The story itself obviously left lots of room for personal interpretation (the person I saw it with disagreed on some major points), and all of that is to say nothing of the value of the resonances in other myths and, I'm sure, other Chinese literature.A ""must see again and again"", I can wholeheartedly recommend this film.  I rank it up there with the most truly invigorating stories I've ever heard.P.S. I'd also bet it was made on less than $10 MM.

Characters soar and even fight with a grace that is very balletic in nature. I didn't find this movie boring at all, but very engrossing. I love movies that take me to ""another place"" and that's exactly what this did. The fight between Zhang Ziyi and Michelle Yeoh was amazing, the bamboo forest scene was hypnotic, and the score was haunting; I can't say enough.

It completely ruined the ""Suspension of Disbelief"" that is needed in a good movie.  Every time I saw some actor ""flying"", it just reminded me this is just a kung-fu flick.  In a movie like the Matrix, it worked well because they setup an alternate reality in which the laws of gravity didn't comply.  If they had setup a more mythical setting for the film it may have worked.  But as it ended up, the wire work fight scenes seemed to be the basis of the film and plot just advanced you to the next completely outrageous fight.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Archtypically Chinese Drama,"The movie ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a beautifully lyrical tale set in some unspecified ancient period of Chinese history. It details the unsuccessful struggle of a master swordsman to foreswear his profession, and to bring to fruition his personal relationship with the lady security consultant who is the object of his emotional desire.They work together to try to recover his quasi-magical emerald engraved sword, which he has given in trust to his old weapons-training master, but which has been mysteriously stolen by a night-thief...The true identity and historical reasons for this theft provide much of the tension in the second half of the movie.The fanciful aspects of the story where the martial-artists seem to gain an increasing mastery over gravity---sailing from one rooftop to another, cannot be reconciled with Western ""literalness"", but are more fitted to classical arabian or oriental fairy-tales, or even of the Greco-Roman ""deux-ex-machina"" direct-interference of ""Gods"" in the plots of mortal men...If taken as literal storytelling, the movie fails in ""believability"".. but taken as an allegorical, poetic, fanciful parable  it is a wonderful success...This movie is suprisingly well acted---suprisingly by western standards-----the characterization and the plot development owe much more to Buddhist or Zen Koan philosophy, and to the very stylized manners of Japanese (originally Chinese) ""puppet"" theatre. Western viewers who have any background in watching opera will have no trouble with the ""stylized"" aspects of the acting.Like moonlight through waving bamboo, the ending is moody, reflective, ambivalent, philosophical....ultimately enlightening.This is far better storytelling and possibly better martial-arts than anything Bruce Lee ever managed to bring to the screen during HIS lifetime... The music score is alternately lush and exotic, with cello solos by Yo-Yo Mah giving it just the right touch of ""classical"" western melody. The cinematography is equal to anything from the epic films of David Lean.I can't wait to go see it again!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Call me Stupid American,"Beautifully shot, beautifully acted, beautifully choreographed, beautifully scored.  I just can't get past the fact that people fly in this movie- just float away in the middle of an otherwise breathtaking fight scene.  My wife chalked it up to a ""cultural difference"" that I couldn't possibly understand.  Perhaps.  Is there some Chinese legend I don't know about that says true martial arts masters can fly?  Bending the laws of gravity is one thing.  But when a character raises one fist and lifts off the ground a la Superman, my suspension of disbelief stops there.  I could have seen my way past it if it had even been explained within the context of the plot.  But it's just put up there, and we're meant to take it on faith that for whatever reason, these people can fly.  The flying didn't even seem to serve a true purpose, except to make the film even more ""visually stimulating.""  I thought the fight scenes were so good, the flying was an unnecessary effect that tainted my view of the rest of the movie.

Was this movie really as great as the reviews it received?,"I saw this movie for no other reason then it received unbelievable reviews, and I heard such amazing things. So I must concede that this type of movie isn't one would normally watch. But after going I couldn't believe it got the reviews it did. Was it a very good movie, yes. Did it have a good story, and was it very well acted, again yes. But was it Great NO. I was bored for much of it, and I thought on a whole that it was rather stupid (people flying through the air to fight, even with its symbolic meaning). Also I was particularly annoyed at the critically acclaimed cinematography. I was dizzy for half the movie. I thought the shots were extremely close all the time, and it was very difficult to follow, especially the fight scenes. It may have given a faster and more real effect but at the confusion I felt as a result, wasn't worth the realism.  Over all it was a good movie but was it an 8.9 on average, and number 9 of all time. In my opinion definitely not. I implore you users to think for yourselves and not to just think it is great because critics say so.For all of you who did think it was a great movie I will see this movie again when it comes on video because of the reviews it continues to get, and maybe my opinion will change if I missed something the first time.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
whoa man,"this is one of the best movies I've seen-EVER. sure it may be in subtitles, but some of the best movies are. The dialog, story, and action scenes, are all very good, and I can't wait to see it again. There's no doubt that this is a winner",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Best movie I've seen this year,"I can't imagine who wouldn't like this movie -- it's got awesome characters and plotting, an engaging setting, and Yuen Wo-ping's most spectacular fight choreography yet.

Robbed at the Oscars getting its just rewards on IMDb!,"Master Li Mu Bai is a lawman, traveller, soldier who fights evil, battles Injustice and does general daring deeds. He returns to the city and meets Shu Lien, his dead brother's wife who has long since been in love with. However, he returns with good news, he is hanging up his sword, the Green Destiny, up for good and seeking out the supposed simple life. However, in this tragic, action drama, nothing is simple as the sword is stolen by a mysterious warrior.As Li Mu Bai's nemesis the Jade Fox returns Li Mu Bai knows that he will have to face his nemesis one last time if he is to succeed in attaining the life he yearns for without bloodshed, knowing that all of his efforts where not in vain. However, as Jen Yu, a young woman about to enter into an arranged marriage, is entering a period of emotional instability, it means that every character in this immense film is in more danger than they realise. In Ang Lee's colossal film these themes take on the power of Gods as every hidden emotion, every glance, every movement and every gesture takes on further meaning.The direction is amazing and the entire film is beautiful to behold, and having sen it at the pictures three times, believe me, I know. The costumes, the cinematography and props are fantastic and every craftsman who spent time on this film deserves an award for their efforts. The acting is first rate with all three leads being unbelievably awesome. usually at this stage I feel the need to single someone out, but I can't! They're all excellent and it makes for a film that is impossible to tear your eyes away from.That said it does take a few scenes to get used to the whole wire work stuff in there and I remember when I first saw it I thought ""What the hell is this?"" But by the time I was half way in, I didn't care.The fight scenes of course are the things that give the film its action heart and they are incredible, with a number of multi-character fights that must have been tortuous to put together, but the best one being the one with the two women with the variety of weaponry that is so gripping and so violent as they really seem to go at t with hatred and vengeance so strong that they really seem to want to kill each other. This is no ""Charlie's Angels"" bullsh*t fighting, this is the real deal.It was annoying at the time that the film was beaten at the Oscars to the best picture and Best Director nods by Gladiator and Traffic as both of these films, for me, have faded, while the things that make this film great, still make it great now, but I guess that's due to the fickle nature of the academy voters. However, it is pleasing that it's in the top 250, but sad that it's so far down.Sumptuous and Sublime!Em",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Lee's Movie Takes Flight (And So Do Its Actors),"Versatile director Ang Lee (""The Ice Storm,"" ""Sense and Sensibility,"" ""Brokeback Mountain"") made a certain type of Chinese martial arts film a crossover hit with ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" and it's only because of this film that later similar movies, like ""Hero,"" ""House of Flying Daggers"" and ""Curse of the Golden Flower"" received even the attention they did in America.""Tiger/Dragon"" is the kind of movie that feels more profound than it actually is, because all of the lines are delivered in a foreign language and with stoic import. But the plot and ideas are really just typical kung fu movie melodrama -- and that's not a criticism. The movie takes flight, as any good martial arts movie does, when it's fighting, and the combatants literally take to the air, defying the laws of gravity to chase each other through roof and tree tops.And it certainly doesn't hurt that we get the twin eye candy of Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang.""Tiger/Dragon"" became only the third film (""Z"" and ""Life Is Beautiful"" being the others) to be nominated for both Best Picture and Best Foreign Language Film Oscars in the same year. In all three cases, each went on to win the latter award.Grade: A",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Fantastic Film of 2000, But Not The Film of 2000","I saw this movie last night and I must say, this was an excellent movie. It wasn't one of those movies that was all special effects and no story. I was really pleased. However, I don't think it was the best film of the year.The story begins where Chow Yun Fat (some of the movie names are hard to remember) is telling Michelle Yeoh how he's giving the Green Destiny (a really nifty sword that's extremely powerful) to Sir Te, who lives in Peking. So Michelle takes it to Sir Te and meets Governor Yu's daughter, Jen, who is about to marry by arrangement, not by choice, which she's not too happy about. But then the Green Destiny is stolen by one of Jade Fox's (she's a criminal that a lot of people are after) assistants, and now Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh are trying to get it back while also dealing with Jen and her rebellious ways.The story was good, and so was the dialogue. But it's not worthy of any screenplay awards or anything. It wasn't really good at keying with you like the dialogue in films like ""Traffic"" or other emotional tappers.The acting was great. Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yeoh, and the players of Jen, Sir Te, and Jade Fox all gave great performances. My personal favorite was Lo, Jen's secret lover. While he didn't have the biggest role, he added some comic relief to the movie and the actor who portrayed him gave Lo a sense of charm and politeness behind his somewhat ""rebel"" ways.This was a cinematic beauty. The special effects were breathtaking, the music was wonderful, and the camera placements were well-done. It ranks up there on my list of cinematic greats, along with films like ""Traffic"" and ""Psycho"".This was certainly one of the year's best. But it lacked the ""oomph"" that would qualify this movie for Best Picture. My personal pick for best film is still ""Traffic"". But this film is definitely a close second.9/10, mainly because the beginning was a little slow.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Incredibly beautiful,"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (Wo hu cang long) is simply one of the best films ever made.  The movie lives and breathes power, charm, and imagination.  The movie is like a dream mixed with amazing cinematography and beautiful music.  The movie shows happiness and despair.  It's like a movie that is so unique with amazing actors and beautifully choreographed fight scenes.Chow Yung-Fat is inspector Li Mu Bai who decides to give up his amazing sword (the green destiny) and live the rest of his life peacefully.  Li Mu Bai has been in love with Michele Yeoh's character Yu Shu Lien ever since Yu Shu Lien's husband died.  The twist in this love story is that Li Mu Bai's brother was Yu Shu Lien's husband.  Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien have prevented themselves from falling in love in memory of Li Mu Bai's brother.Then one night Li Mu Bai's green destiny is stolen.  Yu Shu Lien fights with the robber but he escapes.  Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi) is a confused daughter of the governor of Beijing.  In disguise Jen Yu is really the thief who stole the green destiny.  Jen Yu also has a secret love that she has kept from her family and her evil trainer Jade Fox.  Jade Fox is also enemies with Li Mu Bai.  To make things even more confusing Jen Yu and Yu Shu Lien have just become good friends when Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien travel to Beijing.  All these conflicts meet to show love, action, and a beautiful story.The Movie itself also puts females in roles normally played by men.  Yu Shu Lien and Jen Yu are two amazing Kung Fu fighters who defeat all their male foes and battle in an amazing Kung Fu scene that will be remembered in movies for all time.  The movies amazing director Ang Lee and amazing crew pull this story together to make it an amazing tale.  Without all the amazing acting the story could have only been another Kung Fu movie.  The movie was nominated for many Oscars and won the second most awards out of any film nominated.  This is an amazing feet considering the movie is a foreign film in mandarin Chinese.If you could only watch 5 movies in your lifetime I would definetly recommend this one.  It has opened my eyes into Kung Fu movies and has made me enjoy foreign films.  Jen Yu was probably my favorite character and I hope to see her in more movies.  What an achievement!10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
ANG LEE DOES IT AGAIN,"Another Ang Lee triumph, that confirms his position as one of the top 3 contemporary directors. Whilst not quite up to ""Ride The High Country"", this is a stunning beautiful film. The fights are electric, the photography is rich, and we have a good old-fashioned adventure/romance tale. It calls on so many other genres other than just martial arts. Catch a quality film, or if you're sad go see ""Castaway"".",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, but not great!","As a chinese and as a big fan of Chow Yun Fat, I am glad to see that CTHD receives all the praises in US.  But honestly, I do think this film is overrated.The scenery is good.  The storytelling is good, but not really special. The fighting scenes are great but definitely not the finest in the Chinese film history.  If you have seen more HK made martial art films, you won't find the story and fighting scenes too special.About the flying (of course human being can't fly, but it's in a fantasy Chinese Wuxei world), it's a very common style and technique being used in Chinese martial art films.  But Ang Lee just made it seen too easy and it could annoy some people (including Chinese).I simply think Zhang Ziyi's screen time is too long and at the end I just don't care too much about her character.  Ang Lee should have put more screen time on Chow and Yaoh's relationship.Even though I am a fan of Chow Yun Fat, I am not impressed by his performance in this film.  But I do think that he's a very good fit for his role.  I am surprised though by Michele Yaoh's performance.  She showed that she can really act and kick ass at the same time.In overall, I think it's a good film, but definitely not a masterpiece! I give it 8/10.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A thing of beauty is a joy forever...,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the most beautiful film I have ever seen. The artistry of the cinematography, choreography, and the story as a whole have to be seen to be believed. It's rare indeed to see such intense action juxtaposed with quite stunning grace and elegance. Nothing is rushed, nothing is wasted.The plot is mysterious and moving, allowing acting of the highest calibre to shine through. Although the cast is uniformly excellent, special mention must go to Michelle Yeoh for her utterly convincing and tragic performance. Her scenes with Chow Yun-Fat are perfect examples of subtlety and tenderness. Her fight scenes astound with their speed and power.This film transports us to a place where heroes still live for honour and excellence, where elite fighters can defy the laws of physics, and perform acts of aerobatic virtuosity. Colours, textures, and landscapes combine with love, anger and humanity to produce as perfect a piece of cinema as you are ever likely to see.

Almost Triumph...,"As a Taiwanese immigrant to Canada, I got the information about 'Crouching Tiger' as soon as the local Vancouverites did.  Having heard about the hype and critic's acclamation for the film, my initial excitement was simply indescribable.  But after seeing it, I realized it's still way too early for me to call it a masterpiece, yet it's so close.Unlike what most US viewers may think, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a splendid representation of the genre it belongs to - ""Wuxia"".  For the uninitiated, the world of Wuxia is a novel-spawn fantasy medieval China where fighters of all kinds develop their unique skills and disciplines, and they all lead their own life to survive in a world full of 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' such as themselves.  It is a living based on vows, friendships, trusts, and a lot of street-wise.  In Hong Kong and Taiwan, Wuxia has become a phenomenal subculture itself, loved by youths and grown adults, whereas the old and more conventional generation oppose it for its 'unrealistic martial arts and bad influences'.Of course, none of this background stuff can be properly explained in the film.  Many may complain that some of the action sequences (namely, flying) are too fakey, but that's really an accepted thing in Wuxia, with conditions.  And for me, seeing all what I've read in the Wuxia novels jump right onto the big screen, and discovering a beauty - in all the fights, dart throwing and chases - that are so new but yet so deeply familiar, is more than just enjoying special effects alone.  Of course, I'd say the techniques could have been done better... but that's minor issue.The part of me left unhappy after seeing the film is the part looking forward to good story development.  The story itself isn't really bad;  in fact, it's complicated, deep and profound.  Yet most of the talking scenes went as 'boring' as they could possibly be.  Whenever the casts got into a slow, long conversation,(it's slower than average Chinese conversation) I became naturally unsettled.  Ang Lee could have tried to quicken the pace of talks and fly through the simple ideas, so that the grand theme of the film could be more visible, and hopefully stir up the dramatic feeling more easily.On the other hand, some of the scenes switched too unnaturally, and sometimes the plot development itself seems unnatural.  All have reasons, and I can always find reasons for the obviously out-of-her-mind Jen in her past days, but why didn't they just spend some time on the explanations (or at least hints) in the first place?  This is where I think the film really didn't do well enough.Overall, I loved Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, but it's too bad that it still has problems that polarize viewer responses.  I will definitely look forward to Ang Lee's future films and sincerely wish him success...",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Criticism of this Movie just doesn't Stand,"No movie this year comes close to beating this movie.  It deserves best picture.  To all those who did not like this movie, ""what the hell did you like?""  ""Dude, where's my car?""  If you don't like this movie, you don't like movies.To respond to all these people who don't understand the movie, here are the answers:Flying:  It's a FANTASY MOVIE.  The story is fictional and adapted from a fantasy book.  By the way, it should be nominated for best adapted screenplay.  Anyways, the reason they can fly is that they have mastered marital arts so much they can even defy gravity.  If you notice, only 4 characters in the movie can fly.  It's a fairy tale, not real a life true story.Ending:  Jen did not die at the end.  At first I didn't understand it either.  If you see the movie again it's pretty clear that she didn't die. Also, this movie was adapted from the fourth installment of a five book series.  Jen I believe is the main character in the fifth book.  By the way, a prequel and a sequel is in the works.Why couldn't she fly to get the antidote:  Because she almost drowned and then was drugged by Jade Fox and couldn't even lift her sword.  How the heck could she fly?If you critics watch the movie over again you will realize much of the flaws are contrived in your head and don't understand the movie.  There are only minor flaws in this movie just like any great movie.  I hope the same people who criticize this movie did the same for ""the sixth sense"" or ""the matrix"" because by far those movies had the bigger flaws.  Just enjoy the movie for what it is.

"Worth Watching, yet...","Since so many people from Greece are commending about this film, I feel like there is room for one more 'unbiased' (?) opinion of a film that was heralded by some as 'the best martial arts movie ever'. First of all I have to say I'm a big fan of Chinese culture and civilization which to me comes second best only to the ancient Greek one ( lets be realistic ). Modern-day China continues to amaze me with the likes of Zhang Yimou in film-making or Faye Wong in music. So imagine my anticipation when I was about to watch 'Chouching Dragon, Hidden Tiger', especially after having read some of the reviews on this website. Nevertheless, I have to admit I'm not a great fan of martial arts films though I watch the occassional Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan film on TV. To set the record straight this film is definitely NOT one of the best films ever made, neither in martial arts nor in any other genre- nevertheless, it's a film worth watching.The assumed strong aspects of the film ( plot, actors, direction, cinematography, choreography ) are all open to personal tastes. By that I mean that every person I asked who has seen the film gave me a diferent opinion of it, some liked aspects of it that I consider weak( such as the plot ) and others scorned aspects of the film which I liked ( such as, surprisingly enough,the 'flying'effects! ) All things considered, the strong points of this film in my opinion are definitely the choreography and fighting scenes ( almost like an arcade game ) - I nearly came close to believing the hype, that such people could exist- thus the fantasy aspect of it, in all. The leading actors are top-class too, especially Zhang Zi Yi, and, last but not least, the drama. Now the weak points unfortunately have to do with the story itself ( nice but too superfluous, and it can be summed up to the description 'a sword is stolen, retrieved, stolen and retrieved again' - not much for my liking ) and somehow I felt that the naivity of the whole thing does let down the movie ( it gravitated incessantly between realism and exaggeration, the latter maybe because they tried to mimic the occasional American blockbuster, action adventure- hey! snap out of it, China doesn't need that ) Overall, I grieve at how much better this film could be. If you like drama and romance don't miss out Zhang Yimou's 'The Road Home'. 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a worth-watching film, nonetheless, and features great performances overall and an exciting new talent in the person of Zhang Zi Yi. No matter if it shows sometimes the icomprehensible tendency of Chinese art to poise between excellency and absurdity.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Incredible Fighting Sequences...and Little Else,"Let me preface this review by saying that I had heard heaps of praise for this film.  However, after having watched it myself I must say that I'm a bit disappointed.While there is a great deal of emphasis on the martial arts choreography in this film, that seems to be the overriding -and only- leitmotif here- do whatever it takes to start another fight sequence.  The performances were good, but I got up thinking that I missed something.  I didn't.  There just wasn't much there, except for some brilliant fight scenes.  But in and of themselves, fight scenes do not make a movie great.The cinematography was excellent, and perhaps deserving of an Oscar -but the original score was totally forgettable.  Hans Zimmer should have won the Oscar hands-down for his scoring of 'Gladiator'.'Crouching Tiger' was an entertaining movie, reminiscent of all those cheesy Kung Fu Theatre marathons I saw as a kid.  But this movie simply fails to tell an intriguing story.That's only my opinion...I'm sure that plenty of you will disagree.  So be it -to each is own.  It just didn't evoke any emotion in me.Here's a suggestion: if you want to see an absolute masterpiece of Asian filmmaking, go rent 'The Seven Samurai'.  In my opinion, Seven Samurai -Along with Ikiru (both directed by Akira Kurosawa)- are the most beautiful movies ever made.My rating: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A love story in a kung-fu movie's clothing,"So many people have complained about the flying, and unfortunately I have to agree with them. There needs to have been an emotional connection made between the flying and the story.  This emotional connection is called meaning.  To expect us to accept that Wudan fly without creating a context in which they might seems rather careless.The non-flying fight scenes were not filmed well, most of the time only the end of a sequence was actually captured, leaving most of the action out of focus.  I understand that their movements were quick, but were supposed to have been invisible as well?  Maybe that is another talent inherent to the Wudan.The love story between Fat and Yeoh was notably strong, noble, and timeless. In contrast, the love story between the younger characters was unfocused, often long-winded, and relied on steamy bath scenes and skin. By the end of the movie, however, I thoroughly enjoyed Jen's character. She was the center of the desperate passions that swirled throughout this movie, and the passions are what nearly make this a great movie. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Total fake, don't know why it is so popular","Typical Hong Kong and Taiwan type martial arts flicks in which there is no martial arts experts such as members of martial arts sport team, instead, ordinary actors and actresses were employed to fake the martial arts actions by the help of cables and cranes.  Anyone with the basic martial arts knowledge would know that actions were choreographed and such actions would not exist in real life.  If you really want to see some real martial arts action, watch Shao Lin Si (Shaolin Temple) made by China in 1979, with Jet Li.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best foreign film I have ever seen.,"""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a very good film that tells the a mythical tail of ancient China.  I don't know much about this area of history so I can't say how accurate it is.  I can say the story and the plot are presented very well and this keeps you interested.  The affects were first rate and compare well to many US and other Western style films.  This one also presents, as stated before, some the ancient myths and legends of China.  Something I have seen very little of and know little about.  This was a good chance for me to see some this up close.  Most of my life has been looking at ancient Rome, Egypt and the like.  So this was refreshing. It was also the first time a film was made that brought this to the publics attention in this manner.  I don't know if the story is true but this brings about some interest on the subject.I have heard some people complain about the subtitles of the film.  All I have to say is, get over it!  This is a foreign film, they don't have to present everything to us Americans on a silver plater.  We can read, so read the subtitles.  I have also heard some people complain that it is unrealistic for people to flow or fly, almost, through the air.  Well, as I said before, this film presents some of the myths and legends of ancient China and the mystery of what was Wudan.  This is how the movie is presented it holds to its story line.  As a result, some of the feats performed and aided by the special affects are realistic for this film.  I never saw, at anytime, the director stepping out of the bounds of the genre.  The only thing that prevents this film from getting a prefect 10, is the fact that the film does get confusing at times and can be difficult to follow. Otherwise, this is an very good film.  If you can get past the subtitles, this one is for you.  If you don't like to read, don't bother.Overall, a must see (9 out of 10).",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The exception to the genera rule,"Now, I've seen a lot of martial arts movies. From the comedic to the serious, from heavy action to light romantic, I've seen quite a few. Some of us have. And, after watching many martial arts movies, one tends to lower the bar in looking for a meaningful story or statement in the film. After years, that one or two lines about the brother or honor, or some avenging desire becomes good enough, and we call it a meaningful martial arts movie.This is the exception. For those not fans of the genera, rest assured that there is more to this film that the jumping, flying, and kicking. Michele Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat's performances and chemistry are as touching as any I've seen in any film for some time. This is the kung-fu flick that you can take your date to with no shame.As for the jumping, kicking, and fighting: It's top notch. Many  stateside fans of the Wo-ping Yuen's work on ""The Matrix"" don't realize how toned down the choreography was for that movie. This is a good chance to see it in full glory, and it is the best work of his that I have seen, brough more to light by Ang Lee's beautiful vision. But if you've never seen ""Black Mask"" or ""Iron Monkey"", be forewarned: these people fly. The first time you see it, it will look like Peter Pan. But, keep watching, it gets very fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, but not great","I never did understand the hoopla behind this film. Yes, the special effects were great. So were those in the Matrix. Yes, the fighting scenes were amazing. But I prefer the realism of Jackie Chan doing his own stunts any day. As for the subplot...I've heard several different opinions about the true meaning of the movie. But none of them could convince me that this movie actually made any kind of point. It basically seemed to drift from one sequence to another. First we have some story about the sword. Then it's stolen. Then they try to find the thief. Not bad so far. But then they go into all sorts of nonsense about the girl's bandit boyfriend, which is about the time that the movie starts drifting into meaninglessness.Maybe it's just me, but if you're going to make a statement about the negative roles assigned to women in ancient China, then at least be a little more upfront about it. Focus on them more, and do it equally. They had three women playing important roles, but only two of them were given any kind of major character development. Personally, I was waiting for Chow Yun Fat to kick the snot out of that pretentious little brat. Sure, she was cute, but her character actually irritated me to no end. I was actually rooting for Michelle Yeoh.Honestly, give me Operation Condor any day. Sure, it's story is meaningless tripe. But it never claims to be anything more than that, which is my biggest complaint about Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
How many words for beautiful can you use?,"CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (2000) **** Directed by Ang Lee. Starring: Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi, Chang Chen, Cheng Pei-pei.I don't have reason to hide that I was worried about what I would think of CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON. I was never a fan of martial-arts movies. The story, the characters and the situations are laughable and, even recognizing that Bruce Lee was a great personality, I just don't care about his movies. It never occurred to me that I could watch a Jackie Chan flick some day, but I thought the fight sequences in THE MATRIX and CHARLIE'S ANGELS were very cool. I wasn't a big fan of Ang Lee's pictures either. THE WEDDING BANQUET and EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN were fine, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was lovely, but THE ICE STORM was quite disappointing for me and I didn't watch RIDE WITH THE DEVIL because it didn't interest me to see a Civil War art-house starring Tobey Maguire and Jewel. However, CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON received some of the best reviews of the year worldwide, won 2 Golden Globes in January and is nominated to 10 Oscar, including best picture, best director and best film in a foreign language. That changed my view and I started to wait anxiously for it. I saw it yesterday and... Wow! Wow! Wow!The story told in CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON brings nothing new, but what makes the difference is the way it is told. Ang Lee returns to his roots and pays homage to the old Chinese ""Wuxia"" movies, with the story of two women who try to find their place in the 19th century China. Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) is a brave woman and an excellent fighter, who never confessed her love to fellow friend Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat). He has just come back from his long training and now he wants to rest for some reason. He asks Shu Lien to give his sword, ""Green Destiny"", to an old man as a gift. For that, she makes a long journey to his house, where she meets Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi), a young woman, daughter of an aristocrat, who is just about to marry a man she doesn't love. At night, a masked thief steals the sword and that act is what will make all the characters evaluate their strength and their inside feelings.If Ang Lee doesn't win the best director award, I'll be very very angry. First of all, he has made one of the most visually gorgeous and rich films of the last years and maybe of all times. He literally takes us to another world, where you have to leave logic at the door. During two hours, you become so involved in what's happening on the screen that you forget what time of the day it is. If I were him, I would never stop working with the same cinematographer, writer, composer, set decorator, costume designer, editor and cast. The cinematography is triumphant: the colors are rich but never exaggerated, the light and the dark are always on the right place. The music is just wonderful. I loved it! The sets are terrific and so are the costumes, and the editing helps to make the fight sequences even better than they are (we'll get to them in a minute). This is the kind of film made to fit perfectly the big screen. It's really beautiful, wonderful, marvelous, gorgeous! Probably the most well made film of the year. All that with a 15 million dollar budget!!!!!It's not every film, especially a martial-arts one, that has such a complex character development. We can identify with all their dramas and choices, especially Jen Yu, a young woman who wants to run away from conventions and stay with her beloved Lo, but first of all she has to choose what side she should stay: with Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien, who will take her to a training, or with Jade Fox, a mean woman who has killed Li Mu Bai's master and is target of other people's revenge, but has been Jen's master, even if she doesn't know the real meaning of the manual, a thing that Jen is able to understand. In fact, she is her own master and also an amazingly determined person. The relationship between Shu Lien and Li Mu Bai is also very well portrayed and even the supporting characters, as a detective who seeks for revenge against Jade Fox, have their place. This story has wonderful messages about courage, determination, destiny, love and strength. `Crouching tiger, hidden dragon' is a Chinese proverb about hiding your forces, what all the characters do. The screenplay explores many situations and there's even place for some slight humor. By the way, there isn't an isolated genre the film is part of: adventure, romance, fantasy, drama, action, there's all.CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON didn't receive any Oscar nominations for acting, but it is top notch. The Mandarin language sounds like poetry when said by Michelle Yeoh, Chow Yun-Fat and Zhang Ziyi. Believe me, it's never hard to follow- it's delightful. Michelle gives us a quiet, powerful performance as Shu Lien. Chow Yun-Fat proves once again that he is excellent, as Li Mu Bai. But Zhang Ziyi is the best- she is very pretty and acts with security and strength, just like a veteran.Now we finally get to the already famous fight sequences that break the law of gravity. I confess that I found it to be very strange the first time I heard about, but in the film it is breath-taking. If there's someone in your session who laughs when the characters fight kung-fu in the air, just ignore this person because he/she doesn't know what is cinema. The same way there are films that portray life just like it is, as Robert Altman's masterpiece NASHVILLE, there are fantasy films where logic is left at the door. It's more than impressive, it's jaw-dropping when you see what they could do using only wires. The two women running on the roof, Jen and Li Mu Bai walking on the water and especially the same two fighting on the bamboo forest- the most beautiful and memorable scene of 2000. I absolutely adored them!CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON will stay as Ang Lee's masterpiece. I think I couldn't describe how wonderful it is, but if you have seen it you know what I'm talking about. If you haven't, don't think twice: leave the logic at the door and see it on the big screen. Don't worry if it doesn't win many Oscar. GLADIATOR will win best picture, but CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON is much better. It will recover many people's faith in the art of cinema. And prepare yourself for one of the most poetic endings you will have seen.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Really good but...,"Breath-taking scenes. Wonderful fights. Superb acting (I particularly enjoyed Chow Yun Fat). But, hey, where's the story? I mean, the sword has been stolen and must be recovered, but why they keep fighting when there's no need to? This movie is really enjoyable but it lacks a solid plot to support some of the best action scenes in the history of cinema. Overall, I give this movie 7 stars out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time, certainly the best Kung Fu film ever made.  Should be nominated for a whole score of oscars-Picture, director, actor, actress, cinematography, foreign film..etc etc :)  I cant wait for it to come out locally(saw it in paris with French subtitles).  The fights are incredible, now if only Jet Li's american stuff would be this good(come on Matrix sequels!) Check this one out people.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"OK, let's (try) not to contradict it...","The Best: all the most amazing fights (despite Matrix-like) but these were so good that the Matrix ones are bad when compared to these. And visually the movie results as eye candy, that was very well edited and the action musics were good, but the best was the cinematography, and Ang Lee succeded in transporting us to a China that everyone would be delighted to live in. The Worst:  despite of being passed in some kind of Fairy Tale (AH!, AH!, AH!, AH!, AH!), when they were flying you could really tell they were attached to wires, even though you couldn't actually see them, even by the positions they flied. The love story background was supposed to be short but actually it occupied 70% of the film. 4/10I think that in this film I won't even loose my time describing the plot (call me an idiot schmuck but halfway in the movie I was just thinking of the battle scenes nothing more). Kudos to Ang Lee once more by his job, and to Michele Yeoh. Chow Yun-Fat, I don't like him.

Pleasure for soul and mind,"Crouching Tiger is a strange paced movie of motion vs stillness. The contemplative nature of the film and the at times meditative atmosphere should attract even the most stressed-out white collars to the screen. It is, in a way, the kind of story telling that abruptly ceased to be when the ""great"" invention Television moved into our homes, took over our lives and kicked the ancient traditions of story telling out the window. Ironically, the story Crouching Tiger is told by an old projector and not grandma...See this film, for the most beautiful action scenes ever created on film - even the Matrix can´t keep up with it (and I do believe Karate Dojos around the world will be flooded by youngsters in a couple of months), for the stunning scenery, for the genius and sensitive script, the heroic and malevolent characters and for the sake of the old cultural traditions of story telling.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Best Picture of the Year 2000,"""Wo hu zang long""  is by far the best picture of 2000.  Its only competition ""Gladiator"" still falls way behind.  The beautifully-made film does what every great film should:  it takes viewers away from their world and for over two hours places them in its world.  Like ""The Matrix"" this film was exhilarating and fresh, packed with incredible action/fight sequences. The story, however, supported the film far better than ""The Matrix.""  I am by no means knockin ""The Matrix,"" but ""Wo hu zang long"" is a far better film. Credit should go to an outstanding cast and brilliant director Ang Lee who allows nothing to be left to chance in the making of this film.

Instant classic,"Ang Lee outdoes himself with this movie -- he manages to combine legend and myth, with an epic grandeur, compelling love stories, ample humor and wit and some of the best action sequences ever committed to film.  Lee's confidence as a film maker is apparent, as the movie builds slowly to its first daring action sequence -- yet as dazzling as it is, you ain't seen nothing yet.  The tale takes place in vastly different setting, all beautifully photographed.  The story isn't exactly complex, but it is has different moods and tones -- best exemplified by a lengthy, charming, flashback sequence.  The acting is superb -- Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat have that essential commanding screen presence (their really living archetypes) that immediately gives their characters weight.  Zhang Ziyi more than holds her own with these legends.  Awesome is an understatement.Mike Bennett",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Shot to the top of my list of awesome movie experiences immediately!,"As for my movie preferences background (so you'd get a picture of my taste), here's a sampling of my most recent awesome movie experiences (inducing shivers, tears and being dazed for a long time after the movie) - Fight Club, Cast Away, Matrix, Cruel Intentions, Three to Tango, Unbreakable. And these are older movies I can never get enough of - Die Hard (original), Much Ado About Nothing (Shakespeare), Robocop, Terminator 2. As you can see - heavy action and paper-towel romance.Then came along a movie that blended action like we've never seen it before (think Jet Li/Bruce Lee on steroids) and romance like we seldom see it (think Shakespeare & Jane Austen co-authoring) - and I WAS COMPLETELY MESMERIZED. The calmness of daily interactions (& secret romance) and the fury of the fight sequences were an absolutely breath-taking contrast. The excellence of the main cast, the scenery, the plot, the dialogue, the choreography, everything about this movie kept me on the verge of tears for the sheer beauty of it all almost 2 hours straight. Thank you Ang Lee (director) and Yen Woo-ping (fight choreographer) - 10 out of 10, no questions asked.If you don't like action and romance, you'll be bored. If you like only one of the two, you'll be half-bored.

More than you would think,"This film is... a lot of things.I can spend paragraphs using positive adjectives to describe my affection for this film, but alas, my reviewing skills are lame and without proper practice.Ang Lee had a story on his hands and he knew how to tell it. The film is so beautiful and so engrossing for the audience that I really cared and related to the characters.Everything from the score, to the costuming beautifully demonstrates and sets the scene of a feudal China. The characters are so larger than life, which is so great because I really felt that this element brought out the best of the story, it was so epic!!!The fight scenes, whilst almost comical (the gliding aspect that is) were effective and really tense, this film also boasts one of the coolest chase scenes I have ever seen.The dialogue is so well spoken by the characters and their poetic elegance far surpasses my expectations of this masterpiece.A truly awesome film!

Wow! Flying men!,"This is probably the WORST movie that was ever nominated for the Oscars. A complete failure, from all points of view, that somehow turned upside down the heads of all americans (including the critics).Okay, i must admit, it is not really that incredibly bad. But considering that it's been nominated and even won some Golden Globes and Oscars make it look like something really great, which is not.Why, you ask? Well let me tell you.First, the plot. Yes, it's intriguing and complex, but it has absolutely nothing special in it. A plot concerning a stolen sword, the attempts to recover it, everything mixed in with a love story between a girl about to marry someone she didn't love and a crook determined to change.As you can see, nothing special. Then , the dialogues. Some of them are really stupid and unappropriate (maybe it's because of the doubling in English), some normal and only a few really good.The characters: except for the girl, played beautifully by Michelle Yeoh, they are all pretty un-interesting.Okay... then open the book with all the cliches in the american films, and you'll see that most of them are in this one. It's full of them, sometimes i even had the urge of leaving the theater, but the only thing that kept me in was the laziness and sleeping feeling that i had because of the movie. Example of a cliche? The almost ending scene, in which Jade Fox is about to be killed and, just like in all the cheap B-type action flicks, she confesses everything, what she wanted to do and why, because the movie was unable to make you understand these things by yourself.At least the ending was a bit better and saved the general poor aspect of definetely the most overrated movie of all times. But even in the ending, and although i watched the movie carefully, the dramatic scenes never made me sorry, not even one bit. Although in many movies i am touched if the ending is dramatic. Here, i didn't feel sorry at all, maybe because that Ang Lee didn't manage to make you really feel for the characters.Oh, and another thing... the action scenes, although some of them really well made, are so ridiculous sometimes... when there were the flying scenes, with these men travelling like UFO's from tree to tree, laughter raised from the whole theater. And for a good reason.All in all, if you haven't seen this one, don't let yourself be fooled by most opinions in here. This is just another low class asian movie, only with a bigger budget that made it have the door opened in Hollywood.Vote: 4 out of 10.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

vivid analysis of human psyche,"There are people intelligent enough to study things,events and other people in multi-faceted approach with an assessment quality fed into their perception of imagination and reality, and there simply are people that are only capable of seeing through one-dimensional and shallow who are not interested in any way of understanding us,earth-bound humans,our desires,weaknesses,ambitions,etc.That latter description applies to us with our likes and dislikes,the way we approach arts,colors and finally the art of moving pictures what we affectionately call 'cinema'.Being a 'cinema-lover',I usually like every type of movies and try to experience fun,grief,anger,agony,suffering,joy,poetry,filth and so on and I try to see the inner-quality of some when I watch them.I simply like movies for their depiction of atmosphere(Tequila Sunrise),or their anti-hero's way of living and understanding life(Point-break),or director's struggle to reminding us how realities can be contrived or changed,how ambiguous human behavior can be manipulated in all sorts of ways(Memento-Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon).If you try not to see CTHD like a kung-fu flick in which there are people flying rather inanely and see it as a fable dating to thousands of years in which there are poetic calligraphy dispersed reminding us some long forgotten virtues related to mankind of this savage world which are not banal or cheap but that are really needed to ease the atrocities and relentless anger amongst our species.Remember,this is not a real-life story but rather like verse from the ancient times of Eastern culture of when there were the same problems we try to cope with today.JEN is not only a spoiled little rich brat.JEN is me or you all.JADE FOX is not that evil like our-selves,carrying various shades of grey.There will always be people who would rate Battlefield Earth '10' and  CTHD '1'.Such is life!Some films are bound to be longer remembered than others;this was one of them.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Beauty on an epic scale,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is probably one of the most acclaimed foreign language films of all time, and rightfully so. It is one of those movies that, even if you don't love it, you still find it hard to truly dislike. The film tells the story of two warriors in search of a legendary sword that was recently stolen. The trail leads them to a teenage warrior who is going through a difficult part of her life as she has to choose between two worlds that she has become involved in. One is with royalty, the other with a fugitive who she is madly in love with. This is a hypnotic film with a certain quiet beauty to it that is as immaculate as it is raw. The film is pure, alive, and practically flawless as far as filmmaking goes from a technical point of view.It is a film like this that comes to mind when I think epic scale production. This film is grand, glorious, and mighty. And yet it is also gentle, dainty, and beautiful. It is this contrast that so mystifies the mind as you watch it and makes this film very different from any you have ever seen before. I found myself not so much moved by this film, but rather entranced. Throughout the film I was still, focused, and attentive. The film draws you in very slowly and it plays with you as you learn more about the characters and the film itself.The story here is more complex than average and you have to work to keep up with it, especially with all the odd subtitled names. I'll admit that I got lost a few times but I didn't have much trouble catching back up and keeping up to date with everything going on. This film actually plays a fairly cruel trick on you. You think it is very straightforward and won't be difficult to follow. However, as the film goes on you begin to realize that it is much less accessible than you at first thought. You realize this after you've been lulled into this false sense of security, then you have fallen behind and you miss a lot of what has been going on. I still really liked this film, despite being fooled by it, so I definitely feel like it deserves a re-watch.Now, for whatever reason, the people in this film can fly. Yes, fly. Unless I missed it, it is never explained why they can do this, and you just have to take it for granted. But the beauty of it is that you do take this for granted and you quickly buy into the idea that these characters can fly, just because of how well this element is utilized. The martial arts fight scenes in this film are just astounding to watch. The beautiful choreography of these fights turn them more into immaculate dances than actual fight scenes. And they are shot with the utmost care and keen eye for detail. You never miss a single swipe for punch through Ang Lee's fabulous direction of these fights. At first I wanted to call the fights in this movie awesome. But then I realized I was wrong. Lord of the Rings is awesome. Star Wars is awesome. Saving Private Ryan is awesome. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is beautiful.This is a very good film. It tells an epic story that enthralls you from start to finish, throwing in incredibly well orchestrated fights that astound the mind while entertaining the eye. It takes effort to fully appreciate this films story and everything else about it, but it is an effort worth spending. This film is unlike any I've ever seen before and that should be reason enough to call it a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
ST:TMP Meets Kung Fu,"Let me explain. It seems that this movie spent all it's time dreaming up phenominal effects, but left out one key piece of the film... The Story! There is an interlude of about 30 minutes during a flashback in the desert where no special effects are used, and the story is captivating. The rest of the time, it was forgotten.If you remember Star Trek, The Motion Picture, you will recall long drawn out scenes of special effects for no purpose other than to have fancy special effects. This movie suffers the same fate.If you want to see high-flying Kung Fu with a story, watch almost anything by Jackie Chan, or Chow Yun-Fat's other movies like ""Once Upon a Time in China""... If you want to see incredible special effects, then see this. There is no other real reason to watch it.I would love for them to do the desert story as a full-length feature.

Is the Academy brave enough to vote this Best Picture?,"When was the last time you found a martial arts film beautiful and touching? Ang Lee wants to give you something that holds your interest because of its visuals. The story is tailored around the many fight sequences that it contains. The difference, as it turns out, is that these people are allowed to live and breathe and have depth. Lee is not afraid to stop and explore his characters in a way that action/adventure films never do (chicks and dudes alike will enjoy this one, but probably for different reasons).The result is a completely unique cinematic experience. It didn't blow me away like it did for some. I haven't heard many people talk about how comedic this film really is. Lee can't help but borrow this trait from the Bruce Lee or even Jackie Chan school of filmmaking (the fight scenes were orchestrated by `Matrix' choreographer and long-time Jackie Chan collaborator Yuen Wo Ping). In this case, the humor is more obscure. For example, the climactic fight scene (which will go down in history as one of the best ever) between Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) and her would-be apprentice Jen Yu (Zhang Ziyi) begs for laughter. They fight in the middle of an arsenal. Lien keeps grabbing larger, more imposing weapons to use against the magical, indestructible sword Jen has stolen. It lasts quite a long time and by the end, still you wish it would go on.Then there's the Peter Pan' aspect of the combat these warriors use. It didn't work for me much of the time. To Lee's credit, though, at least he's attempted to create something fresh. At times, you can almost see the cable it's so obvious. At other times though, the effect is so cool you can't believe what you're seeing.  I rule in favor of its incorporation, but wish they'd used it more sparingly.`Tiger' deserves the acclaim it's received as much as any movie this year. What makes `Tiger' so appealing is that it's not trying to be an Oscar contender, nor any other kind of contender. It's like Crash Davis (you know, from `Bull Durham'). It just wants to Be. Same can be said of all the films nominated for a lot of hardware this year, `Traffic', `Gladiator', `Almost Famous' for example: they just ended up being really good. For one reason or another, they were weeded out of that vast pool of worthy films (well, not so vast this particular year). `Tiger' is certainly worthy. If it cleans up on March 25, I'll be happy for it.Grade: B",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Completely disappointing and boring,"I have watched kung-fu adventures from a very young age.  I have seen the flying, punching, kicking, blocking before.  I saw the trailers before going to see this film.  I am a cultured person and enjoy Good Movies. Unfortunately, this is not one of them.Being a film student, I must say this movie smacks of cliche.  There was no emotional drama, no entertaining characters.  I was excited to see this film, and I suppose my feelings toward it are a summation of how far I was let down.  That is to say... It completely SUCKED.Although, as far as meaningless pieces of tripe go, Crouching Tiger was not the worst.  The action sequences were well played, although the flying was very cheesy.  Admittedly it is apart of the genre's tradition, but that doesn't make it good.  It was like watching a boring episode of a fantasy television soap opera for 2 hours.On all levels it was pretty much lame.  Characters are forgettable or even hateful, for instance Jade Fox or her protege.  Scenery is nice, though the cinematography was dull and gray.  Action was iffy, split between great sequences to annoying flying and slow motion.  Speaking of action, there is almost none!  There is minute upon minute of bad conversation, were nothing is happening and I'm squirming in my seat thinking how much money I blew, waiting for the next action scene.  This is no way to feel upon viewing a movie everyone is hailing ""epic"".  Don't believe any of these people that tell you different.  This movie is a waste of film.  There is nothing in this movie that I can't see by watching a kung-fu soap opera on a late-night asian channel.  And I have no desire for either.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not your normal review.,"Ok, This is more of a comment for some of the reviewers. Especially torwell from texas. NEVER trust a person that can't back up their comments with an email addy.  He first comments are on the unrealistic nature of the film.  It is based on ancient Chinese legends. The flying and wall climbing is part of the ancient mythology. Europeans are not the only ones to have wonderful stories in mythology.  The film is in Mandarin, not Japanese or Siberian like he alludes to.  torwell's review like so many others,  do not seem to grasp what other cultures may have in their legends and history. You do have to suspend your typical Western beliefs and accept their are other cultures with as rich of a history as our western culture.  This movie is beautiful and mesmerising on so many layers.

"Matches up to ""Hollywood-action"" is understating it!","I have seen this film three years ago and watched the rerun on TV tonight. It struck me only now how this movie matches up to other, Hollywood-ean action movies. A few of the moves you see flashing by, seemingly just thrown into one of the ""lesser"" fight scenes are identical to the ones made to be pivotal to entire action sequences in another favorite of mine - The Matrix.The only thing that bugs me about this picture is my own inability to understand the language spoken - which does limit the experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Only one disappointment...the audience,"The only thing that detracted from this movie was the audience laughing at the flying sequences.It made me sick, and I felt like yelling at the popcorn popping patrons who don't realize that a movie set in China is likely to have Chinese folklore driving it, especially since it's based on a Chinese novel.Other than the audience, this film was stunning.  I must admit that I thought it was going to be ""just another kung fu movie.""  But seeing the details and listening to Tan Dun's incredible score made me a fan.Crouching Tiger is definitely one of my favorites.  I'm not going to be gung ho about how ""everyone should go see it;"" people have different tastes. I'm just sickened by the lack of understanding about context.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is pure magic.","Crouching Tiger enters you as you enter it.  The film is full of magical visions and marvelous vistas.  It is a dream and yet it is also quite real.There are certain precepts that must be accepted to truly enjoy this film. First of all you must accept the idea that the people in this film can fly. One of the great things about Crouching Tiger is that this idea of people flying is presented so naturally, that you find yourself thinking, ""Well of course people can fly!"" The next thing you should bring to Crouching Tiger is some knowledge of the ancient philosophy of China.Those who know nothing about Chinese thought can still enjoy Crouching Tiger, but the more knowledge you DO bring, the deeper you can submerge yourself in this glorious tale of love, honor,and sacrifice. Of youthful arrogance and impatience versus the serenity of the older, more settled scholars.The cinematography is brilliant.  The acting is splendid.  The costumes and sets magnificent. The martial arts sequences masterful and thrilling. The humor and warmth of this film is infectious.  The characters are people to cherish forever.Crouching Tiger is a feast for the eye as well as the mind. I come away from Crouching Tiger seeing something new and always feeling refreshed and enlightened.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Chinese Patient,"Take two tenuously related plots in two different foreign locales, start with one, then splice in scenes from the other at random, add artsy photography and some viewers will assume it is art because they can't figure out what the heck is going on and don't want to admit it. Hey, it worked for the English Patient, and it apparently fooled some reviewers are viewers with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. Me, I don't even understand the title.On the positive side, it was a truly great movie for the first five minutes. The rest should be viewed as National Geographic cinematography. Viewed on my laptop's DVD player the color looked especially beautiful. And the flying effects were extraordinary. If I might make a suggestion, perhaps Ang Lee should make a remake of Peter Pan. Seriously. He got the sense of fantasy down pretty good in this movie. He just needed a better plot, or perhaps running the two plots the movie contains sequentially, rather than on shuffle play.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Spectacular film,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a spectacular martial arts movie that literally combines more genres into it's own. It's rare to find a martial art film that focuses on a progressing storyline with emotional touches and hintful mysteries instead of just the next fight scene. And yet, the fight scenes are still strong and memorable. The wire works are more spectacular, fluent, and graceful compared to other martial arts films. Many others complain about the fake flying and such, but rest assured that this is a traditional theme in various Chinese martial arts films, and shouldn't be an object to lower the film's grade.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Best martial arts film i've ever seen.,"Its hard these days to see a good story and some decent action all in the same film, the only film i've seen that has those qualities are The Matrix and Crouching Tiger.The film boastes excellent cinematography, a great cast and script and fantastic special effects guiding the martial arts.  Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh are great in their portrayal as two legendary warriors who seek to retain the stolen green destiny sword that has been taken from a village sworn to protect it.The stunning Martial arts are what really caught the eye though, from the Grey Fox introduction to the fantastic fight scene in the trees.

the best movie I have seen since Matrix,"Big WOW, definitely the best movie I have seen since Matrix. I had heard good reviews, so I knew I wanted to see it. It definitely didn't disappoint. I am not really a fan of Martial Arts movies, but this one really transcends the genre. Actually, calling it a Martial Arts movie is doing it a disservice as it is so much more.The imagery is breathtaking and is equal to movies like Indochine, Snow Falling on Cedars, The Sweet Hereafter and Ran. However, the action was even more stunning. Think Matrix/Star Wars except no guns or lasers. Actually the sword fight scenes are probably more like what Lucas had in mind.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Story","Okay, I can understand why so many people like this movie...I think. Granted, it is beautifully filmed and the action scenes are wonderfully choreographed, but does that really make a great film? Let's think about it from a different prespective for a moment...First of all, I did not care about any of the characters. Whatever love story or feelings there were between Chow Yung Fat's character and Michelle Yeoh's were completely lost. There was absolutely no developing of that subplot. There was no tension, and when it finally came time for Fat's character to profess his love for her, it seemed forced, unnatural and straight-out stupid. Nothing they had done up until that time suggested that they felt that way about each other. It seemed like the filmmakers just wanted to throw in something for him to make a dying monologue out of.Which is another film, I can't remember the last film that I saw that had so many people with dying monologues. It seemed that every even semi-important character had to go with a long, drawn out speech. JUST DIE, DAMNIT!!Having said that, the dialogue was incredibly tedious to sit through, the acting/characters was about as three-dimensional as a drawing on a piece of paper. On top of all of this, the story seemed to be forced and (excuse me for saying so) not too original at all. I've seen it a thousand times before, only it was done better than this.However, the cinematography was beautiful and lush, the action scenes marvelous, the set pieces gorgeous, the theme breathtaking. But all of that is not enough to make up for the lack of story, plot, character development and scripting.Overall I give it a 5 out of 10. It is DEFINITELY not worthy of ""Best Picture of the Year""...not even close. I wasn't expecting much from this film considering all its hype, but I wasn't expecting to be so disappointed either.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Stand-Out Example of Wuxia in America,"I'll start with the action, which is a minor controversy among people unfamiliar with the Chinese wuxia genre. Martial arts ballet is very common among these films. While this is not the first movie to use it, it is one of the few movies where it fits so well. It layers seriousness when Jen Yu and Shu Lien fight in the dojo; and it adds a lightheartedness when Li Mu Bai fights Jen Yu in the bamboo forest, as if he is toying with her; and it adds comedy when Jen Yu takes on the men in the restaurant. It's kind of an artform. It doesn't matter that it can't happen in real life; if anything, the unbelievability of these scenes makes them exciting to watch. It is, after all, a fictional story. Don't expect everything to be believable.Another noteworthy element of the film which makes this movie a cut above is the acting. There is not a single actor in this movie that did not inhabit his character. Zhang Ziyi, the main character (though Chow Yun Fat mistakingly gets first billing), pulls together the role of a selfish aristocrat's daughter, unfaithful more to those closest to her than anyone else. She also creates good chemistry with many of the other actors in the film, especially Cheng Pei Pei. Chow Yun Fat also does well, even if he was stiff as Val Kilmer. Michelle Yeoh, who acted surprisingly well considering her staple as an action star and despite the poor Mandarin accent, did well to raise the bar, and captured the love-hate relationship between her and Zhang Ziyi's characters. Chow Yun Fat didn't do too well with the fake accent either, but still, the acting was well done. Even the smaller roles--such as Cheng Pei Pei as Jade Fox, Gao Xian as Bo, or Lung Sihung as Sir Te--were amazing. Cheng Pei Pei really made herself a powerful force She may not have been on screen often, but her character, who ties the stories together, is such a presence. Considering the astute use of gesture, it can't be said that this movie had acting that was anything less than amazing.However, the score especially stands out as incomparable. The constant use of string instruments and drum beats is fitting for the action. But what was especially interesting about this score is that a separate theme is composed for each individual relationship: one for Jen Yu and Lo, one for Jen Yu and Shu Lien, etc. You'd think this would be common sense, and many other composers would follow suit, but strangely enough, this doesn't happen often. The only mistakes Tan Dun made were writing the excruciating Coco Lee love ballad ""A Love Before Time--striving to mirror the success of ""My Heart Will Go On""--as well as plagiarizing his own score when composing for Zhang Yimou's Hero.After examining all of that, it is not an overstatement to say that this movie is, by far, one of the greater movies ever made. Ang Lee accomplished his goal of directing a story that would capture the aesthetics of China, utilizing powerful female roles and revolutionizing the American viewpoint of wuxia films. Both the visual and literary elements of the film meld together and create something on a level of its own.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Soaring, beautiful filmmaking!","""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", is most certainly the best movie I've seen this year.  The drama and the action are amazing.  The acting is the best I've seen ever in a karate movie, the best I've seen in a movie this year - it's a crime that Michelle Yeoh wasn't nominated for Best Actress.  The cinematography is genius - the scenery of mainland China is captured flawlessly, the costumes are in turns effectively simple or incredibly detailed.Some of the other people who have seen this film pointed out a few ""flaws"". One of the most ridiculous I can find is people complaining of lack of character development.  This movie had some of the most clearly drawn, complex characters in any movie.  Especially note the characters Shu Lien and Jade Fox - both are masterfully portrayed and are a perfect example of the characters' emotions.While the plot is certainly not the most complex thing, it certainly gives these people a great reason to be running around the country after eachother - the real joy in this movie comes in the interactions.  Any scene in which the three leads are, especially the ones with Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien, sparkles with energy and chemistry.  This movie proves that the karate genre -- no, movies in general! -- are not beyond hope.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Neither did the subtitles detract from the movie one bit.  The principal characters were complex and interesting, and I grew to care about them more and more as the movie progressed.  As for those people who whine about the fight scenes being unrealistic, they simply lack imagination.  I guess they've completely lost any sense of wonder they ever had, and I feel sorry for them.

Not authentic,"Wonder why the film bombed so badly in China itself?  Well, there are probably many reasons but I can tell you one of the main reasons why this film went down so badly with me was because of the Mandarin, especially the Mandarin delivered by the two main leads in the movie.  Chow Yun Fatt's Mandarin was terribly awkward and heavily accented in Cantonese, while Michelle Yeoh's was even worse; extremely wooden and her Malaysian accent was incomprehensible at times.  The only actress who delivered her lines convincingly was Zhang Zi Yi.  It's just not convincing that this is a story set in Ancient China when the leads just do NOT sound their parts; at some points during the movie the audience in the theatre, most of whom understand Mandarin, was rocking in laughter from their terrible diction.  In fact, I don't think it'd be any different watching the English-dubbed version of the movie.Furthermore, CTHD definitely does NOT have the best plot in the genre, nor the best fighting scenes either.  Understandably, the whole martial arts period drama concept was probably refreshing to the Western audience, but it is disturbing to see that the production was banking on this factor to achieve its success.  I've grown up on a staple of martial arts movies and have definitely seen better dialogue, plot depth and gong fu moves elsewhere, even during the '80s!  I found the two lead characters in the movie 2-dimensional and there was hardly any chemistry between them at all.Theoretically I should be happy that a genre that I love has gained appreciation from a worldwide audience, but in fact, it actually outrages me to see that its success was largely based on marketing and packaging, with little attention paid to authenticity.  The latter makes it so obvious that this movie is targetted at the Western audience.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An Epic With Style & Class,"I was stunned to find that this movie was playing in a theater within walking distance of my house. This is not, of course, the sort of movie that generally gets wide release in America. It's easy to see after watching it, though, why this was an exception. The characters are well-developed, the actors who play them give good performances and the action sequences are interesting without being overly bloody. Jen is a girl after my own heart. She's too proud to know when she's lost and too headstrong to know when she's won, but she's *fierce* in a way that few young female characters are. The story of her determination to be free of the societal constraints of her position as an aristocrat, her tutoring by a shadowy warrior called Jade Fox and her love affair with an attractive thief named Lo is one of the two main stories. The other is about two old friends (Yun-Fat and Michelle) who are bound by honor to a dead comrade and therefore cannot love each other as they would like. The two stories are of course intertwined. The contrast between fiery Jen and Lo, willing to do practically anything to be together and the characters played by Yun-Fat and Michelle, who have only a bond to a friend long dead to keep them apart but allow it, is striking. Well done and well worth seeing, 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' just might help break down a couple more of those barriers holding back non-Western films in North America.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A beautiful movie,"Crouching tiger was a pretty good and decent movie. It was beautiful in its landscape and even the actors playing the characters. Set during the backdrop of 19 century china, it tells the story of a young woman called jen. She is played here by ziyi zhang- a beautiful actress who I enjoy seeing often. She takes the roles with everything she had and I loved her fighting style here. We also have michelle yeoh and chow yun fat as master li mu bai and yu shu lien. Good characters aswell and help jen on her journey of ramance and redemption. I loved the fact that all the cast did their own stunts. As the only piece of cgi used for this film was that to remove the wires hanging them up as they flew across the skies and eachother. A brilliant movie overall and one I will sure to come back to.

The acting was superb, and the soundtrack fits the movie as well as humanly possible.I was enthralled by the relationship between Chow Yun Fat, and Michelle Yeoh's characters.

A modern day classic,"To anyone out there who may be thinking, ""Is it me or was this movie not that great?"" Guess what....it's YOU. This movie works in every single way movies should work. Ang Lee must be praised for taking a genre and injecting new life into it by combining eastern filmmaking ideals and classic Chinese folklore with his own gift for lyrical restraint and expert direction. The movie feels like the beginning of a 'new-school' type of martial arts film, where the very idea of wuxia warriors and Taoist fighting as a means of reaching enlightenment is treated with respect and not as an excuse for stupid, ridiculous fight scenes like so many Jet Li and Donnie Yen flicks.In short, if you want a wall-to-wall action flick with fighting from beginning to end, look elsewhere because 'CTHD' is not it. Sure, there is fighting...but the film is also very slow, contemplative, haunting and downright beautiful. Forget the hype, forget the critics, just sit back and enjoy.

I'v seen hundreds of films from this genre, 'Duel to the Death', Tsui Hark's classic 'Zu: Warriors from the Magic Mountain', etc. and I'm happy to say that 'CTHD' ranks with the very best of them.

A Great Achievement in Cinema; a Stunning Epic,"A lot of people would agree with the fact that the year 2000 was a bit weak for film, but Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon makes up for that. Put simply, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is an unbelievable film. What makes it so unbelievable is the fact that everything within is so captivating and so well done.The storyline is interesting and captivating, but it remains fairly simple. The people who made this film did a masterful job of tying in the heart to every scene. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has that warmth to it that makes a good movie great. All of the actors do a great job of bringing this out. Crouching Tiger is so much more than a karate movie, or an Eastern take on the Matrix (something I have heard a few times).The storyline moves through some of the most beautiful scenes I have seen in film. Every single shot in the movie is exquisite and a pleasure to look at. Of course, there are the fight scenes. These scenes are some of the most amazing I have ever seen on film; they easily eclipse the work of The Matrix, Woo-ping Yuen's last movie as fight choreographer. The actors move with such grace and fluidity; watching these people do battle is truly poetry. The fact that they perform larger-then-life moves simply becomes part of the movie.Crouching Tiger has this aura of being a legend; a fantastic myth about a man's journey to get revenge. It's a myth where these warriors fly about with grace and skill. It's a myth where these same warriors do battle to find out what they really are. Ang Lee's brilliant direction certainly propels this. In fact, everything about this movie propels this notion. It's a wonderful, wonderful movie. Everything about it melds effortlessly together, and the end result is a stunning motion picture, and one of the best Ive ever seen.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Just a few explanations,"After reading all the critics from imdb, here is a few explanations. When I watch Matrix in London in summer 99, I have heard people in the cinema talking about how original and cool the actions in the film was. But as a person who grew up in Hong Kong, all those action in Matrix look familiar. The action designer or say choreography of Matrix Yuen Wo Ping (cantonese) had design action for bunch of WuXia or Kung Fu film in Hong Kong (the most famous was Jakie Chan's Snake arm and cat's craw). The Beijing born Yuen who himself is a WuXia novel fan, what he did was just put the WuXia style of duel in  Matrix and showed it to the western audience, not the other way round, which CTHD as a Wuxia film itself copy from Matrix.Lot of Westerners were annoyed by the flying scenes. Basically this is a WuXia film, not a kung fu film. Wu Xia novels is a genre of Chinese novel which usually have adventures, martial arts, fantasies and romance (sometime politics and history) elements. In this world there are different style of Kung Fu masters, from different schools/styles the most famous of these schools included Shao Lin Temple, Wudan (the school of Li Mu Bai), Er Mei, Wah San etc... all these school have different marshal arts secrets plus other special powers such as healing with Qi Kong etc. Usually these masters have different occupations such as monks, robbers, royal guards, leader of society, hermit etc. There  are heroes (usually with sad endings) and villains. Sound more like in a fantasy world, ah? Yes, some Wuxia novels have historical background, but most are like fantasy. In a Hong Kong magazine, it tried to introduced the coming Tokien Lord of RIngs film to Chinese. It used the description 'A western style  Wu Xia Film'. It probably give you an idea what a WuXia world likes.The most famous WuXia Novelist in last few decades are Jin Rong and Koo Lung etc. Another thing need to clarify is these warrior cannot 'fly', they can according to these novels, out run horse in a short distance , leap up 30 feets and can jumping from trees to trees, run up walls etc. This technique is call qing gong which through but physical (running and jumping with lead tight on legs etc) and breathing/meditation can maximise human potential of inner power and reach a state which can control body weight. This technique can usually use for short period time due its explosiveness use up a lot of internal energy and that's why Jen couldn't leap/glide all the way back to down when she tried to save Li's life at the end. All this doesn't sound scientisfical I agree, however Wu Xia novels have exist in China for hundreds of years, long before Newton define law of gravity. Classical chinese Wu xia novelists had use their imagination and myth to wrote all these stories and defined all these speical techniques. Some of these technique are true, such as lightning sword fight, acrobatic kick etc (I have lived Beijing for two years and seen lots of these both in live show and documentry programme on tv) but some could be fictitious , just like spells, alchemy or wizary for Western people, only appears on films, novels and myths. It would be as unrealistic if not to contain those leaping/flying in a movie base on a 19th century Wu Xia movie as not having hobbits and magic in the Lord of Rings movie.Be frank, the flying/leaping scenes in CTHD is not exaggerate at all for WuXia film standard, there are some Jet Li films directed by Tsui Hak in early 90s (such as Undefeatable East etc) had Kung Fu warrioirs leaping up hundred of feets cliff and really flying (not even gliding).My rating for the film is 9/10. The action part of the film is not the best I have ever seen in a WuXia/Kung Fu movie (hardcore martial art fan should go for Jet Li's Once upon a time in China series) but the cinematography, acting and music is unparalell for any movie of this genre, the plot is well develop (I speak Mandarin and I found some of the subtitles were quite misleading especially the philosophical ideas from Li). Which made the movie just beautiful in a scene that it's more like an art than a wu xia film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't hold high expectation,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is not meant to be judged with cinema classics such as The Godfather or Citizen Kane. It's a good and entertaining movie that has something to offer for most audience. The music, cinematography and fight scenes are among the best of its genre. And I'm not talking about kung-fu film in the tradition of Jackie Chan or Bruce Lee. I'm talking about movies like Chinese Ghost Story and Warriors of Magic Mountain, movies that should be classified under adventure/fantasy. If you go into theater and expect to see the best movie of the year, the odds is you are going to be disappointed.Like it or not, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has touched many people. Hey, a lot of folks honestly love Titanic. It has nothing to do with being in denial or unwilling to admit mistake.  Bitch all you want. Do you believe Chocolat which happened to occupy a spot among nominees of best picture  is a better movie?If the number of nominations Crouching Tiger received puzzled you and made you disappoint in Academy Award, it's about time. Of last 15 years among my favorite movie of the year, only Schindler's List came away winning the best picture in Academy Award.Drop your critical lenses and enjoy Crouching Tiger for what it is.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
two thumbs up - watch it!,"Don't miss this movie if you liked epic sagas like Akira Kurasawa's RAN.All the fanfare, color, fight scenes, and the characters make this movie a 'must see'.  Most people feel the same way but I have one caveat - don't get carried away by the fight scenes, they seem too stylistic for reality.Keeping perspective and just sitting back for the colorful presentation is key to enjoying this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A very pleasant surprise,"Coming across what seemed like an old type kung fu movie in the theater surprised me, but since I hadn't seen one in ages and always love the rope work I decided to go see it. Not expecting more than a pleasant way to waste a few hours I was astonished.This movie had everything you almost never see in a martial arts movie: A good plotline, excellent acting, characters that are more than a caricature and excellent filming and scenery. Next to that there was of course the excellent martial arts choreography and rope work one expects from this kind of movie, but here it was a mere part of the whole movie. Not a movie centered on martial arts with a bit of dubious plotline thrown in to make it progress but rather a story involving actual people who just happen to be martial artists.My advice: go and see it!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stunning,"You know, I had full intentions of going on and on as to how great this movie is, but in the end, all I can truly say is, it's absolutely stunning. In particular I'd like to point out the breathtaking performances of Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh.  Considering the fact that they didn't speak Mandarin before this movie, it's a testament to the both of them that they conveyed such emotion.  Try to watch their faces when they speak; it's all in the eyes.Then, of course, there's the fight scenes.  And the symbolism.  And the romance.  And the drama.  And the retribution.People, do not let the fact that it's subtitled scare you off!  I would put this movie up against ANY English-speaking movie this year, confident that CTHD would kick ass!!Absolutely stunning.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Forget about Kung Fu,"Forget about the martial arts.  Forget about the gravity-defying fight scenes.  Please pay more attention on Yun-Fat Chow and Michelle Yeoh, especial Yeoh.As a Taiwanese, I am quite familiar and get used to the ""supernatural ability"" of the characters in kung fu movie .  To me, the amazing fight scenes in CTHD are not a big surprise.  I don't mean that the fight scenes are not worth seeing.  Contrarily, Ann Lee is the most imaginative director on performing kung fu masters' ability.  CTHD fulfills my imagination on ancient wuxia novels.For those who don't like this film and think the flying fighting men in CTHD is ridiculous, just skip the fighting part (although I think it is good). Other than visual pleasure, it delivers a lot to audience as well. Basically, it is a story of love and suppression.  From Yeoh, you can see how ancient Chinese people suppress their feelings, and how the social system suppresses people's free will.I would say, there is a dragon (free will) hidden in everyone's mind.  No matter you are a nobleman, kung fu master, or ordinary person.  Jen Yu tries to release her prisoned mind dragon (desire of pursuing freedom) by learning kung fu and getting connection with bandits.  Conversly, Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien plan to retire to pursue a peaceful life.  However, the results are all turned out to be disappointed.  The reason is that they all resist the responsibilities a feudal society gave to them.Just like her love was ignored by most of people in the story, Michelle Yeoh's acting are ignored by most audience and critics.  She conveys a sophisticated superwoman who is yearning for love very successfully.  The clip of Yu's farewell to Li is really really heartbreaking and touching.  I think most movie association owe her an award.If you are going to see the movie again, I suggest you pay more attention on Michelle Yeoh.  Of course, Yun-Fat Chow's acting can't be missed.  In my opinion, he is the actor second to none in Asia.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Can a movie be more beautiful?,"..........no, I don't think so. Ang Lee has captured the beauty of a scenery and the sounds of a bamboo forest and waterfalls to narrate an extraordinary story of legendary warriors, brave hearts and love. Beyond special effects, this movie combines all necessary elements to be beautiful, as simple as that,and all framed with Tan Dun's music which gets in you. It's hard to believe a film can transmit so much feelings as this one does. Once you've watched Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, you will never forget it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I hate subtitles....that having been said.....GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!,"Okay, here goes....I am known for hating subtitled films by anyone who knows me. I have no patience for them, they are distracting and give me a headache whenever i've seen them before. So I was interested but not overly so when we decided to see this movie because of the subtitles.I left the theatre two hours later with tears streaming down my face, my voice cracking, the hauntingly beautiful Yo Yo Ma-performed score emblazened in my musical mind, and planning to see it a second time in the near future.In short...I know now what I will be rooting for come Oscar night. I am one of simple movie tastes...check out other reviews I have here for the variety I normally tend to see. But I had heard nothing but good to fantastic word of mouth about this movie, and I finally gave in to my fiancee's pleas to see it, and I am so very glad I did.From the first moment of the movie, the cinematography is amazing. And while the subtitles were made a bit more annoying in the first few moments by a doofus sitting directly behind us reading them aloud (then laughing!) for his 3 under-ten children (thankfully they left before the  movie was even half over), I found myself unconcerned by them in the first few moments.This is NOT a movie to see if you cannot accept it as what it is. It is a lavishly produced fairy tale, not your average ""chopsaki"" movie. It is thoughtful in presenation, it's fight choreographer deserves a lapful of awards (although the wire flying was a bit annoying at times) and it's story presented matter-of-fact without any gloss or hype surrounding it.Personally, I thought the scenes between the two young leads in the desert were the best in terms of action and dialogue. They had a chemistry that truly only comes off well in this sequence, and the director's execution of this entire series of sequences left me totally mesmerized.For a guy like me, who used to rank stuff like ""Encino Man"" and ""The Karate Kid"" as his two favorite movies of all time. to like a movie like this is a bit beyond comprehension. But I didn't like it...I LOVED IT. And it now resides atop my list of my all time favorite movies. And if you can fly in an adult-oriented, chinese ""Peter Pan"" fairy tale, you too will be absolutely won over.On My 1 to 5 scale......CTHD gets a 5+! A definate DVD keeper! It will get a TON of use in  my house when it comes out!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Come For Kicking, Stay For The Story","Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon has to be the finest film of the year! 	I had been hearing about this movie for some time now, and I loved the trailer. As a lover of martial arts action flicks there was no way I was going to miss this one. Amazingly still, I had no idea what I was in for! CTHD is the most satisfying movie I have seen in years (supplanting the Matrix). 	A common complaint about most asian martial art flicks is that in spite of the excellent fight scenes the plot and production values tend to suffer.So I came to this movie for its state of the art fight scenes, and was absolutely blown away. But wait, there is a story here and boy, it is well told! Action, romance, intrigue, betrayal, redemption, fantasy, and even effective comic relief! It's got it all folks! 	In his other films Ang Lee has shown great mastery of balance and tone. And here he has created a whole new bag. 	The fantastical flying elements do not detract, nor overwhelm the story. Everything fits. Even the flashback segment, usually the death rattle of many a poorly concieved plot introduces a romantic thread which elevates an already passionate tale to unexpected richness, it is gorgeously funny and sexy! Very sexy! 	The fight scene on the bamboo tops is at once thrilling and sensuous. Much of the action in the hand to hand department involves the female characters, and these are among the best shot martial art scenes on film. Chow Yun Fat is so cool. 	The dialog is in chinese with subtitles, but don't let that keep you away. The plot develops at a pace akin to a flowing stream, rolling with eddies over stones but always moving, always refreshing itself. 	This is a movie of excellent quality and beauty, and it is a great date movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Simply Magical,"It's been about 5 hours since I walked out of the theatre, and my mind is floating thinking about this film.  Ang Lee has put together a film that truly gives everyone a little something, and most a lot more.  If you watched this merely for the action scenes, you would go home so fulfilled you'd probably call this the greatest action film ever made.  But, it is so much more.Chow Yun Fat, Michelle Yoeh, and Ziyi Zhang have a chemistry that has not been seen in quite some time.  When a movie can convince us that there is chemistry between the two leads, we applaud it.  What can we say when the chemistry is so strong between three actors?Many want to compare this to the TV movies they watched on Saturday afternoons when the baseball game got rained out, but this is so very different.  Sure the outlandish fighting scenes are there (in a way never seen before), and the lost article and avenging hero is in place, but this is so very different.  The visuals are so brilliant that one walks out of the darkened theater and the bright lights don't seem that bright.  This film leaves you with a glow that only a few films can.It isn't a perfect film, none are, but it is an important film.  This will do for Asian Films, what Pulp Fiction did for English speaking films.  One thing that is great about this movie, is that despite the violence there is not much gore.  Children of practically all ages could enjoy this film.  All violence and sexuality is implied.If it weren't for the fact that Chow Yun Fat was in ""The Killer,"" I'd say this was his best film.  Michelle Yeoh was amazing.  Ziyi Zhang, left me speechless.  She is the true gem of the movie.  Go out and enjoy.  This is definitely one of those films a 19"" screen doesn't do justice.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The power of poetry.,"Every five reviews or so, there is one harsh criticism of the movie bordering on hate. Yet, a look at the review ratings shows that the number of people rating it from 1 to 3 doesn't even represent 5% of the membership. A movie that elicits that kind of labour of hate from a vocal minority must be special. And it sure is. When I first saw it back in December, I was shocked to see the number of older couples in the theatre. This cannot be a kung-fu movie. And it isn't. Comparing it to Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan is at best ludicrous, at worst intellectually dishonest. When, fifteen minutes into it, Jen flew over Bo and onto the roof, the realm of reality became blurred with that of dream. When the drums started beating as Shu Lien sprang after Jen, the dream became impossibly real, its rhythm being that of our own heartbeats. There is something magically real about Crouching Tiger: the magic stems not from the ""floating"" but the je ne sais quoi, a haunting mood that only fairy tales and myths can achieve; while the reality stems from the archetypal characters with their universally recognizable feelings of honour and dignity, of betrayal and loss. The human dimension elevates it above and beyond the mere wizardry of the Matrix. Freud wanted to show that myths are dreams conveying outwards expression of repressed emotions. Crouching Tiger is a dream and its balletic physical prowess is but a metaphor for  repressed love and aspiration. No metaphor has ever been so viscerally thrilling. When Li Mu Bai chased after Jen on the treetops of the bamboo forest, we know it is not a physical battle but a deeply spiritual one. The swaying branches, the occasional clash of sword, the meeting of eyes, they all have resonances in the dance of conflicting wills. ""What do you know about a true heart"" said Jen defiantly. The material world is just a backdrop. It is not about reality the same way it is not about the comb. Objects, materialness are to reveal their symbolic significance in the world of myth; and the world of myth is to reveal itself in the bending of the laws of materialness. Crouching Tiger is a transcendant movie and like poetry, it is not for everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Max your life...,"Handsome, passionate and fun. This is a great movie, you have never seen a movie like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon because there has never been a movie like it. Ang Lee, a world-class director working at the top of his elegant form, has done something thrilling. For all the leaping action, it's the film's spirit that soars. Rarely has combat been portrayed as beautifully as in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, director Ang Lee's thoughtful meditation on menace, mortality and the martial arts. Brilliance of the action and effects are supplemented by superior and resourceful score by the film satisfies on emotional levels. Crouching Tiger's dramatic line is so blurry that the central character is only a bystander to the climactic fight between forces of good and evil..!?",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sublime and quite overdue!!,"Ang Lee is a genius and it doesn't surprise me that he masterminded such a film so rich in tradition, with an excellent blend of reality and fantasy. After Eat, Drink, Man, Woman, I expect no less from him and he has certainly delivered as expected here.The only thing I'd change, as a Michelle Yeoh fan, would have been to focus more on the motivations and history of the characters of Shu Lien and Mu Bai.  But it looks like the brilliant Mr. Lee is going to oblige me since he's already looking into a pre-quel -- I can't wait!This is also the sort of film the world needed to see to that honors an often misunderstood genre; that of the world of martial arts, its magnitude, depth and complexity . . . and its simplicity.  I fear that within Hollywood, and by extension the film-goers, it is often tossed around as just a form of action as it is so visually beautiful.  This film digs deeper so that it's not so much about martial arts(even though the form is treated with more respect here), it's about love, honor, pain and dreams.Hopefully, with the showing this film made at the Academy Awards this year, the industry will take a closer look at the film making talent outside of the US and allow us to honor more films such as this one.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Transporting, Poetic Film","The legends and myths surrounding the martial arts are extended and brought dazzlingly to fruition in `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,' a sumptuous production directed by Ang Lee.  When legendary warrior Li Mu Bai's (Chow Yun-Fat) meditations take him to a place beyond anything he's ever experienced, a place of darkness and sorrow, he decides to give up the life that has sustained him for so long.  As a prelude to his new life he gives his sword, `Green Destiny,' to long-time friend and patron, Sir Te (Lung Sihung).  But when the sword is stolen and aspersions are cast upon the house of Governor Yu (Li Fazeng), who (with his family and entourage) is a guest of Sir Te's, Li Mu Bai goes into action to reclaim his sword and elicit justice for the House of Yu.  To effect his goal he allies himself with the woman for whom he has long carried unrequited love in his heart, Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), who-- like Bai-- is a warrior.  At the same time, he reaffirms his vow to avenge the death of his master, who was killed by a renegade named Jade Fox (Cheng Pei-Pei), who remains at large. 	Ang Lee has created a visually stunning, lyrical, poetic film that is engaging on a number of levels:  The brilliant choreography  (by Woo-Ping Yuen), especially in the sword fighting scenes, is absolutely mesmerizing, as is the ability of the characters to defy gravity and literally soar up the sides of walls, across rooftops and into the tops of trees; there are sequences in this film that will literally take your breath away.  And then there's the story itself, which is nothing less than a meditation on life and the quest for that often elusive butterfly of inner peace and the resolution and acceptance of one's own destiny.  Blended seamlessly together by Lee, it becomes an artistic triumph of the silver screen that is truly magical; the sheer poetic nature of the film is unforgettable, the images of which will remain in your mind's eye forever. 	The charismatic Chow Yun-Fat is perfectly cast as Li Mu Bai; there is a subtle, introspective quality he brings to the character that is sublime in it's sensitivity-- that of a  man of strength and integrity, worthy of the legendary status accorded him as a warrior, and the respect bestowed upon him as a man of principle.  It's an honest portrayal that rings of truth, which Yun-Fat conveys so succinctly and credibly.  Michelle Yeoh is outstanding as well, exhibiting adroit physical abilities in the action sequences, while also demonstrating her gift as a dramatic actress.  Most importantly, she makes Shu Lien real, and there is a definite chemistry between her and Chow Yun-Fat that brings the story even more vividly to life.  But the most exciting discovery of the film is the young Zhang Ziyi, who is absolutely magnificent in the role of Jen Yu, the Governor's daughter.  It's an extraordinary performance, energetic and charming, and Ziyi has a screen presence that is riveting and commanding of attention. She has a tremendous physical dexterity, and her martial arts engagements with Yeoh and Yun-Fat are melodious and utterly captivating, as is her skill with a sword. 	The supporting cast includes Chang Chen (Lo), Gao Xian (Bo), Hai Yan (Madame Yu), Wang Deming (Tsai) and Li Li (May).  Through the combined efforts of Lee's direction, the exemplary performances of his actors and the expertise of a number of technicians, `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is a film of ethereal magnitude that transports the audience to another time and another place.  Rarely has the screen been graced with with a film of such grace and beauty, and seeing it is a truly memorable experience.  One of the best movies of the year, it is not to missed.  I rate this one 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Most Beautiful Movie Ever,"The movie did really well in Singapore (predominantly Chinese population) where it end up 3rd on the last year's box office.  The local critics and my friends generally love it. So my parents. Don't know why there is so many posts concerning its unpopularity in Asia. To my knowledge, it did very well in Taiwan, Malaysia and Phillipines too.  I think it was mainly North East Asia that snubbed the movie.  It is not like that critically acclaimed Chinese movies have been well received over there.  I wonder what was the box office performance of  Raise the Red Lantern in China.Sure, Ang Lee did not come up with innovative ideas, using the old formulas of Wuxia films. But he sure perfected it like no one else ever did. (hm... remind me of Mozart's perfection in his quartets and symphonies. His concertos and operas belong to another league though....)  Great Acting (if u can overlook the accents), elegant choreography, breathtaking cinematography, gorgeous sets and beautiful soundtrack....I really enjoy the parallel and contrasting love stories (yes the long flashback scene in the desert was necessary!), the difference in how the 3 female leads take their place in a male-dominated society, and not forgetting the ambiguous ending.Truly the most beautiful movie of all time.JP",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
maladaptive personality,"CTHD is a foreign movie from Taiwan with projected audience not just limited to those of the US.  That has been said, I would like to respond to many harsh comments on this epic movie.  First off, precisely because this is a foreign movie concerning a particular strata of subculture in historical China, we, as Americans, should adapt ourselves to the contents of the movie, not the other way around.  It's our ignorance that we don't understand how people defy gravity in the movie, but not the responsibility of the director to fully explain an established subculture (namely, WuXia movies and novels)in the alloted movie time----it would be redundant and totally unnecessary to those who are familiar with these basic elements that sustain the subculture, and incidentally the very audience Ang Lee had in mind.   Now if you have an open mind, even you had no previous knowledge on this flying thing (by using the word flying clearly shows our limited knowledge on this subculture, for anyone who is familiar with the genre knows it's just a established, fantacized Martial art called Qing Kung, or the martial art of lightness), you would regard this as more or less an expression of the mythic nature of the movie, and enjoy what's being presented.  I suppose the people who criticized about the flying probably don't like abstract art either---it's boring, it doesn't reflect reality, or giggle at the seemingly randomized mixture of primary colors and be puzzled by the fact that how this artwork is adored by so many avantgarde art lovers.  That basically leads to my conclusion, a person suffered from maladaptive personality disorder fails to adjust to its surroundings.  The person lives in a rigidly formed reality, and when presented with new facts or situation, maladaptive defensive responses ensued including sweating, palpitation, dizziness, and possiblity fainting, on the other extreme, the disgruntled person will vehemently deny the surroundings, eagerly return to his/her comfort zone, and frequently accompanied with irrational emotions including hatred and extreme fear.  It is okay that you don't know what Wudan or Qing Kong is about, an adaptive person would simply accept these facts or go back home and ask somebody more knowledgeable on East Asian Culture or do some quick research....a maladaptive person after experiencing the aforementioned physiological responses, comes to IMDB and writes a review to present with us his/her ignorance and the associated pathological manifestations.  In the end, this is only a 2 hr movie, and do you really expect Ang Lee to explain everything that is taken for granted by the Asian audience just for us Americans?  Well, after all, Ang Lee is going to make a Prequel and perhaps we would have a better idea about the mythical Qing Kung, WuDan, and the Green Destiny.  After all it is going to take Lucas 6 episodes to tell the star war saga, right?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Beautiful Movie,"This is a truly great movie. All the talk about the fighting sequences, flying and special effects don't really in my opinion begin to describe why this movie is so good. I think that Crouching Tiger is very similar to Titanic in that the story of the boat sinking and the cost of the film and the hype of Dicaprio's starring were really just distant background to a darkly intense story about courage and love. In the same way, the martial arts fighting in Crouching is really just background (a very interesting and exciting one) to a story about meaning in life. The real story is the integrity, loyalty, growth and honesty of the characters. From the innocent beginning of the master's telling of his difficulty in finding peace in his meditations to the devastating honesty of the ending - this movie is an emotional rollercoaster. The music/soundtrack is viciously haunting and mournful. The cello playing by Yo-Yo ma is so beautiful. I remember halfway through the film being momentarily stunned when I realized I was watching a subtitled movie. This movie should be released as widely as possible. I am sure it is in for a titanic of a ride.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
indeed - very good (if you don't know Star Wars),"I only went to see this movie because it's said to be so good by www.imdb.com, one of the top-ten movies ever. So my expectations were very high. During the movie I didn't know very well what to think of it. The story has ups and downs, some very exciting moments, but unfortunately also a few moments almost boring. There were no real surprises in the movie, not even the flying (I knew it from the trailer and I understand it and find it cool) or the Chinese language, it's a very beautiful language.Overall the film got me a very beautiful feeling, the fight scenes are amazing, the acting is perfect, the landscapes stunning, the dialogues intelligent (if you know something about eastern philosophy). There is really nothing in the movie that's somehow done bad. But there's one thing in the movie that disturbed me all the time: I always saw parallels to Star Wars. A few examples:old school heroes (Wudan - Jedi) - a young talented pupil (Jen - Luke Skiwalker) - the swords! - supernatural abilities (flying - Jedi forces or ""the Force"") - the master / pupil conflict - good and bad side of the force - training school far away (Wudan school - Yoda) etc.Look, I don't want to make this movie bad, but I think I've seen Star Wars too many times, for me CTHD is Star Wars in a good ol'china style. And for me Star Wars is the greatest movie ever made, one not to mess with. The story gets predictable if you know Star Wars, and that takes the tension out of it. As I said, I've had a very good feeling after seeing this movie, and for me that's the most important thing, and this movie's got one big bonus: It's not from Hollywood! It's almost unbelievable that Ang Lee has been able to make this film in China, it must have been quite expensive.I'm not sure if you can say this is one of the top-ten movies ever, but it's very good and worth to watch for everyone. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A truly great film.,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is truly a great film. I'm normally very critical towards the films I watch so I don't give this praise lightly. First off, this movie shows the talent level of Hong Kong/Chinese and Taiwan movie making in particular which we North Americans have been so deprived of all these years. Even the recent releases of Hong Kong films in the US aren't even close to the best films that came out from that area. Unlike most action movies nowadays, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon uses action as a means of furthering the story instead of using a plot as an excuse for action. The fight scenes were beautifully choreographed, far surpassing the Matrix and the actors have done an excellent job pulling it off. I enjoyed the Matrix, but it's not in the same league as this film.Don't get confused though. This movie wasn't inspired by the Matrix. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is part of a very popular chinese genre called Wu Xia (roughly equivalent to our swords and wizards fantasy genres), which has existed for a long time. Matrix actually got it's inspirations from this genre because Hong Kong and other chinese regions have come out with such  movies for a long time. The action director and martial arts choreagrapher for the Matrix is actually from Hong Kong and has worked on countless chinese films before the Matrix.I would strongly suggest anyone to see this film, as it's not just an action film, but something far surpassing  it. Films like this don't come by very often so check it out. It's much better and more original than many Hollywood films we get now that shamelessly follows the same formula.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Intriguing Story for all Times and Cultures,"My ultimate measure of quality in a film is how understandable the psychology of the characters is. Ambiguously evil villains and infallible heroes make a story line boring at best and completely derail it at worst. Every character in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is thoroughly understandable and multi-dimensional, complete with desires and flaws. These characters are real people in complex situations and, although the setting and much of the action is highly fantastic, we can all relate to them. The story of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon reaches across time and culture to take the viewer on deeply philosophical and spiritual journey. I was highly impressed with both the acting and the action of the film, truly a masterful accomplishment by director Ang Lee. I was also impressed on how egalitarian the characters seemed, with as strong a set of female characters as has been found in cinema in a long time. Everything about this movie is beautiful, wonderfully directed and choreographed so that the finished product is honestly one of the best films I have ever seen. I would recommend it to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wuxia film to beat all others,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, often cited as one of the greatest of its genre, was directed by Ang Lee. The interesting thing here is that he had never directed a wuxia film before this one, nor has he directed one since. He was apparently content to make this one masterpiece, studying the intricacies of its genre, and then move to other projects, other ideas.And we thank him for this one. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a wuxia film in its purest form. It's a film about mythical China, where great martial artists walk the Earth and clash against one another. Where old grudges carry from the hands of the masters into those of their students. Where swords are mighty, but in the end it's the hands that wield them that matter.It's a sprawling tale, full of turns, characters and locations. As much of an epic as anything the West has produced in Lawrence of Arabia or Ben-Hur, albeit not taking as much time in-universe. Yet there's weight to the world. The sheer beauty of the production of course helps, but it's also entrenched in culture and history. I don't know enough about Chinese history to comment the accurateness of the film's look, but I can safely say that this is the film I think about whenever this period of time in Chinese history is mentioned. It's that iconic.And of course it has a well-earned reputation as one of the best martial arts films ever made. Sure, some of the fight scenes are pretty out there, jumping from one bamboo branch to another, but the fact that the actors performed most of their own stunts and that the wire work on display is so well-made, gives it heft. And there are some truly great battle scenes happening on the ground where you can feel every blow, grit your teeth with every near miss and gasp in pain whenever a hit is scored. The fight between Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi in the dojo is especially noteworthy in this regard. Still one of the best fight scenes I've ever seen, even after all these years.One of those rare action films that have a definite serenity to them. A film only two hours long, yet telling a story most TV series would struggle to fit into a season. And making it look breezy and effortless. Easily one of Ang Lee's best and one of those film I can easily name a masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Breathtaking, extraordinary, one of the very best.","Just saw this and was overwhelmed with all facets: its direction, stars, cinematography, special effects and subtlety. I was reminded of fairytales told to me as a child, complicated fables with characters who were brave and foolhardy but who accomplished great deeds.  Here in a China of indeterminate time, the women are strong and fierce and are trained as warriors, sometimes surreptitiously, in spite of the male dominated society. The story involves a sword, Green Destiny, which has wonderful powers and strength, a la Excalibur. The special effects alone are so well done it is worth seeing for just these.  I watched the director's cut also to see how they had accomplished this, as it is obviously not digitally.  The actors had to take a lot of risks with harnesses and gliding over such enormous distances. I rarely ""feel"" the magic of a movie, but this one with its wonderful love stories of equality and understated sensuality has every other movie of the year just about licked.  A 9 out of 10. Bravo to all involved in it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Pure poetry in motion!,"Oh yes! That's EXACTLY what this film is! Poetry.The fight scene's are works of literature that no book could try to describe - I'm not even going to insult the film by trying to analyse and describe them!! (mind you - the film itself is based on a book, so maybe you can describe the fight sequence's!)Some people have bashed this film because of the plot's impossibilities, and the impossibility of people flying, and jumping as high and as graceful as the characters in this film can.GROW UP!!! Yeah, that's right - GROW. UP. For the two simple reasons1) It's a bloody film!! 2) Ever heard of the expression 'suspension of disbelief'?!Anyway, this film is beautiful to look at, and worthy of the Oscars that it won.The love story is pure tragedy, and I cried like a fool at the end!!!So, with great set pieces, great characters/acting, splendid direction, and graceful choreography this film is a delight to watch.Do yourself a favour - WATCH this film!PERFECT 10!Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The brightest star...,"Some reviewers here are calling for Zhang Ziyi to be nominated for the 2001 Oscar for best supporting actress. Are they sure? If at all, it should be for best actress! Hers was the character around which the others revolve.I could see this film over and over again  once at least, to soak in the drama, action and atmosphere; once to savour the poetic Mandarin dialogue (such as: Jen, `And this little boy who fails to find his star turns instead to stealing my comb.' Lo, `I'm a man now, and I've found myself the brightest star.'); once just to wallow in the haunting score; and once to focus on Zhang Ziyi alone...her sweet curious innocence as an aristocrat's daughterher poise yet potency in battleher tearful defiance under the strain of force from her pursuersher feeble resistance to submission while in a drug-induced stupor I just love that scene of her eyes welling in tears as she was on the verge of being unveiled.No, the Oscar will not stand up to your talent, Ziyi, and this is only your second film! Yet, alas, your star is shining so brightly now that you will soon be lost to the big studios and end up in some low Jackie Chan or Hollywood action flicks, or to some directors more obsessed with you than making a good film.

"A Spiritual Experience In Color, Sound And Motion.","This is a one of the very rare movies that I enjoy seeing mor than once. It is an epic tale in sight, sound and motion. Scenes of rich beauty, elegance and aesthetics, slowly paced, alternate with those of high speed and incredible acrobatics. It's a story of contrasting loves, of morals and virtues, of indecency and greatness. From different perspectives man's age old search for self-fulfilment and freedom is told. There is the Crouching Tiger, the passionate young aristrocat and there is the Hidden Dragon, the wise scholar who has mastered his martial arts to a level of mere intention. Both fail to reach their goals as humans, bound to physical appearances. However, both know that there is a future, created by their love, trust and will.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A masterpiece,"Not only in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Tiger a great showpiece of Chinese talent, it is also an excellent window into Chinese culture and folklore. I hope this film gets the exposure it deserves, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen any Chinese fantasy films to go see it - the action sequences are a breathtaking mix of crazy acrobatics and swordplay. It is a film of epic proportion - of legendary heroes, honour codes, and ancient grudges. The film is beautifully shot, from the vast deserts of Western China to the lush green mountains and the bustling citadel of ancient Beijing. The sets are comparable to the Emperor and the Assasin. The attention to detail also adds a level of belief to this movie, as evry extra has a unique get-up or weapon. I cannot express just how impressed I am with this movie with mere words. After seeing this film, I kinda wished I could read Chinese so i can actually read the books. If you dug movies like Once a Upon a Time in China, or The Blade, I highly recommend you watch this. I look foward to the sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magical and mythical,"Crouching Tiger Hidden dragon is a transcendental experience. With exceptional fight choreography, Zhang Ziyi, lush cinematography, Zhang Ziyi, beautiful score, Zhang Ziyi, it effortlessly pulls you into a world of wonders.

Transcendental--Young Actress Kicks Ass,"A deep, unrequited love between two old friends; an impetuous, sexy romance between two young lovers; the most beautifully choreographed martial arts scenes ever; broad, sweeping landscapes shot all across an exotic land (China).  This movie has everything you'd ever want spun in a plot that continually pulls you in deeper and deeper.What really did it for me, though, was the acting of Zhang Zi-Yi, who made the Charlie's Angels look like a bunch of bloated, spoiled Hollywood actresses who spent a month training to look like kick-ass women, but ended up congratulating themselves for a feeble half-kick in the air.  Zhang lit up the screen with an authenticity, ferocity, and an air of un-self-consciousness that you just don't get in Hollywood or on American TV.  She stole every scene that she was in, even from the formidable talents of Chow Yun Fat and Michelle Yeoh.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Avoid this film like the plague,"To anyone who thinks this film is great or even good-what is the matter with you! This is one of the stupidest movies I have ever seen. Shame on Ang Lee for making such a piece of garbage. I feel like Ang Lee robbed me of two hours of my life. I have no idea how this movie is getting such high reviews. This film makes the cheesiest,most low budget Chuck Norris movie look like masterpiece theatre. Bruce Lee would be rolling over in his grave if he saw this poor excuse for a kung fu movie. It is so unrealistic. I don't understand how people can fly in this movie. The people flying look so stupid! Just about equally unrealistic is how these girls can outfight men.

An modern epic that isn't glossed over. Hooray!,"It has been quite noticeable how heated the Gladiator versus Crouching Tiger debate has been after one triumphed over another.  These two films show the difference between a real Hollywood Studio Epic, and storytelling which is firmly in the control of the director.This film, on the surface, tells the events of a Chinese mythical tale.  It has leanings towards martial arts, and, due to its 'fairy tale'-like style, it also contains unbelievable scenery.  However, this film also succeeds in that it doesn't try to force its issues ( loyalty being the most recognisable), and neither does it have cartoon-like villains or heroes, unlike the all too unbelievable story of 'Maximus' or Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace.  The final thing that really made this a 'special' movie, was how interesting the quieter bits of this film are.  Not many films can keep tension so effectively, and it seems to be something that Ang Lee is particularly good at ( look at the Ice Storm).  The ending to this is also so serene and understated. It's truly wonderful when a film can give so much respect to its audience, and not be overbearing with a big orchestral score, or pretensious and unrealistic speeches by its lead character.This movie doesn't directly answer any of the moral questions it puts foward, and although this could be considered laziness, I think that it also allows you to consider what you have scene totally open mindedly, rather than having conclusions shoved down your throat (like that awful speech in Pearl Harbour.  A movie which is totally enjoyable.  Essential.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon = best movie ever!","well certainly in my books. This movie is soooo good. The acting, the action, the scenery etc.My hand went numb after watching the rooftop fight because it had it clenched for so long while watching it. I forgot to let the circulation in it was so good. The fight scenes are awe-inspiring.And the scenery... my god the scenery. Will there ever be another movie with such beautiful photographed landscapes such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (Wo hu zang long)? Probably... but not for a while. The forest covered mountains to the Peking-villages, all look stunning.And the scene with Jen and Chow Yun Fat's character (I can't remember it) on the treetops is brilliant. They really are in the tree, they're not using crappy computer generated visuals (okay so in some movies they're not crappy but...). And a lot of the scenes where characters are 'flying' actually look realistic. Some of the people in my cinema were laughing at them because some of them didn't but they look great.I bet you would never see a single string or wire in this entire movie (unlike movies along the lines of Anaconda, which I heard a rumor about having a sequel made, hah!)And the ending... It was only a tiny bit predictable but that can be forgiven in such a fantastic movie. The final scenes in the compound area look really great. the mist and the buildings... they look so beautiful atop of the mountain.This movie is a work of art and should not be missed by anyone!And wouldn't you hate to walk up the set of stairs near the end of the movie?!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I cannot recommend this movie.,"As proof positive that I attended this film and did so with an open mind, I even arrived on time and saw a delightful promo for Hannibal.  With one hand in the popcorn and the other on my cell phone, I eagerly awaited one of the most anticipated films of the year.  Such promise, and so easily thwarted. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Ang Lee's meticulously crafted, odious tone poem, together with its Lawrence Welk-ish soundtrack, left me mortified. But before I get into the details, let me first thank Mr. Lee for challenging all of my romanticized assumptions about 19th century China.China, long open to outsiders like Bernardo Bertolucci who were unable to offer an authentic critique, has finally permitted one of its own to do just that.  Enter Ang Lee, attempting to set the record straight with his own brand of revisionist history as told through a cliché kung fu morality tale. As visually stunning as Crouching Tiger arguably is, one cannot help but notice Mr. Lee's overbearing reliance on cheap, gimmicky special effects and tediously over-choreographed swashbuckler sequences, of which there are far too many.  If this film has a point, it is buried under the weight of its snobbish nods to Shakespeare and Moliere.  Gone, apparently, are the days when a film could survive on its own merits rather than rely on the tiresome crutch of allusion and mimicry.  Yes, the film is dazzling and glitzy, but those attributes are no substitute for accuracy, authenticity, originality and grace.  Exactly how many sunsets and moonscapes can one cram into a two hour movie?  Just ask Ang Lee.Unlike past projects where Mr. Lee has proven himself to be an arguably competent director and storyteller, Crouching Tiger is a formidable and inaccurate mess.  It is no English Patient.  I have often been fascinated by Asia Minor, and China is no exception.  This film so completely whitewashes the Tienamen Square incident that perhaps Mr. Lee was unconsciously expressing a repressed love for the works of Leni Reifenstahl.  Seeing this movie, you wouldn't think that the Chinese ever ate rice, grew or smoked opium, or went to the bathroom.  You would think that self-censorship was a good thing.  You would want to run out and build hydroelectric dams to wipe out whatever beauty remains in Taiwan.  You would want to subsidize plastic surgery for the ugly, guns for the unstable, and showers for the homeless. But Crouching Tiger's artistic license does not end there.With the principal actors suspended from barely erased wires like marionettes, I half expected Fran, Kukla and Ollie to take up arms and battle the equally riveting Jade Fox.  Each character is a caricature; each misplaced and overwrought emotion a manipulative scam.  It is as if Mr. Lee dug a little too deeply into his emotional core, defiantly putting onscreen a half-hearted project that would have been much better left on stage at the local dinner theater.  Such audacity is unbecoming.  That being said, I have little doubt that Crouching Tiger will nonetheless have certain less discerning critics soiling themselves with diarrhea-like approval.In the interest of full disclosure, I confess that I have not and do not intend to read the source material, which undoubtedly has all the poetry of a Harlequin romance, and the style of a bad television miniseries.  Still, one must give Mr. Lee brownie points for setting a new low watermark for cinema.  In appealing to the lowest common denominator of soothing the audience with hypnotic images and mind-numbingly familiar content, Mr. Lee here joins the ranks of Steven Spielberg and Nora Ephron.  It's like going to church, only it's easier to fall asleep.  It's as if Mr. Lee conceptualized and edited the movie while on autopilot.  Which guarantees a smooth ride, but I fear that life's complexities are not best explored through paint by numbers, plug and chug filmmaking.Please don't mistake my constructive criticisms as bitterness.  I have full confidence that Mr. Lee will one day make a movie that meets with my approval.  But until that day, I shall not forget the saccharin aftertaste of his latest effort.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable fantasy, martial arts film made to high standards in many regards.","One film critic said of, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: ""it's not really a fight film, it's a dance film"". The expertly and beautifully choreographed, filmed and edited action scenes in this film are indeed graceful and most pleasing to watch. This film masterfully combines drama and romance in a fantasy martial arts period film. It's a highly imaginative film which successfully combines a variety of film genres together. This Asian film from Taiwanese director Ang Lee received a huge 11 Academy Award / Oscar nominations, the most ever for a foreign language film. From my perspective, everything works, and is done to high standards in this film. Directing, writing, cinematography, film editing, choreography, art direction, costumes, makeup and music score. There is a emotional resonance in this film, rarely done so well in the action genre. The martial arts fighting scenes are impressive to experience for how skillful they are thought out and executed.

Hard to put into words,"This film is almost too good for words.  Whilst watching it I was mesmerized by the kung-fu scenes, the dazzling swordplay, and the incredible scenery. It was as if the storyline and characters took a back seat to the immediacy of visual stimuli.About 30 minutes after I left the cinema I began to realize that the best things about the film were the very things I hadn't noticed as I was watching it.  The story is strong and combines so wonderfully with the incredible character development that I feel I HAVE to see it again to learn more about the characters, because I know there are things that I missed the first time around.  Oh yeah, I suppose it will also be nice to see the action sequences again, which, by the way were the best in any movie of this type I have ever seen.So there you have it.  It is a film that features some the best kung-fu scenes of all time.  But the kung-fu scenes are not the best thing about the film.One more thing.  I know that there are people in the USA that will refuse to see this film because of the subtitles - one guy walked out after about 90 seconds of the showing I went to.

A True Work of Art,"Director Ang Lee has elevated the *Martial Arts* film genre to an entirely new level. Using the tried and true story of revenge common to all HK Kung-Fu films as the basis he has created a masterpiece!Everything about, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", works to perfection. As Master Li (Yun-Fat Chow) says, ""The sword is but a piece of steel, mastery comes from the arm that wields it"". And use the *Green Destiny* they will! Skill without knowledge is the lesson here. This is both then an action film as well as a spiritual journey as the characters develop their relationships to each other and to the *art* they seek to master. Li Mu Bai & Yu Shu Lien, they share a love tempered by the ways of honor, bound by the old traditions of Wudan. Lo (bandit) & Jen (princess) find a new love unbound by tradition even though they come from different sides of the *tracks* as the story goes.Thus Jen must find a balance between *skill* and *Wisdom* to become a Wudan Master.This story is a wondrous adventure, covering a landscape beautifully filmed by Peter Pau. The costumes by Timmy Yip are all first rate as is the set direction. The martial arts choreography by Woo-Ping Yuen is without equal and to answer a question about cultural differences between *West & East*, re: flying.....what's the difference between flying over rooftops and Hercules picking up a 10 ton stone and tossing it 15 meters? We deal with mythos here where logic gives way to imagination.The only question I ask myself when leaving the theater is, ""was I entertained?"".

About 45 minutes in I realized that not only had I given up on the film being anything extraordinary, but I had in fact become bored. I glanced around the theater to other movie-goers. To be honest, I couldn't get a good read on the theater audience. I will say that no one looked as bored as I did. I felt as though I was watching an overly arty Jackie Chan movie.About an hour into the movie I excused myself and trekked out to the lobby.

Only once before....,"When I was nine years old, I saw a movie that touched me so deeply, it would inspire my childhood imagination and leave such a lasting impression, that I can still recall smells, sounds and tidbits of memories from the movie theater when I first saw it. I've seen it many dozens of times since, and although I am 34 now, there are still parts of the soundtrack that send chills up my spine as I associate them with that miraculous magical childhood moment.I have since lamented that I would never be affected by a movie like that again, assuming that one, I am not a child any more and simply am not as impressionable, and two, the magic that I felt from that movie is just so rare I would never be lucky enough to experience it again.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon proved me wrong. This movie is pure magic - fantasy for adults. It was released at just the right time for me, as I am a long-time film lover, I have lately become jaded by movies. I think most of what comes out of Hollywood is crap. And if not crap, then simply roller-coaster extravagance - fun to watch (see Matrix, Independence Day), but not particularly awe-inspiring. The combination of the poetic action and storyline combined with the haunting soundtrack produced an effect on me not felt since I saw the movie I mention above when I was nine years old - Star Wars.I find it difficult to believe so many reviewers here found the movie to be ""silly,"" ""shallow,"" and found the 'flying' to be ridiculous. What do you want from film? An overreaching concept of reality mixed with suspension-of-disbelief that comes off as factual??? If not for magic/fantasy, where would be our Peter Pans, our Lord of the Rings (I cross my fingers in hope of a good movie), our Superman?And as for you folks out there who prefer Jackie Chan slapstick to a masterpiece like this, well, we're all entitled to own likes/dislikes.

Ang Lee blends action and romance with strong production values resulting in one good Wu Xia film.,"I haven't seen many Chinese films in my early years so I wouldn't know much about Wu Xia, but apparently it's a broad sort of film genre that evolved from Chinese fictions concerning the adventures of martial artists set in ancient China. Ang Lee had mentioned quite a few times that he wanted to make a Wu Xia film, and I don't see why he shouldn't, it sounds like a very interesting scenario that would definitely attract some audiences. Finally he followed through with it in the year 2000 and received immaculate results from both Chinese and American viewers. It went on to being nominated for 10 Academy awards, coming out victorious in four categories including Best Foreign Language Film.Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is a wonderful experience with excellent production qualities and a near perfect line up of Chinese actors. There's so much to like about this film that it makes it almost impossible to deny its brilliance.Crouching Tiger is a story of passion, revenge, tradition and above all things, love powered by three main characters. Li Mu Bai and Shu Lien are two warriors and long time friend's that both have deep feelings for each other, but past and current events keep them from admitting their true feelings. Jen Yu is the young governor's daughter who is unsure of where or who her heart and loyalty lies with, her master, her love, or herself. Jen seems like a confused mind. She makes rash decisions and jumps from place to place with no real intentions, which is actually something I noticed in a lot of the characters in this movie. The decisions they make don't seem to keep within their character very often and their intentions are seen as unclear throughout most of the film. The story progresses somewhat aimlessly making it difficult to appreciate, never the less it doesn't stop the story from taking toll with the themes nor does it lower interest in the invigoratingly romantic scenes and the oddly appealing conflicted relationships between characters.Like I said, it's really hard not to like this movie. There so much to offer that it stages out all possible criticisms and eliminates any doubt that it will appeal to audiences of all kinds. Like for example if your one of those action folk that are not really into the touchy, feely love story, no worries, your needs will be satisfied with Crouching Tiger. The martial arts choreography is kick-ass fantastic that matches some of the best Matrix inspired films, and while I found the wire-work in this movie to be way to obvious it was nice to see an action flick that wasn't ruled by visual editing, I guess that's Ang Lee's take on traditional Wu Xia film making. He takes us back to a time where we didn't have advanced computer programs to distract people from the decreasing population of good storytellers. Mr Lee proved himself to be a good storyteller for that very reason and I applaud him for it.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is in my opinion Ang Lee's best achievement ever. He takes hold of us visually and emotionally and it's very hard to let go. I highly advise you to see this movie, it's beautiful and breathtaking, you will love it so many ways.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The fighters appear to have the magical ability to almost turn off gravity. They can take long slow motion leaps or run up walls.The net effect is boredom. I fell asleep over and over.The characters are driven by infantile revenge and even more petty motives. They belong to a warrior cast who kill each other for amusement. When someone is killed in this game, they blame the evil killer rather than their participation in the game.The fights involve hitting and kicking each other. These blows have absolutely no effect on the opponent, even when endlessly repeated.There one fight scene in a restaurant and one in a tree canopy that shows more imagination. I found it hard to keep track of who was fighting who and why.There is a bit of comic relief, reminiscent of The Taming of the Shrew between a handsome, good-hearted, desert-dwelling falconer and a pretty young woman who preferred adventure to a stifling life in an arranged marriage.The majority of the fighters are female. I think at least one of them was over 40 and another over 60. They were fully athletic. I expected the fighting to limit actors to their early 20s.Others have recommended this movie. They must have a much higher tolerance for repetition than have I.It is in Chinese, with English subtitles. In one scene, a character is surprised that the ""Jade Fox"" villain is female. This seems odd because they have been referred to her as ""she"" in the subtitles. In Chinese, they use the same pronoun for he and she, so that pronoun did not give her gender away.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My favorite film of 2000.,"I have been anticipating this movie for some time now.  With all the great reviews I've read of the movie, I was afraid that my expectations had grown too high.  I am glad to say that I was not disappointed in the least. Chow Yun Fat's screen presence dominated the scenes that he was in.  Michelle Yeoh and Zhang ZiYi were both wonderful, in oscar-worthy performances.  If the Academy Awards truly rewarded the best film of the year, ""Gladiator"", ""Traffic"", and ""Erin Brockovich"" would not stand a chance, and I've seen all of them.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Unutterably Fantastic,"This movie is nearly perfect. I saw it on new years day when I was suffering from a killer hang over, but I completely forgot about it within 5 minutes of the film starting. All human life is here. Joy, Tragedy, good, evil, action,tranquility, love, hate, conflict and peace. The film defies classification. Is it a romance? (to violent) Is it an action film? (to contemplative) Is it a martial arts beat em up? (to beautiful and balletic). SEE THIS MOVIE.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I was simply amazed.,"This movie was good for so many reasons.  The screenplay (which I read first) was very simple yet very powerful.  When I finally saw the movie I was completely blown away by the style in which it was shot and the sound which was used.  The music for this movie was beautiful and quiet enough so that it didn't overtake the scene that was happening.  This was not the normal Martial Arts movie, this was something that crosses all major boundaries between action and drama.  Everyone, even the doughnut boy, should be proud to have worked on such masterpiece.  Thank you very much!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best Kong -Fu/Martial Arts film I have seen,"Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon is a very special film.Its elegant and yet simple story telling, backed by its relaxed pacing and bleeding cinematography makes it just about the most beautiful and elegant martial/Kong-fu film I have ever seen.The best feature of this work is its simpleness to follow. Unlike many Martial arts films I have seen,the audience has very little to do,but to be engaged, and this is refreshing.The Story is magical and captivating from the first frame to the very last and Ang Lee's use of the Western Chinese landscape,is truly breathtaking and stand as a character in itself.What is unique about this story is that it is in equal parts a mystery and at the same time time an enthralling tale of unrequited love,set against a rich display of Chinese culture and visually explosive Martial Arts skills.The ensemble of actors were incredibly strong. Yun-Fat Chow, Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang, delivered impactful performances right through and the musical score was especially tantalizing, together somehow transplanting you to this era of china and this was truly an achievement.The only qualm I had with this film is that the character Jen (Ziyi Zhang),could have been a bit more developed.I found myself at times questioning her motives and struggling to understand her loyalties.In truth,an additional ten minutes of screen time could have better helped the audience to fully understand her as a character.However,with Crouching Tiger:Hidden Dragon:Green Destiny on the horizon in 2015,am hoping she gets her due as much as I would get the opportunity to grace this magical world once again.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The worst movie in years,"When I heard of this movie, I was suspicious. It had great reviews; all my mates were recommending it. I said to them ""Are you sure? It sounds like just a run-of-the-mill kung fu movie which has somehow squeezed into the mainstream movie scene"". ""No way, it's the best movie I've ever seen,' they said. I couldn't believe how correct I was.The only explanation for the popularity of this film is some kind of mass hysteria caused by the shock of seeing a kung fu movie for the first time. Maybe to a virgin of the kung-fu genre, CTHD could have been an interesting experience away from Hollywood (but this movie still feels Hollywood to me).In fact CTHD was so much like so many other kung-fu films I've seen and can't remember the names of. It shares all these same characteristics - a poor, but prominent love story, croony music to accompany these scenes, dying heroes (with croony music) and of course, crazy kung fu. I am disappointed to say that CTHD was inferior even to these other, average kung fu movies.Of course, kung fu fight scenes are unrealistic, but in most cases they are at least believable in context. Jumping off walls and from roof to roof may be hard to believe, but it sure would look cool - that is, if it weren't so obviously fake and as poorly done as CTHD. Super jumping skills I can believe, but not ""floating"" over the rooftops and never setting a foot on them. The fight scenes were few and far between (as with most of these romance kung-fu genre) but were nothing special even when they finally arose.The storyline, really, could have been reduced to a couple of sentences when you think about it. In this respect CTHD is a little different from these other kung fu films I mention. These, at least, have some kind of plot twists and intricacies to the story.Everyone I went to see this film with felt ripped off, and it irritates me to hear how much this movie is loved by a lot of people. I am not a kung fu film addict who wants to pick apart every movie. But among all of the movies I've seen (a lot), I've seen a good share of kung fu's, and I generally like them.I could gripe all day, but to sum up: If you want a funny, fast paced kung fu film - go get an old Jackie Chan one. If you want a serious, period kung fu film with fancy wirework fighting - go get a Jet Li film. It doesn't matter which - just randomly pick one off the kung fu shelf at the video store. I guarantee, whatever it is, it will be a better example of a kung fu film (and a better film in all respects) than CTHD.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"My favourite Ang Lee movie, and well-deserving of its accolades!","Easily my favourite of Lee's films, plus this was a no-brainer for me to watch, since I love martial arts films and the three stars. Peter Pau's cinematography and Dun Tan's soundtrack deservedly won two of the four Oscars, amidst its ten nominations, but even though the production values and story were the reason that this, rather than more significant martial arts classics, such as 'The 36th Chamber of Shaolin' and other Shaw Brothers' masterpieces of the genre is that it stepped outside the box and became mandatory viewing for both genders and all cultures with its love story, in the same way that 'Rocky' isn't simply a boxing movie. Still fascinating watching today, and the scene in which the restaurant is destroyed is one of the most fascinating set-pieces I have yet seen.Just afterwards, I was watching a behind-the-scenes featurette on 'L.A. Confidential', which I hope to watch soon, and director Curtis Hanson had the completely antithetical approach to that film, for he said he wanted to make the surroundings great, yes, but kept in the background so that the acting performances captured the viewer's attention and shone through. It's a shame that Michelle Yeoh, Yun-Fat Chow and Ziyi Zhang weren't nominated for Oscars, but I believe that was why: Our attention was so much on the production values and the story that unfortunately the actors left less of an indelible imprint on us than they deserved to.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hidden between the fighting,"Let me begin by stating that I take almost childish delight in watching martial arts movies. I love the acrobatic movements and perfectly synched fighting while the story is often just a vague framework linking the eyecandy fights.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, as it refers to the hiding of yourself to someone else, is much more than just another Hong Kong martial arts movie. Quite the opposite to why one is used to watch Hong Kong movies, the fighting scenes are more like interludes between the different parts and acting out of the story, rather than being its main purpose.This movie was not quite what I expected, it came out way ahead of that. The twin story of love makes up the main plot, circled by the subplot of a stolen sword. However, anyone who plan to see this movie for its fighting scenes will perhaps get a bit disappointed since it make up only a tiny fraction of the total time. (But do not fear, the quality and choreography when it happens makes it well worth waiting for! It is breathtaking!).Perhaps it should not even count as a Hong Kong movie at all? Many scenes rely on subtle glances and facial movements, making the movie slow and perhaps unbearably boring to anyone who expects action and fighting throughout, but nevertheless is most important to the story and the ""crouching and hiding"" of the characters to each other.My advice is instead to concentrate on the main story and how it comes to a full circle in the end as what was hidden finally is brought to light. The story is beautiful but not always obvious. Watch for what is hidden and crouching, what happens when it is brought into clear vision, and the ache of understanding why it had to be.I loved it, not for being a Hong Kong movie, but for not being it.See it. Just see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolutley Amazing,"This movie is by far the best I've seen all year, and perhaps all my life. If you haven't seen it, see it!  The story is dazzling and keeps you excited the whole way through.

Must SEE if you are Hong Kong Action fan,"Incredible movie.  Epic in scope.  Not just an action film, but moving love story.The action however, is spectacular.  As with Hong Kong movies, there has to be some suspension of disbelief as the fighting styles are entrenched with mystical abilities.  Flying/Jumping 30, 40 yards over buildings etc.What really got me is the jumping onto rooftops is nothing new, but the action scenes are long cuts instead of jumping to several camera angles. Several of the scenes you'll see the actor run up a wall, onto the roof top, then jump long distances, land and fight.  I would like to have seen how they choreographed the whole stunt scenes.  Swordplay is absolutely breathtaking.  I can't say how much I enjoyed this movie.Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun Fat besides doing great stunt work, are great characters in this movie.  One of the best fantasy films.  Something you'll never see out of hollywood, with the exception of maybe Mortal Kombat.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The essence of a message,"I wish I could fly. Not fly just as the word says, but fly with my imagination and be capable to came out with a feeling, honest and complex, and transpose it into a message.

The movie express a culture, a feeling and most of all, the power of will.In a way or another, the secret of the movies is that - get a feeling and use the cinematographic language to make reality of it. Ang Lee could do it in a way that nobody did before. Because he did it in his own way.The movie is not about fighting, is not about China. The movie is about people, and what's around their beliefs and wishes.The best on Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is the essence of it.

CTHD: A Spritiual Journey,"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon is one of the finest piece of art ,giving us insight into ancient Chinese spirituality;no doubt it is one of the best motion pictures of the century.Crouching Tiger and Hidden Dragon symbolically reflect two different forms of energies within a man. The story revolves around the young princess filled with incredible energy and an obsession to lead an adventurous life of a warrior. This energy is manifested in form of lust,violence,rebellion and theft..which is crouching Tiger. Hidden Dragon reflects the energy within which is discovered under guidance of an enlightened master.This reflects to the spiritual freedom one gains after overcoming lust,violence & rebellion.

Chow Yun Fat is an aging warrior who seems to be going through a mid-life crisis. He loves Michelle Yeoh, but can't get around to telling her, and is attracted to Zhang.  The unanswered question posed by Zhang is, ""Did you want me or my sword?""

NOT a hollywood feature film. All the comments about the ""laughable stunts"" are ignorant, in that those are a needed part of the genre.And to say Bruce Lee or Jackie Chan would have done it better is laughable. Chow played the role of a hero. NOT a braggard. He was reserved and knew he had the power to destroy, but needed to refrain in order to make things better for all. That never works, so he had to do his best to contain the needed violence.The acting was really good for a kung fu flick, but that's not what I expect from them.

A serious martial arts film I have not seen for a long time,"I envy anyone who has not seen a Chinese martial arts film (wuxia pian) before seeing CTHD because of the joy and novelty which await him/her.  A martial arts film is different from a kungfu film in that the former is a historical romance and fantasy in which the protagonists usually use fantastic weapons and make out-of-the-world kungfu moves.  They can ""fly"", make opponents stand still by ""striking their vital points"", use any object as a sword, just to name a few.  Anyone who is interested to learn more can read John Minford's translation of Louis Cha's martial arts novel ""Deer and the Cauldron"" published by OUP.Like musical films such as Top Hat and Singin' in the Rain, serious martial arts films are few and far between these days.  I am glad that Ang Lee has made such a film to critical acclaim and hope that it will revive the genre in Hong Kong.  As a film buff and a Hong Kong Chinese who has been reading/seeing martial arts novels/films since 1970, I rate the film 8 out of 10 taking into account the costume design, action choreography, photography, acting, film score and other martial arts film elements old and new (e.g. sword fighting in a bamboo forest and tree tops has appeared previously in King Hu's film Touch of Zen).By the way, I just got the Region 3 DVD today for repeated viewing in my home theater.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Breathtaking.,"Before I saw the film, I saw an interview with director Ang Lee.  In the interview, he talked about how he wanted all of the fight scenes, and especially the one in the trees, to be real--instead of computer generated--because computers couldn't duplicate the effects of wind on individual leaves and the gentle sway of the trees.  From that comment I knew I would love the film, and I wasn't disappointed in the theater.  The flashback seemed a little out of place, but overall I think it helped the emotional impact.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who is patient enough to read the subtitles, which in my opinion add to the mysterious quality of the movie more than any dubbing will ever do.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Gorgeous, terrific movie-making.","It starts quietly enough. A swordsman returns to the woman he secretly loves, to tell her he's decided to give up the life of a warrior. As a token, he gives her his signature weapon, the Green Destiny sword, and asks her to deliver it to the governor in Beijing. Simple enough.This kicks off ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" one of the most beautiful, passionate action/adventure movies ever made. Much has been made of the wu xia fight choreography, and many, sadly, have expressed their dislike for it as unbelievable. It's not supposed to be believable. It's supposed to be admired for its balletic artistry, its refusal to let the emotions of conflict remain stubbornly earthbound. The action choreography in this film is, like all true martial arts, both thrilling and meditative.Most filmmakers working with this material would have gone overboard on the action. Ang Lee, however, is too good with actors and stories to make that mistake. He anchors ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" on its superb cast-- Chow Yun-Fat(how could it have been anyone else?) as the aging warrior Li Mu Bai, Michelle Yeoh, her face aglow with wary beauty, as Shu Lien, and the astonishing Zhang Ziyi as Jen, the new governor's daughter who is much more than she originally appears.

Not just a Kung Fu Movie...But an Exceptional Film,"I would like to start by clearing up one misconception about CTHD:THIS IS NOT A KUNG FU MOVIE!!Yes, the movie has episodes of kung fu in it, but it doesn't necessarily make it a kung fu movie.  The kung fu serves as a generator to the movie, a backdrop.  Comparing this movie to the movies of Jackie Chan and Jet Li as I have read in some of the comments is absolutely ridiculous.  Those movies aren't even in the same class as this movie.  One user wrote that Yun-Fat Chow shouldn't have even been casted in this movie because he isn't a Martial Arts expert. Well, that goes to show you, that this movie isn't just about martial arts, this movie has much more substance than just fight scenes.  I am sure if it was intended as Kung Fu movie Jet Li would have probably been cast, and I am sure Ang Lee would have not directed it, and this would have been a totally different film, a kung fu film.  Yun-Fat Chow was casted in this movie because he is an exceptional actor as is Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang.If you go to the theater thinking you are going to see only a kung fu movie, you will be seriously disappointed and you are misinformed.  If you go see this movie for poetic dialogue, incredible cinematography, a moving score, superb acting, a subtle yet undeniable love story, and yes, incredible fight scenes that are in place, then you will enjoy CTHD.In regard to all the negative comments about the ""flying people"" as some of you have put it.  This isn't anymore ridiculous than say James Bond jumping out of a plane without a parachute and surviving somehow or Arnold gunning down 30 men armed with automatic weapons with two hand guns. This is the movies, not real life, if I wanted a dose of reality I would hang out on the street corner and watch life unfold in front of me.  This movie is a fantasy set in an ancient time, fantasy movies shouldn't only occur in the future. We go to the movies to be dazzled, amazed, astonished, enlighten and moved. These are the qualities that I found CTHD to contain.  Definitely, one of my all time favorites. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

the dubbed version,"This comment is directed specifically at the dubbed version of the film.

I'm used to the horrifying dubbing in Hongkong action pics, after all. Well, let me say that this movie is a million miles away from any other dubbed flick I've ever endured. It is clear from the beginning that the dubbing was accomplished with a great deal of time and care in order to capture the poetry of the original script while seeking to better fit the actors' mouths. Also, Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat have beautiful voices and dubbed their lines in the prevailing mood of each scene. I appreciate the kind of work that went into making the dubbed version the equal of the subtitled version--I'm not kidding! I've watched both versions and any way you see it this movie is a perfect gem. I must admit that I'm swayed by other factors in placing CTHD high among my all-time favorites: I love kung fu movies, wirework ""chi,"" period pieces, Michelle Yeoh, Chow Yun-Fat, Ang Lee, ""girl power,"" and cool-looking weapons.

Most people miss the boat.,"To indicate what a master of deception Lee is - most people think this film is about a green sword and its theft.  They also believe the film belongs in the genre of ""Kung Fu"" or martial arts movies.Personally, I think we are wrong on both accounts.  Lee has created an epic film with his usual sensitve, gentle style that is really about deception, illusion and he informs us that our eyes cannot be trusted as faithful interpreters of reality.Lee implies much in his film while saying actually very little.  The dialogue is extremely efficient and the characters are generally warm, sincere and very easy to identify with.  It is really a film about finding ones destiny, the impossibility of capturing the past, and in many ways the limitations of cinema in spawning the imagination of the viewer.  We are constrained by our previous knowledge of film and Lee takes this prejudice and both laughs at us for it, and loving uses it to create strong emotional scenes (such as the later ""ballet among the trees"").It is an extremely important existential film with multiple layers of depth. One can see within the work of Ang Lee the influences of Bergman, Hitchcock, Truffaut, Fellini, Welles - all the masters, and he takes no shame in ""borrowing"" from them, and yet his own style characterized by an uncommon gentleness and contrast is so powerful that by referencing the masters, Lee (rightfully so), establishes his own chair among the pantheon.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Those puffs of dust when they hit each other only looked stupid!

A Sword Play,"""Two master warriors (Chow Yun-Fat and Michelle Yeoh) are faced with their greatest challenge when the treasured 'Green Destiny' sword is stolen.

As each warrior battles for justice, they come face to face with their worst enemy - and the inescapable enduring power of love.""Set against 19th-century China's breathtaking landscape, 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is the action-packed box office smash from acclaimed director Ang Lee, featuring stunning martial arts choreography by Yuen Wo Ping,"" according to the DVD sleeve description.

A visually stunning and emotionally gripping masterpiece.,"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is one of my all-time favorite films. I've seen it three times, and every time I've been equally captivated from start to finish. It's an epic story set against stunning Chinese landscapes, but what truly makes this film unique are its action scenes. Ang Lee and choreographer (I can't recall his name) have created a masterful symbiosis of martial arts, character conflicts, and emotions. The supernatural moves the characters perform during the fights add to the story's mystique and magic.The plot is engaging and easy to follow, revolving around an unbreakable sword at the center of the characters' frustrations and desires. It also explores multiple love stories, all of them tragic. Themes of love, freedom, honor, and revenge run deeply throughout the film. The acting is phenomenal, with Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi delivering standout performances. That said, all the characters and their relationships feel authentic and emotionally resonant.Visually, the film is breathtaking, with beautiful scenes across various Chinese landscapes. If you love China, this film will certainly draw you in. The action sequences are spectacular, especially the fight between Michelle Yeoh and Zhang Ziyi. Each fight is distinct, and none feel repetitive. The music, featuring solos from renowned cellist Yo-Yo Ma, complements the film perfectly.The ending is tragic yet fitting, reflecting the film's themes and the characters' journeys. The only downside might be for viewers sensitive to violence, but personally, I wouldn't change a single thing. This is a 10/10 film, and I highly recommend it to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
over the top (not just literally),"Well, as one who grew up watching the traditional kung-fu movies, especially the Jackie Chan and Jet Li series of movies, I am very accustomed to well-choreographed yet extravagant scenes, especially. But this, well it was more than over the top. In a serious film, the choreography does not fit into the film at all. It seems to parody all those great kung-fu classics, and would be more suited to a film that does. And before you ask, I felt the same thing in the Matrix. The stunts unfortunately detracts one's attention too much from the story. People leave the theatre talking of the stunts and not of the story, which is a real shame. The plot could have been slightly better executed, and with a better put together screenplay, where the story flowed a bit more, it certainly could be classified as an all-time classic. But overall, this has to be the best kung-fu movie since the Bruce Lees. And thoroughly deserves the Oscar nominations...",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A film much more than mere martial arts!,The pacing of the dialogue scenes are reminiscence of Anh Hung Tran (Cyclo). The martial arts scenes was nothing short of jaw-dropping spectacular...the best I've ever seen.

Good film,"Good film. This Film should have got more Oscar's and it should be recognised than this rating in my opinion. The action and choreography in this film is pure class and in my opinion on pure poetry when it really kicks off, making use of just more than just swords. So the Action is in this. The Romance and love and that one of the character's that is not declared until the final moment's is just heartbreaking and it makes me cry every time. You just feel for the character involved as you know they are just falling in love for each other but they do not share their feelings til the last moment. So the Romance is in this. The Location's involved in this film made me actually made make go on a trip to China purely so I could go and visit them as they were so beautiful8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderful!!!,"This is a kind of movie I wish I could see every time I go to a movie. A movie that you love and you don't have to find reasons why. You devote yourself completely to the movie and when it ends you simply want more of it.The basis for the film is a love story(actually 2 love stories),which run simultaneously in the film,but the way the story is been told, is simply superb. Ang Lee takes his time and tells the story slowly. He pulls us in to the story and make us care for every thing that happens in the film. In his way from A to B he is not afraid to show long scenes that serve the movie well, or some fight scenes which defies the laws of gravity and yet remain true to the nature of the film.The film is beautifully shot and well acted,and it's a shame that none of the actors involved has got any Oscar nomination.Let's hope the Academy will give this film the recognition it deserve.The film is a rare thing.It leaves you breathless and the word wonderful (repeated more than once) is a word that describe it well and yet not enough to explain why.

A Film Without a Beginning,"I've seen this move over five times and each time I feel the same. Its biggest flaw (in fact, in fact) is that it has no beginning. It is assumed that a story must have a beginning, a development and a result. Well, here is the beginning. At first, the film has the feeling that something is missing. After seeing it, he discovered that the film one is adapted to the fourth book of a pentalogy, so we do not have the information of the first textbooks. While it is compensated with the part that gives information in the dialogues that leads us to imagine what has happened between the characters before, it is still partly with that feeling that something is missing.Otherwise, wonderful. Great performances by the entire cast; beautiful photography; big fights, both with weapons and without them; a dream recreation of ancient China; an adequate and versatile soundtrack, which works perfectly in both action and dramatic scenes; a couple of love stories not very original but very worn; and an agile direction of Ang Lee, which takes us from one place to another without giving us a break.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great movie,"I find it amazing that some people thought this movie (1) is noteworthy only for the scenery, (2) has little or no character development, (3) has no central plot, and (4) the fighting didn't make them feel life-threatened. If you think (1) is true, you must have been sleeping through the whole movie.  If you think (2) is true, you must be incapable of guessing what another person is thinking or feeling other than from outright verbal expression or from obvious acts involving explosives, knives, guns, or condoms. If you think (3) is true, you either slept/talked through the movie or you are not accustomed to movies with more than 1 story line. If you think (4) is true, you are right but so what?  The point wasn't for gore. Sorry that the women in the movie were portrayed as good fighters ... maybe you can write a letter to the producer and asked that he include 300 lb men yielding axes chopping each others limbs off. Request research be done on the types of damage an axe can do to a human body so the producer can competently plan the scene to give it the life-threatening, realistic feeling that you crave.The fighting scenes are not that much out of the norm from HongKong TV series and movies that feature fighting set in a time similiar to this movie. And in common with many of those movies that I like, ""Wo Hu Zang Long"" has multiple subplots and is based on a book series. This movie is definitely not overrated especially so when compared to the miserable movies produced by the big studios in 2000.This movie scores a 10 for entertainment value. The overall rating should be between 9.25 and 9.5.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
True magic,"I don't know where to start. Should I begin by telling you about the beauty and sadness of the story? Or by describing what went through my head while watching? Impossible. Should I analyze and interpret the details or the movie on the whole? Or should I make a statement about the absolute poetry and love that has been put into every single frame of the film? Maybe then can I explain how this movie moved me, touched me and raised a storm in my head  and became the best movie (all categories) I have ever seen, after 6 years finally pushing `Heat' down the ladder to a venerable second. I want to savor this moment. I almost want to resist. But how can one resist `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'?Set in China some time in the middle ages, two warriors, Yu Shu Lien and Li Mu Bai (Yeoh and Yun-Fat) battle an elusive enemy called the `Jade Fox' and are surprised to almost meet their match in a disciple, led astray and onto the wrong path by the Jade Fox (the Anakin-Skywalker-syndrome). The adventure revolves much around a sword that the Master warrior Li Mu Bai gives away as a gift, after deciding to give his warrior life up. But before he can give it up completely, he must face his Master's nemesis. The film is filled with stunning scenery and photography, violent and riveting martial art, a dialogue so poetic and justified it made my head spin. Refreshing and wondrous in the art of storytelling, `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' has made a profound impression on me.I am relatively new to the Hong Kong movies, and movies where martial arts play a considerable role. Therefore, I don't know how far Lee and his crew has pushed the ideas and the filming  but to me, this film was so deeply compelling and spellbinding, I have a hard time imagining anything like it. It's not a `martial arts movie'  it's much more of a drama, a love story and a retelling of Chinese lore. Magic is the essence, the aerial ballet of the fight scenes and the absolute control over every move in close combat, trigger and inspire a sense of wonder and adds beauty to the art of killing that Li Mu Bai is tired of. I understand that Ang Lee must have borrowed a great deal of material from Hong Kong movies, but like I said, to someone unfamiliar with those, this film appears quite revolutionary. There's poetry in every single detail: the story, the dialogue, the characters and their every trait, the scenery, the camera work and, of course, the fighting  violent and almost feverish. Colors, sound, the language, the trees, the desert and the warrior code. It all nailed me to seat and kept me on the edge of it until the very end. This is the kind of experience I so often want but seldom get. When the awkward position I had doubts that I could take for 2 hrs has been completely forgotten, then there's something great afoot.I say if the film feels absolutely spotless, if there are no flaws that appear on the first viewing (be it goofs or serious flaws in the storytelling), then the makers have achieved something extraordinary. Those films are few and far between. `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is of that special brand that not only appears flawless, but entirely perfect. I'm not saying that it is perfect  I'm saying that the depth and scope of the film makes it seem so. And that is not something that happens very often, not to me anyway. I think the last one must have been `Heat' or maybe `Se7en'. Before that...who knows.A clearer case of 10 out of 10 I have yet to see.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not too bad, but definitely overrated","I have been a fan of HK movies since I was really young.  I basically grew up with HK movies.  So, I couldn't pass up on a chance to see this movie that everyone was talking about.Don't get me wrong.  The story was great.  The music was really beautiful. But Oscar?  Come on!  I saw many other HK movies with the same or better quality/ plot, etc and they never got any nomination.  Why?  Because no one actually pays attention to HK movie until very recently.  And all of the sudden, people see this movie and go ""Oh WOW!""If you are a true fan of a HK movie, you'll probably feel the same way as I do.  Many HK movies are really beautiful.  OK.  This one is also beautiful. Although I have to say that the flying sequences were a little bit too fake. NO I am not saying that ""People can't fly'.  If you are a fan of HK movies, you are probably used to people flying all over the places.  It's not just this movie, most of the movies that has something to do with ancient Chinese Kung Fu has people flying (or do a lot of other  ""impossible"" things.)  But the problem is, I saw better movie where the flying sequence makes me more comfortable.  I mean, this one, especially the part where Chow flew down the waterfall... just really reminds me of how Superman makes his landing.What I am saying is, this movie is not so bad. But I saw better movies and they never got any nominations.  Don't get me wrong.  Story was good. Music was great.  Some action sequence was annoying because they look fake.  I like the movie.

the definition of a film,"Funny, how the best film to grace American screens in the year 2000, isn't even American, but a 12 million dollar export from Taiwan, that is quite possibly the greatest film to grace any screen in a long, long time.  In a sentence, that's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  The plot is simple, lacking the stresses of modern ""civilization"" (if that's what you call it.) Instead, it lets you lose yourself in China, at a mystical time when the world was full of innocence and superstition, and, you know, beauty.Sure, it should be noted that this isn't an all out, ""bucks for blood"" action flick.  It has action, yes, but it has a lot more:  romance, comedy, intelligence, and true magnificent beauty.  So, there is no Anti-humanoid getting shot hundreds of times and making it to the end credits, crack pushers, or bad DUBBING.  No, it's a film that relies on it's great characters to move the story along.  These characters are strong, complex, and brillantly played by (here's a little ironic twist) by Oscar snubbed actors:  Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, and Zhang Ziyi.What this film lacks is bad acting, though it makes up (and then some) with a mastery of visual technique and mesmurizing music.  The landscape carries you from all ends of China.  The choreographed fight sequences of Yuen Wo Ping will leave you breathless and completely amazed.  Once you add the camera work to this blend of visual technique, you have some extraordinary eye candy.  Tan Dun's music is both haunting and beautiful, complimenting the actions on the screen...enough so, as to say that this film could still amazed without dialogue.  It has the magic that those early nitrate films exsorbing with every frame.Okay, this film may have some exaggerated moments.  Isn't that why we choose to go to see films in the first place?

Best movie of the year! One thing to make it better..,"CTHD is my favorite movie this year. I think you can see other comments to know how great this movie is, so I just want to comment on something that can make it better, at least I think...I am a big fan of chinses kung-fu fictions (or wuxia novels). The kung-fu world in wuxia novels are fantasy that I grew up with. People in this fictional world can leap hundred feet effortlessly, if they have a good ""Light-Kung"" (one kind of kung-fu that you can channel your internal strength, or ""chi"", to your feet and make you jump much higher than common people). Most critics call it ""gravity-defying ability"". Anyway, light-kung is something that you have to take it for granted when you read a wuxia novel. However, people don't just fly. You gotta bounce on something. Worrior with high-level light-kung can even bounce on a twig or water. When Jen leap over water for hundred feet, I took it for granted. But when Chou Yun-Fat raised his right hand and did a superman style flying in the bamboo forest and other scene, me and my friend both yelled ""that's impossible"". I guess most die-hard wuxia novel fans will feel the same because there is no kung-fu that can make people fly. It's a rule, period.Chou Yun-Fat did several ""fly"" in this movie and it looks so ""made-up"". But I guess I'm too hard on him. I just saw a review from Ebert. He asked Ang Lee if computer trickery was used and the actors were not really 40 feet in the air holding onto the bamboo tree. The truth is that Chou Yun-Fat was really hung in the air, with his wife 40 feet down on the ground crossing her fingers. For that, I have to say he did a really good job.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

No hype .... A Great Entertainment,"It's frightening and denigrating !No, I don't mean the Ang Lee's piece de resistance: `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' which is a moving banquet for a resounding majority of the IMDB membership and the movie-going public in general.  What I mean is the frightening diatribes and the denigrating tirades that were leveled at the film by a tiny minority who seem to be proud of wearing their prejudice smugly on their sleeves.And  no, I don't just mean the ignorant few who dislike the movie because they apparently have 'reasonable' gripes such as:(a) I cannot stand moving my head up and down, reading subtitles while watching the movie(b) I chuckle with derision at the ridiculous 'flying' and stylized fighting, and I cannot relate, not having read a Marvel comicbook in my lifeNote: Many of us chuckled in the movie too, but only with exuberant delight at the flair and audacity that Ang Lee chose to stylishly stage the action.(c) the female fighting prowess in the movie is grossly exaggerated - ptui ! I can take them on with one hand tied behind my back(d) ) I find the movie so boring because the movie's cultural context overwhelmed me(e) I abhor that martial art movie because Jet Li/Jackie Chan/Bruce Lee is not in it . how dare Ang Lee redefines chop-sockies(f) I abhor that action/adventure/romance movie because only Lucas/Speilberg/Coppola can direct such successfully and only Hank/Ford/Willis can make it sparkle . how dare Ang Lee upstage HollywoodI can go on, ad nauseum .. but you all know what I mean. Petty tripes for reasons, as these whiners moan and groan about being robbed of their 7 measly dollars and having 2 of their precious hours stolen from their lives. Nevertheless, they are entitled to their own opinions and prejudice.  The more frightening and denigrating hosers are those whose sensibilities seemed to have been bitterly shattered by the hypes bestowed upon the movie and whose senses have been savagely benumbed by the 9.0 score accorded to the movie, so far, by the IMdb membership. ` How dare they hype the movie and commit the sacrilege of voting CTHD into the sacred sanctum of great celluloid classics like Godfather, Shawshank, Casablanca, Schindler's, Kane !'  they ranted and raged, spouting vitriol and lambasting the rest of us. It never occurs to them, that we are the same people who voted those great classics into the upper echelon of the IMDB Top 250.So, my advice to them is to stop playing God and just let the IMDB crowd cast their votes honestly without prejudice and machination from you. Please refrain from cajoling us with such machiavellian crap: ""CTHD doesn't deserve a 9.0, so cast a 1 to bring it down to a 5 which it only deserve"" or stupid nonsense like this.Fellow voters,  don't be seduced by the hypes and don't be manipulated by the venoms. If CTHD is destined to become a classic, so be it and if it falls from grace and is relegated to being a trendy flash like 'Fifth Element', let it be. Be honest, be true, be yourself .. just vote your heart as we are supposed to do.And don't be influenced by me, either.No hype: `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' is great entertainment.

A sweeping martial arts epic!,"I had heard so much about Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" that I practically refused to see it. Fortunately, I finally came to my senses. ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" is a wonderful film! This movie is most-often associated with its spectacular battle scenes, and I would be lying if I said that they were anything less than magnificent. Yuen Wo-Ping, choreographer of the martial arts sequences for this film and ""The Matrix,"" out-does himself in terms of creativity with his work here. I personally felt that the fight in the trees toward the end of the film was one of the films many highlights. The intensity of the duel between Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh) and Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang) was absolutely captivating. The fights would be pointless though, if not for the powerful story that holds the film together. A master swordsman named Li Mu Bai (Yun Fat Chow) must recover a stolen sword with the help of his longtime comrade, Yu Shu Lien. They soon discover that the thief is not quite who they thought it was, which makes recovering the sword much more difficult and dangerous than either of them could have imagined. The story seems very basic, but it really isn't. The performances do much to bring it all to life. The grace of Michelle Yeoh is daunting enough, but when she unsheathes her sword, the word, ""daunting"" is redefined. The very young and very beautiful Ziyi Zhang gives a very passionate performance as Jen Yu. Pei-pei Cheng provides the film with the deadly Jade Fox. Yun Chow Fat plays a very reserved master swordsman, anchoring emotional performances from everyone else.

Had I never heard of it before, I'd rate it a solid 11.  As it is, with the amount of buzz this movie got, if any movie wanted to live up to it, it'd have to have been personally directed by God.Secondly, since I know lots of people consider this a big deal, this review is based on the English dub.  The ONLY reason I didn't rent the subtitled version is because of my sister.  She refuses to watch anything subtitled. I pity her.On to the actual review.Wow.This is the kind of romantic high fantasy they don't have the guts to make anymore.  Magical swords, exotic empires, desert bandits, ancient secrets, fierce rivalries, and secret identities.  Mountains that dissolve into mist. Forests like green oceans.  Caves that transform into underground cities.Oh yes; in this world, humans can fly.  People can fly and that is that.  If you can't take that, go watch something like ""Sweet November"".This movie is gorgeous.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A brilliant Epic!,"Wow, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is in one word 'Amazing.' Surely due for a few nods from the Academy Awards, this film is nothing less than extraordinary.Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is above all a story of love. First of two aging fighters, Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat) and Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh), who are courageous warriors yet cannot seem to push their feelings toward each other out into the open. Next, it tells of the love between Jen Yu (Ziyi Zhang), a brilliant martial artist who happens to be the daugther of a governor, and Lo (Chen Chang) a desert bandit who is filled with ambition but who focuses his talents on robbing the wealthy. Lastly, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is about the needfullness of Jade Fox (Pei-pei Cheng) to pass her traits of brilliance in fighting for all the wrong things onto Jen Yu using stolen secrets of ancient masters.Filled with photography to rival that of some of the finest 'big production' movies ever made and action sequences that bring the art of eastern kung-fu films to our screens in the US like no other film before it, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon doesn't seem to miss a beat throughout its entirety.I recommend Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon to pretty much anyone, whether you see it for the beauty of great film art, its story of love, or the surreal action scenes you will leave it feeling fulfilled. I only have one regret as far as this film in the fact that the same choreographer shares their name on the credits as the choreographer of The Matrix. Don't get me wrong, The Matrix was a decent movie, but if Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was released before The Matrix there may not be anything mistaken between classic kung-fu conventions and borrowed action sequences.To sum up this film, I hope that Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon can add to the bridge for us in the U.S. who are given mediocre 'blockbusters' because we haven't, as a majority, tasted real cinema except in a few rare instances, since the 70s.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Very Strange Movie,"Not strange in a bad way, mind you - strange in that it defies classification.  I went into the movie expecting more of a standard over-the-top kung fu flick that legions of comic book dorks would go see and congratulate themselves for seeing a subtitled movie, much as they did for seeing something ""deep"" like ""The Matrix"" a couple years back.I was pleasantly surprised to find a more complex story and richer characters than I was expecting.  Not exactly a film that scholars will be discussing and writing about for years - but there's certainly more going on here than the simple good-vs.-evil clothesline of ""The Matrix"" or ""Star Wars.""My only real problem - the action was difficult to follow during one key fight scene, and the much-discussed treetop fight simply looked ludicrous and unbelievable.  That aside, an excellent film, very entertaining and very much worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

a perfect movie?,"i went in to this movie, expecting to be stimulated by the martial arts and/or pulled in by the plot.  i got neither one.  this movie put me to sleep and i have a hard time believing that everyone else thought it was incredible.  it put me to sleep.  the plot could not have been simpler about a girl who wanted adventure so she steals a sword and runs away.  the flashback sequence was incredibly slow and boring.  people just kind of jump from one roof to the next without any explanation or any indication that this is not the way things usually work.  the ending could not have been any less fulfilling.  in the end, as opposed to sucked in or stimulated, i was just going, ""wha...?""  all in all, i was very disappointed.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

You can read plot outlines and ""critics"" reviews elsewhere...I'm just a guy who loves movies.  I go at least twice a week (also saw Vertical Limit this afternoon...not so hot), and tend to see films on both ends of the spectrum.  This one is easily a ten.  Visually stunning (both the landscapes and the martial arts are things that I have never, in 22 years of film-going, seen.  Ever.), the film simply isn't content to rest on that...it delivers a powerful film full of truly fine performances, chief among them Chow Yun Fat's and Michelle Yeoh's.

What a great movie,"One of the few movies over the past few years where I have gone to the theater twice to see the same movie.  The fighting is great, and probably where it gets its appeal in the US.  The music is perfectly tuned to the events in the movie, haunting music for the slower scenes, more upbeat for fight sequences.  The acting and plot were both first rate.If you have never seen this movie before, watch it with the subtitles.  I listened to only a bit of the english dubbed version and found it to be not so good.  It doesn't take much more of your brain to read the subtitles, and I believe it adds a lot to the movie.

Somewhat Over-Hyped,"Over 41% of reviewers here at IMDb have rated this movie as a perfect 10. Either they're all wrong, or I am.It was OK, but I didn't think it was anything to write home about. Some intertwined love stories, a lot of martial arts type fight scenes and alliances that were difficult to keep track of. That's what I found, in this movie about the theft of a legendary prized sword. The story wasn't uninteresting, but I just found too many flights into fantasy as we watched people soar through the air and walk on water or treetops. This even detracted from the martial arts scenes, as too much of it just seemed unbelievable. There were good special affects, and some of the photography was brilliant, but the movie itself just didn't capture me the way I thought it would from everything I had seen and heard about it.Too each his own, I guess. I can only muster a 5/10 for this.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I am at a loss to explain the negative comments.,"Having read so many negative comments, all I can think is that the writers are immature and impatient (like Jen).  They do not like films that challenge their intelligence.  Oh well, it is their loss.For me, Crouching Tiger is a total experience.  I plunge into a clear lake in a foreign land and come up reborn.  Every time I see this film I love it more.Those who say the acting is bad, simply don't understand the convention of restraint that is part of the Chinese acting tradition. In fact, the subtle and almost secret exchange of feelings is so intense, it makes me think conventional acting techniques are too explicit.In the end, to each his own.  I am just grateful to Ang Lee that he made Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon for me to savor for the rest of my life.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"very good, but still chop socky","I suppose I am suffering from over-inflated expectations--I am disappointed because I consider Crouching Tiger (or is it Crouching Dragon?) only the second best film I've seen this year (let's here it for Wonder Boys!).  With all the hype I expected something better than a real good chop socky film.As a huge fan of Jackie Chan, I have long been frustrated with the conventions of the Hong Kong cinema, namely that the script need not make sense, the direction can plod except for action scenes, and the main character must have the same first name as the actor playing him.  Finally here is a script for a Hong Kong film that features interesting characters behaving rationally.  Michelle Yeoh is marvelous, and Chow Yun fat seems much more at ease here than in his English language pictures.But--I've seen cheaply make chop socky films where characters seemingly flew, and it looked silly.  Here, they use state of the art effects and . .. it still looks silly.  It's better, but it's still just a wee but over the top.  The cinematography is luscious, and the score is a masterpiece, and this is a really good movie--just not the best film of the year. Sorry.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Perfect in so many ways,"There is a multitude of ways in which this film is everything that one could want in a movie: Great action, moving love stories, great heroes (that are realistic and have flaws), empowered women that aren't merely sidekicks or ""ornaments,"" AMAZING music (this soundtrack is right up there with Alexander Nevsky as far as I'm concerned), fantastic cinematography, great costumes, effects, and it even has a good bit of humor thrown in the mix as well.I've heard many people describe this as ""Sense & Sensibility"" with martial arts...while that is obviously an oversimplification, it is kind of a fun unofficial tagline to entice people with.  For those that have classified the movie as ""unrealistic"" my only answer is: YES, it is unrealistic...its a movie, and a fantasy movie at that...so its okay that some of the characters can fly.I don't want to get into some huge plot dissection, so I won't...I'll just say that I've never seen a film take on some many dimensions (comedy, romance, action, etc) and have it work so well...sure others have tried this, but usually with disastrous results!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

He did so many innovations for the Wu-Xia Movie Genre which has been very important for several generations in Taiwan, China, and HK. The beauty of the movement goes in unison with the fine story. However, a viewer has to be a Chinese speaker to be able to understand the poor accent the actors have.

A true poem,"Up to now i wasn't much attracted to martial arts movies. When I first saw the trailer of ""Wo hu zang long"" on tv i thought that it was going to be just an interesting movie and nothing more. How wrong I was. Before i begin my commenting of the movie I'd like to say that describing this movie as a kung-fu film would be a truly great injustice.The story line is quite complicated partly because it involves the lives of many characters and until the end of the movie you keep asking yourself if you understood everything or missed something from the plot. I won't describe it here partly because it would spoil the fun of future viewers and partly because it would take too much time and space. In my opinion the great quality of this movie are its characters. If you watch it closely you'll notice that although it deals a lot in a fantastic environment the characters are very realistic. There are no ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"". Everyone makes mistakes and everyone is in a  particular position because of his/her past and experience. i believe that all the actors do their best and the result is more than satisfying.The other strong point of this movie is the relationships between the characters. Love, hate, friendship, abandonment and rejection continually change places and mark the lives of all the heroes. It could be a love story but as it often happens in real life true love is most of the times hidden and silent. This movie also treats death as a form of catharsis and redemption, the way most great tragedies do.You may have noticed that I haven't mentioned the fight scenes. I thought so. I won't say anything about them because i believe that people should see this movie for the movie and not for the fx.Someone said that if this was a Hollywood movie everyone would be ranting against it. I would like to add that if this was a Hollywood movie : firstly it would have won the Oscar and secondly it wouldn't have captured the true eastern philosophy. It would turn out to be another martial-arts-great-sfx-but-no-meaning movie and i think that ""Wo hu zang long"" is a lot more that that. And personally i like when movies like this never win in the Oscars because quality and emotions can never be measured with prizes. Just see the movie and learn to respect your emotions.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Boring, Really Boring","I do not see the appeal of this movie.  The story is more suited for a child's book than a feature film.  Great for bedtime stories, as it would bore them to sleep in a jiffy.The fight scenes are ridiculous.  Jumping, flying and kicking like a poorly choreographed ballet (a ballet for lumbering cattle).  I would like to have seen a real martial arts master like Bruce Li walk in and really kick their slow, clumsy butts.  Heck, my 16 year old kid could kick their butts.The ""flying"" is really dumb.  The ""actors"" legs dangle in the air like in a amateur presentation of Peter Pan.  Just don't expect the acting to be on par with the average high school presentation.I saw this on a long flight and considered walking out, but the 6 mile drop dissuaded me.  Come to think of it, Crouching Tiger made the flight seem longer.2/10  The scenery is good.  The rest of the movie isn't.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the greatest films I've ever seen,"oh my god. I went to see ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" last night, and I was totally blown away. I have been wanting to see this film for some time, I'm so happy I got to see it. I'm especially happy because I saw it on the big screen. Believe me, if you have any desire to see it, see it in a theartre.The film has so many great things going for it. The acting, the story, the love, and how could I forget the action.The acting is very good. Chow Yun Fat delivers a superb performance. I was especially impressed with Rachel Yeoh's performance, she was great. But the biggest surprise for me was that of the young actress who played Jen. She should be a big star in the future.The story is very good. I'm not going into plot details because I'm sure if you're reading this than you know what the plot is. But the story is well put together and shot.The two love stories in the film are very well executed. The unspoken romance betwwen Chow Yun Fat and Rachel Yeoh was very interesting to watch. But the one between Jen and Lo was touching. The scenes in the desert are pretty funny.Now of course how can you talk about the film without talking about the action. The action is so well done I wanted to cry,(not really). The fight scenes are always spectacular. There are I would say five or six big fights in this film. Each one of them is different and interesting. The fight scenes go from them flying around each other and climbing walls like Spider Man, or two woman using countless numbers of weapons, (they all keep breaking). I have been to thousands of movies. And I've never seen an audience stand up and applaud the film in the middle of the scene, they did after the first chase/fight scene.I went with my friend who couldn't quite grasp the fact that this is a fantasy. He liked it but he thought some of the flying got rediculous. But I don't care, it was always awesome. The film has my vote for Best Pic at the Oscars. First it was Gladiator, then Traffic, but I'm sticking to this film. This film is a magical expierince, a must see. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's an adolescent with massive potential but no direction who ultimately finds herself after causing a horrible tragedy. She just happens to know Kung Fu instead of basketball, football or some other theme that we've seen a million times.Yeah, the special effects were awesome.

Yes, it is a love story fantasy movie first, martial-arts movie second. While the story is a bit simplistic, it is grand and powerful.

wise and true,"With regards to two gripes about the film (the flying, and the lack of relationship between the 2 main characters) i have some comments. if you have didn't like CTHD because of the above two reasons, read on!First of all, it just bothers me that you weren't able to accept the fact taht people can just fly in this movie. It's a part of the literary genre, and even the whole discipline of kung fu is to achieve an enlightened state so one can levitate and defy gravity. So i think the story is totally logical. But even if you didn't know that, which i didn't before my friends informed me, i don't understand why one cannot accept the movie. It's clearly a fantasy, a myth, very much like matrix. And movies, what movies are supposed to do is provide an escape not only from our world, but also from the very physical rules that govern it. Seeing people leaping towards buildings shouldn't be any more startling than seeing James bond dive from a plane, a technician disarming a bomb, or a middle aged man trying to seduce his daughter's cheerleader girlfriend. It's the movies!And also, with regards to your ""lack of passion between the leads,"" I'm surprised you would make such a statement if you had liked ""the Ice storm"" Clearly the leads cared for each other in their facial expressions, the tone of voice with which they communicated, but they DID NOT show unrestrained passion like the younger lovers did. Obviously, this was set up in a ""sense and sensibility"" kind of way. Some will even argue that they had passion but it's suppressed because of their oath to her late fiance. I believe that there is not so much passion between them, but that doesn't mean there love is any less valuable, deserving or beautiful. They are more like soulmates on an emotional level, and their love was something great to behold-Just like the movie itself.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

East meets West,"I have to say that the Oscar nominations (and the 4 actual awards) that 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' recieved really made me to take a special interest in the film. It really was astonishing to see a Chinese film to recieve 10 nominations from the people who usually take no chances with their selection of movies. Now, after seeing the film, I feel a bit disappointed but I also understand why Ang Lee's film pleased the Oscar committee. It is truly an entertaining film which combines a very typical 'American' storyline with the long traditions of Chinese filmmaking to create a perfect mix for audiences on both sides of the Pacific. Lee cleverly disguises the classic American film stereotypes (the pair of professionals who hide their feelings and the rebellious teen and her 'wild one' lover) by setting the story to a fairytale-like China and giving the protagonists some fabulous physical abilities, thus giving something new for the Asian audiences to watch out for while the Westeners can admire the spectacular landscapes and breathtaking fight sequences and enjoy the film as pure entertainment.

As if that's a proof of a bad movie. Well, those very same people probably will also fall asleep on Bach, Beethoven, or Mozart.  Or do they even know what Bach, Beethoven, or Mozart are? By the way,  Beethoven is not the movie about a big, dumb dog.Finally, those people kept comparing this movie to Bruce Lee or Jackie Chen are simply idiots. Same with those people found the ""flying"" sequence ""ridiculous"", it only tells me that you have no appreciation for the Asian (or perhaps any other) cultures. Why did you even bother to watch the movie in the first place then waste our time to read your ignorant comments?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Nice scenery, but thats about it","I was rather excited about this film from all the hype, but after seeing it I was rather disappointed.The film started off well, I was truly interested in seeing how Chow yun Fat's character resolves his personal issues and how all the other characters develop. But then the story seems to throw abunch of random crap and then a couple quality scenes into the film, then weakly resolve all of the characters troubles.The story was the only part of the film that really bothered me, it started off well, but then the writer half assed the second part of the film.Well I will say that I didn't want my money back after the film, but in no way should this movie be a best film nomination. I personally gave this film a 6 and I am rather confused how it ever got a 8.9 rating. well have a good one.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Oh My God...,"The best film of the year, hands down.  I was completely enchanted by this beautiful, moving, exciting motion picture.  The actors were wonderful, the script was elegant and simple, and the martial arts scenes were breathtaking!  I cannot give this movie enough praise, it was just SO good.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What a breathtaking film! It's absolutely BEAUTIFUL!,"I saw the movie a few weeks ago and decided to see it for the second time at the theater. I don't remember when was the last time I did that for a movie. But waiting for the DVD release is just too long a wait. And it turned to be even better than the first time! There are so many exquisite details of the film can only be enjoyed without worrying about reading the subtitles. And the fight sequences are just as breathtaking as the first time. They always started out with a slow steady drum beat then doubled the speed and just getting faster and faster, then stopped at the climax on a loud accent beat! Like a piece of visual music, it's brilliant! The images of the two swordsmen in white soared into a sea of green bamboo forest at the end of the movie is an instant classic in movie history.I've never expected everyone would have a unanimous feeling about this movie. Like any other movies, there will be always people who love this movie and those who just don't get it. But it puzzles me to see the number of people showed such a hostility (and just plain nasty attitude) towards such an artistic achievement. I have no doubt that only time will prove it: 15 or 20 years from now, this movie will still be remembered, but NOT the rest of this year's Best Picture Nominees. That's the difference between a timeless classic and a short lived sensational.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
