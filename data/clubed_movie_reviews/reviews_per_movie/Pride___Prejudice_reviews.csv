There's a lot to like but the film has one distinct disadvantage.,"Back in 1995, the definitive version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" was brought out--and everyone I know who saw that one agrees with me that it is simply the best. Much of it is the acting (having Colin Firth as Darcy isn't bad) but the biggest reason to adore the made for TV version is that it's long--very, very long. This allows the story to unfold slowly and is never rushed. Unfortunately, every movie version I've seen is just too rushed--and it's hard to shove this wonderful story into a two-hour time slot. So, no matter how good the 2005 movie is (and it's quite good), it cannot hope to equal the mini-series. It's a shame, actually, as there's so much to like about this Keira Knightly version. The music is great, the locations top-notch and the Bennett girls actually look their proper ages! For example, in the 1940 MGM version, the actual ages of the actresses was their mid-20s to almost 40! And, the Bennetts are supposed to be teenagers (there about)!My advice is go ahead and watch this 2005 film--it's really very lovely. But then do yourself a favor--find the 1995 version. You'll be thankful, believe me.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Handsomely filmed adaptation of a beautiful book!,"The book by the wonderful Jane Austen is definitely better than the film, dealing with the consequences of love, and the social differences of the late 18th century. The film is certainly handsome looking, with some truly beautiful locations and costumes, with a nice script and some excellent performances from Keira Knightly as Lizzie and in particular Judi Dench as Lady Catherine. Donald Sutherland (yeah, you saw right) was quite charming as Mr Bennett if you put his awkward accent aside. I liked Matthew MacFadyen as Mr Darcy, with his handsome looks and all that, but I will say I do prefer Colin Firth's interpretation from the sublime 1995 mini-series, Firth seemed to adopt a more likable and sympathetic approach to the character. I liked the way the film dealt with the period look and the social differences, and while there was a lot of the pride I would have liked to have seen a little more of the prejudice. If anything, the film could have done with being twenty minutes longer, as I felt there wasn't quite enough content from the book. Then again, it's been a long time since I read it, so I could be wrong. Overall, a beautiful film, not quite as good as the 1995 film Sense and Sensibility with Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson, but worth watching for the detail that obviously took a lot of effort to get right. 8.5/10 Bethany Cox.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
brilliance took two decades to arrive,"before i start, i would like to say this. i can read, have read the book, and i read the title of the movie before watching, as should you all. quite disappointed in all the pompous idiots filled with prejudice about the movie.I know that another version of the well-mined Jane Austen classic would need to be brilliant indeed. Such diverse and beautifully written characters and such a delightful plot, so deeply rooted in a profound understanding of human nature, are timelessly attractive to directors, actors and audiences alike. So give them a break. you couldn't do any better.Lets start with Mr Darcy. Darcys embodied by Olivier, Firth and now Matthew McFadyen bring differently significance to enjoy in the proud and socially awkward leading male role. Where Olivier and Firth gave us an aloof, arrogant Darcy encased rigidly in a shell so impenetrable it was almost impossible to believe he had been moved by Lizzie's sardonic criticisms or attracted by her spirited independence, McFadyen shows a more accessible Darcy. He's vulnerable, even fragile behind his stiff manners. His aloofness is more believably from social inadequacy than arrogance, yet he is believably constrained by his social standing to regard decorum, fortune and propriety in a wife's family as significant in his choice of a bride. His capitulation to Lizzie is therefore more believable.Similarly Garson, Ehle and Keira Knightley illustrate the lively intelligence, sharp-minded wit and wry humour of Elizabeth Bennet in equally shining ways that nevertheless bring out different aspects of the character. Keira Knightly's performance as Elizabeth Bennett is by far her best, as she sparkles in this role.The two have a chemistry that i had yet to see on the big or small screen - one that mirrors real life romances. the dislike on both accounts is obvious, watching it grow to love was beautiful and stunning. the love story is heart-felt and sweetly, deeply affecting to a level that modern romantic comedies rarely achieve. I found this movie to be a a richly photographed, memorable ensemble production in which the romance is predominant over the drama but does not eclipse it. though my one disappointment - the ending?! of course i wanted to see them kiss, who didn't? but the shots of them arguing in the rain, and as they draw close with the sunlight shining between them was breathtaking.Giving due significance to the rural environment which plays such an important part in the story, the cinematography captures wide frames of soft, misty fields, copses and winding country roads as an environment which underscores the gentle manners and passionately beating hearts beneath empire gowns and ruffled shirts. The surroundings both detract from the humans and function as appropriately natural settings for the dramas of human nature.Keira Knightley's swan-like Elizabeth moves with energy and grace, hotly opinionated and profoundly moved by principles and prejudices, and magnetically drawn by the seeming arrogance, reticence and gallant behaviour, finally revealed, of Mr Darcy. For two centuries Elizabeth Bennet has been a heroine much admired for her self-contained independence within a culture more conditioned to female submissiveness. Knightley's portrayal is true to the original.All in all, i must give this movie 5 stars, 10 out of 10, 100 % brilliance. The story itself, the characters, the actors, everything that was in the movie 'bewitched me body and soul'. i have never been more moved by a movie, especially not one where i found it to be as hilarious as it was moving.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Jane Austen for ever,"Jane Austen's tale of love and economics reaches us once more with the energy of a thorough novelty. ""Pride and Prejudice"" has been a favorite novel of mine since I first read it and I've seen Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson, Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and now Matthew MacFadyen and Kiera Knightly. Amazingly enough I've never been disappointed. The material seems to be full proof. Colin Firth's Darcy, in many ways, is the Darcy I've always imagined. He's been an actor I've followed feverishly since his glorious Adrian LeDuc in ""Apartment Zero"", Matthew MacFadyen was totally new to me but he managed to create that sense of longing that makes that final pay off so satisfying. Kiera Knightly is a ravishing revelation. I must confess, I didn't remotely imagined that she was capable of the powerful range she brilliantly shows here. The other big surprise is Joe Wright, the director, in his feature film debut which is more than promising, it's extraordinary. The photography, the art direction and the spectacular supporting cast, in particular Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn, makes this new version of a perennial classic a memorable evening at the movies",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Spirited Modern Interpretation of Austen's Classic Love Story,"A ""modernised"" version of Jane Austen's classic novel that should not be compared unfavourably with 1940 Hollywood Olivier / Garson version nor several BBC serials culminating in the most acclaimed TV series version from 1995 with Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle-a personal favourite.This 2005 film clocks in 127 minutes (UK / Europe)& 135 minutes (USA & Canada) -the extended version allowing audiences to share more of the timeless love story with the main characters -Elizabeth Bennet & Mr Darcy.Director Joe Wright plus his screenwriters ( Oscar winner Emma Thompson contributed to the final screenplay) have chosen to emphasise Elizabeth Bennet / Mr Darcy plus Jane Bennet/ Mr Bingley story lines & reduce Mr Wickman, Charlotte & Mr Collins to supporting characters.Austen's famous wit,satire & humour that forms the basis for her enduring appeal (Pride & Prejudice was finally published in 1813 & continues as an annual bestseller)is sidelined to open up this version as more emotional drama for modern audiences.If you are open to a newer interpretation, can avoid comparisons to the nearly 5 hour 1995 TV version which allowed for greater depth & detail in telling all the characters story lines & accept some of the new film's rushed story lines-you are in for a treat .....New British star Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Bennet))excels in her first real leading actress role ably supported by fellow Brit Rosamund Pike (Jane Bennet) as the sisters supportive of each other's & their Bennett family problems.Knightley at 20 is the right age for her character,this allows Elizabeth's girlish personality plus her character's pride, misjudgements & loving nature to shine through....Great star turns from Brenda Blethyn as their mother Mrs Bennet plus Oscar winner Judi Dench as fearsome Lady De Bourgh (Mr Darcy's aunt)add depth to this film version.Claudie Blakley as Elizabeths's wise friend Charlotte Lucas & Simon Wood's amusing Mr Bingley are delightful supporting performers.One major surprise is Canadian actor Donald Sutherland's touching performance as Mr Bennet -capturing both the humour of living in an all female household & five daughters to look after with the poignancy of seeing his eldest children's difficult relationships develop -easily his best acting performance in years.In the difficult role of Mr Darcy rising British star Matthew Macfadyen (BBC's Spy series Spooks & Award winning New Zealand film ""In My Father's Den"" rises to the occasion.With the short running time, there is not enough time to allow Darcy's repressed & prejudiced personality to be fully represented -Macfadyen perfectly displays Darcy's social & class problems, his unfortunate attempts at gaining Eliabeth Bennet's interest & his painful adjustments to achieve their personal love story.Macfayden & Knightley's objectionable first dance,their embarrassingly moving Collins House meeting,the unexpected Pemberley encounter plus their two proposal scenes are highlights of this film.Engaging acting performances with wondrous film photography,film locations at some of United Kingdom's most famous stately homes, marvellous film sets & costumes plus one of 2005's best original music scores add greatly to this new film version.All in all one of the better films of 2005 -not perfect film making and not intended to be as subtle as Austen's novel -but a wonderful surprise with some changes to present a modern version of Pride & Prejudice for current audiences -do see this film as & when it is released worldwide....And after seeing the film or re-visiting 1995 BBC TV series -read the original novel for its classic storyline, memorable characters & Austen's brilliant writing style,wit & humour.....9 Out Of 10 for this different interpretation of an enduring classic",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Exquisitely filmed.,"Pride and Prejudice has always been one of my favourite books, so any screen incarnation has to live up to certain personal expectations of character, style etc. And of course, there is the gold standard of the 1995 BBC series, which, as other reviewers have pointed out, had the luxury of several episodes to cover a story that here takes just two hours. So I was truly delighted to enjoy this movie so much. It had a lot to live up to.The first thing I must say is that it is exquisitely photographed. The atmosphere set by the beautiful cinematography, is perfect. The film deserves to be nominated for an Oscar on that basis alone. I am in awe of the technical crew and director who could find such unspoiled vistas and such perfect weather in England, and I say that as a Brit who used to live very close to some of the eastern England locations! I sat right through to the end of the credits to see where it was shot, because I assumed it must have been filmed in some remote, rural, continental European locale. I felt quite ashamed that I had doubted the ability of my native land to still provide such delightful scenery! The mist rising off early morning fields, geese on a perfect farm pond, magnificent country estates and enormous trees more usually associated with California than England. Also perfect were the interiors. The air of genteel poverty in which the Bennets lived was well captured. The slightly down at heel scruffiness of the Bennet's farm and house, and the general dirtiness of 18th century life for most people, contrasted well with the ridiculous, rich fussiness of Lady Catherine de Bourg's house and the stark, museum-like beauty of Darcy's home.The cast were excellent. I thought Rosamunde Pike as Jane Bennet was perfect, Simon Woods as Mr Bingley was charming although perhaps a little too puppyish, I enjoyed Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn as Mr and Mrs Bennet and I'm one who thinks Matthew MacFadyen did a very good job as Mr Darcy, a characterization which was slightly more user-friendly than Colin Firth's 1995 Darcy. Also outstanding were Claudie Blakley as plain Charlotte Lucas, rescued from a life of unmarried oblivion by pompous Mr Collins (a very good Tom Hollander) and Kelly Reilly, as the bitchy Miss Bingley. Is Rupert Friend (Mr Wickham) destined to play Orlando Bloom's brother? Am I alone in seeing a similarity? Of course, Keira Knightley plays the title role of Elizabeth. I have followed her career closely since Bend it Like Beckham, and I thought this easily her best acting performance so far. She captured the playfulness and wit of Lizzie's bright mind wonderfully well, and made me think long and hard how truly frustrating it must have been to be an intelligent young woman in a world that expected nothing more of her than an ability to choose ribbon and to capture a husband possessed of money. The only possible slight criticism I might make, is that Keira Knightley is perhaps a little too waif-like to pull off the 18th century characterization entirely convincingly. She is stunningly beautiful, but her stick thin appearance alongside her more robust looking screen sisters, made her look as if Mr Bennet might well have doubted her parentage!",,Anonymous,Romance
A timeless adaptation of a timeless Jane Austen novel.,"The fantastic romantic world of Jane Austen again makes its way to the silver screen in Joe Wright's new adaptation of the classic novel Pride and Prejudice. It is the first feature film to be adapted from it in 65 years, and believe me when I say it does not disappoint. This adaptation is, for lack of a better word, a BRILLIANT achievement that keeps you actively involved from the first scene to the very last scene, just about consuming you with aching romance  and it is sprinkled with humour and intelligence.Still taking place in the late 1700s and still interweaving its story with timeless emotion, pride, narrow-mindedness and love, Pride and Prejudice (2005) zooms in on the Bennet household in class-conscious, stuck-up England. In this household, we follow five spirited sisters under the idealism of their overbearing mother (a superbly neurotic Brenda Blethlyn providing for the comic relief) who desperately wants them all to marry and thereby secure the future of the family estate. But the standout sister and protagonist in the film, Lizzie (Keira Knightley) is clever enough to have other ideas, but alas too romantic to carry them out... *sigh*When reviewing period films such as this one, one often focuses on the setting and costume design. I believe this is done because they are often better crafted than the actual story. But in Pride and Prejudice (2005), the stormy emotions of its charactersbottled up but bubbling to get outcompletely consume the entire film and places understated set designs in the backseat. Only when it was consciously put forward, like when Lizzie Bennet was admiring the beautiful architecture and Greek statues of Mr. Darcy's estate, did I ever notice the background  and it was, of course, extraordinary. A similar state displaying the dynamics of its central cast should be attributed to the grand dancing scene between Lizzie and Mr. Darcy  the two are so absorbing that when Wright purposely fades out the the rest of the dancing crowd, you do not notice a change. Your eyes are still solely Knightley and Macfadyen. It took me three viewings to realise this.As for acting performances then, the unspeakably lovely Keira Knightley has finally done it. She has proved me wrong with a truly Oscar-worthy performance and she does it without crying, worrying, moping and sighing like the other nominees that year. Knightley is in fact all about sweet subtlety here, bringing a fantastic presence to her high-spirited character Lizzie. She is the type of character that every girl and woman in the world can identify with and with Knightley behind her to give her oomph, you will not find a more likable creature in films this year. MacFayden is completely satisfactory as Lizzie's love interest Mr. Darcy, but he is no Colin Firth  lacking in charm and is a bit too wooden. But no matter, because these two have the best on-screen chemistry I have ever seen. I'm not kidding, this was sensational. Such magnetism. It is highlighted from scene 1, playfully touching upon their sexual tension and gradually turning it into feverish love that sends chills down your spine.Every last actor in the cast of Pride and Prejudice (2005) gets to shine in their characterfrom Dame Judi Dench as a cold rich lady to Donald Sutherland as caring Mr Bennet, all except Jena Malone whose all too Valley-girl American attitude was distracting and annoyingly anachronistic. But it is Knightley who is in focus and who propels the film with her warm charisma. It is impossible not to fall in love with the main characters, and I say this as someone who avoids romance-themed films and who does not care for period films.This is a truly timeless story and this film will hopefully be remembered, celebrated and praised for breathing life into it with such passion.10/10 (which is a rare grade for me)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The realism was unauthentic.,"I felt distracted by the 'realism' of the film. Jane Austen would not have gone into detail about the 'farm' (chickens, hogs, etc.) portrayed in the film. Jane Austen's world was a gentle one and the Bennets, despite their pretensions, were middle class. The television series got it right. This film did not. The new film deviated too far from the book and the author's intent in dealing with the manners of the aspiring middle class in the early nineteenth century. Although the costumes appeared to be authentic, the makeup was too heavy; the eyebrows on the women too sculptured and the men's beard too unshaven, as are characteristic in 2005. One good feature was the variety of clothing styles form the current (early 1800s) to the outdated of Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland. I remember David Maclean saying about the film Dr. Zhivago that they forgot about the hairstyles. Here they forgot about the makeup.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Outstanding...MacFadyen is a worthy Darcy.,"Outstanding ... MacFadyen is a worthy Darcy and a darned good actor to boot! The scenery, backgrounds, and country folk were much more realistic than previous versions. The costumes and hairdos also seemed in keeping with the times. Another great addition is the priceless Donald Sutherland who, in a perfect world, would have had more scenes with Judy Densch. If those two can't chew up the scenery, nobody can. And, finally, Keira Knightly is a jewel. Her beauty is so apparent that it almost detracts from the fact that this is a very good actress who can hold her own in any room. This was a delight and I only wish that it could have been 6 hours long.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Acting is superb,"While I will say first off, that no movie production ever made will ever equal a novel, especially one of this magnitude, this movie is very well done. I read many reviews going either way, but I must say I enjoyed the film very much. Many are quick to criticize Mac's performance saying he didn't do a good job. I thought he was fine, but believe me he is no Colin. Keira Knightley was absolutely incredible in the film, I would go as far to say it is her breakout performance. Donald Sutherland was amazing, but as can be expected from him. Judi, like always is incredible at her role as Lady Catherine.If you are a complete avid fan of the book as I am, you may or may not like it. My only complaint was that it was in fact short, but then again it is quite hard to make a 370+ page novel into a two hour movie easily. There is a phenomenal display of acting by the entire cast, and the score is perfect.One warning though, the movie concentrates on the love story more than Austen's satire of society, so many Austen fans may be angry with that. But overall I thought it was a great film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Gorgeously filmed, smartly compacted Austen","Pride and Prejudice (2005)I began my ""Pride and Prejudice"" attempt with the well regarded 1995 five hour classic with Colin Firth, a BBC mini-series. And it is so poorly filmed (visually) and so utterly about recreating the text (the Austen original), it ends up being awkward and sort of awful. As a movie.I know that is sacriledge to some. But I switched after an hour to this one, which I had seen before. And in two minutes I was sucked in. I think the biggest first point is this: to be true to Austen, you must find a way to put us there, to make us feel it. It's not about the text, the facts, the truth of the translation to film. It's about the effect and the final ""truth"" that this movie manages in a short two hours.So, yes, this is a filmic film. It's gorgeous and thoughtful for how it handles the scenes and the light, the movement of camera and the capturing of space. It's a wonderful film on a physical level. (There are particular scenes, in the middle especially at a party, where the camera follows the action from character to character through several rooms for a glorious long take that just fills the sensation of being there beautifully.)You might say this is Keira Knightly's movie, since she is Elizabeth. And she's kind of great (I've always had a reservation about her sincerity on screen). The cast around her is terrific--even the somewhat troublesome casting of Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy. I know that Mr Darcy is meant to be unpleasant, but he comes off as somewhat wooden for too long here...as he does in Colin Firth's hands, too, in fact.But I warm to him by the end, so maybe it's perfect. And the other cast, including stars like Sutherland and Dench, is great.The director, Joe Wright, is basically unknown to me, though I see he did the more excessive Knightley vehicle, ""Atonement."" So the tendancy for dramatic ambiance is a given, not to mention Anna Karenina (also starring Knightley). It all works. It's a kind of dramatization that purists probably hate, but for me it makes an original take on a classic that has its own dignity and beauty.And I'll add that Knightly is just 18 for this filming, and shows amazing depth for a young actress.Recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely Perfect 2 Hour Adaptation!,"For years I have waited for a Pride and Prejudice that perfectly captured the wit, the intelligence, the passion and the romance of Jane Austen's classic. The 1995 mini is fabulous, and I have watched it many times, but I have always been frustrated that while it got so much of the dialogue and the detail right, it somehow fell flat on some of the more subtle dynamics of the novel.Finally this movie adaption has captured what has before been missing! True, it took license regarding some of the verbiage and detail of the novel, but it ultimately completely captured the characters, their transformations, their strengths, their vulnerabilities and their passions. You simply cannot do a definitive work on Pride and Prejudice in two hours. And this film doesn't try. But what it does attempt--to capture the story and characters, it does beautifully. It is well acted, well directed and connects as the book connected. While it has to rush and skimp on scenes and characters, it is the most authentic and true to the spirit of the novel version that I have ever seen. You simply do not want it to end...Well done!!!! It was about time!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Three weddings and no funeral,"This quintessentially English film is utterly charming - a very traditional interpretation of Jane Austen's 1813 novel that manages to entertain, amuse and even move. First time director Joe Wright has worked with television playwright Deborah Moggach's script and a wonderful collection of mainly British actors to delight us. The versatile camera-work, luscious countryside, grand settings, period costumes, and atmospheric music are evidence of a work on which much love has been lavished.At the heart of this triumph is the delightful 20 year old Keira Knightley as the assured and sharp Elizabeth Bennett, the second of five daughters looking to be married off by an anxious mother. Knightley's rise in the thespian firmament has been meteoric and this is her best performance to date in a role for which she is perfectly cast. Matthew MacFadyen is suitably brooding and gauche as Mr Darcy, but the cast list is enlivened with splendid British character actors, including Brenda Blethyn as Lizzie's irascible mother, Tom Hollander as a diminutive cleric seeking a wife, and Judi Dench as the formidable Lady Catherine, plus the Canadian Donald Sutherland (Lizzie's wise father).This is a Georgian world in which social conventions present a veritable minefield for indiscretions or misunderstandings and in which a formal dance can be as intricate an occasion as international diplomacy. Pride and prejudice are only two of the obstacles to be overcome before inevitably true love brings Lizzie and her dark knight nose to nose (we don't even see a kiss). Passionate stuff indeed.",,Anonymous,Romance
Just classic!,"I've seen this movie, I wanna say, a million times.

What happened to Mr Darcy?,"The new ""Pride and Prejudice"" is pleasant enough, with stunning photography and locations, definitely a less polished adaptation than the BBC 1995 TV series. The action has been moved back about 20 years,to when Jane Auste started writing the book, rather than when it was published, so the costumes and period details are not the usual imagery we have of Jane Austen's work. The Bennet girls are presented as true country girls, with unkempt hair and modest clothing, and the house looks worn out and messy, chickens walking in the courtyard and everything. That has some charm, but, I'm afraid, there are more serious let-downs. First of all, they had to compress a rich book like ""Pride and Prejudice"" in two hours and that inevitably lead to cuts that didn't allow to sufficiently develop the many different characters. In particular Mr Wickham is a mere passing figure, while he has a much weightier role in the story. If your familiar with the plot it seems to run away at an alarming speed. Second: Mr Darcy. I went open minded, ready to give MacFadyen a chance, avoiding comparisons with Colin Firth. But there was nothing to save about him. He really is dreadful! Mr Darcy is supposed to be proud and arrogant, but MacFadyen looks flat and inexpressive for virtually the whole film. When he tries to show his caring and sensitive side, he then turns into this big puppy-eyed jelly of a man, devoid of all masculinity. Well, I'm sorry, but comparisons are unavoidable: Colin Firth did it a thousand times better! To be honest all the male figures are nothing more than caricatures of Austen's characters. Mr Bingly is exuberant, young and naive, but in this film he's transformed into a babbling idiot. Mr Collins is not bad, but not a patch on David Bamber's outstanding performance in the TV series. Even Donald Sutherland is not doing Mr Bennet the justice the character deserves, with an underplayed performance. The women fare much better. Brenda Bethlyn is perfectly adequate as Mrs Bennet and Dame Judy Dench is a tremendous Lady Catherine De Bourg. The Bennet sisters are as you would expect them, though Jane is a bit underdeveloped. But it is Keira Knightly who really shines. Her Lizzy Bennet is as good if not better than Jennyfer Ehle's. You really do feel for her, more than you do for the rest of the characters. Shame there is virtually no spark between her feisty Lizzy and the stone-faced Mr Darcy played by MacFadyen.In short: if you've not read the book nor seen the TV series, you'll enjoy this. If you've done one or both of the above, you will find flaws that might spoil the enjoyment.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Pride and Prejudice-Simply unmissable,"Pride and Prejudice was an absolutely fantastic film. A great cast, and Keira Knightly did an excellent job and Matthew Macfadyen was a wonderful in the role of Mr Darcy. The cinematography was so ridiculously good, there were some fantastic shots and the costumes were also fantastic. The script was fairly good, it is true to the classic by Jane Austen, Mr Wickam could have made more of an appearance, and had a striking resemblance to one Orlando Bloom.

A most diverting film!,"Having attended a regional charity premiere last night I can safely say that the actors chosen have more than succeeded in bringing their characters to life.

The whole cast throw themselves into their roles with gusto and overall the film left this viewer charmed and delighted. Its obviously going to have a tough time proving itself to those who loved the BBC adaptation as that seems to have become for so many THE adaptation of the novel, but give this one a chance, those that don't will be missing out.

"Wonderful Moments, Both Big and Small","There's really nothing negative to say about the film. The actors are perfectly cast, the direction is subtle and well-realized, and even a shade more cinematic than I would have expected, or than it needed to be. The moment, early in the film, when Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy are arguing while dancing, and as they look at each other, everyone else in the room disappears... emotional, cinematic, and brilliant. Soft little touches like this, throughout the film, make it work far better than some dry BBC version of any Jane Austen book.Yes yes, I'm male, and I enjoy a good car chase and explosion as much as the next guy. Tragically, there was none of that in this movie, but I'll get over it. Ladies, you'll want to watch this movie over and over. And guys, trust me: Even if this movie isn't your ""thing,"" if you take your date to this one, you're in good shape.Ten of Ten, and that's after I saw the Bollywood ""Bride and Prejudice"" not too long ago. That one was fun, but this version had the emotional impact, camera-work and staging that seemed to do Ms. Austen the most justice. Wonderful moments both big and small.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Juxtapositions,"I'm amazed at how many people think of books as being encompassed by their stories. When that story appears in a film relatively unaltered, purists rejoice.How silly. Stories are there as frames on which all the meaningful stuff is draped. Or so it would be after Jane Austen invented the novel. The way an idea appears has more effect than the idea itself, and so with images as well. Jane had two great inventions.The first was in building two parallel narratives: one of individuals bumping into each other and the other of grander forces of life and society. The two interact at times (and much is made of these turning points) but usually the two are layered one on top of the other, shifting dominance as they go.The other great invention was devising a narrative style that sometimes centered on the people and sometimes on their containing world, using the one to poke sly fun at the other.So converting Austen to film is a challenge, indeed, but only if you want to capture Austen's magic. Past P&P projects have used the Merchant and Ivory approach which just takes the people alone. There is a context, but it is there only to provide lushness and decoration, not fate. Not what would become known as noir.The challenge comes in how to handle the layers. We have already many ways of ""folding"" in films, but they mostly require structure in the story itself. How to introduce this notion of a second flowing layer without changing the story? Why you do it cinematically.And that's what we have here. I don't know this director, but he is from TeeVee so obviously is inexperienced in these matters. I credit the producers for specifying the technique.And we have it to glorious excess. Nearly every shot is structured with at least two layers, with things happening both in foreground and background. The opening scene introduces this to us, a wonderful sequence worthy of Welles, as we follow our girl down the road over a bridge behind laundry to the house. Then we leave her and enter the house and noodle around a bit, always still with layers, then wander to a window where we see her passing by behind the house.Any movie only has a few moments to introduce itself and tell you how the visual world will be constructed and this does it well. This layering is kept up throughout, with a tour de force in the ball, where a seemingly seamless eye goes all over the building, capturing glances at people we know and those we don't.It isn't that they do it and it is so effective. It is that it goes on so long, layers shifting and receding to be replaced by others in the scores. It is magnificent. The film is worth it for that one scene alone.Oh, the actors are appealing, as we expect. The story is simplified and softened, also as we expect.

PRIDE AND PREJUDICE...A Timeless Romantic Tale,"Keira Knightley brings magic to the screen from the first frame of the film as she reads a book and slowly walks back to the brick home of the Bennet family while ducks waddle about and clothes flap in the wind. Thus setting up the romantic location of the beautiful English country side and the magnificence of the great English homes which create a visual background for PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and in the development of all the characters which follow.The cast is really superb, with Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland in performances that cast the true essence of the Bennet mother and father and provide a strong contrast to the aristocracy represented by the always strong performance of Judy Dench.Matthew Macfadyen is a wonderful Mr. Darcy and the scenes with he and the lovely Keira Knightly build and build in the development of their romance with the scene between them in the rain under a colonnade truly one to remember and cherish.PRIDE AND PREJUDICE will stay with you forever, as the romance and the tale of the lovely Ms. Bennet and the handsome Mr. Darcy is timeless in its setting, dialog and romance.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
surprisingly enjoyable!,"It was with some trepidation that I went to see this film, believing that I would not enjoy it and that it would in no way compare to the book or the 1995 adaptation. However I floated out of the cinema! A lavish production with lots of giggles and I thought brilliant performances from Keira Knightley and Matthew McFadyen. The romance was believable, if somewhat 'rushed', having to squash lots of happenings into a 2 hour film, but I think I'll have to go and see this again. For a big screen production it works. However I suspect die hard Austen fans may object to the differences in the film to that of the book. But go and see it and judge for yourselves...",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Delightful and Beautiful Film,"In this adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel, Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth Bennett, a rebellious young woman who refuses to marry the wealthy man her mother (Brenda Blethyn) has picked for her, although it would save her family from poverty. Meanwhile, her four sisters deal with their own suitors, including the mysterious Mr. Darcy.I'll admit that I have never read the novel and period pieces don't really interest me so I wasn't expecting much from this movie. However, Pride and Prejudice is a solid film with an engaging romance and strong characters. The best part about the film is probably the cinematography. The whole film just looks fantastic and it has a very engaging hook to it that just please the eyes. Director Joe Wright does a good job behind the camera. He captures the romance nicely and he moves the film at a nice pace. Sometimes, the film moves slowly but the actors get it out of the rough patches.Out of the entire cast, I would say that Donald Sutherland gives the best performance. It seemed a little simple but it was still pretty nice. Keira Knightley also gives a good performance though I don't agree with her Oscar nomination. Her character is portrayed as a different girl and not one that giggles at everything. In the beginning of the film, Keira is too giggly and it didn't fit the character though she gets better as the film progresses. Rosamund Pike gives a good performance even if her character is a little dull. Jena Malone gives an annoying performance but it fits her character so I would say that she did a good job. Brenda Blethyn gives a funny performance as Elizabeth's mother and she has some memorable scenes with Donald Sutherland.Matthew Macfadyen also gives a strong performance and he has great chemistry with Keira. The two of them make a predictable story engaging at times thanks to their performances. There were a couple of things that I didn't like about the movie though. There were a few cheesy scenes that were kind of unnecessary. For example, at the end of the film when Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are kissing, there is this huge yellow sunset in the background and I felt that it was a little too much. Of course some things are just unavoidable in chick flicks. The screenplay is pretty good though I don't know how faithful it is compared to the book. The score is also pretty good and it's easy to tell why it got nominated for an Oscar. Most of the film is just top notch and it's defiantly a film for both girls and guys. In the end, this wonderful surprise is worth checking out. Rating 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Criminally underrated, amazing visuals.","Upon first consideration of this film, I had thought it was a wonderful adaptation of the book. It wasn't until I had gone deeper into the movie that I realized its significance, and how it is truly not talked about enough. The dialogue is both refreshing and quick. The directing is without a doubt superb. Additionally, Knightley and Macfayden do a wonderful job in their respective roles.Of the many improvements shown in relation between the book and the movie that stood out to me in particular would be the stronger character development. The film delves deeper into the characters' motivations and emotions, particularly Darcy and Elizabeth. Their complex relationship is explored with greater nuance, making their love story even more compelling. Of course, because the story is based upon one of the greatest pieces of classical literature ever written, its sharpness obviously shows in the film.What really made it for me is that the movie looks plainly amazing. The scope and cinematography were without a doubt overlooked in many respects. The filming locations are perceived and picked in perfect compliments.Truly a must watch

Enjoyed it's new perspective,"The movie is beautifully shot, the supporting cast does very well with the limited time they are on screen, and the leads are refreshingly young and passionate. Knightley is fiery and expressive; MacFadyen says so much with just a pause or a look. For those who have yet to see it, go in with an open mind and enjoy it.I've read some of the (many) harsh comments written about this movie, and quite frankly, I don't understand the need to bash what amounts to a rather good interpretation of JA's book. The Austen purists have come out in droves to nitpick on every aspect and to hail the 1995 miniseries as the definitive P&P adaptation.I loved the miniseries, and it gathers no dust in my DVD collection, but why be close-minded on a different view of JA's beloved characters? Does the new movie take liberties? Absolutely. With only 2 hours to fill, that is not surprising. However, I found it quite refreshing to see the characters in a new light. For example, Knightley as the youthful, not matronly, Lizzy made her sparkle, and more likely to rush to judgment. McFadyen's Darcy, played as shy and misunderstood, made me re-think the character. I'd forgotten he was only supposed to be about 28, quite young to be the lord of the manor. When I read the book, I saw him as stuffy and old. Even Firth played him as such, although he goes through a satisfying transformation by the mini-series' end.Let's all remember that the miniseries took it's share of liberties on the book as well, did it not? I do not recall reading about Mr. Darcy jumping in a pond and emerging in a state of undress. And fencing? These scenes were meant to flesh out his character and add some sensuality. I believe Joe Wright is doing the same...with the Pemberley statues (vs the paintings)...with the proposal in the rain vs. in the drawing room... I, for one, am happy to see one of my favorite books played out on-screen, with a new perspective. Who knows? It may entice a new generation of movie-goers to go to the library and check out a copy...",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Spectacular Film,"Although I rarely give out excellent scores for movies, Pride & Prejudice of 2005 seems to demand one. Whatever flaws do exist in the film aren't even noticeable, and once you're swept into the magic of the story the spell is not broken for one moment until the television is turned off.The true surprise of this movie, for me anyway, was Matthew MacFadyen's excellent portrayal of Fitzwilliam Darcy. I am a huge fan of Jane Austen's book, and Colin Firth's Darcy (although momentous in its own ways) never quite seemed to match the written account to me. MacFadyen triumphs in bringing out the vulnerability that feeds the shell of pride and his awkward shyness that lurks beyond his disdainful haughty brow. His hesitation when it comes to sharing his feelings with Lizzie Bennet are exactly what I pictured from the book: an almost boyful and youthful embarrassment paired with the desire and strength of a man. He truly shone.Keira Knightley was also superb. If you believed her career was stereotyped by her work in Pirates of the Carribbean, one glance at this film should prove you wrong. She has an incredible talent to play many different roles and to bring out many different moves. The happy, carefree Elizabeth that is by shades overcome with sorrow and regret is wonderfully brought to life by Knightley.The other actresses and actors in this movie are quite excellent, especially Simon Woods, whom I had not heard of before. Something that makes Pride & Prejudice a treat for the eye is the delightful filming, which whirls you throughout ballrooms and across entry halls and from conversation to conversation, dance to dance, without you even noticing that you aren't there yourself.The raw desire that makes the ending so satisfactory is something that is rarely found in a PG movie, but here it is pulled off with perfect decency just in the eyes of Darcy and Lizzie. I definitely suggest giving Pride & Prejudice a try.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Benny Hill version of P&P which should be called  'Shy and Miserable',"I really hated this - it is OK to modify scenes from the book, but to change the spirit of it completely is too much. And to change Jane Austen's witty dialogue for some of the dross, especially early on in the piece was definitely not an improvement.This loud, grubby group were not my idea of the Bennetts or their friends. The Bennetts may have been poor and may well have lived in a shabby house, but they had more class than this lot.As for the proposition that Darcy's aloofness was because he shy and not confident, he just seemed pathetic to me and Darcy should certainly not be pathetic.Except for the scene where he gave a lovely smile - Mathew MacFadyen wore the same expression pretty much throughout, (which was not surprising as this Darcy was such a boring character), and Kiera Knightly just seemed much to flighty for Lizzy, she seemed more like Lydia.To me - it is the Benny Hill version of P&P - no subtlety, little wit, almost just slapstick.Thank God for the BBC.",,Anonymous,Romance
Romanticized version with some odd inaccuracies,"Director Joe Wright seems to enjoy creating adaptations of classic novels that are modernized in jarring ways. His 2005 version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is no different. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet, one of the most beloved heroines of English literature, is sharp-witted and feisty, but her hairstyles, costumes and overall presentation-she never wears gloves and rarely a hat or bonnet, both being standard attire for a woman of her class while out in public-are just wrong. Lizzie wears the ugliest, shabbiest dresses in most scenes, including olive drab, brown and gray gowns that appear to made of sack cloth. The Bennets are minor rural gentry and somewhat cash-strapped compared to Messrs Darcy and Bingley, but their home, Longbourne, is presented as a raucous farm, with hogs running through the interior in one scene.I believe that modern viewers would be able to understand that young genteel ladies of that period would have dressed formally, not like today's more ""let it all hang out"" casual at all times. The men never wear hats. Caroline Bingley is shown at a ball in a shockingly skimpy gown with spaghetti straps. I don't think any lady in Austen's time wore anything like that-indeed, I'm not sure dressmakers even knew how to make a dress like that at the time. Again, these are small details that are nonetheless jarring.Still, this version of Pride and Prejudice does introduce young, modern viewers who have not read Austen or any classic literature to a world and values that may be quite alien to them. Unlike other reviewers, I think Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen have good chemistry, although in the earlier scenes of the film, they are both quite unpleasant! But true love finds a way. The cinematography and musical score are beautiful and enhance the movie to a great degree.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Evoking a deep sense,"It's been many years since the sight of romantic longing filled the screen with such intense passion and allure, evoking a deep sense of longing and desire within the viewers. The portrayal of love and yearning has not been as captivating in cinema for an extensive period, making this particular display exceptionally remarkable in the realm of romantic films. The depiction of emotions and the portrayal of relationships between characters have rarely been as compelling and emotionally charged as in this production, setting a new standard for the representation of love on screen. This film's visual presentation of romantic longing is truly remarkable, igniting a fire in the audience's hearts and leaving a lasting imprint on their memories. The chemistry between the characters and the raw, unfiltered display of emotions elevate this portrayal of romantic longing to a level that has seldom been achieved in recent cinematic history. Overall, the portrayal of romantic longing in this film stands out as a shining example of how powerful and captivating such emotions can be when skillfully brought to life on the screen, creating an unforgettable viewing experience for all who witness it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I can't stop watching it,"I just can't stop watching it. It's as if I've been taken back to this time period and just don't want to leave it. What's amazing about the relationship between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett is, I believe, how honest they are with one another. They're conversations have everything they need to have in order to get to the heart of what Jane Austen intended and absolutely nothing that they don't need. It has probably the best dialogue in the world. This film couldn't have been done more perfectly. A big part of that is in the cinematography. It is incredibly beautiful and far different from anything I've seen before. For example, when we see Mr. Darcy in the mirror when he drops off the letter as if we are looking directly through the eyes of Elizabeth. Not to mention the breathtaking landscapes. There are hundreds more examples, but I can't possibly describe them as well as the movie can show them to you. I've never read the book, but after being so captivated by this film, I don't see how I can possibly avoid it now. I went out and bought it today. Everything about this movie is enchanting and refreshing. The truth in how they judge each other from the start, and then the honesty in how they confront each other about it. Keira Knightly brings an elegance to the character of Elizabeth along with her down to Earth manner of living and approaching people. Matthew Macfadyen is simply sublime. He doesn't even need the lines; just his facial expressions get the whole meaning across. Whenever I watch this, every scene he's in, I cannot help but stare at him the entire time, or else I feel like I'm missing something important. I hate just blinking when he's in a scene. I could go on and on about Donald Sutherland and everyone else as well, but all I basically want to say is that this film had the absolutely, hands-down, brilliant, most perfect cast that could ever have been conceived. The story line is what we might think of as being too simple. ""We"" being the spoiled audience of today who have had our heads filled with explosions and bullshit dramatic sequences. But in fact, the beauty of it is in the way Austen brings out the deeper meaning of every single seemingly insignificant event. It is a must see for all the decent, intelligent people left in the world.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Arguably the best version of an often-filmed favorite,"I had heard the controversy about the non-canonical ending, so I went in fully prepared to hate this version.It's wonderful.It's note-perfect throughout. It's hard to see how the casting could be improved: Jane and Mrs Bennett were perfect; Knightley was surprisingly good (who suspected that she could pull off the role of Elizabeth Bennett?); and Sutherland was born to play Mr. Bennett. The interiors, set decoration, and costumes looked perfect; the dances were astonishing - and the outdoor scenes were everything they should be. (There's a credit for ""digital effects"" - I presume that was what helped the landscapes look so good.) Poor Mr.Darcy has an impossible job following Firth's definitive performance, but he succeeds in bringing a very credible interpretation to the role.All in all, I found this to be a MUCH better version than the reviews would suggest. A pleasant surprise.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
THIS is the one that will best remembered & revered,"Complaints in some reviews here are mystifying, except for those with obvious pretentions to elitism. The chemistry between the the leads is unparalleled in the other iterations of P&P. This is magic. Brilliant. Unlike Olivier, Macfayden has the skill of subtlety and reserve. This is not a 'modern' version, it is a far superior version, depicting nuance, romance, complexity, instead of oddly idealized previous versions of simplistic flat caracitures. Stunningly perfect performances, directing and writing.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent - Great Fun Throughout,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, much more than I thought I was going to. I'm not a huge fan of period drama but love historical films in general so wanted to give it a go.I haven't read the book (have too many I want to read as it is)and have not seen the TV version so I am considering this as a film in its own right, not as an adaptation.The acting was brilliant from nearly all concerned (particularly Keira Knightley and Donald Sutherland) and the film keeps a good pace (slow, dragging stories are usually my concern in this type of film).The one let down could maybe be one of the sisters (sorry, can't remember name) who was incredibly annoying - but she may be meant to be that way.Cinematography was also stunning.

excellent film,"After a good friend handed me Pride and Prejudice in eighth grade and implored me to read it, I have re-entered the world of the Bennet's each year wondering when a movie was going to be made that could capture Austen's characters I knew so well from the book. I was a bit skeptical at first due to some of the casting but I am glad to say I was very wrong in my prejudice. I wish I could tell the director himself how much I enjoyed his interpretation of this outstanding story. It was witty, breath taking, and the acting was so realistic you cannot help but be drawn in to the story. Matthew McFadyen did an outstanding job showing the complexities of Mr. Darcy's character while Keira Knightley brought out the independent and clever subtleties of Elizabeth Bennet. The ensemble of actors, screenwriters, set designers, and all others who worked on this film truly did a superior job. From a Jane Austen fan, this is a favorite brought to life on the screen.",,Anonymous,Romance
Good for what it is,"A well mounted adaptation of the Jane Austen novel, but a little too Hollywoodised with the entire cast picked for their looks rather than acting talents. It certainly looks nice and has a ring of authenticity to it, but why bother when the BBC miniseries exists and is so much more in-depth and heartfelt?",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A delightful watch,"I believe this is Keira Knightley's best film. She gives us a spirited rendering of Lizzie Bennett, the heart and soul of every scene. A charismatic performance that does not dim, no matter how often I watch this film.Joe Wright's direction is equally crucial to making this such a delightful watch.Of my three favourite scenes, two are Ms Knightley's work: the dance with Darcy when sparks fly; and the confrontation with Darcy when she rejects his proposal. Marvelous. The third is Mr Wright's: the passage of time as she rotates on a swing - the changing farmyard through the seasons is so lovingly created.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mixed feelings,"Although I've seen this new version twice, I still have to give the advantage to the Firth/Ehle version, and not just because the mini-series had more time to develop the characters. Yes, Keira Knightley is lovely, but she has a very modern look and isn't suited to play this character. She doesn't convey Elizabeth's maturity and intellectual strength, and MacFadyen as Darcy doesn't convey his painful stiffness and upperclass snobbery. Instead, MacFadyen acts more like a sullen and tortured Heathcliff. Romantic, yes--but not Darcy. This new version is much less true to the manners of the day, such as when Bingley visits Jane in her sickbed, Darcy just walks into the house and leaves a letter for Elizabeth, or Elizabeth wanders outside in her nightgown, barefoot. And why did they dress Keira in such unattractive costumes? Brown homespun? Elizabeth wasn't an adolescent tomboy, but that's the look they've given her. Finally, I had seen the film previously in Scotland, and was surprised that another ending has been tacked onto the American version--one that was again distinctly untrue to the book.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant movie with amazing performances!,"I absolutely enjoyed this movie to the point were I have it near by when I feel like I need to see a good period drama movie!!

Due to this movie I have now turned in to a hopeless romantic and a period drama fanatic!
If you liked this movie and you are invested in watching other period dramas I highly recommend ""Anne with an E (2017-) series"" , ""Persuasion (2007)"" and ""Sense and Sensibility (1995)"" and ""Outlander (2014- ) series"".",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"My comments are partisan, but with good reason.","I have read the book and seen the BBC version. I went expecting much what I got, but had not completely written it off.First things first. It is a difficult task to reduce the book to a two hour film; really it is. I shall return to this point later.Cast: Mrs Bennett was nowhere near as good as Alison Steadman's version, who was one of the two star performances of the BBC version. Steadman has been accused of being a caricature in the BBC version. Indeed, this is what Austin's book commands of Mrs Bennett.Second, the other star of the BBC version was Mr Collins. Enough said about the new Mr Collins the better. Surely, he isn't a man that a girl would wish to marry and he is annoying - but that is where it ends. It should go much further than this. He should be utterly repulsive, as he is in the BBC version.Third, Mr Bingley - drab and too silly. Forth, the sisters - not silly enough, just annoying. Lydia in particular, fails. Mary is better than the BBC version.In general I did not like Mr Bennett, but where this film does do better than the BBC version is the final scene between Mr Bennett and Elizabeth, which here is better-scripted and acted.Dudy Dench, good as she is, was not correctly cast I feel. Judy plays such roles well, but she is too famous to play such a small role well. When one sees such famous faces it takes a while to accept them to the film and stop seeing them as themselves. Judy does not have time to do this. So whilst the BBC's choice of actor could be improved upon, the script does not allow it.And it is the script that I have most issue with. It fails on every count. The director does a good job of condensing the story to a film script, but this film should not be, as the book is not, about Elizabeth and some Mr Darcy meeting and eventually falling in love after some initial Pride and Prejudice. It should create an atmosphere and tell a story of society in addition. It should be acute in human observation. It should be everything that this film is not. I am afraid that the criticism is a damning one. Many money-making films are filmed for that reason and succeed because they prey on the fickle emotions of their audience. This film should have done much more than that but did not, and, in my opinion, did not obviously try to.Kiera is perfectly good as Elizabeth given that I am generally no fan. On the other hand I am a fan of Matthew, but he fails somewhat as Darcy. I saw him as sexually in need and not proud enough. In fairness, none of his character's failings were his own but of the script (or lack thereof).Elizabeth was given no reason to hate Mr Darcy so much. Indeed, apart from one comment he made about her being ""tolerable"", he was clearly in love with her every time he appeared, and the only negative thing she heard about him was that he did not give a living to someone his father wished one for: hardly a reason to hate the man with the passion she apparently did.To conclude, I said earlier that it was a difficult task to reduce this to a film. All that I could ask myself as I sat and watched, was why? This film should not have been made. The only possible motive for its manufacture is surely one of finance, which irks me.If you have not seen the BBC version and, or, read the book, then you will likely enjoy this film to some extent; though perhaps not consider it a must-buy. If you have seen the BBC version, then by all means go and see this film, if only to re-establish your appreciation of the former.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hollywood trash,"This is a deeply dumbed-down version of Austen.Every hairstyle is wrong, the Bennett family look and behave like Californian hippies prone to spouting (very) occasional bits of Austen dialogue.I will give you one key indicator of how badly researched and produced this film is: at one point Lady Catherine de Burgh, one of the great snobs in English literature, is handed a cup of tea by a servant and says ""thank you""!The fact that the Bennetts live in the same house that the Herberts inhabited in The Draughtsman's Contract is a surreal touch for any Greenaway fan...",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
See it!,"I saw this at the Toronto Inter. Film Festival. At first I thought, ""why yet another Pride and Prejudice?"" But I quickly changed my mind. Yes, the 1995 version was wonderful, and yes, you can develop characters a lot more in a miniseries. Let it go and judge this on its own terms.This version is set earlier--1797. As the director explained, he thought the Empire dresses too ugly and justified the earlier date because that was the date of the first draft of P&P. So it looks a bit different--more realistic, if you ask me. The Bennetts live in a real estate, with pigs and mud around. Chatsworth, which Jane Austen visited, fills in for Pemberley. With the exception of the ball scenes and a scene in town, very little of the epic period piece is needed.Keira makes a wonderful Elizabeth. She is the right age to be vivacious and silly, and she does a great job. Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennett!! At first the idea seems preposterous, but once again, it turns out well. Sutherland somehow masks his accent and blends in perfectly. His eccentricity is just enough to show where Elizabeth gets her spirit.The director and Matthew MacFadyen confessed at the screening that neither had seen the earlier versions before they filmed this, which perhaps explains why this is so successful--they weren't intimidated and weren't tied to earlier interpretations.If you have any doubts, see this yourself. You won't be sorry.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful weave,"Pride and Prejudice is by far, one of the greatest love stories ever written. And far and away the most developed story Jane Austen wrote. This 2005 movie was wonderful and breathtaking. The script was fairly faithful, and the story line indeed faithful, but the portrayal of the characters was dramatized differently than those in Jane's book. With that said, this portrayal was beautiful and well worth the attention of Austen lovers every where.I give it a 9/10, removing one point only on the basis that it took liberties with the style Jane Austen portrayed in her book. Other than that, it was a magnificent!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
art film,"I just wanted to say that for those of you who weren't already aware, this version of Pride and Prejudice is mostly an art film. I went to see it expecting for them to focus on things like telling the story and using the witty dialouge to its utmost, and was shocked to discover that it wasn't about the story at all. The story is a backdrop in this case, used to give visual imagery to an art film. If you're going expecting something very different, hopefully this will help you not to be disappointed. There is no comparing this version of Pride and Prejudice to any other, because it is an entirely different creature. Actors cannot be compared to other actors because this version is going for an entirely different feel. Keira and Matthew are not even attempting to imitate Jennifer and Colin's performance. All comparison is moot. In this version you are not supposed to be able to become attached to the characters, be amazed by how witty the dialouge sounds, or be enchanted with the story. These all have a very rushed and glossed over feeling because the main thing here is the visual medium. It is an art film called Pride and Prejudice. All other resemblance to Jane Austen's book or previous adaptations is non existent. That being said Keira Knightly is beautiful and Mr. Collins painfully amusing and creepy. There is a lot of beautiful camera work and a lot of awkward moments. It's worth seeing to form your own opinion but be prepared for what to expect.",,Anonymous,Romance
"A for Effort, but that's not enough.","""Pride & Prejudice"" (2005), directed by Joe Wright, is an honest--but not very effective--attempt to bring Jane Austen's novel to the screen.The plot of the novel and the film boils down to the love/hate relationship between Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) and Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen). I thought MacFayden was adequate as Darcy, although possibly somewhat coarse in appearance and manners. (Darcy is a snob, but he should be portrayed as an elegant snob.)Keira Knightley obviously works hard at portraying Elizabeth Bennet. She's a fine actor, but she's very much a 21st Century woman, and I had trouble accepting her in this period piece.Unfortunately, I never caught any true chemistry between the two lead actors, and, without that, nothing else can really work well.Simon Woods was miscast and/or misdirected in his role as Mr. Bingley. Bingley may not have the strength of character that Darcy has, but he shouldn't be portrayed as a callow fool.All the other actors did a competent job, especially Rosamund Pike who was luminous as Jane Bennet (Elizabeth's older sister), and Kelly Reilly, as the very beautiful and vicious Caroline Bingley.The outdoor scenes were predictably colorful--what director can resist dogs, pigs, geese, chickens, ducks, and swans in a period film? However, I found these scenes--as well as the ball scenes--to be overly orchestrated and too meticulous.Finally, I can't see how any discussion of this film could suggest that it was overly sexual. I can't even understand why it was given a PG rating--I think G would have been more appropriate. There's one instance of male nudity, but the genitalia belong to a pig. There's one instance of female nudity, but the female portrayed is a statue. There are many reasons to see or not see ""Pride and Prejudice,"" but excessive sexuality shouldn't be among them.In summary, I think this movie represents a sincere attempt at the cinematic portrayal of a great work of fiction. I think the director didn't succeed in this attempt, but the film isn't a disaster, and it's worth seeing as long as you're not expecting a masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Overall, it's a good adaptation, even if it's not free of mistakes and problems.","I believe that ""Pride and Prejudice"" is one of the most transported English novels to film and television. I've seen more than one adaptation, and each one has its merits and problems (however, it's generally agreed that the 1995 miniseries is the most perfect and canonical). This film is not as good as I would like it to be, it has several problems, but it is quite acceptable and also has positive notes to retain.Here, the story we already know so well takes place in the final years of the 18th century. From what I saw, the director wanted to do this to avoid the fashion of the Regency period, which he doesn't like, and taking advantage of the fact that Austen wrote the early version of the book around this time. Well, I can say that I share the thoughts of the director, Joe Wright, when it comes to dresses from the Regency/First French Empire period. Aesthetically, they are much less interesting than the ""bridal cakes"" of the pre-French Revolution period, or the wide dresses that began to be worn in the Romantic period. The idea of these dresses, which greatly emphasize the woman's chest and then fall straight down like a nightgown, is in a way imitating what the Romans and Greeks were thought to wear. Even so, there are several errors in the way the characters were dressed, arranged, combed and characterized: basically, the director ignored everything that didn't suit him. That was a mistake.The film is reasonably short for the literary work it brings, but I think it couldn't be otherwise. For the rest, the narrative is decently done, and the adaptation made to the source material is quite conscientious and tries not to cut important things. What I didn't like was the way certain characters were developed: Elizabeth became a wild girl and much less contained than would be supposed in the novel, for example. The rest, however, is quite satisfactory.The film is full of great British actors: in addition to Keira Knightley, who manages well in the role of protagonist, we also have Rosamund Pike, Brenda Blethyn, Talulah Riley, Jena Malone and Judy Dench. Each did a fairly good job in the role assigned to them. We should also appreciate the work of Matthew MacFadyen, Donald Sutherland, Simon Woods and Tom Hollander. On a technical level, the film invests a lot in good sets, convincing and well-selected shooting locations and good props. The cinematography is also good and does an excellent job throughout the film, with enviable camera work and good colors and lighting. The film also has a good soundtrack.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Brilliant, loved every moment","I went to see this with with a degree of scepticism, and very fond memories of the TV series and Colin Firth as Mr Darcy. No need to worry, I do believe they met the challenge of every English female to have watched the TV series with ""that"" scene in it and maybe even surpassed it... it took my breath away.This version has been filmed with sensitivity and emotional insight, telling more with a glance here and a look there than a thousand words can say. Having said that the vocal ""sparring"" between Lizzie and Mr Darcy is both intelligent and witty. The whole picture house joined in with the journey, sighing, laughing and gasping in all the same places.I felt completely at home with all the characters, Keira is wonderful as Elizabeth, Mathew Macfadyen, tremendous as Darcy, Brenda Blethyn outstanding as Mrs Bennet, Donald Sutherland a joy to watch as always. Nobody disappoints in this ensemble and I spent the most uplifting 2 hours of my time for a very long while, and left feeling happy and content, with a tear in my eye and a spring in my step.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A wonderful adaptation of a great story,"I saw this film last weekend with some trepidation. As an English teacher and an ardent Jane Austen fan I didn't think anything would come close to equaling the BBC mini-series which starred Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. In my opinion this film surpasses it. Like the 1940 Laurence Olivier/Greer Garson adaptation this does not strictly adhere to the novel, but it captures the essence of what Austen's story is all about. But in this film, never more clearly is the class distinction between Darcy and Elizabeth shown. The Bennet's are meant to be poor but respectable; Longbourn (their home) is after all, a farm. Previous incarnations have shown the class distinction through the size of the respected homesThe Bennet's Longbourn estate is still grand to many of us, but indisputably small in comparison to Darcy's home of Pemberly (Lyme Park in the BBC series, Chatworth House here). In the fashions, the distinction of rank is also preserved and we feel that to 'catch' someone like Darcy or his friend Mr Bingley is a serious achievement. The acting is wonderful from Dame Judi Dench's nasty Lady Catherine to Tom Hollander's comedic Mr Collins. Keira Knightley again shines but many may be disappointed by Matthew MacFadyen's Mr Darcy simply because he isn't Colin Firth. I love Mr Firth coming out of the lake toobut MacFadyen's performance is sterling (all those who have seen him in the TV series Spooks will not be surprised by this); he is far more Austen's Mr Darcy than his predecessors. Previous interpretations, though excellent in themselves, have, I believe, corrupted the Darcy's true nature. Austen's Darcy is moody and shy, which makes him seem arrogant and rude to those who do not know him. There are some excellent scenes (that take some liberties from the book), such as one where Darcy helps his friend practice an important speech; these reveal the truth of who these characters really are. While some sub plots are glossed over (such is the fate of squeezing so much into 2 hours) the main elements of the story are conveyed convincingly. To me this film is a wonderful adaptation that encompasses the real essence of the novel. It has made pick up Miss Austen once again (I am on page 106!!) Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Magnifique,Sublime film de même du livre...Une histoire d'amour magique.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Some nice script touches and an original feel,"The story is so well known it seems superfluous to go over it again. If you haven't read and loved the book (one of the greats of English literature), shame on you. But knowing the story so well leaves the viewer at full liberty to pick as many holes in the film as we like. So here goes Keira Knightley I find captivating and infuriating by turns. At times her dark beauty eclipses everything else on screen - small wonder she's a huge star. But her jollyhockeysticks accent and gummy toothy ""isn't it FUN!"" smile drive me completely insane. However, overall she makes a pretty good Lizzie, and does the material  and herself  justice, carrying the film well enough.Matthew McFadyen's Darcy is more problematic. I've revised my former opinion that he's just a 'wet' Darcy: this isn't fair. But his delivery is all wrong, and really, it must be part direction, not just his fault. He's not really engaging with the material or with Lizzie. His clipped and rushed lines were almost comical, racing to churn them out, and when he asks Lizzie in his plumiest tone; ""did you have a good trip?"" I burst out laughing  it's ridiculous! - Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson's Brief Encounter all over again! Alsoas a good looking man the cinematographer and director ought to have been able to 'find' the latent beauty in him, and maximise it. But I think this happens only rarely: for example, during his rainy first proposal, when his face has the luminosity to show that he really cares about Lizzie, proud and foolish as he is. I wonder (not for the first time) whether he's not been hoist, as it were, by his own petrifying 'period' hairstyle and clothes. Granted his character is itself at first stiff and formal, but once he gets to know Lizzie better, he should change subtly, and he doesn't. You don't get to see how she's affected him, and in his snarling ripostes to Lizzie's playful thrusts, he seems to be in a perpetual and sometimes rather bad-tempered sulk.Casting and script alike reflect the charming/infuriating conflict. Wickham's chirping is bland, ineffective and not charming. Dame Judy seems to be the only actress of her age known to Hollywood: there are others, you know! I found Bingley  excellent in series 2 of ""Rome""  incomprehensible, sniggering and implausibly awkward, like a sort of Shakespearean buffoon. But I loved Brenda Blethyn's silly but nonetheless astute Mrs Bennett, and Claudie Blakley made a very appealing, down to earth Charlotte Lucas. Donald Sutherland's Mr Bennett is interestingly cast, an 18th century man, out of touch with the new century. This reinterpretation of period is one of the film's chief innovations and delights. The Bennett family and surroundings represent the rougher, less polished 18th century; while the expensive BIngleys and Darcys are the modern and determinedly fashionable face of the more restrictive and cold early 19th century (I know which I'd rather have lived in).If I didn't know intimately what would 'happen next' in every single scene, I think I'd have got lost, as script rehashes paid every sacrifice to the constraints of the modern film format. Periodically, however, screenwriter Moggach dredges up beautiful snatches of long-forgotten original dialogue which truly add to the charm of the piece. I really disliked the second proposal: both of them looking like they've walked out of a commercial for a chocolate bar or a shampoo. I also didn't much like the brazen and showy use of Chatsworth as Darcy's home. Using so well known a building has an alienating effect, engendering disbelief at a point in the story when you most need to believe in Darcy as a real, and not a fairytale, man.My favourite moment comes in a scene at Bingley's Netherfield house: Lizzie and Miss Bingley have been 'taking a turn' about the room, and meantime exchanging sharp witticisms and sly flirting with Darcy, who sits, writing, in the centre of the room. In the scene's final shot, Darcy, in the foreground, pauses, discomfited, pen in hand, while behind him the two ladies part and circle, for all the world like cats circling prey. A finely judged shot, and in fact the whole film is beautifully shot and lit throughout. However, I find myself preferring the 80s Fay Weldon adaptation more and more as time goes by. Elizabeth Garvie's delicately drawn, gentle Lizzie, and the stately pace and modest tone of the whole, seem to suit my taste much better. This sort of attempt  to sex up what is already plenty sexy if you only ensure that the leads have chemistry and the sparkling, witty dialogue remains firmly in place  just makes the least of the available material. Of course, as a woman in love with romanticism, that doesn't mean I won't be watching the DVD until it wears out",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Come On! Give 'em A Break!,"My goodness, the movie wasn't that bad!! As a side note, I have seen the A&E production and it is my favorite movie of all time; I watch it at least once a week, all 300 minutes of it! I think a lot of people went to this movie expecting it to be just like the last one. But what would be the purpose of making it just the same?! I would have been disappointed if it had been. And good grief, it was only 2 hours...surely you wouldn't expect them to get every last detail in- unless you want them to run the tape double or triple speed!

"Entertaining, but can't stop comparing to the BBC mini series","I'm a die hard Pride and Prejudice fan both reading the book, watching the mini series on either TV or via my own copy on DVD. The movie version with Keira Knightly is entertaining, but I can't help by continuously comparing it the BBC mini series. From the scenery, cast of characters and how they've adapted the book, I will always prefer the BBC version.Although I prefer the BBC version, I found this version added humor to the story, therefore giving it an added twist and keeping it entertaining. Not convinced of Keira as Elizabeth Bennett, but Rosamund Pike was good as Jane. Additionally, Tom Hollander is great as the bumbling Mr. Collins. Wouldn't rush out and buy it on DVD, but entertaining for the 2 hr long movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Should we rejoice at the inferiority of this rendition?,"For the sake of starting with something positive, let's throw out the very biggest problems like historical placement and accuracy. If we can get stupid enough to ignore a boat load of adaptation problems, we might at least admit that this movie was beautifully designed and very well shot. Watch this monstrosity with the sound off, and you'll enjoy some remarkable cinematography.But no lavish castles or livid sunrises can rescue such a mess.First, we'd have to cut off the head of the beast in terms of raw materials and leadership. The screenplay borders on jabberwocky, honoring only the most banal of Austen's dialog. And despite being the consummate romance, director Joe Wright isn't able to coax anything more than a lukewarm shrug from any of the key players.Speaking of key players, let's look at casting.Keira Knightley (Pirates of the Caribbean, King Arthur) reduces the smart and self-possessed Elizabeth to little more than teen petulance. She strides triumphant through the movie, always armed with some well worn leather-bound tome (we can safely assume it's not Stanislavski), looking for ways to disarm people with her aplomb. Unfortunately, Knightley has a limited number of tools with which to construct the facade. One is a frightening and toothsome grin-laugh thing that turns her into a Rankin/Bass villain (a'la Burgermeister, the Bumble, HeatMiser, etc). The rest of the time, Knightley relies on her jutting jaw and droopy lip to illicit a blatant sexuality (which happens to be completely wrong for this character). However, instead of the intended pouty sex kitten allure, she looks as if a large dose of Thorazine is just kicking in. We half expect a ribbon of drool to escape down her chin at any moment.Then there is our darling Darcy. No one will ever touch the haughty torment of Colin Firth. Even if we hadn't seen Firth's Darcy, Macfadyen would seem a bit flat. We get precious little of his prickly pride (which is fairly significant to the story, being in the title and all). His too-soft underbelly is exposed the minute he sets eyes on Elizabeth, which irrevocably breaks the seal on his crusty credibility. The most powerful aspect of this romance (in the book & BBC version) is how it so utterly surprises Elizabeth - and us - when he makes that first proposal. Watching Macfadyen spill the beans in his first 10 seconds on screen leaves very little reason to keep watching. He could have benefited from just a bit of Caroline Bingley's over-the-top nastiness.As for the rest of the cast, they come in two flavors: shallow and boring, or giggly and squirming like cheerleaders in the back of the bus. One has to wonder if it took more than Thorazine to get the rest of the cast through this project, particularly after seeing Donald Sutherland's version of Mr. Bennett. Dreamy and completely disconnected, laudanum appears to be his buffer of choice. Of course we expect Lydia and Kitty to be a bit silly, which they are, but they both seem to be in the throes of a bad Ecstasy binge. Their squealing and twittering is relentless and positively manic. And poor Mr. Collins (actor Tom Hollander, who also plays the deliciously neurotic and ruined Anthony Meredith in Gosford Park) appears to be stoned out of his head and on the brink of full-on paranoia, although trying very ...hard ...not to be. He was definitely capable of giving David Bamber (the A&E Collins) a run for his money in this role. Unfortunately, ""big eyes and stick-up-the-arse marionette movement"" must have been Wright's direction for the unfortunate Hollander.Countless smaller irritations abound: The evil Mr. Wickham has roughly 9 words of dialog with which to make us first adore and then despise him (a fancy trick for any actor, let alone someone with no noticeable screen time). Dame Judy Dench is sadly overcast as the fiery old crone, Lady Catherine de Bourg, which is exactly the same as every other role she's been saddled with for the last 10 years. What a tragic waste. And she brought almost too much credibility to the trivial Lady Catherine. Even Charles Bingley's sunny disposition seems to be drawn in crayon. Far from the agreeable innocent we all adore, he comes off as weak and mildly retarded and seemingly incapable of combing his particularly unruly shock of ginger hair. The result is some kind of love child of Liberace and Howdy Doody. Darcy would have never befriended someone like this, and not just because of the hair. Brenda Blethyn (Little Voice, Saving Grace) turns in the only enjoyable performance as the terminally squirrelly Mrs. Bennett. At least she's fun to watch, albeit in the manner of a fuzzy rodent with a firecracker tied to her tail. But she occasionally lacked conviction in terms of her chronic ""nervous condition.""When will Hollywood learn that unless you bleed every 28 days or are named Ang Lee, you're not qualified to handle Jane Austen? Go tackle the Brontes. And there must be at least a half dozen more gladiator movies waiting to be made or remade. Heck, take Dickens on another spin around the dance floor! But leave the next Austen adaptation to the BBC, A&E, or Masterpiece Theatre where they might still care more about characters and story than honoring a 5-picture deal for the latest tarted-up teen stars.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"must...remain...faithful...to Colin Firth...and a&e...AAGH, why is it soo good?!?!","I must admit that I went into the theatre almost completely biased and determined to dislike this movie and Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Darcy because who on earth could live up to Colin Firth's gorgeously arrogant and aristocratic portrayal of Fitzwilliam? I tried to dislike it, I tried to find fault. Damn it all, blast and wretch!! Urgh, all right, all right, it's good, it's GOOD...!!Keira Knightley, i think, is a better choice for playing Lizzy because while Jennifer Ehle is a good actress and fairly attractive, Keira shows Lizzy's rough edges and unconventional beauty in the Victorian era. And I know it sounds weird, but Keira's body type fits Lizzy better I think. Jennifer has gorgeous flawless smooth white skin and is just barely plump-ish, and has perfect curls; to me this does NOT seem like Lizzy Bennett. Now Keira Knightley has a slightly almost ruddy complexion, slightly messy hair, is tall and lanky, and has pretty much no boobs. Jennifer, has boobs. It may seem weird, but it makes sense.By the end of the movie, I loved Matthew Macfadyen even though I felt like I was betraying my dear Colin Firth. As far as the image of arrogance and self-importance, Colin succeeds better. But when it comes to Darcy informing Lizzy of his love for her, Macfadyen is better in that he really looked ticked off that he's tried so hard not to like her but he just can't help himself and that makes him even more ticked off. I could totally see the thoughts of ""I've tried SO FREAKING HARD to not even like you, let alone, love you, and I still do, it's against my better judgement, you're beneath me, it would be socially stupid of me to marry you, but god help me, I love you and I want to marry you.""Mrs. Bennett, haha, she's great: a fidgety scheming nervous wreck of a woman. Wonderful. ^_^ Mr. Bennett was delightful in his own small role: laid back and does well with his few little funny bits. Judi Dench was wonderful as Lady Catherine de Bourg, although I kept thinking of her as the crotchety and full-of-vinegar Armande in ""Chocolat"". ^_^ He's ridiculous, but I felt really bad for poor Mr. Collins because no one really ever listens to him, not even his wife. Kitty and Lydia were wonderfully giggly Victorian teeny-bopper flirts.I did wonder a little at the cinematography, as far as closeups went. It just seemed like every time the camera panned to another person, it would zoom in just a little when they spoke, and then when the camera panned back again, it would do its little zoom think again.Costumes were great, even though I've always detested most of the Victorian styles for women. Darcy still looks good...Scenery was nice, especially Darcy's house. Good freakin' LORD, that place is HUGE, and sooo NICE! Which reminds me of another character analysis: Tamzin Merchant as Georgiana was adorable! And the little knowing look she gave to her brother when Lizzy was in the room, well, it was perfect. ~_^So yes, even though it pains me and I feel disloyal to A & E and Colin Firth, I must give this film a 9 out of 10 for wonderful awkward moments, superb acting, and the most-perfect-to-date portrayal of Jane Austen's novel I have ever seen.thespian wishes,~*kitty Walsh*~",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
My Favorite version,This is my favorite version of one of my favorite books. I love the aura I got from both main characters. Matthew was wonderful as Mr. Darcy. I almost felt compelled to want to hug him myself. He really seemed so sad that I forgot he was acting at times. Donald Sutherland was wonderful as the father. His wit came thru so well. I actually can't think of any character that wasn't well played. Tom Hollander deserved snaps for his portrayal of Mr. Collins. I cringed at the thought of marrying him too LOL. If you are a Jane Austin fan you will love this version. It seemed a little modern yet very British. The only character I couldn't get passed was Rupert Friend playing nasty Mr. Wickham.

2 out of 10,"Over the top is the first thing that comes to mind within the first 30 minutes of the film. Too many giggles, too much exaggeration, a supersaturation of color and movement, and with no loyalty to the dialog and subtlety which makes the characters and the storyline of the novel so unforgettable. At times it seemed as though I were in Willy Wonka or the Wizard of Oz with so much motion and chatter and elaborate expression.Keira Knightley is ineptly cast as Elizabeth Barrett. She is too pretty and misses in engaging the nuances of the Lizzie we've all come to know and love. Mr. Barrett, an overly relaxed Donald Sutherland, seems henpecked into a state of lethargy by his overbearing wife. The sophistication of the characters who are admired in the story are completely lost in the attempts to force a laugh or two from the audience. A complete disappointment.",,Anonymous,Romance
Lively start but ultimately disappointing,"I prepared for this film by watching again the 1995 BBC version - perhaps a mistake. Still when the film started I was heartened by the opening scenes of the Bennett home and family. The assembly and Netherfield ball were terrific. But I gradually found myself getting bored. Plot development faltered, there was nil on-screen chemistry between Knightly and McFadden, the Lydia/Wickham subplot came and went with only one sentence to explain its significance to the rest of the girls' futures. The costumes and settings began to jar and instead of just enjoying the film I kept wondering about it's accuracy - did Mr Bennett really keep farm animals? Would he really have hugged Mary after the piano incident in quite such a modern-Dad sort of way?.Knightly looks good, too good, but I just couldn't see her as Lizzie, and several times her voice tone and inflection exactly mirrored Ehle's. McFadden is not convincing. The music is excellent, the humming of the servant girl a lovely touch. The scenery and settings are beautiful, but again they didn't seem quite right for Austen. Much of the dialogue is dull. I just couldn't settle into this film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant by all means,"Pride and Prejudice was the best movie I've seen in a very long time,if not the best I've ever seen. It captured the very essence of Jane Austen's brilliant novel. In fact, I enjoyed the movie more than the book itself. Everything about the movie was perfect. The soundtrack is exquisite, and it complements the emotional plot; the sets are delicate and simple, but elegant; the acting, simply superb. Knightley proved to be a lovely Elizabeth Bennet, and Darcy was exactly how I envisioned him. Rarely do the author's, reader's and director's visions coincide to advance the very nature of human communication, but this movie did so. I particularly remember Darcy's first confession of his love in the rain - a timeless moment. This movie is a work of art, an emotional masterpiece. Watching this movie was actually a life changing experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not a patch on the BBC Miniseries,"I went and saw it today and my Dad remarked the BBC version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle sets the gold standard - every P+P will be compared to that.I think the main problems with this movie are that some characters are dreadfully miscast, the limited time (the BBC version had 6+ hours, but this only has two) and the time wasted on unnecessary scenes instead of character building.Bingley, for instance, is absolutely hopeless. He can't string two words together and is pathetic. You really wonder why Jane falls for him, and are even more bewildered to the fact that he is earning $5000 a year (he doesn't seem very intelligent!). The BBC mini series Bingley was well cast and didn't seem mentally retarded like this one. Keira Knightley is good. Same with the Mum. Jane was an angel. Darcy was surprisingly good. However, I found these characters didn't have the standard of the BBC version, and unfortunately a lot of characters were left out, leaving a huge gap.Also, there was a lot of time wasted on scenes which didn't really have to be there. There was a lot of dancing, watching Elizabeth walk, dream like scenes there which could have been replaced with character building. It wasn't as evident that Lizzie and her Father were very close. A lot of the main points (e.g the incident with Wickham) are hardly main at all. Wickham hardly gets any air time and I think he too is miscast, but certainly not as bad as Bingly.Another problem is that I think they tried to modernize this version a little to appeal to more people - probably more people who don't know a single thing about P+P, Jane Austen or the period in which this is Set. Some of the script isn't very old fashioned, as well as some of the hairstyles of the males.This version seems to have interpreted the Bennets as more lower class. Longborn is hideous, with broken windows and pigs running through. The table manners are disgusting (each man for themselves), and there are some thing in this movie that just aren't right. The BBC version portrays them as more reserved, more upper class people but still quite poor. It is much more believable that way.However this movie is not all bad. Lovely scenery, wonderful clothes, great houses.. but it's all a bit of an anti-climax, filled with miscast characters & inaccurate incidents. Not a patch on the beautifully done BBC miniseries. It's a hard thing to live up to.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Wonderful, absolutely fascinating, authentic for the period, very romantic","After a hard day at the office, I had taken my girlfriend to see the new Pride and Prejudice with Keira Knightley, and we lined up to see it on the big screen when it first came out several months ago. We both had liked the DVD of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility with Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet. I must say I was a firm believer in the Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth version, however yesterday I spent time with director Joe Wright's 2005 Pride and Prejudice film again on DVD at home. The first time I had liked it, but seeing it again in the intimacy of my home, I learned new details and had a new feeling about it, and listened to the director's commentary. This Keira Knightley-Mathew MacFadyen version is excellent, very romantic, there are special moments in the closing sequence with a sunrise, it is a revelation for other directors to note. An extremely sensitive orchestral piece reminiscent of Delius or Ravel closes the credits. The talented direction is from a young man, Joe Wright. He is insightful but how does he have so much experience? The National Trust locations, including Burghley House and Chatsworth in Derbyshire had me totally immersed and enthralled. Donald Sutherland, Brenda Blethyn, Simon Woods and the rest of the cast are excellent. Rosamund Pike playing the other sister is so stunningly beautiful,I could not take my eyes off her. I loved the dancing at the ball, it was so jolly and authentic. English dialogue interests me a great deal, and I like to browse into the making of a film, and that's when I came to the realization that this movie is after all a masterpiece from a young and new director. Long afterward, the romantic memory of it lingers with the viewer. Remarkable and rewarding, 10 stars.

a bit rushed,"I am an avid fan of the book and the 1995 TV adaptation. The film was always going to be shorter with less detail and the incredibly important play on words. However the overall impression of the story is rushed, the protagonists not that convincing and some of the key parts of the story just yanked out. For me the most important scenes of the story have been changed and underplayed and therefore ruined: Darcy's slighting Elisabeth at the ball and her falling for him at Pemberley. Saying that, it was beautifully shot, with amazing music that makes your heart flutter and with more flesh and energy compared to the BBC's version. But still Matthew McFadden is nothing to Colin Firth's Darcy. So, for all the fans out there, go and see it and judge it for yourself, but I fear you may be disappointed....",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Simply Stunning,"One of my favorite films to date, Pride and Prejudice is a film that is stunning on several levels: the performances are excellent, the soundtrack is amazing, and the cinematography is beyond comparison.One of the things I love so much about this movie is the atmosphere. With many movies, people will remark that they felt like they were actually there, witnessing the story. With Pride and Prejudice, I felt not only that I was there as an observer, but that this was MY world, too. The beautiful camera-work will just draw you right in.The performances were stellar. The entire cast was great, and it's interesting to note that, among the ""stars"" that made up the cast, there are several lesser known actors; this was the first movie credit for both Carey Mulligan (Kitty) and Tamzin Merchant (Georgiana).However, it's important to note that this movie is not entirely like the book. (Any spoilers that follow are minor and relate to the book, not the film.) Some of my favorite scenes from the novel were cut down or didn't appear in the movie at all. Other times, lines that were originally said by one character in the novel were said by another character in the movie. (The most amusing case being Miss Bingley's mocking line to Mary, ""Indeed, much more rational, but rather less like a ball"", which was directed at Miss Bingley herself in the novel.) Most of the differences are minor; for example, the absence of Maria Lucas on the trip to Rosings Park (she didn't play much of a role in the novel, anyway) and the potential relationship between Lizzie and Colonel Fitzwilliam (never even referenced in the film...however, this plot angle never really affected the outcome of Pride and Prejudice). The situation involving Lydia's marriage was not as major a part of the movie as it was of the novel. (Personally, that was a relief to me...that portion of the novel is what I usually skip over when I re-read the book.) Georgiana's character in the film is significantly different from her character in the book--the film portrays Georgiana as much more outgoing, while the novel describes her as shy and a bit socially awkward.All in all, I give this film excellent marks. It's not a word-for-word adaptation of the book, and cannot be considered a replacement for it (as in, ""Oh, I always meant to read Pride and Prejudice, but now I'll just see the movie."") Die-hard Jane Austen fans might not care for it so much, but, speaking as someone who loved both the book AND the movie, I can honestly say that it's a very satisfying and charming film.9.5/10 stars",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Characters, cinematography, music, acting, production - all great. Go and see it.","Wonderful adaptation of the classic.As a fan of the BBC TV series, I arrived expecting to be disappointed. I could imagine Matthew MacFadyen as Mr Darcy after his great role in Spooks, but must say I was sceptical of the casting of Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Bennet) and Rosamund Pike (Jane Bennet). Was I wrong! Casting was spot on and the cinematography was a visual feast. I loved the contrast between the slightly-down-at-heel Bennet house and the Great Houses. Music was wonderful throughout, as were the immersive, pulsating scenes at the Balls.The story remained very faithful to the book (as far as I can remember!), with the editing along the lines of a ""Readers Digest Condensed Book"" contraction rather than wholesale re-writing.

"Beautiful, romantic, and funny","Though not exactly like the novel, still a beautifully adapted script. Stellar performances by Brenda Blethyn, who delivers a heart warming and at times very funny performance as Mrs. Bennet. We should all have a mother that frets and cares so much for our future. Matthew MacFadyen offers up the most moving performance of Mr. Darcy I have yet seen in any performance of this story, and I've seen them all. His Mr. Darcy is human.

Do not expect to be enthralled with this mild and 'aimable' version of Pride and Prejudice,"A new screen version of the universally loved and favourite Jane Austen book is always bound to have a hard time with the critics. Pride and Prejudice, with the heroine, Lizzie Bennet (played by Keira Knightley), has to be compared with the book and also with the early 90's BBC adaption. The makers have tried hard, but this Pride and Prejudice is just not as good as the Colin Firth BBC TV Series. Despite being well adapted to fit a fairly long novel into a two hour production, the film lacks the dynamics and feelings which should be evoked by the tale. The chemistry between Lizzie and Mr Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen) is not believable. The Mr Darcy of this version is not seen often enough on screen and therefore his character is not so developed and loved by the viewers. Mr Darcy was portrayed as wooden, instead of shy. Other characters were wonderfully portrayed, such as Mr Collins, who was played with such empathy to the disastrous little man vying for Lizzie's affections. Keira Knightley was very good in the film, and honestly played Lizzie with a modern twist to her character and to the film. Donald Sutherland, playing (Mr Bennet), however was a disappointment, whose character was not developed and did not seem to be well cast.Now to the actual film... As I've mentioned before, the film was well adapted and the scenes were lively and energetic. However, the whole film was very Hollywood and clichéd. An example is Darcy's first proposal to Lizzie in the pouring rain, as well as the image of Darcy striding up to Elizabeth from the mist of the moors at the end. The love scenes were also not gripping and believable. Personally, I did not feel like I was watching the best sexual tension moments of all time.All in all, Pride and Prejudice is worth the watch, just to see a new version of the book. However, it is not the amazing and wonderful film which some may be hoping for. I think that those, like me, who are in love with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and their story, should stay true to that version!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
An excellent film from start to finish that was perfectly cast!,"This small gem of a film was extremely well-written, a delight from start to finish, and perfectly cast; in particular, the 2 leads, Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfadyen, were superb. Macfadyen made the character of Darcy far more sympathetic than in previous portrayals. In addition, the lead actors were closer in age to that of Lizzie and Darcy in the book. Although Austen purists criticize the editing and condensation of the book for this screen adaptation, the essence of the classic remains intact. I highly recommend this film and will be watching the careers of both the leads very closely; they were brilliant!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"No, it's not the BBC Mini-series.  It is, however, a wonderful film.","If you are a huge fan of the 1995 BBC mini-series, or more specifically if you are a middle-aged woman who is completely obsessed with Colin Firth's Darcy and get absurdly angry at the prospect of anyone else attempting to fill that role, then you shouldn't watch this film. I'm guessing that 99% of the bad reviews this movie has received on this site have come from women who have watched the BBC version 6,000 times and are disgusted by their poor husband/boyfriend because he's not more like Firth's Darcy.Ugh. I get chills just thinking about that. If you happen to be dating a woman and learn that she loves the BBC version of P&P, I would suggest that you run. Quickly. You will never live up to her expectations of a man. If you stay, you are doomed.As for the 2005 version of P&P, it is a gorgeously shot and scored film. The backgrounds are lovely, the colors, tones, and music are soft and alluring, and even the transitions between scenes are often surprisingly well thought out. For example, there is one scene that ends with Elizabeth blowing out a candle which cuts directly into a shot of a whipping piece of fabric, and the two sounds are almost identical. Very clever.The script does stray from the book, but I personally like that. If I want to read the book, I'll read the book (which I have done many, many times mind you). This movie expounds more on the love between Lizzy/Darcy and Jane/Bingley, and modernizes the atmosphere and the attitudes just enough to remove some of the obnoxiously dull stuffiness of England's Regency period. The actors are wonderful, particularly Knightley, but especially Simon Woods who plays Mr. Bingley. His wide-eyed, warm-hearted charm is very funny and enjoyable to watch. Donald Sutherland was very good as well, the last scene between his Mr. Bennett and Elizabeth was quite powerful and made me quite happy that I'll be the father of a baby daughter in the near future.So, to summarize...1) It's not the BBC version.2) Colin Firth is not in it.3) If you are a man who is involved with a woman who is obsessed with Colin Firth's Darcy, then I feel sorry for you.4) If you appreciate quality film-making, enjoy good-humored romance stories, and don't particularly care about this movie being exactly like the book (i.e. you're not a ""Janeite""), then you'll very much enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Jane Austen's world altered too much.....,"I was looking forward to this adaption of JAne Austen's masterpiece. The BBC series was absolutely perfect, as it went at a reasonable pace in episodes so you felt you didn't miss out on anything. This adaptation takes what made Austen's work intriguing as a social study subject and wrecks it by modernising it that it portrays society that was not like it was back in the 19th century. Keira Knightly does a seemingly good job though, but lacks the intelligence that Jennifer Ehle had. The women act more bubbly than is allowed in this time. For example, Mr Darcy's sister meeting Elizabeth was one of the worst scenes in the film, and did not stay true to her character's predicament or personality.It is difficult to adapt Pride and Prejudice on the big screen in just roughly two hours, so I could say that it is a modest job. However, the elopment of Lydia is done way too quickly to feel any remorse for the Bennett family and their situation. However, the feel of the film, the art direction and casting is quite well done, but the whole pace and tone of the film does not match well with their surrounding environment.All i can say is, is that if Jane Austen saw this, i'm sure she'd be pointing some things out during a screening of this.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A movie tailored to modern teens, methinks","I really wanted to like the movie; I even dragged my husband along -in the afternoon. I really was in the mood, but I was so disappointed. Pride and Prejudice resonates today, I think, because the most worthy girl gets the best man; not the most beautiful girl, for we all know rich and powerful men love beautiful women. (Canada's Prime Minister Trudeau used to walk into a room and pick out the most beautiful woman, airhead or not, and talk to her all night).P and P is a fantasy we like because Lizzy is 'only tolerable.' It's her mind that is superior. She makes the perfect match for Darcy because, like himself and like Darbyshire, she is a perfect balance of animal energy and civility. It would be hard being an atistocrat's wife (see Kennedy wife) and you do believe that LIzzy and Darcy would make a perfect couple. Knightley's Lizzie is too beautiful and too impetuous. She's even rude to both her parents! This LIzzie and Darcy would be a disaster, once the hormones had cooled down. I can see her dancing naked in the rain in Permberly and being locked in a wing by Darcy for the rest of her life. (Like Margaret Trudeau, the free spirit and beautiful wife of Trudeau, who lost it under the pressure.) And the dumbed down dialogue, eek. and when Knightley does utter classic lines, she sounds exactly like Jennifer Ehle. McFayden( is that the spelling) has a nice physique (I grant you that :) but he does not have Firth's pipes. You need a sexy voice to make the 'courtship' dialogue seem sexy, I think. But maybe I""m old fashioned...",,Anonymous,Romance

From One Austenphile to others,"The basic Plot is boy meets girl. Boy thinks girls family is beneath him, and girl thinks boy is a snot. Girl makes some assumptions further about boy's character based on information from a questionable source. Boy falls in love with girl. Boy confesses his love and is rejected. Girl goes off and contemplates that she may have allowed prejudice to sway her before the facts. Boy goes off and contemplates if he has been too full of pride or just plain full of himself. Boy and girl meet again. Girl's sisters become an obstacle to their relationship developing further. And eventually all is resolved. There are finer details, and if you really want to know, read the book.Performances by Matthew MacFayden, Kiera Knightley, Brenda Blethyn, Judi Dench, Donald Sutherland, Tom Hollander,and Rosamund Pike were especially good. I also liked Jenna Malone and Rupert Friend who set a standard for their roles.I was pleased with some of the changes made in terms of portraying the characters. I feel this movie was more sympathetic towards some of Austen's characters who are often easily written off as caricatures. I like seeing Elizabeth portrayed as somewhat adolescent in her temper. I like the added scene between Mary and her father at the ball. I like Mrs. Bennet telling Lizzy that ""When you have five daughters, we'll see what you think of."" I appreciated the realism of this cast. I also liked how this film showed Mr and Mrs Bennet as having some relationship between them. I forgive them consolidating scenes. I even forgave them the alteration of the critical final disclosure scene between Elizabeth and Darcy. I forgive them cutting some of the smaller characters,I think that's to be expected. I think the story boils down to growth. It's about two people who challenge each other's view point and consequently become catalysts for change within each other.I also want to add, that the scene between them on the Rosing's estate in the rain, was very erotic and a superbly fresh interpretation of the script.And so in the end, that is why I vehemently object to the exchange between Charolette and Elizabeth after the former announces her engagement. It's believable that Lizzy opens her mind through examining the choices of her friend. It's less believable that Lizzy changes perspective because her friend tells her to. Also,in another scene, I vehemently object to the notion that The Gardiners would leave Elizabeth and drive back to town in their carriage without her. Not even remotely possible. So ultimately while I love what was preserved, and I love some of the enhancements, I walked away with a sour aftertaste in my mouth. But I still plan to buy it on video.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's Not Pride and Prejudice,"This movie is not bad, it's just it isn't Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, just as Bridget Jones isn't. It had the same plot line, but all the characters are different, and the aim of the movie is different from that of the book.Jane Austen comments on social etiquette, and pokes fun at those who are too full of self importance. This movie is entirely about falling in love, and with modern attitudes and morals. Lizzie Bennet in this movie is not the smart, socially adept Elizabeth Bennet of the book, and nor is her sister Jane.If you are willing to forget the book than this film is good fun. It is let down by some fairly wooden acting (espeically from Matthew McFadden sadly) in places, and by some rather strange choices in fashion (what was Caroline Bennet wearing?) and decor in some of the houses. It was also fairly obvious that Matthew McFadden hadn't read the book as his interpretation of Darcy was very odd, not so much arrogant as lost little boy. And the closing scene rated on a par with the ""is it raining? I hadn't noticed"" cheese of Four Weddings and Funeral. But all in all you will laugh in the right places, and have a good time watching it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Ouch,"This film is bad. There are no words that do justice to what this film has done to the most beloved work of one of the greatest English authors. To start with, the film cannot seem to decide when it is set. We see scenes and costumes from a plethora of different historical periods (especially in the ballroom scenes). This is nothing to the dialogue, however, which cannot decide if it wants to be modern or self-consciously antiquated. Apparently just using Austen's dialogue would be too easy. The characters' manners wouldn't fit into any period (see Georgianna Darcy in particular). The scene of Darcy's second proposal appears to have been stolen from a Mills and Boon novel. I can only imagine that the makers of this film have never read the book or were just having a laugh. Even the acting doesn't redeem it, as even great performers collapse under an absurd script. The two leads are particularly bad as they attempt to smoulder. Please do not go to see this film, as giving them money would only serve to encourage this sort of thing.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A film worth watching.,"The Pride and Prejudice film adaption directed by Joe Wright in 2005 is a classic of cinema. This film brings Jane Austen's classic work to life with unmatched grace and charm, thanks to its stunning cinematography and painstaking attention to detail.This film is unique because it explores each character's uniqueness in great detail. From Elizabeth Bennet to Mr. Collins, every person is thoughtfully and nuancedly examined, enabling the audience to empathize with their challenges and motivations. Elizabeth is brilliantly portrayed by Keira Knightley, who effortlessly captures her humor, intelligence, and fragility. She is a sympathetic and inspirational heroine because of her genuine portrayal.Mr. Darcy by Matthew Macfadyen is just as captivating. Macfadyen skillfully captures the slow change from his initial pride and aloofness to tenderness and sincerity. Knightley and Macfadyen have a chemistry that is electric, and their conversations are full of emotion, tension, and unsaid admiration.The supporting cast is just as excellent. Donald Sutherland gives Mr. Bennet warmth and insight, while Brenda Blethyn plays Mrs. Bennet in a humorously controlling role. Tom Hollander's Mr. Collins is both clumsy and charming, while Rosamund Pike's Jane Bennet radiates elegance and compassion. Lady Catherine de Bourgh, played by Dame Judi Dench, is a formidable presence who delivers her lines with the acerbic authority that the role requires. The way this adaptation strikes a mix between faithfulness to the original work and a novel cinematic interpretation is what really sets it apart. It offers a contemporary accessibility that strikes a deep chord with audiences today while being faithful to Austen's themes of love, class, and self-discovery.To put it briefly, Pride and Prejudice (2005) is a success. Through magnificent craftsmanship and motivational performances, the film not only pays tribute to Jane Austen's classic novel but also elevates it. This film is a must-see regardless of whether you're a devoted Austen fan or unfamiliar with the novel.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Indeed, a masterpiece!","I must say: this movie deserves handsome appreciation as it perfectly deals with different aspects of human nature as well as society, at the same time. First of all it depicts a portrait of a middleclass family, consisting of a husband and a wife, who have five daughters. In the portrayal of this family, it signifies a dominant plight of society. It shows how burdensome it gets for middle-classed parents to find suitable matches for their daughters, especially when the society is flagrantly polarized and divided into classes. The mother in this family is almost always seen striving to get her daughters married to reasonable men; indeed her only whish while being alive.
Love, with its potency, is another important subject that has aptly been touched in this movie. When Mr Darcy finds himself head-over-heel in love for Elizabeth, he instantly gets ready to sacrifice even his much-cherished ego as well as his remarkable reticence. Under the influence of love, Darcy seems to be unbothered about his family's comparatively higher social status than that of Elizabeth's. He wants nothing but Elizabeth as her life partner, even if it is possible at the stake of everything else he has have, be it his family's status, his self-respect or anything else.
To sum up, this movie is highly recommended to everyone who desires to develop a better understanding of varied fault lines prevalent and ubiquitous in our societies.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Review,"Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is one of my favorite books. Due to that fact, it was crucial for me to see a worthy work from the side of filmmakers and I think that they did it. In particular, they demonstrated perfectly the mood of the characters. I saw the real emotions and feelings of Mr. Darcy. The actor greatly demonstrated Darcy's stiffness and cold-blooded. I mostly liked the part when he told about his feelings to Elizabeth. At that moment I felt his nervousness with the help of his eye play. Also, I want to talk about the actress, who played the role of Elisabeth's mother. I admired her throughout the film. Of course, we all know that her characteristics are not the gooiest one and I really cannot understand her as a mother, the way how she acted with her daughters. Nevertheless, the actress, who played this role, perfectly fitted in her role and I believed her. Thus, I think that this movie is worth watching.",,Anonymous,Romance

I only went because i got free tickets from the National Trust (who supplied access to many of the buildings used in the shooting). But, I thought it was an excellent adaptation. It is indeed hard to fit all the nuances of a classic novel in two hours, but i thought they did exceptionally well with this hard task. I thought nearly all the actors did a fine job. Kiera excelled my expectations of her, and take no notice of previous comments on Matthew McFadden's role, I thought he handled it with aplomb. Brenda and Donalds pairing was inspired and both revelled in their respective roles. I took my wife to see this and she gave it ten out of ten.

However, the ground production values themselves (such as acting, plot) seem a bit hindered by the grandness of the visuals, as whilst fine in their own right, seem somewhat lame compared to the lush displays, thus harming the experience with a beautiful exterior almost destroying an adequate interior. Needless to say, it's still recommended, as it generally seems a good effort, and will probably be enjoyed by those who like period pieces.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

I feel, its not overused as so often, nor replaces or blows up anything, but illustrates the inner landscapes with just another array of colours, matching those of the photography.Its fun, sexy in understated and unexpected ways, humorous, and well paced, ""to breathe the sunrise is to truly open your heart"".A lovely, fresh, entertaining surprise of movie-fruit, that leaves you with a smile on your face, once the tears of joy you've shared with Donald Sutherland have subsided. ;-) Anja",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great leading lady, disappointing leading man","As a fan of the novel I have to say that it was with a little trepidation that I went to see this but it is an enjoyable movie. Keira Knightley is superb as Elizabeth, with the right mix of liveliness and impudence without losing the sense of propriety that was so dear to Jane Austen's heart. I also thought that Donald Sutherland was quite impressive and his accent was very convincing on the whole (although it did slip a bit once or twice). I thought he really carried off the role of Mr Bennett very well adding a strong edge to him. Dame Judi Dench is of course a scene-stealer as Lady Catherine de Bourgh (but then she never fails to disappoint) and Brenda Blethyn truly brings Mrs Bennet alive. All the female leads presented robust and enjoyable characters. For me the disappointment lay with the male leads (other than Mr Bennet). Darcy instead of being arrogant and proud comes across as a bit wet and frankly looks lost and miserable for most of the movie. Mr Bingley seems almost silly on a number of occasions. It is difficult to flesh out the characters of a novel like Pride and Prejudice in a movie but the male characters are very shallow and one-dimensional. Wickham is almost invisible. Perhaps just as disappointing is the dialogue. Jane Austen wrote some fabulous dialogue in this novel and it seems a shame that it was so little used. Why not have used some of the great lines already in P&P?",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wretched,"No one go see Pride & Prejudice. It is the most wretched, boring, miserable movie I have seen all year. Keira Knightley does not look or act the part (note how she chooses to act with her chin every time she gets emphatic) and I've sold lumber more charismatic and interesting than the man who plays Mr. Darcy. There are so many clichéd shots (if I ever have to see someone stare at a candle in the foreground for an entire shot while having a conversation, and then blow it out for the scene change, or a door slamming shut with a dull, resounding crash directly into the camera, I may scream.)Darcy is boring; Collins is boring; Bingley looks like a woman; Mrs. Bennett is not funny as she is in the BBC version, she is merely irritating. And oh the giggling. The horrid, horrid giggling. I think a good 15 minutes of this movie is comprised of giggling. Another 15 goes to ""moving"" shots of the beautiful landscape, while Lizzie stares pensively into the distance.I offer this as an especial warning to anyone who has not read the novel, who would be doing themselves a horrible disservice by seeing the movie before reading the book and watching the delightful Colin Firth BBC version - which is in every imaginable way a superior film to this sack of sugary rubbish.Thank you.

I'm Proud and Rejoiced.,"With the exception of Tom Hollander's absurdly silly Mr. Collins, the characterization of every character is flawless. And with the exception of the overly-fluffy and stuffy period pieces first act, Joe Wright captured the spirit of Jane Austen's classic novel astonishingly: Austen's biting sarcastic, yet delicate humour runs through the vein of this film.What I love the most about Jane Austen is that she has a strong control over her characters: she develops them throughout the novel so exquisitely, and she can change the reader's perception of them so gracefully. And of course that was my biggest concern about this film: I doubted that such thing can be done on screen convincingly. I daresay Moggach's screenplay managed to pay justice to the characters, and their development, in a way I've never thought it would be possible.Besides the aforementioned nitpicks, I have some other quibbles: I think Lydia's elopement is a turning point in the story and the film should've laid stress on it more, and I think the same should have been applied to Mr. Darcy's ""revealing"" letters to Lizzy.Other than that, I think this is an astonishing adaptation, and a one that truly benefits from being condensed - for I think the novel gets a bit monotonous at some point. All the actors and actresses are perfect for their roles: I would've never thought I would say that about Rosamund Pike having seen Gone Girl first, but she is perfect as the most innocent and persuasively ideal character, Jane Bennet. Keira Knightley delievered her best performance in her career by far, and I think out of all the roles she played, this is the only one that trully shows her talent.(9/10)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Acting Needed Improvement,"I understand they had to fit a lot of content into this movie, but I did not feel that many of the characters were developed as they should have been. Mrs. Bennet was not as tiresome as portrayed in the book, Mr. Wickham seemed kind and hardly deceitful, Lydia was tolerable, and even Lizzy wasn't as quick as I would have liked her to be. I felt that many of the lines were delivered without reaction to the other actors. In one scene, Mrs. Bennet made a statement and Mr. Bennet started his comeback before she'd even finished her statement. The movie rushed through the important character-building details, yet took lengthy latitude with unimportant details...and there was a particularly nauseating moment when Lizzy just sat on the swing and circled around for a full minute.Lady Catherine and Mr. Collins were the only truly convincing actors.All in all I was disappointed, and wished there could have been more passion and tension between the actors. And how could they not give us a kiss at the end! That is just cruel after sitting through 2 hours of courtship.I enjoyed the funny moments, however, and the scenery was beautiful and believable.

Twizard Rating: 96,"It's a well-known tale from Jane Austen back in the early 19th century. In a society where the only thing anybody seems to think about is finding a good suitor for his or her children, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are busy with five daughters to stress about. Lucky for them, one of their five, Lizzie (Keira Knightley), has a good enough grasp on her own independence to figure things out for herself.If you can understand the British lilt accompanying the archaic repartee used throughout much of this film, then more power to you. Luckily, it doesn't hinder my ability to comprehend the main story, but the problem lies in the lighthearted banter that picks up the mood between dramatic ambits. Some things may get lost in translation, but it gets its point across.Matthew MacFadyen does well as the famed Mr. Darcy. When you first see him on screen, he's so cold that you have no idea how that man is capable of love of any kind. He and Knightley's chemistry grows as their characters' does.Lizzie, being from a more middle-class family, and Mr. Darcy, a wealthy personage of significance, have unspoken tensions and reservations about each other regarding financial status. And obviously, the point is that we should look past superficial attraction and at true character. However, this is derailed a bit as director Joe Wright's order of things gives us some reason to believe that Lizzie could, in fact, be falling in love with Mr. Darcy for those exact reasons. I assure you, this is far from Austen's original intent.Nonetheless, this 2005 adaptation means well and is a classic piece of modern cinema. It may not be my first choice of drama to watch on any given day, but the impressive performances by the whole cast, along with the very consistent pacing make for an enjoyable watch. The beautiful scenery and set pieces are a plus, providing a pleasurable watch all the way to the end.Twizard Rating: 96",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
You can do better,"I bought myself the 2005 Pride and Prejudice staring Keira Knightley and, well, was disappointed. The Cinematography is astounding the musical score was great, The location shots are breath taking, the actors were beautiful to look at, yes they were, but the costumes were not well done. I realize the Bennett family lived in the country but Pa-lease! This was way wrong. And while some things were well portrayed, as far as, Regency society some things were so horribly wrong that it ruined the movie for several minutes while I ranted about how wrong it that was.This movie got nominations and praise out the wazoo and I was let down because I love Jane and the BBC miniseries production of Pride and Prejudice really spoiled me. I realized that the new movie would be edited, it isn't an over 5+ hour miniseries, yet the story adaptation itself was pretty good, however, the dialog in portions needed serious help. I'm sorry, but do not modernize Jane. All the smart wit is gone when you toy with the language for portions of, often, important speeches. My favorite Bennett family member, Mr. Bennett, was very poorly represented in this adaption. He has some of the best moments in the book and unfortunately for times sake, I am sure, most of his intelligence and fatherly love is lost in this adaption. I did, however, come to like Jane Bennett more in this Adaptation that the BBC miniseries. All the other sisters are little more than background noise in this version.",,Anonymous,Romance
A Harlequin version of P&P,"I really enjoyed this movie but, like most Austen interpretations, there were moments to cause me to wince. This one had more than the classic Ehle/Firth 1995 miniseries in less than half the running time, but the result was entertaining.Plusses:+ The film did a better job of ""show, don't say"" than earlier versions. My main complaint about the Garvie/Rintoul BBC version of the '80s was that characters too often mouthed Austen's words when there should have been a visual portrayal instead. This film cut letter-reading to an all-time low.+ Related to the above, this version drew a sharp visual distinction between the costly gentility (and cleanliness) of Netherfield and the shabbiness of the Bennets' Longbourne. The Bennets ""cleaned up nice"" when needed, but they didn't live in spotless splendor.+ There was a tendency to move scenes to more dramatic settings, like the portico of a rainswept mausoleum. This was both good and bad.+ The film brought out the character of the father a bit more. Donald Sutherland was terrific.+ Judi Densch as Lady Catherine.+ I liked how the script compressed the early action and drew out the final resolution. Again, an opportunity for Donald Sutherland.+ Kiera Knightley is lovely, and a treat to watch on the screen.Minuses:Related to the above, Elizabeth was much prettier than Jane. Wrong.The movie had too many ""Harlequin Moments"" in which the characters did the sort of gestures associated with hormone-driven romance stories. This had the most kissing and almost-kissing of any Austen adaptation I've seen. I wonder if this was just to provide imagery for the previews.Related to the above: unmarried male characters spent an unrealistically large amount of time in the presence of unrelated female characters whilst the latter were clad only in nightwear. Titilating and suggestive, perhaps, but unrealistic for the period.Time and story compression. At some points it seemed like we were being propelled through the plot at breakneck speed. The script does a reasonable job of covering the major events, but of course some are shortchanged in the warp speed presentation.I had to get used to various bits of modern speech, like the clip from the preview where Darcy says ""Not if I can help it!""Unlike other films, Elizabeth was shown to be only slightly competent at the piano, making it clear that Darcy could only like her for her ""liveliness of mind."" An interesting difference that I'm not sure is good or bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
not tolerable enough to tempt me,"I think it is saying something that the Bollywood ""Bride and PRejudice"" stayed more faithful to the source material than this 2005 Hollywood version did. I also laughed more at the Bollywood version. (Mr. Kholi? Priceless!) If you have read the book or seen the 1995 BBC version (and liked them), you will be in for a nasty surprise going in to this film then. My friend however, who had seen neither, was mildly amused by the film. If you are a JAne Austen purist though, or even a film-goer who dislikes historical inaccuracies, it will be painful to sit through this.Ugh, the script. The script was the biggest problem. I imagine the actors wouldn't have fared half so badly if they'd had a decent script, perhaps penned by somebody who actually loved Austen's work.What travesties were committed? Well, you'll be forced to endure such incredulous lines as ""Don't you dare judge me, Lizzy!"" and ""Leave me alone for once in your lives!"". Not only are such lines far from anything that could come from Jane Austen's eloquent pen, but can anyone honestly believe words like that spilling from the mouth of a genteel young lady from the Regency era? The usage of modern colloquialisms is one of the many irritating ways that the screenwriter butchers the book. The writer also decided to give characters lines that, in the book, were said by a completely different characters and all for no apparent purpose. Worse of all, when they do try to stick a bit closer to the book's writing, the screenwriter has a nasty and unnecessary habit of rearranging Austen's phrases and substituting awkward synonyms for her already perfect words. It was as if the screenwriter sat down with the book in one hand and a thesaurus in the other when writing the script. Stick to Austen's words; she did it better than you! I assume all of this was done in a ""revisionist"" spirit and in an effort to distance this film from the iconic 1995 BBC version. However, for me, it also made a travesty of the true spirit of Austen's most beloved work.The casting did have potential, though it was quickly dashed away once the script kicked in. But Keira, giggling excessively and baring your crooked teeth does not equal charm and vivacity! And I think Mr. McFayden, though I find him tolerably handsome enough, misread his script and was under the impression he was playing Heathcliff and not the formidable Mr. Darcy. I really did enjoy Brenda Blethyn, Kelly Reilly and the actor who played Mr. Collins. Their interpretations were really rather refreshing.Oh, but Donald Sutherland! Somebody described his performance as seeming like a hobo who had accidentally wandered onto the movie set and I must say it is an apt description. And can somebody tell me why they fashioned Wickham after Legolas? Though he was in the movie for under two minutes, I daresay, and without his impressive archery skills to perk up the movie.On a wardrobe note, I would kill for Miss Bingley's dresses because they were sumptuous and would fit in more with the modern century. (A sleeveless Regency evening gown? Please! More Versace than Austen, that is sure) And poor Keira, all of the budget went to her salary and not her wardrobe! Oh, and I'm sure they eventually caught the bastard who stole the one hairbrush from the movie set. Unfortunately, they didn't catch him soon enough to comb the actresses' tresses before filming rolled.In short, with this new Hollywood version, bid adieu to Austen's eloquence, subtlety and wit because you'll be getting the complete opposite.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Yearing to see it again,"I can tell you it is beautiful, funny, heartbreaking and the UK version leaves you aching to see it again......and again......and again.The distributors in the US rather patronisingly IMO decided to give what us Brits and I'm sure most intelligent Yanks would call a Hollywood Ending and much as I will enjoy seeing it in the deleted scenes part of the DVD I am glad it's not on our edit. I was lucky enough to see a Q & A where Joe & Keira both agreed that the UK version felt right. They even went to the trouble of re-shooting the ending to see if they could make the Hollywood one work but were still not satisfied.I hope that's not too much info.Joe Wright and Deborah Moggach have truly understood the medium of film (as opposed to TV serial drama) and distilled a wonderful story running at just over two hours from a richly textured book in such a way that stuns belief. You know there are tons of things left out but you really don't miss them. Joe said he was sad they couldn't afford to cover any of Jane's trip to London but it doesn't spoil the story. It feels totally complete. The cinematography is beautiful both from the colour and texture point of view and also the intimacy of close-ups on long lenses. Some shots are immensely complicated but they make them look so easy.I'm sure you've all read that this is very much concentrating on the view from Elizabeth Bennet's eyes and this actually gives rise to enormous humour. It is not observational (as you so often find in costume drama), it is personal and intimate. I am so NOT a Keira fan but she does lend herself to this character beautifully and I do have to remind myself that she is so very young still and really does give a performance that shows experience and maturity (of technique - I'm not saying she appears too old for the part!).Matthew Macfadyen is wonderful and the way he is directed is so clever. For the first third of the film when Lizzie has dismissed him in her mind he is always just out of focus, wandering around in the background stealing glances of her and turning away as soon as she looks like she might see him.I am sure that Matthew's dialogue could be condensed to no more than 15 pages of script but in the way that so few actors are able, he coveys 20 more pages with a few moves of facial muscle or something in his gait. I would say that 60 per cent of his storyline is communicated without words and this is where Matthew is so incredible. He leaves you aching to help him. His Darcy is so vulnerable, so confused and so inadequate to the task of unravelling his emotions. He really does not know what to do with himself. He has such huge responsibilities which he takes so seriously and yet he is bewitched by this woman and lacks the experience to cope with it. The sadness in Matthew's eyes as he struggles to work out what he can do next to win her over (or even just contrive to look at her for five seconds) is so heart wrenching. The way his voice catches when he DOES have the chance to talk to her. This enormous great man, in both stature and standing, seems so very tiny in her presence.I can't finish this without giving huge mention to the pitch perfect performance (a lot of alliteration for an anxious anchorwoman - name that film!) of Tom Hollander. He almost steals the film and I had the uncontrollable shoulder shaking giggles at one of his scenes.I could tell you the best bits but they will be real spoilers. I envy anyone who is looking forward to seeing this for the first time.I keep telling people who have reservations about seeing the film exactly how funny it is and they immediately think I mean 'unintentionally funny'. It is SO intentionally funny and it's not like a regular costume drama at all. It's so tactile and enveloping.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best movie of 2005,"This beautiful movie did not receive the attention or screen time it deserved. Its extremely limited release in early November was followed by an only slightly more expanded release a couple of weeks later. Here in Phoenix, Arizona that release was short lived and can now only be seen on a few remaining screens. I own and watch regularly the A&E version and knew there would be comparisons. Sorry, but this film wins hands down. The chemistry between the characters and cinematography were second to none. And the soundtrack is awesome. I had to hunt high and low for it here, but it was worth the effort. I honestly believe there is a prejudice (no pun intended) here in this country about films produced in the UK. Look at how Phantom of the Opera was received here! I just wish I could express adequately my ""kudos"" to the people who obviously worked so hard on it. This film is the definitive answer to the question of whether we needed another version of Pride and Prejudice: Yes, a thousand times YES!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fabulous,"I LOVE the BBC version of this movie and own it. I've watched it over and over, so I was skeptical of this new version. But, I was pleasantly surprised to find it wonderful. The lead is phenomenal as well as Mr. Darcy, too. They are entirely different than Firth/El. and make this version fresh and brilliant. The filming is spectacular with breathtaking views of the English countryside as well as the grit of the ""poorer"" folks homes and barns/livestock. The actors compliment each other very well, although the goofy cousin is better in the BBC version---the newer version actor is not quite as odd and strange, although he plays his part very well. Go to see this movie, you won't regret it and IT IS NOT A CHICK FLICK--my husband thought it was well worth the $9.50 ticket price!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Benighted remake,"In Austen speak, I can but hope that the circumstances in which I found myself during the film did nothing to bring ill favour upon my good opinion of it. The blue rinse brigade talk more in the cinema than your average teenage hoody. ""Who is that?"", ""his cousin"" , ""look at that dress"", ""oh, a pig"". At least you can threaten kids. Any filmmaker that wants to make The Great Octogenarian Chainsaw Massacre will get my ticket stub. As it turned out, there was plenty to irritate by the film's own account.My main curiosity in seeing P&P again is whether it could possibly live up to my favourite scenes in the 95 Beeb production. Liz bennet's blistering refusal of Darcy's proposal and Lady Catherine De Bourg's incendiary assault in the apple orchard. As for the former, Darcy's opening words were drowned in thunderclaps. That's it, let's not bother with the dialogue. It's not important in an Austen production. IT'S THE TEMPEST OF THEIR INNER FEELINGS!!! Go, director. GO BABY! As for the latter, let's cut Lady Catherine's classic punchline. Who needs it?This version is curiously under-populated. It's use of passing light and shadow, mirror reflections and window blurrings suggests love as a waking dream of anticipation and uncertainty (no surprise when Darcy's big scene occurs at daybreak.) Although Austen's P&P has been said to be a comedy of manners, love as a moral force, in its ultimate sense as sacrifice, must also be of equal importance. The Wickham affair is central to it as Darcy is prepared to seriously humiliate himself before this man in order to win his true love. Without this he appears out of focus in the film, and the film without true gravity.The cast is okay although Hollander and Knightley appear to be using a certain production as a crib sheet. After the failure of Thunderbirds, perhaps hard nosed economics was the motivation behind Working Title's remake. Whether fair or not, that's why you leave the picture not really caring.",,Anonymous,Romance
An established Prejudice...,"As an avid admirer of Jane Austen and a long time lover of Pride and Prejudice, I was really nervous about how the Keira Knightly version would turn out. I've read the book dozens of times and seen the A&E version about as many.The new version definitely surprised me. I expected to want to run out of the theater, but instead, I enjoyed it and stayed through the end. Of course, to compare it to the A&E version is completely unfair. As a two hour film, it can't cover everything a six hour mini-series can. Some of the events and the way they happen have been changed for the sake of keeping the audience entertained.The biggest problem I had with the film is that it presented a very modern interpretation and took itself too seriously. Jane Austen's wit and satirical view of the society in which she lived didn't come across at all. Instead, the film aimed at modern sensibilities and lost the true essence of Austen. All in all, I would say this is a good summary, but if you want a more accurate portrayal, turn to the A&E version or read the book.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Viewed 3 times in 3 weeks!,"The first time I saw this movie(because Roger Ebert so highly recommended it), I loved the characters and photography, but since I hadn't read the book I was a little lost on some of the story details (""who is that red-headed woman? is she related to Mr. Darcy or Mr. Bingley?"" etc.). Immediately afterward, I purchased the paperback, read it that same weekend (saying, ""Oh! Now I get it!"" several times) and went back and saw it for a second time the next weekend. Then the third weekend I convinced my adult daughter to go with me, and she loved it too. I can hardly wait for the DVD to come out! Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfayden are splendid - there's just not enough on-screen time with the two of them in my opinion, but actually that's true to the book. We need more movies like this, and less of the profanity-filled trash that's so prevalent in the theaters now.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
must see,"First of all, let me say that this was the best movie I have seen in a long time. I looked at some of the comments others have left and I wonder how this movie could get such low remarks. Granted, I have not read the book or seen the earlier movie, but, perhaps that has not influenced me either way. I some ways I am glad I didn't, because, going into this particular movie I had no expectations of what this film was about. Let me say that it was beautiful, funny, sweet, and definitely worth seeing. I will be honest and say that the majority of the audience was female. Perhaps 90%-95%. Of the few men in the audience, the ones I could see were moved to tears in a few scenes. Whats wrong with men shedding a few tears?? Its good for them. So, with that said...PLEASE, if you want to be entertained for a couple of hours, go see this film. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Aloha",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Close - room for another version yet,"Oh, yes, you definitely get the impression that Lizzie and Darcy are 'thinkers' - the reason why they are so confounded my their emotional responses. (The pride and prejudice). This version very eloquently displays the different personalities of the Bennet sisters and the way they position themselves for mating purposes. Not sure Rosamund Pike was the right choice for Jane - was she really so beautiful that she could play 'ignorance' of her beauty? I don't think so here. Keira's performance is a bit mixed but there is no harm in that as, surely, this is what makes her most authentic in the role. Judi Dench is absolutely superb as Lady Catherine and conveys in very little time the difficulty the young Lizzie will have after she commits to Darcy. Fabulous. Brenda and Donald work a dream as the much tried parents. I laughed out loud several times - a fine story well told.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Perfect Representation of a Wonderful Story,"I liked this movie excessively. It has almost all the elements of a great movie (minus action); suspense, romance, humor, wit, and British accents. The cinematography is beautiful and the movie was excellently cast. Sometimes Kiera Knightly's mouth gets a bit annoying, with her big teeth and jutting chin, but she delivers the lines just as Elizabeth Bennett would, so one can forgive her for the affectation. I love all of the Jane Austen movies (Emma, Sense & Sensibility, Mansfield Park, etc.) but this is by far the best yet. The movie inspired me to read the book (which is very good) and the movie is mostly spot on with it, which makes me like the movie even more for its integrity. I highly recommend it (catch it on the big screen if you can).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Wonderfully shot, lovely adaptation","Having seen the BBC mini-series shot 10 years ago, I was really hoping that this adaptation would be just as good or better. Don't get me wrong, the mini-series was wonderful. The acting was great and so was the cinematography. But it was 6 hours long. Someone who wants to watch that needs to be really interested, or they will switch off half-way through the story.I was so happy that this new adaptation managed to capture the flavour of the book, without giving up too much. Sure, everyone complains when scenes are cut, but how else are you supposed to adapt a novel without making it 6 hours long? The main points of the story were there, although I agree some more of Wickham and Lydia's story would have made the point of why it was such a scandal more clear. It was successfully adapted to 2 hours. This means that newcomers to Jane Austen's wonderful novel won't be bored to tears by the end of it. Many people can not handle that much period at once.Besides the wonderful acting on everyone's part, the movie was exquisitely shot. I especially liked the shots where the camera wanders around the ball or house. It made it seem less like a movie, but more like an intimate look into what life was like. Needless to say, the costumes were wonderfully designed and beautifully made. I thought the dialogue, which stayed very true to the book when it could, was witty, interesting and made me laugh in all of the right places.All in all, I couldn't ask for a better 2-hour adaptation of a classic novel.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely wonderful,"Of course this is the best adaptation of a Jane Austen novel. When I watched it I couldn't believe the incredible job of the crew. Its art direction is very amazing, it is very well adapted to the age of XVIII century. Keira Knightley is shown here in her best performance ever. I hope that she wins the Oscar. All the other actors do a great Job, specialty Mathew Mcfyden and Jena Malone. The screenplay is absolutely perfect and very alike the original book. This movie truly deserves every award that is nominated for. It is one of the best movies ever made. I loved it. Everything on the movie was perfect.

A Film Can be Ruined by a Wig,"Keira Knightley was for some reason given a bad wig for this movie that left her with an undercut in the back, no part on top, and stringy strands hanging in her face for most of the film. In the far superior mini series, Lizzie's hair had tendrils in the front and was pinned back (like the other women in the film), which went with the fashion of empire waist nightgown style dresses in light colors. This film got the style of the era very, very wrong and thought the audience was dumb enough not to be distracted by a cheap wig on a young girl who certainly would not have had Wish or Shein to order such a wig from. The series' costuming properly shows a time when women were pious (crosses around their necks), fertile (maternity waistlines on trend), and pure (whites and light colors).The poor costuming ruined this film for me, along with the miscasting of Keira Knightley who was way too cocky for Lizzie. Lizzie is meant to be cheeky but in a very demure way. All this subtly is lost on Keira Knightley among beautiful, meaningly tableaus.",,Anonymous,Romance
I assume they tried their best!,"In the music industry there are some records that should never be 'covered', that is to say sung by another artist. This is because the first or an earlier version was just too good. I am one of many who has seen the 1995 Firth & Ehle version of Pride & Prejudice and I just thought that it would be difficult for that version to be matched especially in less than half the time. Maybe I myself am, dare I say it prejudiced however I can also say that I have read the book and here is where the film lacks consistently when the 1995 version did not.The excellent language and turn of phrase brought forth by Jane Austen is missing and then some of the phrases are said out of order and some are said by the wrong character. Also for the sake of time some of the characters in the book was missing from the 1995 version(although this did not diminish the story) but for some strange reason the Knightley version added a character, to own the truth Mr Hill. WHY? All he did was put some food on the table.I assume that because of time sub plots could not be developed for example Wickhams true's nature,Lydia's flirtations and the hatred all of the Bennett family had towards Mr Darcy. Having said all of the above I believe the actors worked well with the material they had to work with and I dare say that a person who has not read the book or seen the 1995 version would have found this film quite diverting.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Awesome Movie!,"I absolutely love this movie! It is way better than the book. The greatest love story put into a movie. A great chick-flick! Kiera Knightley brings Elizabeth Bennet to life. Awesome movie, one to be watched again and again. Matthew Macfadyen conveys Mr.Darcy so well, he is exactly how I think Jane Austen thought him to be. Donald Sutherland plays Mr. Bennet to the t. He is so incredibly funny! Lady Catherine only needed black and white hair and she could have passed for another Cruella DeVil! I mean no offense to Judi Dench who played the mean lady very well. The other actors and actresses did a marvelous job at their prospective rolls as well. If you get the chance, see the movie, but don't let my opinion sued you.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Sweet, but it isn't Jane!","To start with, I am a Janeite: I have read Pride and Prejudice at least a half-dozen times, and enjoyed it every time. This may be a disqualification for viewing this movie, because, delightful as it is, it isn't really Jane. I agree with almost all the comments regarding the casting and acting, which have been highly praised. The combination of edgy beauty and intelligence make Kiera Knightly almost the only choice for Elizabeth Bennet, Sutherland and Blethyn as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are superb -- both are actually better than Austen's originals -- Sutherland suggests the weariness, the remoteness, the despair of the father, and Blethyn grounds the vulgar eagerness of the mother in real social and economic hope and despair. The three youngest sisters fill their roles very well, being nearly as insufferable on the screen as they would be in real life. Bingley and Jane are well-portrayed, he as an amiable doofus, she as a sweet, long-suffering girl, yet capable of deep feeling. Mr. Collins is sublime: I am sorry that there was not more of his pervy absurdity. Caroline Bingley is something of a one-note character, but well done. Mr. Darcy, however. The actor does what he can with the role, but he is, I think, wrong for it -- I think anyone who does not look like a young Olivier is wrong for the role. An imposing physical presence ('tall' is not enough) is an absolute requirement. Olivier had it in the 1940 film (its one bright spot). Firth had it in the 1995 TV version. This film doesn't have either actor, and thus falls short. Lacking an obvious reason for his conviction of superiority, he seems to be a mere snob. The worst acting and directing lapse, however, is from a direction you would never suspect. Dame Judy Dench is wrong-wrong-wrong for Lady Catherine de Bourgh. She is too dignified, serious, and intelligent-seeming to play the imperious buffoon, Lady Catherine. Actor-proof part, one would think, but I think Dench missed it, because there is too much cynical wisdom in her glance, where a lighter-weight actor would have made it a gem. The chap playing Wickham - did anyone else notice? - looked exactly like Orlando Bloom. I suppose you've made it when they start casting your clones. The art direction was splendid - and original - in the interiors. The messy, shabby Bennet house, cheek-to-jowl with the cowbarn, frigid Netherfield Park, the crowded assembly-rooms at the Meryton ball, all captured the period, and more important, the sense of social distinction, of the period. Though Lizzie Bennet tells Lady C. 'Mr. Darcy is an English gentleman, my father is an English gentleman; thus far we are equal.' The movie undercuts this to such an extent that the line, famous as it is, is not used. One sees Darcy's point. In the outdoor scenes, the art direction was equally splendid, in a postcardy sort of way. Did Mr. Darcy really have to emerge from the morning mist? But in the end it's the writing that makes the movie, and it's the writing that invalidates this as a definitive 'Pride and Prejudice'. Some choices were just stupid: Lizzie's description of her sister Jane as 'shy' is dead wrong - no one in the period would have used the word that way, and Jane isn't shy anyway, in the sense of 'socially inept'; what she is is modest, placid, even-tempered, good-natured, and, perhaps to compensate for her mother and sisters, not given to trumpeting her affections from the roof-tops. A very short speech to this effect would have worked, perhaps pointing out that men of Mr. Darcy's stripe demand just the qualities in a woman that Jane displays, and to dismiss her as unfeeling when she displays them is deeply unjust. I should point out that when the script and the direction turn to Jane, as in Lizzie's scene with Mr. Bennet after Darcy's proposal, it works perfectly. Is it possible that Miss Austen knew what she was doing all along,",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
If you want to see one awful film this year ...,"From the film's first shot - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn, thus invoking all the clichés cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character in period drama - I knew I was in for something to make me want to kill myself.Joe Wright seemed not only to have not read the book, but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact Jane Austen's subtle, nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling, delicate social interaction in eighteenth century English drawing-rooms, but a sort of U-certificate Wuthering Heights. Thus we were treated to every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason, in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain. Not to mention that Jane Austen, and in particular P & P, is not about passion, sexual tension or love. It's about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society. Which was completely ignored, so that the Bennets' house was a rambunctious, chaotic place where everybody shouts at once, runs around, leaves their underwear on chairs, and pigs wander happily through the house; the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a Matrix Reloaded style dance-orgy; and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety.The genius of Jane Austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety, and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap. So both the brilliance of Jane Austen and the very factor that allows her plots - particularly in this film - to function was completely erased. Subtlety in general was nowhere int his film, sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances.It was so obviously trying to be a *serious* film. The humour - which IS Pride & Prejudice, both Austen's methodology and her appeal - was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po-faced melodrama, and when it was allowed in, was handled so clumsily. Pride & Prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points, yes, but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour, they are embedded in it. You can't lose Jane Austen's technique, leaving only the bare bones of the story, and expect the themes to remain. Not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy-handed mystical-numinous fauxbrow cinematography.Elizabeth Bennett is supposed to be a woman, an adult, mature and sensible and clear-sighted. Keira Knightley played the first half of the film like an empty-headed giggling schoolgirl, and the second half like an empty-headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine. Elizabeth's wit, her combative verbal exchanges, her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody's follies including her own, her strength and composure, and her fantastic clear-sightedness were completely lost and replaced with ... what? A lot of giggling and staring into the distance? Rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs, she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation - and not genuinely raging, either; no, these were petulant hissy fits. And where the great strength of Austen's Elizabeth (at least in Austen's eyes) was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety, Knightley's Elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention. Furthermore, she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong-minded, and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it. An astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance. In which quest for blandness and weakness, she was ably matched by Matthew Macfayden.Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet seemed weak, ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes Mr Bennet so fascinating and tragic. His special bond with Lizzie, as the only two sensible people in a world of fools, was completely lost, not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools, and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact. Mr Bingley was no longer amiable and well-meaning to the point of folly, but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs, and the woman who was playing Jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all. The script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of Jane Austen - delivered with remarkable clumsiness - and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy.Just get the BBC adaptation on DVD and save yourself the heartache.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Completely satisfied,"Pride and Prejudice. What a beautiful movie. It was absolutely better than the 1995 version; the best version I've seen so far.Keira Knightly: Elizabeth Bennet. She is incredible. She radiates simple beauty, classy acting, and subtle confidence.Matthew Macfayden: Mr. Darcy. I fell in love with him. Not because of his looks, or even his personality. Because he portrayed a love-sick high-class man of honor. He was absolutely phenomenal. You can't watch this movie and not fall in love with him.Kelly Reilly and Simon Woods: The Bingleys. My face lit up whenever the took the screen. They were fantastic.The casting. The costumes. The scenery. This movie was a work of art.

This film was, for me, tremendous because it PUT ME IN THE MOMENT.I was living in that time, with those people, with the sounds and the spaces and the colors and the light.To begin with, this film finally got me to grok this English thing about the difference between the middle and the UPPER classes. The film begins by introducing you to the small crowded rooms and noisy goings on of a 5-girl middle class family.Later you will be shown the astounding austere spaciousness and silence of a very upper class abode.Socially, the dichotomy continues to be shown with the loud , merry,crowded middle class country ball v.s. the silent, low-toned restrained and awkward conversations in the drawing rooms of the wealthy. While their worlds are opposite in most ways, the main characters,Elizabeth and Darcy, are both frank, stubborn, head strong, secretive and loyal to those they love.Their relationship,the continual pulse of their push and pull, is the heartbeat of this enthralling film.The acting, every single performance, is spot-on, and the chemistry between the 2 leads is truly provocative and compelling.

"A fantastic movie- and that's what it is, a movie, not a book or miniseries","People, please, quit sniping about how this movie isn't ""true enough"" to the book or doesn't match up to the miniseries.I'm certainly an admirer of the miniseries, but a film that has six hours to tell a story isn't going to be the same thing as a two-hour film. As for the book, never read it, but I also think that a movie has absolutely no obligation to be loyal to source material, only to be as strong a movie as it can be.Is this movie overly romantic and passionate when compared to the book? Perhaps. But as a romantic film, it is superb. Knightley is mesmerizing on screen. Not just her beauty, but the life she brings to the whole movie. I do hope she receives an Oscar nomination. The supporting players are all fantastic, particularly Sutherland, whose final scene with Knightley is as warm and happy a scene as I can think of in a while, invoking for me a similar scene with Denholm Elliot and Helena Bonham-Carter scene near the end of ""A Room With a View"". The whole movie is about happiness, and the happiness of its characters. Its goal is to make you care about them and their happiness, and by the end, it's as warm and joyful a movie as you'll see this year.Does it please Austen-ites? It doesn't matter, if their judgment is by how loyal it is to the book. It's just a plain great movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent 2005 viewpoint,"I was thoroughly pleased with the 2005 version of P&P! The story moves along much more quickly than the BBC Jennifer Ehle/Colin Firth version, and while both are excellent, I really enjoyed the atmosphere of P&P 2005. The class distinction was much more pronounced in 2005. In the BBC version, I never had a feeling of ""poverty"". This was displayed interestingly in this movie! Most of my comments have been covered in previous posts...my only complaint is with Lydia and Kitty. Much of the time their screeching and giggling masked the dialogue. I particularly enjoyed Brenda Blethyn's version of Mrs. Bennet, as I understood her motivation much better than the BBC's..she seemed to me more ""flittered"". I loved Matthew MacFayden's shy interpretation of Fitzwilliam Darcy. Although I truly loved Colin Firth's interpretation, there was rarely a glimpse of his softer side. His was a stiff performance, in my opinion, and I believe Matthew MacFayden gave a subtle yet provocative view on the multi-faceted Mr. Darcy. Dame Judi Dench was, as always, impeccable and although Keira Knightly was good as Lizzie, I don't think she was ideal..yet she gave me a different view than the rather haughty interpretation of Jennifer Ehle.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not for Purists!!,"As a devoted fan of both the book and the BBC adaptation I went to see this new version more out of a feeling that I should before I trash it than an actual belief that it would be good. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised.Despite a personal dislike of Kiera Knightly, she did pull off a good performance. She did share with the audience more of Elizabeth's emotions than Jennifer Ehrle did, but perhaps she went a little too far. Brenda Blethyn and Judi Dench were lovely, dare I say it better than the BBC castings for Mrs Bennet and Lay Catherine. Jenna Malonwas also very good, though her accent was not perfect!As for the men,it was a poorer showing. Matthew MacFaydon was sadly disappointing. I loved him in Spooks, and was hoping that he would make an to be convincing. Perhaps he should stick to thrillers... Neither Bingly nor Wickham really managed to capture the part. Bingly especially, came off too silly to be believable. (Wickham just looked far to like Orlando Bloom!)What did really catch my eye was the directing and cinematography. I loved the creative way that the camera was used to convey time passing and significant devlopments in people's emotions. It is worth seeing this film for that.To sum up... This is not ever going to be a good version for the purists among you. Two hours is just not enough time to do Austen justice. Some of the subtleties of class and emotion have been expanded to make it clearer what is happening and why, so therefore it is more accessible to the Pride and Prejudice virgin than the BBC version. But like I said, it's not for purists.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the Most Delightful and Beautiful Romances I Have Ever Seen,"In Georgian England, Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) raises her five daughters  Jane (Rosamund Pike), Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), Mary (Talulah Riley), Kitty (Carey Mulligan) and Lydia (Jena Malone) with the purpose of getting married with a rich husband that can support the family. They are not from the upper class, and their house in Hartfordshire will be inherited by a distant cousin if Mr. Bennet dies. When the wealthy bachelor Mr. Bingley and his best friend Mr. Darcy arrive in town to spend the summer in a mansion nearby their property, the shy and beautiful Jane falls in love for Mr. Bingley, and Lizzie finds Mr. Darcy a snobbish and proud man, and she swears to loathe him forever. This is the beginning of their wonderful love story.On the cover of the DVD ""Pride & Prejudice"" it is highlighted that it is ""the best film of the year"". I dare to say that this movie is one of the most delightful romances I have ever seen, and a perfect movie in every aspect. The story is intense, picturing a period of England history with a strong fight of classes and rules of society and people being categorized in different categories, trying to climb to upper classes through marriage. The screenplay is very well written and shows this period in a very consistent way. The direction of Joe Wright is simply stunning, and the long sequence of the ball is one of the most perfect I have ever seen in a movie. The top-notch performance of the cast is amazing, and the gorgeous Keira Knightley has my respects as an excellent actress, and not only a pretty face on the big screen. I am impressed with the exponential progress of the career of this British actress, who was nominated to the Oscar for her performance in the strong character of Lizzie. The Art Direction, Costume Design and Music Score deserved also the nomination to the Oscar. I have just included this movie in the list of my favorite movies ever. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Orgulho e Preconceito"" (""Pride and Prejudice"")",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Light entertaining romance,"I really enjoyed the setting, costumes and actors in this film. The fact that the setting did not seem contrived added to the believability of the film. The atmosphere and landscape were wonderfully captured by the photographer. I admit the lower rating I gave to the film was due to the occasional confusion that took place trying to figure out which of the many characters were being discussed. If the length of the film would have allowed, I would have preferred a slightly longer film in order to fully develop the characters. The occasional tension between some of the characters seemed too short to be believable. Some of the film's outcome was predictable. Perhaps if I had not seen the original film, my criticism would be less.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
My absolute favorite,"I still can't believe what an impact this movie has left on me! Maybe one of the reasons is because I am such a big fan of Jane Austen and her novels, but I believe this is only a small part of ma affection towards this movie. The cast is amazing, the locations are beautiful and the atmosphere of the entire movie is simply wonderful. I love the way everything seems so natural. It seems as if someone with a camera traveled back in time and shot things just as they were 200 years ago. Although the movie is considered to be long, it is only normal for a novel adaptation. I personally wished for the movie never to end. Although it is a romantic story, it is not a classical chick-flick. I strongly recommend this movie to simply everyone. You'll love it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pride and Prejudice 2005 unnecessary,"I see that Netflix, in August, 2023, is advertising the 2005 ""Pride and Prejudice"" adaptation as earthy and sensual. That one was on the bottom of my collection of Pride and Prejudice movies, which starts with the romantic Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson version in 1940 where everyone worries far more about the civility of their behavior and delicacy of their feelings than anything else in their lives, including the Napoleonic wars. Darcy and Elizabeth consumed with passion and motivated by lust;? Actually, the farthest they go in this 2005 production is some heavy breathing. I remember however a reviewer claiming ridiculously that Darcy is motivated by his all consuming lust for Elizabeth. But Netflix doesn't understand that those who have respected and adored this novel for several centuries have actually read it, and that's absolutely not what they get out of it; I'm pretty sure that Ms. Austen would have fainted at the thought of a sensual Elizabeth, or one that so much as exposed a naked ankle to any male to whom she was not married or related.Okay, I'm older, and I'm mortally tired of ""pushing the envelope"". How about you label some productions as entirely suitable for those who long to replace traditional standards of art and beauty with 400 pound naked female twerkers claiming to be the new standard of female beauty?",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Squalor not ""realistic"" Austen","There are many, including prominent professional critics, who commend this adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"" for its ""realistic"" portrayal of dirt, unkempt clothes and hair, farm animals wallowing in the living room, etc. In fact, it is not only historically unauthentic, it is false to Jane Austen. There were no such scenes of squalor included in the novel. To the contrary, Austen wrote a passage in which Elizabeth Bennet sets out on a long walk after a rain storm to visit her ailing sister, during which she soils the hem of her skirt with mud. This slight soiling results in a small amount of embarrassment for Elizabeth, who tries to let down her outer garment to hide it, and a great amount of derision behind her back by two nasty female residents of the house she is visiting. Had dirt and shabbiness been the norm in households like Elizabeth's at the time depicted, it is unlikely a little mud on the edge of a skirt would have attracted anyone's notice or rude commentary, and these events in the book would have made no sense. The fact that Austen wrote such a scene and had the characters behave as they do indicates that cleanliness and neatness of dress were normal and expected at that place and time, among that class of people.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
My new favorite movie,"Alright well I've seen that some other people have given really harsh reviews for this movie. But as long as you're not going to sit and critically analyze whether or not everything is perfectly historically accurate you should love the movie. If you've read the novel you will see that some parts are left out, but it's not very damaging to the story line. Matthew MacFadyen does a great job playing Mr. Darcy, I think he really portrayed the character correctly. This is one of those movies that by the time you get to the end of the movie you can't help but grinning. I went out on a limb and randomly bought the movie just because I had read the novel and it was worth every single penny. This is definitely a must see and is now one of my favorite movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Great Movie With Character Development,"I admit I was skeptical about how this movie would turn out, as the book has so much rich material, and 2 hours and 7 minutes demands a lot of adaptation to cover the essence of the story; which is the problems which arise between people who pre-judge others or jump to conclusions and then proceed to characterize everything that comes later in a bad light. What a tangled mess it becomes; but what a great story watching the emotional growth of the lead characters.I thought the casting was absolutely wonderful. I have been so hooked on Colin Firth since seeing the 1995 series, that I was certain I would not like MacFadyen's character as much. But, I was wrong. He was up to the task and brought a new dimension to Darcy, that of a proud man who was socially a bit inept due to taking on a huge burden at an early age.Keira Knightly was also excellent as Lizzie Bennet. I actually liked the pairing of Knightly and MacFadyen better than Ehle and Firth. Although Jennifer Ehle was an excellent actress in the 1995 version, she appeared too old to be 20 years old and too matronly in some of her dresses to give credibility to the restrained passion of the story. I guess I preferred the youthful casting which seemed more like the book.The music score was outstanding in this version, and the dance scenes at the opening assembly were terrific.I highly recommend this version as an addition to your P&P library. Of course, I still will watch the 5 hour BBC-A&E version when I want to see the entire story and characters, plus to get refueled for my Firth addition.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
thoroughly entertaining...,"I had very low expectations for this movie, after all, what could measure up to the 1995 mini series...? However, i was pleasantly surprised, the movie retains all the wit of Austen whilst brining the story forward to todays audience. Mcfadyen brought an entirely different meaning to the character of Darcy, making the audience believe he is a character trapped in a personality not his own, but what he feels he must portray to society. Knightly was the best I've ever seen her, she sparkled as a youthful and headstrong Elizabeth, inquisitive in every look and intelligent in every word.Not to be compared to the fantastic 1995 mini series, this adaptation was beautifully acted and directed in an entirely new and refreshing fashion.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Masterful Cinema,"Jane Austen's classic novel about a young poor woman who falls in love with a rich man is masterfully crafted as one of the best love stories to hit cinema in a very long time. The story crosses the boundaries of Victorian England to be ever pertinent in today's society as it portrays relationships among different classes. Keira Knightly gives the finest performance of her career portraying the strong willed Elizabeth Bennet. Outstanding performances resonate throughout this film, most notably by Matthew Macfadyen, Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn. But it is more than a beautiful and honest love storyit is film-making at its most breathtaking. The cinematography by Roman Oshin is lavish throughout with its continuous shots that had to be meticulously choreographed. The dialogue of the screenplay is taken almost directly from Austen's book and is a fine representation of the era. Even the musical score by Dario Marianelli adds to the greatness of this moving and comical love story that was so finely directed by Joe Wright. It is the year's most delightful film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Time to watch movie, instead reading novel","Jane Auston's Pride and Prejudice has never been my favourite novel but this movie is certainly marvellous. To make a movie on a well-read book is quite a difficult task. The producer and director have to fulfill the expectations of the reader. In other words, film should depict characters and locations as the reader of the book expected them to be. It is quiet a task. So, usually, I don't see movies based on great novels or dramas. Generally , for me, they depict something different than my concept of the character. But this movie is not one of them. This movie gave me the features to my blurry concempt of characters and locations. It enhanced rather confirmed my imagination of the characters.Nearlly every actor of the movies is quite suitable to his or her character.Cinematography is charming. Kiera is brilliant in the character of Lizzy and Mathew is convincing as Darcy. Though sometimes I felt the script a bit sketchy but I know that they cannot bundle every detail of the novel in a movie of 127 minutes. Now I am thinking to change my opinion about the films based on novel. A must see for the lovers of Classics! I give it 7 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Romance
Discard the film; read the book,"I have to admit that I have not seen the BBC famous 'Colin Firth/Mr Darcy wet shirt scene' that everyone seems to rave on about, so in this respect, I went into the cinema with fresh eyes and perspective. I have, however, read the novel. Twice. And loved it. So in my eyes the film had a lot to live up to. Insome respects, Pride and Prejudice was excellent: a truly 'feel-good'film. I loved the realism and the beauty which has been captured is breathtaking- notably the opening scenes and where Elizabeth was stood on the cliff, with her cape billowing around her. In the cinema, I became immersed in the story (as opposed to l'ennui of 'Mansfield Park', another Austen adaptation) and for the most part, Wright did an excellent job of translating the book to the big screen. After all, who can argue that the ball scene between Elizabeth Bennet and Darcy(where as they intertwine, the others disappear) isn't wonderfully done? Some of the cast did full justice to the characters- such as Tom Hollander as Mr. Collins and Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennet. The latter's performance was so good that it has inspired me to re-read the novel for the third time and she really made the role her own. Such performances really did make the film.However, if only I could give such a glowing account for the two leads. Keira Knightley. What a mistake. She misinterpreted the wit, the sharp sarcastic edge of Elizabeth Bennet. The character was more 'giggly' than feisty; it was impossible to believe in her; we were not seeing Elizabeth Bennet, but Keira Knightley PLAYING Elizabeth Bennet. You could not get beyond the actress. Knightley was simply too interested in pouting her lips and 'looking pretty', thus delivering a somewhat wooden performance. She lacked the subtlety, the finer nuances which convince us, the audience, to empathise (which appears to be a problem in her other films, such as 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' or 'Bend it Like Beckham'). Matthew MacFadyen? A disappointment. I had seen him in 'The Way We Live Now' and frankly, I prefer him as the cad Felix Carbury. I believe MacFadyen (from other performances such as 'Maybe Baby') to be a promising actor, and certainly much more versatile than Knightley, but here the character was again misinterpreted and a construct, rather than a believable being. I couldn't engage with him in the same way that I could with Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennet, who to be fair, out shadowed him (!) Coupled with this was the irregularity of the plot and a villain who was more insipid than villainous. Key events were glossed over and condensed so that the audience gradually felt 'hang on, why's this going on here'? Perhaps less time should have been devoted to artistic beauty and more energy consecrated in plot and character development. Or Wright could have taken a leaf from Peter Jackson's book and done both (!)Ultimately,the film's shortcomings were due to a lack of chemistry between the leads and miscasting of Knightley and MacFadyen. Furthermore, the overly slushy, sugar coated interpretation did not do justice to Austen's original. It lacked the grit, the substance, the challenging nature of the novel. Doesn't it say it all that until I chanced upon this page I had forgotten that I had even seen it? A 'nice' (and how I loathe that word- but it suits this vehicle perfectly), feel-good film in it's own right, but lacks the impact of the book. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Alright movie for a mediocre novel.,"Overall, the Pride and Prejudice novel is well portrayed through the use of film. The Pride and Prejudice movie used frames in a very unique manner, making for very intriguing and entertaining cinematography. As for characters, Mr. Collins and Mrs. Bennet were very annoying, however, I viewed this to be an accurate portrayal of their character, possibly even better portrayed than in the novel. I feel as though the novel did a rather poor job of depicting the sheer disturbance to others caused by Collins and Bennet when contrasted with the movie. Another thing I found intriguing about the movie was the use of dark color, especially when used in outfits. Mr. Darcy for example, frequently wore vampire-esc clothing, which helped portray his mysterious character. When contrasted with Colonel Fitzwilliam, who frequently wore light colors, you can get a good sense of the importance of color in the film. Overall, Jane Austin is an extraordinarily overrated and mediocre author, and Joe Wright is a talented director, who understands the importance of mystery and unspoken details when creating a film.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Lovely beyond words...a colossal, monumental gift from Austen and company to the known world","Elizabeth Bennett (Keira Knightley) is the second of five daughters, all single and young. When a new man moves into the neighborhood, all of the girls take notice. Mr. Bingley is quite rich and handsome enough, after all. At the first large party for area folks, Mr. Bingley comes to the festivity with his sister and the proud Mr. Darcy in toe. Bingley has his eye on Elizabeth's beautiful sister Jane while Mr. Darcy neither dances or talks to anyone. Although unacknowledged, however, Mr. Darcy is transfixed by Elizabeth and she is strangely drawn to him. Through a series of town meetings, country visits, and more, Elizabeth and Darcy meet again...and again. There is something stirring. Is is disgust or is it love?This classic story could not be presented better than it is this film. It is utterly lovely in every aspect, every way. The performers are just outstanding, with Knightley giving Elizabeth the fire, the mind, the sensitivity that make her such an appealing person. Mr. McF is to sigh and cry over as his Darcy is handsome, in possession of a arresting voice, and provides a display of the great depth of his own sensitive nature. The costumes and scenery are colossally stunning, as is the editing, the script (most of it is Austen's own words), and anything else that makes a movie this beautiful. Do not let another day go by before you buy a ticket or arrange any other method to watch this film. When the credits roll, your mouth will drop open in admiration as you utter that single word, ""Wow!""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A giggling Elizabeth?,"This movie was a fairly good interpretation of Jane Austen's novel. HOWEVER. Elizabeth played by K. Knightley was a terrible mistake. While I think she is a terrific actress, she did not represent the intelligent, bright, and thoughtful Elizabeth Bennet we have all come to admire in Pride and PRejudice. She was just like all the sisters, giggling, smiling too much, licking her fingers (in a Jane Austen movie?) and displayed a harshness and a mean disposition against her mother and the captain. It is completely against her character in the novel, where Elizabeth is practical, genuine, and very different than all the other women consumed by the need for a wealthy husband, which is precisely why Darcy falls in love with her. Darcy was perfect, Jane was perfect, Mr. Bennet, however was nothing of a gentleman... If you liked the book, and the movie version with Colin Firth you will be disappointed in this version, if not, you will enjoy this romantic and fairy tale like story.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
It doesn't get any more romantic than this...,"""Pride & Prejudice"" was quite easily the most pleasant cinematic surprise I've had in ages. It is easily the most romantic film of the year and it may just be the best.Brits often complain about the repetitive nature of Hollywood formula pictures. They make a valid point despite the obscenely hypocritical tone that tends to accompany it. You see, Brits seem churn out the same seven movies over and over again...Shakespeare adaptation. Elizabethan drama. WWII drama. Literary biopic. British gangster flick. Python-esquire silliness with comedian-du-jour. Austen adaptation.Now, don't get me wrong. They make some truly wonderful films. But their range isn't too daring. They have failed to match the American independent scene in terms of originality, daring and experimentation.So when yet another Jane Austen adaptation comes down the pike, you'll forgive me if I tend to roll my eyes let out a weary sigh.The only thing that peaked my interest for this recent version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" was the inclusion of Keira Knightley as the beloved Elizabeth Bennet and Rosamund Pike as the eldest Bennet sister, Jane. Knightley and Pike are two of the loveliest and most talented young actresses of this generation and I was curious to see them try their hands with this poetic material.So with all my trepidation in tact, fully expecting to see a respectable but nonetheless uninspired British period piece, I sat down to watch director Joe Wright's version of the classic tale.Within thirty seconds of the opening, I knew I was in for something unexpectedly refreshing. I had a smile on my face for the next two hours, fully enthralled with the witty trials and tribulations of the Bennet's family struggle to marry off their five daughters to respectable husbands.Austen's prose shines through each and every pore of this film. Keira Knightley and company wrap their skills around every meaningful word and subtle glance in ways that will have attentive and literate fans bursting with delight. It is a delicate, complex and intricate script that will leave the witless behind in a wake of confusion.WARNING: The next bit of gushing will make this very heterosexual critic sound more gay than a Wyoming Cowboy in heat.This version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" made my heart soar. I wanted to hug and kiss everyone in the audience, except for that fat guy in the third row. If Keira Knightley's firecracker performance doesn't have you cheering, perhaps the heartbreaking strings and rolling piano scales of Dario Marianelli's wonderfully romantic score will have you in tears.Perhaps Bingley's eventual drop to one knee will send shivers down your spine. Maybe Mr. Darcy strolling majestically through the morning mist toward his true love will have you weak at the knees.Maybe the anguish of Mrs. Bennet's nerves will resonate. Or the kindly recognition of Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennet will leave you warm inside.Will the playful interaction of Elizabeth and Jane under the covers as they wistfully dream of true love touch your heart?Will Elizabeth's journey to the edge of a cliff or the spinning solitude of a barnyard swing have your heart aching for a resolution?I don't know what will touch you the most... But rest assured, something in this film will move you. If it doesn't, consider yourself emotionally numb.This is a film for utter romantics. It is a film for connoisseurs of literary elegance and sly wit. These characters spar in verbal gymnastics that will leave your head spinning.If Jane Austen's legendary love story is the engine to this film, Keira Knightley is the fuel. Her performance in the best of the year... from either sex. She bursts from restrained to rambunctious, elegant grandeur to rugged determination. She handles the part like a seasoned veteran who eats Shakespearean dialogue for breakfast. To paraphrase the man, she is more lovely and more temperate than a summer's day, imbuing the silver screen with the darling buds of May.See, I told you this would sound gay!But I don't care. This is the kind of film that can make you feel like that... like love is all that matters in the grand scheme of things.""Pride & Prejudice"" is the best film of 2005. It is certainly the most romantic. If you are in that mode where you just need a break from all the typical British period pieces... trust me... take a look at this one. It blows them all away, virtually reinventing the genre... certainly revitalizing it. I had no earthly idea that I would find love in this story... a sentiment shared by the beautiful Lizzie Bennet.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Phenomenal Cast,"First of all, I must say that I have not seen the oldest production of Pride and Prejudice...only the one with Firth and this one. I am rather torn of which of the two are better.First, the length is to be spoken of. When I first saw the previews for this movie I was instantly excited but then quickly realized than in the normal length of feature films, there is no way that they could cover good ground. It would have to be at least as long as Titanic or Pearl Harbor (3 hours+) to even touch all the important points. I realize that the oldest of two had the luxury of episodes and that most people would not have gone to see a 6 hour long movie. However, I found that there were times in the movie in which they wasted time. I sat there thinking...STOP...you have so much ground to cover, keep it moving. And though I know the reason, I thought it was insufficient. In order to balance, I found they spoke way too fast and moved too quickly from scene to scene. You are hardly getting the point of the past scene before they are headed into the next. Pace should be thought of and considered...Next, was the casting. I have to say that, for the most part, the casting was excellent. In fact, I have little criticism at all. I didn't like Wickam. I thought he looked too much like a Backstreet Boy or something. That's just my opinion. But Matthew and Keira did beautifully. I even like that Matthew was a bit warmer than Firth. He played more of a shy, socially awkward type instead of cold and arrogant. Donald Sutherland was genius, and Judy Dench was amazing. Even Poor Mr. Collins was a perfect match! I laughed every time he was in the shot.All in all, I thought this was an awesome movie with a phenomenal cast. And I guess my only criticism of it was that it didn't use its time wisely. When you have so much ground to cover, don't idle with nonsensical takes.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Bewitched, Body and Soul","Greetings again from the darkness. Get ready guys, the theater will be filled with fantastical women. The Cinderella story has always fascinated (tortured is probably more accurate) woman who think the handsome, rich prince will rescue them by falling in love at a glance and begging them to live in his giant castle. This is so much more romantic and efficient than actually getting to know someone! That said, Jane Austen was a master of creating the love story. Her dialog was light years ahead of its time. First, lovers of her books must understand that you will probably be disappointed by comparing the book to the movie. Two hours is a short time to cram in the details of subtlety of Ms. Austen's writing. Secondly, casting is key and this film surprises.Keira Knightley was selected (amidst protests from dedicates of the novel). Many know Knightley from her breakout role in ""Bend it like Beckham"" and the few of us who saw her in this years' ""Domino"" couldn't help be surprised at her ability to handle the demanding role of Miss Elizabeth Bennett. No question, she has the eyes and smile to handle the first half of the film, but her effectiveness for the second half could be debated.Relative unknown actor (at least in the U.S.) Matthew MacFadyen wins the lottery with his casting as Mr. Darcy. MM has the necessary ability to stand tall and not smile. He fails a bit in the romantic moments, but most women-viewers will have swallowed the hook and will not even notice.Screen veterans Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland (not really a Brit) are fine in their paternal roles and it is always nice to see the underused Jena Malone - even when cast as the slightly off center sister. And of course, no actor spews venom with the fierceness of Dame Judy Densch.Not sure how Joe Wright was selected for the director spot on this film, but he does an admirable job of filming the beauty of the countryside and capturing the pageantry of the parties. Those not familiar with the times, may be a bit surprised at the lack of color in the clothes, but Mr. Wright went for accuracy.Screen film versions of classical works will always disappoint those seeking perfection, but this one will definitely please the casual viewer and reader.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Loved the film,"While visiting Bath for the Jane Austen Festival, I had the pleasure of seeing the new P&P not only once but a second time. I cannot wait to view it many more times. The concept of a film based on the book allows for additional visual information conveyed by facial expressions, body language, and camera angles. I have always wondered just when Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett first had feelings for each other. After each viewing of the earlier versions, both the television series and the earlier film, I have gone back to the book to see just what Jane Austen really wanted us to believe. But the book is full of dialogue and little explanation of inner feelings. I think the movie did an excellent job of conveying the real people that we know in the story. Jane was especially well done. It is not easy to be an interesting person who is just ""nice"" even if very lovely to look at. This movie gave more life to her character. Also, the mother is portrayed in a much more reasonable fashion than in the TV series. She is a more sympathetic character. Now I eagerly await its arrival in the US.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mixed review,"I understand what they were trying to do with this film, provide a more modern interpretation of Austen's famous book.They fell short because they hacked Elizabeth's dialog. Instead of being witty, sharp and playful, she comes off as slightly shrewish and spoiled. Elizabeth's talent (which she shared with her creator, Jane Austen) is the ability to put the pompous down without them understanding what she was doing or saying . She also didn't take herself too seriously.I disagree with the reviewer who said to chill, that only a little of the dialog was changed. Not so, a lot of the dialog was tampered with, for no good reason.A few examples: Why did Lady Catherine make the comment about using the piano in the servants quarters to Charlotte instead of Elizabeth as it was written? It sets the tone for their relationship.The first proposal scene. By removing so much of the dialog between Darcy and Elizabeth, the humor AND the outrage is dimmed. It is hard to appreciate why Elizabeth is so insulted, other than she is mad about his role in the Bingley/Jane affair.The reunion at Pemberly. Why was she wandering around poking in doors, where was the housekeeper? By not allowing Darcy and Elizabeth to see each other face to face, the shock they both feel is lost. Where did the Gardners go? They play an important part in that scene. This is the first time Elizabeth sees a reformed Darcy being civil to her companions.The final proposal scene. I have no problem with Elizabeth going out in her nightgown and running in to Darcy. However why the Fabio like slow mo of Darcy with the swelling music? I did like the affection between the Bennets. I thought the final scene with Mr. Bennet and Elizabeth was really nice. I also liked Mr. Collins.MHO, this movie could have worked, it could have carved it's own place next to the Firth/Ehle version, but there are too many missteps.I wouldn't recommend paying top dollar to see this, but you could do worse on a rainy day to rent the DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pleasantly surprised,"As thousands of other fans of the A&E mini-series, I went into this movie telling myself to have an open mind. When I left the theater, with some remnants of happy tears in my eyes, I realized I felt more during this movie than the mini-series. Of course, nothing will ever compare to ""The Look"" in the mini-series, but the interaction between this version of Elizabeth and Darcy really made you feel the longing - especially on his part - he was FANTASTIC! Also, the movie showed a more realistic view of the Bennett life, I think - pigs in the back, mud, showing their level of society a bit better.Wonderful movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
gets the plot details right but misses out on some of the humor,"It seems like every time we turn around these days some filmmaker has been hard at work producing yet another adaptation of Jane Austen's most beloved novel ""Pride and Prejudice."" And even though some of the versions have been quite good actually, we can still wonder if this glut is really all that necessary. The book's two most recent incarnations came in the form of miniseries produced by the BBC, the first in 1980 and the second in 1995. However, since 1940, there has not been a ""straight"" (i.e. set in the proper time period) version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" designed specifically for the big screen. Well, now we have one, written by Deborah Moggach, directed by Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley in the lead role.This latest version is distinguished from the earlier efforts primarily by its grittier, grimier and grungier depiction of life in early 19th Century rural England. With its peeling paint and dusty furnishings, the film certainly has a less prettified and more lived-in look than we are accustomed to seeing in movies based on Austen works. Yet, perhaps because we have been spoiled by the marathon lengths of those earlier miniseries, this film, at a mere two hours and seven minutes, feels hurried and rushed as it attempts to cope with Austen's complex tale of the five Bennett sisters and their mother's frantic efforts to marry them off. We are moved so quickly through the story that some of the more subtle details of character and theme get lost along the way. Still, it's quite remarkable just how much of the plot Moggach is able to cram into a little over two hours, so that even the staunchest of Austen purists will have little to complain about on that score.What they may have reason to complain about is the fact that the film fails to capture much of the unique humor that distinguishes the novel. For the most part, the scenes are played much too seriously and ""straight,"" particularly those involving the odious Mr. Collins and the insufferably condescending Lady Catherine de Bourg, who together supply some of Austen's most bitingly witty commentary on the superficiality of England's class-conscious society. Tom Hollander gives a spiritless, leaden performance as the sycophantic minister, and Judi Dench plays Lady Catherine as if she were taking a stab at Lady MacBeth instead. The same goes for Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett, whose pivotal role as the droll, dry commentator on the absurd Mrs. Bennett's matrimonial obsessions seems to have been lost on the actor. Matthew Macfadyen fails to make an impact as the haute Mr. Darcy, although Brenda Blethyn hits the right notes as the grating mother driven to despair at the prospect of her daughters ending up old maids.In the coveted role of the high-minded, strong willed and extremely judgmental Elizabeth Bennett - certainly the most brilliant and fully realized of all Austen's creations - Knightley clearly means well but doesn't seem quite up to the task. Her annoying giggle and epicene expression make her far too silly and modern to successfully portray the rational but often misguided 19th Century heroine Austen intended Elizabeth to be.Yet, despite all these weaknesses, ""Pride and Prejudice"" makes for a reasonably entertaining film, thanks, primarily, to the strength of the original source material and the liveliness of Wright's direction (the ball scenes are exceptionally well done). The film moves quickly and does a decent job telling its story. Perhaps if we didn't have better versions to compare it to, this ""Pride and Prejudice"" would stand up better on its own. It's far from a failure, but watching this condensed version instead of the two BBC miniseries is a bit like reading the Cliff's Notes instead of the actual novel. You may be able to get the general gist of the thing, but not that wonderful flavoring that makes the original so special.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thank goodness many agree with me,"I am a great lover of Austen's works, especially Pride & Prejudice. The 1995 miniseries is so faithful to the novel its astounding. The actors are well chosen, there isn't modernized language thrown in, and each emotion is handled well. You can't help having your heart skip a beat when Elizabeth and Darcy finally realize they both love each other. You hate Caroline Bingley and Mrs Hurst. But in this latest adaption, its hard to swallow. There is no Mrs. Hurst. The Bennett family look much poorer than they are. Elizabeth walks/dresses/acts in a manner so against what women of that time would. Yes, Elizabeth Bennet is unconventional, but more in the fact that she is not afraid to express her opinions. She is, however, socially capable and proper in the way she carries herself, dresses, etc. In this, Keira walks around in cruddy clothes, and acts as though she should be down on the farm in the Midwestern USA. The scene where Elizabeth and Darcy ""can't sleep"" drove me insane. SHe would never walk out in that! The scene where Bingley just enters Jane's room as well...he would never have done that! If you haven't read the novel or seen the 1995 adaption, you'd probably love this movie. But those who love the novel or love the adaption (or both) will be very disappointed. Why there was a need to adapt this novel again, I don't know. I have nothing left to say. I know Austen would be very unhappy should she be able to see this latest movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic - a must see for all girlies!,"I am a huge fan of all the Austen books, and will never, ever tire of reading them or watching mini series/films of them.Frankly, I thought I would have to go a long way to find a better Mr Darcy than Colin Firth (1995) but if his Mr Darcy is Mr Smooth, then Matthew MacFayden's Mr Darcy is the bit of rough all girls crave sometimes.The scene where he declares his love for Elizabeth had me gasping - don't worry, I am not about to ruin it for anyone, but remember where you read it first.On the whole, I think his Darcy is a lot less insipid than Colin Firth's. Another reviewer noted that he did not act the part very well, seeming very disinterested in the whole thing. All I can say is that he acts with his eyes. The ""mirrors of the soul"" tell you that he has been struck dumb by Elizabeth, and that he is steadily falling in love with her. They show his confusion when he has been at Rosings and seen her again, the helplessness he feels when Lydia runs away with Wickham, and his pleasure at seeing Elizabeth at Pemberley. Top class indeed.Kiera Knightly is a different Elizabeth to Jennifer Ehle - but good nevertheless. She gives her the right amount of spirit, and couples it with a smile as big as the Miserable half of Derbyshire! I was worried out Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennet, as I had enjoyed the performance of Alison Steadman so much, but she was very good and gave her the right amount of ""nerves"" and had some very funny moments. Donald Sutherland, whilst excellent at the uxurious Mr Bennet, did have very, very white teeth which rather ruined the Georgian effect. Wickham, alas, left me cold. Mr Collins - ah, what can you say about the comic timing of Tom Hollander? Genius casting. Just obsequious enough to satisfy purists and very funny to boot. Rosamund Pike was excellent as Jane, but the other three sisters just made me want to slap them - perhaps it was just good acting? I have now watched the film 3 times and can't wait until the DVD comes out - rumours abound that there is an alternative ending planned for the extras. How one could have an alternative ending to such a classic is beyond me.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A love story between a wealthy man who falls for a sensible woman.,"I think this movie was excellent. I loved the way the characters came together in the end. I found it beautifully landscaped and the voices were clear you could follow along. The other movies like this I like is Jane Austen, Jane Eyre. I love dramas and moving stories.

I also, enjoyed how the writer took the story and ended it in a different way than the other directors have done it in the past. I hope that these type of stories come out more.

"Beautiful, Beautiful, and Again Beautiful; So There, Austen Purists","I watched this movie because another IMDb poster told me it was ""horrible."" I didn't expect to like it.I loved it.This ""Pride and Prejudice"" is beautiful, beautiful, and, again, beautiful. Colors are as artfully juxtaposed as in a formal painting. Shots are composed so beautifully I wanted to freeze frame at least a dozen times.The beauty here is not static. It extends to the treatment of the material. This is the third or fourth ""Pride and Prejudice"" I've seen, and this is the first one in which Darcy came across as a human life form, rather than an insect trapped in a human body. He's no less hidebound than in other versions; it's just that MacFadyen managed to convey to me that there was a man in there, somewhere.No, I didn't fall in love with Colin Firth as Darcy. Further, I find Austen's writing cold, dry, and snotty. So shoot me.The negative reviews here claim that this adaptation is not true to Austen's style. Good, I say.Negative reviews object to the Bennets living in an agricultural setting. I gotta tell ya -- it did not ruin my digestion to see a pig's hindquarters in an adaptation of an Austen work.Further, I'm one of those people who, when watching movies like this, always thinks, ""Why should I care about the fates of these upper class twits? Why are these people's servants given less attention than their picturesque stock animals?"" I was moved by Elizabeth's and Darcy's plight as depicted in this adaptation because I was so won over by the artistry of the film-making. It seduced me, in a good way, to caring about people I normally laugh at and dismiss, or wish to see overthrown in a revolution.I loved the piano soundtrack. I usually don't take note of the soundtrack until I've seen a movie a couple of times, but in exceptional cases it will make itself known to me, in a good way. it did here. The music enhanced the experience for me. I felt tender, sweet, open to the experience.I'm not an Austen fan. I'm not an Anglophile. I'm a movie fan. I love good movies. And this was a good movie. I think that the Austen purists who gave this movie one-star reviews are riding their high horses so hard that they missed what could have otherwise been a beautiful experience.

Rent the 1995 mini series,"By now, I'd be surprised if anyone did not know the general plot outlines of Pride and Prejudice, so I won't try to summarize the story. This will be quick and to the point. On the plus side, this movie has some stunning cinematography, wonderful music and the incomparable Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennet. For the rest, it felt like a Cliff Notes version of the story, too much attempted in too short a time. On top of that, it seemed as though the director actually never read the book. The director and screenwriter have somehow missed that the title of the book is Pride and Prejudice, not Elizabeth and Darcy. Every character has been homogenized for mass consumption in the service of the central love story. Judy Dench does the most she can with a character whose stinger has been plucked, Tom Hollander actually makes Mr. Collins a sympathetic character and even Tallulah Riley (as pedantic sister Mary) has a screen moment where the audience feels sympathy for her. In short, they have stripped the story of all its bite, wit and context, leaving poor Keira Knightly and Matthew McFadyen nothing to do but look beautiful. (which they both manage very well, indeed) Beyond that are the glaring attempts to update the movie, adding to or changing scenes from the book.If you want a pretty movie with a neat happy ending, this is it. If, on the other hand, you want a rich cinematic experience of a literary classic, skip this and rent the 1995 mini series.",,Anonymous,Romance
A humorless Pride and Prejudice,"The movie is reasonably enjoyable and often attractive to look at. The leading lady, Keira Knightley, is charming, lovely and frequently bewitching as Elizabeth Bennett, but this Miss Bennett is not quite Jane Austen's Miss Bennett, nor is this Pride and Prejudice quite Miss Austen's Pride and Prejudice. For one thing, the humor has been leached out and the whole story taken very seriously indeed. This has the effect of making Austen's affectionately caricatured folks (such as Mrs. Bennett or Mr. Collins or even Lady Catherine) into somewhat monstrous characters. Instead of seeming silly, they seem almost malevolent. The whole picture is very realistically depicted: the assembly ball feels claustrophobic, hot and stuffy; the Bennetts live on a working farm, with plenty of messy livestock. The whole emotional tone of the picture is serious indeed. Elizabeth's final interview with Lady Catherine is brutal, played with heightened emotion, far from the mannerly but cleverly hostile scene written by Austen.Judi Dench is in her dowager duchess mode as Lady Catherine, effective but too little used; a treat nevertheless. Matthew McFayden's rather hangdog Darcy passes muster, but I think most fans will prefer Colin Firth in the A&E miniseries. Simon Woods as Bingley and Rosamund Pike as Jane are just perfect, the best ever. Brenda Blethyn is fine indeed as this particular kind of Mrs. Bennett, but I can't say as much for Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennett; he seems miscast much of the time, and what in blazes is he doing at the assumbly ball? (He grins entirely too much, too).I prefer the old BBC miniseries (with its limited production values) even to the very lavish, handsome and enjoyable A&E miniseries. The BBC version was scripted by Fay Weldon, who maintained the perfect Austen tone throughout. While A&E did not manage to do that all the time, the new movie doesn't even seem to try. The final tacked-on scene will be a real jolt for Austen purists: a romantic scene for the married Darcys in the garden at Pemberly, very atmospheric and purple dialog abounding. Why not just tuck us in bed for the wedding night?But you know, maybe this will lead a few more people to the immortal book itself, so I wish the movie a huge success. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Bennets,"Jane Austen is one of the best English writers of all times. Her novels have endured the passage of time. ""Pride and Prejudice"" is perhaps a masterpiece that is captured exquisitely by Joe Wright, who with the adapter, Deborah Moggach, has created a beautiful film that will live forever.Much has been said in this forum about the movie and how some people feel this new version of the Austen's novel compares to other screen treatment, most notably the 1995 mini series. Comparisons are unfair to this new installment because it should stand on its own merits. In fact, credit has to be given to Mr. Wright for the exquisite treatment he and his cinematographer, Roman Osin, has given the finished product. The atmospheric musical score by Dario Marianelli enhances the film, and the editing of Paul Toehill is great.The only recommendation to anyone is to go to this film without any preconceived ideas. Just take in the glorious colors exploding in the big screen and fall in love with the Bennets, and all the Austen characters that come alive under the direction of Mr. Wright.Keira Knightly is the best excuse for going to see ""Pride and Prejudice"". She is a young actress doing an amazing job with her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet. Matthew MacFayden cuts quite a figure as the dashing Mr. Darcy. The two stars have the right chemistry to make this film a winner because of the love we know they feel for one another from the start.Brenda Blethyn, as the calculating, and silly, Mrs. Bennet has some good moments. Donald Sutherland underplays his Mr. Bennet to give us a man that is out place among all the Bennet women with their conflicts. Judi Dench is seen as Lady Catherine de Bourg, the bitchy noble woman who thinks her nephew, Mr. Darcy is too good for Elizabeth. Her scene toward the end of the film when she confronts the young woman is one of the highlights of the movie, as we don't expect Lizzie's reaction toward this harpy.Go see ""Pride and Prejudice"" and just enjoy and absorb the wonderful trip back in time that Joe Wright has invited us to take with him.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pride and Prejudice - Excellent use of cinematography to capture the characters,"Pride and Prejudice captures the essence of Jane Austen's book, paying great attention to both characters and detail to create an emotional screen adaption. This is one film that uses cinematography to an advantage in capturing lush landscapes, enhancing the feelings of the characters with appropriate camera angles and shots, and representing period history through costume and rich rural landscape. I expect that everyone who sees this film will be 'blown away' by the cinematography, which is used in a major way to tell the story of Elizabeth and her family and Mr. Darcy.This screen adaption succeeds in attracting an audience through familiar faces and a timeless classic, which should not be regarded solely as a great love story but should be regarded as a timeless classic portraying social history and a class system. (This film has the potential to be enjoyed by many different types of individual.) In conclusion, Pride and Prejudice succeeds in this screen adaption through excellent cinematography that enhances the characters and emotions while representing a class structure. Good job. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Old story in a modern film,"Nowadays the world is full with books and movies about the greater love which destroys all the stereotypes and strict society rules. However, there are immortal world known love stories and truly my favourite one has recently been released as a wonderful movie ""Pride and Prejudice"". This movie is based on an old classic book of Jane Ostin about unbelievable love in a nineteenth century.The plot is build around the relationship between a man, Mr. D'Arcy, and a woman, Elizabeth Bennet, who by the strict rules of English society cannot be together. During their first meeting, she thought he is too arrogant, while the behaviour of her relatives completely ruined his good attitude towards her. However, over time Elizabeth changes her opinion and realizes that behind this mask of arrogance, there is actually a kind and noble man. Their love survived through misunderstandings, social stereotypes and arrogance.The film is a worthy adaptation of the book. Especially I want to mention the excellent play of the cast. The director managed to accurately capture not only the atmosphere of that century, but also the subtle flutter of the main characters' souls, which keeps viewers interested for the whole time. The film correctly reveals all the main twists of the plot.All in all, this movie is definitely worth watching as it is a classic love story, that will never die.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Period? Period!,"In general, this is an enjoyable movie and true to the book (which far outshines any movie made of it - which is why it's still read and enjoyed, and will be for the foreseeable future). Keira Knightley is smart and a delight to watch. But some things kept slapping me in the face, detracting from my experience greatly.If a director goes about placing a movie in a specified period - as with Austen's works - he or she should take care to be true to the period in all matters, and this is the difficulty I have with the new P&P.Ladies do not run! It's fine to show Lydia and the little sisters running indoors to show their ""wildness"", but Lizzie herself does not run - I believe it was at one of the balls. This was not done!Ladies appear in public with their hair properly dressed! Lizzie would no more appear at Netherfield with her hair hanging loose than she would appear in her nightclothes!Speaking of nightclothes, ladies do not leave their bedrooms in their nightclothes (except for middle-of-the-night emergencies, as when Marianne is ill in S&S); they do not come down to breakfast in nightgowns, as Lizzie did once (don't remember exact scene). (If this dress was not supposed to be a nightgown, well, then my gripe is with the costume designer.)Ladies certainly do not sit tailor-fashion, as Lizzie is shown doing in the ""Mrs. Darcy"" scene at the end. In this era, ladies rode sidesaddle if they rode at all - legs were kept rigorously together!The director completely missed the restrictions women had on the use of their bodies, certainly up through the Victorian era. Mrs. Bennett neglected many important parts of her daughters' education, but she would have trained her girls to comport themselves properly and behave appropriately. This was a mark of class, and the Bennett girls are a gentleman's daughters (as Lizzie reminds Lady Catherine). Even Ang Lee got this right in Sense and Sensibility (but he also had the superb Emma Thompson to assist him in this).No, I'm not a member of any Jane Austen society (tho I've considered it), just an ex-English teacher. I like to see the details right, and Joe Wright messed this one up.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Long dress flutters, the breeze is blowing","Excellence is ability, it is courage to dare to be excellent, it is luck to meet people who can appreciate you, and it is the same for women in ancient and modern China. What moved me most about Elizabeth was that she had never wronged her excellence. She transcends her time with her excellence. Jan Austin is good for the same reason. But it is not necessary to hold a hate for Zhang Ailing because it is also a kind of luck to meet others, although it cannot be compared with Sister Lin. Ai Ling must know that the common people have their own Qing Jiayun Road, and they must not imitate a fairyland.

Isn't It Romantic?  Better than Comfort Food,"Saw it twice. The first time I went I realized that I had started an internal dialog comparing it to the 1995 5 hour plus mini-series, and this comparison continued throughout the entire picture. So I went a second time, put Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle out of my mind, and sat back and thoroughly enjoyed it. Just over two hours, the film is fun with all the comedy, silliness, and ups and downs of the Bennett family.It's a great romp through Jane Austen's England, and I was surprised to read that this was the directorial debut of Joe Wright. Everyone sparkled in the film, although Mr. Collins seemed a step behind. Keira talks too fast or is it that she cuts off her words in certain scenes, and the background music sometimes overwhelms the spoken lines of the actors. Hats off to the new Darcy. He was excellent, seductive voice and looks better and better as the camera closes in on him. The chemistry was palpable. The cinematography and locations were very, very good.

Why another Pride and Prejudice?,"OK where do I begin? First the writing: the idiot who wrote this screenplay thought himself superior in writing to Jane Austen and decided to replace Austen's superb economy of words with his own ramblings. Second of all the whole story completely lacks the understanding of social interactions and mores that governed the early 19th century British society. At the time, a woman of 19 or 20 was expected to fully run a household and a gentlewoman was expected to handle many servants as well. Kira Knightly plays Elizabeth as a giggling airhead more at home at the main shopping drags of Paris, London and Los Angeles now than in 19th century British countryside. To add to the travesty we have Donald Sutherland playing Mr. Bennet not as a British eccentric but like an ex-hippie. It is as if Sutherland is channeling his character from Kelly's Heroes.As for other characters, Darcy is forgettable. One wonders why anyone would love him Judy Densch has too much bearing to play the foolish Lady Catherine. Finally, Mrs. Bennet is not the oaf that Jane Austen makes her to be.Having said all this, the main problem with this movie is that it is a ""Romantic"" movie in the true sense of the word, i.e., its heart and its values are those associated with the romantic movement of mid 19th century. However, Pride and Prejudice the book is decidedly ""unromantic"" and ""rationalistic."" While romanticism is based on rebellion against convention, Pride and Prejudice is rather a celebration of social convention. The people who would be romantic heroes in other novels, i.e., Wickham and Lydia are treated as fools and knaves. On the other hand Elizabeth and Jane, fall in love within the conventions of the day and are given full rewards and happy endings. This movie is contrary to that spirit.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Best Pride and Prejudice Ever,"Having seen every version of the Jane Austen classic, I say this is by far the best. Much of the credit goes to Keira Knightley, who, in addition to being the prettiest young woman in the movies today, is also a marvelous actress. (She may be prettier than Elizabeth is intended to be, but who can complain about that?) Keira is on screen almost constantly, and she runs through the full range of emotions in her dealings with her silly mother (Brenda Blythen), her gruff but loving father (Donald Sutherland), her sisters, the self-satisfied fool of a clergyman who seeks her hand in marriage (Tom Hollander), the terrible Lady de Bourg (Judi Dench) and, of course, with the prideful Darcy whom she eventually comes to love (Matthew MacFayden). Every one of these roles in perfectly cast and brilliantly performed. MacFayden is a new face to me but he is certainly a future star, and he is the complete Darcy: prideful, incapable of small talk, a loyal and generous friend, ultimately desperate to be loved by Elizabeth. The director, Joe Wright, gives it the Merchant-Ivory touch, gorgeous color, magnificent buildings, utterly faithful to the tone of the book. Doubtless this film is too small and uncommercial to win all the prizes it deserves but here's hoping that Keira Knightley is honored for the best starring performance of 2005. Her talent equals her looks, and that's saying quite a lot. Pride and Prejudice is a great book, and it is fully realized here for the very first time.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Overzealously innocuous.,"After reading what was quite simply the most median novel in existence, I was looking forward to a movie adaptation that would better paint the picture of the odd relationship between the erratic Bennet family and the poor souls they encounter throughout the novel. I was extremely whelmed. While the novel took too long to finish, the movie was over very fast. It brushed through key events from the book, and told the story very plainly, albeit they were hard to understand at times. The cast, similar to Lucky Charms, is full of bland and unassuming pulverized oats, but has a handful of marshmallows here and there, featuring two Hunger Games stars, along with the chick who killed Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean, and who could forget Mr. Paradox from Deadpool & Wolverine?

Adorable film version and both stars shine,"I've seen this film three times already and adore it. It's an adorable version that stands up to other more well known versions. Keira Knightley was wonderful as Lizzy and brought sympathy, feistiness, spunk, loyalty and confusion to the role while Matthew MacFadyen was equally wonderful in his role as our new Darcy. He had a lot to live up to, but, didn't disappoint and, by playing it his own way instead portraying him like other versions, he brought something new to the role as well and I hope to see a lot more of him in future roles.Matthew and Keira had such lovely chemistry as Darcy and Lizzt and you could almost believe them falling inlove and both stars shone in the roles that must be their best yet. All the supporting characters were equally well performed by excellent actors, the storyline remained the same, but, different and touchingly lovely and my only complaint is that for the first time I could easily have watched far more of this film and these characters I can't wait for the DVD to watch as many times as I like",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Even the costumes seemed out of place on her anorexic frame, could they not at least have given her a wonder-bra, or even some socks?Darcy came across more as a sulky teenager than an English Gentleman and MacFadyen does not possess the same air of dignity and grace that is Colin Firth. In the true story, Elizabeth's love for Darcy developed so gradually, yet here it progressed too quickly and therefore spoilt the whole general feeling and suspense of the story. The film altogether was rushed through at an alarming pace without the viewer ever really getting to know a character, and the whole 'Lydia saga' seemed to be resolved and forgotten in a matter of hours.The language jumped and interchanged from the original script to modern English, even during the same conversations, resulting in a very confusing mess. This was especially apparent in the first proposal from Darcy, which was so cringe-worthy I could barely stop myself from covering my ears and running out of the cinema.This film was cast, produced and directed so poorly, I beg everyone to read the book or watch the original in order to enjoy this fabulous story and leave this pure Americanised trash where it belongs.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A wonderful production... full of colour, character, humour and emotion.","A wonderful production, full of colour, character, humour and emotion. Clearly an abridged version, mainly focused on the relationship between Lizzie and Darcy, so don't expect everything from the book ... just enjoy what what you do see! The acting is superb from all of the actors involved, the almost hysterical laughter at times between the sisters manages to capture the sheer excitement of first love, while the dedication to the point of nervous exhaustion of Mrs Bennett in securing a suitable marriage for her daughters shows love of another kind. Mr Bennett too almost surprises you with the depth of his feelings. Actors cannot please everyone, but I left feeling involved, moved and happy, I only wish it was longer!

"Not Perfect, but Thoroughly Enjoyable!","This movie was very good! I thoroughly enjoyed it. I do not understand the harsh comments on this film. If you've read the novel, you may be slightly disappointed by the movie. There are many people who are trying to compare the movie to the 1995 miniseries. Well, that is all well and good, but one must remember to keep in mind that you cannot get all of the story into 2 hours worth of time unless you divide it up into a miniseries. Sure, important story lines were shortened or left out entirely. However, I think that the scriptwriters did an excellent job of condensing the story into the highlights. I do not know how people can complain so much about the script because most of it is taken directly from the text of the novel.The acting in this movie was pretty good. I could not have picked a better Elizabeth Bennet than Keira Knightley. She captured the essence of the character beautifully. Matthew Macfadyen was a good Mr. Darcy. However, I think that he should have based his portrayal more on the novel rather than what was scripted. He seemed more like a shy schoolboy rather than an arrogant and prejudiced aristocrat. The secondary characters were casted well. Brenda Blethyn was a wonderful Mrs. Bennet (she could have been even more obnoxious if you ask me!). Tom Hollander was a perfect Mr. Collins. He made you want to squirm which is exactly the effect that was needed for the character. And as always, Judi Dench was superb as Lady Catherine.The cinematography for this film was excellent. The settings and costumes for this movie were so lush that you longed to be there with them. I also felt that the music was good for the movie. It fit well with the story and helped you feel the emotions that were meant to be felt during specific parts of the movie.Overall, I liked this film a lot. I do not think that it would be a disappointment to Jane Austen like others have said. It doesn't capture all that it should from the novel, but movies rarely do. If you can accept that the movie will not be able to fully do justice to every part of the book, then I suggest you give this movie a try!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Who knew?  Keira Knightley can actually act!,"I stumbled onto this adaptation of the famous novel on TV, only a few weeks after having viewed the Greer Garson / Lawrence Olivier version. I admit I honestly was not prepared to enjoy it much. After seeing Keira Knightley's - ahem - ""acting"" in the various ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" films, I expected something along the lines of Demi Moore's ""Scarlett Letter"". To my great surprise, she was quite good!This movie definitely has a more modern feel than the 1940 version, which is to be expected. But with much of the formality stripped away, the emotions are better revealed. Knightley gives a very fine performance as the proud girl whose head will not be so easily turned, and refuses to let her family be trifled with; her anger and resentment when she learns of Darcy's interference with Jane's romance (and in rudely rebuffing his proposal) is much more genuine than that of Garson's Lizzie. Matthew Macfadyen also does well, playing Darcy not as Olivier's arrogant fop, but as a young man who wishes to do the right thing, but sometimes seems constrained almost to the point of stuttering by his shyness.Smaller roles were also well cast: the somewhat surprising choice of Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet was a pleasure in his every scene, and Brenda Blethyn as his well-intentioned but frivolous wife was almost as much fun as 1940's Mary Boland. Rosamund Pike practically emanated goodness as the gentle Jane, while Judy Dench commanded her every scene as the blood-chilling Lady Catherine, who would not easily allow her stratum of society to be polluted by the upstart Bennet family. (That was the kind of role trademarked by Edna May Oliver, though, and I still prefer her, even if she did allow some sliver of goodness to peek through.)I have not seen the oft-cited BBC adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"", but I can attest that this 2005 version was also an excellent production. It is quite accessible to modern audiences, and has been made so without the common error of ""dumbing down"" the story or characters for modern tastes. It's nice to see that enjoyable period movies from classic literature can still be made without tossing in a rock ballad or changing the setting to modern Los Angeles, just to please the kiddies.Rent this one and get your teenage daughter to watch it (it'll be easier if you mention Keira Knightley stars.) Who knows, you just may open a whole new world to her.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Outstanding,"Terrific acting all around. A fantastic production.The novel is considered by many to be the greatest romance ever written. The movie does it justice. The script and direction are excellent. The lead actors are first rate. Keira Knightly does a superb job; Matthew Macfayden should have been launched into major stardom. Donald Sutherland in a limited role gives a performance as good as any I've seen. Simon Woods does the role of Mr. Bingley so well, I will likely always associate him with that character. The cast of major characters is fairly large and all the supporting performances are very good.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Four weddings and the funeral of common sense,"P&P is often compared to a Swiss watch and very few novels are this intricately woven together. There are numerous love stories, successful and unsuccessful fortune hunters of both sexes, embarrassing and wilful parents each impinging one on another, each bringing the two principle lovers, Elizabeth and Darcy closer together or driving them further apart. At the beginning characters are grouped according to their fortunes and status. By the end of the novel, they have rearranged themselves according to sense, ability and intelligence.If you take the screws out of a mechanism this complex, you will never get it back together again. Andrew Davies, in the 1995 version, had six hours of screen time and left them where they were. He was neither required to cut essential characters, or miss out essential plot items. The downside of putting so much of Austen's dialogue on screen is that his own attempts, such as the scenes at the inn at Lambton and Pemberley stick out unattractively from Austen's crisp satirical work and sometimes, especially when he trying for irony, his script work can look positively crude.Attempting to be true to the principle character, however, in two hours has here entailed throwing away vital bits of the Swiss watch. Wickham is there, briefly, and so is Lydia. The Gardiners are almost out, the Hursts are gone completely. There isn't time for Darcy's letter, the express from London and Mrs Gardiner's letter explaining Darcy's discovery of Lydia isn't necessary because it's not clear what Darcy has done to help.And why would he need to do anything? What could scandal mean to a family living as the Bennets do in this version? I appreciate the need for a different look to the 1995 version but putting the Bennett's into a house that looks like a pigsty from a much earlier age is the real problem with this version for me.The comedy of class and manners is destroyed by degrading the life of the Bennets to the sort of sub-gentility that might have been appropriate to an adaptation of Tom Jones or even Moll Flanders but is ridiculous for the family of a wealthy country attorney. In the novel, Elizabeth Bennet, daughter of a middle class gentleman marries someone from the upper middle class with dubiously aristocratic connections. In this version, the daughter of a family about to fall into extreme poverty marries a belted Earl (Pemberley is Chatsworth here - one of the largest stately homes in England - definitely NOT where the Darcy's would be living). The Bennett's home would have been large, clean, genteel, separated from the farm and well run. The Gardiners, would have had half a floor to themselves in the Inn at Lambton and would never have dreamt of dining with the drunken regulars. The pantomime with the letter in the inn is inexcusable. The characters pop in and out of shot like Bill and Ben.Since the the comedy of class and manners is tossed away, you're left with the performances. These are patchy and condemn the whole to disintegration.Elizabeth is justabout OK but the other characters don't take off. Brenda Blethyn, excellent as usual but criminally underused and playing someone other than Mrs Bennet. Matthew McFadyen got the message and didn't try to be Colin Firth but forget to be Darcy. Donald Sutherland, accent all over the place and where was the sardonic cynicism? Judi Dench didn't have enough time. Jena Malone as Lydia couldn't be outrageous enough for who would look unusual or out of place in that household?On the whole, a version that might not go down as the worst ever, even if it can't possibly be used by students.Belongs on the shelf next to the Patricia Rozema Mansfield Park. Complete and utter failure as an adaptation but watchable on a Sunday afternoon if you can put the original aside.",,Anonymous,Romance
It really slow burned,"I really enjoyed Pride & Prejudice for its mesmerizing visuals and rich 18th-century atmosphere. From the stunning landscapes to the beautiful, almost painterly lighting, the film completely immerses you in its world. The attention to detail in the costumes and set design perfectly captures the elegance and charm of the era, making every frame a feast for the eyes. The camera work is equally impressive, with thoughtfully composed angles that add to the overall beauty of the film.However, while the visuals are captivating, the dialogue and acting occasionally gave me the ick. Maybe it's just me not being in the mood for some of the cornier exchanges. Still, it's not enough to detract from the overall experience-it's good, even if some moments felt slightly off to me.The pacing is where I found myself feeling a bit conflicted. After about an hour and a half, I realized that not much had happened in terms of plot development. While I love a slow-burn narrative, the action and tension didn't pick up until the last 30 minutes, which made the final act feel a bit rushed. I'm not sure if the original book is paced this way, but it felt like the movie spent a long time building atmosphere without much payoff until the very end.Despite this, Pride & Prejudice is still a very comfortable, pleasant movie to watch. It's visually beautiful, with a cozy atmosphere that draws you in, even if the story takes a while to get going. If you're in the mood for a film that focuses on aesthetics and mood, rather than fast-paced plot twists, this one is definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pride and Prejudice is perfection to say the least,"I cannot believe I almost passed on Pride and Prejudice. I wanted to see it all along, but I chose other movies instead. This week, the only thing that was new and nearly enticing was the Kid and I. I chose the better of the two.Pride and Prejudice was without a doubt the best romantic period piece I have ever seen. I tried Vanity Fair and Girl With a Pearl Earring and others in the past but none were as delightful. The others were so stiff and stodgy by comparison. They usually are aren't they? P&P was so beautiful and lively.Every performer was perfect. Nearly every camera shot was a work of art. Even one of those ""line dances"" was so artful and absorbing, I nearly didn't notice in one scene that the ballroom was subliminally emptied to imply Elizabeth and Mr Darcy were so drawn to each other that they didn't feel anyone else's presence. When I finally caught on, I thought, ""DAMN good camera work and direction!! DAMN good acting!!"".Donald Sutherland was given a chance to show his best stuff ever! He is a great actor but now he has proved he is a GREAT actor! Judi Dench was great as well. Of all the characters, hers was the most distinguishable due to the wickedness and cold-heartedness of her character. She was someone you could easily despise and pity at the same time. Keira Knightley and Rosamund Pike...WOW!!!! I had no idea Keira was such a fantastic actress. Sure we all know she is a beautiful woman, but what a wonderful performance she gave. Rosamund was equally as attractive and will be on my list of talented beauties to watch.All of the performers were so talented and easy to watch, I had no time to let my mind wander as it often does. But it is not all due to the acting of course. Joe Wright was THE right director for the job and Deborah Moggach succeeded with a succulent screenplay. Thanks to everyone involved for making this move as beautiful as it is.I have a widely varied taste when it comes to music and movies so I can attend most any style and remain objective and I encourage those with equally varied tastes to see this splendid, heart warming movie without hesitation. True, if you do not want to see this type of romance, you may be best off not seeing it. But you never know what may change your mind and your taste. This one may just be the one to make that change. I give it a 10/10 and I do not feel that is sufficient.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyed it immensely,"I just saw it yesterday. I've read the book numerous times and watched the BBC series endlessly (in fact, it just happened to be on TV on Friday!). I still loved the movie. I think comparing a 5-hour mini-series and a 2-hour movie is an exercise in futility. The bottom line: the movie broadened but kept the humor of the book. It exaggerated the differences in class/income between Darcy and the Bennets (Longbourne is shown as a working farm/Lizzie and Jane share a bed -- which JA did with her sister...). It switched around some dialog and condensed and telescoped the story to basically Lizzie/Darcy, but I thought it was effective, albeit impressionistic. The movie also had a refreshing vigor. I was pleasantly surprised by Keira Knightly though she is a bit too glamorous at times (I could see her eye makeup). Matt MacFadyen makes a wonderful -- and different -- Darcy than our Colin. I love eye acting and he does that in spades. He makes him more vulnerable, a young man of high rank who's not that quite confident in himself. A friend who has not read the book but owns the mini-series quipped after we saw the movie, ""Colin who?"" There are Bronte-esquire touches. (But there were some Bronte-esquire touches to the mini-series -- like the bath scene, the lake scene and some of Colin's brooding alone moments.) And yeah, the US ending scene PP3 is Harlequin saccharine. Another member of our movie watching group, who is not a Jane Austen fan and actually disliked the book when she read for her book club, said the movie changed her mind. She had become impatient with the seeming frivolity of the characters' lives and the movie made her appreciate better how women of the time were desperately dependent on good marriages. If nothing else, it may have made a Jane Austen fan! Favorite minor character: Mr. Collins, who kept the audience howling. And Donald Sutherland's last scene is divine.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Embarrassingly bad,"I think the Cliffs Notes for 'P&P' might have more of the nuance of the novel than this rubbish - and I'm not entirely convinced anyone in the production team even looked at those. This version is just bizarre - no sense of time period, how people really lived, how people behaved - why make a period film if you're not interested in the period? Good grief, there were costumes from 50 years prior to the time, and then one from the 1990s. And pigtails like Dorothy's. But that's besides the point - to paraphrase from the book, it's the total want of thematic honesty so uniformly betrayed by everyone involved in this production that absolutely sinks it. Unromantic, unfunny and completely uninteresting - if you want the pleasure of this story, curl up and read the book again.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Enchanting movie,"*Pride and Prejudice* is my favorite Jane Austen novel and the British mini-series version is my favorite video version of the novel. I am so pleased to say that this new production of P&P is absolutely enchanting. Needless to say, much of the story had to be cut from the book--the mini-series, therefore, will always be my favorite video version--but the movie, while flawed, is still excellent.Keira Knightley is effervescent and charming. Hers is a younger Lizzie than Jennifer Ihle's, but what a delightful character! Indeed, I think I sometimes heard a phrasing of lines that came straight from Ihle's performance.MacFayden's Mr. Darcy is very different than Colin Firth's portrayal. His Darcy is a passionate, shy man, perhaps not as truly prideful as the Darcy of the novel, but the performance works. Most importantly, there is a true screen chemistry between Knightley and MacFayden.I will definitely be going back to see this movie and will purchase the DVD when it is produced.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Leave Your Expectations at the Door and Just Have Fun,"Let's get this out of the way: this is not the A&E 5-hour version of Jane Austen's novel. This movie does not star Colin Firth. This version takes greater liberty with the Austen book than does the A&E version.Good, I'm glad that's behind us. Now just sit back and enjoy what happens to be a stellar film. Of course this version is a less literal adaptation, but it doesn't have the luxury of being 5 hours long. And there is much about this version that I thought was actually better than the A&E version. For example, this version is much more cinematic and never more so than at the astoundingly filmed ball scenes, when the camera takes off swooping and swirling around the actors in some of the most complexly choreographed shots I've ever seen. Keira Knightly and Matthew Mcfadyen seem more right for the roles than did Jennifer Ehle and Firth; they're at least closer to the age of the characters as depicted in Austen's book. Brenda Blethyn improves on the character of Mrs. Bennett, turning her into a real human character rather than a broad caricature. And Judi Dench has a ball storming on to the screen in a couple of scenes and decimating everyone in her path.This film is for people who already know the book and Austen's characters. It's a very fresh and exciting telling of a very familiar story---who really needs yet one more ploddingly faithful movie that dares not deviate at all from the novel? We already have a faithful adaptation that's not going away just because this movie came out, and the book is always there to reread if you need your fix of unadulterated Austen. All I can say is, I was in an audience full of obvious ""Pride & Prejudice"" junkies, and they were on the edges of their seats through the entire length of this film. Highly recommended.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
This story follows the Bennet family who have 5 daughters of marrying age. The 2nd oldest Elizabeth meets Mr Darcy who is in love with her however Lizzy loathes him.,"The script was rushed, very unbelievable and i was bored out of my brain Rosamund Pike was the surprising strong point in this movie portraying Jane as the reserved person i visioned she was in Jane Austen's novel. Matthew McFayden, although not the greatest Mr Darcy, provided sufficient eye-candy and Keira Knightley played an acceptable Lizzy although her emotions expressed as the character, were crap! Historically it provided great scenery and great sets, however etiquette of Ms Knightley left ""nothing to be desired"" and also her younger sister (Mary). Lydia and Kitty were hard to tell apart, until Lydia continued her path away. Overall, not the greatest adaptation.",,Anonymous,Romance
She speaks her mind,"Although I have a great fondness for the MGM version of Pride And Prejudice that came out in 1940 probably this English version of the pinnacle of Jane Austen's literary talents is probably closer to what she had in mind. Women have certainly come a long way since those Victorian times Ms. Austen chronicled so well.Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethlyn play the Bennetts the proud parents of five lovely daughters that is a source of great concern. In those days with no careers open to women the idea is marry well. The parents are concerned that suitable matches are made for them. One daughter Jane looks to marry a handsome and pleasant but rather dull young man named Bingley. Looking good till Bingley's friend Darcy warns him off the husband hunting Bennett clan.This sets up the main plot of the story the growing love of Jane's sister Elizabeth played by Keira Knightley and Darcy played by Matthew MacFayden. Both read each other wrong at first. Darcy like all the others is first shocked by Elizabeth who does not conform to Victorian standards for young women, she speaks her mind. And Elizabeth misreads Darcy's character totally at first. It turns out that character is something he has a lot of.This version of Pride And Prejudice got four Oscar nominations including Keira Knightley for Best Actress. One of the other nominations was for Art&Set Design. The 1940 MGM version won the Oscar for Art&Set Design for what they created on MGM's back lot. Here the cinematography and the sets made ample use of the English countryside. See these versions back to back and see which one you think did better in the Art&Set Department.As for the story Jane Austen and her times continue to fascinate.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Pride in bad acting, Prejudice against great acting.","In this adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, it seems as though the characters are taking their lines straight from the text without any context. I feel as though some actors had not even read the book before starring in important roles such as Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy.I do believe that there are some great moments in this movie in terms of acting and staging, but as soon as Darcy comes up on screen it all falls apart. In the book, Mr. Darcy appears to be a cold man with no character, but this is taken too far in the film. When Elizabeth is proposed to in the rain, it feels as though an extra was hastily cast and is reading from a teleprompter or cue cards placed offset.Mr. Bingley is turned from this charming man that every woman is after to a nitwit that does not know his arm from his leg. In an attempt to breathe new life into this character, they managed to simply turn him into a character that I frankly thought I would be able to play better. He is turned to a fool rather than who the man in the novel was.I believe that the best performance in this movie came from Tom Hollander as Mr. Collins. He managed to bring this character to life, and was portrayed exactly as he seemed in the novel. Somehow, this one character that has less screen time than some minor characters has a better actor than both of the lead males in the film. It's honestly shameful!I believe that the only reason for watching this film is educational purposes in acting academies as a punishment for failing to live up to the role you were cast as. At the very least some of the minor and background characters tried to show some understanding of Jane Austen's original novel. She would be ashamed if she would have lived another 200 years to see this!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Brilliant!!!,"This version of Pride and Prejudice is even better than the originals!!! I have read the book as well and it is a brilliant portrayal. Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFayden shine as Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy. Elizabeth Bennet is an intelligent, spirited young woman who will not let her rank control her life. She will marry for love and nothing else. While Mr. Darcy may ""seem"" proud, he is a charming character that the audience will fall in love with. There is just enough humor, romance, and intelligence combined to create the perfect movie. I also love that they cut out the more dull parts of the book and just move right along.

who hired the scriptwriters?,"I have given this film a score of 2, one point due to the lovely scenery, the other for the actors who worked well enough with the script they were offered.Overall this film was a debacle. Perhaps it should have been called 'A film loosely based on a book by some woman of no great note' for all the credit the scriptwriters gave Jane Austen. Fans of Austen, save your money and watch the BBC version again (Firth etc). I believe it truly an insult to one of the greatest authors of history to dismember her story, words, settings and even delete all wit from one of the most perfect love stories, and observances of manner and class, of all time,Even the costuming is a disaster, the wigs awful, and where were half the characters? One begins to suspect they had a very small budget after paying Keira's fee, or perhaps it was all spent on hiring the rocks who really stole the show (even though Elizabeth and her relatives are supposed to be headed for the lakes district). I am so appalled by the 'movie machine' these days, and scriptwriters please get over yourselves. you will never ever compare to the true literary greats.To all those who have never heard of Jane Austen, you may well enjoy this film and go see it by all means.I am so, so sorely disappointed.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lovely Film,"I loved this new adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.

I'm laughing now as I imagine all my friends gasping collectively, as they know I'm a huge Firth fan. But I really do like Matthew's portrayal better of Mr. Darcy.

"The beauty of the 2005 version is in the simplest, most powerful form","Deeply moving; very touching. I've seen every version of Pride and Prejudice previous to seeing the 2005 version. Every version has its beauty. The beauty of this version is that it touches the depth of love with sometimes the simplest of words, but allows the viewer to feel the gravity of their meaning by how they are portrayed by the characters. This film is very effective in involving the viewer in an emotional finale by gratifying the viewer's wishes, the way ""Sense and Sensibility"" did. Honestly, I'm very critical of film, and although there were moments when I thought ""oh is this cheesy,"" by the time phrases were repeated often enough in different tones instead of my not identifying with the film, I was crying along with the film.

understanding how a book becomes a feature film,"A movie for the age, and a keeper for the ages,""Pride and Prejudice"" brings Jane Austen's best-loved novel to vivid, widescreen life, as well as making an undisputed star of 20-year-old Keira Knightley. Making positive use of actors closer to the characters' real ages, but also benefiting from a visual approach by young British director Joe Wright that melds realism with romance in a canny balance, film looks set to appeal to more than just Jane Austen purists.Aficionados of the 1995 five-hour BBC miniseries, with Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth Bennet and Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, won't necessarily be convinced by this big screen version. But anyone coming to the movie fresh and not demanding a chapter-by-chapter adaptation will respond to the picture's emotional sweep, sumptuous lensing and marvelous sense of ensemble.Wright, 33, who comes from a realist tradition in British miniseries (""Charles II: The Power & the Passion""), and screenwriter Deborah Moggach, a novelist and miniseries adaptor in her own right, extract the youthful essence of Austen's novel, as well as providing a richly detailed setting. Scenes barely sketched in Austen's dialog heavy, description-light prose leap fully detailed onto the screen, thanks to Sarah Greenwood's terrific production design and Jacqueline Durran's textured costumes.Taking their cue from when the novel was first written rather than published, both designers go for a softer, late 18th-century look rather than a stiffer early 19th-century one. More relaxed vibe fits better with an adaptation that gives a slightly modern twist to the characters. As an evocation of period English life in the shires, ""P&P,"" though set around a century earlier, is the most flavorsome since Phil Agland's under-rated version of Thomas Hardy's ""The Woodlanders.""Moggach's solution to paring down the novel is to concentrate on Elizabeth (Knightley), the second of five daughters belonging to a couple (Donald Sutherland, Brenda Blethyn) of reasonable but by no way lavish means. When news comes that a wealthy young bachelor, Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods), has moved into a nearby stately manor, Elizabeth's mother smells a convenient match in the making.Film's knockout first reel, composed of two long sequences, scoops the viewer up into late 18th-century market-town life and the main characters' lives. Opening sequence, with the first of many long steadicam takes, follows Elizabeth as she walks up to and inside the family home. Pic then cuts straight to a local ball, where Elizabeth's elder sister, Jane (Rosamund Pike), comes under Bingley's eye but Elizabeth herself gets off on quite the wrong foot with Bingley's handsome but standoffish friend, Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen).As Elizabeth and Darcy start their convoluted, sour-sweet courtship, events swiftly etch the novel's main developments. Elizabeth becomes interested in a dashing soldier, Lt. Wickham (Rupert Friend), who has an awkward history with Darcy; meanwhile, she's pursued by a boring reverend, William Collins (Tom Hollander).Initial set of romantic entanglements comes memorably together at the 35-minute mark in another, much more upscale ball, this time at Bingley's residence. Helmer Wright's use of long steadicam sequences and Moggach's ability to keep a large number of characters on the boil come into their own here. Elaborately but not showily choreographed, and giving the viewer a precise sense of social geography within the interlinked rooms, it's the movie's set piece, as Elizabeth negotiates advances from both Collins and Darcy.Picture starts to tighten the emotional screws just prior to the hour mark, with the first entry of romantic piano-and-strings scoring. Darcy's passionate proposal, and Elizabeth's equally passionate rejection, show both actors at the top of their game, emotionally fueling the long final act and coda.Looking every bit a star, Knightley, who's shown more spirit than acting smarts so far in her career, really steps up to the plate here, holding her own against the more classically trained Macfadyen (as well as vets like Blethyn, Sutherland and Judi Dench) with a luminous strength that recalls a young Audrey Hepburn. More than the older Ehle in the TV series, she catches Elizabeth's essential skittishness and youthful braggadocio, making her final conversion all the more moving. Thesp's only weakness is her over-clipped delivery, more Kensington than rural Hertfordshire.Macfadyen makes Darcy a more conflicted, softer figure than Firth's indelibly etched performance, but one that fits the movie's more realistic mood.Other casting is aces down the line, with Blethyn reining back her Mrs. Bennet into a believable mother hen, Sutherland overcoming a sometimes wobbly English accent in a performance that pays dividends at the end (in a beautiful scene with Knightley), and Dench perking up the picture at key moments as a waspishly commanding Lady Catherine.Mass of smaller roles add texture to every scene, increasing the sense of ensemble and keeping the screen busy. Pike's well-meaning Jane is a touching study in selflessness, while Kelly Reilly's Caroline Bingley brings a tart sexual jealousy to her early scenes with Macfadyen and Knightley.Film's most controversial changes are in the characters of Collins and Bingley, both of whom are used for comic relief. But despite being completely different from the novel's Collins, both physically and emotionally -- as well as being considerably older -- Hollander does make the role work dramatically in Moggach's condensation, allowing modern audiences a way into the social rituals without direct satire.Amazingly, given the book's enduring popularity, this is only the second big screen version of the novel, 65 years after MGM's Greer Garson-Laurence Olivier black & white production, typical of studio-bound English literature productions of the period. Current production was entirely filmed on location, using a variety of period structures all around England.",,Anonymous,Romance
What a great story,"I loved reading this book back in high school. Such a rich story with very memorable characters. I've found that, at times, adapting such books into films can result in a compressed and brief run through the key points of the story. This detracts from what could be, in a fleshed out and comfortable pace for the story to be told. This film suffers a bit from that, though, overall does great justice to the novel. Great casting and set designs. I would recommend this to fans of this great book and period romances.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

My new favourite film,I have only just watched this version in 2023. I avoided watching it because I thought there could only ever be one Mr Darcy. I am of the age that swooned over Colin Firth diving into that pond. How wrong I was.This version is a pure delight from beginning to end. Lavish in a way that depicts the times. Beautiful costumes and houses. Stunning countryside.Crammed with excellent actors that were familiar or became more familiar in later years. Loved 'Vera' as Mrs Bennett. And Kelly Reilly's performance as Caroline Bingley a far cry from her Beth DuttonDonald Sutherland was perfectly cast as Mr Bennett. Rosamund Pike is believable as the beautiful Jane.My notion that there is only one Mr Darcy is totally blown away. The chemistry between Kiera Knightly and Matthew Macfadyen is almost palpable. It's a beautiful love story told very well.It will not belong before I watch it again.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
another (long) Austen tale.,"This one has been done so many times. in this version, with numerous oscar nominees, Keira Knightly is proud, eligible young lass, Elizabeth Bennet. Donald Sutherland is Pop Bennet, trying to get his daughters married off properly. Matthew Macfadyen is the delightful Mr. Darcy, but... of course, he's enamored with someone else. bad timing. a familiar story. alliances and decisions in the matchmaking department. much talking and debating about the virtues and strengths that make a person whole. honor is everything. when honor is not respected, Elizabeth takes is seriously. and sometimes completely misunderstood. funny scene where mom and all the sisters come to present themselves to Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy. this one has lots of humor to it, but I'll leave it to the reader to spot those scenes. some are just camera close-ups. it's good, and tells a story. of course, it's a Jane Austen story. Directed by Joe Wright, who seems to like the more serious projects... Anna Karenina, P & P, Atonement. it's quite good. Long but good, at 129 minutes.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A waste of time,"Keira Knightly (Elizabeth Bennet) cheesy smiled and giggled her way through whole movie. Although she was the best of a bad bunch she did not portray the Elizabeth Bennet of the Austin novel  never even came close.Matthew MacFadyen would have been better cast as one of the un-dead in Land of the Dead movie as his acting was as wooden as a flesh eating zombie.Simon Woods (Mr Bingley) with his crop of ginger hair and imbecilic smile. Did the makers of this movie really expect us to believe that a beautiful woman like Jane Bennet could ever fall in love with such a piece of quivering, stuttering jelly? Donald Sutherland (Mr Bennet) looked like he was one step away from insanity. I was half expecting to see him eat the dragon fly he was examining in his study.Not only did Mr Bennet act like he was one step away from the mental institution two of his daughters giggled like half wits through the whole movie to thus convince me insanity ran in the family.The 5th daughter looked so depressed throughout the movie I was half expecting the director to take liberties with the Austin novel and insert a scene where the rest of the family found her hanging from the rafters.And Mr.Wickham? He was in the movie? Where? When? Apparently he was only given a cameo part to allow more time for the director to focus on bare butts of statutes in Darcy's home.This movie was a torturous mess from beginning to end.

Excellent remake of a remade remake.,"The lighting, costume design and art direction alone make this film a standout, but also the cinematography and editing match the material and make this ""timeless"" film highly entertaining.In Joe Wright's high-end retelling of the story, a young woman at the lowest, and most economically vulnerable end of the landed gentry of early 1800's England, must find a suitable partner. The man she finds is basically a total asshat, but as the plot unfolds, it's revealed that the negative allegation's made against him aren't actually true, and although his family would forbid it, he's prepared to transcend the class structure of his era for ""pure love"".Keira Knightley is effortlessly beautiful in every scene, even when she falls in the mud or throws a tantrum, she basically grits into a photogenic grimace, and her 'petulant' look somewhat betrays the underlying entitlement of the actress.The weather is perfect in every scene though and every prop, costume piece, window frame and even sagging, unappealing street view looks like a work of art.The film's romantic core is something of a contradiction; ultimately, Bennett is a sexually attractive woman of lower social standing and the pompous, self-regarding Mr Darcy that loves her has a lot of money and property - making the plot seem somewhat more like a marriage of material gain rather than anything remotely revolutionary.Regardless, generations of new readers pick up Jane Austin's classics, although as a newcomer you can be left wondering a little as to what readers see in their literary hero's concept; Austin's story is essentially a film about a women's lack of self-determination in an era before any real political and labor representation, and the film wallows in the pretensions and resentments of Britain's entrenched class system of yore. Thank god for the Sex Pistols.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Tad Overrated, but Still a Fun Time","I don't really have a least favourite genre, but if I was pressed to say one I'd probably say romance. Not rom-com, just straight romance with little humour in it. Don't get me wrong, there are some great romance films, with WALL-E, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Beauty and the Beast being some of my all time favourites, but it's generally just a genre I don't really enjoy as much as others. This meant that, despite the high average rating, I didn't have particularly high hopes for this film. But with that said, I did like it. Now the first half was a lot worse than the second half in my opinion. Too much nothingness in the story and I was starting to lose interest in the characters. The performances and direction was still good, I just found myself a tad bored. Thankfully, around the part where they have the argument in the rain, the film turned around and became a lot more emotionally satisfying. The ending tied everything up really well and the romances between the characters felt a lot better in the second half of the film. Kiera Knightly is obviously great as ever, and the second half was just a lot more engaging than the first. I can definitely see how so many people love this, and whilst I don't on the same level as everyone else, I still enjoyed it and would recommend it, particularly to fans of the romance genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Difference in Scenery,"Unarguably, scenery and location is important to this story. While I feel like lots of the scenery and locations of the book were well represented in the movie I feel like there were some locations that didn't quite match up with the book. The house of the Bennet family was represented as much poorer than what I feel was described by Jane Austen. I also feel like many scenes took place in a different location than mentioned in the book. Along with the differences of scenery, some scenes and events that occurred in the movie were not anywhere in the book.

I guess I was expecting a lot but for me I feel the movie failed to deliver to my expectations. I found the storyline rather choppy; jumping from one plot to another without warning. People who have not read the novel would find it rather confusing. I watched the movie with my sister-in-law and I ended up having to explain to her the plot because she couldn't make head or tail of it. The movie which had Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy was better; in terms of storyline and acting. I am surprised that Keira Knightley was actually nominated for and Oscar for her role as Elisabeth Bennet. The storyline never really truly allowed her to shine.,,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyable but too short,"I viewed this movie with eager anticipation, and while it was wonderful to see Jane Austen's characters come to life on the big screen, I was disappointed. Firstly the movie went for only 2 hours, not nearly long enough to do justice to the development of the characters and story lines in the book. Being a great fan of the book, I was annoyed that some elements had been completely changed or even omitted. Keira Knightley does justice to Elizabeth's character, however Matthew MacFadyen is neither arrogant or proud enough to be a true representation of Mr Darcy. The stately homes and scenery certainly impressed me, but failed to make up for a storyline that was certainly lacking. The love story between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy is enjoyable to watch, but overall, I feel the movie is not an adequate adaptation of the novel.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

inexplicably ordinary,"I first have to say that Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite novels, to compare this movie to the novel is incomprehensible, Jane Austen would be rolling over in her grave at this thought. I was expecting something as wonderful as the A&E version, and received a poorly acted piece of trash. Elizabeth is a strong character with slight nuances that intrigue; Keira Knightley showed little enthusiasm for the character, actually she had the same facial expression throughout the entire movie.The final impression of the movie is that it was purely to show off Keira Knightley, with superfluous scenes of her looking pensive (but somehow pensive looks the same as anger, happiness, and love... interesting).

A worthy adaption,"Having watched the 1995 mini series many times i was unsure of what to expect in the 2005 version of 'Pride and Prejudice.' I feel, that for a film, it did the book justice as there is so little time to fit in everything that takes place. However it felt very hurried and the script was atrocious at some points. I also felt the choice of actors for Mr Darcy, Lydia Bennet, Mr Bennet and Lady Cathrine were very poor and that neither did their character justice.Perhaps this was due to the time limit of the film meaning they were harder to portray. I think if less well known actors/actresses had been used in the film it would have been slightly more believable and i wouldn't have thought of them as themselves but as the characters they were actually portraying.I am only 16 years old and think the film is well worth a watch if you don't have time to watch the 1995, 5 hour version. Many people my age have said they thought the film was rubbish which i think is a shame as 'Pride and Prejudice' is an amazing love story and they most probably will not be inclined to watch Colin Firth and Jennifer Elle or read the book.Perhaps i didn't enjoy the film as much as other people because i had seen the BBC series but i could definitely sit down and watch it again!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

A rush job,"I have been a fan of Jane Austin since seeing the BBC version of this film that was produced in 1980. Since then I have read all of her books and seen any film version of them that has been done. I'm afraid that my benchmark for any filmed version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" will always be the 1995 BBC production and this one suffers by comparison.For those who have never read the book or seen the other productions you may not understand this but trying to fit it into 2 hours simply doesn't work. I feel as though I'm being rushed through the story and being allowed to see only the highlights. In some places, the missing pieces of the story make it is hard to understand characters' motivations.The style of this film helps make the rush job more interesting. It is similar to the '95 Roger Michel version of ""Persuasion"" in that the England that we see on the screen is down to earth and very real. You can almost see the paint moldering in the elderly and somewhat decaying Longbourne. At times though, Wright does throw a little romance and mysticism into it with his use of color and light. The English landscape seems much more lush and green than one would have thought, and the glow of candles is warm and comforting.Another interesting element is the intimate way in which we are invited into the lives of the Bennets through the use of camera work. In fact, it's almost a little too intimate for the fans of Austin and in some ways for the period as well. Some of the characters appear rumpled and disheveled and a good bit of the action takes place at convenient times for the girls to be found in their nightclothes. There is also a more relaxed attitude in relationships than it was usually acceptable to have at that time.As for the performances, while most tend to be good, the majority of the performers bring nothing new to characters of the book. Tom Hollander is an exception to this in that his characterization of Collins puts a somewhat different spin on a character usually portrayed as bumbling and comically condescending. Hollander's Collins comes across as bland, arrogant, and practical to a fault. He sees the value of currying favor with the wealthy and believes that others of his class should follow his example.On the flip side, Matthew MacFadyen's performance of Darcy left a little something to be desired. He lacks the classical brooding handsomeness that one associates with Darcy and his performance is sometimes awkward. Some of his problem might be the script in that it is sometimes hard to understand how he forms some of his opinions when you are not seeing everything that you should in the story.All in all, this is not a bad film. It simply does not meet the standard that has been set for it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's fun but it's not Jane Austen,"""Pride and Prejudice (1940) -- This literate movie is a reasonably faithful transcription of Jane Austen's sparkling comedy of manners. . .but when Jane Austen's characters are brought to life at M-G-M, all is changed -- broadened. Animated and bouncing, the movie is more Dickens than Austen""That's Pauline Kael on the 1940 Laurence Olivier, Greer Garson version with ""that great old dragon Edna May Oliver, as Lady Catherine."" Kael's description of the 1940 movie works pretty well as a template for the new Keira Knightley-Joe Wright Pride and Prejudice. This time the ""old dragon"" is Judi Dench. We can't say Wright's version belongs to Darcy, because it hasn't got Olivier: Mathtew MacFayden is strong enough, but no Olivier. The movie belongs, as it should, to Elizabeth Bennett, and hence to the charming, pretty Keira Knightley. It's also, like the 1940 one, ""changed -- broadenedanimated and bouncing."" ""More Dickens than Austen"" won't work, and the recent critic exaggerated a bit who said this new movie is Austen ""Brontëfied,"" and so did the one who called it ""a film that turns Jane Austen's nimble satire into a lumbering Gothic romance."" But they're all onto something -- something that's not there.Not quite Brontëfied or Gothic, this new Pride and Prejudice has definitely been romanticized, and more than that it's had the essential elements of Jane Austen taken out. Austen's elaborate irony and rational thinking, and most of her beautiful and elegant sentences -- the essence of her books -- are all excised in favor of bouncy dancing and vivid color photography and nice-looking people -- very nice-looking ones, with nice period clothes, who more often than not overlap voices Altman style or just interrupt each other.And since we don't have to hear all that's said, the gaps are filled in with surging strings and powerful piano music, music no instrument in 1821 could have come close to matching. These movie ladies sit down to their little period pianofortes -- and out comes Jean-Yves Thibaudet playing a modern Steinway concert grand. True, Jane Austen lived at a time when a lot of the great classics were composed, but she lived in the country, far from a symphony orchestra, and it's unlikely she heard anything but a little Hayden and Mozart, maybe, and minor English composers and some Italian songs, all played on an instrument with a relatively very limited sound. And of course though the ladies may have been accomplished, they were not Jean-Yves Thibaudets.The looks are pumped up too, like the sound. The young men are all so handsome or cute the country balls come out looking like ads for Ralph Lauren or Abecrombie & Fitch. The economic levels are exaggerated, so you can't grasp the delicate details of income that are so important in Austen's novels. Lady Catherine's house is as grand as Buckingham Palace, and Darcy's is very nearly that grand. His estate as we see it here would easily have made him one of the half dozen richest men in England. His mansion has a huge sculpture gallery in it like a major room of the British Museum, and the other rooms are decorated with murals that look like the Vatican. At the other extreme, the Bennett girls' surroundings are taken from the Squire in Fielding's Tom Jones as represented in Tony Richardson's movie, with pigs coming into the house, and Mr. Bennett always, always, needing a shave.The irony -- there is one irony, though not in the movie -- is that you can't really make a movie of Jane Austen. Her books are easily visualized on film. Movie makers can come up with the costumes and the sets. But her books aren't essentially visual. They are meant to be read. They're all about prose style, and the turns of phrase that make one think, sentences that flow gently and come down easy, catching you unawares so you may have to read them again, sentences that delineate the development of character through thought and experience with infinite clarity and subtlety. On screen, that development is there, but it's visual. It just happens. The camera just focuses on Ms. Knightley, thinking. But in Jane Austen it happens with words. Ultimately that isn't cinematic. So you can't make a Jane Austen movie without taking out the Jane Austen. Why do people do it, then? Well, people just like to make movies of her books, I guess -- and people like to watch them.Joe Wright's film is fun, but it's not a masterpiece -- or Jane Austen. The directing largely isn't there, not in Jane Austen's terms: character development. Nobody really develops. Mathew MacFadyen is a young man who looks glum, and he looks that way all through. He doesn't really seem haughty and nasty at first, just like a man who can't dance. Keira Knightley is charming -- so is Simon Woods as Bingley, which is fine, because that's all he needs -- but she isn't sharp and she doesn't come through as a keen intelligence or a woman who is transformed. What Joe Wright's good at is getting a bouncy, sweaty bunch of good-looking people out on a dance floor in a stately home, and walking folks across pretty English landscapes. Walks in Jane Austen are about talk, or economics, like everything else. But in Joe Wright's film they're about sweeping strings and Chopin. Everybody is too nice, except the tiresome Mrs. Bennett -- though Brenda Blethyn is okay, not a caricature as some have said. My regret is that Donald Sutherland's smiley and weepy Mr. Bennett isn't drier and more ironic. Like everybody else in the movie, except Lady Catherine, he's been made likable, at the expense of Jane Austen's wit.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
No Great Impact,"Some people say that we have to see this new adaptation with an open mind and that we should not compare this to that of the previous adaptations but why not?

It was a perfect interpretation and Colin Firth as Mr Darcy is spot on.Watching the series made me read the book and until now It still affects me every time I watch it. Mathew Macfadden is not Mr Darcy , he is too crumpled and too soft to be Mr Darcy.He is not proud enough and Keira is not strong enough to be an intelligent Lizzie. The whole film is just not PnP.

"Excellent, magically romantic rendition.","I have over the past few months read many comments about the 2005 rendition of Pride and Prejudice. I confess that I only read the book after seeing the 2005 version of the movie and only watched the 5/6 hour mini series after seeing the movie and my take on it is that Joe Wright and the entire cast of the 2005 movie has delivered a Platinum performance.I have watched both the A&E series and the 2005 movie multiple times and this evening after watching both again, the movie at the local theater and the TV series on DVD this evening, the realization struck me so clearly as to why I LOVE the 2005 movie so much more than the TV series.It all comes down to the very tangible emotion in the movie. Both Keira and Matthew just ooze with that incredible emotion/feeling  you can see it in their faces, in their body language, the way they speak, expressions, it's all there! And let's not throw away or forget about the supporting cast. I just love Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet, and Brenda Blethyn makes Mrs. Bennet so believable without making the character a whiny really irritating entity. She is fun to watch and she is so good. And the three younger sisters were cast so well  Kitty and Lydia are so much fun you cannot help giggling along with them! There is also the sisterly love between Jane and Lizzie that is almost tangible. It is real and when I watched the affection between them I missed my own sister so very much.When I watched the TV series that is what I found so lacking and maybe that is more true to the time that the book is based in but the movie still just wins hands down.A good romance is said to have intense conflict and then intense resolution and we have that in the movie but I feel not in the TV series. Colin Firth is good and though Jennifer Ehle is pretty to a degree, her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet held nothing for me  I found her portrayal of the character bland and somewhat patched, lacking the spirit and fire that Keira Knightley brought to Lizzie, Jennifer Ehle for me by no means brings the kind of fire to the screen that Keira did. Keira in my opinion is the most like the Elizabeth Bennet I imagined when I read the book. And together Keira and Matthew brought Lizzie and Darcy to life, and as Joe Wright said, ""when he was as Darcy and she was Lizzie, something happened and they were just perfect together."" That is what I felt when I watched the movie, each time I watched and I have seen it probably about a dozen times now.I love romantic stories and I loved this one  the direction was excellent. Joe Wright seems young for a director with such vision, so a job well done, I believe. The cinematography was fantastic  different and beautiful.It is well to remember that every movie cannot please every individual who watches it, and if I did not like the kind of romantic tales that just melt your heart and make you appreciate the romance you have with your own partner, then I would still rate this movie as excellent for a great story, well told, and beautifully presented.I learned that the UK has some really beautiful scenery and it was wonderful to get a glimpse inside the elegant homes that one mostly just hear of.All in all for me the best movie of 2005!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I myself enjoy the US ending, but actually wanted more still. This is DARCY, dang it! After all that teasing, I want more than a few kisses around the face!!! Definitely more. Having said that, the US ending allowed us to imagine what may come next, since we get to finally see Darcy in his most romantic mode. What's wrong with that? I have loved this book since I first read it 30 yrs ago and I visit it often. Jane Austen successfully conveyed what could be written in her times, with enough undercurrents that any remake has many avenues to take if they want to develop ideas and take the audience in other directions. Such a small book with such a big heart! I thoroughly enjoy the 1995 miniseries version and find it a classic. It (and Colin Firth, of course!) is my benchmark. So I watched the 2005 movie with a bit of trepidation, especially with such a stylized set-up and the two main characters appearing to have to take a big stretch to reach their roles, Especially Matthew MacFadyen. But then, I had read that his version would win you over as you saw the character develop. I am very pleased to say, I could see that and enjoyed the film. Finally seeing him not be shy, in the US ending, really gave him depth and allowed us to see just HOW MUCH Elizabeth could be happy with him. And - although it left me wanting to see more - it gave me visions to dream about. And THAT is truly a successful ending to a film - that it allows you to carry it with you long after the movie is over.My only other observations are: 1. I didn't get why she ran to that building in the rain and how Darcy happened to go there, too. Did I miss something or was it a coincidence? Any to see romantic turbulence in drenching rain! 2. I was able to enjoy how Mrs Bennet really loved her daughters and was driven by the despair of having five daughters to marry off, with three of them appearing ""unmarriable"" with their personalities.I was able to dislike her less. 3. What a nice surprise in Donald Southerland's version of Mr Bennet. His last scenes were so heartwarming. But I'm glad I have the DVD that didn't end it there! (Ladies, all together: Darcy! Darcy! Darcy!)And to my fellow Austenites, it's a pleasure to read your views on this story. As a foreign language teacher, I push Jane Austen on my students constantly even though it's not in my curriculum, so as to have them get a feel of what life was like in the early 1800's. You prove that this book is alive and well.Take care, Ivette",,Anonymous,Romance
Not Proud And Hardly Prejudiced,"Before I say anything, I have to mention that I'm a huge fan of the famous 1995 BBC mini-series adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I own it on DVD, and I've watched the entire series several times from start to finish. It's by far the best adaptation of a Jane Austen novel I've ever seen. Therefore, I may be a little bit subjective, but I try not to keep comparing the movie to the fantastic TV-series.Pride and Prejudice is based on Jane Austen's classic novel about five young sisters whose mother desperately tries to marry off to wealthy men to avoid a future of poverty and loneliness, the witty second-born Elizabeth being the protagonist. The sisters' luck seems to turn when two such men, the cheerful Mr. Bingley and the haughty Mr. Darcy, enter their lives. While Mr. Bingley courts Elizabeth's beautiful older sister Jane, Elizabeth finds herself clashing with Mr. Darcy, an immensely proud man who seems impossible to please, but who turns out to conceal a gentleman Elizabeth is too prejudiced to see.The plot is faithful enough to the original novel, so one can't really blame the story for not being interesting enough. However, it is still much less compelling than any other adaptation of the novel. Why? Because it completely overlooks the central dilemma of Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's relationship - that they can't be together until Mr. Darcy stops being too proud to treat Elizabeth and her family with the respect they deserve, and Elizabeth stops being too prejudiced to see past the false rumours and misunderstandings which have stained her opinion of Mr. Darcy. On the contrary to the book, the movie's Mr. Darcy appears to fall for Elizabeth at first glance, displaying none of the disdain the original character regards her with when they first meet. Their love is shown beginning with immediate mutual attraction, instead of being shown as something they both grow into once they get over themselves. There's no pride, and hardly any prejudice, both of which are essential to the character development. Hence title, Wright, hence the title.Now, I'm not someone who gets overly obsessed with staying loyal to the original source when translating novels into the silver screen. I don't mind changes because I understand that movies and books are two different mediums. In fact, I fully embrace even the boldest changes when they improve the quality of the movie. However, the tiny little thing changed in Pride and Prejudice is simply unacceptable because it destroys the tension between Elizabeth and Darcy, which is a crucial element in their story.The casting is also all wrong. While I personally didn't mind Keira Knightley's bubbly take on Elizabeth Bennet, I cannot over-emphasize how bad Matthew Macfadyen is as Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy is a strong, supercilious man whose arrogant exterior conceals a respectful, honest heart. Matthew Macfadyen's Darcy seems like a brooding, insecure teenage boy with a dull, sheepish, submissive look in his eyes. His acting is wooden, every word he speaks is empty, and there isn't a hint of the character's defining traits about him. This is where I absolutely must make a comparison with Macfadyen and Colin Firth, who portrayed the same character in the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice. Where the superb Firth was able to inject the battle of pride and passion which rages inside Mr. Darcy when he finds himself falling for a woman who he considers unworthy of him in a single look, Macfadyen cannot channel his character's emotions even when he's pouring out his soul to his beloved. With a leading man like him, how could the movie work?While I personally quite like Joe Wright's way of portraying the hot, lazy summer days in the lush English countryside, he doesn't have much to offer than some breath-taking shots of the surrounding nature that aren't enough to compensate the movie's flaws. Most of the time he seems rather clueless about the story he's telling, struggling especially with dialog-heavy scenes. I much preferred his next title, Atonement, a movie similar in style but remarkably advanced in quality.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A magical movie,"I don't know enough about movie-making to understand what it is that makes a movie a magical experience. But this is surely one of them.Every scene, every character, every frame of the movie seems to be perfectly crafted. Is it the direction, is it the camera-work or is it the actors? Certainly, in my view, the pride of place must go to Lizzie Bennett, played by the absolutely gorgeous Keira Knightley. She is more than outstanding and the costumes, sets and locations seem to be just right for her. I don't think anyone else could have achieved what she has done here.Add to that the landscapes which are lovingly captured by director Joe Wright and cameraman Roman Oshin and you have the perfect movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A good movie, but not the quintessential P&P","I went to this movie (presently in limited release here in Los Angeles) with what I hope was an open mind, even though I'm a big fan of the 1995 BBC production. I did enjoy it on the whole, but I do have some reservations. For instance, I can understand why many things had to be compressed because of the shorter length of the movie, but why did they decide to set it in an earlier period than Austen intended? I love the elegance of the BBC production--elegant homes, elegant clothing, elegant dancing. This production featured a lot of noise and a lot of bouncing around (intentional because of the period, I understand).I thought Keira Knightley made an excellent Lizzie, though. She has that rare luminescent quality that makes the screen hers alone whenever she's in a scene. But I didn't care for Matthew MacFadyen as Darcy. He seemed mostly sad, rather than mysterious and brooding, and wasn't in my opinion handsome enough for Darcy (although he does have beautiful eyes).Oh, for Colin Firth and that impromptu dive into the lake!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Truly awful,"It takes a lot of effort and determination to turn Austen's superb novel into something truly awful. The producers, writers, director, and cast of PP2005 have managed to do just that. If you cherish the novel, don't go see this movie. If you love movies, give this one a miss. If you're feeling optimistic about the state of the arts in our time, go see this movie - you'll be cured of your optimism for a long time to come. When I had finished watching this movie I felt like undergoing ritual flagellation.I couldn't find a single thing to like about this movie. It's completely over the top. From the ball, where a few fiddlers and flutists manage to sound like an 80 piece orchestra, to Blethyn's tedious and patented hysterical mother, to Dench's absurd Lady de Bourgh, to the hysteria of the five sisters, to earsplitting cacophony of the five Bennett sisters in full cackle, to Knightly's vacuous face, to . . . words fail me.I'd give the movie a zero if I could. Pace, Miss Austen; this too will pass.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
No Words Can Describe This Movie,"No words can describe this movie and still give it justice. While it does cut a lot from the novel, I never read it so it doesn't bother me.I watched the 1995 mini-series and thought it was a complete bore. It almost turned me off to seeing this movie. Almost.When I did see this movie I was treated to laughs, characters I could watch and believe and a story that was not only easy to follow, but pulled me in. I could see that Darcy and Elizabeth really liked each other, and I was left screaming at my television while watching how they interacted. It was like ""What is wrong with you, you like him, so tell him!"" Keira Knightely did an amazing job as the softer yet still tough Lizze. Most of the rolls Keira takes seem to be showing a more rougher and bad ass version of women, but she pulled this off amazingly well. Matthew Macfayden was exactly what Darcy should be, he was stoic and proud and rigid, yet he still was able to show how he felt for Lizzie with real emotions. Rosamund Pike (Jane) is a timeless beauty. Nobody in today's era could possibly pull off Jane the way Rosamund did.I can find nothing bad to say about this movie. I loved the chemistry between Keira and Matthew as well as Rosamund and Simon. I hated Mr. Whickham, but at the beginning when he was first mentioned I found him charming and likable. And he was actually attractive, which is more than can be said about the '95 Wickham.If I continue this review it will take up two pages, I loved this movie. If you wish to see a version of Pride and Prejudice with emotion and likable characters, I strongly suggest you see this movie. It is a beautiful and amazing adaptation.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's not the book, it's a film so enjoy it for what it is.","There are very occasions where a film surpasses a book and this does not change with Pride and prejudice. The only film i can think of off the top of my head is Jaws. However, we as the audience have to accept this and move on. Adapting romantic novels is especially hard as there is little action to speak of. Therefore the story must be altered slightly, hence adaptation. The Jane Austin purists may, and probably will despise this film. However all good adaptation's are not completely accurate otherwise they would on the whole be boring. To cover the novel in more depth would take hours.This film should be enjoyed for what it is: beautifully shot, well directed and superbly acted. Kiera Knightley is superb as Elizabeth and is well supported by Brenda Blethyn, Donald Sutherland and Mathew Macfadyen. However, the film is almost stolen by the surprisingly brilliant Tom Hollander who plays the sleazy Mr Collins. One point which has been widely criticised is the state of the Bennet household and the fact they have no servants. Yes this may be inaccurate however, it does give leverage for Mrs Bennet to be far more loopy than in the novel which Brenda Blethyn does superbly.This film was always going to have its lovers and its haters. But when you watch this film just watch it for what it is, an accomplished piece of film making.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A bright, sparkling adaptation","I have to say that when I first heard they were remaking Pride and Prejudice, I was a bit incredulous. I've read P&P once a year, every year, since I was 12, and since seeing the 1995 A&E/BBC version, I wondered why another version was even necessary. I thought Kiera Knightly could probably pull off Elizabeth, but had never heard of Matthew Macfadyen...and who could compare to to Colin Firth?But, never one to miss an interpretation of P&P, I went and saw it in the theater. And I had to admit, rather quickly, that it was exceptionally well-done. Not perfect, but in the short run time, they managed to fit a lot in, as well as convey some things that, frankly, didn't make it into 1995's near-perfect film. For one, the book leaves you with the impression that the Bennett family, while capable of employing servants, are not exceptionally wealthy. In the 1995 version, I was surprised at how, well, more than middle class they appeared. In this version, though, Longbourne looks more how like I always pictured it in the book: a bit shabby and lived in, but home. I was also impressed with the assembly in this version. It's fast and loud, joyful and infectious, and it truly conveys why the 5 Bennett girls enjoy dancing so much.But the true surprise was Matthew MacFadyen. As Darcy, he grew on me, almost as Darcy grows on Elizabeth, becoming more handsome as the movie progressed. MacFadyen lends an intensity to Darcy that (and I never thought I'd admit something like this) Colin Firth's portrayal lacked. One of the touches of MacFadyen's Darcy that I particularly liked were his stutters in both proposals. Things become more real when you say them out loud, and here is a man, declaring his love to a woman that his entire upbringing has told his is beneath his notice...it's part nerves, partly (at least in the first proposal) fighting against himself, and it just worked.The secondary supporting cast are all fantastic: Tom Hollander's Collins is less simpering, Dame Judy Dench's Lady Catherine is more imperious, Wickham is more handsome than his 1995 mini-series counterpart (so it's more obvious why Elizabeth is initially attracted to him), and Charlotte Lucas shows more of the desperation of her situation.Overall, I loved it, just as much as the 1995 version, and it's found a home in my DVD collection, right alongside the mini-series. I think Jane would be pleased as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
This will bewitch you body and soul,"First of all, let me say up front, that I am not a real movie critic. I LOVED IT! YES, it was an abridged version. They cut here and there, but for a FEATURE FILM, it was more than tolerable (said with a Darcy accent). In fact, it was BEAUTIFUL. The cinematography was exquisite. The dancing and lighting were lovely. The camera angles were clever. The mood shots were inspiring.Not to mention, I thought Keira Knightly was a LOVELY Elizabeth Bennet! I loved her scenes with Donald Sutherland. I have been looking forward to him playing Mr. Bennet since I first heard of the project about 1 1/2 years ago. He was great at the part.In fact, I thought all the acting was well-done. The Darcy was no Colin Firth, but their on-screen chemistry was palpable, and I was caught up in the splendor of Austen's world ONCE more in this new version.Bottom line is that nothing will compare to the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version; but this new installment isn't a mini-series. So, for a feature film and taken as a feature film, it does Austen proud.IMHONow, I start my Thanksgiving weekend in perfect felicity for the movie has ""bewitched me body and soul.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Watchable, but nothing compared to the 1995 mini series","Not that bad of a movie, but compared to the BBC mini series made in 1995, the movie falls short. The characters just aren't as nicely worked out. Mr. Darcy is far too nice throughout the whole thing and Mrs. Bennet isn't wacky enough. I also thought some plot twists were left out and oversimplified.Also, the whole movie seemed rather slow to me. And I know that's not due to the story. I think the slowness is partly due to the many arty farty camera shots. Lots of scenery. A shot of Lizzie sitting on a swing, spinning around (which i didn't really understand the point of).Last but not least, the ending made no sense at all to me. It was a very weird way to end the movie, in my opinion.The whole movie was a bit too Hollywoodian for my tastes. The story is still brilliant, and the scenery was nice, so 6 out of 10 for that. It's worth a look if you haven't read the book and want a nicely polished up, modern version of the story. But if you want to see good actors, in a good film that's true to the story and the time the book was written in: go and watch the mini series. It's much nicer.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
beautifully shot romance,"I haven't read the book yet and I haven't seen the BBC series yet. Maybe that is why I really enjoyed this movie. I can't judge how near this movie is to the book and honestly - I don't care. All I can say is that:(1) This movie is so beautifully shot that my mother (who is an artist drawing water color pictures) couldn't stop raving about the cinematography.(2) I found the love story to be interesting, dramatic and fulfilling.(3) The soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous. The violin in the Darcy/Lizzie dance scene was another actor for me (it kind of added an additional layer to the scene which showed what Liz' comments did to Darcy's heart) and almost made me cry when I watched the movie the 2nd time.(4) The acting is superb.Overall a very enjoyable experience. I can strongly recommend this movie to all people who like romantic movies. I do not recommend this movie to people who have read the book and cannot forgive modifications to it. And I can also not recommend this movie to people who've seen the BBC series and are not willing to accept that a 2 hour movie has less time to develop the characters than a 5 hour mini series has.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pride and Prejudice 2005,"I was so anxious to see this movie. First, I must say that I enjoyed how they re-enacted the period. The style, grit, earthiness was interesting and the scenic shots were breath taking, but...the acting left much to be desired. On the way home we decided that Keira Knightly (Elizabeth Bennet) was impersonating Winona Rider as Jo in Little Women. She lacked the elegance of the Elizabeth we are accustomed to in the A&E version of P & P and she was much too silly. Elizabeth and Jane were almost as giddy as Lydia and Kitty, which did not give the contrast that Jane Austen must have intended in her beloved novel. To the untrained eye it was a fun movie and Keira Knightly is energetic and beautiful to watch. To the pure Jane Austen fan this version lacks the true dialogue and the tweaking of the story was ridiculous. For example having Elizabeth blurt out to Mr.Darcy that dancing would not be fun even if he had a partner that could tempt him. Paaaleeeze. AND they cut out some of the best lines! ""If you had behaved in a more gentleman-like manner!"" The Mr.Collins character was rather believable and Dame Judy Dench as Lady Catherine worked well and I would have liked to see her in more scenes. They took poetic license a bit too far by having Bingley come into Jane's room while she was sick to check on her. That would not be done in Austen's book! They had Elizabeth walking outside in her nightgown because she could not sleep and Darcy meeting her at sunrise as he was walking. NEVER. Let alone the ending with the silly kissing scene at Pemberly. I did have fun seeing this with a friend who knows the story and the A&E version inside and out. We chuckled and annoyed all those around us. My husband commented that it was like watching The Lord of the Rings Trilogy cut down to a two-hour movie It felt like it was in fast forward. Recently I read many reviews declaring this version was Brontëfied with sweeping landscapes and lacking the incredible dialogue. I am amiss to why they bothered to film this movie when the A&E version is so utterly superior and true to the book. I just hope that anyone who has seen this production will be interested in reading the book and/or watching the A&E version to be completely caught up with the true story and the fascinating dialogue that Jane Austen is famous for.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worst Version Ever,"i don't think i have ever seen a worse version of one of Jane Austens classics. Not only is this film confused about which time period its meant to be in, but the story has been mutilated beyond comprehension, if it hadn't been for the title at the start of the film i would have thought i'd walked into the wrong screen, and i cant think of a worse actress to play ELizabeth Bennett than Keira Knightley. Pride and Prejudice is not only my favourite book but the Colin Firth version is also my favourite drama and Elizabeth Bennett a strong character with a certain essence and intelligence which Knightley was incapable of bringing to the fore. And as a lover of Jane Austens work i have to say i couldn't be more disappointed with this film and any one who loves Pride and Prejudice should stay well clear of this so called re-telling of Jane Austens classic.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A well crafted and acted historical romance,"Having not previously read the book or seen the mini-series (a limited education and no time for television), I saw the movie with no pride or prejudice. With cinematic preferences tending toward contemporary life, plots and action, my wife had to drag me to this film. I'm glad she did. The movie transports you to a time and place where you feel the moods and care about the characters. Beautiful scenery, emotive music, great architecture and excellent acting made for thoroughly enjoyable entertainment. Keira Knightley, perfect for the role, transparently illuminates her thoughts and emotions. Others in the cast fit their parts well, except for Donald Sutherland's pearly white teeth, an intrusion of this century into the 18th, which the film otherwise believably transports us into. Great scenes include the dance hall sequences, the proposals, and Judi Dench's nighttime visit. The final scene, however, seemed unnecessary. After seeing the movie, I watched the five-hour television series and read the four hundred page book. What's clear is that more can be shown in five hours than two and a book is a different experience than a film. The film is great on its own and, in two hours, is as good an adaptation as the novel will probably ever get.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not enough of it!,"It was a great pity that there were only two hours of it. I would have liked to watch at least another hour of Joe Wright beautifully directed Pride and Prejudice. As I did not see the other one made for the BBC I took the trouble do buy it and last Sunday I watched 8 hours of DVD all together with the 2005 version again. Sorry to say, like many other have said before me, that Mr. Colin Firth fell flat on his nose as he did not have the intensity, the palpable and repressed sexuality of Matthew Macfayden. Keira Knightley was absolutely fascinating, so fresh and genuine; her interpretation of Lizzy is the best I have seen so far ..and I have seen the lot. So what if it was a trifle different from all the others? So much the better. All the other actors so well cast that it was pure entertainment for the eyes to watch them throughout the story telling. The scenery, the photography the stately homes, the balls, the Bennet's house, the country side, everything was so beautiful that my eyes were beaming with joy. Well done! The only lament I can make is the last scene...I would have dearly loved to have seen just a bit more ardor in their embrace.

"overall very good, however the director shouldn't have taken so many liberties with this true classic","Very good considering the fact that it would be physically impossible to do real justice to what is easily one of the greatest literary masterpieces of all time. My biggest complaint was the fact that the director seems to have taken it upon himself to alter the work of the great Jane Austin. The prime example is in the personality of Mrs. Bennet, who in the book is a rather unpleasant, superficial sort of woman and who in the movie (while keeping with the original personality for much of the film) is given several moments in which she comes off as a down to earth and overall entirely tolerable sort of person.

Too much to prove and doesn't quite pull it off,"The problem with attempting to produce a film version of this legendary book, just 10 years after the iconic TV series, is that the film must first of all justify its own existence, and then rise above its predecessors in glorious triumph. Sadly, any adaptation of Pride and Prejudice that reduces itself to 2 hours of screening time will never achieve this feat.Although there were some good performances, and some original takes on the material, director Joe Wright simply shot himself in the foot by his own endeavours. Plastering Kiera Knightley's face on the sides of all the buses in Belfast may be a good ploy to get high box office sales, but you really have to deliver once the tickets are paid for, and sadly this film does not. It is simply too short, and the trailers, which summarise the film in around 30 seconds say it all as to Wright's focus - 'There is one man whom no woman can resist... Mr Darcy!' The film is NOT about Elizabeth Bennet's relationship with Mr Darcy. It is about so much more than that, but the 2 hour time-guillotine means that these extra elements of the Austen's carefully-created society must be cut out, or tailored down to a passing reference, in order to have more time to shoot Elizabeth and/or Darcy brooding over their potential love.The sequence between their meeting at Pemberley up to Lydia's marriage, which happens in literally a minute, is a case in hand. Both Lydia and Wickham (very freshly portrayed by Jena Malone and Rupert Friend) have so much potential to capitalise on their 1995 predecessors (Julia Sawalaha and Adrian Lukis), but the film simply doesn't give them time to talk, let alone shine, as it races through their scandalous alliance in seconds, without explaining why it is such a shocking event, or how it even came about.An interesting innovation of the film is its tendency towards realism, seen in the squalor of Bennet living, pigs with large sperm sacs walking through the house, and a refusal to allow caricature in any of the presentations. Whereas this makes Mrs Bennet an altogether more likable and well-rounded character, it means that comedy elements such as Mr Collins (Tom Hollander) and Lady Catherine de Burgh (Judi Dench) are simply flat and lifeless. Austen's original text relies on the non-realistic elements of satire and caricature to carry those parts, and in this production it is missing.Therefore, the onus is on the leads, Kiera Knightley and Matthew MacFayden, to turn this film from a mediocre remake, into a charming love story. While Knightley is exceptional as Elizabeth Bennet (although supposed attempts to make her unattractive during filming obviously didn't work - an unstraightened fringe is not equivalent to ugliness!), MacFayden fails dismally at his attempts to bring any life or originality into the character of Darcy. He spends most of the first half of the film attempting to look inscrutable but actually looking wet, and the second half of the film attempting to be loving but actually being pathetic. What MacFayden doesn't realise is that Darcy is not Mr nice-but-misunderstood. He IS actually proud and arrogant, and during the course of the plot he MUST go though a reformation. Colin Firth's spectacular 1995 performance managed to epitomise the importance of 'not-acting' a part; Darcy DOES very little, yet the energy needed to play him, and to play everything that is under the surface, is immense. MacFayden merely DOES very little; there is no under-the-surface energy anywhere.Overall, I think this film was more frustrating than disappointing. Aspects of it, such as the realism of setting, and Knightley's amazing lead performance, made me want to see more of it, although to be honest, I don't think I could endure more than 2 hours of Matthew MacFayden bumbling his way through a botched Mr Darcy attempt. Yes, you've guessed it, I am a Jennifer Ehle/Colin Firth/Jane Austen elitist, but not without justification I hope.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"on the whole very good, but weak in places","With the mid-90's TV adaptation of Jane Austen's classic still a favourite in many fan's memories, the motivation for this big screen adaptation is not entirely clear. Nonetheless, it is a very faithful and ultimately enjoyable film. Director Joe Wright presents a visually stunning period piece. The choice of locations provide the ideal backdrop for the drama that unfolds around the central character of Elizabeth Bennet (played surprisingly well by Kiera Knightley) and her sisters. With American film investment, there is the occasional American star. Most notably, Donald Sutherland has been questionably cast as Mr Bennett, the calm father in the centre of the storm created by all the hysterical women in his family. Sutherland plays a different Bennet senior than we are used to, but brings such subtle humour and warmth to the role, you cannot help but appreciate his presence. The women in this film are all fairly standard. The younger and sisters simper and giggle as well as can be expected, and another American Jena Malone as Lydia copes admirably (if a little immaturely) when her character develops a brief storyline of her own. Rosamund Pike plays older bashful sister Jane with a quiet elegance, complimented very well by her suitor Simon Woods, charming to the last as Mr Bingley. By comparison, it is unfortunate the leading male role of Mr Darcy should have gone to Matthew MacFadyen. Comparisons to a certain Mr Firth aside, Mr MacFadyen delivers such a disappointing portrayal of Darcy, that it is only the sheer strength of the other cast members that save him from ruining the film entirely. It is all very well to look moody and raise an eyebrow occasionally, but this is not enough of a performance to give the character any depth, particularly as his love for Elizabeth blossoms. Perhaps it is the fault of the script, but since the rest has been so thoroughly written, this does not seem too likely. And in a standard little cameo, Dame Judi Dench thoughtfully refrains from stealing the scene as Lady Catherine De Bourgh. Having played Queen Elizabeth, Queen Victoria, Lady Bracknell, and 'M' all within recent memory, her performance comes across as a stodgy mix of every formidable battle-axe rolled into one. Hardly stretching her acting muscle, but she is clearly an obvious choice to play her. Take from it what you will. The film has all the right ingredients to do the book justice, with the vast majority of the cast performing brilliantly, no matter what the role. Nearly let down by one or two, it manages to salvage itself from any real embarrassment, and eventually emerges as a very good film indeed.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Pity About Donald Sutherland's Performance,"As soon as I saw Matthew Macfadyen's name as Mr. Darcy, I knew this was going to be good. It is brilliant. A classic story with some great actors.Unfortunately, Donald Sutherland's performance was, in places, very poor. There was one important scene where his words were quite important to the story, and he simply mumbled them all - completely unintelligible. It really was bad, but fortunately he doesn't have a lot to say in other scenes.I don't know why the director didn't ask him to say his lines again - perhaps Sutherland was playing the ""I'm a famous actor"" role and the director was too scared to insist on another take.His elocution was put to shame by just about every one of the rest of the cast. Macfadyen, of course, speaks absolutely perfectly as does Kiera Knightley, so Sutherland's performance next to theirs was made to look even worse.I wonder if there is something wrong with his top teeth - too large or badly fitting dentures? I also noticed that in scenes where he has to laugh, he often covers his mouth as if he is ashamed of his top set of teeth. Very strange.Anyway, try not to think about Sutherland's elocution or top teeth when you're watching this film - it really is brilliant.",,Anonymous,Romance
Good job but the ending....,"I saw this film only few weeks ago and fell in love with it, though I've got some objections to the ending (and even greater to the alternative US ending) which I consider too sweet....Compared to the 1995 miniseries Mr Darcy melts too easily :-)Though both Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen did a great job (especially Matthew must have touched every women's heart I guess:-)) I would say that some changes made were a bit misleading - I mean for example Mary, whose character seems to be much more prim in the original or Mr Collins, who I considered more spiteful (in the book and in the 1995 version) than he was in the 2005 movie. Anyway, as a whole the film is greatly pleasant way of escaping the severe reality of our time:-)and as far as the DVD, I highly appreciate the bonuses which give a even better insight of the Austen's times. If you are a romantic soul be sure to see this film and be sure to see the 1995 miniseries as well - and of course enjoy yourselves!!!:-)",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not Austen,"I didn't see any reason to make another adaptation of PnP after the brilliance of the 1995 mini series unless they are going to make an excellent job and sadly they didn't.The film rushed through at an alarming pace without really getting to know any character. It was slightly sugar coated with complete lack of the classic wit of Jane Austen. The Bennet Family looked poorer than they should. KeiraKnightley's portrayal of Lizzy Bennet is too modern. She grimaces and grins every scene and came across as being so obnoxious. There was no indication that she was witty, particularly intelligent or specially attached to either Jane or her father.The girls giggled a lot.Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet is a disaster. Mrs Bennet is less awful than JA intended.Mr Bingley was played as a complete idiot for cheap laughs. Mathew MacFadyen is more vulnerable than proud,there was no strength of personality. He does not possess the same air of dignity as Colin Firth.This is obviously more of a serious film and the wit and humour of Jane Austen was almost lost in favour of all the melodrama. The best thing about the film is the many pretty English country side.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Comparing movies......,"I liked this movie a lot, granted I have not seen the A&E version, but I did indeed like it better than the novel, which I have only read twice. I enjoyed the novel and saw the movie first. I rarely ever like movies more than books even when I see the movie first, I am an avid reader and have to agree with what someone said, this is a movie based off a book it is not the book turned into a move. Jane Austins book was indeed good, I did enjoy it. Maybe it's because of the fact that I am a romantic, but I have yet to feel the way I do about this movie than any other movie. I have watched it several times and still love it the same, well actually I tend to like it even more, but if you compare this movie to another movie it doesn't do it justice, especially a TV made movie that is 4 hours long, you can do a lot more in 4 hours than in 2 with a book. You may all hate the movie, but I don't feel you gave it a chance by comparing it to another made by someone completely different. If you like the book more then I doubt you will like this movie, it is not completely and utterly closet to the book, but at the same time it truly does give you a hint of what it must have been like. When mere touching was seen as something that was not to be done in public. I much prefer that to the way people act now a days, groping each other and all in public, but anyway think what you like, but comparing a movie to another movie does not do justice to the movie, also A&E is very historically accurate and well a movie isn't always, I enjoy romances and this one by far is my favorite.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

jusco's review: Pride and Prejudice,"Pride and Prejudice, the novel's latest adaptation by Joe Wright, is a delightfully charming film that surprisingly works well for its limited runtime of 129 minutes. I will not compare this film with the ever-faithful, ever-acclaimed 1995 television serial, for both work equally well but just on different levels. The selling point of this film is the fact that it will easily appeal to the younger generation; it is a great introduction for those unfamiliar with the novel or Jane Austen (as it was for me). A modern rendition of the classic novel, it still manages to maintain the wittiness and romance through the impressive performances of the young and attractive actors/actresses.Keira Knightley, one of the most beautiful and talented actresses currently, delivers a pinpoint portrayal of Ms. Elizabeth Bennet that sparkles with witty personality. Her execution and deliverance of the novel's smart, memorable dialogue is spot on – her talent is evident, having able to meet the high standards that have always tagged along with this particular character. Her counterpart, Matthew Macfadyen, does an equally good job as Mr. Darcy, and his transformation throughout the film is well acted. Some may be dissatisfied with the youth or the lack of maturity of the cast, but as mentioned above, being an adaptation aimed at appealing to a younger audience, one must allow proper applause for the cast; it is by no means an easy task to effectively act as a set of defining literary characters.My only complaint was it being too short; there were a few scenes that seemed to arrive much too soon, but it is understandable considering they were trying to compress it into one film. I'll be more than happy to redirect you to the above-mentioned television serial – just under 6 hours, it is given plenty of time for the events to play out.Highly recommended for those who have yet to succeed in sitting through the novel – it is a hilarious and emotion-provoking film – or for those who desire a fresh and lively look at their favourite novel. Highly eloquent, highly intelligent, this modern telling of an all-time classic is worth the watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dazzling To Look At And True To The Book But Needed A Stronger Leading Pair,"Wright's adaptation of Austen's novel is quite true to the book and a much better film compared to the other 'recent' adaptation being Gurinder Chaddha's 'Bride and Brejudice'. The visuals are dazzling and the writing is impressive but at times the pace moves a bit too slow. I liked Wright's attention to the time period as he presents the costumes, the actors' body language, the class distinction, the settings and the language very accordingly. The cinematography, especially the long shots at the party sequence, is brilliant and the score is soothing. Keira Knighley performs better than in any of her other films but she's still miscast. She just doesn't seem to have the suitable nuances that are required to play Lizzie Bennet. Matthew Macfadyen is one of the most unconvincing Darcy's ever (another miscast indeed). He gives the film an unnecessary melodramatic touch and goes over the top with his expressions. However, the supporting cast (with the exception of an irritating Jena Malone) that includes Donald Sutherland, Brenda Blethyn, Rosamund Pike and Tom Hollander perform very well. On the whole, I liked it most for the visuals and the supporting cast and appreciate it for being true to the books but it required a stronger lead pair. My favourite adaptation (albeit a very loose one) remains Sharon Maguire's 'Bridget Jones's Diary' (I haven't seen the BBC series yet).",,Anonymous,Romance
"Charming, but not the best version","First, I should probably make it clear I compare any P&P not only with the original Jane Austen book, but with the glorious and faithful 1995 Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version. This version has lots of plusses, but has major problems both on its own and in comparison. My main objection is the rushed feeling and the unnecessary deviations from the book. Even the six-hour miniseries had to cut some of Austen's dialogue, so it's not surprising that a two-hour movie had to cut much more dialogue and even some characters -- the Hursts have disappeared, as have Mariah Lucas, the Gardners' children, and others. Other than lack of faithfulness to the book, the missing characters are not a great loss, but the rush through one story element and to the next is unpleasant for the viewer. Why on earth did the director waste screen time on long shots of woods and parks that could have been used to add a little more story? The artiness of the dawn shots doesn't add anything to the movie. The clothes and hairstyles were also poorly done: gowns not very attractive or accurate for the period, hairstyles sloppy and falling-down. It could be that the production was trying for a grittier feeling, as the Gardners were both quite coarse and the exterior shots showed more of the underside of pleasant upper-class living, but I found it quite distracting. Even more distracting were the changes that served no discernible purpose. Why was the first sort-of love scene between Elizabeth and Darcy set in a rainy wood? Why the scene in the ribbon shop? What is gained by changing the scene at Pemberley from the grounds to the music room, or the scene between Lady Catherine and Elizabeth to the middle of the night, or the denouement to early morning in the fields? Many of the actors compounded the production's problems. Matthew Macfadyen's portrayal of Mr. Darcy makes him simpering rather than stately. (To be fair, one of the minor flaws of the 1995 version was that Colin Firth's Mr. Darcy was SO reserved that the viewer saw very little of his struggle against his interest in Elizabeth.) The able Donald Sutherland is horribly miscast as Mr. Bennet, and fails to present his humor or his weakness. As usual, Jane (Rosamund Pike) is not the stunning beauty that Austen describes, but I have yet to see an adaptation that uses a lovelier actress for Jane than the star, Elizabeth. Tom Hollander as Mr. Collins was pompous rather than silly. Judi Dench, of course, manifested stateliness as Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and Claudie Blakley was suitably unimpressive as Charlotte Lucas. I've liked Keira Knightly since 'Bend It Like Beckham' (qv), and she is luminous as Elizabeth.The biggest reason to see this version is, actually, its shortness. Many members of our MTV generation won't sit through a six-hour show, no matter how faithful or well-done. Anyone who has not read the book or watched the 1995 version will probably miss the defects and simply enjoy Austen's story. If it piques the viewer's curiosity enough to look for the book or a better version, everyone wins.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
a good try but better versions have been made,"I absolutely love the 1995 miniseries version with Colin Firth. I may have been biased by watching this version before the new version came out, but I think that the characters in this version were a bit too overacted. I think Lizzy in this movie (Kiera Knightly) needs a little bit more studying of the character, and the actor who played Darcy, could not even compare to the acting skills of Colin Firth. Overall, if you have not seen previous versions of this movie, you would probably love it, but if you want a great version of this movie, I whole heartedly recommend the 1995 miniseries version. Hope this helps you decide whether or not you will like the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Note for hetero guys seeing this ""Chick Flick""","I went to this film on a date and since she is a really nice and interesting person, I didn't want to disappoint. This is the classic Jane Austin ""Chick Flick"" but I have some good news for you. There are a few things to enjoy if you are a hetero-sexual male and not really into this type of historical knight-in-shining-armor story.First, Keira Knightly (Elizabeth Bennett) is unbelievably hot. I mean like out of control I just stared at her in every scene. She was a babe in ""Love Actually"" but here it's just right over the top. It was hard to actually keep track of the dialogue when she is on screen because I'm so focused on her. Second, Tom Hollander who plays the bumbling Mr. Collins is a genius. The guy reminds me of a sort of Victorian Adam Sandler trying to pick up women. And when Keira Knightly isn't on screen he steals the show and gets you through some slow parts. Third, there are some great outdoors scenes in England's Peak District where hills in the north of England really make me want to do some serious hiking. And my girl even agreed to do some camping with me since I was being so sensitive as to take her to Victorian romance. Fourth, did I mention how hot Keira Knightly is? So suck it up, buy some popcorn and Raisinettes and take your girl to the movies. She'll appreciate your sensitivity and the evening won't be a total loss.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
How to spoil a great novel...,"I cant speak English perfectly, so i hope you'll forgive me. Gosh...What to say about this movie? First, i have to say i've seen Pride & Prejudice directed by S. Langton with J.Ehle/C.Firth (BBC 1995, more than 360 mins) and i consider that film a masterpiece. Maybe i am a bit one sided when i speak about this new version of the film, but since for the very beginning of it i understood it would have been a poor thing: first of all, (as the most of the USA historical film) it is completely unfaithful: eg. in the first ball scene Lizzy asks Darcy if he wants to dance! Come on! Was Joe Wright out of his mind? A lady asks a gentleman to dance in the Victorian England period??! That's a nonsense as the most of the things shown in the movie. Second, what to say about the figure of Mr Collins? It should be a comic figure (as he was in Langton's film), but here looks more like a psycokiller. And Wickham? He is just the poor,gay, version of Orlando Bloom. What about Darcy and Bingley? the first one is really nothing in comparison with the great performance of Colin Firth and the second one is really ridiculous in the part of a weak gentleman. And Lizzy & Jane? They act like a '90 teenagers more than ancient English women. Too bad. Also Keira Knightley that usually acts good (a part to be one of he finest creature on the earth)in this film seems confused and acts hysterically in some part of it.

Keira Knightley has the gift to be , more you expect, Elisabeth. like Rosamund Pike, who does an admirable Jane. the flavor of novel. this is the gift of this honest, inspired and profound beautiful adaptation. but the motif to see it is, maybe, the feeling after its end. who seems be, maybe only in my case, like the old feeling after I finish the book.",,Anonymous,Romance

A good film,"As a person who is currently studying the Austen novel it was interesting to see how Pride and Prejudice was put into a full motion film. There have been several modern adaptations of this story, Bridget Jones I and II and the Bollywood version Bride and Prejudice. I thought this version was a very good attempt and don't understand why so many people are criticising it!!!!! I admit its not as good as the BBC drama starring Colin Firth (oooooooooo jumping into the lake!!) and Jennifer Ehle, but it is still good. The characters are well played (Judi Dench was good as the monstrous Catherine De Bough) and Keira Knightley wasn't that bad. I also thought Mary Bennet was better in this version. I thought the ""glossy"" British countryside settings gave the film that extra ""sparkle"". My favourite scene was when Elizabeth Bennet visits Pemberely. Even though it missed out several parts of the book it still stuck to the main plot. A 7/10 for me. Good",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""You have bewitched me... body and soul!""","I wish it were within my power to say something astounding regarding this wonderful new version of Pride & Prejudice, ""something that will amaze...and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb,"" as the enduring Ms. Austen had Lizzie say to the haughty Mr. Darcy. Alas, it is my poor fate to merely echo the sentiments of many others when I say that I was almost outraged to hear there was to be another version of this wonderful novel. How, when the pinnacle of perfection had been attained by the 1995 miniseries, could anyone hope, or dare, to attempt another. My outrage was further increased upon learning that Keira Knightley was to attempt the role of Ms. Elizabeth Bennett, the beloved heroine of this tale. I hold no dislike of Ms.Knightley, but she was far from my image of Lizzie, a lightweight, to me, in more ways than merely her slender frame. I was therefore not tempted to see it in the theater, for I feared it could be no more than ""barely tolerable,"" and, at worst, a desecration of one of the most beloved novels of all times.I was subsequently receiving little dribs and drabs from a variety of sources that, nay, this movie was quite good and enjoyable, even in the opinion of the reviewer to whom I turn most often for intelligence of this sort, the estimable Mr. Roger Ebert, who, though occasionally wrong in his facts, is seldom wrong in his criticism. Therefore, by the time the DVD was to be released, I had worked myself into a fair degree of anticipation and hope and, thus, made it my mission to obtain viewing rights upon the first opportunity.Gentle Reader, I cannot honestly say that my approbation was achieved upon the first viewing... for this telling seemed so dreadfully rushed as to be sometimes incoherent. I fear I might have been quite lost had I not been fortunate enough to have a thorough grounding in this story by the previous reading of the novel (at least thrice) and the enjoyment of the 1995 miniseries (at least twice), and even the former viewing of the 1940 execrable version, which one can only recommend for the pleasures of the wonderful Ms. Greer Garson (sadly, too old for the role), but completely ruined by someone's decision to turn the odious Lady Catherine de Bourgh into a matchmaker, all simpering approval of Lizzie's becoming her nephew's bride.Anyone who wants to talk about a movie version being abhorrent to Ms. Austen would have a challenge to find a more disturbing example of the misrepresentation of a major plot point.Ah, but there WAS something about this new and very youthful telling of the classic story, so I found that it must be seen again, and then a third time, followed by a feverish reading of almost all of the external reviews on IMDb, followed by a reading of many user reviews on IMDb, followed by a rereading of the novel, followed by a first time viewing of the 1980 BBC miniseries, followed by a reviewing of the 1995 classic miniseries.Was I obsessed with Pride and Prejudice? Gentle Reader, I confess that I was... and am. I was loathe to leave the story behind and only by all of these myriad contacts could I continue to live within the confines of this experience.I am, indeed, grateful for the many wonderful reviews that I read, that taught me to understand why, ultimately, this ""Pride and Prejudice"" was so compelling to me. At last, a version that touched my heart, where before it was only my mind that had been satisfied. Despite all the naysayers who compared it to a Boon & Mills romance (upon research, translated to the American: Harlequin Romance), who complained of its lack of historical accuracy (in some cases they were entirely justified criticisms), still I cannot deny that this version won me over with its fidelity to the spirit of Ms. Austen's intentions and that ultimately I found it to have ""bewitched me, body and soul.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Nutshell Review: Pride and Prejudice,"I'd say I must thank Heavens for bestowing upon me, a second chance to finally watch the most excellent Keira Knightley version of the timeless Jane Austen classic Pride and Prejudice.Most of you would already be acquainted with the rich story about the sweet romance amongst the wonderfully beautiful Bennet sisters, in age old England. But this movie, in my most humble opinion, tended to place focus on the love between Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) and Mr Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen), and between Jane Bennet (Bond girl Rosamund Pike) and Mr Bingley (Simon Woods), allowing us audiences to witness folk dances while they tease each other.And we also bear testament to the challenges of love in those days, where manners maketh a person, and prim and properness the order of the day. With gentle bows and curtsies, we learn of Elizabeth's rebellious streak to break all norms, and the lessons everyone can take home, in not judging a book by its cover.It makes you count your lucky stars (or do we?) about how we approach relationships these days, although some things, like the second guessings, and the waiting games we people play, seem to continue its stickiness like glue. Class and prestige make marriages like a business alliance more than that of love, and with age, makes some like a matter of convenience.Supported by an experienced veteran cast of Donald Sutherland and Judi Dench, the lovely Keira is up for a couple of awards for her role as Elizabeth, and I'd say, give them to her. Bravo! Her performance was most delightful, and brought to life a range of emotions that you cannot deny make this role hers. Matthew Macfadyen too holds his own opposite Ms Knightley, with his Mr Darcy so pompous, and yet so gentlemanly.Oh, I haven't read the classic (please pardon me on admitting to this most unforgivable sin), but for what it's worth as a movie, it's jolly good entertainment, coupled with a fair bit of eye candy. Though I did hope that the movie did have more time to explore in depth, some of its rushed subplots.(P.S.

Its just a shame that some people somewhere in the TV departments here in South Africa are often very ignorant of the genre of movies and very misinformed as they have classed this one as a 'Comedy'....can u believe it?! They need an education in the meaning and understanding of the different lives, morals and culture of these era's, as obviously they have no idea at all about this time period....very sad actually, as they have totally missed the lovely quirkiness and gentleness of those times.",,Anonymous,Romance

This film is excellent considering the fact that there were only two hours to fit everything in and yet the movie didn't fell rushed. The entire cast shined particularly Matthew Macfayden and Keira Knightley as the leads. MM lent a certain boyishness to Mr Darcy and was in a class of his own while Keira Knightley took the spirited , lively Elizabeth to the next level. Jena Malone and Brenda Blethyn were especially refreshing and a pleasure to watch. Rosamund Pike lived up to her name and certainly looked like a blooming rose as her Jane was very fresh and innocent.Director Joe Wright has done a marvelous job in bringing this amazing story to the big screen after the never to be forgotten A and E version.Of course it will be compared a lot to that one but I feel that both are special in their own unique way and should be watched with two completely different frames of mind.

Could have been so much better,"Well I guess in the UK we all know Colin Firth as Darcy and unfortunately Macfadyen is simply not good enough - I guess that's the theme of this movie - simply not good enough. There were a few things that really annoyed me, including the 21st century look to the Bennet sisters and the fact that Keira Knightley, looked to me as if she had the benefit of a professional make-up artist, which I don't believe ladies of the 19th century would have had. Having said this there were some nice scenes, I liked the dance scene and the wild scene on the edge of the peak district outcrop, but having been spoilt by such masters of the art as Peter Greenaway and Roman Polanski I became frustrated by the poor use of lighting, especially indoors and the failure to capture the real feeling of 19th century England that comes from Austen's book.I guess the reality is that I was expecting a lavish cinematic experience, and what I got was nothing more than a classy ""chick-flik""",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Everything is like a new live,"In fact, I have seen the movie a long time ago, and I don't know what is the number one watch today.

"A fascinating story, retold as good as it can be.","I preferred this version more than previous versions. Any of them have handled the story beautifully, but this latest version has several things going for it. First, Keira Knightley is somewhat better as Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew Macfadyen is a wonderful, brooding Darcy. Donald Sutherland gives a solid performance, but not quite as sarcastic as Benjamin Whitrow in the previous version as Mr. Bennet. I found Alison Steadman's Mrs. Bennet (previous version) too annoying, but Brenda Blethyn in this version is just right. The other sisters are a toss-up; the pluses and minuses average out. This new version has beautiful scenery. I thought some of the directorial decisions in presenting the thoughts of the characters was extremely well done. During the dance scene with Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, for example, they begin in the crowded ballroom (the place is really jammed!) and as they dance the camera comes to take in only Elizabeth and Darcy. If you weren't alert you might think they had slipped away, outside perhaps, and were dancing alone. Then we see the end of the dance and there they are, in the crowd. It startled me at the time, but it quickly penetrated what was being ""told"" in the story. Touches like this were scattered throughout the film, and I liked it. Joe Wright gets the credit for directing this beautiful film. If you loved the book or have seen any other screen version of it, be sure to see this one. It will stand out among all the others.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Fails to Capture the Intriguing Collision of Class,"11 March 2006. Unlike the mini-series version a decade earlier, this recent theatrical film version fails to present the more fun, gay, informality of the Bennett sister's and loses a lot of the authentic family interactions as well as the subtle non-verbal expression of proper etiquette that appeared so rigidly during this English era of the times. The richness of Jane Austen's dialogue and language has been picked bare in places while offering us the barest of the essential emotional high and low points, though the recent version does capture the emotional intensity effectively.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Austen lovers (and more particularly readers) BEWARE,"From the outset of the movie, I was hoping for something different from the BBC version, especially as it was the most recent version, and done very authentically with a wonderful realisation of Jane Austen's wit, humour and warmth. The main drawback with this production was that it was slightly sugar-coated visually, with nice warm lighting and generally a little clean. But nonetheless very authentic and true to the author, which is why many love the story so much in the first place. If you are one of these people, you will probably hate the Keira Knightley (let's-help-the-teeny-boppers-understand-great-literature) version.I like the more grimy setting of this film and thought (at least initially) that it demonstrated a desire to distinguish the film from other versions. One glaring question came from the first shot of Longbourne though, which was to do with the Bennet's manservant and other servants. How can a middle-class family of the late Eighteenth Century afford two servants and a manservant, especially when Mr Bennet himself appears to be working on the farm? Also, how is it that Mr and Mrs Bennet have such a cute relationship in this film, with Jane and Lizzie being so secretive from each other. Personally, I think Jane Austen is convulsing in her grave.For a horrible moment during the scene where Darcy prematurely proposes to Lizzy in Kent, I thought for terrible second that despite her rejection, they might just kiss anyway. I also thought that Lizzy might throw in a slap for good measure. Again, very poorly realised in the script. I also couldn't understand the creative team's propensity for taking some lines directly from the novel and then paring it with obviously dumbed-down lines for those who might have had the film confused with ""Bride and Prejudice"". Tricky Bs and Ps.(Enough with the pouting, Keira.)Poor, poor Wickham. Where was the man in this film who in the book meant so much to Lizzy (more than just a little crush) and helped her to learn so much about herself? About 4mins screen time.(Enough with the girlish giggling, Keira. 'Cute' isn't going to cut the mustard here.)Finally, (and mainly because I cannot bear to relive the horror of this movie much longer), did the people who wrote the script have any idea about etiquette in this era? Even if in a fit of passions, Catherine de Bourgh would never dream of invading a house in the middle of the night, unless she had recently become a highwayman. And Mr Darcy would hardly wander the fields near Longbourne at the break of day just for the opportunity to catch a glimpse of Lizzy in her nightdress. For those who just have to see it anyway, I won't spoil the incredible crassness of this moment.And can I just say, why does Keira Knightley have a modern hair-do sticking out from under her wig? Weren't they paying the hairdresser enough?Don't be fooled. Grimy (we're trying very hard to be authentic) presentation is just grime. And you will not be able to wipe it from your memory.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Absolutely wonderful!,"When I went to the cinema and saw 'Pride & Prejudice' I was a little unsure whether it would live up to my expectations and be as memorable and lovely as the book and the TV- series from '95. But as soon as the film began I was completely lost. It is very well made with talented actors who deliver a breathtaking performance.Keira Knightley is lovely as Elizabeth and Matthew McFayden is the Mr. Darcy of your dreams. I do not think I was the only one who sighed, giggled and wanted to be in Elizabeth's shoes more than anything throughout the night! If I should say anything not good about this movie is that it is a little rushed from time to time; famous lines from the book is swiftly said just to have it in there and one thing that I gravely lacked was the kiss between the two lovers (it's very annoying that the Americans can see it and we poor souls in Europe can not...) But even so, I dare say that 'Pride & Prejudice' is one of the best films I have even seen, and that is not just because I love the book. 'Pride & Prejudice' is most of all a romantic story and you laugh and cry while watching it, but it also teach you a good few things about life.I recommend it with all my heart to those who want to feel good for the rest of the week!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the Most Stunningly Beautiful Movies Ever,"The knock I heard about this film was that it was a ""woman's"" picture. Apparently that remark means that only women can appreciate incredible writing, striking cinematography and acting that can only be described as sexy through the chemistry that streaks off the screen. This is certainly not a ""man's"" picture because no one is killed or nothing is blown up. What ""Pride & Prejudice"" is is a thinking person's cinematic achievement which combines ""old-fashioned"" movie making skills with some well-chosen and subtle special effects. It's a movie that makes you feel what it was like to live in that era of more than 100 years ago. It's a film to savor for many years.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
when one can fall in love with a movie...,"I really feel deeply emotionally engaged in reviewing ""Pride and Prejudice"": I am such a Jane Austen addicted that my review is more a profession of faith than a proper review: let's admit I cannot be an impersonal and objective judge. However, no doubt that Jane Austen's most loved novel is brought to vivid life by Joe Wright's adaptation: a matter of fact, a very considerable and significant one, is that the director didn't fall into the temptation to turn the movie into a romantic hodgepodge, but, on the contrary, respected the intention and the mood of the novelist. Jane Austen's narrative didn't belong to the romantic age, both from a historical and from a conceptual point of view: what she provided was deep psychological insight into her characters, along with careful social analysis. She could be considered a sort of modern psychologist, one of those counsellors of today, who answer questions in today's magazines. The movie, focused on Elizabeth's relation to Darcy, proves total adherence to the novel. The heroine is a self-conscious, intelligent girl, who, despite her young age, knows perfectly the complex, and not only charming nature of love. Love is not only a matter of honeyed words, and languishing eyes: love is a very serious matter demanding trust, honesty, communion of mind and soul and only when unresolved and tricky questions are sorted out, is she able to accept and to give love. What the movie doesn't lack, and which is to be found widely in the novel, too, is that subtle and witty irony, pervading dialogues and situations. Period detail is impeccable, costumes and locations are a pure delight for the eye. The final result is truly enjoyable, funny, thoughtful and extraordinarily able to attract a modern audience, both of women and men: I was able to persuade my father, who is an old-fashioned man fond of western and action movies and really allergic to costume-movies, to see and even appreciate it. I admit I was once able to see it twice: I just never get bored, it seems I can never get enough. I truly loved and still love this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pride & Prejudice  2005 Joe Wright,"I saw it yesterday on cable TV, and I am disappointed: this version is not an adaptation of the book, it is something supposed to be P & P.The cinematography and the music score are great and I enjoyed both immensely.But I have not liked at all the changes made to the book that were absolutely not necessary, like the scene when Darcy proposes to Elizabeth for the first time : why was it shot under the rain in the outside? And they looked like they were going to kiss... Was that really necessary, or when Elizabeth, with her Uncle and Aunt, visits Pemberley House, they visit a display of Greek statues but in the book all they see are miniatures and quite acollestion of them, she hears the piano and she peeps through the door to watch Georgiana playing, this is unheard of as decent behavior at any time, especially at that time, the same for the famous Lady De Bourg visit at Longbourne : in the middle of the night ? Even the pompous vicious and haughty Lady would not stoop down to such demeanor.Transforming Longbourne into a farm with animals and fowls, etc, and in general the dreary house, bad furniture, rather dirty place: there is no mention whatsoever of anything of the sort in the novel; or all this linen on the lines, there all the time, never taken down even when it rains, it is strange because it does not belong to the novel and does not add anything so important to the plot it had to be added.Mr. Bennet was a gentleman and as such had the estate of an esquire, he spent most of his time in his library reading, some time walking his dogs, shooting etc. but not gardening !!!! and certainly not in one bed with his wife, whom he could not stand and made nasty jokes behind her back, even at her face. The shot of Elizabeth on the swing, with muddy bare feet, I do not know why they did this; it is not in the book. Neither this invention of a Mr. Hill.A PLAY may lend itself to interpretations and some changes, since there are no clear-cut limits imposed by the author. But regarding P&P the author has written in the NOVEL exactly all he or she, she in this example, wants to see and all she needs in order to bring her ideas to the mind of the readers, this is why I tend to be very demanding of the directors to respect the text of the authors : they cannot do what they jolly well please !!!As for the characters, Elizabeth is OK, so is Darcy, his cousin Fitzwilliam, Jane and Bingley, Georgiana and the other Bennet sisters. However, Mrs. Bennet has not enough fits, Mr. Bennet chuckles much too much, Wickham does not look pervert enough, Lady De Bourg is not vicious enough  Judy Dench is a bit too soft , and Miss De Bourg does not look sick enough, Mr Collins is doing just fine and Charlotte is OK. Overall, it is not bad if you forget it is supposed to be based on Jane Austen superb novel, but if you are like me a dedicated fan, you cannot help yourself and will always compare it with the brilliant BBC series, which is top (only the costumes did no look right to me).It is a pity this version was mishandled.",,Anonymous,Romance
Beauty and Boredom,"Pride and Prejudice isn't a bad film by any means. The thing is, I don't think it deserves all the praise it's been getting since its release in November.Pride and Prejudice is based on Jane Austen's most famous novel, and is mainly about the love/hate relationship between poor girl Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) and rich man Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfayden). The story is set in Georgian England. As far as I'm concerned, this is at least the 4th of 5th film based on the novel. There was even a Bollywood musical adaptation released in 2004. So, was director Joe Wright and co. able to bring something new to the table?Overall, I'd say yes. First things first, the film is extremely beautiful to look at. Whether it's the fields, the small houses, or the large ballrooms, they all look amazing. Wright shined in the ball scenes. Despite the huge number of people, he handled it very well. His camera (or scanner, I must say) moved smoothly from one character to another, and he rarely cut. And not to mention, the dances were well choreographed. I also really liked the score; it was very heartwarming and very fitting.The acting was very good too. Knightley gave a great performance, and her Oscar nomination was well-deserved. Just look at her eyes during Mr. Darcy's first proposal. You could really feel her pain and vulnerability. Macfayden was good, and Judi Dench was great as Catherine de Bourg, although I felt she was criminally underused (2 scenes in the whole film).And unfortunately, that's where the good news ends. The film makers had to fit a 4-hour story into a 2-hour film, so a lot of stuff had to be chopped. As a result, all the secondary characters almost had no screen time. For example, Mr. Wickham gets only 2 scenes, and Mary Bennett gets about 10 lines. So, whenever Elizabeth and/or Darcy were not on screen, I was bored to death, because frankly, I couldn't care less about the other characters in the film. They were as bland as it gets.Another thing I hated was all the ""stalking"" scenes. In several scenes of the film, we see Darcy in the background, quietly staring at Elizabeth. Yeah, I know his pride and shyness prevented him from talking to her, but for some reason, I felt these scenes belong to a horror movie or something. One scene in particular had me laughing (unintentionally of course); When Elizabeth bumps into someone (we couldn't see who he is), and then the camera moves up to show us Darcy's face, looking down on her, I thought he was going to grab a knife and cut her throat or something. That scene was during the ""hate"" part of their relationship, so it would have made sense, heh.So, I'd recommend watching Pride and Prejudice, but I'd suggest lowering your expectations. Or even better, I'd suggest seeing other Working Title films like Love Actually, and Bridget Jones' Diary, and I think you'll have a better time. I know I did.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better then the book. MUCH better. Way better then the miniseries too.,"I especially like that they cast Mrs Bennet as a real person, with reasonable concerns. Imagine being in her place, knowing you and your daughters will be penniless as soon as your husband dies, knowing that men usually die younger then women! I never understood why simply pretending to be above such matters was deemed the right response. Here the show gives her credit for worrying, and trying to be as proactive as she can, even if she wasn't actually helping that much. It also shows the better side of Lizzie's parents relationship. Its a marriage. Its not perfect but considering the number of kids, its not a cold marriage either!Personally looked up the matter of the sleeveless dress; In 1800 short cap sleeved dresses for evening were around. They might have been more cosmopolitan, but they definitely existed. Go look for yourselves. As for some of the more old fashioned dresses at the ball, well you would expect that too. So, before you go off about Caroline's dress, look up evening dress 1800. You will see very similar styles.Kiera also manages to make Lizzie more likable. I may be wrong, but Lizzie in the book, and in the miniseries, is just a bit mean. She mocks poor Mr Collins, and the book mock him too. All because he is grateful, earnest, and short. I didn't like that. I like it much better in this version, where you get the feeling that maybe Mr Collins actually married the very best woman in the whole story.As for Asten's humor, I think this version has as much as necessary. Dont forget, her humor is basically just mocking people and customs. If you had an overwhelming amount of it in a 2 hour movie, the effect would be rather unpleasant. I dont see how it could be better.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good movie if you don't know the 1995 BBC mini-series,"When this movie came into the theaters, I was profoundly pleased with the performance of the lead actors (Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen) and the director alike. I would have voted 8 or 9, then. Compared with food, this was a fine dinner for two with an agreeable wine.Well, years later, i.e. last week, I happened to watch the BBC mini-series from 1995, and alas, I must say: I was overwhelmed by that piece of art, by its richness in detail, its pure perfection. You get an aperitif, a delicious soup, a four-course meal, each course accompanied by an other exquisite wine, then a plate with a dozen cheeses, finally concluded by tiramisu, cappuccino and a cognac.Just to make sure that I was not delusional, I read one third of Jane Austen's novel (it's in the public domain so you can legally download it from the Internet). It's nothing short of magic how the BBC version managed to translate the full ""Pride and Prejudice"" into pictures. This magic is not possible in Hollywood-compatible two hours.Each version has its legitimacy. It's up to you to decide which kind of dinner you are planning to have.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"If you're after some Austen action, you've gone to the wrong movie...","Alright, before I begin, let me establish - whilst I am both an Austen fan and a fan of the 1995 BBC Mini-Series, I am not a purist. I walked in to this film with very few expectations, and willing to accept that it would not be like the oh-so-wonderful BBC version. I was ready for a change. And I have to say, I pretty much got what I expected - just let me remind you, that wasn't a whole lot.Firstly, this film is NOT Jane Austen's version of Pride & Prejudice - it's more like an odd, re-written version of P&P by Emily Bronte. Instead of the novel's original clever, witty and fairly quiet suburban, drawing room satire, director Joe Wright chose to create a lush, sweeping, romantic saga, set against stark and gloriously beautiful locations.Essentially, the story is pared down to its bare roots -- Lizzie Bennett, a precocious and rather giggly girl, meets and hates-on-first-sight Mr Darcy, the uptight and taciturn friend of Mr Bingly, the new renter of Netherfield Park. Bingly, goofy, awkward and tongue-tied, is immediately enchanted by, and falls in love with, shy Jane Bennett, Lizzie's older, quieter sister. The story follows Lizzie as she first hates and then falls in love with the increasingly emotionally fragile Darcy, overcoming her prejudice towards him, and assisting Jane in establishing a relationship (and marriage) with Bingly.Sadly, many wonderful (and, in my opinion, extremely necessary) characters fall to the wayside - the clever caricatures of Mr Collins (the obtuse, silly, mean spirited cousin), Mrs Bennett (now just a tad whiny but mostly lovable), Mr Bennett (indulgent rather than scathing), and Lady Catherine (still nasty and selfish, but lacking any of Austen's delicious wit) all dwindle down to not-much-ness. It's Austen, Jim, but not as we know it!This film DOES have some good points - firstly, the cinematography, is just plain gorgeous. This is top class stuff - one film moment, where Lizzie stands on a mountain precipice whilst the camera sweeps around her, really made me catch my breath. Also, Matthew MacFadyen brings a very interesting new dimension to the character of Darcy - while we miss out on Darcy's clever dialogue and scathing wit, we do gain a lot of vulnerability that is interesting and really beautifully portrayed by MacFadyen. While I still think that Colin Firth has created a version of Darcy that is, in my opinion, unbeatable, MacFadyen really engaged me and had me interested.Keira Knightly, on the other hand, was NOT my vision of Lizzie. Whilst she is much closer in age to the character than Jennifer Ehle (""not yet one and twenty""), she turned an outspoken, intelligent, strong, independent character in to one seriously lacking in backbone. She wavers back and forth from giggles to looking teary and forlorn -- all in all, not a character that I can imagine ANY man of intelligence falling desperately in love with.I have to admit, I also found the overall change from early 19th century English Regency to late 18th century French Provincial (???) really irritating and confusing. As I understand it, the director was interested in setting the film when it was originally written (which was, admittedly, at the end of the 18th century), but what he failed to take in to account was that Jane Austen did major rewrites of all of her novels before they were published in the 19th century. However, whilst the setting would not, in my opinion, have been at all appropriate to a more faithful portrayal of the novel, the execution of the story was so different from Austen's original intentions, it hardly matters.All in all, tossing aside my love of the novel, I still find I am left with a fairly mediocre film. There are some glaring historical inaccuracies (or rather, historical improprieties - such as a certain character wandering the countryside in her slippers and nightgown, to name one), the costumes are ill fitting and really unflattering for ALL of the characters (I understand the director wanted to ""ugly up"" Knightly, although I don't understand his reasoning for this - Lizzie is, after all, supposed to be very handsome) and the dialogue for the most part is uncomfortably, awkwardly changed from the original. I suspect, as well, that if I didn't know what the story was about, I wouldn't have been able to follow this film very easily.To sum up, go see it if you know the story and want a new take, or don't have a clue what the story is about - you'll probably at least moderately enjoy it (and clearly, many people have). However, if you are a major fan of the book (or just like it a lot!) stick to the BBC series - Jennifer and Colin leave this version for dead.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

I've also seen the 1995 BBC version.In fact, I had just finished re-reading P&P directly before seeing this movie for the first time (back when it came out) and I was impressed that a 2 hour movie could do justice to the novel and really incorporate all the important scenes. They did have to cut a few corners, but not much (Wickham is not fleshed out enough - but he isn't in the 6 hour BBC version either). A truly remarkable achievement.The acting is good and the cinematography gorgeous.

Pride & Prejudice Does Filmmakers Proud,"Pride & Prejudice Let me state right up front that I've never read Jane Austen's classic, Pride and Prejudice (you can chalk that up to the shortcomings of a public school education if you like, but more realistically should blame the fact that such books aren't really to my taste). That, in turn, might make you wonder why I went to see Pride and Prejudice in the first place. The answer, at least in part, is that I really enjoy a well done period piece (I have as much a thing for costuming and authentic sets as I do for special effects). But I'd also heard good things about the acting and the film in general, and figured it was worth the matinée price to check it out for myself.Pride and Prejudice takes place in Georgian England where ladies and gentlemen alike endured certain expectations of them from society at large. Deviations were, at best, frowned upon and could even result in the ruin of reputations and families alike. The Bennett family is no exception to these stringent if unspoken rules. With five daughters, Mr. Bennett (Donald Sutherland) has his work cut out for him. His wife, Mrs. Bennett (Brenda Blethyn), has that work well in hand as she schemes incessantly to get her five girls safely married, preferably to wealthy men.Though lacking in wealth themselves, the Bennett family is viewed well enough in society to enjoy invitations to parties thrown by others in their rural community. So when the rich and good looking Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods) has a ball, the Bennett daughters are among those present. Mr. Bingley and his astringent sister, Caroline (Kelly Reilly) are also playing host to Bingley's best friend, the dour Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen). Though the eldest Bennett daughter, the beautiful Jane (Rosamund Pike) finds Mr. Bingley much to her liking, the independent Elizabeth Bennett (Keira Knightley) feels just the opposite about Mr. Darcy.With misunderstandings of intentions and feelings cropping up on all sides, Jane tries to hide her emotions while Elizabeth's are all too evident. Matters are only made more complicated when the staid and stiff Mr. Collins (Tom Hollander) shows up for a visit to the Bennett estate he's named to inherit. Mrs. Bennett is delighted when Mr. Collins expresses some interest in one of her daughters becoming his wife, believing the family will be safe from being turned out if he's married to one of them. But handsome British leftenant Mr. Wickham (Rupert Friend) and Elizabeth's good friend, Charlotte (Claudie Blakley) may have a thing or two to say about that!Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy's upper crust aunt, the Lady Catherine de Bourg (Dame Judi Dench) has some marriage plans of her own. But decisions by Mr. Collins, actions by Mr. Darcy, and the inexplicable by one of the Bennett daughters throw virtually everybody's plans and desires into a complicated and potentially catastrophic state. And poor Elizabeth finds herself in the very center of the storm.Keira Knightly is a very pretty girl and not a bad actress, but her tendency to have what my mother always called ""mush mouth"" makes her hard to understand at times. Rosamund Pike and Jena Malone (as the irrepressible Lydia Bennett) have no such difficulties, while Brenda Blethyn is a tour de force in her role as the nervous Mrs. Bennett. Tom Hollander has Mr. Collins' disapproving looks down pat, while Simon Woods and Rupert Friend are both perfect for their roles. Matthew MacFadyen is all right, too, though I might wish Donald Sutherland troubled himself to have at least some semblance of an English accent.In Pride and Prejudice, though the acting is all fine or better, perhaps the most enjoyable element is provided instead by a story that should be antiquated, but somehow isn't. Kudos to the screenwriter who provided this latest screen adaptation to include the proper atmosphere even while including drama and humor that were perfectly understandable and appreciable by modern audiences. As I'd hoped, the costumes and the sets were just fabulous. There were also a few really creative edits and some very good direction to round the picture out. The cinematography, too, is spectacular.Pride and Prejudice is a really enjoyable movie on a number of levels, though I suspect it will be most successful as a date movie or a so-called ""chick flick."" In a way, that's too bad. It's honestly better than that. In fact, it's better than a lot of other movies have been this year. I sincerely hope it's broadly appreciated by audiences who will be in for a real treat when they take their seats for Pride and Prejudice.FAMILY SUITABILITY: Pride and Prejudice is rated PG for ""some mild thematic elements."" Although tales of Georgian England are sufficiently ""clean"" to satisfy even the most strict of parents, the language and plot is complex enough that I'd leave the under-12 crowd with tickets to Zathura instead. I also have to admit that teenaged boys aren't much going to care for Pride and Prejudice. For everyone else, though, I recommend Pride and Prejudice without reservation. It's fun; it's funny; it's beautifully filmed; and it's just plain good.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Glorious, Beautiful, Simply Wonderful Film","After last year's abysmal Bride and Prejudice, I halted, uncertain on the threshold of this film, the period retelling of Jane Austen's classic novel, nervous of a similar experience beginning to show itself, but I took the plunge. Within a short space of time my fears had vanished, and had turned into feelings of joy and ecstatic wonder at the beauty of this film.The film has almost breathtaking beauty. It is beautifully shot by Roman Osin who uses glorious countryside and wonderfully colour in the exteriors and captures the sumptuous design in the interiors. And what design! It is a wonderful period piece with ornate and beautiful things to behold, all of which are held within the bracket of authenticity.Credit must also be given to three others: Joe Wright for a stunning feature length directorial debut, Deborah Moggach for a superb adaptation of a novel that is sacred to millions and Dario Marianelli for his glorious subtle and splendid score. But above all, the thing that stands above all others is the superb ensemble.Keira Knightley is brilliant as Elizabeth Bennet, providing the first really great performance of a career that will, no doubt, be glittering. Matthew MacFadyen is also good as the, initially, proud and miserable Mr. Darcy, whilst Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland are fantastic as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, although Sutherland's accent is occasionally questionable. The rest of the cast is brilliant with a star turn from Tom Hollander as Mr. Collins.It is simply the best British film of the year so far and is set to be embraced by thousands young and old.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Well directed, well acted and poetic...I like these types of films but this just wasn't really for me","I haven't read the novel but I have read the comic adaptation of this and enjoyed it. Which was the main reason I decided to check this 2005 version out. This was a well directed movie and although I didn't read the novel it seemed like a pretty good adaptation. I didn't like all the choices for the cast in this movie, but for the most part it was superb. The music in this gives off the mood during certain scenes and for the most part I liked the melodic, calm and soothing music in this. Another positive aspect is how the dialogue gives off the poetic vibe like the comic. The cinematography sometimes has a very risky approach of going from one part of the story to another without any cuts which was cool. And because it's difficult to pull off. It's pretty obvious why this story was so remarkable for it's time, even today it stands out. Although the cinematography is vivid the movie seemed to skip around a lot, it just seemed a lot of the parts from the novel is missing so the movie just didn't seem all that well developed and connected. I was never really a big fan of Keira Knightley but she was just right for this role and not just when it came to her looks either. What really stood out to me was the subtle dynamics of this film, that I think captures the novel well. The thing is though is that although I like movies that take place during this similar time period but the movie just didn't capture my attention that well although it got slightly engrossing at times. I sometimes review movies from just my point of view and this movie just wasn't able to grab my attention although there were some music and scenes that stood out to me although few. This is a character driven movie and it captures a lot of character elements with passion. For a movie that is 2 hours it seems to be missing a lot from the novel, but it still captures the essence of the novel. There will be some people that will really love this movie but for me it just wasn't all that great to me. It's a good movie but just wasn't great.7.2/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A complete scandal,"After seeing the BBC miniseries version of this, I am completely taken back by this version, and not in a good way. They jumped from storyline to storyline, added too much drama, strayed from the book too much and even COPIED the BBC miniseries version! they copied it in ways such as: the nether field ball - Mary is supposed to be so accomplished, not bad at singing at all. the BBC miniseries version added that part in for interest, and then this current version COPIED that, which wasn't in the book at all. Also, a lot of the wording wasn't taken from the original book, but just the previous TV version. They crammed everything into too short a space of time and got the architecture all wrong. they skipped characters out (such as Mr and Mrs Hurst and the Gardiner's' children) and added humor into the story where the book did not indicate it. This is a minor detail, but I couldn't believe it when i saw it: Caroline actually wore NO SLEEVES only thin straps! i have researched the era of Jane Austen thoroughly and i can tell you that they NEVER did that. NEVER. it would be seen as so rude. i thought the acting woeful. Keira knightly copied Jennifer Ehle thoroughly and was hopeless. the Mr Darcy in it was arrogant, but not proud at all, which was his main problem! everyone rushed through their lines and were so plastic that i could be sick. i give the makers credit, they did contain feeling. but it was the WRONG feeling. EVERYTHING was DRAMATISED.overall, the whole thing was hopeless. it was such an insult to the immortal Jane Austen's writing and i shall always remember the makers of the movie and the actors in the movie, ESPECIALLY KEIRA KNIGHTLY WHO WAS TERRIBLE with the utmost anger for ruining this completely harmless, sophisticated and magical story and turning it into a SHAM. I do not recommend ANYONE to watch it. it was woeful.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mesmerising and Beautiful,"Having never seen the BBC 1995 Mini-TV Series I went to see Pride & Prejudice with open eyes, not sure what to expect and wondering whether Matthew MacFayden could pull off the great Mr. Darcy.The opening of the film was a little disappointing, and it takes awhile for the dialogue, and the flow of the film to get going, but once it's started the film takes your breath away. Some of the camera-work and the shots are at times questionable, I'm sure Joe Wright's intent was to have the characters faces completely obscured by sunlight, but it doesn't really work. The locations are stunning however, and the film looks beautifulKeira Knightley puts in a fantastic performance, and Matthew MacFayden really comes into his own in the last half hour of the film, as he reveals the ""real"" Mr. Darcy.I'm going have to go and see the film again once it's on General Release again, I'm not sure how easy it'll be to stomach it the second time around.Overall, 8 out of 10 though!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Excellent adaptation, better than earlier versions!","Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this version of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. In particular I found the central performance by Keira Knightly carried the film, along with splendid support from Brenda Blethyn, the other Bennett sisters and some of the minor characters such as Tom Hollander's Mr Collins. The cinematography is ravishing and the music underscores the atmosphere very effectively. Maggoch has adapted the novel effectively, focusing it more strongly on Lizzie, with the male characters more to the background - just as in the novel. The principal casualty of this is Wickham, who is relegated to pretty boy louse with but a few lines. Inevitably comparisons will be made with the 1940 Garson/Olivier version, and the 1995 BBC TV mini-series - and this film, stands up very well compared to these - in fact, I'd argue its the best of the three. The 1940 version is principally interesting for the changes an American studio made to make the film interesting to its audience - the carriage race between the Bennetts and the Lucas family - the invitation with 'please bring this invitation with you', the Bennetts packing up to leave town after Lydia's disgrace, the choice of a Victorian setting, which the 34 year old star thought would more flatter her figure, the archery contest and the turning of Lady Catherine de Bourgh into a sympathetic character at the insistence of the actress, Edna May Oliver, playing her. The BBC version's tone was set by the opening titles - ravishing needlework, and glossy handsome locations, and heroines with improbable décolletage. Visually there is a big difference compared to the BBC version - here the Bennetts live in the country, mud and all, in the BBC version it was sanitised for its American co-producer's audience (dirty finger nails were not allowed). The other big difference between the BBC and this version is that in the former, given more time, adaptor Davies 'opened out' the story to show us more of Darcy - in the film Maggoch does not, arguably being 'truer' to the novel, for those who worry about such things. Both Ehle and Knightly make creditable Elizabeth's - Knightly possibly more 'girlie' and Ehle more 'knowing' - both excellent in different ways. On the secondary parts the film is stronger, with Blethyn avoiding the Dickensian caricature Steadman fell into in Mrs Bennett, similarly Tom Hollander's Mr Collins avoided the grotesque of his BBC precursor, David Bamber. Finally, Darcy - given the adaptor's focus on Lizzie I think MacFadyen does the lingering glances and aloofness hiding shyness as well could be done. Its difficult following in the footsteps of Colin Frith's wet shirt...but I think MacFadyen succeeds. In summary, a very successful adaptation, thoroughly enjoyable - and my favourite of the three.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A very cinematic adaptation, definitely worth a look","I don't know what's with all those harsh comments. The standards applied here seem a bit unfair. Perhaps this is not an adaptation true to the letters of Jane Austen, but it captures an essential part of the story and unfolds it on the big screen in such a lusciously visual way. In the BBC adaptation, Mr. Darcy had all the extra scenes that explain his inner struggles and following transformations, but Mr. Darcy in this film is entirely colored by Lizzy's subjective perception. So that's why we feel a little bit blocked out from his point of view. However, Matthew Macfadyen is a very subtle and nuanced actor and gives much more than is required or allowed, for that matter. Seen from Lizzy's point of view, this story feels much more intimate and personal. I think the makers and the cast emphasized aspects of the story that are different from the BBC version. Although I'm a huge fan of '95 version and Colin Firth, I had no problem with this adaptation. To be fair, at least this film is much, much better than most films hit the theaters near you these days.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mr Darcy is amazing!,I just spent 2 great hours in the cinema. It was packed and rightly so. This is a great film. It is of course very romantic but also really funny and the adapted screen play is made really well so that all scenes flow together easily. Its an old fashioned film made for modern times. I really did not think that anyone else but Colin Firth could play the part of Mr Darcy but Matthew MacFadyan's performance completely blew me away. I am almost inclined to suggest that he plays the part better. I also thought the rest of the cast were fantastic. I enjoyed the film from start to finish and although I knew the story I was completely gripped and gutted when it finished. GO WATCH IT>>,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A beautiful film, but not Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice","****** this comment may contain spoilers *******Trailing in the wake  albeit 10 years later  of the superb BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, the 2005 film directed by Joe Wright is a lively two hours. Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen are brilliant up and coming actors who deliver fine performances in the roles of Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy  considering the script they have to work with.Quite naturally, a film has time constraint and isn't going to convey the story as powerfully as did the book or the much longer mini-series that so faithfully encapsulated Jane Austen's classic tale of true love threatened to be thwarted by those two evils, pride and prejudice. However, the recent film's screenplay focuses on the two main characters - and not all that successfully  and its lack of veracity to Austen's novel leads to further disappointments concerning vital secondary characters and settings.The parts of the cynical and careless, though likable, Mr Bennet and his awful, neurotic wife; the obsequious Mr Collins; the haughty Lady Catherine de Bourg; the flighty and hopelessly shallow Lydia; whilst well-acted, (apart from Donald Sutherland's atrocious ""English"" accent) fail to be the characters of Austen's book. And what happened to the amiable and all too malleable Mr Bingly, who behaved like a grinning simpleton having a ""bad hair"" day for the duration of the film? As for the scurrilous Wickham, his brief appearance on screen seems hardly enough to develop sufficient interest in the character to vaguely care if Darcy has swindled him out of his rightful inheritance, or to ultimately sense disgust that he is a contemptible scoundrel.All in all, if one overlooks the lack of faithfulness to the book in the film - where Jane Austen's country gentry are portrayed as bucolic yokels, where an enormously endowed pig wanders through the dilapidated kitchen of what is supposed to be Austen's gracious Longbourn, where her genteel Mr Bennet plays ""Farmer"" - Joe Wright's take on the literary classic is beautifully filmed with settings and costumes that are a delight to the eye.That's all very well and, if the film was not the retelling of a famous piece of literature, artistic expression could reign free. However, it is impossible to view a film titled ""Pride and Prejudice"" and not expect Jane Austen's characters to come alive on the screen; to see her settings believably depicted.Ultimately, two hours of watching this latest rendition of Pride and Prejudice buys one little more than the bare bones of the classic story; disordered skeletal remains, at that. Therefore, the film fails to engage the sympathies; fails to enmesh one in the lives of characters of such literary magnitude that they deserve our notice and concern, for in Joe Wright's film they do not exist as Austen portrayed them. Without the natural response of regret for each of her characters' foibles and disappointments, there is no ultimate sharing in Austen's majestic victory of love for another over love of ego.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Completely Worth Watching!,"This movie is a genius! It is so romantic and the scenes are filmed so well thanks to Joe Wrights work!This movie is so likable because the characters all have their own personalities. Mr. Darcy is very a very strong character, he is played very well and you will fall in love with him,just like I did! Lizzie Bennet is played very well by Keira Knightly, she has her own beliefs and you will like her for that.Overall, this film is a must see. It has the ability to make you cry which most modern day movie cannot. It is also much more realistic than the T.V version. I would highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This movie has corrupt conversations that don't work,"The conversations between characters seemed super fake, forced, and there was just no emotion. Especially between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are like this. Their conversations with each other are spacious and don't flow like a normal conversation would. Plus they are super awkward toward each other and seemingly don't know how to speak to each other. It isn't just Darcy and Lizzy though Bingley, the Bennet's, and Collins all seemingly have no clue how to have a normal conversation. They may be terrible at speaking to each other, but they have very good facial expressions throughout the whole movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simply Beautiful,"Joe Wright's 2005 movie representation of Jane Austen's classic ""Pride and Prejudice"" was impeccable – it cannot be criticized negatively. This movie was perfect. I have to say at the outset that I have seen this movie a handful of times, and every time I see it I am totally stress-free and calm. You cannot watch this movie and be stressed out. Rarely does a movie director get it right when trying to present a movie representation of a great literary work. Joe Wright gets it right, no pun intended. The actors chosen for each part were phenomenal. Speaking of characters, I appreciated the fact that the husband does show some affection towards Mrs. Bennett at different points in the movie – an improvement, if that is not too sacrilegious to say, on the way Austen portrays the husbands attitude towards his wife in the book as having chosen poorly and having to live with the consequences – literally. Knightly and MacFadyen do an exquisite job in their leading roles. The dynamics between the Bennetts and the interplay of dialogue, or at some points banter, are quite convincing and just downright fun. This movie is a romance in the most wonderful sense of the word. Sure, normal people do not have amazing soundtracks playing when they are happy, contemplative, or upset, – and it was an amazing soundtrack- and normal life does not always end perfectly; but sometimes there are moments or even days when life with all of its joy and sorrow is a beautiful experience. Wright reminds us of this.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Alright then!,"While being ultimately meaningless, a movie of very low importance, and an ultimately boring two hours and nine minutes, Pride and Prejudice (2005), unlike other blockbuster romance/drama movies (for example, Titanic or Twilight), had actual, unsophisticated romance in it.

Austen turned into trash,"I couldn't agree with the one star crowd more. This simply doesn't compare with the BBC series. Jane Austen's spirit is not present, the thing is witless and illustrative. Even worse, it's conceived in an eye-poking populist manner. The proper costumes of the classicist period were swapped for a mishmash of later styles for a 'better' look, and the story itself was relieved of Austen's social observations, and warped into something imponderous like a daytime soap. It's Lizzie's new version that this weightlessness is most evident in: she's all attitude and no personality. And no discipline either: she giggles downright stupidly all the time, like a spoiled brat long overdue for a punch in the nose. Watching this atrocity, I couldn't help thinking of the 'creative' team of braindeads behind it. How much they must have been struggling to make every aspect and detail 'consumable', i.e. dumb. I'm afraid they have fully achieved their goals with this mess devoid of competence, style and respect.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Amazing, I wish I would have seen it in the theater","I must say Pride & Prejudice is not a movie I would set out to see. I have seen the 1995 version and thought it to be alright. By chance I happened upon 2005 version the other day and I am now obsessed. The scenes were amazing, acting was perfection. Mr. Darcy, how perfect is Matthew MacFadyen. Not sure about Mr. Darcy at the beginning of the movie but madly in love with him by the end, just like Lizzy. And Keira Knightly, well what can be said about Keira besides perfection in every way.The first time I saw it I was very intrigued and had to watch it several more times. Each time it got better and better as I was catching certain things I missed. It gets better every time, I suggest anyone see it at least 3 times.Without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of all time",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A stylish and funny romance.,"Before this film, I had never seen a Jane Austen adaptation, or even read any of her books. The closest I'd ever come was when I saw Bridget Jones's Diary, which is practically a modern version of Pride & Prejudice. Then I finally got to see the new P&P, and it was much better than I expected. The ending was a bit predictable, since I had watched the previously mentioned Bridget's Diary (but frankly, aren't all romantic comedies a little predictable?), but that didn't matter, because Pride & Prejudice is a remarkable, astounding picture.Set in 1797, the film chronicles the life of the Bennet family, whose ""matriarch"" (Brenda Blethyn) is very eager to make sure her daughters get married as soon as possible. Actually, to define her ""eager"" is a huge understatement. Anyway, the focus is on two Bennet sisters in particular: Jane (Rosamund Pike) and Elizabeth (Keira Knightley). The former is attracted to Mr Bingley, a slightly funny-looking, but nice man, whereas Lizzie has to deal with the silly Mr Collins (Tom Hollander, in a small but amusing role), and, most of all, the cold, ambiguous Mr Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen). She can't stand him, and he doesn't seem very enthusiastic about her either, their like/don't like relationship being the core of the movie.The film's greatness lies in the fact that first-time director Joe Wright makes an ""old school"" romance look fresh and interesting. The way men courted and proposed to women may seem a bit dated, but it's so true and utterly believable, it makes you wish all rom-coms were this good. Silence is as important as words, and locations and weather also have a crucial part in the matters of the heart (rarely has rain looked so romantic).What also impressed me is of course Knightley: it's her best performance to date, as she makes Lizzie Bennet one of the most convincing characters to have ever appeared in a period piece (her Oscar-nom was slightly unexpected, but fully deserved). Macfadyen is absolutely perfect as Darcy, a complex role brought to life with top class elegance and style. But it's the older thespians who deserve more attention: Blethyn's Mrs Bennet is just a little OTT, while Judi Dench's presence is as memorable as her equally brief, yet flawless, appearance in Shakespeare In Love. The standout, however, is Donald Sutherland as the only male member of the Bennets. He's on screen for quite short time, but thanks to the right lines and attitude in the right moment, he's totally impeccable. Should have received a Best Supporting Actor nomination, in my opinion.Overall, Pride & Prejudice is an incredibly pleasant experience. Watch it, and you will understand why, after several adaptations, Jane Austen's classic still conquers audiences everywhere.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very very good,"I thought this was excellent. It was very well cast and well shot, the script was a good if brief adaptation of the novel, and although I was dubious before seeing it, as what else can you really do with the story now, I was happily surprised and I would definitely see it again.The whole story was just as exciting and romantic as it should have been, and the sweeping views of British stately homes and countryside were also very cool.Everyone was really good, we spent most of the film trying to figure out where we'd seen the actress who plays Lydia before, and it turned out to be in 'Stepmom'.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I do declare this movie to be most adequate,"I first watched Pride & Prejudice upon it's release back in (2005) having not read the original novel by Jane Austen I had nothing to compare it to at the time so my initial thoughts were purely based on the movie. I didn't really enjoy the movie the first time I saw it as again I had no knowledge of it's story, characters and being a teenager at the time I wasn't really interested in romance movies but was happy to watch them with my then girlfriend. The most positive thing I could say about the movie at that time was that it sparked my interest in reading the novel it's based upon as I do remember thinking that the story and social commentary of the time period was something that interested me making want to learn more about it from the original book.I read the book a few years later and I can honestly say that it has become a personal favourite of mine so much so that I purchased a collectors first edition print of the book that is now displayed proudly on my bookshelf at home. I personally found the book to be so much better than any of the plays or movie adaptations of this classic love story including this one.I recently took a second viewing of this movie to see if it was worthy of all the praise it received by fans and critics upon it's initial release. I personally would say that ignorance is bliss and that the younger version of me who was bored by this movie was actually lucky to see it without any knowledge of the original books contents as anyone who has actually read the book and studied classic English literature will find this movie interpretation to be historically inaccurate and rushed with characters that differ from the classic characters portrayed in the book.I'm not saying that this is a bad movie because on the contrary it's actually quite well done especially considering it was released in (2005) when there was an overabundance of romance films being released at that time most of which were cheesy romantic comedy's. The problem with this movie however is that it fails to capture the thought provoking social commentary of the time era, instead focusing more on the Bennet sisters giggling at every man with two legs and a penny in his pocket who happens to walk bye. The first half of the movie feels so rushed and fails to properly introduce our main characters if you hadn't already read the book you would have no idea who is who and with most of the woman dressed so similarly in white gowns with fair brown hair you lose track of which Bennet is which. The story does become much more focused on the romance between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy in the second half of the movie but we still don't learn very much about them as separate individuals as most of the screen time is focused on Elizabeth's blank expressionless face as she broods over Mr Darcy.The acting is very good from everyone involved you can definitely see that every actor and actress involved is giving it their all even the extras do a great job. (Keira Knightley) does a great job playing Elizabeth she was definitely a good choice for the role sadly the on screen chemistry between her and (Mathew Mcfadyen) Mr Darcy isn't very believable but as separate characters they both play their parts very well. The only character I didn't like was Mr Bingley who in this interpretation has absolutely no grace or admirable qualities about him whatsoever and instead just comes across as a simple minded idiot who couldn't manage to tie his own shoes without Mr Darcy there to help him let alone propose to Jane. I don't blame the actor who portrayed Mr Bingley though I believe he was simply playing the character the way he was asked to play him.Overall while this certainly isn't the best interpretation of this classic story I still recommend giving this movie a watch it has it's moments that make it an enjoyable romance movie to watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Movie,"This version is simply marvelous. You can't compare it to a miniseries (that's unfair), nor necessarily to the book. The acting is superb (including the two leads), the photography is wonderful, the screenplay is brilliant, and the tracking shots are amazing. I laughed and was very moved. Although the dialogue was hard to understand at first, this is the best English language movie I've seen so far this year, and I see many movies, including most of the major American independent movies. Joe Nichols, the director, deserves lots of kudos for his work here. If there is any justice, this version will pick up some significant Oscar nominations.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another fine movie made from an Austen classic.,"Pride & Prejudice is a more than adequate adaptation of Jane Austen's perhaps most famous book. It marries her classic writing with an excellent cast, great sets, and beautiful cinematography.For me, the movie begins and ends with Keira Knightley. If she wasn't in it, I doubt I ever would have been compelled to watch it. But knowing how good of an actress she is and how she excels in period movies like this, I was happy to give it a shot. And she was wonderful, as usual. It's hard to imagine a better modern actress to portray Elizabeth Bennett. She was, of course, supported on all sides by fine performances from Donald Sutherland, Rosmaund Pike, Judi Dench, and several others. But it was undoubtedly Knightley's show, and there was nary a hitch to be seen.The other standout element in Pride & Prejudice is the dialogue. This is no surprise, as the script was lifted directly from Austen's lauded prose. Good writing made the novel a favorite for over 200 years, and it makes this movie a success, as well.I can't imagine anyone who has enjoyed the book thinking that this is anything other than a fine adaptation, all around.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Superb adaptation,"As someone who's read the book and seen the 1995 BBC adaptation (and enjoyed both), I was very impressed with Joe Wright's take on Austen's famous novel. Director and cast do a fine job of making this 18th century tale seem fresh and modern - the acting is first-rate from both leads, the atmosphere is engaging, the touches of humour just right.There are some real moments of magic here - the arguing in the rain, and the dance where everyone but Knightley and MacFadyen disappear from view spring to mind. Yes, it's overly sentimental in places, and the time constraints mean that not all the characters are fully fleshed out, but these are minor quibbles. Above all, it reminds you what true love really feels like, and by the end you'll want to swap places with either Darcy or Lizzie (unless perhaps you already do own half of Derbyshire). A finely crafted piece of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not as good as the one with Colin Firth,"Pride and Prejudice happens to be one of my favorite books, and it's also one of my favorite movies...just not this particular version. It was enjoyable, and Kiera Knightley gives a wonderful performance. I think she is my favorite Elizabeth Bennett, but Colin Firth will remain my favorite Mr. Darcy, even though this one was good as well and also extremely handsome. One of the problems I had was that if felt a bit rushed. If you've never read the book or seen the other version you probably won't notice, you may even think it to be too long. Either way, if you loved this movie or weren't quite satisfied, I urge you to see the 1995 version. Then again, if you thought this movie was way too long, do NOT see the other because it is twice as long.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
i am mortified,"Allow me to preface by saying that before viewing this version of Pride and Prejudice I carried very high standards due to my love of the novel as well as the spectacular BBC mini series. Nevertheless, I could not help but be mortified at this effort of butchering a classic. Other than the cringe-worthy portrayal of Mr. Darcy by Matthew MacFadyan, the acting was actually commendable. The actors were simply victims of a script that had an incredibly fast pace and had the nerve to alter the phrasing of Austen for a 21st century audience. I was disappointed on every occasion as I awaited one of the novel's unforgettable lines. The relationship between Mr and Mrs Bennet was also a total mystery, as the lay viewer would assume they had an amiable relationship when in truth Austen portrayed them as being largely estranged. Probably my biggest disappointment was the mangling of epic scenes such as Darcy's initial proposal to Elizabeth and Lady Catherine's confrontation of Elizabeth, both of which could have been pivotal in the movie's success. For those of you who enjoyed this film, I beg you to watch the 1995 mini-series and in turn give this monstrous effort the contempt it deserves.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

We were utterly prepared to dislike this new version (talk about prejudice...). And we both came out raving. Given the limitations inherent in a 2 hour running time, I find it hard to imagine a more enticing, entrancing way of bringing P&P to the screen. Authenticity is no option in such a time span - if you want close adherence to the book, stick with the series. The movie is not nearly as meticulously researched and takes ample liberties with the sense of propriety and etiquette that governed Austen's genteel circles. In fact, the approach taken in the film is contrasted to the TV-series in almost every aspect, but this has it own rewards. Whereas the series sticks to an authentically early 19th century idiom, and the intimate and provincial feel that is pure Austen, the movie inserts modern day phrases and emotions in Austen's text, and is altogether more worldly, cosmopolitan even. The people are more beautiful by our standards, even though I'm sure the BBC Lizzy and Jane are far closer to the type of woman that would have been considered very beautiful in Austen's days (just look at portraits from that time period). In the series the Bennet's are a seriously dysfunctional family with an aloof father and a hysterical mother, but with a sense of standing intact (as they are in the book); in the film they are a scruffy, chaotic, but lovable and, actually, loving bunch. Brenda Blethyn tones down Mrs. Bennet's madness to a level where she becomes a believable and even sympathetic character. It is not what Austen wanted her to be - her disgust of the character is obvious throughout the book. But it makes for a more involving movie experience. Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennet is a pleasant surprise, too, even though the make up department might have made some effort to disguise the fact that he has a very good dental plan. Keira Knightley is an excellent Lizzy. Feisty, effervescent, and melancholy in turn, she gets you involved in the character right away. Nor does Matthew MacFadyen need to fear the competition from Colin Firth. He is as dark, brooding and intriguing a Darcy as you could wish for, and his sudden emotional outpouring when he first confesses his love (set amidst the wide rainy vistas of Rosings (in fact, Stourhead) park rather than in the intimacy of Hunsford parsonage) is totally gripping. The movie very much pivots on these two characters, and the achievements of these two actors ensure that the essence of the story is there, completely. Where you loose, inevitably, is in the minor roles. Tom Hollander is, again, a more humanly believable Mr. Collins than we got in the series, but he is also somewhat flat, and does not erase memories of David Bamber's bizarre, yet peculiarly endearing rendition (and, again, Austen meant for Collins to be a comic caricature). Lydia and Wickham are reduced to devices needed to unfold the plot, and even Judi Dench as Lady Catherine is relegated to such a position. Her final confrontation with Lizzy was to me the most disappointing scene from the movie, and is no match for the power Barbara Leigh-Hunt brought to this scene, that ought to feel climactic. (An aristocratic lady of those days, by the way, would never have had such a tan...). All this is more than compensated for by gorgeous imagery. Locations, costumes, crowd scenes, landscapes: they are all stunning. The two balls in the first half of the movie are way more festive, inviting and crowded than the understated formal occasions they are in the series - raucous, too; though again, the series is probably closer to the kind of atmosphere in which people like the Bennet's and the Lucasses would have moved. Burghley as Rosings and Chatsworth and Wilton as Pemberley are way over the top, of course - no matter how grand Mr Darcy and Lady Catherine may look from the Meryton perspective, they most certainly do not belong to the circles of high aristocracy that would in actual fact have lived in houses of that size and splendor. Again, the series is more authentic; but what a feast for the eye these locations offer in the movie! In the end comparing this to the 1995 remake is as pointless as the endless discussions between proponents of period performance in classical music versus those preferring big orchestral versions of Mozart and Beethoven with modern instruments. For Beethoven as Beethoven knew it, you need the former; but the latter can offer no less, and sometimes even more musically and emotionally rewarding experiences. Both are valid in their own way, and we have the luxury of not having to choose, but being able to enjoy both. All in all, and judged on its own merits as a movie, this P&P is wonderful, and very much worthwhile to go and see!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent for a two-hour adaptation,"Being a great fan of the mid '90s BBC TV production of P&P (the one with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle), and having read the novel, I was a bit apprehensive about seeing this movie.But I think it succeeded. The dialog was less faithful to Miss Austen than was that of the 90s TV production, but some of the longer sentences wouldn't have worked in a screen adaptation. Still, one of the short but key sentences from the original (and the BBC production) was missing in this movie: Lizzie, on seeing the great grounds of Pemberly (Mr Darcy's estate), and having adamantly refused his previous arrogant marriage offer, had perhaps ruefully said: ""And of all of this I could have been mistress.""I thought the cinematography and art direction was brilliant. The direction less so (too many lingering shots of Lizzie being moody).",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Bewitched, Body and Soul!","For a year this DVD was sitting idly on the shelf as I had not come around to watch it. For someone who has fast forwarded through the book and has not been able to sit through the '95 mini series, this didn't seem so tempting.But I have to say that brevity and taste in adaptation of the book for the sake of a movie has played a strong role in making it appealing to the impatient audience of the 21st century. Furthermore, acting and selection of the characters has outdone anything that I could have had in mind. Beautiful cinematography suited for a hate/love story, marvelous sets and costumes, also great editing has made it even more rewarding. It also boasts a great score and I can't help but say that this movie did bewitch me body and soul... to the degree of watching it three times already in the past few days. I never thought that one day I'd be obsessed with Pride & Prejudice. Amazing!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
LOVELY in every sense of the word!,"Having just come from the theater, I must say that I am still enchanted by this beautiful film! This is the reason I go to the movies----to see accomplished actors playing interesting characters in authentic settings with fine direction and editing! I have seen probably all the previous incarnations of P & P---all were special in their own ways. This version is extraordinarily well done! The casting of major characters----Keira Knightley, Matthew MacFadyen, Brenda Blethyn, Judi Dench---is brilliant! Keira and Matthew were everything I hoped for from Austen's novel! Special nod to photographers who captured the countryside and the sunrises and sunsets so beautifully!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Truly delightful and enjoyable,"Pride and prejudice is a well know story that follows the 5 sisters of the Bennet's foray into relationships and marriage. The backdrop of the story is set in England of the late 18th century. An age where marriage pervaded more socially and financially than ones own choosing. This is even more evident in the Bennet's since their house will fall out of their hands if Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland) dies. Hence why making a good marriage is of utmost importance. So we get to met quite a few eligible bachelors. Ranging from the tad shy Mr. Bingley to the proud and stout Mr. Darcy and the very inept Mr. Collins. The scenery and locations lends itself to your eyes and really enhances the love story by being truly visual amazing. And talking about a pleasure for the eye, Keira Knightley really shines in this movie. She has received Golden Globes nomination for best actress for this role and it's well deserved. Her performance is scintillating and she really fits the part as Elizabeth. Donald Sutherland is awesome and does his best part in a long time. Matthew MacFadyen (Mr.Darcy) provides both regal-ship and vulnerability to his character and really portrays him well. His chemistry with Keira is also quite good (unlike Keira and Adrien Brody in The Jacket) The rest of the cast is also magnificent. My only wish is that it should have been a bit longer so the elaborations of the relationships could really unfold. Jane Austen fans would surely miss some scenes. So I hope there will be a longer directors cut when it arrives on DVD. All in all a very enjoyable adaption and one that should not be missed.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best Romantic Movie I've Ever Seen,"I've always loved the book and even the Lawrence Olivier version (anything with Lord Olivier). I have a copy of the BBC version and I enjoy it, although I always thought the men in it were better cast than any of the women. I only wished the 2005 version was longer and am hoping desperately for a Director's Cut. This was as I had always envisioned Pride and Prejudice, with all the youth, vigor, and real people. I loved them all. The movie itself is just beautiful, layered to show so much going on that you must see it again and again. And every time you find something new to appreciate. I can't say enough, but I recommend it to all.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A stunning adaptation,"I did not think the BBC's 2005 serialization could be surpassed but it turns out I was wrong! This is a superlative adaptation - surely one of the best movies of its type to have come out in recent years. The acting is uniformly brilliant. Matthew MacFayden and Keira Knightley, in the lead roles, both show dimensions I hadn't thought they possessed, and the supporting cast is a veritable galaxy of top talent: Judi Dench a splendidly haughty Lady Catherine, Donald Sutherland a pleasingly shambolic, kindly, wise Mr Bennet; Brenda Blethyn agonisingly vulgar as his wife; Kelly Reily really excellent as the arrogant Caroline Bingley; and a lovely cameo from Tom Hollander as the ghastly Mr Collins. Above all, though, Miss Knightley makes an intelligent and luminous Lizzie, and fully deserved her Oscar nomination. Elsewhere, Deborah Mogach's screenplay manages to preserve and convey as much of the book's greatness, in the time allotted, as is possible; Joe Knightley's direction is faultless; the cinematography breathtaking - a tribute to the beauty and charm of England's countryside and architecture. There is a shot of Miss Knightley atop a rock in Derbyshire that made me catch my breath. I have watched this movie three times, and each time, as D'Arcy strode towards Lizzie through the mist at the end, the tears streamed down my face! A must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pride and Prejudice on SPEED....,"...2hrs. 9 minutes to tell a 10 to 16 hour hard read of a book? I think Joe Wright did a find job. I did feel like I had been on a bit of a roller-coaster ride of emotions but a mighty fine roller-coaster with beautiful well-crafted views. Was it a Knightley film feast... yeah you bet...but if I had to pick a leading lady to stare at for 2 hrs. she would be in my top ten list. I hope this film wins some award for photograph. I don't believe I have seen close-ups done that well in color ever before.MacFadyen was a fine high speed Darcy, there was not time for him to be the quiet struck up Firth Darcy. In the time allowed I think he did very well... or maybe quite well as the case may be.Supporting crew, yeah, well, OK. But really who cares as long as Lizzy and Darcy get it right. I must give my highest marks to Judi Dench who WAS Lady Catherine as far as I am concerned.Maybe if I had the time and education I would join the Jane Austenites, who have been decrying the shabbiness of Bennett farm and household but hey the little visual tour of England and the walk through some of the finer old homes more than made up for the pig in courtyard shot that has caused such a fuss.To the end now... I loved the book (more than once) loved the BBC series (both a few time each) and I loved this movie. All are different in their way but all tell the wonderful story of two very interesting, very complex characters who are pushed and pulled to and fro by the strongest forms of Pride and Prejudice.So unstuff your shirt, sit up straight, made shure you lap bar is secure and enjoy a fun whirl on this rapid-fire performance. If you want the Jane Asten dialogue read the book, if you have not seen the BCC series get ye to a library and check them out... all good and worth the time. As is this movie.At your service. . .

A personal view of a belated discovery,I just want to pass on my congratulations and immense thanks to the cast and crew and executives responsible for this version or interpretation of Pride & Prejudice.I sincerely believe it is quite possibly one of the best films ever made.Jane Austen herself would be proud of what this team has done with her work and if that is humanly possible has even improved on it. Joe Wright can walk tall with the likes of Visconti. And KK is just divine.Thank you.Quite simply wonderful film making.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pride and Prejudice light,"I agree in part with other critics from this site, yes the dress was slightly wrong, yes the language was too modern at times, it didn't have the feeling of authenticity that the BBC drama had but I cant say I didn't enjoy it. I have read the book, am no expert on the period or literature but it felt that this movie put too greater class divide between Bennets and the Darcys/Bingleys. Perhaps this was caused by the unshaven appearance of Donald Sutherland, however it didn't overly upset me. The direction lead to a couple of silly scenes that were pointless and took time away from the plot. Some of the actors' didn't appear to have understood the roles they were playing, for me Lizzy giggled too much. Having said this I enjoyed it very much, and for anyone else who did, and hasn't yet experienced the TV drama and the book, I recommend they watch/read them. I thought Keira Knightly (for all her giggling) looked gorgeous in it, and Matthew Macfadyen as Darcy wasn't too bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Like a long walk with a good friend,"I've read this book at least 20 times. So, it's saying a lot when a movie adaptation of the book can get me to cry ... sigh ... laugh or just feel contented at all the same places along the story line. The staging was beautiful though a bit heavy handed yet it's Hollywood. What do you expect? The costuming was very true to form. And, oh the romance. It's like snuggling in your favorite blanket in front of the fire. Though no movie adaptation of this book could ever be as good as the A&E version this one runs a very close second. Ah, and then there is the surprise actor/actress. You will just want to cheer when you see him/her walk into the frame for the first time. Well worth going to see it just for that.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Strong writing, direction and the acting of Keira Knightly make this a marvelous retelling of the Jane Austen story.","This was an exhilarating movie to watch. Much of the credit goes to very intelligent direction, including fluid tracking shots and long takes that put viewers in the action (a ball sequence early in the film was especially effective). A concise script keeps the story moving in a compelling way. The single greatest source of exhilaration, however, was the performance of Keira Knightley, who brings one of the most attractive heroines in English literature, Elizabeth Bennet, incandescently to life. Knightley captures Lizzie's intelligence, wit, fierce pride and passionate nature perfectly and gives the most mesmerizing performance by an actress that I have seen in some time. This is the story of a woman who is acutely conscious of the limitations placed on women by the age in which she lives and who is very skeptical in her view of men, yet who is also capable of profound passion. Knightley and the others involved in bringing this most recent version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" to the screen make watching Elizabeth Bennet's fate unfold intensely interesting and pleasurable.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A stunning film, even if you only read the book in school.","I was fortunate enough to attend a gala screening of this film at the British Film Festival here in Israel tonight. I don't generally watch period films of this kind and I thought it would be interesting to try something different for a change, Keira Knighley's presence notwithstanding of course! I have heard many disgruntled fans of Jane Austen's book complain that this film did not do it justice or that it didn't measure up to the 1995 mini series with Colin Firth. If so, I suggest you either read the book again or watch the mini series again because when something is made into a film, it is what it is, otherwise you get the blandness of what was the first Harry Potter. A direct translation. The film is to be shortened and altered to fit whatever vision the writer or director may have, otherwise it is simply what has gone before and what would be the point?Anyway, to the film. I must admit, though I was familiar with the story, modern times have caused me to look at it differently now, drawing more comparisons with Bridget Jones than it's former incarnations or it's source text. I apologise if that seems sacrilegious. However, as a non fan of this genre, I was pleasantly surprised. The visuals are beautifully artistic, the acting superb (and these lines are not easy to give over as naturally and convincingly as they are here) and the script is sharp. I was drawn yet again into this story, which has never looked so rich in my opinion and despite a few scenes that could have been trimmed down for meandering a little, it moved at an acceptable pace. Knightley embodies pure Jane Austen strength while keeping it believable for the period, giving a solid performance and a few Americans turn up with nicely polished accents to add a little spice to the cast. Donald Sutherland for example, in a gentle turn as Mr. Bennett and Jena Malone from Donnie Darko as Lydia. The always wonderful Judi Dench (Lady Catherine) turns up giving us one of the most powerful dialogue scenes of the film, is the icing on the cake. Rosamunde Pike is beautiful and she underplays her character, without bursting into over the top fits of tears and whining as would have been possible. Having said that, she still has too little to do.Of course, Matthew Macfadyen is not Colin Firth and I'm sure he apologises to everyone for committing this hideous crime, however, he does play Mr Darcy and not Colin Firth, so I assume he can be forgiven. Tom Hollander (I know him as Daniel of Martha, Meet Frank, Daniel and Lawrence) is toe curlingly ""ridiculous"" as Elizabeth puts it, in his role as Mr. Collins.I shouldn't think English Lit students would do necessarily well to ditch the book in favour of the film, but I do think this film is a good representation of it's source material and deserves credit where credit is due.

Swing and a miss,"If you have not seen the original b+w version or the masterpiece that is the BBC mini-series you may very well enjoy this latest attempt to make Pride and Prejudice. Though exited to see this well received movie, upon watching I found myself very disappointed as I found the movie to be hap-hazard and sophomoric. There were many good actors through out and I fault none of them as the acting can only go as far as the director is willing or able to take it. This director seemed barely to understand the material or the time and place for which the tail is set. For my money, this movie was a dreadful mistake that only wets the appetite for the quality of storytelling that Austin's masterful and rich tale deserves. If one were to focus on this movies most obvious and glaring flaw it would be its abandonment of the roll of manners that colored every aspect of late 18th Century interaction and conversation. Such breeches of ethics and good manners such as getting caught ease dropping (a sophomoric 'joke' used several times in this film) would have devastated all involved. If you want to see what I mean, see the above mentioned mini-series for all the examples you could ever need.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Like Darcy: a rough-edged movie to love forever,"First things first. Keira Knightly is brilliant. She is in almost every scene, not always at the center of the scene, sometimes as part of a crowd, but she lights up every scene she is in. She is beautiful and winning, and in-turn fun-loving, sarcastic, giggly, confrontational, concerned -a virtuoso performance. The character of Elizabeth is a role to die for, and Knightly knows it - but she steps up to it and becomes the definitive Elizabeth for a generation of movie-goers.The Bennett family comes across as a real family - the interactions between the daughters is rarely the focus of the action, but its always present and creates a believable context for the story.And the movie is beautiful -from its rural scenes to its manors to its landscapes, it lavishly, almost indulgently, shows a place and a time.And the camera-work! Watch as the action at a party proceeds without any cuts - the camera backs out of a room follows other action, enters another room. Its not only breath-taking (was anyone else reminded of Hitchcock and Rope?) but it pulls the audience into the scenes, shows the physical size and layouts of the rooms, and the relational frenzy of the party.But the bottom line for me was that this Pride and Prejudice has great emotional power -while maintaining all the various plot threads of the book. I loved it. Loved it. Loved it. (And I'm a guy!)Rough edges. Yes, there were some. At the end of the movie Elizabeth uses the phrase ""Incandescently in love"" - in an age before electric lights, I doubt this word was well-known or used in this way. And several scenes struck me as wrong: the dance at the stately ball was too crowded and low-class. But these are nits. This movie is like Fitzwilliams Darcy - its beautiful at its core and worth loving forever.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Breathtaking film,"In the 2005 edition of this timeless tale of hate and love, Keira Knightley shines. She portrays Elizabeth Bennet with the right amount of balance, giving some and taking some in each scene. She was well deserving of her Oscar nomination. It is by far her best performance. Other characters, such as Dame Judi Dench in her subtly cruel role as Lady Catherine de Bourg and the cute Jena Malone as melodramatic, hopeless romantic Lydia Bennet also pull off their parts well. I can't bash any of the acting in this movie.I was in bed with pneumonia when I first saw it, therefore I got a little lost in between plot and language, but I rented it again. Right then and there, it shot up to, if not close to, my top ten favorite movies list. It is a must see for everyone, whether you are a fan of romance or not. You will be completely immersed in its beauty as well as the sharp and crisp language.I know there has been some heated IMDb debate about what version of Pride and Prejudice is best. I have not seen the older versions, so I cannot speak from that standpoint. But please, if you are wary about renting it because it may not compare to your favorite P&P, don't listen to your conscience. It is totally worth the 2 hrs, 5 min spent watching.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Overall very agreeable.,"As a Jane Austen fan since high school lit class, and a great fan of the BBC 6-hour production, I was not inclined to see yet another P&P production. I was more than agreeably surprised. The changes made to accommodate the two-hour screenplay were in keeping with the overall feel of Austen's writings. I feel this adaptation more nearly represents the class division between the Bennett family and the esteemed rank of Darcy and Bingley. I had also been somewhat uneasy about the BBC production as to Jennifer Ehle's age, vis a vis Elizabeth. She was perfect in execution of lines and to some degree the spirit of the character as portrayed in the book. However, her performance was easily eclipsed by the fresh and girlish Keira Knightley. She absolutely glowed. Stealing the movie was Matthew MacFadyen as the aloof but smitten Darcy. WOW! His performance is bound to bring moviegoers back to this movie for second and third viewing. Any Jane Austen fan will immediately mark this Darcy as the best of any who has attempted this character. I did lament the loss of more character development for Wickham and Mr. Collins but this is a small price to pay for the breathtaking locations, sets and performances of the principle characters. After two viewings I am looking forward to going again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
disappointing !!,"I has a lot of high hopes and expectations before watching this. At the end I was quite disappointed.I cannot understand why it had won so many awards and nominations. I have read the book and seen the TV serials by Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth many many times and fell in love with them. Maybe I expected too much.To me, in order to fully appreciate 'Pride and Prejudice', it must be thoroughly read and watched. It cannot and should not be simplified into a movie. This is none other than a remake of the 1940 movie by Greer Garson and Lawrance Olivier. Simplicfication and deletion of some of the actual scenes and events simply did not work.Keira Knightley acted well but she was no match with the lovely and attractive Jennifer Ehle.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
I really enjoyed this movie...,"I think the movie ""pride and Prejudice"" was a great movie. I could tell that the actors and actresses were carefully selected to match each character, and I think they each did a good job to fulfill their role. My favorite actress in this movie would have to be Keira Knightley, she really brought the whole movie together, in my opinion. Another thing that I really think turned out very well is the setting of the story. It looked very authentic, and the story takes place in a lot of different places. For example her house is almost exactly how I would have a pictured a house in the eighteen hundreds as well as with the outside scenery. My favorite parts of the movie , what I thought made this movie completely unique, was how it was filmed. When I watched the part where Mr.Darcey purposed to Elizabeth, it was raining and thundering and the weather was very intense just like their argument was. So I thought that was a really good way to grab everyone's attention. I thought that the dialog for the story was good however, some things they were saying it was a little hard for me to understand- either what the words meant or what they were saying. The music during the movie was wonderful too, and I really enjoyed it especially the scene where Elizabeth is sitting on the swing spinning. It is raining outside, and the music is playing that really made me feel for Elizabeth. The movie got really intense this point. In this story there is a lot of misunderstandings and problems between the characters which got me hooked into the story. The part when Lidia runs away and marries Mr.Whitcomb, and Mr.Darcey ends up paying for the wedding so Lidia and her family didn't look bad really shocked me. That he would do that and especially not wanting anyone to know.I knew at by that point in the movie he wasn't as a bad as a guy as Elizabeth thought he was. As for the movie ""Pride and Prejudice"" I would definitely recommend this movie to someone who is looking for a romance. Jane Austen is a terrific author and this is one of her most well known novels of all time. Her story aided by Joe Wright's directing.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Shallow characterizations, so-so acting, but visually sumptuous","What an over-rated film!!!! no wonder HBO is underplaying it; they're barely showing it! the always-terrific Brenda Blethyn saved the day for me; she stole every scene she was in. For those who have not read the books, and/or seen earlier versions, i suppose this was a thrill. but so much character development was lost in the service of showing off Keira K., whose range as an actress is quite limited, that it did a great disservice to Jane Austen.It came off as the ""lite"" version...so very much of the delicious nuance lost in translation...Lady Catherine de Beauve (now Buck????). Wickham not fleshed out. Lady Caroline Bingham (Frieda Inescort has no competition) was a total CIPHER, no bite, no real bitchiness nor hauteur. Collins, although seemingly a fool, was much better served by other actors, altho' there was something endearing about this portrayal.It greatly bothered me that other important supporting characters--Mary and Kitty, Darcy's sister, were relegated to non-roles, a few moments, at best.BUT, the WORST OFFENSES i will reserve for: 1: this MacFayden fellow, lol, absolutely no match for Sir Olivier nor Colin Firth and, 2: by having Darcy profess his love one hour into a 2-hr. film, ALL dramatic tension was LOST. Dumb, dumb, dumb. Stupid, even.I guess it's the Cliff Notes film version, for a generation with no patience.One positive note: i did appreciate the attention to detail...that the Bennets lived among cows and swine, the preoccupation with ribbons -- these are important details missing other times.PLUS: Elizabeth's visit to Darcy's sculpture hall --- that scene, plus the elk herd-- were moments of genius, imho.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pride & Prejudice = Masterful & Stunning,"I have to admit that, personally, watching a film that takes place in a time so distant from a time I can relate to is sometimes so daunting a task for me. This isn't to say that I am in any way moronic or ill-educated. It's just that, occasionally, filmmakers don't do an adequate job with translating these classic novels into the film format.Having said that, I want to tell you what a truly wonderful viewing experience this film was. From the fade in on, I was completely enveloped in this film, it's setting, and characters. The indication that lets you know you are watching a truly exceptional film is that you become part of the story, or the story becomes part of you, and you are not there as merely an observer anymore. There were moments in the film where I had to look down in order to make sure I wasn't dressed in tails.The setting was truly marvelous. The director made excellent use of the English countryside. There is one scene in particular that stands out as having brought tears to my eyes. It's towards the end with Kiera Knightly standing on what I can only assume is a very small cliff. It's a wide shot, but it almost looks like a painting. It was beautiful!Most of the actors turned in splendid performances! Donald Sutherland was an appropriate choice to add that touch of subtle humor. Judi Dench can always be counted on for that perfect brand of matriarchal superiority. Matthew Macfayden, who's work I'd never seen, gave a great performance in the role of Darcy, conveying with ease that his character had many facets behind his highly-polished, yet aloof exterior. The supporting cast was wonderful, too, and it's so refreshing to see an actress such as Jena Malone in a supporting role like this. I've been a fan of hers since ""Stepmom"". If she plays her cards right, this film could be her catalyst into more adult roles. Last, but, by no means, least, Kiera Knightley shines in this film! The only other film I've seen her in was ""The Jacket"", but this film really made me appreciate her more as an actress because, in that film, all I could think of was how much she resembled Winona Ryder, and how it would be interesting to seem them play sisters in something. While I loved ""The Jacket"", it's my opinion that that film kind of almost muted Kiera Knightley's abilities as an actress. What I realized from this film is that she is extremely proficient at knowing just how to deliver her lines, and also conveys emotion well through her facial expressions. It's hard to not focus solely on her in a scene because she unintentionally steals any scene that she's in. Kiera Knightley has been offically added to the growing list of actresses that have earned my total respect and appreciation. I can't wait to go through her filmography to experience more of this fine actress, and I can't wait to see what she does next.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
It was pretty good.,"The production details, like Longbourne's decor for example, were outstandingly good. In the scenes with the Bennet family at home, brilliant technical work produced a sense of actually being there, chasing the sisters around the house. I was reminded of Taylor and Burton's 'Taming of the Shrew', because of the decor and the actors' vivacity. A couple of weaknesses let the side down a bit for me though: the clichéd shots of people in the rain, with heavy-handed symbolism, and some pretty modern lapses of vernacular speech, especially Lizzies' interrogative ""What are you doing here?"", demanded of none other than Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy. This had me thinking that the script-writers may have been hijacked, by cute actresses, into giving the dialogues a more 'modern' feel. Miss Knightly did a very good job, although she injected a large dose of self-indulgence, albeit unconsciously, into Lizzies manner. The actor playing Mr Bingly, outrageous hair aside, was every bit the doting companion, whilst Mathew McFayden presented rather a washed out Darcy, who seemed in need of a strong coffee most of the time.Darcy, then, was disappointing. Instead of smouldering, he appeared to merely smoke: the dark turbulent depths to his character simply didn't expose themselves. Where was the arrogance?Finally, Britain's sharp class divide failed to register against a background of frivolity and teen romance. This divide is what Pride and Prejudice is all about, after all, and so the resulting recipe lacked the piquancy of a genuinely 19th century dish. The girls' hopes for the two men are thus merely teen loves, not the despairing passions, impossible to be requited, that Jane Austin penned.All the same, a pretty good film.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Definitely disappointing,"This film looked great - the director has obviously gone for 'realism' so slightly dirty houses and clothes etc and it didn't look chocolate boxy at all which was nice. Equally, the filming was lovely in the sense of colours (really earthy and actually very English). The costumes were a bit odd however - using clothes from a slightly earlier era was fine I think... except that Caroline Bingley's bizarre mix of regency / 2005 Versace stuck out like a sore thumb.The cast was OK and the film generally acted quite well. Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennet was fantastic - she absolutely stole the show. Judi Dench was Judi Dench. Jena Malone as Lydia was really quite good, deliciously immature and snotty, but there wasn't enough of her - the wonderfully comic but uncomfortable sub-plot which is the Lydia/Wickham story has been completely mangled. Keira Knightly was OK with the right sort of wickedness and energy - she'd clearly watched some tapes of Jennifer Ehle do Elizabeth however! Donald Sutherland didn't really get Mr Bennet I don't think - there was something too American about him which I can't quite put my finger on. Mr Bennet is quite lively and capricious and he just wasn't really. His accent was also on occasions a little suspect. Matthew MacFadyen as Darcy OK but only OK - he certainly looked the part though.The problem with the film was the script and the direction - Jane Austen does Mills and Boons basically. The entire cinema groaned for example when Darcy marches across the misty moors at the end into the arms of a bosom heaving Lizzie. The cast really suffered from a sub-standard script, particularly Darcy. Now I appreciate this might be a bit purist of me - I realise that the content of the book needs to be cut down into a two hour film but absolutely unnecessary changing of dialogue and action which would have more authentically done the job just seems pointless. The screen writer and director obviously felt the need to make things clearer but ended up making all of the relationships less believable and so the whole point of the story was missed. Basically the book is about women but in this film it felt like modern women with modern needs, independence and attitudes in fancy dress. It's not that I have a problem with that approach as such - it just means that all of the tension, comedy, tragedy and frankly eroticism which make P&P what it is has been replaced with a huge pile of clichés which are a poor replacement.Subtlety is the key with Austen I think and this was not a subtle film.If I'd made this film and wanted to sell it, I would be concerned about my audience to be honest. Anyone who has read and loved P&P (or even just seen the TV version) is going to be patronised and irritated by this. The other 80% of the population will think it's a fairly reasonable (but clichéd) weepy / rom com which they get from pay per view on a Sunday afternoon because it's raining. Hardly Oscar winning.And one last thing. Darcy is NEVER funny. Pained yes, lonely yes, uncomfortable yes, awkward yes. Funny, NO!Just an added comment about needful3's determination that we should not obsess about the TV version and give this version a chance. I'd just like to point out that most comments have been based on a comparison with the book. I personally think that the TV version had flaws too but it benefited from more time to be able to let characters and story lines develop effectively I suppose. As you've suggested, it is indeed a beautiful film. This doesn't however save the film from a poor comparison with a much loved book. I'm just a little disappointed. And I really really think that Jane Austen would have been less than proud!",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Oh, Jane!""","It is a great film. I like it very much. I also love the book. I think, Jane Austen was a perfect writer and she had an amazing ideas. I'm so sorry that I saw only this version of this novel. But I'm going to see all versions of this Jane's novel. I love the plot a lot. I think, main character - Lizzie Bennet-Keira Knightley - was absolutely fantastic. But it may be true that she was so modern and she didn't fit to be Lizzie ( so older versions would be better ) but I like she in it. In my opinion, the atmosphere is great and really truthful. But maybe, there are some mistakes: Georgiana was really awful, costumes at the ball were too modern and so on. But, as I said, I like this movie a lot and I will recommend it to everyone.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdYGQxKaHT4",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Very enjoyable and passionate, but rapidly condensed","The cinematography and authentic time period setting were the two major selling points of the film. The movie was filmed so close to the action, so when combined with the commotion of day to day life, I felt as though I could slip right through the screen and into the late 1700's. There were some flaws to the time period, such as Bingley entering Jane's bedroom and what appeared to be water spouts in the Pemberley pond, but overall, a magnificent time period piece. Kiera Knightly was superb as Elizabeth - I had a difficult time finding fault with her on any front. Matthew MacFaden's Mr. Darcy was wonderful too. He was by far a different Mr. Darcy than Colin's Mr. Darcy - each of which were good in their own right, but it took me a little while to get over his sullen mood - he seemed more depressed than arrogant. He was still very desirable and his Mr. Darcy was much more passionate and interesting. The supporting cast were all delightful, but did think the director made a mistake by making Mr. Collins as sympathetic as he did. He was clearly not a sympathetic character in the novel, but the ""alone at the ball with a pathetic flower in hand"" scene elicited great sympathy. I did feel the screenplay was about as perfect as it could have been considering there are so many important sub plots that were essential to the story. Pride and Prejudice lovers would have tolerance (and desire) for a very long adaptation, so I was surprised they didn't make the movie a bit longer to prevent such a rushed story that bounced from one scene to the next. With so much dialog speeding by, it would be impossible for a person unfamiliar with the story to really understand the dynamics of what was going on. There was simply not enough communication between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth either. I was left longing for more. I did love the movie for many reasons, but wished it was about 1/2 hour longer. and p.s. I loved the gushy ending us Americans were blessed to receive! It was perfect.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
wonderful movie,"I found that this version of pride & prejudice was a great one. It did skip a few parts of the novel but it was still good. The A&E version is wonderful as well but too long. If you're looking for a quick Jane Austin fix ,and don't feel like reading the book, i definitely suggest watching this movie. Anyone who does not like this film must be crazy because Kiera Knightly does a beautiful job as Elizabeth Bennet and though the man playing Mr. Darcey isn't very attractive, in the end he pulls it off well and increases his character. Though some of her facial expression can be frightening she was overall grand. I had absolutely no problems with this film in comparison to the other, as well as the book.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A sweet, romantic story","Admittedly, I was a completely idiot when it came to Jane Austen before I saw this movie. I had never read the book, nor had I ever seen another film version of the story.However, that changed when I saw this Pride & Prejudice. Once the 2 hours were over, I was in tears and filled with a sense of romance that I hadn't felt in a very long time. This film was beautiful, in every sense of the word. The acting was enjoyable, the scenery pleasant, and the music breathtaking.In comparison to the revered '95 series (which I promptly bought at the mall when I finally found a copy), this movie was more intimate and emotional. It didn't revolve around the English society or the very important theme of marriage. This film was a display of the numerous emotional changes Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy endured in order to fall in love. It was a risky choice, and it worked.In an era where blockbuster movies are filled to the brim with overused special effects and dry acting, this movie was found to be a refreshing breeze, a pleasant time well spent.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Didn't match up to the A&E miniseries,"Sorry, but I much prefer Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, as well all the other actors in the television series, which I thankfully recorded.Nobody in the film version was anywhere as good as the A&E version, with the notable exception of Dame Judy Dench. Her part was beautiful, of course, And this is grousing about acting styles, but NOBODY could be better as Darcy than Colin Firth, and McFadyen was a poor second. And the mother in the television version was simply marvelous, as was the embarrassing Kitty. And Wickham was perfectly cast as a deceiving but charming scoundrel.Plus the character of Jane in the television version was perfectly portrayed. And of course, Jennifer portrayed Elizabeth wonderfully.And I can't forget to mention Crispin Bonham-Carter, from the renowned family of great actors! And many other 'supporting' roles. All beautifully portrayed.I almost put Robert Hardy in this mix, but then remembered he was in Sense and Sensibility. He has such a long and distiguished acting career that it's easy to imagine him in any notable role. But not in this series! Golly, I'll have to get the tape out and watch tomorrow!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
GREAT MOVIE-->best ever,"This is by far the greatest romance movie, if not the greatest movie, ever made. I have to say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen did a phenomenal job creating love between Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy. All of the actors in the movie seemed like they portrayed their characters exactly how Jane Austen herself would have wanted it. The scenery is beautiful, the script is brilliant. Overall I think this movie deserves five stars. It has thousands, if not millions, of people wishing that this could happen to them. The love that Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett have is very powerful and many people want that in life. This movie is a perfect example of love and romance. These two love each other very much even though they fight. It shows both sides of love. Watch this movie, its great.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mrs. Darcy...Mrs. Darcy...Mrs. Darcy...(best movie line ever!!),"After having seen the movie twice I can say without a doubt that this is now my favorite movie. Didn't hurt that it's based on my favorite book! While the book is better, everyone always says that, the movie ""gives"" more visually...that being Matthew MacFadyen as Mr. Darcy of course. He was perfect! As his character grew in his love for Lizzy and we witnessed his expressions change on screen it was utter magic. And Kiera as Lizzy was perfect casting, she is stunning. The musical score is beautiful and almost haunting...you can hear it in your soul even days after you've seen the movie. And please don't assume this is just another chick flick, oh how I hate that term, my husband has seen it twice too, and our teenage sons have each seen it once....they all loved it! Very deserving of the 10 I gave it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not what I expected,"I didn't like this as much as I thought I would. My expectations were pretty high because aside from the fact it's highly praised, a friend of mine also went out of their way to recommend it to me. So I was like damn, it must be something. I think I might have enjoyed better without all the recommendations.I didn't find many of the male characters likable or as laughable as some seemed to be portrayed. This meant that for a large part of the movie, I wasn't really rooting for any companionship. However, I loved the scene where the mother chases Elizabeth down; I thought it was funny.In general, I wasn't very invested in any of the characters. They were pretty typical, which made the movie predictable. You could easily tell which characters were going to end up together. Even though I hadn't read the book, I found it all pretty predictable. Rosamund Pike is usually praised for playing intimidating characters like in ""Gone Girl"" or ""I Care a Lot"" or less famously in ""Wheel of Time"", and there's always someone talking about how we just haven't seen enough of her movies because she also plays really wholesome characters, with Pride & Prejudice often mentioned. So, I was expecting her character to be radiant and scene-stealing, like a beam of sunshine, but that wasn't the case. I thought all the characters were just alright.The premise is similar to other period pieces of the time: lots of talk about who's going to marry whom and inherit what, whether to marry for love or out of need, and the limited prospects for women if they remained unmarried.I liked that the title made sense, Pride and Prejudice. The movie explores the themes you'd expect from any movie or series set in that time-society governed by class structures and social laws. Like, I liked the movie, but I thought I was going to see something special and different.I probably would've liked it better if I hadn't watched several period dramas beforehand, especially those made after Pride & Prejudice. Maybe it's similar to watching a really old sci-fi movie or drug lord movie from the 80s and not seeing what's so special about it because I've watched more modern movies that took inspiration from them, so the originals don't feel as special/unique.I'm guessing this is going to be a really unpopular opinion. I really thought I'd like it better and that it would feel special. It was alright, but it didn't live up to the praise I'd heard. It just felt like another period romance drama.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not my cup of tea,"If you love the book and know it well, do NOT spend ANY money on this film. I could go on and on about what bugged me, but it's already been said. I cringed so much during the film! Lizzie smiling so so much all the time almost, the pig in the house,the dialogue -oh how I missed the humour of the book, the little details. The only thing in the movie I thought improved from the 1995 version was Tom Hollanders portrayal of Mr Collins. But if you never read any books, this condensed version might suit you. On my part, I will watch Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle again instead, where you really feel all the strong and suppressed emotions behind the surface, where just one look will say so much.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
a world of discoveries,"My main discovery is that, starting now, Pride and Prejudice is the movie of my life. All in P&P 2005 is perfect. And I found out lots of things. I found out an fantastic actor who I didn't know, Matthew MacFadyen. I found out that Keira Knightley is much more than a ""pretty face"". I found out a new and promising director, Joe Wrigh. I found out I love Donald Sutherland and I didn't know. I found out how a book can be so well adapted (part of this thanks the wonderful Emma Thompson). The dialogs, the cinematography and the soundtrack, everything is sublime. And I rediscovery Jane Austen also. P&P is a wonderful social satire and, at the same time, it's a sweet romantic film without to be a foolish and lame love story.

excellent,I recently attended an advance screening of this movie. The 1995 BBC miniseries version is a personal favorite of mine but I think this new movie version has its own merits so I have to disagree with the comments from the viewer who stated that if you saw the miniseries you'll be disappointed with this movie version. This new version is much grittier than previous versions. The chemistry between Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen in the lead roles was electric. I also appreciated that the director went with a younger cast than we've seen in previous versions as that is more true to the book. I think it's a lovely version of the novel and could become the definitive movie version.,8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Top quality and a superb chick flick,"I did not know films like this were still being made in 2005. As a dating male, I can also tell you this is the best ""chick flick"" that you are likely to find at the local rental store. I am normally very cynical about movies and there are almost no recent films that I like, but I was amazed at the overall quality when I watched this recently with a girl at her place. You have the great classic timeless story that will never fail, a really excellent lead and supporting cast, wonderful direction that is as good as anyone in its attention to detail, and some of the best lighting and cinematography that I have ever seen.

Mr. Darcy has won my heart! I would die if I ever got the chance to meet him in person! His role as Darcy was amazing and I would love to see him more often in movies. Keira Knightley played an award winning role as Lizzy (although I wouldn't have minded being in her shoes for this movie). I have to say I was quite jealous of her in the last scene. I can't seem to stop talking about the movie with my friends, and they love it as much as I do. I can't wait for the movie to come out on DVD so I can buy it!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
This version is not all that bad!,"I have to admit I never saw the BBC series so I don't know why the critics are harsh. I liked the film. OK so it doesn't have Colin Firth and that Matthew MacFadyen looked ""nerdy,"" to the eyes of the fans of the BBC version but I loved the interaction between him and Keira Knightly. His Mr Darcy and Miss Elizabeth has attraction written allover. Both Knightly and MacFadyen are great. Her Elizabeth embodied the spirit of an independent mind who brought out Mr. Darcy from his dour prudishness to a passionate though still reserved but attractive man. Another couple who had great chemistry is Donald Sutherland as the patient and harassed Mr.Bennet and Brenda Blethyn as eternal nagging wife Mrs. Bennet. Despite appearances these two showed their characters love each and tolerate whatever imperfections they may have. Rosamund Pike is ethereal as Jane while Jenna Malone nailed the irresponsibly spoiled Lydia while Tom Hollander is perfect as the pompous Mr. Collins. I wasn't too keen with Simon Woods as Mr Bingley. He really looked like the nerd here but one can feel the earnestness he brings to his character's apology when Bigley confesses to Jane of his love for her. Dame Judi Dench's bit role as the imperious Lady de Bourgh reminds me too much of her Queen Elizabeth I turn in Shakespeare in Love. One can't help but feel she is in danger of being typecast. This movie may split Austen fans but it is worth watching even for curiosity's sake.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not just a cash-in, but marred by the star","Overall, I quite enjoyed this rendition. What it lacks in thoroughness and in acting (compared to the BBC), it makes up for with production values, which are thankfully not put to use. The cinematography is quite beautiful, especially when regarding the English countryside where some key tableaux occur, and the dinginess of the Bennett home is keenly brought into view in a clearer fashion than I've seen in most Austen interpretations. Finally, Joe Wright has a strong style, with some signature, abrupt reaction shots and other little flourishes I'm not knowledgeable enough to name, and ultimately, this helps the film be a worthwhile contribution rather than a half-assed cash-in type of remake. Kiera Knightley, however, did bug me, especially in the opening part of the film, which made me feel that, despite her age, she might have been better cast as Lydia, someone she probably resembles more closely. Every time she crinkled her nose laughing, she seemed to convey a lack of depth that didn't fit her character. I imagine marketability was, to put it lightly, the main reason for her inclusion.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best version out there fresh and lively,This adaptation was energetic beautifully filmed and captured the romance and passion of the novel with just the right balance. Compared to the BBC version with Colin Firth this is much better. The actress in the BBC version was too plain for a romantic lead.When I first heard Keira was going to play the role I thought she might be a little contemporary looking but I was wrong. She is quite lovely and does a very good job. Matthew McFayden as Darcy at first seemed a bit non leading man but he is quite a good actor and suits the role. The interesting mix of international (non British) cast members like Donald Sutherland and Jenna Malone is good.Liked the photography and settings. Darcy's house which is filmed at Chatsworth in England is a bit too grand for a Mr Darcy but it is lovely.Overall this was a very good adaptation and should be a standard for other adaptations of literary classics.,9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Well Shot, Well Acted Picture","Joe Wright's directorial debut showcases his talent behind the camera. Pride and Prejudice is filled with beautiful shots and excellent performances. In a story that is really driven by the emotions of the characters, more so than the nitty gritty of the plot itself, the direction is given a greater importance and Joe Wright rose to the challenge.Keira Knightley gives a great performance as Elizabeth Bennet, as does Brenda Blethyn as her mother. Keilly Reilly and Judi Dench also make the most of their brief appearances. The rest of the cast also does quite well.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"OK, I'm prejudiced but not  proud of it.","If you can sit through the first mindlessly boring half hour of dancing crowd scene (and stomach a few others; this director really gets his moneysworth from the extras) then you may find a spark of interest in P&P.Not though if you know anything at all about the manners and traditions of 18th century England.The whole premise of Austen's writing was based on certain elements which are totally lacking in this movie. For instance, the Bennetts were a respectable, well-heeled family of good stock but in that society, riddled with class awareness and false values, far below anything Mr Darcy could have been expected to marry into.....unless the object of his affections was so totally captivating that he couldn't help himself.It was Elizabeth Bennett's unusual charm and unconventional ways which totally captured him and made him flout what were the very, very strong conventions of the day.However, what we were given were Bennetts who looked little better than street people (uncombed hair, shaving stubble, no periwig when company called, and a dress code which bordered on the barbaric)with no manners whatsoever (and manners were everything in Austen's day).Elizabeth was far from charming with virtually nothing to recommend her to the hide-bound Darcy - and a mouth so full of teeth it was a wonder they didn't all fall out on the floor when she smiled.So where was the winsomeness? Where the prejudice or the pride for that matter, except that exhibited by the wonderfully tart Lady Catherine (Judi Dench).Close your eyes and listen to Keira Knightley in this role and you'll hear Princess Diana; Mr Bingley could double for Jamie Oliver (complete with weird hair) and am I the only one in the whole world who does not see Keira as ""stunningly beautiful""? She is, as Darcy first states, 'tolerable' but only just. Forever-open, pouting mouth (which, in Austen's society would have spoken of abject stupidity) and constantly scruffy appearance betrayed absolutely the smart, funny, and witty Miss Bennett Jane Austen portrayed.There was so much wrong with this movie that it hard to remember that it was made for fun and entertainment and not meant to be (like the book) a dissertation on 18th century manners, just a wildly inaccurate bit of froth for the overseas market (Americans will love it I suspect)which made little or no attempt to stick to what Austen intended.Yes, I'm a grumpy old curmugeon but I went into the movie expecting some attempt at least would be made to show us what P & P was all about and how love can conquer even the most rigid and iron-clad tradition. Alas, the disappointment and hence the grumpiness.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Joyful, energetic, earthy, committed - breathtaking","I must admit that, after seeing the fabulous BBC miniseries (with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as D'Arcy and Elizabeth) that a film version would be a poor patch-- a hurried story-line, banal dialogue, ... the list could go on.Well, I was mistaken. This film is brilliant: tautly directed and scripted, with earthy dances and gestures which speak volumes. This is an excellent work of theatre, a brilliant piece of art, a superbly thought-out film.The supporting cast are stellar: and it seems churlish to put some ahead of others. As Mr and Mrs Bennett, both Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn are good. Mrs Bennett can be tiresome and rather manipulative. Deftly played by Brenda Blethyn, she is tiresome but a product of her times.Tom Hollander (Mr Collins) has some marvellous comedic moments, and the physical theatre moments (his shortness) are used to excellent effect. Simon Woods gives Bingley the air of a buffoon, but a likable one at that. Stellar performances from Rosamund Pike (Jane) and Keiira Knigjhtley (Elizabeth).As D'Arcy (Matthew Nacfayden-- a superb performance) and Elizabeth reflect the PRIDE and PREJUDICE of the title, and alter as it dawns on them that there is a genuine love, the film holds its own.It is one of the best classic adaptations I have seen: the committed cast are true to the SPIRIT of the novel.An unpretentious film, glorious, emotive, well worth seeing.

"Enjoyed every minute... amusing, romantic and spirited...","I loved this movie. I did see the original BBC series too... this movie compares very well. Colin Firth's Darcy was intriguing and well-played in the old version, which originally gave me a fascination with the story, and compelled me to read the book. Matthew Macfayden's Darcy is also brilliant; he smoulders with hidden layers of passion and turmoil, with an engaging edge of vulnerability. He is able to convey a worried, haunted look in his eyes that speaks eloquently of his thoughts. This worked well in the BBC's Spooks spy series (when his character went off the rails)... he uses it to powerful effect in Pride & Prejudice too.Kiera's Elizabeth is not as plain as the one described in the book, but it does not really matter, as Kiera completely inhabits her character, with a lively, spirited cheekiness that lights up the screen.Judy Dench was magnificent in her role... formidable! At times even her (very tall)hair seemed to quiver with an air of imperious rage.I would recommend this film to anyone who loves Jane Austen, costume dramas, satire and romantic comedies.

The perfect formula - definitely a top ten!,"Though I admit, I can be a hopeless romantic at times when my friends and I are chatting about relationships and what have you, this film was fantastic. It had the classic story line from every love story over the years that ever made me leave the movie theatre wanting to fall in love and the talented acting of Keara Knightly and her co-stars to boast of. This film has the perfect formula.Brenda Blethyn (Mrs. Benet) sarparkled as per usual, once again taking on a role that she played as if it was meant for her. Matthew MacFadyen (Mr. Darcy) was mysterious and strong from the outside, though he brought a sense of weakness to the role that we only saw (and rightly so) when he was with Elizabeth. Keara Knightly herself shone out from the crowd as well as she walked, shoulders straight, a slight smile across her face across the screen in the opening scene; I was lost to the world of Jane Austin already! I haven't seen the mini-series of 1995 but from what I have heard, it was a hard act to follow. Personally, I believe that this film was definitely in my top 10; the casting was unfaltering, the set was breath taking at times and the film as a whole was simply marvelous! My only reservation was that they had cut the story line of when Mr. Darcy goes to find Mr. Wycombe. However, I didn't feel it made any real difference to the overall script and if anything, helped us focus on the real matter at hand; the struggle of love between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.If you haven't seen this film already, then what are you waiting for! This film will have you laughing at the ridiculous Mr. Collins, crying at the tears of a father and the happiness of a daughter and smiling with joy at the line ""If your feelings have not changed since last April ma'am then tell me so now. But if they have then I am inclined to tell that my feelings and wishes are still the same..."" This film is not to be missed and will have you leaving the movie theatre either wishing to fall in love, or clinging to your 'other half' in a renewed love.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
name of statue?,"Loved the film. Ms. Knightly is brilliant in her ability to convey so much with such subtlety. I was surprised that I enjoyed Matthew Macfadyen's Darcy more than Colin Firth's. His warmth and vulnerability was more realistic, though Firth's iciness was. The catch-my-breath scene, for me, has to be at the very end as he's walking toward Elizabeth in the early morning mist. That is the BEST walk!!!In the scene when Elizabeth and the Gardiners tour Darcy's Pemberley house, they all end up in a brightly lit room full of marble statues. There is one in particular that is, as Jane Bennett would say, ""breathtaking"". Does anyone know the name of the statue Elizabeth Bennett is looking at, that is of a female, standing, wearing a veil with a crown of flowers? Is this a real piece, or one that was made solely for the film?? She looks at this statue right before we see the marble bust of Mr. Darcy. Anyone?",,Anonymous,Romance
good but not great (as compared to the BBC version),"Overall the movie looked beautiful and was quite well (not very well - quite well) acted, although it seemed to be rushed and may not have been perfectly cast. I did think that Mrs. Bennett and also Judi dench, of course - of course, did particularly excellent jobs. Even before i saw the movie, though, i couldn't quite accept keira as Elizabeth Bennett, she strikes me as being too anorexic to be a Jane Austen heroine but still she did do her best in her role. I think like most other fans of P&P, i may be prejudiced by the BBC version, since that certainly was a longer, more extended, and therefore more faithful version of the novel. The new movie version may have had a larger budget and a more recognizable star roster to it, but as i said before i felt it edited out too much of the book and did not contribute as much character development (even for minor characters) as i would have liked. This actually just may be a problem for all movie versions of great novels, although i did not think this of Emma Thompson's sense & sensibility or the adaption of persuasion. However, the cinematography, costumes, locations, etc. were all great to look at and i did admire the camera work particularly in the ball scenes, which were perhaps better done than in the quieter, more stage-like BBC version. Still the BBC version did have a greater Elizabeth and Darcy, so as I have said before the new version has a lot of prejudice to overcome.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A better film than your reviewer thinks,"Although the reviewer is right that there is not enough time to convey all the nuances of a novel in a film, that is the same for most adaptations. Forget the Colin Firth version. Keira Knightley is excellent as Elizabeth, Matthew MacFadyen does what he can with an underwritten part. His amount of screen time just doesn't give him the chance to convey everything from the book. The rest of the cast are also good. The audience at the cinema I was in laughed out loud on numerous occasions, so there is humour there. All in all I thoroughly enjoyed it. See this film as it is: a stand alone adaptation of a great novel. It hasn't the depth of the original book, or the time to develop the story fully like a TV series, but makes for an entertaining evening out.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Since first published almost 200 years ago, it became a basis for a lot of romantic plots - like Bridget Jones's Diary and You've Got Mail.Having watched the 1995 BBC production, which starred Colin Firth, my only complaint to this film is that it's too short and fast-paced - but certainly it shall attract more viewers. The story is a combination of humor, witty dialogues and romance; it's a tough road for both Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, but they learn that they are not always right and changed - for the better.Watch out for some comical characters - Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins - try not to laugh too much.This movie I hope would catch attention from our youth and young at heart alike, because the plot was dearly directed to squeeze a 6-hour screening time from the British Broadcasting Company into a 2-hour film. Of course nothing still beats a reading of the book; there are a few misses, as what happens when books are translated into movies, but the hits are WORTH the watch. It's a very interesting starter for those who have been SOOO BORED with English classic movies, because the plot is as FRESH AND TOUCHING as before as it is today.I had never read a classic book in my life until I got curious with the book the character Kathleen Kelly was reading and talking about with Joe Fox in You've Got Mail. Remember the scene at Cafe Lola when Meg was holding a book with a red rose inserted in it, waiting to meet Tom Hanks? Yeah! That's the book, Pride and Prejudice. Thanks to this slight introduction, I've become acquainted with Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy, and so much enjoyed reading it, that I named my email after Mr. Darcy, the gentleman in the story. Too much description of them would be a spoiler.Go watch it!!! Although I personally felt that Kiera Knightley had come on too strong, the movie is still simply awesome. Being nominated in the best actress category, the musical score category, and the best director category, I'd bet for the musical score and the best director. Cheers for this movie!!!If I can only watch one movie this year - definitely Pride and Prejudice.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Could Jane Austen be any more slap-dash?,"I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice and was really looking forward to the remake. But what a slip-shod affair it turned out to be! Vital story lines excluded and improvised dialogues inserted at will, no continuity or factual correctness regarding the locations (does Joe Wright even know where Derbyshire is?) or the style of life back then (Bingley walking in on Jane IN BED?).Kiera Knightley left me speechless at her complete lack of acting talent, especially alongside Judy Dench and Donald Sutherland. Rosamund Pike was also very well cast but those were the highlights of the film. There was little emotion, the whole discussion surrounding pride and prejudice was absent...Mr Darcy looked ""vexed"" but little more. Definitely NOT proud.If the BBC does something, then they do it damn well. Why try to make a Hollywood rehash of it? Did Joe Wright even read the book beforehand? He certainly hasn't seemed to have understood it. All in all, an insult to British cultural heritage.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Romance in Subtlety,"To put it succinctly, there's something beautiful about director Joe Wright's adaptation of Jane Austen's famous novel, Pride and Prejudice. Maybe it's the stunning British vistas that appear on screen, completely saturated in subtle tones of yellow, green, and blue. Maybe it's the delightful and classically poignant musical score that meanders unobtrusively from scene to scene. Maybe it's the understated, but expert performances given by a stellar cast. Or, maybe it's simply the fact that Pride and Prejudice is a pleasure to watch.Jane Austen's original novel is legendarydetailing the affairs of the predominately female Bennett family (five girls in all) as they all attempt to find love in a time period where convenience and ignorance were the most attractive qualities in a partner. The eldest Bennet girls, Lizzie and Jane, find out directly that first appearances can sometimes be the greatest form of prejudice and falsehood.Director Joe Wright succeeds because he's not afraid to embrace a style that is unpretentious, but also engaging. During a visually majestic ball scene, we are treated to a long, impressive shot that dollies from room to room, following each character as they interact with other guests. Outside the Bennet household, the camera moves from window to window, detailing the actions of all the inhabitants inside. It's a visual treat to be sure, but it also seems that in the process Wright creates an authentic worlda cinematic realm that appears to exist long after the camera has stopped rolling. As a result, Pride and Prejudice has managed to surmount one of the biggest problems of contemporary romances: we actually care about the characters.And, what characters they are. Young Kiera Knightley excels as the quick-witted and skeptical Lizzie Bennet, finally putting to rest her ostentatious pout and delving into Austen's literary subtlety. Matthew Macfadyen plays the stern and ""disagreeable"" Darcy with enough pizazz to make even the legendary Colin Firth blush. But, beyond their separate performances, the sparks really fly when the two leads share the screen together. Here the romantic tension is so palpable that every handhold feels like a long passionate kiss. Every brief touch is charged with sexual energy. The supporting players are equal to the precedent set by the leads. Donald Sutherland stands out especially as the Bennet patriarch, both loving and smart. His wife, played deliciously by Talulah Riley, is both comedic and convincing as the woman who wants all her daughters to, above all, find a match that is financially sound.Pride and Prejudice proves that romance is more about chemistry and atmosphere than showy smooches or diamond rings. The entire film simply feels authentic. And, in the process, it shows how sexy subtlety can be.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Greatest Love Movie I ever saw,"I am not a very sentimental or sensitive man. I am just an average man in those departments, but I really loved this movie. It was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. Keira Knightly delivers the performance of her lifetime. All the other characters are also very good. This movie really made me feel good somehow. It was just so good. I recommend it to everyone. It's not a chick flick like it might look like. Too give you an idea, I will say that I usually watch fighting/martial arts movies. When I decided to watch this movie out of pure boredom, I found a very cultured, beautiful movie. I am going to buy it for DVD soon when I get a chance to go to BlockBuster. Great movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Incredible version that improves with each viewing...,"After seeing both, I have to say that I felt that the BBC version did not make Elizabeth as true to the book. It truly is fine work, however, Elizabeth lacked strength in comparison and was put down in the BBC version where I felt she held her own in the book. Colin Firth, as handsome as he is... and as well as he did with the role, Matthew offered subtleties in the acting that both came across as more genuine and sympathetic to the growth of Mr. Darcy as he falls in love with and expresses his feelings for Elizabeth. (... and when he finally smiles, what a warm and joyful reward!) I enjoyed both, but I have to offer a counterpoint to some that I read as I strongly preferred the newer version... call it blasphemy, but at least I admit it. Love all your comments!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
More Jane Austen crap.,"First of all, what a dull novel! I, like many other defenseless (ex-) school kids, was tortured in English class with this overrated drivel. No, not Mark Twain or Edgar Allan Poe. No, it's Jane Austen's soap-opera nonsense for the 19th century that is so often chosen for literature classes all over the (English-speaking) world.A bunch of hormonally-stricken, very bored sisters (there was no TV or internet back then) play a game of ""who-gets-whom"", while a parade of men strut around, hoping their alpha-maleness and/or cash will impress the lonely/solo/unpicked/free females that surround them and regularly foam on the mouth. This crap gets yet ANOTHER version to its name, as if all the BBC shows and other movie versions weren't enough. Every time one of those sisters excitedly screams about some officer or hot (or rich) stud, I wanted to press ""stop"" on the remote control.Pride? Prejudice? Don't be fooled by the pretentious title, all ye who art uninitiated. This is NOT a ""deep"" account with insightful or dare I say philosophical aspects. It's your average 25-cent pulp novel all wrapped up in nice (read: old = respectable) clothing. Occasionally, some character will say something semi-intelligent, but it's not much more exalted than the usual fortune-cookie stuff.The cast. Keira Knightley is an unbearably poor choice to play the ""hottest"" sister, the female lead. She is as unsuitable for this role and time period as she is to being an actress. Very little talent, and ""charisma"" that consists of the viewer feeling sorry for her for her anorexia and lack of breasts. She is, however, at her most annoying when she SMILES: she does look like an alien in those moments. Watching her silly-shaped mouth form a smile made me squirm and sweat, and believe me it wasn't sexually exciting or anything like it. But why wonder? She is the daughter of successful actors, i.e. the doors were all open for her from day one. Jena Malone was cute and lively, Brenda Blethyn is a good actress, Macfadyen is a good choice for the ""legendary"" Darcy, but all of that isn't nearly enough to save this crap.Pride? Prejudice? Feel free to be prejudiced against this crap (i.e. don't watch it) and your pride will remain intact. You can proudly say: ""I did NOT watch the latest Jane Austen drivel!"" I wish I could say that!(If you want to check out my extensive Hollywood Nepotism List, with over 400 photos/entries, contact me by e-mail.)To get rid of some of your frustration and annoyance which this harmful comment may have cause, click ""no"" below.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Great movie, despite its flaws...","I went to watch the new adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel ""Pride & Prejudice"" knowing that the lead actress, Keira Knightley, was nominated to an Academy Award. While the Awards may not always be accurate, I had big expectations of her performance in the movie, and sadly, i was disappointed. Despite this, the movie is a brilliant adaptation of the classic and makes justice to Austen's work.Knightley plays our main character, Elizabeth Bennet; who is a woman with a strong will uncommon in her age. Her family has economic troubles, increased by the fact that her father, Mr. Bennet (Donald Sutherland) is old, and since none of his five daughters has married, with his death the property will go to the next male relative. For this reason, her mother (Brenda Blethyn) is completely obsessed with getting her daughters married.Nothing of this matters for Elizabeth, since she has a bad opinion of men, an opinion who seems to be confirmed by Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfayden), a man who has just come to the village with Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods),a rich man who falls in love with Elizabeth's older sister Jane (Rosamund Pike). Darcy's apparently is a selfish arrogant man full of pride and this may confirm Elizabeth's opinion about men, or is this just only prejudice? Jane Austen's novel is adapted to screen one more time in the debut of Joe Wright as a director. Deborah Moggach's screenplay is remarkably good and the adaptation is quite accurate. While it is not the most faithful adaptation, it is the most adequate, as it keeps the spirit of Austen's work and its everlasting charm. It is not free of flaws, as the very short screen-time of Mr. Wickham (Rupert Friend) truly affects the power of later actions of the main characters.Nevertheless, Joe Wright makes a very good job as a director, and he gives us images of enormous beauty and is capable of printing the soul of the written word in film. The superb camera-work is outstanding but at times, its beauty seems to overshadow the cast.This takes me to the film's weakest link. Don't get me wrong, most of the cast have done a great job, particularly Tom Hollander as the Bennet's cousin, Mr. Collins; his performances is remarkable and gives a sympathetic view to his pathetic character.The problem in the cast, is that the two main characters are very strong and in stands the backbone of the tale, the clash of two very stubborn and strong wills, however, in the film both Knightley and Macfayden lack that strength and make the characters not as believable. Keira Knightley's performance is a bit above average, a disappointment considering she was nominated for this movie, although she manages to carry the film with grace. The problem is that Macfayden gives a very poor acting as he seems unable to transmit Mr. Darcy's powerful presence.However, this flaw doesn't hurt the film and ""Pride & Prejudice"" remains a great film adaptation. Maybe it won't be the best of all, but is a good version that fits quite well the current times. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly superior to the famous BBC series,"A superb supporting cast and stunning locations added to nuanced (MacFadyen) and engaging (Knightley) performances in the lead roles easily overcome a few directorial over-indulgences, making this a very good film indeed.Not afraid to challenge the BBC on their own ground, in particular in the opening extended ballroom sequences where music, dancing and dialogue all work together to draw you in to the period, this is not a slavish imitation either (no, there's no wet t-shirt scene), indeed this film keeps perhaps more close to the book than did the BBC, most notably in a much less cringe-making portrayal of the mother (Blethyn).Although only the central pair are actually much beyond caricatures, that's really the fault of the book, and the film succeeds precisely because those two really do engage you believably in their respective struggles to overcome, well, yes, pride and prejudice.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Complete Departure from all 3 previous versions.,"I was bowled over by the revolutionary break from ++elegant++ traditional P&P houses and settings characterizing the earlier P&P versions; absolutely wonderful and so much more what I imagine the reality was of that place - country England - and time. I was very disappointed with some of the dialogue which was so contemporary, and with what the script writer/s left out, some scenes where the dialogue faded away to nothing. Worst of all, for me, the speech was so fast in places it was unrealistic and very off-putting. Lastly, Elizabeth - Kiera Knightley is extremely attractive, but the world's greatest actress ?? Give me a break ... compared to the 1980s and 1990s Elizabeths, Kiera was very superficial. She has an extremely expressive face and is very attractive ... but her voice ... ugh! Overall though, a fabulous addition to the collection of P&Ps!!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simply a lovely film and not just for the girls,"Just have to say, as a 27 year old bloke i required a bit of arm-twisting to go to see this. Having taken a sabbatical from 'chick flicks' since my last season of seeing a lady. But like the fake-reluctant wedding guest making his way to the dance floor (UK Peter Kay fans know what i mean) i was captivated from the off.From the opening dreamy shot of sunrise accompanied by the first chords of what is a beautiful classical soundtrack, this is a fine example of wonderful film-making combined with a really big heart.As most will know this timeless Austen classic is essentially the most plagiarised story modern cinema knows as it provides the framework for every single romantic comedy you've seen.Despite this there is a freshness about this movie as it teases great humour and warmth from many of the main characters. The director maintains a palpable tension prior to the inevitable 'Happily ever after' despite the certainty of the final destination. The journey before we get there is wonderful.From the lovable Bingley to the almost 'David Brent' like Mr. Collins there are many laugh out loud moments.For me, and no doubt most blokes who can give their machismo the night off, the funniest elements were seeing every awkward moment you may ever have had the misfortune of encountering first hand right there on the screen before you. From Mr. Collins' totally misguided advances to Bingley and Darcy in a fluster as they struggle to muster the 'L' word.Naturally Keira Knightly plays a well-pitched Lizzy with just the right amount of independent spirit paired with her unflinching quest for love above all.As Darcy, Matthew MacFadyen, does rather overdo the brooding, skulky approach, looking positively disinterested with proceedings early on, though the ladies may disagree. He resembles Oscar the Grouch early on and becomes much more the smouldering type as scenes develop.Donald Sutherland is the stand-out performance bringing one of the most convincing portrayals of fatherly love to the screen you will see, and though some will say the ending is cut short it is his love that gives this film it's fitting parting shot.In all honesty, the ladies are probably going to see this anyway, but fellas, seriously this is a lovely, funny film that will leave you feeling all warm and glowy without the sickly aftertaste of so many of its imitators. The best compliment I can give this film is it made me want to be more romantic and i couldn't even say who with. A lovely film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Lizzie is well cast, but Darcy thinks it's called Grump & Prejudice","In early 19th century, rural England, opinionated young Lizzie Bennet (Keira Knightley) falls for, and simultaneously despises, the proud Mr Darcy (Matthew McFadyen). If you like a romantic 'bonnet' comedy there's a lot you'll enjoy in the third movie adaptation of the Jane Austen novel. The beautiful Knightley plays Lizzie with just the right measure of fire and youthful intolerance. Opposite her, alas, is a sulky and sallow looking Darcy, who seems to think the movie is called Grump & Prejudice. Nevertheless, the rest of the characters thrive in an atmosphere that's over art-directed, but more pleasantly bucolic than the mimsy elegance of some BBC adaptations. Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet must be old enough to be the girls' grandfather, and Brenda Blethyn, as Mrs Bennet, looks drunk, but, by Jove, they're having fun!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Oh so very boring,"Sometimes directors really make you think, make you stop and consider their work, make you want to never ever see anything in the cinema ever again because they have killed any desire you might have felt for moving pictures. Wright has almost managed to do this.I mean, how does one go about transforming Austen's Pride and Prejudice, a book full of wit and humour, into something so dreadfully boring? And I can't blame the dialogue, because a lot of it was lifted directly from the book. And I can't blame the actors because I've seen them do so much better in other works, and there is one scene in this film that hints at how good this film could have been. Who is left to blame? Well, the director who instead of giving us a romantic comedy instead decided to show off his camera skills.Ohh, look at the countryside. See the strange camera angle. And what was with the porcine fetish? Did I really need to get that close to a pig's testicles? The one good thing about this film, it was so terrible I was actually in fits of laughter in the middle of it. Never before has seeing some one walking, walking, walking through the misty countryside been so humorous. I'd swear I laughed for ten minutes. And I so wanted to just shout out ""How lame is this entire film"" but I resisted out of courtesy, although I'm not quite sure if anyone who enjoyed this film deserves any respect at all.It may seem like I'm being a bit harsh on this film, but that is only because it deserves it. Knightly looked ridiculous in her costumes. All they did was emphasize how flat-chested she is (something that didn't crop up in Pirates), and made her look, well terrible. And speaking of terrible; Matthew McFadyen, what the hell happened to you? A man who was great as the taciturn, withdrawn character in Spooks, is here a pasty-grey faced twit.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Most Luminous film,"I was having one of those days where I was just fed up with everything. So I left work early, and into the quiet recesses of a darkened movie theatre to watch Pride and Prejudice, a movie that is so luminous in its every frame. Keira Knightley is perfectly cast as the assertive Lizzy Bennett, her every movement so full of expression and subtlety, you find yourself captivated by her. The contents of the plot was not known to before I saw it, nor did I have any knowledge of the kinds of books Jane Austin had written.

Even though it all feels very dated (and of course this is a period piece) the feelings between Lizzy and Mr. Darcy are very real and moving.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hopeless Romantic,"Some people are talking about how this movie can't be amazing because it is only two hours. They are completely wrong. My friends and I went to go see it and we were still talking about it an hour later. This is the movie for any hopeless romantic. The whole movie is romantic. You will leave wanting to fall in love. This is a feeling that is not common anymore, because of divorce, infidelity, and abusive relationships. The movie takes you on a ride that you don't want to leave when it is done. I love the previous versions of this story, but this one is also amazing. Everyone of them is different, but that makes them so much more interesting. Would you want to watch a film that was just like the last version of the film? This is a timeless story and watching two people fall in love on a big screen is amazing. This isn't a action film with love on the side. Or a romantic comedy that is so sappy. This is a romantic film. I would suggest grabbing all of your girlfriends and watching this movie. I do not think that there was a single girl in the entire theater that did not enjoy the movie.

New look at an old classic,"I am an avid Jane Austin fan and have read all of her books several times. Her stories never get old. My favorite book of all time is Pride and Prejudice. The story of the romance of Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy is timeless. Whenever a movie comes out that tells the tale of my heroine, I am anxious to give it a look see. This version gave me a fresh look at my favorite. I always measure the film to the trueness it stays to the original. On that score, I was middle of the road. I have to say that the actors chosen for the main characters were a great choice, however Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennett is not British and fell short for me there, but in the movie he showed a more caring father than the original character ever was. The little add ins showing him in tender moments with his harpy wife and the scene he had with his bookish daughter Mary were sweet and a surprise for me. Keira Knightly was spot on for Elizabeth. Viewing Longbourne as a true farm sort of shocked me but that's what it really was I suppose, otherwise how is an estate to support itself? Time constraints of making a film two hours already takes out essentials and character development that is essential for a Jane Austin adaptation. Lots was left out and things added. I have to say as a film that stands on it's own, it was a good film and the period costumes and scenery were excellent. However, staying true to the book, it fell short for me.",,Anonymous,Romance

It made me want to be a Bennet, it made me want to live in a country house, go to balls and dressing in period attire.I decided afterwards that I would watch the previous version made by the BBC and after 10 minutes as I found it dull and boring. I much much much prefer all of the new actors and actresses opposed to those of the BBC series who I found dull and boring. Macfadyen was cast superbly for this role he portrayed the character of Mr Darcy so well it was a joy to watch, a great step into his film career, the chemistry between him and Knightley is electric. This stunning performance was shown throughout the entire cast as all were well suited to their roles: the giggling sisters, shy Jane, and proud Lizzie, they all bought the film together and made it such a success.Everything about this film is a joy to watch then acting, the actors, actresses, the directing, the music, the locations.

"Charming movie, well worth the money and time to see it","Ever since I saw the trailer I have anxiously awaited to see this movie. For those who have not read Jane Austen, this modern adaptation is a excellent way to recruit newcomers to familiarize themselves with her work. Viewing the trailer has enticed me to read the novel and then see the film.I have only two criticisms. First the movie is condensed to only 2 hours, excluding several events in the book. Moreover, the movie is abrupt towards the end.The second is that some parts of the script are too modern, straying away at times from Jane Austen's style. There were also minor inconsistencies between the actual time period of the book and movie.Overall, the performances of Keira and Matthew was very good. Both brought something new and interesting to the role of Darcy and Elizabeth...and they had incredible chemistry.If you are a die hard Austen purist that expects the movie to follow every detail of the book, you may not like it. However most of the audience will find it enjoyable and entertaining.I give it 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Superb,"I have read every IMDb review of this movie. The Brits come down hard on it, splitting 50/50 between ZERO stars and about 9 stars. One has to respect that, since it is their literature and because the BBC did a legendary multi-part series not that long ago that was superb.I viewed that miniseries. It is the sole reason that I undertook P&P, 2005. I found it a truly interesting story of its time. One gets a flavor how the laws of England regarding inheritance so profoundly affected the society (as well as the rise of the urban society over the rural society) so that ""a man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife"". My reintroduction to the story through this movie has caused me to start reading Jane Austen to better understand the socio-political setting (I suspect that another JA lives today in China or India, and will record their female-unfriendly situations for posterity, and in such a felicitous way).As to the actual movie: Superb. Most of the themes in JA's book are either 'exactly' run out in the movie, or else are presented in brief or at worst, implied. This movie suffers because it is only two hours long.Kiera Knightley is not the most beautiful actress. She was fun and steadfast in ""Pirates"". In this movie, however, she shows a range of emotion that is breathtaking, and I fall in love with her. Watch the scene in Mr. Darcy's house where they are inspecting the marble statuary. Then watch - what the heck, watch the whole movie. She deserved her nominations for Best Actress Oscar and other awards.Matthew Macfadyen as Darcy grows on one. He is prejudiced and stiff and overbearing, and he becomes human and handsome as this saucy, intriguing young woman steals his heart.Kudos to the rest of the ensemble. Rosamund Pike is so pretty in those first scenes as to overshadow - physically - Lizzy; but we come to see how Eliza is the pride of her father, and the equal of Darcy. Other portrayals make me turn to the books to better understand what's going on (the movie is only suggestive as to the deficiencies in some of the characters).Bottom line: This is a historical treat and a red-meat love story - not a ""chick-flick"". Either boy or girl are ones you would have wanted to woo in your wooing days.Heh.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Appalling. Truly Awful,"There's nothing wrong with bringing Austen into modern times by showing things that would have been unshowable back in her day, but this is not how it's done.The thing that many adaptations get dead wrong about Austen is that the tension in all of her work is dependent on the social limitations of the time. The strict rules around what can be said and done, and characters struggling to express themselves within those rules, is the essential core of her stories.This film makes it clear from the very first moment that those rules have been thrown out the window (Lizzy out and about without a bonnet?! What is she, a harlot?? She would never!), and the result is a love story that never feels like anything. With all the characters freely screaming whatever they want into each others' faces, there's neither suspense nor drama to be had.The locations and costumes are also very odd - these people look (and behave) more like peasants than gentry. The Bennet household looks dirty, unkempt and run down for some reason. I guess relative poverty is not a concept the director is familiar with, so we get some blatant signs of absolute poverty, just to make it clear that this is not a well-off family.I cannot fathom what people see in this boring slog of a film.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pride and Prejudice is absolutely amazing!!,"When I first saw Pride and Prejudice, I wanted to keep seeing it over and over and I fell in love with it!!! Now, almost two years after it came out, I'm so mad that it didn't get more attention in theaters that it deserved! After seeing the movie, and reading some of the comments on the book, I decided to read it! The book is breathtaking, and I had no idea that it could be so much better than the movie, even though the movie was wonderful! Jane Austin is fantastic!! I think everyone should read this book! and of course see this movie! Keira Knightley is amazing, and I think she was a very good Elizabeth Bennet. Talulah Riley, who played Mary, I felt kind of bad for her because she wasn't shown as much as the rest of the sisters, even though Mary isn't talked about much in the book either. Kitty and Lydia were always annoying with their laughs and things, but that's who Jane Austin wanted them to be. Mr. Darcy, was great! Played by Matthew Macfadyen, Mr. Darcy would show his acting through his eyes and his face. All the actors were very good. Mr. Collins played by Tom Hollander I thought was hilarious! It really disappoints me that so many people didn't like this movie, for me, it did take me a couple of times to get everything I needed to get, but to pack the whole book into a two hour movie, was very challenging!

Great performances by great actors,"I literally felt uneducated because I had not seen the first version and had heard so many good things about it from my family. I enjoyed this version so much I have watched it many times now. If you can be educated by a movie, I learned not to judge people to harshly until you know them well enough to stand in their shoes. If you watch movies strictly for entertainment value, this fills that bill also. Donald Sutherland was excellent as the father. He seems more like a father of those times than a lot of portrayals I have seen in other time period movies. Kierra Knightly was superb as a woman who is smart and able to speak her mind no matter the consequences. One of the attributes of a good film is the casting. All the actors came across exactly as the story was trying to be told. Judith Dench can do anything I am convinced. Her make up person deserves an award. Great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
In my opinion......,"In my opinion, I think this movie is perfect! It really sticks to the original novel. The music and casts are great! They gave me a elegant reflection ...how to say ...great feelings.Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen let the characters come alive! They are great actors! Keira Knightley is just like Elizabeth's reflection: wisdom, beautiful and strong minded! If you put Matthew Macfadyen and the 'real' Mr. Darcy in the same room, I think I won't be able to distinguish the differences between them.The reasons why I like this movie are: it's exciting but not like riding a roller coaster (which makes people felt like heart attack ); it's romantic but not nauseating; it's elegant but not overdoes and it's classic but not ancient (most of the students in my age always think that classic novels or movies which based on them are ancient, such as: 'Le Comte De Monte-Cristo', 'Moby-Dick', 'Les Miserables' ).To those who think that the original novel is difficult to read and the translated version is not so great (like me), this movie is music to ears!(If my spelling or grammar is a mess, please forgive me, cause I'm not good at English, I've done my best!)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Skillful Austen adaptation and a deeply romantic period drama.,"This film served notice of a new talent Joe Wright. His next film was the outstanding 'Atonement', but we can sense his talent in this version of Pride and Prejudice. The film tries its best to be cinematic (always difficult with Austen), and on the whole does well. The camera constantly moves and architecture is very skilfully filmed, conveying a wealth of information on what the characters are feeling. Keira is annoying initially, but her character slowly grows on you. Macfadyen is a bit bland. The rest of the cast is competent. The film works both as a first rate Austen adaptation, and as a deeply romantic period drama.Overall 8/10",,Anonymous,Romance
A rushed effort on the Jane Austen classic,"I write this review after I just finished watching the film. I must say that I compared this film constantly to the miniseries from 1995. It is clear that one cannot get the depth into the characters in such a short time of only two hours. So it's a bit hard to say anything really about the film that is fair in comparison to the miniseries. What I can say is this.I love Keira Knightley, she is pure joy to watch, such vivid and lively young woman. Her performance grew on me as the film moved on and in the end she did a good job. The other actors had so little time on screen that I won't criticize them for they weren't given the chance to shine. Only Mr. Darcy's performance left me a little disappointed, as he is the other leading actor. The overall feeling of the film was that it was rushed. An attempt was made to pace the film to make time to digest the characters and the plot. Although the scenery was breathtaking at times, those short attempts to let the viewer ponder on the film in peace did not accomplish their purpose. The film did improve a little towards the end but it could have been a lot better.As I've read the book and seen the 6 part miniseries, which by the way is highly recommended and includes Oscar worthy performances by Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, this film is a mere top of the pyramid. A million little nuances and witty dialog and subtle emotions are lost with the haste of the limitation of the two hours runtime. It is a good film yes, but not as good as it could have been.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love and Misunderstanding,"Jane Austen would probably agree that a gentle and loving mate is the crowning achievement of every human, whatever the epoch. Austen views from her perch in 1797 the ageless mating dance of our own peculiar species. Elizabeth is one of five young eligible daughters of the Bennett family, possessing only a modest fortune and income. They live in the countryside of England while geese and pigs tramp around the house. Darcy is a wealthy visitor who becomes smitten with Elizabeth. Meanwhile, misunderstandings are accumulated. The ability to correct misunderstandings enables the mating dance to end the prejudice and then the pride. However, this does not begin to fully describe the depth of emotions in this story. Filial devotion, fatherly solicitude, motherly hopes and fears, the concept of duty, the custom of arranged marriage, the loyalty of friendship and family, the discreet reticence and resulting incoherence of the age are described beautifully. Finally, the gentle love of a man smitten with a woman is the joyful climax. The courtly language and manners of the film reflect well the setting and habits of that unique period.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Young women with female leads...Keira Knightley,"To write about this movie is almost as difficult as watching it. Jane Austen wrote a novel that became famous in the whole world which has had, as other recognized books (""Vanity Fair"", ""Little Women""), lots of cinema and television adaptations; as well as lot of actors playing its main roles. In these specific novels I mentioned, the main characters are females.This takes me to my statement about how a young woman can carry with a movie by herself. Recently, Reese Witherspoon starred in ""Vanity Fair"" and she did an excellent job; but she was near her thirties. However, Keira Knightley (Oscar nominated for her role in ""Pride & Prejudice"") is only twenty years old, and Winona Ryder was twenty three when she became the soul of ""Little Women"".I don't mean to compare, but it's not acting talent I am comparing, but acting situations and character similarity. The acting situation is the chance of walking the red carpet having a nomination with twenty years or a little bit more. I don't know much, but I know that many men have been nominated while being young, but not many women.In this case, Keira would have more merit for being nominated being younger; but that's not the case. The character similarity is instantly felt. One of five sisters, Lizzie Bennet (Knightley) is not the eldest but probably the wisest about life, the most charming and the most difficult when it comes to love relationships; kind of what Winona's Jo March was like.Also in both stories, the five sisters have to be presented in society because they may be beautiful, but they are not classy or well known. As I see it on film, Luisa May Alcott's story is more about all of the girls, and Jane Austen's is focused on Lizzie's life. Either way, it's the actress who plays the character that has to stand out.Deborah Moggach had the task of adapting the novel to the screen, in her first screenplay presented in theaters worldwide. The words the characters speak are beautiful, and she puts them together professionally; I also said it when I wrote about ""Vanity Fair"". But for some reason, ""Pride & Prejudice"" is less bearable than the latter one, which lasts more than twenty minutes longer.Joe Wright, the director (and also in charge of his first project to be shown in theaters), also did an admirable work (achieving a perfect and unforgettable ending); perhaps too correct as Spielberg's direction of ""Munich"". Mainly, I guess it's the price to pay for adapting a novel in its whole form, or the fact that Winona Ryder and Reese Witherspoon had a noticeable cast behind them, that made the movie more entertaining.Here we have Donald Sutherland, who seems to be trying for an Oscar with roles as kind, old men (see ""Cold Mountain"", ""The Italian Job"") mostly fathers, which are always acceptable and notable. We have Mathew Macfadyen, who has got the role of his short career as Mr. Darcy, and who slows the movie down at times with his face of sadness; but the viewer understands it's part of his character.We also have Jena Malone, Brenda Blethyn, even Judi Dench and there's nothing exciting we get to see on screen. It's the incredible Keira Knightley who makes the picture only and just watchable. The young and beautiful actress has done little things with great results, and even though her portrayal isn't the greatest of all time, it becomes the high point of the movie and enough reason to honor her on growing gift.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Keira Knightley finally arrives,"Keira Knightley finally takes over as THE leading lady of her generation: look out Reese, Renee, Gweneth, etc. Keira is going to leave you in her dust. Reminiscent of a young Audrey Hepburn with the acting chops of Katherine Hepburn - Ms. Knightley more than carries this 2 hour movie - she takes the reins in her teeth and rides with it. Supported by an excellent supporting cast including Judi Dench, Donald Sutherland, Brenda Blethyn, Tom Hollander - all are worthy of Oscar nominations. It's been a long time since Albert Finney did the same feat in Tom Jones - where a period piece actually comes alive before your eyes. And the direction, photography and sets are all first rate. Much has been made of the leading man Mathew MacFadyan a relative unknown and he has been unfairly compared to Lawrence Olivier and Colin Firth. But I think with further viewings purists will come to accept his Darcy as very good. Expect this move to be in everyone's Top Ten lists of 2005",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good movie--if you haven't seen the 1995 Colin Firth version!,"I saw most of this movie a few years ago, and from what I remember it was pretty well done. It was enjoyable to watch, but since I've read the book and seen the 1995 Pride & Prejudice miniseries several times, this movie wasn't as enjoyable as it might have been. I guess this movie is more like a ""highlights of"" summary than a whole story. Sure, it does tell the story, but it feels too rushed. If you've read the book, you know that the story takes place over a period of at least a year, so it naturally moves somewhat slowly. The 1995 miniseries did an extremely good job of portraying the slow pace of the story, so anything shorter than those 5 hours really doesn't do the story justice in my eyes. I'm not saying this is a bad movie, because it is good, but if you've read the book or seen the 1995 miniseries, you probably won't like it that well. My recommendation is to just go read the book and then watch the 1995 miniseries.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Elizabeth Bennet is miscast,"Keira Knightley is not the Elizabeth Bennet of the book. Apart from this glaring mistake, the rest of the movie is good. The two elder sisters are supposed to be more dignified and substantial than the younger three. At some points in the movie, Knightley's Lizzie acts quite silly, which probably appeals to modern audiences, but is not in keeping with Lizzie Bennet's character. Furthermore, Lizzie is not supposed to be as good-looking as Jane. Her attractions are supposed to be more subtle. Keira Knightley is definitely better looking than the actress who played Jane Bennet. Again, I think this is to appeal to modern audiences, who just cannot have the heroine being upstaged in attractiveness by anyone else.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A superb movie, one of the best I've seen","The director, the actors, the cinematographer and the production design people -- and of course the screenwriter -- are to be commended for a wonderful movie. It was wonderful in many regards, and with all the baggage of being yet another version of what Jennifer Ehle starred in not too terribly long ago, probably the two most important *technical* elements were the very realistic reflection of how life was at the time, and the very modern and unstagey cinematography. Of course, the acting was great and save for my marriage and my age, I'd propose myself to Keira. Brenda Blethyn did, of course, do an outstanding job of characterization, as did Judi Dench, and all the other actors, including the male leads. All more than ably directed. (Anybody notice how ""ridiculous"" -- Elizabeth's words -- Mr. Collins looked like Paul Simon a while ago?)I applauded and said ""Bravo"" at the end of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I fell in love,"I balled my eyes out with joy over this movie. The romance of Pride and Prejudice was enthralling as it unfolded through its curiosities with intent and deliberation. MacFadyen and Knightley were beautiful to watch as well as everyone. This was such a gorgeous film that I watched it twice back to back. I could watch it again for the story and sub plots within regarding class and status were fascinating. Austen's classic story was given justice by this film. I fell in love with everything. Well done. A love story that broke me down as it pointed to the illusions within relationships. Intelligent, engaging, honest. I can't say enough how I enjoyed this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Beautiful Movie,"This is a beautiful movie. And I don't just mean in the ""touching"" or ""moving"" sort of way. It was actually very beautiful VISUALLY. The cinematography is breathtaking, showing the English countryside in such an artistic way - you would think it was a painting. It is accompanied by music that captures the story: both light and fun, but deeply emotional and beautiful. It was a joy to watch and to listen - visually stunning.The story itself is a classic and was fantastically told by Joe Wright. The acting is believable and gripping. Knightly, who is actually not my favorite, was laudable as Elizabeth Bennett. Jane is too adorable for words, and the characters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennett, Mr. Collins, and Darcy are played so well, you'd think they jumped right out of the novel and onto the screen.Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book, so believe me, I watched it with a skeptical eye. And I was not disappointed - Wright's Pride and Prejudice is fantastic!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent portrayal,"Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite novels. And as an avid fan, I must say that the movie excellently portrayed the novel. Granted, there were things that were shortened, edited, and left out. One can only expect that. The Masterpiece Theatre version, featuring Collin Firth, contained more of and followed the novel more closely, obviously. Because it was a mini series they were able to incorporate more. So one cannot argue that that version was better only because it was more like the book, given the circumstances and the fact that this was a movie, not a series. So for the time allotted and considering other circumstances, this movie was a very good adaptation of the novel, Pride and Prejudice.The movie itself was, I'll admit, modernized and Americanized (for lack of better words). It became more of a romance, than a tale of the prejudices of historical English society and aristocracy. However, it was still made clear that Darcy and Elizabeth were not considered equals, as well as it was pointed out the prejudices they both held towards each other. Although it was much more romantic and focused more on the growing love between Darcy and Elizabeth, the movie's title was NOT left unexplained. Pride and prejudice was evident and adequately portrayed in the movie--though not as fully as the 1995 version, still enough to follow the novel, while still appealing to the hopelessly romantic audience.The acting, as well, was superb in my opinion. First of all, Keira Knightley was absolutely amazing as Elizabeth. Absolutely. I am a big fan of her in all movies, but I thought she was especially excellent in this. She definitely captured Lizzie's pride, beauty, intelligence, stubbornness, and other qualities. I would go as far as to say that this might have been her best performance yet. Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn, as Mr. and Mrs. Bennet were excellent, also, which is expected, as well as Judi Dench as Lady Catherine. The rest of the cast was very believable and true to the novel, especially noting Simon Woods (Mr. Bingley), Claudie Blakley (Charlotte Lucas), Rosamund Pike (Jane), and Tom Hollander (Mr. Collins), all of whom I thought specifically brought Jane Austen's characters to life. The final character, who seems to be quite controversial, is Mr. Darcy, played by Matthew Macfadyen. Well, many seem to think his portrayal of the proud, aloof Mr. Darcy was not up to par. And where I can see that Collin Firth may raise the bar quite high, I must say that I though Matthew's acting was absolutely exceptional. Honestly, Collin Firth was a great Darcy, but there was just something missing. He played him excellently, yet just his appearance and overall self was just not what I had pictured Darcy to be (nothing against him, of course. I adore Collin Firth and find him one of the best actors in British ((and American)) film). Mattew, however, was the perfect resemblance to Mr. Darcy. He just had that air and appearance that I had pictured when I read the book.I happened to find his acting amazing, despite the controversy. In my opinion, this movie was a very good adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, one of the few pictures to ever rival the novel.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The Fallen Pride of the Critics,"Pride and Prejudice 2005 is a very good film, to put it simply. It is British in every possible way. Perhaps the script has adapted itself a little more than fans would like, it does not mean that the film lost it's 17/18th century English-ness.Before the film's release, many people expressed grave prejudices over the trailer, stating that it's too sexed up, and over Hollywood-ized. These people include critics and prominent writers. Die-hard fans of Jane Austen books were unable to see Keira Knightley play Elizabeth well. Basically, most of the reviews came before the show itself.That is a common problem with film today, and after watching Pride and Prejudice, it is easy to see why there are no more ""sexed up"" comments, because the movie is not sexed up at all. There is a genuine British conservative-ness in Pride and Prejudice, and most of the lovers hardly even touch each other throughout the film.Sexed up? No way. Pride and Prejudice is a cinematic experience not worth missing. With beautiful cinematography, consistent editing, and a very convincing performance all around (especially by MacFayden, who plays Darcy), Pride and Prejudice is a testament to how pre-release hype of negativity can be so utterly embarrassing.8/10",,Anonymous,Romance
Poor rendition of the original novel.,"The PP (2005) gave the original Austen novel a new, modernized interpretation. The effort was average at best. While the dialogues, social setting, and story were slightly changed to make the movie more modern, the movie failed to set the main themes of the novel. The ""pride"" and the ""prejudiced"" aspects of the novel were not fully developed. The father, Mr. Bennett, was portrayed more like a drunk rather than a country gentleman. The mother was painted more vulgar than the one in the novel. Mr. Colin's role in PP 05 was confused and vague. The Bennett girls, including the shy, beautiful and good nature Jane, were much more shrewd and scheming. I guess I was spoiled by the BBC version of PP of 1995. If you did not read the novel then you would have a hard time understand these key characters and their ""pride and prejudice"". My final scores: Suitable selection of actors/actresses: poor Interpretation of the original novel: poor Acting: average Cinematography: above average Scenery: above averageIf you want to watch ""Pride and Prejudice"", my recommendation is not to waste time with PP05. Do directly to PP95. It is longer, but a much, much better movie. I gave a 6 to PP05, and 9.5 to PP95.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great romance film based on Jane Austen's novel and starring Keira Knightley,"I had read the novel, and I had seen this film version of this story of love and life among English gentility during the Georgian era. I thought it might be a great romance film starring Keira Knightley (one of my favorite actresses), and as I said before, I love a good romance movie.The story starts (like in the original novel) when a wealthy bachelor named Mr. Bingley takes up residence in a nearby mansion, and the Bennet family is abuzz. Amongst the man's sophisticated circle of London friends and the influx of young militia officers, surely there will be no shortage of suitors for the Bennet sisters. Eldest daughter Jane, serene and beautiful, seems poised to win Mr. Bingley's heart. For her part, Lizzie meets with the handsome and, it would seem, snobbish Mr. Darcy, and the battle of the sexes is joined. Their encounters are frequent and spirited, yet far from encouraging. Lizzie finds herself even less inclined to accept a marriage proposal from a distant cousin, Mr. Collins, and, supported by her father, stuns her mother and Mr. Collins by declining. When the heretofore good-natured Mr. Bingley abruptly departs for London, devastating Jane, Lizzie holds Mr. Darcy culpable. I won't get you guys any more details; you'll have to see the film for yourself.Admittedly speaking, I don't have a favorite scene because I love the whole film from beginning to end. The only characters that I hate are Ms. Bingley and Lizzie's mother. I mean, god f***-it, woman! Let the girls live their own lives. You know, I think Lizzie is closer to her dad than her mom.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not funny,"I'm afraid I didn't make it through the first half-hour of this film. Sadly, none of the satire, irony and characterisation that is present in the book and the 1995 adaptation was present.The humour was simple. I was appalled by the portrayal of Bingley; making 'cheap' situation jokes which were not in the book. Bingley was too nice, not stupid. A group of young teenagers who were sitting behind me found it highly amusing, so I must deduce that they have never read the book.I couldn't stand Mr Bennet, he is not as quick witted as he was in the book, and his deep monotonous voice began to grate.I thought Mr Collins was rather good.Kitty and Lydia were spot on.Keira Knightly smiled far too much and I began to grow sick of her cheesy teethy grin.I won't get started on Darcy, all I can say is that I didn't fancy him; enough said.The scenes were very nice, although the Bennets never cooked their own meals. In fact, Mrs Bennet makes a point of it. I'm also sure that they were not farmers... not very 'gentlemanly'.Massive fans of the book and the 1995 adaptation will not like this film and I would strongly suggest that you resist the temptation to see it at the cinema and rent it out on DVD.I think it was a good way to get our money calling the film 'Pride & Prejudice', as it has little semblance of the true essence of the book.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Does justice to the book,"I rented this movie a few days ago rather tentatively. I enjoy a genuine romance occasionally but today's standards of 'romance' are typically sappy chick flicks with mindless cliché plots and poor attempts at acting. Having read Pride and Prejudice in high school and loving Jane Austen's many other works I was afraid the new remake would be another disappointment. I must admit that I tried watching the BBC miniseries and was not captivated enough to finish so I had no true desire to see another remake of the film. This one however was a beautiful adaptation that keep the essence of the period, its tongue-in-cheek humour and captured the genuine 'romance' factor of the film in a very well done (cheese-free) storyline that kept me interested throughout and left me quite satisfied at the end. The ultimate period free good film that one can rewatch over and over.The casting was brilliant and exactly how I had pictured them to look while reading the book. Knightley was a surprisingly believable Lizzie who captured the character's temperament and energy to perfection. Even Pike's subtle portrayal of the mild mannered Jane was brilliant. On need s to take the time to rewatch the movie like I did, to catch all the facial expressions and witty sidecomments.Now, I know there are people who can't help but judge this movie by the popular BBC version and the inevitable Darcy comparison. I for my part preferred the Macfadyen version because he was how i pictured Darcy in the book. Many seem to think that his was not prideful enough in his portrayal- however I've always believe that Darcy was seen as arrogant due to the social awkwardness and his affluent upbringing. Lizzie embodied pride (b/c she could forgive him for wounding her vanity upon their first meeting) while he was prejudice (due to his view of the inferiority of her circumstances) Overall, unlike the BBC version I found myself completely captivated by this film and fully immersed in its story.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"So glad I saw this 2005 version - director Wright with Moggach's screenplay, pairing of Knightley and MacFadyen as Lizzie and Darcy, is charming and endearing","A&E's 1995 mini series with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth will still be my favorite version of Austen's beloved novel, with adaptation by the prolific writer Andrew Davies and direction by Simon Langton. But this feature debut from director Joe Wright, with Deborah Moggach's screenplay of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is very much appealing and enjoyable in its own right. The production is superb. The cinematography by Roman Oshin certainly enchants - such facility with the use of natural lighting and optimizing the sun as an 'accomplice' to the visual beauty delivered. We are truly transported, particularly at the beginning and ending 'sun burst' scenes.The flowing music by Dario Marianelli, with just the right tempo and piano notes, provides the accompanying rhythm to the story progression. As we see people gathered for dancing at the assembly hall, we'd want to join in and dance along as well. The settings have such a down to earth tone and inviting warmth, especially being at the dining table or in the drawing room of the Bennet's. Brenda Blethyn is ever so lively and blithely as the matron of the family with five daughters. Donald Sutherland's Mr. Bennet underplayed is aptly low-key in just the right way. The scenes between him and Knightley were so well matched - the fatherly love for his favorite daughter glows as he sits quietly in that decision-making library. When we're outside, nature is in touch and there's constant birds chirping that we can hear.Keira Knightley, since first saw her in ""Bend It Like Beckham"" 2002 and thoroughly enjoyed ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" with her opposite Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp, is here with Matthew MacFadyen (who doesn't look 11 years senior to Knightley at all), and what a romantic pair they are. Rosamund Pike is sisterly Jane the eldest; talented Jena Malone is Lydia, the eloping one. Tom Hollander's portrayal of Mr. Collins is rather marvelously delivered - he gave it more of a human touch and comes across not at all 'odious'. Of course, Dame Judi Dench flawlessly delivered Lady Catherine De Bourg. The whole production is quite bubbly and ever effervescent with giggles and laughter. Every scene was thoughtfully choreographed, well demonstrated by the romantic arguing rainy scene of Lizzie and Darcy. (How cool is that.)I can see this version multiple times. It's a perfectly endearing film. Perhaps the fact that I haven't seen MacFadyen in any other film before helps. (Now I can catch up and see him in ""Spooks"" / ""MI-5"" British TV series.)",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not the same without Colin,"Had I never seen the '95 mini series of Pride & Prejudice, I think I would have thoroughly enjoyed this film. But I found myself comparing every scene to the stunning performances of Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, and frankly, it did not compare.Macfadyen's performance was commendable, however, I did not feel that he conveyed enough emotion. True enough, Darcy is meant to be withdrawn and ""strong and silent,"" as it were, but I think that for the majority of the film - even in the kiss scene - he simply looked bored.Compared to the 95 version, where Firth struck up the balance perfectly. He showed pride and nobility, but we can see undercurrents of emotion through his eyes, smouldering looks at Lizzie, and flashes of good humour.I also felt that the film did not capture the essence of the period. It quite irritated me that Keira wore her hair down in many scenes, as women of that status and age in that period simply would not have done in public. I also felt that we see too much of Lizzie and Darcy - the book focuses on many different story lines, and many of the more minor characters were completely overlooked, particularly Mr Bennett, who has an important role, and Mr Collins, who is not nearly so odious as I imagine him to be through reading the book.However, I have given the film a commendable 6 out of 10, because I feel that it stuck to the storyline quite faithfully, and the settings were quite beautiful. I particularly enjoyed the scene at the Meryton Assembly Rooms, which captured the novel very well. The film is well worth watching for Knightley's performance; I thought she made a very good Lizzie.But as good as this film is, if you want true Pride & Prejudice - stick to the 95 version.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Joyfully magnetic,"First and foremost I was inspired by the wondrous cinematography. I love the movement of the camera in and out of the wondrous ball attendees.

"Would have caused less agony, if had lasted longer",I felt the movie was quite forcibly rushed and pressed into its current run time. Even some of the lines were hurried more than their characters own unrestlessness would have justified.

Jane Austen for Dummies,"I realize many people will like this film but it is the equivalent of a Coles notes version of the Jane Austen novel. It is difficult to translate an entire novel into a two hour filmed presentation, however this version subtracted a little of the storyline from all over the place rather than just write out entire characters and thereby simplifying the story for its time frame. The viewer is left feeling confused and incomplete. This was most obvious in the lack of character development of Elizabeth Bennet's sisters. Most viewers, unless already acquainted with the story, won't even understand why they are all there, and if you audibly blink, you are likely to miss why Wickham is in the story at all. This abbreviated version also lacks historical accuracy. The Bennets are portrayed as impoverished farmers with pigs running the hallways, entertain friends in the kitchen, and dress like mill workers -- not the gentry and social equals of Mr. Darcy that they are, albeit not as wealthy. Their home is not portrayed as an 18th century Gentelman farmer's abode but rather as a 'shabby chic' interior. Austen's feminist concerns for her gender's inability to inherit is almost completely missed. Subtlety is abandoned in favour of over-modernizing situations and sets so that one feels they are being screamed at 'GET IT?' throughout the film. The director seems to miss that the only reason Miss Bennet and Mr. Darcy do not get together at the beginning of the film is due to pride and prejudice, not social class or breeding. Jane Austen is not just a romance writer, she is an acute observer of her times and its modes and manners. This film misses portraying these subtle although important elements of the storyline. This film has visual charm and artistic merit but falls well short of an authentic rendition of Jane Austen's classic.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

I don't understand the criticism of the acting; I thought all the actors were brilliant, especially Ms. Knightley, Mr. MacFayden, and Mr. Sutherland (but when is Donald Sutherland not brilliant?) I actually thought acting better than the 1995 version. They really captured the characters and made them more human and less stiff, especially the two leads.I have seen all of the other versions, and while I liked them, especially the acclaimed 1995 mini series, there was always something subtle that was in the dynamics of book, but in none the films. This film has it. It is hard to explain, but most can feel it.All in all: Acting, cinematography, directing, costumes, all great. There is nothing to not love about this film. It has truly captured the wit, the subtle passion and sexiness, the romantic air, and the clever flirting that made Jane Austen's book such an instant classic back in 1813.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Overall the movie adaptation is accurate, besides one flaw.","In my opinion, the movie adaptation of Pride and Prejudice is different from the novel in a negative way. Although the events that happen in the novel are the same in the movie, I believe that Elizabeth is portrayed differently than how she is described in the novel. In the novel, Elizabeth's hatred towards Darcy is completely obvious. However, in the movie, the viewer gets the idea that Elizabeth never actually hates him. Although Elizabeth gets into arguments with Darcy, just like in the novel, the viewer can tell that Elizabeth is infatuated with him. This makes the movie worse and not as interesting. Whether the change was Kiera Knightly's acting, or the director's choice, I believe it negatively affected the story of Pride and Prejudice.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Poetic,"I was in search of a good romance movie and god what a milestone it is to have watched pride and prejudice. I happened to read this book 2 years before and as a rowdy teenager I could not make too much from it then. Now I know clearly what a beautiful masterpiece it was.I was so unsure of Keira Knightley since her horror show in pirates of Caribbean series (which I happened to watch before pride and prejudice) but she was flawless. Her acting skills are being excellent and I could not take my eyes off her eye catching looks. The other impressive feature of this film is the background scenes, they were breathtaking. I thing the dialogs stole the show must. The screenplay have been well adapted. Since the novel itself was spectacular it would make less sense that I would talk about the story and the plot.I think this will go down in history as one of the best adaptations of novel ever made. Overall it is a must watch movie for romance lovers and I think it's a complete cinematic experience and a must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyable but flawed,"First of all, I enjoyed this version; I really did. What it got right is a more distinct sense of the darker and chaotic side of Jane Austen's worlds. There's a lot of melancholy here, which wasn't rendered in the preceding TV series. The Brits--though this time contaminated by French input, which didn't help at all; it seldom does--can do Austen very well indeed when they put their minds to it. The BBC version of Emma with Kate Beckinsale was so much superior to the boring Paltrow cinema version.Where does this latest production of P&P fail? The first problem coming to mind is the script. Adaptation is an art all of its own, and while the TV series had time to plot out most of the significant narrative strands of the novel, two hours of film doesn't. Purely from a scripting point of view, significant characterizations--'significant' in the sense that they contributed to the explication and bringing-to-live of the central characters--were far too 'pro forma', almost as if they were thrown in because the writer felt that they needed to. The result was that many of them had no function at all, and cluttered up the action and diffused the narrative focus.The second problem had to do with direction. The first half, with the aid of the muddled script, was confusing, unconvincing and occasionally annoying. I loved the deconstruction of the decorous superficiality that adhered to the TV series, and the occasionally chaotic social occasions; but in the end it got too much, and the interactions of the main characters were lost, instead of, as the director presumably intended, contextualized. Also, the sound was awful. The deliberate toning-down and made-hard-to-hear-above-the-din of individual conversations may have had an element of realism, but the strain of the listener, having to work out just exactly what was being said, didn't help one's becoming engrossed in the tale. The vacuous sisters and mother and their hysterical carry-ons also became annoying and were overdone and for too long.Third problem: Keira Knightley. She's a cool actress, who fits perfectly into King Arthur, Pirates of the Caribbean, Love Actually--but here she was very much miscast. If the producers had had any guts they would have cast the incomparable Rosamund Pike in that role, instead of wasting her in the nearly-invisible part of Jane Bennett. Rosamund was the one saving grace among the women of Die Another Day, and here, too, she basically stole the show without even trying hard whenever she appeared, whether she said or did much or, as was the case for the most time, not. Keira, by contrast, needs to act-by-effort since she doesn't as yet have enough depth of personality. Too much 'star' and not enough 'character'; quite unsuitable for this part. She battled her way through it valiantly, and I admire her for that, but it just wasn't 'right' for her. The mis-casting was rivaled only by the casting of Katie Holmes in Batman Begins.Fourth problem: just about all the male characters, except for Donald Sutherland, who can do no wrong. That the film should fade out with a shot of him was an unexpected stroke of genius. I wonder if it was scripted that way or a directorial decision.Having said all these basically negative things, I'd like to finish on a positive note, which is that in the second half, when the 'busy-ness' started to abate, the film actually acquired depth and became quite touching. The final scene between Elizabeth and her father was the crown, and if an ending is what makes a movie, it makes me forgive many other mistakes.But just imagine if, instead of Keira Knightley it had Rosamunde Pike who had been doing that scene with Sutherland. It would have been near-perfection.4 stars solely because of the second half and a great attempt to take the saccharine edge off the movie-incarnations of Austen's novels.Till Noever, owlglass.com, Author: KEAEN, CONTINUITY SLIP",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's shiny, it's pretty, but it's not Jane Austen.","Although the storyline was cut down very well to fit into the time allowed for the film, this was still a poor adaptation. It left the audience feeling disconnected from the main characters - Darcy was the most approachable and that's REALLY saying something. Lizzy was remote, and while she was lively there was little to indicate her intelligence beyond her propensity to read the occasional book and sometimes express slightly more than a passing objection to some point or other. This was not necessarily the fault of Keira Knightley however as she wasn't exactly given much to work with in the first place. Mr Wickham was virtually a nonevent, as were Lydia and Kitty, and Mary to some extent too, but the most offensive aspect of the character adaptation was the portrayal of Mr Bingley as some kind of endearing fool designed to bring comic relief to the text.Jane Austen is known for her surpassing talent in character development. This film did virtually no justice to that whatsoever, and even insulted it at times. Moral of the story: if you're going to try to adapt something and make it ""easier"" to understand, at least try to do it without making a mockery of the best parts of the original.On the plus side, the cinematography was beautiful and the casting generally good, and at times it did seem a little more realistic than many period pieces, with mud and dirt and messy hair, but unfortunately this impression of realism is also partly because the makers changed the behaviour of Jane Austen's characters to seem slightly more modern and thus normal to us. It seems film makers of period drama often find it very hard to comprehend this basic fact of history: people in the past were NOT. LIKE. US. This shows in the way they often try, subtly or unsubtly, to impose modern Western values on the characters designed to exist within a totally different time frame, and it may seem reasonable to the viewer but it makes the characters less realistic in their context.I had low expectations in going to see this film. Usually this means I'm easily pleased. Unfortunately, this version of Pride and Prejudice didn't even pass my low standards. If you want better Austen productions, try Roger Michell's version of Persuasion (1995), Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility (1995), Douglas McGrath's Emma (1996), or my preferred version of Pride and Prejudice - the 1995 mini series directed by Simon Langton (not strictly comparable seeing as it's roughly five hours and the film had to fit the story into about two, but nevertheless a much better telling of the story).Or why not even go one better and try reading the book?",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cinematic wonder,"This movie is so well directed, acted and written, it is almost impossible to find fault; unless of course you are an Austenfreak who expects every character and every scene in the book to fit in an 2 hour movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent!,"While the movie took some liberties and didn't follow the book exactly, it conveyed the love story with all the heart, passion, and confusion it deserved. If you have read Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, you will greatly appreciate Knightley's Elizabeth: she captures the youthfulness and playfulness of Elizabeth much more than Jennifer Ehle's portrayal in the much beloved 1995 miniseries. And while many still consider Colin Firth the greatest Darcy to ever appear on screen, I would choose McFayden over Firth to play Darcy any day. McFayden's Darcy is more believable because we see his vulnerability, we understand how Elizabeth misunderstands him. Firth is handsome and can stare and frown with the best of them, but McFayden brings life into Darcy, and although you have to wait almost 2 hours for it, the definitive moment in his portrayal is his smile: it is incredibly cute and sincere, and it lets the audience see his softer side. Firth's Darcy never did. I have read the book approximately 13 times, so I feel I have a good viewpoint from which to critique the movie, and although there are certain scenes which I wish had been filmed in closer conjunction with the text, overall, this version brings to life Jane Austen's best work in outstanding fashion. Everyone should see this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
excellent film...not just a chick flick,"I was hesitant to see this movie at first...being a died-in-the-wool Colin Firth fan. I was convinced that the mini-series was ""the final incarnation"" of Pride and Prejudice....I was wrong. This film is beautiful in all aspects: cinematography, acting and story. It humanizes the characters and livens things up with the acting, writing, costumes and sets. It was a breath of fresh air for a classic story! I was surprised by Kiera Knightly performance. She had big shoes to fill and was excellent. It was difficult going in to think of anyone other than Colin Firth portraying Darcy, but Matthew MacFayden did an amazing job! The acting was top notch across the board. Put your prejudice aside and see this film. I can't wait to see it again! It is just simply wonderful!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautifully done,"I don't know what that other guy was talking about, this was by far the best adaptation of an Austen book, let alone Pride and Prejudice which has been done what 7 or 8 times? The cinematography is breathtaking, the characters all developed and nuanced, the costumes seemed to be more realistic, and the 18th century attitudes intact. The ensemble of this film should be very proud as well, because every scene was cohesive and masterfully acted. Keira Knightley should win the Oscar for this film, her performance was one of the best of the year for any female in film. I loved the dialogue, it stayed very true to the spirit of Austen. Having read this book twice and being very familiar with 18th century literature, I was impressed at how closely Knightley resembles Austen's Lizzie. Really, this movie was wonderfully I only wish there were more done like it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pleasant But Not Outstanding,"It was strange watching this version of Pride and Prejudice because I'd missed it at the theater and actually saw BECOMING JANE and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES before giving this version of the ""actual"" classic a try.Nothing against Keira Knightly, who is radiant in every frame and does amazing work as Elizabeth Bennett. Watch how she holds Darcy with her eyes, so that a flat and commonplace remark becomes barbed with wit and subtle criticism.Director Joe Wright does a good job with some small things -- the dancing at the assembly really has enormous energy, much more than the identical scenes in BECOMING JANE. But the larger story doesn't really hold up. Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett is really wrong -- Charles Dance was so much better in the zombie version. Mr. Bennett has to be witty and funny, not sullen and depressed. Also the guy who plays Mr. Bingley is too goofy looking. And the actress who plays his sister is too beautiful, too glamorous, and too charismatic -- you start wondering why Darcy doesn't just marry her instead of Elizabeth! The actress who plays Charlotte is great, capturing the balance between pathetic and courageous, while the guy who plays Mr. Collins is actually pretty subdued. His opposite number in the zombie version was running into furniture and falling through windows!Altogether this is a good movie, but in some ways BECOMING JANE was more poignant and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES actually had a better supporting cast!PS I'm not saying the cast here lack talent. Kitty and Lydia are played by Cary Mulligan and Jena Malone, two of the most brilliant actresses ever! It's just that Joe Wright doesn't really know what to do with them. He's better at directing big crowd scenes than actual one on one drama.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Nicely Done,"This was a rich, passionate take on a very old story, and Keira Knightley is a revelation as one of literature's first romantic heroines. Frankly, before this performance, I was not really sure whether she could act or not. It is hard to tell when an actress is starring across from a giant CGI octopus. But her range and subtlety as Lizzy in this movie bodes very well for her post-pirate chick future. There is still a bit of an anachronistic tomboy element to her performance, but it never reaches anything approaching the silliness of her characters in the various Bruckheimer blockbusters she has appeared in, and instead adds a flavor all her own to this Lizzy. And her liveliness and the arch nature of the character are nicely set off here by her ability to project a certain sweet vulnerability that helps her claim the movie and make you very much root for this well known character all over again.I fully understand the contingent complaining that this was not a ""pure"" adaptation of Jane Austin's P&P -- I in fact would agree with that. But the question would be does that fact somehow make this a bad movie, or even a bad adaptation? And the answer is emphatically no. Characters and story lines have to be abbreviated to make it into a feature film, but save perhaps one more scene that they really could have used to delve further into the Wickham character, the trimming does not hurt the core romance of the story, but rather focuses attention upon it. Nice supporting turns add humanity and humor to characters such as Mrs. Bennet and Mr. Collins, and upon a re-viewing, even Donald Sutherland did well with a lot of subtleties I missed in the first viewing. (I could, however, have done without the excessive squealing and bouncing around of the younger sisters). Most importantly the two leads, after a slow start, develop a palpable chemistry as the film picks up pace.And pick up pace it does -- this is P & P infused with dark romantic imagery, great period music, and some wonderful cinematography. Rather than a series of stage appearances, we get a passionate and highly entertaining labor of love, where the writer/director wisely decide to take their time and spend their precious minutes conveying emotion and energy rather than forcing in one more line or one more character which could leave little impact. It may not have the social nuance, and only sporadically achieves the comic flair, of Austen's book, but Jane's story never looked so good or felt so powerful before.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A total disaster, not just the miscast, but everything...","Pride and prejudice is my favorite book ever, I read it twice a year, and it always thrill me... Maybe I expected too much be I was very disappointed... Keira Knightley is quite OK, but she always keep the same expression on her face during the whole movie (pouting most of the time!), and she plays a very arrogant Lizzy. Matthew Mc Faydyen is OK too, cute and charming, but he looks like he's going to cry every second of the movie! The other characters are dumb (like Mr Bingley!) or vulgar (like Miss Bingley), or for most of them, transparent... you don't care about them... But the thing that really ruined the movie was the disrespect of the proprieties... They mattered so much to the society in this time, and are very important in the book... that's the basement of P&P... and here, they meet at night when they are in their nightdress, Bingley come into the room where Jane is lying ill, and start to talk to her... amazing to think it's in 1795 in the aristocracy...To finish, the director tried to mix Jane Austen with the Brontë Sisters, which hated Jane's writings, by the way... and it's unbelievable to see Mr Darcy and Lizzy together under the rain, he, telling I love you... Where is Heathcliff? screaming and hitting tree trunks with his head?Cant' believe that with a wonderful story, and so much money, they ruined the movie...

A highly enjoyable adaptation,"I am absolutely appalled by the fact that some people are commenting and marking this production on the basis of watching just the trailer and not even seeing the movie. That is totally unfair on everybody concerned in my opinion. The trailer is a trailer not a resume of the movie.Ttake it from me it does not do justice to the complete production.I went to see this film as a sceptic. Like many others I thought that the essence of the novel could not be condensed into 2 hours and that Kiera Knightley was a bad choice for the central role. Luckily I did not go to see it with any 1995 TV miniseries baggage. I always thought that that adaptation was far from perfect.The director and writers did a fine job in getting the essence of the story into the time available. Yes a lot is cut out, inevitably, and there are some changes to important parts of the plot but the film structure means that the essence is there. The cinematography is fantastic and, I have to admit, Kiera Knightley comes of age as an actress. Particularly good also was Rosamund Pike as Jane.One major gripe. Why give the US and Canada a film 8 minutes longer with a superior ending. Do the producers think we Europeans have a shorter attention span? I feel quite cheated by this decision.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good matches!,"Touching romance. I liked it. Then I went to watch the 1995 mini version. Shocked by the Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) in the mini series. That Mr. Darcy is stunning and unbelievable. Most charming male character ever created in movie history! However, that is also what makes me feel the Lizzy in that version is not a good enough match for Mr. Darcy. To be frank, to attract someone like Mr. Darcy, being very clever is probably not enough. She needs to be stunningly beautiful too.For this reason, I think in this 2005 version Mr. Darcy and Lizzy is a better match.Although, this version is not so faithful to the original novel and the overall performance is not as good, I still think it is a very touching story and well performed. Both Mr. Darcy and Lizzy are attractive.I think Jane in this movie is better than the Jane in the mini too. Seem reason. It is not possible to attract a handsome and rich young man at once without stunning beauty. This is the fact of life! Apparently this fact was ignored in the mini series. If Jane is not very beautiful, what else does she has to deserve Mr. Binley's immediate love? Good performance skills can't be convincing enough. So, well done, 2005 version.Not perfect of course,Lizzy smiles too much.Mr. Binley's smile was a bit silly once. And, the original dialogs and settings could be better used....However, I still voted it 9 out of 10, because I feel two better matches in this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good attempt,"Having seen the BBC version, I was expecting to be disappointed. However, I wasn't. It is really quite good - a new look at a well known drama. It ran along nicely - the sets were authentic looking. Most of these period pieces have sets that are set in some master plan somewhere. This was a cut above. I thought Keira Knightley was absolutely gorgeous. Mind you, she was so lovely that surely Mr Bingley would have gone for her, rather than her sister. Matthew MacFadyen didn't strike me as being as handsome as Colin Firth, but conveyed his awkwardness well; you really felt he didn't know how to handle women, especially sparky ones. Personally, I always want to strangle Mrs Bennet; I thought Brenda Blethyn was an improvement over Alison Steadman, who sounded like Edna Everage. Mr Collins was very good, but not as good as the previous version, who was truly excellent. I particularly liked Kelly Reilly as Caroline Bingley. She had a really bitchy feeling about her, but sexy with it. Judy Dench - please! I am completely Denched out. Dead Ringers had it right - Judy Dench plays every middle aged middle/upper class English lady who ever lived. Barbara Leigh-Hunt in the previous version was absolutely fantastic - much better than Dame Judy, I am afraid. Donald Sutherland was a mistake - was he dubbed? Just stuck in for a name, I suppose. Not as good as the BBC classic, but enjoyable just the same.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mesmorising & enchanting to watch,"This film was my very first taste of Pride & Prejudice it had a huge effect on me; I was absolutely memorised by it! I loved this film and find that it becomes even more amazing with every viewing, as I discover all the hidden details that make it so rich and enchanting. Of all the films I have seen, this has affected me like no other; I walked out the cinema feeling all warm inside and still get that feeling every time I watch it! Perhaps some fans of the 1995 mini-series will find this movie so different that they won't like it and I agree that it doesn't remain absolutely faithful to every detail of the book, but it is necessary for a film in the year 2005 to keep it fresh. It is also hard to get one book into just over two hours of film. Personally, I had no problem at all with it and didn't fell it was 'rushed' in any way. I suggest people who have read the book or seen the 1995 version watch this film with an open mind to enjoy it as a good two hours of entertainment and not to expect a chapter-by-chapter review! The casting was excellent with lead Keira Knightley providing a very strong and lively Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew MacFadyen perfectly showing Mr Darcy's struggle and vulnerability. Again I find that after buying the DVD and watching it many times that there are so many subtle looks from him that you may miss on first viewing that gives the character a new depth. Other excellent performances come from Brenda Blethyn as Mrs Bennet and Rosamund Pike, Talulah Riley, Jena Malone and Carey Mulligan as the Bennet daughters who managed to portray an excellent sense of sisterly love! Generally, I thought the casting was flawless and couldn't see many weaknesses at all with it. Perhaps one of the best things about this film is its cinematography and filming. There are epic shots of the English countryside that take your breath away and certain scenes done entirely in one shot, sweeping through the different parts of a home creating a truly unique sense of being really in the film. The script is excellent with some memorable lines and very funny moments throughout the film, mainly in scenes with Mr Collins or Mrs Bennet but surprisingly with scenes featuring Mr Darcy too, when he shows his awkward and vulnerable side that's is so sweet it's funny. The soundtrack to this film by Dario Marianelli is again one more thing that makes this film so brilliant. Just to listen to the music alone is enjoyable but with the film it adds to the atmosphere in a way that is truly amazing. I suggest that all should go and see this film and as for the matter of it being a ""girl's film"", I say to all the men out there to forget any sense of manliness for two hours and go and see it. I know that some men loved this film so it's worth a try! All-in-all, as you can all tell, I adored this film and it has been the start for my love for Jane Austen. It's one of those rare films that I can watch again and again with family or friends and enjoy it more every time. Well done to everyone involved with creating this masterpiece of a film and thank you!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great main story and aesthetics, the subplots drag it down a bit.","Despite how much I disliked the messy and contrived Atonement, I've always been a little intrigued in giving Joe Wright's Pride & Prejudice a chance. I've never read the novel, so I thought it would be an interesting introduction to the source material. Unfortunately, although I do know the premise, I struggled to follow the first half of the film, having to pause and look up the details of what was going on. However, once I got into it, I was enthralled by the complex main plot and characters, even if the excess subplots held the film back a notch. The performances are great and subtle, particularly in the two leads Knightley and Macfadyen, who's chemistry and charm are electrifying. The hyped cinematography is great for the most part, but during some of the smaller scenes, the choice to do little zooms is baffling and takes us right out of the time period, but otherwise it captures a rich and authentic atmosphere.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
I never thought anyone could outdo Colin Firth as Darcy...,"I still love the A&E version of ""Pride & Prejudice"" but this new version has much to recommend it as well. It's much earthier and, I must say, sexier than A&E's version. Matthew MacFadyen is wonderful. You could hear the women in the audience gasp whenever he came on the screen. I saw an interview with him where he said that his take on Darcy was that he was just shy. That was an interesting slant on the character, and makes him much more human and less haughty than other versions. Keira Knightly is lovely as always, and Brenda Blethyn was a hoot as Mrs. Bennet.I also thought the actor who played Mr. Wickham was much more attractive than the one in the A&E version.

Good,"Pride and Prejudice is a subtle film, with a story of exuberant lightness. Very well acclimatized, where we immerse ourselves in that time and appreciate every aspect presented in the film, such as the music, clothes, ways of expressing ourselves, the relationship between man and woman as shown in the film, the mannerisms, every culture of the time is very represented in the film. The art direction is very good, as well as the photography which is wonderful, there are scenes that I was so delighted with. The soundtrack is very well contextualized with the film. And the characters are very well represented, with dialogues very well approached. It is brilliant how love is portrayed in such a modest way, the way the characters express themselves with their eyes and say that they love without any difficulty or fear, something that does not exist today, saying something like that is rare.

"dumbed-down, hammed-up, sappy, crappy nonsense","I did not enjoy this film. Keira Knightley does not manage to portray an intelligent woman -she plays the part as a silly headstrong girl -and when required to act, she appears out of her depth and merely grins, displaying her pretty teeth. This is not acting.Darcy is a wet lettuce.Bingley appears to be aged about 13.Bingley's sister appears to be in another century. Or a different movie.The Bennett girls appear to be on amphetamines.There is no delicacy or restraint in this movie -all is OTT. There are several unbelievable, incomprehensible moments - the film opens with one -who in their right mind goes striding along in the countryside reading a book??

A transcendental experience,"This movie had me laughing, crying and feeling just everything in between. The chemistry between Matthew Macfadyen and Keira Knightley is extraordinary, more, in my opinion, than the famous Jennifer Ehrle/Colin Firth duo, parts of which I re-watched when I came home. You can feel and see this Darcy struggle with his own arrogance and then his emerging feelings. Most other Darcys have been less accessible and this one hits just the right note so you can go along with Elizabeth from feeling angry and insulted to the natural progression of her feelings as she realizes the depths of this man. It is so wonderful to see an incredibly sexy scene without any groping or clothing removal, and yet sexier than anything I've seen involving nudity. The screen fairly crackles with the undercurrent! Keira Knightley is such a delight, making us feel everything she's feeling. The supporting cast, as always in British movies, is first class. Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn are the best Bennet parents I've ever seen. A movie I will buy when it comes out on DVD and watch over and over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I really enjoyed Sense and Sensebility and now I am a new fan of Pride and Prejudice, what great stories!

When she meets a man named Mr. Darcy, she is disgusted by his arrogance and swears that she will never marry him. After seeing two of her sisters getting purposed to as well as one being married, she is feeling lonely as ever, but is very stubborn and opinionated where she will not settle.

I do not mind that it got Keira'd away!,"""Sense & Sensibility"" is a Jane Austen literary classic that has been adapted for the electronic media copious times. The story is about the Bennett family which are comprised of sisters Jane, Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty, Lydia and of course pop/mum Mr. & Mrs. Bennett. This capricious tale about how the sisters relentlessly seek future husbands could have easily been re-titled ""Sister Act"". The latest film version of ""Sense & Sensibility"" stars Keira Knightley as the jovial but practical Elizabeth. Matthew Macfadyen co-stars as the legendary Mr. Darcy, the wealthy but snobby bachelor who bumps heads and eventually hearts with the innocent Pink Lizzy herself. What made sense about ""Sense & Sensibility"" was the admirable acting of Knightley and the cool magnetism of Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennett.

A Cinematic Masterpiece,"This is one of the few films that checks every box - perfect casting, flawless cinematography, production and costume design. The direction is masterful, editing seamless and the music score is ethereal and divine.Crafted like a cinematic symphony, this film doesn't miss a beat. It never gets tired and offers new fans of Jane Austen novels a perfect introduction to her clever writing for strong female leads with many wistful moments of splendor. The restrained romance of the times makes even the simplest gestures potent and memorable.We can't say enough great things about this film. For those who are loyal to the series of the same name with Colin Firth - give this another chance. Watch it again as though you have never heard the story before. We have watched this film many times and it never gets old. We turned on the subtitles on our second time through and enjoyed it even more - the rapid-fire dialogue is perfect in timing and delivery.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Shines in performances, but not dazzling","This was my first taste into the famous novel that is 'Pride and Prejudice', so I really didn't know what to expect. I wasn't thrilled but it's definitely an enjoyable watch. Knightley is easily the best part about this movie. Dench, Sutherland, and Macfadyen also have great moments throughout. But I found the mother to be incredibly annoying and unwatchable. I wouldn't agree with the tag line of 'Greatest love story of all time' but I did like the chemistry between actors. This movie really got me thinking about how lucky I am to not have to be involved with any traditions of ""Arranged Marriage"". I cant believe what people had to go through back then. This movie is a good watch no matter. On a side note, the score/main theme of this movie constantly reminded me of the Craig Armstrong 'Love Actually' theme. Just food for thought. Anyways, I would recommend this film, as it is a very satisfying period piece. 7.2/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A great cast creates a good romance,"Mr. (Donald Sutherland) and Mrs. Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) have 5 daughters Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), Mary (Talulah Riley), Jane (Rosamund Pike), Lydia (Jena Malone), and Kitty (Carey Mulligan). They would like to marry off the daughters since the land is bound to be inherited by Bennet's cousin Mr. Collins. Wealthy bachelor Charles Bingley, his sister Caroline (Kelly Reilly) and friend Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen) are introduced at the dance. Elizabeth tries to interact with Darcy but he turns out to be rather cold. Mr. Collins comes expecting to have the eldest Jane but she's engaged. Mrs. Bennet suggests Elizabeth instead. Then there is the handsome charming Lieutenant Wickham who has an ugly tale about Darcy.There are Pride & Prejudice remakes all the time. This one is better than most. It has a great cast from top to bottom led by the beautifully feisty Keira Knightley. There isn't a weak spot in the cast. It keeps the focus on Elizabeth and her love life with more emotions. I think it's a great movie interpretation.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Cut off here, and added too much there","For a two-hour movie, It was delightful to finally see ""Pride and Prejudice"" after 10 years, but whomever fault it is, I'm not sure, but they cut off family members left right and center!!! and then added up unsuitable scenes for the period the story was lived in, it hurts to see!!! you don't have to know much to see the errors... how they sit at the table and all... Lizzie was a bit too skinny for the part, in my opinion, and they did get a very cute Mr Darcy, but poor Mr Bingley! they made him the village rich-idiot!!! and then they cut off one of his sisters+husband!!!! not good!! so Instead of having those long, boring field scenes, or making up whatever absurdity they did, they could've just sticked to the book, and it would've been a little bit better!!! Can you imagine a Lady making a a call in the middle of the night!!! and Lady Catherine de Bourg, nonetheless!!!! it was a nice movie in the overall, but the 1995 BBC mini is still top of the line, and as close as possible to the book as I've ever seen!!! but then, they had 5 hours to do it... so they might as well!!!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pride and Prejudice,"I was greatly disappointed in this version in that several elements were missing. I have seen several versions of this movie from 1)Greer Garson & Sir Lawrence Olivier,2) Colin Firth and Jennifer Erle and 3) Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul. The second and third are by far my favorites because it stayed very close to the book which I've read twice. The version with Garson and Olivier were not as close to the book but very enjoyable. I greatly respect all of Jane Austens's literature but the newest version was quite disappointing in that they made all the Bennett girls serious. Elizabeth's character is suppose to be serious, while Jane is naive but good. Keira Knightley is character was to silly as well as the mother and sisters. Although Donald Sutherland is a very good actor this truly was not the part for him. I have seen Brenda Blethyn in much better roles. I love Dame Judi Dench but not in this role.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Best Film I've seen in years,"I adored this movie. It was funny, dramatic and romantic in all the right places. I adored the book and the truth was that i was definitely hesitant to go and see a Hollywood version of this film, especially when i found out that Keira Knightly was going to play Elizabeth. I was very pleased to be wronged for once. I have nothing but praise for the actors, Keira Knightley especially. She brought to life one of my favorite characters and was so convincing that when i imagine Elizabeth i imagine Keira. Matthew MacFadyen makes an awesome Darcy, he is at least Colin Firths equal. Brenda Blythen play's Mrs Bennet to perfection and Donald Sutherland play's Elizabeth's doting, yet sarcastic father perfectly. The set was so much better than the 1995 version, the set than was immaculate but if you've ever read the book Austen describes the Bennett home as a farm. That is exactly what the set designers have done and it is amazing. All the sets are amazing and i actually liked these costumes they are better than the empire lines. The only thing i have against this film is that they type-casted Jane as a blonde, i would honestly like to know where they got the idea that Jane is a blonde. Apart from that i really adored this film and would recommend it to anyone. It is one of the best movies of 2005 and very enjoyable film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Exquisite Delight,"This is the rare 18th -19th century English romance which does not pervert the story to the slow, unendurable long shots of empty countryside. Indeed, every shot in this film serves the narrative and furthers either story or character.As others have noted, the acting is flawless; nobody here ""over- acts"" the drama to impale the viewer on the twists, turns, and meanings. Donald Sutherland especially is a subtle delight as the father of five unmarried woman and the husband of one coarse driven wife. The role of Darcy has not been, I believe, so well nuanced and delivered -- one will see him in a fresh light after this film.I need to comment on the photography and camera-work: especially in the final shot of the ballroom, there is a VERY long single take (apparently intended as a master shot to be used for establishing and group takes) which is really nicely done - through doorways, over and around dancers and partiers. But I mention that just to state that the camera angles and movements never intrude, this is not B Luhrmann's ""Moulin Rouge;"" they simply are meticulously planned and executed.I have one rankle: the color timing (at least on my recent DVD) is very oddly set. Colors are very bright, looking a bit like a ""paint by numbers"" set. It is reminiscent of Turner Televisions's coloring of old black-and-white movies (I believe Turner has dropped that odious idea).Yes, I cried with huge smiles at the end. So will you, don't pretend you won't !Upshot: Wonderful film rendition of a well-loved book.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Logical, Romantic, a love story,  But Not Very Realistic.","SpoilersI have never read the book Pride & Prejudice, but I understand it is more of a story of class distinction, then this movie. The movie centers on the Bennett family and the mother that is desperate to get her daughter married and away from a terrible life of poverty, that appears to await the single ones.The movie however proceeds to show the strength of Elizabeth Darcy in bucking the system until she gets what and who she really wants. What she wants is difficult, because the person she wants it from is from the richer side of society and has an issue with poorer people. Actually his family and all around him also have the issue.Elizabeth spurns Darcy when he proposes, She lets him know that his prejudice and his pride about the class struggle have gotten in the way of his happiness.Then he miraculously changes his ways, Giving Elizabeth and her mother what she wants.

A Good (Not Great) Adaptation,"Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice has been translated to film several times now  from Robert Leonard's 1940 ""attempt"" starring Laurence Olivier, to the 1980 and 1995 TV miniseries', and now on to a new theatrical release here. Having read the book and seen all of these adaptations, I feel I can comment objectively on what does and doesn't work with regards to director Joe Wright's newest version.Let's start with the positives. It's beautifully filmed (from gnarled old trees to stunning sunsets against old English mansions) and the cast performs well. I even liked Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods, FOYLE'S WAR TV series) and the rest of the actors. They seemed to be able to grasp the internal dynamics of their respective characters and pulled in fine performances. Keira Knightley (BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM, 2002) does a good job as Lizzie Bennett but appears upbeat far too often during a time when love and loss went hand in hand. Matthew Macfayden (WUTHERING HEIGHTS TV series) does an admirable Mr. Darcy but being up against a giant of the English acting world from a previous adaptation made his character representation a bit tougher when it came to comparisons.Now let's get into my main problem: the pacing. I usually don't mind fast-paced films, but Jane Austen's book is anything but quick (checking in at around 500 pages depending on which publisher you choose). Books of this size tend to be difficult to translate to the silver screen (or TV) because of their scope, and this was the big ""ouch"" for this film. Clocking in at 129 minutes, condensing the book in such a drastic manner meant clipping out chapters and causing a bit of confusion. The confusion comes from the lack of understanding a new viewer might have IF they've never seen any of the previous TV/movie versions or IF they've never read the novel. When Lydia runs off with ""the wrong man"" it is a vital portion of the story that is only touched on and could seem disorienting to the new Pride and Prejudice viewer. We never see what happens to Lydia in London, nor do we see the wedding and where Mr. Darcy's pressure exerts itself.Comparisons will obviously be made between this theatrical release and the 1995 miniseries (which many, including myself, feel is the penultimate adaptation of Mrs. Austen's book). Some might complain that it isn't fair to make such comparisons because one was designed for television while the other was meant for theater. I'll grant that. But with the lengthy films that've come out of Hollywood lately (Lord of the Rings, King Kong, etc.), I don't feel that this new version would've suffered in the slightest by lengthening its running time and thus adding a better sense of coherency to many of the side stories. The 1995 miniseries also had an incredible benefit in that Mr. Darcy was played by the estimable Colin Firth (SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, 1998), and it is THIS Mr. Darcy that many hold as the high standard for such work. Try putting Matthew Macfayden up against Mr. Firth and you'll see what I mean; there's just no comparing them.I did give this film a positive review because a) I liked the cinematography, and b) the acting was generally well done. But for emotional impact and excellent character portrayals look to the 1995 miniseries.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
The worst of all modern Austen adaptations,"Central to the awfulness of this film is the brainlessly carnivorous vanity of Knightly's performance as Elizabeth. Note how few shots there are of her face closely relating to anyone else's. The faces are shot separately because she is evidently impossible to act with. Too bad that Elizabeth Bennett was supposed to be wise, sensitive to other people, and not self-absorbed. Her portrayal here lacks all of these aspects.Watching the DVD extras for this film, it is apparent that Joe Wright is a sort of MTV kind of director, and this is why the film is really nothing more than a collection of overblown and syrupy tableaux. In addition, despite the manifest smugness of the screenwriter about what a good job she's done, every thing that she has added does little more than trivialize Austen's intentions, while what she has taken away leaves something that has no more depth than a bodice-ripper pulp novel.The other actors are all at least competent though more often than not misdirected into caricatures.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Don't understand harsh reviews,"I would have to strongly disagree with the negative comments of mkazmierczak, carole-wilbraham, seraph_sister and others, and although it is true that this movie has some historical accuracy problems, after all it is an adaptation to a novel, not a real life event. Such accuracy is often expected in the documentaries, however who in their right mind actually look for the inaccurate portrayal of what is already a ""made up"" story. I started my reading of the book after I saw a movie, and maybe because of that I can actually compare how well the movie represents what Jane Austen portrayed in her ""Pride and Prejudice."" Even most of the dialog is used in the movie, which I thought to be extremely pleasing. As for the actors, I think all did a great job, especially in the roles of Elizabeth, Darcy, Mr. Bennet, Mrs. Bennet and Catherine DeBorough. I would assume that this movie is more likely to be enjoyed by the female population, I have no doubt that once the DVD comes out-my male acquaintances will equally find it amusing.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Decent Movie for a Decent Book,"When it comes to movies that are created in response to a novel, Pride & Prejudice does a good job of sticking to the plot and keeping the general mood of the novel, considering the limitations of films. The acting was convincing, and I think that the movie, while maybe not a substitute for the novel, is sufficient in getting the main idea conveyed to the viewer. In my personal opinion, I didn't care for the story of Pride and Prejudice in general, and I didn't find many of the characters to be particularly enjoyable. However, while my own opinion may not favor this movie, I will say that the quality of the movie itself and the humor incorporated in it makes it a worthwhile movie to watch if its style of love story is something you would enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Same with Tom Hollander (an excellent actor in anything he's cast in) as Mr. Collins, Rosalind Pike as Jane Bennett, and Brenda Blethyn as Mrs. Bennett. Honestly the whole cast suit their roles well, which isn't always the case for historical films that often try to wedge in popular actors into roles where they don't fit, for box office reasons.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Good Storyline, Weird Pacing","My overall impression of the movie was that it was pretty slow moving throughout the film, however as the film progressed towards the end of the film, it started to really gain my attention. Likewise to the book, the first half of the story is slow moving, then picking up pace towards the second half and the ending. The ending is my personal favorite because it wraps up all of the tension that was between the two main characters. The textbook Hollywood ending works pretty well in this film along with the other marriages and relationships that certain characters undergo throughout the film. My concern with the film however, is how slow moving the first half of the movie is. The first half of the movie was hard for me to focus and understand exactly what was going on because of the simple fact that nothing really happened, just a bunch of scenes where the characters are at a ball or eating dinner at the dining room table. Overall, I believe that if the first half of the film was equally as paced as the second half and towards the end, the movie would be much more considerable in my perspective.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"The movie has got ""something"" that many other modern films lack","Jane Austen's novel PRIDE AND PREJUDICE has been brought to screen several times so far. Unfortunately, I have not seen any of the adaptations except for this one, made by Joe Wright recently. So I state clearly that I am not going to compare it to anything else but I will rather treat it as a separate work. Therefore, I went to see it not to judge if the film is consistent with the novel or if it changes the content. I went to see the film hoping that I will find some true art in a modern film of this genre. And I was not disappointed.I have to say frankly, in spite of the criticism that the movie received, that Wright's film is a pleasure to watch because it has got something artistic and at the same time realistic throughout (these two do not always go in pairs, of course). Although some scenes may seem chaotic and some of the content not particularly interesting, you get involved in watching it till the very end. It is a must to state here that PRIDE AND PREJUDICE perfectly shows the reality of the England of that time. There are a number of moments when we clearly see the lives of different people, their fears and struggles, their dreams and hopes. Mrs Bennet (Brenda Blethyn) wants her daughters to get married to rich men so that their future can be safe and stable. Such a viewpoint seems dated to us nowadays, but that's how all parents thought of their children's marriages at that time. And this plot is filled with humor in the film in order not to make the content vague and sluggish. ""Oh my goodness! Everybody behave naturally,"" which is said by Mrs Bennet at an unexpected visit of Mr Bingley and Mr Darcy. Another serious matter emphasized in the film is the clash between viewpoints of the people of different upbringing and social status. The conversation between Lady Catherine De Bourg (Judi Dench) and Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) perfectly proves that. Consider this moment... At the same time, artistic pictures are embedded in many realistic scenes, some of them may be long but they really add a wonderful atmosphere to the movie. Filmed in mystical landscape of the British Isles, the film's locations are a feast for the eyes. But there is art in foremost one significant aspect, the performances.Most of the cast do great jobs in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Young and beautiful Keira Knightley gives a reverent performance as Elizabeth. I liked her acting throughout, particularly in the moments of her conversations with Mr Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen). Tom Hollander gives a reverent performance as Mr Collins, a typical man who cares mostly for his personal image in the society. His facial expressions when dancing on a ball drove me, and the majority of audience in the cinema, to gales of laughter. Matthew Macfadyen as Mr Darcy is maybe not that great in the role but at some moments, his acting is also worth considering. The Bennet sisters are portrayed by young actresses, some of them surely do not have the experience on screen, but who particularly shine in their roles are Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet and Brenda Blethyn as his wife, Mrs Bennet, the mother of the girls. It's a must to see the scene when Mrs Bennet asks her husband to reprimand his daughter Elizabeth for refusing to accept Mr Collins' hand ""...Your mother is angry because you refused..."" And the final shot - quite unexpected but how wonderfully played. Brenda Blethyn memorably presents a panic of a mother who heads her daughters to find proper men. Consider her total change when it turns out that Lydia disappeared and is not wandering somewhere but has just got married...There is one more aspect of the film that I feel an undeniable need to discuss, the way it shows love between a man and a woman. We all know what most modern films concentrate on in this case. It is mostly based on sexual desire and on no taboo in exposing it. There are even some people who have so much got used to such a view that they cannot imagine a film which does not show any nudity or sex. And in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, there is nothing of that. However, this fact is made more paradoxical by one important issue. Almost everything in the content has to do with love between a man and a woman... yet, there is even no indication of sex. This is presented really artistically ... love having to do with safety, (sometimes, unfortunately money for some characters), dignity, honor, gentleness, and sympathy. Therefore, I may allow children to see it without fear of any harm that it could do to them. In this respect, I highly appreciate this film.Honestly speaking, I really enjoyed the film and am going to see it once again. It led me to a very nice atmosphere and I really relaxed while watching it. Surely no masterpiece, but a brilliant little cinema work of the early 21st century. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Truly beautiful.,"Starting off with Mr. Darcy; Matthew Macfadyen has definitely brought a whole new significance to the character, portraying the arrogant, socially awkward but also very dazzling leading male role. Despite his offensive pride and selfish disdain, Macfadyen shows the accessible side of Darcy, by depicting his vulnerable and fragile character behind his stiff manners. Thus, his portrayal makes his love for Elizabeth more believable. Moving on to Elizabeth Bennet; the female protagonist, is portrayed by the very successful Keira Knightley, who has many more leading female roles in the period movies such as; Anna Karenina, The Imitation Game, Atonement, The Duchess, A Dangerous Method etc., making her very experienced on the portrayal of such women. She brings out different aspects of the character while giving her the adequate sense of humor with the lively intelligence and sharp-minded wit. Her performance in the movie makes the chemistry between Elizabeth and Darcy much more affectionate. Starting off with the pride of Darcy and the prejudice of Elizabeth, the transition of abomination to ardent love is reflected so elegantly, with the shots from the rain scene, to the breathtaking sunrise, that it is impossible to resist the romance.
As for the production and direction of the movie, it is adapted perfectly. The cinematography captures the environment with such wide and spectacular frames, which makes the movie, even more, prettier with the gorgeous scenery.
All in all, Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books and the movie is beautifully made, reflecting the book accurately as the brilliant classic it is. I can easily say that the story itself, the actors and the characters have ''bewitched me body and soul and I love, I love, I love it.''",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Different but surprisingly pleasing adaptation!,"I honestly wasn't sure what to expect when I went in to see this movie. I've been a little bit of an Austen freak for many, many years so I *had* to see this movie, but I had qualms. Partly wondering what Hollywood would do to this classic, and partly wondering how Keira Knightley would carry off the role of Elizabeth. I was mildly disappointed on the first, but very much pleased on the second. To explain one, I have to explain the other so I'll do that.The *worst* part of the movie is probably the fact that much of it felt rushed. They couldn't spend time on the different parts as they needed. It seemed like they were trying to make it artistic, but to me it still felt rushed. However, it was rushed because they were not cutting out nearly as many parts as I fully expected them to, so I cannot complain too much on that. Still, although this detracted from the enjoyment of the movie, I couldn't say that was what disappointed me. As my sister (yes, we are *all* Austen freaks) said, this was an adaptation but an interesting one. It's not in the mood of the book. Pride and Prejudice is heralded as Austen's most ""sparkling"" story. Rightly so. This movie does not convey that feeling; it is more ""somber"" as my sister put it. It's a different interpretation of the story. I enjoyed this even though it slightly disappointed me.I was really impressed with Keira Knightley's portrayal of Lizzy. As I said I wasn't sure how she would do; I was afraid she would over act the part, and spoil it somewhat, but she did not by any means. Her acting was definitely the best in the film, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The character was slightly more somber than what Jane Austen has, but this was fitting for the rest of the film and done very well. She was witty, cute, and *real* for lack of a better word. I gave the movie and extra point for her.The rest of the cast was excellent too, in my opinion. Darcy and Mr. Bennet's characters were not like in the book but were nonetheless pleasing and very well acted. Matthew McFayden did a pretty fantastic job and I liked him a lot (this coming from a *former* ""only Colin"" advocate, I must admit). My only problem with his acting was that in some few parts he delivered his lines way too fast. Still as I said, he was surprisingly good. The rest of the cast did the characters straight from the book, and very well.All in all I gave this movie 8 out of 10; extra points for what I considered good acting. The way the film was ""put together"" was a slight detractment, but I still enjoyed it and would see it again by all means!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Actually pretty good except for one scene...,"This is much like the 1940s version in that it does not try to portray the characters in their time period but more through the prism of the time of the audience. The balls are more rave-like than formal; the father softened and much closer to his daughters; Mr Collins more nerdy than unctuous; Elizabeth more girlish and less worldly; the romance just happening rather than developing. The pace is a little fast - it is a bit hard to keep up but the key elements are all there. The second ball scene in particular is used to excellent effect to quickly develop the characters.Personally, I did not like Kiera Knightley's affected laugh, and I found her to be a very shallow Elizabeth - but that's just my taste. One scene, however, which nearly ruined the movie was the almost kiss in the gazebo. It was completely out of place and out of character and just very lazy scripting. It broke the illusion for me.If you want a thorough, more true to the book experience - the 1995 version can't be beat but this is a pretty good update especially for those who wouldn't normally have the patience for Austen.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful adaptation,"From acting, scenery to music score...... this movie and adaptation of beloved Jane Austen's novel is absolutely gorgeous.I particularly enjoy the adaptations - the changes where the movie slightly departs from the novel - as it is done perfectly and with a true understanding and feeling of/for the text of the novel (yes, I read the book).The two main characters have the most amazing chemistry and both the bright blue eyes of the actor playing Mr Darcy with the dark emotional depth of Elizabeth Bennett's eyes... mirror the contrast of the two characters ... they are amazingly paired. I can't really find anything to critique about the acting perhaps for 'Kitty' to be less affected as it gets annoying at some point, but the character is true to its description in the book and the character is supposed to be annoying, so well done to the actor and the movie makers. Although, I wish to have seen more of Mr. Sutherland ...Now the scenery; oh my wore, it's absolutely breath taking!And last but not least is the music. It's perfectly paired to the scenes and conveys the feeling in the most ingenious way. It makes one want to learn to play a piano.This movie is a joy to behold.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Over the Top and Overrated,"This film live up to my expectation. Awful.I knew this is going to be a disappointment and I was not wrong.This movie is total nonsense. I fully understand that an interpretation is not an exact dramatization of a book but the latest adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is just not Austen. Some people want us to understand that this is a 2 hour movie but it is not the length of the movie that is the problem here,although think Sense and Sensibility, but how the book was interpreted.It is way out there. Im not an expert but I find that some scenes are just too ridiculous. Im sorry but this movie is overrated, definitely not a masterpiece but just plain Hollywood crap.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A good movie and mostly accurate to the book,"I enjoyed watching the film. I liked the cast and the way that the book was portrayed as a movie, and I liked the sets and I thought that the clothing and way that the characters were portrayed was almost exactly as how I visited them while I was reading the book. Though I enjoyed the film, there were a few things that I didn't care for. For example, I didn't really care for how the Bennet Estate was a mess. The home gave the impression that the Bennet family were not as classy and sophisticated as they were portrayed in the book. There were animals wandering through the house and it looked like a mess to me. There were also some things regarding the relationship between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy that gave the film more of a romantic feel than the book did. Overall I enjoyed the movie, there were just a few things that strayed away from the novel that I thought were noticeable for people who have read the novel.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

One of the true classics.,"I read the book half a century ago, so I have not watched it with aggressive attention to the details that many do.

The casting was well done, every character has their role perfected.One thing that stands alone with this high budget version is the magnificence of the film. The sights and sounds of the countryside, the marvelous scenes and sets, the score, the film can absorb you completely.Watch it on a large screen and let yourself be overwhelmed.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Now that's better!,"On the whole, i think that the Harry Potter saga has been a disappointment for the fans of the books. This is now being corrected by the producers of the latest instalement to the Harry Potter series. The acting is now at above average level and the story line was much better. They managed to keep in all of the action bits and loose the bores, without damaging the main plot. Daniel Radcliffe made a good effort this time, and, as usual, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson, were their usual excellent selves. Although some of the more famous actors got a bit of the short straw, most of them were easily recognised for their performance. I wasn't impressed by the book, however the film version has made the whole story-line much clearer.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely Perfect 2 Hour Adaptation!,"While I will say first off, that no movie production ever made will ever equal a novel, especially one of this magnitude, this movie is very well done.
Jane Austen's tale of love and economics reaches us once more with the energy of a thorough novelty. ""Pride and Prejudice"" has been a favorite novel of mine since I first read it. Amazingly enough I've never been disappointed. The material seems to be full proof. Colin Firth's Darcy, in many ways, is the Darcy I've always imagined. Matthew MacFadyen was totally new to me but he managed to create that sense of longing that makes that final pay off so satisfying. Kiera Knightly is a ravishing revelation. I must confess, I didn't remotely imagine that she was capable of the powerful range she brilliantly shows here.
The photography, the art direction and the spectacular supporting cast, in particular Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn, makes this new version of a perennial classic a memorable evening at the movies.
This Pride and Prejudice adaptation perfectly captured the wit, the intelligence, the passion and the romance of Jane Austen's classic. The 1995 mini is fabulous, and I have watched it many times, but I have always been frustrated that while it got so much of the dialogue and the detail right, it somehow fell flat on some of the more subtle dynamics of the novel.
But this movie adaption has captured what has before been missing! True, it took license regarding some of the verbiage and detail of the novel, but it ultimately completely captured the characters, their transformations, their strengths, their vulnerabilities and their passions. You simply cannot do a definitive work on Pride and Prejudice in two hours. And this film doesn't try. But what it does attempt to capture the story and characters, it does beautifully. It is well acted, well directed and connects as the book connected. While it has to rush and skimp on scenes and characters, it is the most authentic and true to the spirit of the novel version that I have ever seen. You simply do not want it to end...All in all, i must give this movie 5 stars, 10 out of 10, 100 % brilliance. The story itself, the characters, the actors, everything that was in the movie 'bewitched me body and soul'. i have never been more moved by a movie, especially not one where i found it to be as hilarious as it was moving.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I didn't know what to expect since i hadn't read the novel and wasn't a fan of Victorian style movies back then so i just took a chance and watched it with my mom.

The scenery was absolutely beautiful and the soundtrack for the movie made my heart fly. The directing was marvelous and the love story has to be the best I've ever seen. First hate, then love.

Too Short,I watched this and although I loved the way Mr. Darcy was portrayed by the actor I didn't really like the way they depicted Elizabeth. Over all I thought the film missed too many scenes and it felt really rushed. KN played Elizabeth as a giddy and naive girl that made me question if she suffered of depression or anxiety instead of just a misunderstanding and having too much pride like Mr. Darcy. The BBC episodes set too high a standard for any film that followed (6 hours verses 2). Collin Firth played a very proud Mr. Darcy but he makes you fall in love with him even after all these years. I recommend watching the 1995 version over this one but overall I rate this a 7 since I love the story.,7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Miscast, Misguided, Mistaken!","This is by far one of the worst adaptations of any Jane Austen novel I've ever seen...and I've seen them all. Wait! The 1986 production of Northanger Abbey was worse and maybe the 1999 version of Mansfield Park. OK, so this is the third worst film adaptation of a Jane Austen novel I've ever seen. Miscast, misguided, and mistaken this is a film for people who have never and will never read the book, or have never and will never see the brilliant 1995 version staring Colin Firth.

Hopeless romantic,"Saw the first showing of this movie at its opening at the multiplex today. I can tell you that not only did it thoroughly please me and my daughters but fellow theater goers as well. We all applauded at the end...and I haven't done THAT in years and years! Though no film can fully capture the esteemed Austen novel in it's entirety, this was a lovely and enjoyable adaptation. The characters were excellently portrayed by all. Knightley was most indeed ""bewitching"" as Elizabeth Bennett, and the supporting cast were equally engaging. The cinematography was excellent and not once did I feel gypped out of elements of the novel. I can tell you my 14 year old daughter was captivated and beguiled by the romance of the story.

Pride goeth before the fall.,"These types of films often confound me. Romantic costume dramas are what we would call a gift film for that significant other who drove an hour to the theater with you to see the limited run of the new Godzilla film. So imagine my pleasant surprise when the picture itself was not just bearable but one of the best films I have seen this year.Fortunately, I saw Pride and Prejudice and Zombies before this flick so I was able to follow along with the story. The costumes, sets, cinematography, and acting are all simply spot on. There is no reason to make any more versions of Pride and Prejudice they have hit perfection.Really not much more to say. I teared up a bit at the end when the poor girl with only a few servants marries the rich man with dozens of servants saving her from a life of living in a house with only one parlor for fainting.Anywho. This is one of the finest costume dramas I have ""suffered"" through. I did miss the lack of zombie action, however.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fantastic Film,"This movie is so good. Everytime I watch it I have to just sit and take it in. I don't think their is anything I would critique about it honestly. I'm mesmerized by every aspect from the acting to the transitions between frames. The filming was so unique and is was enjoyable to see the similarities between the different scenes. I liked the way it was filmed through frames, almost like we are watching the events unfold with the other characters. It made the film that much more immersive and exciting to take in. Even though every aspect was wonderful, I have to say that my favorite part is the music. I get a good feeling when I hear the opening theme of the movie. It perfectly matches the vibe of the movie and compliments the events in just the right places and times. I find myself enjoying the music the most out of any element of this film. Overall, this film is insanely amazing and a perfect representation of the timeless Jane Austin novel.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Actors fit to their roles perfectly.,"I really liked the film adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The cast did a great job of acting the characters, as well as adding even more depth to them. Specifically, Elizabeth Bennet was portrayed very well. The actress showed her intelligence and her emotional depth surrounding her love story with Mr. Darcy. The two of them initially acting like they don't like each other, later on lead to finding out that they truly love each other and end up living happily ever after. It is a classic love story that turned out good for everyone in the end. Mrs. Bennet's actress also did an amazing job. It showed us truly why she cares so much about her daughters and who they are going to marry.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Accessible, child-friendly version","I watched this with my 6-year-old daughter and we had a great time, laughed a lot, mostly at the same things and found it very entertaining. It's a more frivolous, less faithful version, with little sense of the social repression of the time it's supposedly set in, and some of the incongruities are a bit difficult, but it's funny and there are some good performances (Tom Hollander's Mr Collins stood out for both of us for sheer comic value and we found ourselves rewinding his bits). It will inevitably meet with criticism from some Austen fans (of which I am one), but it has its niche; I would probably only watch it again under similar circumstances but would do so happily.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting but not very good,"I don't like this movie much. Maybe I am just too fastidious, but in my opinion, the leading actress is not beautiful enough and Mr. Darcy is not handsome enough, either. Many people might disagree with these comments I ruthlessly made about these two, but I think those who have seen the famous 1940 version of Pride and Prejudice would agree with me. The cast in the 1940 version was truly a masterpiece and very convincing. Needless to say, the cast for supporting roles were even worse in this version, especially that for Jane and Mr. Bingley.Acting is also a problem for this movie. Elizabeth lacked the natural grace and was more immature in this new version and Mr. Darcy adopted a mien of coldness both too deliberately and indifferently. And just too many photographing gimmicks in this picture, which tired me in the end.It might be a pity that I happened to have seen the older version before this new 2005 version, because the latter was completely overshadowed by the former. Moreover, Jane Austen's novel and the script in the movie accordingly were of course very witty and engaging, but unfortunately people seldom laugh twice at the same joke.The dance scene should have been the most delightful part in Jane Austen's movies, like what I saw with immeasurable pleasure in the 1997 Emma, however, in this movie, these scenes were always so noisy, crowded and confusing that hardly caused any delight. On the contrary to being beautiful, these scenes conveyed to us some kind of uneasiness, which is really disappointing.I think as a novelist, Jane Austen was very successful, otherwise how could her works be interpreted again and again in screens? But like almost all best-sellers, these novels were full of conversations that are too witty and spicy and darted forth too quickly and freely from the actors' mouths; this feature not only lessens the credibility of the whole story, but also impairs the depth and seriousness of its artistic value. Somehow what is hidden and inexpressible should eventually turn out to be the most powerful, while words, however witty or smart they are, still lack real strength.The movie had a lot of beautifully-shot moments, mostly consisting of those fabulous landscapes, which seem almost too beautiful to be real. The color in this movie was also very rich and almost splendid in some scenes. But all the merits mean nothing in a movie which is supposed to be warm and touching yet remain noisy but cold and indifferent; this alone is enough to make this movie a failure.I rate this movie 7 out of 10. mymaoyao@hotmail.com",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Far and away the worst adaptation of this book I have ever seen...,"If you have never read the book, know little of the story but the basics and have no interest or knowledge of the fashions and etiquette which existed in England during the period in which this story is set-then you could be forgiven for not feeling the outrage which I felt when I watched it and for even feeling that it was a reasonable, if patchy and slow, film. However, anyone who has read and understood the book and can appreciate the subtleties of English life at the time can only be appalled by what is a dreadful hash-up of bad casting, horrendous script writing and the most blatant dumbing-down and Americanisation of the delicate and subtle humour which makes this classic tale the much loved story that it is.Darcy is a plank, Matthew MacFadyen's attempts at stoic pride and haughty superiority simply result in his coming across as blank, boring and severely constipated. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth is flat and lacks all of the playfulness of the original character and, for some inexplicable reason she chose to play her as though she was a silly, giggling little child who takes pleasure in verbally attacking anyone she meets whom she deems her superior. All of the subtleties of Elizabeth's character, her playful wit and her ability to see the ridiculous side of others without breaking the social taboos and etiquettes of the day, have been entirely lost in an awful rendition by Miss Knightley.The actors and actresses used for many of the other parts are far too shiny and attractive for their purpose (the entire basis of Mr Collins is that he is a disgusting, embarrassing man who no one would ever want to marry and yet they use an actor who, though he does a tolerable job of acting the piece, is actually quite attractive and would have been quite a catch!) and they actually seem to have completely omitted Mr and Mrs Hurst giving Caroline Bingley no one but Darcy to fire her nasty observations regarding Elizabeth at. Whoever thought of casting Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennett should have been shot-he plays it as he plays every character he has ever played in his life, and completely loses all grasp on the role as the film goes on. Don't get me wrong, I love Donald Sutherland-but Mr Bennett he is not. After all, you wouldn't cast Dawn French as Elizabeth would you? Vin Diesel as Heathcliffe? Danny DeVito as James Bond? This casting was just as ridiculous.Casting aside, there have been changes made to the story which are inexplicable, unnecessary and detrimental to the viewers' understanding of the film. The two changes which made me most annoyed were first, that for some incomprehensible reason Lady Catherine's visit to Elizabeth at Longbourne is made in the middle of the night! And their conversation is had in full view of the rest of the Bennett family who are standing around in their nightwear watching the scene progress! Not only would no visitor have been admitted to the house at that late hour, but no woman of any social standing would commit such a flagrant breach of etiquette for fear of losing face and no family would ever have been seen by visitors whilst wearing their nightgowns unless someone was, literally, dying! Second, Darcy's proposal to Elizabeth was made at night, alone with both 'again' wearing their nightclothes-an offence which would be unpardonable at that time and would certainly result in the lady's being shunned by society and becoming un-marryable and the man would also likely lose much of his previous social rank.Generally though, this film omits such large portions of the storyline as to provide the viewer with no basis for either Pride or Prejudice and therefore no understanding of the basic premise of the entire story can be had. If you have never read the book, you would never be able to gain an understanding of the story from this terrible excuse for an adaptation.Never before have I encountered a film adaptation which made me genuinely angry and the makers should be ashamed of themselves for butchering such a wonderful story in a blatant attempt at adapting it for an (sorry, it has to be said) American market. For gods sake, and for the sake of your own sanity-if you have read and loved the book as I have do NOT watch this dreadful travesty of a film. The Colin Firth version had its issues, but at least it tried so I'll take that any day over this piece of twaddle...",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

This version, however, made me appreciate the book all over again and in a completely different way. The cinematography was beautiful and the acting delightful. Though this version was relatively short and left out some amusing details, it was emotionally intense and managed to convey the ""spirit"" of the book throughout the entire movie. The settings, the lighting... I just loved it.

"Delicate, moving, with a much-needed touch of comedy","This is, was, and will always be THE film that irreversibly attached me to historical dramas. The costume, set, music, chemistry between the characters, the characters themselves, and the story all contributed to a visually stunning and moving adaptation of the novel. Firstly: the costume. If you are going to do a costume drama, you've got to make great costumes, and this one particular section of production I have always been personally very critical about, but I must say, these costumes were amazing, however I did notice that they replicated the fashion of the 1820s rather than the 1810s, which was when the book was set (1813). 9/10 Secondly: the set. In every scene in the film, the set was well-thought out and was appropriate. 10/10 Thirdly: the music in this film was beautiful, and very well-researched in context to the time! 10/10 Fourthly: the chemistry. The relationship between the protagonist Elizabeth and her love interest Mr (Fitzwilliam) Darcy is slowly building and extremely believable, and will take the viewer on a dramatic emotional journey from start to finish. Finally: The characters. Matthew Macfadyen's interpretation of the character Mr Darcy is rather different to other actors' interpretation. He shows a more vulnerable, though less proud but more likable Darcy, and so in this case, his relationship with Elizabeth makes more sense. Knightley didn't bring anything new to the character, and neither did she view the character in a different way, but it is safe to say her acting was good and convincing in this adaptation, although I do believe Macfadyen's performance supported hers well, and it was his that made the whole film, so in that case, I give this film a well-deserved 9/10!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Roman Osin's Sumptous Cinematography!,"While this film has many reasons to deserve a 10 rating, except for a bit of story compression at the end, it's really Roman Osin's stunning cinematography that makes it shine. This is possibly the most beautifully and skillfully shot and edited film I've seen since maybe the original Blade Runner.It's not just beautiful sets, shots and framing. Watch how the movement of the camera informs the introduction of their house, each family member and Lizzie's place within it. Watch how it follows the evolution of the character's relationships at home, at the dance and in her dreams.A couple shots need to be mentioned:1. When everyone is enjoying the dance and we follow her as she hides outside in the moonlight. She literally looks like a painting.2. Instead of a boring A/B/A/B switch, the A/B cuts are under the covers while she talks with her older sister.3. The camera shows social engagement, disengagement and awkwardness as a natural progression of the dance.4. As Lizzie walks through the various rooms at the dance, various important characters cross her path either directly or covertly.5. There is a shot / edit where Lizzie is getting dressed before the ball. At the end she blows into a feather, like she's blowing a match out, but it then cuts to a decorative fire outside the ball. This is reminiscent of the famous blowing out the match cut in Lawrence of Arabia.6. Another scene in which Mr. Darcy rides off quickly through the woods is fantastic -- like he's riding through a dark looking glass.7. Another shot where she falls asleep and while she's dreaming flickering images of the woods and of sunlight filter through her mind. Absolutely beautiful.8. Numerous other shots where you see her in various dramatic backgrounds need to be seen to be believed.This is mastery at its height and Roman Osin only got a nomination by the European Film Academy. I know that's not why we do this, but I can't imagine what would beat this.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Aloofness and Arrogance recipe for misunderstanding.,I think I read this as a teenager as an English assignment.

Mr Darcy has had some bad experiences and he brings them to the for when he judges the girls family. Elizabeth is quick to misjudge Mr Darcy without giving him a chance to explain himself.They don't speak openly to eac.h other and nearly miss the chance to be together when they realize that they have deeper feelings for each other.

Not worth the wait,"I admit to a slight bias, having watched the 1995 version and loving it. But then, I've watched several versions of the same movie before, i.e. Emma, and Jane Eyre, and liked them all. My main concern with this movie was the length. How would the makers be true to the book, and still fit it into a shorter feature? I wanted to watch it, if for no other reason than to find out.I think the only redeeming quality that I found in the entire movie was that the actors were about the same ages as the characters that they portrayed, unlike the 1995 version.I didn't care for Matthew McFayden's Mr. Darcy. I thought he spoke too fast and was unconvincing. While I am sure he's a wonderful actor, I don't think this was a good part for him. Kiera Knightly didn't spark as Lizzie, her portrayal was a bit lifeless. I didn't even want them to get together in the end.The makers glossed over so many parts, probably to fit it into the shorter time frame, that I really felt shortchanged by this particular version. Even Judi Dench, and Donald Sutherland (both actors that I love to watch) couldn't hold this movie up, since they're parts were too small to make an impact.I would, however, recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't read the book.

The vivid greens and warm yellow sunlight never fails to completely enchant me, coupled with Knightley's effervescent performance, it's just so close to perfection.I am a stickler for an English film, perhaps even more so for a period English film, so Pride and Prejudice just gets me every time. The settings always amaze me and the director has done a sublime job at really engrossing you into the scenes.For a film with such a steady pace, Pride and Prejudice never feels boring. Never too slow or monotonous. It feels as if you're part of this dreamy world, gliding through with the characters, who all contribute to the general feel in their own unique ways. Knightley is just great, it is wonderful to see her character's relationship grow and flower with Mr. Darcy.The score is also just impeccable.

Just what it is ought to be,"I adore Jane Austen's novel, so I went to see the movie with a little skepticism, convinced that it would be a weak attempt to retell a great story. I was, however, surprised by the fact that the film followed the book almost precisely - there were no big lapses in the story and no annoying elements, added by the director. Keira Knightley gives a very good performance, presenting Elizabeth exactly as I imagine her, and the other actors surely succeed to create an atmosphere almost the same as the one Austen has created. Applause also for Judy Dench, who is perfect for the role of Lady Catherine De Bourg. What I consider to be the flaw of the movie, is the little attention given to Jane and Bingley's relationship, which is certainly not as important as the one of Lizy and Darcy, but really deserves a little more. Basically, if you are a fen of the novel, you'll get what you want from the movie. And if you just want a witty romantic story, you won't be disappointed either. 8/10 for this one!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent Film,This film is refreshing it brings life into the book. Previous BBC adaptations were good but they lack the emotions of Kierra's fine performance you really believe these people are falling in love. Collins is great too. I was very surprised by how good it was I expected it to not come up to the standard of the BBC version. The way that the film deals with the time element of what took the BBC some 8 hours to achieve were well managed with intense scenes being inter-spaced with visual clues to show the passage of time or to move the plot between the key scenes. Photography was magnificent with the early morning mist in the final scene allowing the focus to be on the actors and not the scenery.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I watch this to relive a whimsical time,"I screamed in my head and held onto my heart when Mr. Darcy confessed to Lizzy in this movie. I watched other versions, but this one really turned me into a teenager fan girl. I keep imagining myself living in such an idyllic time meeting such a noble who would look at me with his eyes and say ""surely, you know, everything I did was for you"". Haha, well, I'm too honest.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Decent,"The movie was good, it just wasn't how I pictured the characters when I read the book. I don't think it accurately represents the source material, in the Pride and Prejudice novel it always felt like a puppet show of sorts, where the characters were just caricatures of people Jane Austen knew. The characters always felt muted in the novel like painted in watercolor pastels, which was true to the style of the time period in which it was written. However, in the movie the characters were so vibrant and human, it was so realistic it did not do justice to the reserved book. I know they had to do it this way because the movie was unable to narrate all the characters life like Austen did so it had to speed up the action and make it less reserved. I guess the problem is the movie lacked the elegance of the book but made the characters easier to relate to and picture. Overall, the movie is beautiful on its own just do not read the book first.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent acting and art,"I didn't even expect to like this movie except for Austin's great story and dialogue, but it was really well done. I removed one star for minor faults, like abrupt ending and Donald Sutherland's painfully white teeth, but otherwise this is one of my favorite movies.I didn't particularly enjoy the BBC version from 1995 because the acting was rigid and insipid, and conversation style unnatural - truer to the book, for sure, but that greatly reduced my enjoyment. This movie softens it all a bit to a version that feels more human and that enabled the actors to do a better job.Keira Knightley is very good in portraying Elizabeth as a lively, fun-loving, no-nonsense young woman. In the book, Elizabeth says for herself that she's often at the edge of socially acceptable (even if in a smart rather than stupid ways like her younger sisters) and Knightly does it better than Ehle in 1995 series, who just keeps a vague smile almost all the time and barely changes her expression.MacFadyen sacrifices a bit of Darcy's cold aloofness in favor of showing more of his warm side, and that was fine with me. He does excellent job of expressing strong emotions in subtle, non-verbal ways.The scenery, music and photography were excellent. There is a little detail that I only noticed when watching the movie the second time: when Elizabeth is walking through the statues in Darcy's home, there is a bust of Darcy in the background which almost seems to follow her with its eyes. Nicely done.The scene in which Charlotte explains her decision to marry Collins is touching and really brings forward the restricted, cruel position of women in the past, which otherwise is taken for granted in the book and most video versions.All in all, this is a warm and enjoyable movie full of life.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great Story,"Overall I enjoyed the movie. For the most part, I thought the movie portrayed the book accurately. However, when it comes to the Mr. And Mrs. Bennet, I felt the movie did not portray their relationship as the book does. In the novel, Mr. And Mrs. Bennet are written to be comfortable with each other, but not happy with each other. The novel makes the relationship feel like they are only together for the little money they have compared to the other characters in the novel, and for their daughters. In the film, this unhappiness is not shown much at all. Mr. Bennet can be shown to come off as annoyed with his family but never was Mr. Bennet shown to have any issues with his wife Mrs. Bennet.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Interesting though not flawless effort,"The latest version of P&P delights one with its cinematography and beautiful cast but is not without its inherent flaws. I have loved the book for many years now and so I cannot wholeheartedly consent that this is the vision Jane Austen (JA) had, especially since many people will try to take a shortcut to learning what the book is about through the visual medium . It is therefore imperative to give warning that this is not what she or her book is about in totality. I do not doubt the casting, for JA does not give minutest portrayal of looks beyond tall or short ,pretty or simple, fat or thin etc. SO one may take liberties for want of better information (with the exception of Mr. Collins who is much too short to suit the book and perhaps his clumsiness on the floor has been downplayed because of it. Being short he is easily ignored but because he is in reality/fiction a tall man he is very obviously absurdhence the director loses the physical advantage at the very outset) Mr. Darcy and Mrs. Bennet are much too apologetic of and euphemise their character flaws when they are quite the essence of the storya Mr. Darcy who is just reserved and taciturn would not suit the title at all. In all other ways he is quite apt though. There is no need to explain her mercenary attitude towards her daughters, the idea is both amusing and practical and an intelligent audience would be able to appreciate both angles. But she is seen explaining her rationale and her methods and thinking which is unnecessary and goes against her character and takes away from her absurdity which is a pity. I liked the openly vivacious portrayal of Lizzy but sans the blatant rudeness towards her mother. It is not only not a part of Elizabeth's sweet temperament and her respect for her mother at least as a parent but also quite a useless weapon in the face of her mother's total disregard of anything sensible and subtle. Also Lizzy would not have been so affected by Mr. Darcy's criticism of her looks. She would have sooner laughed at his absurd directness and superior scorn in such a sensitive matter. Here she looks hurt and takes revengenot a trait in Elizabeth. But the scenes delight all the same. Just know that is not what the book says. What is most preposterous, presumptuous, outrageous and basically unacceptable is the total lack of respect for the sort of language that would have been prevalent in that period. There is simply no excuse for this liberty since it does not find its place in the movie even. A totally miscalculated attempt at some very crass humour. I can't imagine anyone finding it funny even if they are not familiar with the lines of the book. It is too anachronistic to evoke anything but disgust. Also unnecessary was the interchange of dialogues between characters. A good writer has ample reason for choosing her characters to say certain dialogues. It is mostly in keeping with the character. Using the same for keeping everyone in the scene in conversation is hardly good direction. On the plus side the confrontations between the leads are interesting and passionate though like everyone else I am disappointed with the way it ends. It all seem to fizzle out as it reaches the climaxlike all other elements in life? It was heartwarming to see the portrayal of Mary's relative insignificance in the household affairs, Lydia's frank and uncensored manners and conversations, Kitty's impressionable and sensitive airs. But of all the sisters, perhaps even better than Keira Knightley's Lizzy, Jane is best and most honestly portrayed. She is pretty, sweet, gentle, unassuming, friendly but reserved and sedate at all times and yet never dull. She expressed much through her eyes and is in all senses very satisfying. I could not find anything wanting in her character depiction. Of course the same cannot be said of Mr. Bingley who seems to attempt to equal Mr. Collins in silliness. It is amusing to start with but Mr. Bingley is not absurd or silly he is simply modest and easily persuaded. That is not a crime or a flaw that repulses. One is not repulsed by Bingley here but you know better than to think a Jane, as we have here, would be interested in such a Bingley.So all in all it is far from a masterpiece but it is a good collective effort without his base completely in the book. It would have been better for someone with years of reflection on the book to have directed than someone who read it superficially. The book has stood the test of time for 200 plus years it is not to be unraveled over one reading!!An ardent admirer of Pride and Prejudice",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mr. Pride and Mrs. Prejudice,"Really, the book is very close to the movie. If you've read the book, then you've seen the movie. That statement is really both a blessing and a curse. It's awesome that the producers took the settings and costumes into special detail. Reading Austen's description of Darcy and Bingley's extravagance doesn't compare to seeing their mansions on the screen. The way the producers portray all the characters are very impressive as well. On the other hand, if you don't like Austen's writing style, with her long sentences and wordy descriptions, this movie is definitely not for you. When using the script, the writers took the long wordy dialogue from Austen's writing straight from the book. Many times throughout the movie, the actors would just say complete gobblygook that I would not understand. Overall, the movie is impressively made, but if you don't enjoy Austen's writing style, then you'll have trouble following.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
What period is this supposed to be in?,"I have seen photos of the movie, this newest one. I give it low points because of the utter lack of regard for it's period costumes. This is NOT Regency England! Jane Austen would not be amused... This reminds me laughingly of the MGM version of P&P that starred Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier, so this is 2 for 2 of film companies getting Regancy England so terribly wrong!I am sure that the acting is marvelous; the cast is stellar, but the lack of true Regency period infuriates me! Too many times glitz and kitch take over and surroundings suffer because of it.Others have taken Jane Austen and made it true. Take Emma Thompson, for instance. She got her characters, surroundings, and costumes just right. Filmdom could take a lesson from Miss Thompson's Sense and Sensibility, as well as TV's Pride and Prejudice that starred Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, and Persuasion with Amanda Root as Anne Elliot.All in all, I think one will prefer the 1995 television mini-series version, with it's complete story, costuming, and more of a true vision of that time. Television, when it takes on Jane Austen, seems to know who to do it right.Pity, I was hoping for more from this newest film adaptation.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

At a party, the second-born sister Elizabeth meets a rich man, Mr Darcy.In this movie Elizabeth has a strong prejudice against Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy is so arrogant, but Mr. Darcy is attracted to Elizabeth. His hand expression expresses the feeling so well.Before Mr. Darcy proposes to Elizabeth, they hate each other and talk abuse about each other. However, they are definitely attracted to each other, there are no favorable lines but their facial expression and eyelines reveal it.

We went thoroughly through the book and picked out important parts that showed the main themes of the novel. I think the movie encompassed the important parts of the novel while also staying on path with the story line. I do believe that the movie producers went along with the romance part more, rather than Jane Austen's view points that show up in the book.

"Not My Cup of Tea, But a Satisfying Ending Nonetheless","Darcy and Elizabeth's character arcs were, without a doubt, impressive. The scene between them in the field as the sun sets was like a perfect postcard-utterly pleasing and heartfelt. I was actually taken aback that they didn't end up kissing. It was a bold choice by the director, and honestly, it added a unique touch to the moment.The love story was sweet, but this particular romance sub-genre, where all the young women in the same house are obsessed with marrying high-status men while seemingly having nothing else to focus on, feels a bit out of place to me personally. My bad; I forgot it's set in the late 18th/early 19th century. For its era, it's well-executed, but with today's values in mind, it's just not my cup of tea. I had unrealistic expectations that the characters would embody modern values and women's empowerment, which was perhaps a bit misguided.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A film with the humorous spirit of Austen if not the exact accuracy of her book,"I sincerely believe that it's a little gem of cinema.First of all by its magnificent natural setting, the locations are carefully respected and chosen and this is reinforced by a wardrobe that indicates the colors of the characters.The soundtrack can only contribute favorably to the telling of the story (seductive and charming)
What's interesting here is the intelligence of an accomplished script and storyboard, whether it's the tracking shots cameras or the tone of the scenes (lines mostly).Indeed, I risk alienating the fans of the book and the miniseries of the 90's.However, I have a good reason to make my point. Joe Wright has cleverly chosen the relevant lines of the book taking into account the length of a film, reformulating key humorous lines wisely without countering Jane's spirit. (I mean who won't laugh at the iconic line of Mr Colins's boiled potatoes)
I think that's what makes a good modern cinematographic adaptation.Another small downside is Darcy's slightly more reserved character. However, let's not forget that this is a true 18th century feminine and feminist vision of the character of Darcy, which may explain his character with a more subtle than theatrical look that differs from the series. (It's probably the actor's choice, and it's really relevant to me; I was seduced by Matthew's Darcy)
the humor and quick-wittedness that Keira brings to Elizabeth is breathtaking. The main actors as well as the secondary actors have been able to bring the characters to life in such a natural way that we forget that it is only a role-playing game.And That's what I call knowing how to play.Sorry for my bad English!

Pretty and Trite,"This is pride and prejudice light. Kierra Knightly is pleasant but not up to the task. The new Darcy is actually fairly good in his part. You can understand that he loves her. Southerlan's part as father was rewritten to be more bland.The original was a treatise on marriage and the many reasons for it in her day. Daddy married for lust and does not repect her mother. Her best friend marries for practicality and is materially content and spends a lot of time encouraging her husband to do tasks that would remove him from her. Her sister Lydia marries because her husband has a taste for young girls and he was bribed to marry her despoiled bride, but she does not understand he was bribed into it. Her sister and Bingly are both in love but influenced by others. She has the perfect marriage to a man Elizabeth loves who loves her and neither care about the opinions of others.In this version the point is that they have a romance and marry which is of course dumbed down to sell.

Then don't have everyone's hair in Afro mode or glued to their face with sweat or grease! Looked like an episode of Trailer park Boys playing dress up - come on- pigs running through the house??? The house looked like a pigsty, no wonder they made a beeline for it. Who did the dark, dusty, depressing interior design - Lily Munster? But at least she was funny even for a vampire - not 'a jot' of humor was found in this sad sack version. But the final kick in the teeth was the last scene where dizzy is fondlling Darcy's naked leg.

Serene open field in sunset, Bennet's cottage life, graceful Pemberley estate, lively and festive balls, people in costumes and hair.. These are all the images I pictured when reading Pride and Prejudice, and the movie realize them on the screen more exquisite than what I hoped for.Most importantly, 'Pride & Prejudice' is epitome of romance movies.

The casting in the movie was spectacular and showed the standard of beauty for that era. The slow burn between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet kept me engaged in the movie the whole time. In saying that it does not mean that the other storylines with the other Bennet sister's are boring but they did not hold my attention as well as Elizabeth's did.

There was some humour in this movie which made it more light hearted and warming.Brenda Blethyn who played Mrs Bennet was very good, as well as Donald Sotherland who played Mr Bennet.

Good classic,"In keeping the two leads within touching distance from each other, not quite getting what the other is about, there is a sense of urgency -- we want them to make it into each other's arms, even if it happens in the last page (or the last scene, this being film). This being one of the most well-constructed novels of romance and one who gains more weight with every passing decade, it has also embedded itself into modern culture. It wouldn't be hard to find references of this type of story in SEX AND THE CITY, for example, in which Carrie Bradshaw and Mr. Big, two polar opposites, meet, fall for each other, then argue, then get separated, meet again, can't get along, can't understand each other, go on their separate ways until Mr. Big undergoes such a change towards the end of the series run that when he comes for her, we absolutely believe it and want him to rush after her, snatch her up, and bring her back home where she belongs.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

"If you love Jane Austen, her humor is lost in this version","Sadly, this movie did not live up to my expectations (which I must admit are low, as I own the 1995 BBC version of Mansfield Park). At least in Mansfield Park, they didn't change the intent of the humor and flavor of Jane Austen, it was only poorly cast. In this version of Pride and Prejudice, the Bennett family was not portrayed in the proper social class; Darcy and Elizabeth would have never met. Darcy would have never fallen for such a low class family. The scenery was exquisite, however it alone could not hold my attention. I couldn't look at Donald Sutherland and not ask myself, ""What the heck is he doing in this film?"" If you're a Jane Austen fan, I give this movie two thumbs down.

"Yes, sorry, this IS an amazing film","I bet this movie has become one of those love to hate films by now, lost under the weight of Mathew Macfadyen's starry eyed fandom (don't get me wrong here, I think he's a brilliant actor and gorgeous to boot but this isn't just about the brilliant M&M). Pride & Prejudice 2005 is still near the top of my favourite things list (like THINGS list, not just my favourite movies list.) I'd say it strikes the perfect balance between the original text and a contemporary telling. The chemistry among all the actors, particularly between the two leads, makes the movie a joy to watch. The cinematography is ingenious and gorgeous. The costumes are simply lovely to look at and the messy hair is a refreshing modern take. The only sour note for me is Donald Sutherland's teeth. Couldn't something have been done to make them less creepily perfect? This is England in the19th century folks.

"The film perfectly preserves the essence of its original work, building a narrative that transports the plot's content efficiently, maintaining the book's characteristics","Adaptation of Jane Austen's iconic novel, Pride and Prejudice perfectly preserves the essence of its original work, building a narrative that transports the plot's content efficiently, while maintaining the book's characteristic freshness and atmosphere; which leads to a harmonious orchestration of form and content that establishes what can be treated as exemplary in a film adaptation.Scripted by Deborah Moggach (with uncredited assistance from actress Emma Thompson), the film follows the encounters and mismatches of one of literature's most famous couples, the vivacious Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) and the taciturn Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen). Mother of five daughters to a not-so-well-to-do couple, Elizabeth is a smart, irreverent young woman who takes an almost immediate dislike to the wealthy but boorish Fitzwilliam Darcy, who doesn't seem too impressed with the girl either. However, as they are the protagonists of an iconic romance, it is not long before the two begin to change their minds about each other.The first version of Pride and Prejudice taken to the screen's dates from 1938. Since then, there have been more than a dozen works based on this same text - it is the most popular of all written by Austen. So, what's the difference with this version? Perhaps the technical rigor, reflected in Oscar nominations in the categories of Art Direction, Costume Design and Soundtrack, for example. But it is likely that the best is in the safe hand of Wright, who after some work on television makes it to cinema in an auspicious way. He manages to set the right pace for the plot, without overdoing the melodrama or slipping into the caricature. The filmmaker also avoids exaggerations common to the genre, such as dazzling the scenery, reflecting the time set, or too many flourishes that place - and annoy - the spectator in a historical condition that is of little interest to those concerned only with the unfolding of events.The first sequence of Pride and Prejudice makes clear much of the dynamics of the film and the personalities of the members of the Bennet family. Elizabeth (nicknamed Lizzy) is alone reading a book and enters her upper-middle-class home, one of her sisters is playing the piano, two others are running around laughing, and their parents are talking about the arrival of a rich, single man. In the city. Wright's camera is able to explore this set of diverse suggestions about each character: Jane is presented in isolation, as a more contemplative and distinct figure from her environment; Mary, who barely appears throughout the entire film, but according to the book is more reclusive and less frivolous, is captured only from the back; the other two sisters represent the archetype of a kind of jovial futility, always and only concerned with men and their riches; as well as the matriarch of the Bennet family, who treats her daughters as business to be worked on in connection with marriage.All this is presented at once in a few minutes. Lizzy, it is suggested, is the only character who has ""something to say""; and although Mary and her older sister, Jane, also do not fit the pattern of futility just pointed out, it is only Lizzy, within that family, who has a load of subjectivism to be explored. The young woman is firm in that elite environment, showered with dances and dinners, as a singular figure, with fine irony and quick responses that are plucked out in the dialogues. The script builds a beautiful work on the lines present here, maintaining the archaic tone of the words without making them boring by filling them with irony and wit. Thus, sometimes we have stripped dialogues full of sarcasm, sometimes we see others that are more sentimental and soulful - mainly those of the encounters between Lizzy and Mr. Darcy in the second half of the film.This fixed presence of Lizzy is not marked by an incessant search for a certain female empowerment, but in a subtle way, which is articulated not only by the script and direction, but also by her performance. Keira Knightley, who portrays her, possesses a meek aspect that articulates a bold persona in an angelic way, creating a performance that captivates the viewer's eye and awakens our affection for her. Knightley manages to be sweet without sounding overly sappy, and confronts the conventions of her time without resorting to a tough stance that comes off as grumpy. She is a character/interpretation that is modern enough to be disruptive and, in equal measure, classic enough to exude femininity. Regarding the construction of his romantic partner, there is the presence of Mr. Darcy, played by Matthew Macfadyen, who also plays his role with competence. This one is far from having the same charisma as Knightley and, for that very reason, is successful. It is precisely from the somewhat grouchy tone manifested that his character is established, having, at first, aroused Lizzy's disgust. However, it is through these protests coming from the girl that the film turns around, developing the couple's romance.Vulgarized by its exhaustive use in romantic comedies, the narrative resource of the ""couple who seem to hate each other, but who really love each other"" finds, here, one of its most effective examples: contrary to what happens in the nonsense usually produced by Hollywood, which includes unconvincing quarrels between their future lovers, Darcy and Lizzie seem to really dislike each other, and with very specific reasons: she thinks he is pedantic and rude; he considers her unsophisticated and reproaches her family's lack of etiquette. Thus, as we are convinced that the couple cannot tolerate each other - but, at the same time, we know that they should be together -, the story becomes more interesting and fun. Furthermore, despite the plot including its share of misunderstandings and mismatches, the characters are not hiding important information from each other, which usually sounds artificial, like a script maneuver to prolong the story: when the protagonist is informed of certain Darcy's attitudes, for example, she demands explanations from him at the first opportunity that presents itself. One of the title ideas for Jane Austen's novel was First Impressions, the meaning of which I have just described. The title, however, ended up being Pride and Prejudice, and here we see these two feelings as a dialectic in the couple's romance: Lizzy represents the prejudice with which she sees Darcy, and this is the pride with which she views Lizzy. These two first impressions will be imposed by the audacity in the personality of one and the coldness in the personality of the other. The film, then, more than a simple novel, is a story about moral, social and sentimental issues that go together without the possibility of being separated.Despite being new to the role, director Joe Wright demonstrates an undeniable talent in leading the story in a delicate way, providing us with comic elements and a great pace of narration, with the characters being built throughout the story. Throughout the projection, the director presents the viewer with long and elaborate long shots in which his camera wanders through the large ballrooms of British high society, ""casually"" encountering various characters as if we were eavesdropping on their conversations. On the other hand, by including a moment in which the main couple sees themselves dancing alone in the ballroom, such is the interest they have in each other, the resource proves to be obvious and beaten, having already been used to exhaustion (and in a much more convincing way).) by other productions. Even so, Wright once again earns points for the various moments of humor that run through the narrative, such as Mrs. Bennet and the daughters with the unexpected arrival of a possible suitor, when the women break into a mad dash to assume more elegant positions before visitors enter the room. To top it off, Roman Osin's cinematography exploits Panavision's beauty to the fullest, revealing evocative, misty landscapes and lending the film, with its elegant lighting, a suitably nostalgic, period tone - and it's unfortunate that it wasn't nominated for the Oscar (it could perfectly take the place of Brokeback Mountain, for example).The only defect found in the film is the way in which Jane's romance with Mr. Bingley, in which the slightest development between them is not presented, causing the episode in which she spends at his house when she is sick to be exposed in an abrupt and displaced way from the plot - here, the script ended up subtracting more than it should from the book content. It should also be noted that the figure of Mr. Bingley has been reduced to a mere caricature of a goofy fellow completely incapable of expressing himself. But none of these factors overshadow the strength of this adaptation full of tenderness and delicacy, which manages to paint an accurate portrait of an era without taking away the protagonist around the feelings of its characters.In the end, don't be fooled by appearances: ""Pride and Prejudice"" may have pomp and circumstance, but it's nothing more than a nice romantic comedy, like so many others that hit the screens all the time. If it manages to stand out, it is due to other factors in the set, in addition to the argument itself. And these, pleasantly, fulfill their role satisfactorily. Even more enriched by the well-constructed dialogues, ""Pride & Prejudice"" only fails to extend a little longer than ideal, since, as the viewer knows how the story will end, the aura of inevitability of this conclusion makes the experience relatively predictable. But the journey to the end is, without a doubt, full of charm.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful novel equal beautifully crafted in film!!,"Pride & Prejudice is a 2005 romantic drama film directed by Joe Wright, in his feature directorial debut, and based on Late Jane Austen's 1813 novel of the same name.The film stars Keira Knightley, Matthew Macfadyen, Brenda Blethyn, Donald Sutherland, Tom Hollander, Rosamund Pike, Judi Dench, Rupert Friend and Simon Woods.A beautiful novel made into a equally beautiful film, the film is not only stunningly beautiful but also amazingly acted and the characters wo were chosen were just great and perfect for their respective characters. The film is also backed by equally beautiful cinematography.The screenplay of the film is great and the film will keep you glued to the screen, the locations and costume looked perfect for the film but in my honest opinion it seems that the film could've been little more lengthy in terms of screenplay and the film would've been ended in a much better way.Acting is superb and as mentioned earlier and all the actors were aptly perfect for their roles and none of them will disappoint.

A sumptuous period piece,"It's a romantic costume drama set in early 19th-century rural England. It follows a modestly well-off family with five marriageable daughters. It mainly follows the romantic lives of the two oldest daughters.Mr. Bennett (Donald Sutherland) is an older gentleman married 20 years to a somewhat younger Mrs. Bennett (Brenda Blethyn). She is erratic and loquacious, focused entirely on finding suitable financially stable husbands for their daughters because the family property must go to a male heir, currently a pompous young minister, Mr. Collins (Tom Hollander).Jane (Rosamund Pike) is the oldest daughter, attractive and optimistic but passive in spirit. Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) is also lovely, spirited, intelligent, and gifted with a quick tongue. Mary (Talulah Riley) is not outgoing. Kitty (Carey Mulligan) is practically invisible. Lydia (Jena Malone) is flirtatious and lacks judgment.A wealthy member of the upper class, Charles Bingley (Simon Woods), rents the estate next door with his sister Caroline (Kelly Reilly) and best friend, Mr. Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen). Mr. Darcy's aunt is an insufferable upper-class nob, Lady Catherine de Bourgh (Judi Dench).""Pride & Prejudice"" follows the ebb and flow of relationships, especially between Jane and Charles and Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, against the backdrop of Mrs. Bennett's hysterical plotting.""Pride & Prejudice"" is a sumptuous period piece. Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen have remarkable chemistry that they superbly suppress throughout. Brenda Blethyn comes close to being over the top, as does Judi Dench, but the excellent flow of the storyline holds it together. Rosamund Pike pales next to Knightley's outstanding performance. Donald Sutherland does well with a minor role. The cinematography is lovely. ""Pride & Prejudice"" is a fun movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nice but...,"This movie is in many aspects far better than BBC's Pride & Prejudice series (1995). Costumes that don't give the impression of night-dresses. Better group scenes (a ball is what it should be and not a dinner party at aunt Marcie's). Good cast of supporting actors. Rosamund Pike, is all Jane Bennet should be: nice looking, fresh, shy. Brenda Blethyn's less hysteric version of Ms Bennet is enjoyable. Tom Hollander's performance is just splendid.Having said this much, I must admit that I didn't like this movie even half as much as I liked the BBC version. It just lacked this magical thing that makes your heart beats faster... quite a big accusation for a romantic movie don't you think?",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Joe Wright directed,"Keira Knightly and Matthew Mcfayden star as the couple that overcomes many obstacles before getting together. He is rich, and she has no dowry. Her sisters need husbands also. Rosamund Pike and Simon Woods are the initial connection. Jena Malone runs off with Rupert Friend. Carey Mulligan and Talulah Riley don't have boyfriends. Brenda Blethyn plays their mother. And Donald Sutherland plays their father.Judy Dench misses the mark coming on too strong. She needed to play her part
with a lighter take. Austen wrote this in 1813 when a marriage between unequal partners were very rare. This is fiction and needs the touch of fantasy. The other problem is the music score is oppressive in its constant lightness. Of course even with these two faults the film is tops.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt me","In all fairness, it is difficult to adequately display the richness of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice in a two-hour or less film. Everything seems rushed or clipped as did this version which may be somewhat forgiven.What I cannot forgive is the set and costume designs. Dull, sloppy and depressed is the only way I can describe them. At the assembly dance, most of the women look as if they hadn't washed their hair for weeks and the dresses were not entirely correct for the period.The screenplay adaption strayed too far from Jane Austen's style and use of language which caused cringe-worthy moments.On several occasions I would swear Keira Knightley attempted to emulate Jennifer Ehle's performance in the 1995 mini-series version.Overall, it was tolerable but lacked so many qualities that was available in the 1995 version adapted by the king of Austen adaptations Andrew Davies and starred Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. If you liked this version of the story, you would adore the 1995 mini-series.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A beautiful new way of watching one more adaptation of Austin's work,"My favorite scene from this film happens in the drawing room, Netherfiled. The camera starts from one point of view and ends in the exact opposite position, it explores the beauty of the whole environment's architecture, wonderful production design. This type of continuous shot seams to happen in other scenes as well throughout the whole film. The mood is also wonderful, it capture the British countryside in a very similar sensitive way that Jane Austin does in her books, but Joe Wright, rather than just reproducing it, he reinterprets it in his own style and imagination, the serene foggy mood on the mornings, the atmosphere of the end of a party, the rainy weather contrasting with the silence of the characters in despair.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I enjoyed it,"I did enjoy this version of Austen's work. I liked how the senior Bennett's showed affection to one another, minus the eye rolling and passive aggressive behavior Mr Bennett showed in the 95 Verizon. My only criticism would be that I was afraid our dear Lizzie's collar bones were going to burst through her skin and cut all the other character down. I couldn't take my eyes off of them during the movie, and I just wanted to feed her until she no longer looked as malnourished as those poor children in Africa.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

In this movie love behind Elizabeth and Darcy was so interesting (watch for Elizabeth's prejudice and Darcy's pride I mean).Aesthetic of this film it's another theme.

Disappointing for me,"Despite the cast and performances I didn't really care for this version but as the BBC 1995 production, is my all time favourite and set the bar very high for all that followed, I'm not sure it could be bettered - for me anyway. I like many of the actors but Donald Sutherland, though I like him a lot, didn't quite fit the bill for me.I watch the 1995 series when it is repeated, usually about once a year. I know it's not absolutely true to the book but it's very hard for anything to match that. It doesn't hurt that it's my favourite of all Austen's works. Closely followed by Sense and Sensibility and even though she was really too old for her part, I love the Emma Thompson version of that best.I've seen many versions of Pride & Prejudice, of varying quality and this version probably ranks 2nd for me. The absolute bottom is the dreadful 1945 version, which makes me cringe. I could only stand about 4 minutes of it last time I took a look. I like Olivier very much and am quite fond of Greer Garson but it really was dire.Completely understand that others rate this much higher but just not my preference.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Definitely a classic for all time,"Joe Wright's direction of this film was brilliant - he has done an amazing job interpreting the story in a realistic and relatable way. I have watched the film a number of times, and every time I see it, I am impressed with the countless touches - large and small - in which Wright captures the essence of feeling or expression that makes that moment memorable. Just as brilliant was the acting of every member of this cast, although I sort of wished a little more for Mary - but I guess she was supposed to be the ""shrinking violet"" of the family. And the music is so amazingly powerful and heart-bridging. This story is definitely worthy of a sequel - any Jane Austen-type authors out there, willing to create a worthy screen script? I wish to thank all of the members of this production for a truly enjoyable film.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"disappointing adaption, poor casting choices.","As an Austen fan, I must admit that I was not really expecting a great deal from this film - and I was right to have low expectations. One of the big problems with this adaptation is time; the film absolutely races along, trying to cover the main plot devices. The dialogue made my head whirl - the characters push their lines out as if they were on a dead race to the finish line, with little emotion or connection to the material.Many of the characters were woefully miscast (Kiera Knightly as Eliza! Who ever thought this was a good idea? She pitches her entire role on the same note, and it was wincingly bad in places. She seems to have had collagen injections into her top lip, with lopsided effect - very distracting!) Mathew McF, who was terrific in My Father's Den, was awful in this role - and there was really very little chemistry between the two - even the clever device of the empty ballroom couldn't cover up the lack of spark. But it's not just these two - most of the other characters were also poorly cast - even though I appreciated the effort to make the younger sisters look their ages, they just didn't seem that interesting. Notable exceptions are Donald Sutherland and Judy Dench, and the actor playing Charolotte Lucas - they were terrific and it's a pity we didn't get to see more of them. I didn't think much of the costumes or hairstyles either - the hair styles in particular seemed quite out of period.There were a few bright spots; I liked the more realistic country notes - the dirty backyard, the pigs in the kitchen, the small table with the grabby family members. I also liked the only effort in the film to show how slowly time must have seemed to pass at times, with Eliza turning in the swing as the season passed. I also thought the choice of assembly rooms was inspired, and loved the dance and ball scenes.Overall though, this is not a film for lovers of Austen, and those who loved the BBC Colin/Jennifer adaptation will be really disappointed here.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Loved this movie, but it was hard to understand.","This movie was great, it had an underlying mystery of love and marrying into money, but I felt there were parts missing. It is closely parallel to the novel, like for example the evolving love between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth, but there are many key differences. In my case, I read the novel before watching the movie, and I'm glad I did. Going back to the differences between the novel and the movie is the time aspect. While reading, it was slow and not many sharp turns until the very end. With the movie, I felt that one thing after another was happening and that made it seem like it was being rushed. Other then the rushing, the movie was good and I believe that there is a lot to love about both the movie and novel.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"It's okay, but it's not Jane Austen","I LOVED THIS MOVIE SO MUCH!!!!!! As a Jane Austen Mega Fan, this movie satisfied my daily Jane Austin fill. All of the characters of course, being creations of the late goddess Jane Austin, were perfect exhibitions of their respective personalities, the only flaw is the fact that mortal people had to try to play her immortal characters. The actors did the best they could, however as a Jane Austen Mega Fan, I could only imagine how much better the movie would have been if only Austen was there to play every character... a guy can dream I guess. Now, I should mention that I am VERY straight but thanks to Jane Austins briliant writing I could only wish I was in Darcy's strong arms like she described. Although the actor is not as handsome as Austen described him, he was pretty good for a mortal representation. My only major complaint is how the movie occasionally departed from Austen's immortal writing. I can only imagine the audacity the director felt to think that they knew this masterpiece better than Jane Austen did. It would be like a three year old painting their stupid looking house and family over the Mona Lisa. Although, to be fair, the intellectual capacity of some random director compared to the pseudo omnificent brain of Jane Austen is comparable to the difference between a three year olds and their parents, so this misguiding is understandable. Overall, I would give this movie a 9/10, purely because of the Jane Austen factor. A good try to compare, but the only 10/10 I will ever give is Jane Austen's immortal work.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pride & Prejudice,"You can't help but feel sorry for poor old ""Mr. Bennet"" (Donald Sutherland) in this drama. He is married to a domineering wife (Brenda Blethyn) and has five, yes - five daughters! They are upper-middle class, gentile and well-to-do but have a problem. The laws of inheritance insist that upon his death, their home shall pass to a distance cousin so it's important that the girls make as best a way in life for themselves as they can. That might be simpler for the beautiful ""Jane"" (Rosamund Pike) but for the others. Well there's the girlish ""Kitty"" (Carey Mulligan); the tomboyish ""Lydia"" (Jena malone); the studious ""Mary' (Talulah Riley) and the independently minded ""Elizabeth"" (Keira Knightley). It's the last who is likely to prove the most problematic as she has no intention of just marrying the local cleric ""Collins"" (Tom Hollander) or some drippy soldier like ""Mr. Wickham"" (Rupert Friend). Indeed, she only just manages to stay on the right side of good manners at a supper with the imperious ""Lady Catherine"" (Dame Judi Dench) who is surprised by her youthful fortitude of character. As ever, though, with Jane Austin there is a degree of inevitability about the denouement and when we are introduced to the equally strong willed ""Darcy"" (Matthew Macfadyen) we know that for all of their dancing around each other, their sparring, strops and tantrums there will be a spark, and whether or not that spark manifests itself into true love is the purpose of this story. Along the way, the production designer and the costumers have filled their boots. The film oozes stately homes and fine costumes, the writing enlivens almost everyone - especially the on-form Blethyn whilst Dames Judi and Penelope (Wilton) bring some gravitas to offset the engaging effort from Knightley in a role the could almost have been written for her engaging performance here. The Darcy role is amiably enough played, but that role isn't really so important in substance - it's more about his dashing eye-candiness factor that is supposed to have the hearts a-fluttering. Dario Marianelli has written a score that complements the story almost perfectly and though I did think it just a bit too long, this is classily constructed assessment of the vagaries of human nature, snobbery, aspiration and sheer bloody-mindedness and is well worth a gander.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Elegant images.,"If you have daughters, you will be impressed in the last scene.
This's a hierarchical romance in a countryside in the UK. All scenes were beautiful and elegant, especially the one whicn of the cover design.The protagnist was the second daughter in Bennet family, Elizabeth. She was strong-willed and ironic. Conversely, her elder sister, Jane, was very shy. Also, she had noisy younger sisters and their mother was a bit imprudent.Even if Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy liked each other, it was hard to see something in the close perspective. Maybe I have been bound by the pride and prejudice without knowing, too. It's hard to discard them. They're something to only protect myself, not to gain anything.

Good film but lacking where it counts,"I am an Austen fan and have seen as many P&P adaptations as it possible for me to see--I found a few TV ones listed that were not possible for me to find, but this makes the fourth adaptation I've seen, plus having read the book again and again, so I think I'm fairly qualified to give a good opinion.I love this story. It is my favorite book in the world. I have to admit here to a personal bias to the 1995 miniseries, but I went in willing to give this movie a chance (without very high expectations). I was pleasantly surprised in many respects--and disappointed in some others.First the bad things: the dialogue. I was VERY disappointed with the script. Obviously much of the story had to be cut down, and I thought they did a fairly admirable job of getting the whole plot in under the time constraints, but the dialogue they did leave wasn't Austen's dialogue, it was some semi-modern version of it that I believe was supposed to appeal more to the modern romantic-comedy audiences they thought would be viewing it. The whole heart and soul of P&P is the witty dialogue, in my opinion, and when they took it out, I thought it lost so much, it took all of the good points I mention to counterbalance that. Another disappointing thing was the (possible?) historical inaccuracies my friend and I saw. I don't claim to be a historian, but my interest in Austen and her world has led me to research the Regency period a bit, and as far as I could tell, it didn't seem as if this film had been researched fully. The sisters would go out with their hair down, and the fashions didn't always look quite right (the waistlines looked too low on a lot of the dresses). Minor details, but kind of important in making a period piece.I also have a few minor issues with the casting--overall, I thought it was fine...Donald Sutherland, excellent; Judi Dench, excellent; and I liked Rosamund Pike's Jane as well. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth was not bad on the whole, but there were a few parts where I (personally) thought she was a little too gentle or soft and ought to have been a little snappier...but then again, I grew very fond of Jennifer Ehle, who had a lot of spark, and Ms. Knightley may have had a different interpretation of the character entirely. Matthew MacFadyen did a very creditable job, I thought...NO ONE holds a candle to Colin Firth, if you ask me, but after watching David Rintoul is the 1980 miniseries, I don't think I could find worse. He did a nice job of warming up for the Pemberley!Darcy.Now for the GOOD things: the direction was wonderful. It was very original and interesting; it was something you came out of the theater remembering. There were some truly stunning shots in there--I remember one specifically where the servants were closing Netherfield as Bingley was leaving. As I said before, I'm a little biased when it comes to adaptations, so I will never see Pemberley as anything but Lyme Park, but this Pemberley was very nicely-chosen--the lake was beautiful; all the locations were very well-chosen, I think. The music was also fantastic...I especially liked the piece Georgiana played.All in all, for what it was meant to be--a modern-day romantic comedy that just happened to be set in the past--I think they did a creditable job of it all. I recommend it for Austen fans and P&P lovers...but it will never replace the book itself (or my favorite adaptation).",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's so good,"It's so good to wash our eyes and souls watching such a charming romantic movie after tons of bloodshed, violence, wars, horror, robots, special effects made by computer, etc. It's like to see something human after all. Well but I must comment on the merits of the movie itself and not dwell upon my filmic nostalgias. And besides it I don't want to give the impression that I don't appreciate many of those modern movies with bloodshed, robots, etc when they are good indeed. This movie tells us a story of the clash between the aristocratic way of life and values of England in the beginning of 19th century and that of the middle classes against the background of rural atmosphere. The members of the often impoverished middle classes aspire to imitate the aristocracy and if possible, to become its members one day too. For the girls however, the only hope is to marry noblemen preferably rich because at the time girls had no other choice for they were economically dependent since their birth because they were not allowed to get any profession or job that could bring them a substantial income. Therefore the parents of five girls like the one in the movie, whose income was rather low, had the hard task of marrying them all above their social status to avoid disgrace and ruin to the whole family. A hard task indeed. Well but human beings have feelings and sentiments and young men and girls tend to love one another irrespective of their social positions and that collides with such materialistic ideas. And the substance of romanticism is precisely this collision which was of course much more acute at the epoch portrayed in the movie than nowadays. This movie gives us that atmosphere through the good performance of its whole cast and the various scenes and dialogues where all these contradictions are shown and the sentiments are sometimes revealed sometimes concealed because of strict social and mundane or etiquette rules.

People who don't read Pride & Prejudice of Jane Austen should watch this film because this movie is not same content as historical book. Unlike now, at this era man rarely say that I love you and I feel painful and I'm sorry. Student like me maybe know that, but can't imagine that. By watching Pride & Prejudice, students can fully understand the rank and position of men. Also, in this movie there are many scenes of countryside and scenery. People must be moved by them and can feel calm. Many wonderful cloth that women wear are so beautiful, so people who watch this movie maybe attracted. I recommend Pride & Prejudice for students that want to know the culture of England.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Film ""Pride and prejudice""","""Pride and Prejudice"" is a new drama film directed by Joe Wright, based on the 1813 novel of the same name by Jane Austen. The main role is played by Keira Knightley.The action takes place at the beginning of the 19th century. Mr. And Mrs. Bennett have five unmarried daughters with a very small dowry. Mrs Bennett tries to marry them off. Not far from Longbourne, in Netherfield, a young rich bachelor Charles Bingley settles with his sister and his friend, Mr. Darcy. At a local ball, they meet the Bennets: Bingley, who has won the sympathy of all those present with his good nature, is clearly fascinated by Jane. The heir to the estate, Mr. Collins, is visiting the Bennets. Soon he proposes to Lizzie, but gets a categorical refusal. After some time, Collins proposes to his friend Lizzie Charlotte, who gladly accepts him. Bingley unexpectedly leaves Netherfield and returns to London. Jane goes to London to visit her relatives, hoping for a restoration of relations. At this time, Elizabeth goes to visit the Collins and visits Rosings, where she again meets Mr. Darcy. He confesses his love for her, but is rejected. At the end of the film, Elizabeth agrees to marry Mr. Darcy.There are no moments in the film that I might not like, as the film was shot very well and the actors conveyed all these emotions of the characters very well.I liked the film, I advise you to watch it, as there you can get acquainted with the English language of that time.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Quick overview,"At first I thought Pride and Prejudice, the 2005 film, was mediocre at best. The film, just like the book, started off at a snail's pace. Once you got through the beginning the middle to end was at least more tolerable. Once actually taking a step back and looking at the themes the film portrayed and what Jane Austen was intending. It visualized the main characters in ways it showed their quirks to society. It also highlighted how everyone's individual social class played a role in their story. With any movie some details are lost in translation from the novel, but the directors were able to preserve Austen's most important lessons while keeping the audience entertained. I would recommend the film to anyone who has read the novel, but if you have not read the novel then I believe it would be harder to follow, and you would appreciate the film less.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sutherland's sore-thumb fit as the only male in the family is a total mood.,"The particularly mundane problems of the upper class can be enveloping when the dialogue, story, and characters are this rich. Other than a few odd camera choices that show some over-excited (Pan-esque) tendencies, Wright's direction sets a peaceful, almost Ozu-like tone that grounds the melodrama beautifully.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why???,"Why was this movie ever made?! The 1995 mini series is the definitive version and the only one anybody ever needs to see. This version has been made into a cross between some sort of modern chick flick (with some - often rather dubious - period costumes thrown in) and a melodramatic version of a Bronte novel. Caroline Bingley's outfits are ridiculous (not to mention Mr. Bingley's hair style), Darcy is boring, dull and completely unconvincing, and Donald Sutherland is completely miscast as Mr. Bennet. The Bennet sisters remind me more of the March girls in Little Women with their constant (and irritating) giggling and silliness and the chemistry between Darcy and Elizabeth is non-existent. Keira is a good actress and might almost be able to carry the role off if it hadn't already been so well done by Jennifer Ehle. Unfortunately for all the good actors in Pride and Prejudice (and don't get me wrong, most of them are good) they suffer from a truly dreadful script. Maybe it's just the purist in me but when a book has been so incredibly well written, why bother to change it? All of the subtlety and most of the wit and humour is missing making the film adaptation of arguably the best book ever written into nothing more than a mildly enjoyable rom-com. As for the good points of the film, Judi Dench is great (although it is too obvious a role for her) and the locations are fantastic. Unfortunately, the writers have tried for a Cathy/ Heathcliff look for Darcy and Elizabeth with lots of dramatic scenery and sudden downpours (so not Austen's style and totally unnecessary). Overall, provided you haven't seen the 1995 mini series or read the book, you will probably find it a mildly amusing, if slightly dull, way to spend two hours. Any purists out there - stick to the book and original TV version. You won't be missing anything special by not going to see it. Sorry to be so scathing of anything Austen-related but this truly wasn't worth the time, money or effort that went into making it. I've no idea why the reviews are rating it so highly (unless it's to make more people go) but your money will be better spent buying the Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle version on DVD.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

Living Painting,"This movie is a delightful mix of wit, drama, and romance. Aspects of the book, such as the romantic tension and the lack of wealth of the Bennets, are exaggerated but in a tasteful way that makes the movie that much more appealing for the audience. Many scenes are artfully shot in a way that convinces the viewer the movie is a living painting. The music adds to this feeling, urging the audience to become totally encapsulated into the storyline. The actors and actresses involved use carefully chosen physical reactions and tones to give us a window into their thoughts while also keeping the tension and suspense throughout the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The film is a visually striking complement to the timeless novel.,"The 2005 rendition of Pride & Prejudice is a worthy depiction of the drama of finding love in Jane Austen's original 1813 novel of the same name. There was a heavy-handed (yet justified) contrast between opposites in the film, most notably in the mannerisms of the strict and austere Lady Catherine (Judi Dench) and her apparent adversary, Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley), who, though she had the capability of being serious when needed, also certainly had her moments of unfettered frivolity. This contrast, particularly between Lady Catherine and Elizabeth Bennet, is most visually striking when one compares their homes. Lady Catherine's dwelling exudes old, stuffy aristocracy, and makes a nice complement to her character. The Bennet house, on the other hand, is a trashy dump with pigs running rampant around the property. In a deeper layer of contrast, Elizabeth (and her family) make an effort to stand apart from their hectic surroundings, wishing to appear ""presentable"" for the Bingleys and Darcys of the world. Movie adaptations of classic novels have the opportunity and obligation to utilize the visual realm to further the message of the story, and this film certainly takes advantage of that.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nice if You're Short on Time,"I can't say anything horrible about this adaptation, in fact it's good. BUT if you've read the book or have had the wonderful luck to have seen the 1995 BBC version with Elizabeth Ehle and Colin Firth, then you will be underwhelmed. As you must be since this is only acceptable as a 2 hour version. The story is just too complex to be truncated down to this point. But I must say it's pretty well edited in its form.Just two appearances by Mr. Wickham, Lady Catherine de Bourgh doesn't receive enough play up to the climactic confrontation, everybody's sisters are mostly irrelevant, and Mrs. Bennet does not hold up to the portrayal by Alison Steadman; furthermore, the chemistry between Knightley and MacFadyen DOESN'T BEGIN to approach that of Ehle and Firth, among other issues.The production company should've known what they were getting into after all. So, if you can't stand the heat stay out of the kitchen. On the plus side, it is beautifully photographed with excellent cinematography and I owe someone a nickel because Keira Knightley can act.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I just hated it. After a little while, getting the mini-series out of my mind, I saw it again. I didn't like it then either.

Joe Wright brings his visual style to a very old piece of text but that cannot save the film form being slightly humdrum.,"Here we go then, another Pride & Prejudice adaptation; a novel that's been around the block so many times even the popular Indian cinema film-makers amongst the British film industry have put their own spin on things, that little episode being 'Bride' & Prejudice. That particular film came out a mere year before Joe Wright's period romp debut and this take on things from Jane Austen's novel was obviously deemed by its director a pretty good place to start off, coming from a man who'd made some shorts and done some television work but here he gets to play amidst the big fish by taking a relatively large and well-known cast; a lot of money and is let loose amongst some top quality locales. It's a shame that the result is all very here and there.I think Wright identified that the best approach, at least in his mind, for a debut is to take on someone else's subject matter or text and bring it to life in the way you deem worthy. It's a safe choice and to be fair, Wright brings the text to life with a string of attractive camera angles and shots, drifting into vast Georgian England rooms that see the mise-en-scene on most occasions just drip off the screen; wowing us with locations and sets that ooze of the authentic. But it was all an appetiser for Wright's following film Atonement, which is actually about something and actually contains a pinch of emotion complete with a connection to the characters. If whenever someone comes up to you and states Pride & Prejudice is better than Atonement, swiftly correct them.So what is this film? It's an updating of a decades old tale for the 21st Century; whether that's a good thing or not is still up for debate. The Bennett sisters Jane (Pike); Elizabeth (Knightley); Mary (Riley); Catherine (Mulligan) and Lydia (Malone) are growing up much to the delight of their unnamed mother played by Brenda Blethyn and their father who's played by a slightly miscast Donald Sutherland  his job is to pop up every now and again and offer advice to his daughters in a sort of Jiminy Cricket role. Despite all these characters and this big overall family, it's only Elizabeth that is given much of the attention and it's only her we're really interested in.What I don't like is the initial sense that these five girls are 'up for grabs'. Some girls rush into relationships and some get burnt in the process, disappearing and becoming confused whereas Elizabeth is more conservative and adopts a more mature stance in the sense she wishes to wait a while longer for that 'true' love sensation. The overall theme to do with coming of age and that mistake you might make with first impressions is clear: Elizabeth initially dislikes a certain Mr. Darcy (Macfadyen) but along the way, she will learn and mature and what have you before realising that certain things are not what they first appear.I'd be lying if I said you don't let off the odd yawn during Pride & Prejudice. It's a tale about women; about love from the perspective of women with perspective being the key word in that sentence and I guess the easy thing to say would be that I'm not of the correct audience it's aimed at. Wright's second and most recent film, Atonement, was about a certain female perspective and it too had permutation's to do with love or lust. It was a distorted and immature perspective, one that was too young to figure out what was going on and I had no trouble with that film at all.But when is all said and done, that cannot hide the film's ho-hum approach to its narrative. There are the early exchanges; the glances; the gazes and the touching of the said person as one helps the other to mount a horse upon leaving the manor house. What keeps the film afloat for most of its time is its direction, the highlight of which in a visual sense is an unbroken take as the camera waltzes through a gathering of people, switching from ground level to head height as the camera adsorbs the costume and the setting it is so lushly presenting to us, proud and prestigious indeed.Another thing I noticed is that the film avoids, or at least did it sparsely enough for me not to notice, rendering one or any of its characters objects of the gaze. This is a theory built around the construction that certain characters or 'types' of characters are shot provocatively with the camera in order to subliminally force the audience into assuming them to be attractive. From what I saw, Pride & Predujice avoids doing this and for that I commend it, something very few films in the genre that would revolve around women, love, wanting to love and relationships would be successful in doing.Towards the end and once Elizabeth has started to come to her senses, the film does run out of juice somewhat. Wright grows tired of the inventive camera angels and showing off the fancy mise-en-scene and the film needs Judi Dench's character to re-raise a little bit of interest as the climax nears, some welcome antagonism in the form of an old battle-axe role that Dench basks in. Whether the dramas of love and relationships are actually captured here and that it's just a fancy, period drama vehicle with flashy visuals and camera work remains debatable but you have to commend the film on what it does do well.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hasn't anyone seen the 1984 version?,"All of the reviewers here rave about the 1995 version (which was made by A&E). The BBC version was made in 1984 and starred Elizabeth Garvie (Elizabeth, not Susan). The BBC version of 1984 was by far the best of the four movie versions of the book. The script was written by Fay Weldon and followed the book. The cast was superb. This version has recently been released on DVD. If you want to see Pride and Prejudice as it should be, get this version. You'll never think of Colin Firth again. The 1940 script was written by Aldous Huxley. Yes, Aldous Huxley. And it was a lively abridgment of the story. The costumes, acting, etc. left a lot to be desired. This 2005 Hollywood chic remake will sell a lot of copies, thanks to the reputation of Jane Austen. But word will get around, and then this atrocity will be history.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Expressionistic passion: the sensibility of pride and prejudice.,"This film version has grown on me over time. It's not exactly Austin, in that Austin is of the age of reason, and there are many aspects of the story conveyed purely cinematically-and on occasion, perhaps too intrusively so, scenes are moved around, expanded, contracted. But this film is Byronesque, romantic, and it will not be stopped by your quibbles. Joe Wright's direction brings out the aspects of the story of love across class and power that evoke a Brontë sensibility in the characters, increasing the tension between Elizabeth's reason and passion, and bringing to Darcy a Heathcliff-like quality, especially happily realized in the transposition of the drawing room confession of a socially and rationally inappropriate passion to an outdoor Greek pavilion, with the romantic couple literally soaked in the sturm und drang weather of conflicting passions, and with a truly exquisite use of music to convey tones of emotion and interactions never fully conveyed in words. Kiera Knightly stands out as particularly superb, though the entire cast, assisted by a director who uses reaction shots excellently, highlights emotive depth. And the scenes of walking over misty fields, the very outdoor nature of this otherwise indoor story, literally opens it up, and lends the film to the full the forces of nature to overcome the bonds and strictures of society, to create a world of its own.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A new take on an old story,"Joe Wright, the director of this new adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, is a brave man indeed. Who in their right minds would even attempt to compete with the BBC's 1995 serialisation? How could anyone improve on Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle and that screenplay by Andrew Davies?Well, I'm pleased to report that Mr Wright and his assembled cast have dome a pretty fine job of it. He wisely chose to approach the story in a new way, rejecting the rather hackneyed stiff regency attitudes in favour of a more down home, grubby feel which actually lends itself rather well to the story, especially as it gives credence to Darcy's initially reluctant proposal.The performances are excellent too; even the erstwhile rather dubious Ms Knightley manages a convincing portrayal of the feisty Elizabeth, and Matthew Macfadyen brings an intriguing vulnerability to Mr Darcy.My one complaint would probably be the dumbing down of Jane Austen's dialogue; an inevitable sacrifice in today's focus group dominated society. Still, courtesy of an interestingly fresh approach, fine performances, especially key supporting roles like Mr Collins (the ever brilliant Tom Hollander) and Mrs Bennett (Brenda Blethin in a far more restrained and sympathetic portrayal than the screeching Alison Steadman we were forced to endure in '95)and some lovely cinematography, I would have to say that this movie will certainly hold up to comparison with the nation's darling mini-series.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a work!,"of art! I had barely seen a preview of Pride & Prejudice, and so when the opportunity came to see a sneak preview, I could not let it pass me by.Coming into this film, I had admired Keira Knightley's work in Bend It Like Beckham, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Love Actually, and was interested in seeing her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennett. I was not disappointed. It baffles me that this actress is only twenty; and then, when I see that she played a Padme decoy (queen decoy) on Phantom Menace, I said, ""Aha! The lower half of that face does resemble Portman!"" Back to the film...I wondered how the producers/director/writer would splice the novel into two hours, but they did so earnestly, thoughtfully, and with the chuckle of an inside joke.The costumes, scenery, and settings seem to echo a portrait more fitting than the mini- series. It felt more authentic to me as the story unfolded. The actors seem to all enjoy playing their parts: it was comical and romantic, never overly dramatic. I liked the change of where certain conversations took place. Sometimes, because of time, the writer had to transition one storyline quickly to another.A friend said, as she left the theatre, ""This is just what I needed tonight."" And I hope you get it, too, when you watch the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent version with just that little something different,"Keira Knightley's performance was a revelation - Whilst obviously extremely pretty, she was also animated, lively and young enough to bring off the freshness in Lizzies character. I thought Matthew MacFadyen was great in his role - thoughtful enough, and melting gradually throughout the film to the man who declares his love passionately at the end. I always thought that the wet shirt scene in the 1995 version was wildly overrated and very un Jane Austenish, so the passionate looks and buttoned up emotions of this one were much more in keeping with the book. MacFadyen gives a very intelligent performance and there are some great moments such as when his sister says to Lizzie that he had told her she was very good at the piano and he corrects her ""quite good, I said quite good"". The setting was also fresh and realistic - much less uptight than previous versions, with real mud, lots of animals, untidy rooms and a great feel for the period in which it is set - much less picture postcard than it could have been. At just over two hours it could have been longer - Mr Wickham could have been done more justice, as could Darcys letter, Lizzies time at Pemberley and Lizzies growing impatience to get Darcy on his own at the end - in the book she gets increasingly desperate to be able to speak to him, which just adds to the growing tension. The mist scene at the end raised a laugh in the cinema I was in - whilst I have to say that both actors looked great, and once Matthew MacFadyen had started talking I forgot about how contrived it was, it was still a bit hackneyed - more Charlotte Bronte than Jane Austen. Still - made a great poster. I also thought that the end was an anticlimax - a smile or a kiss or Lizzy rushing off to fling her arms around Darcy would have sent us all out smiling broadly. However - check out the US version of the trailer - at the end there is a two or three second clip which certainly didn't appear in the film here - so lets hope it gets reinstated in the DVD version !

A Pride and Prejudice for our day,"I see that Joe Wright's filmography as director is fairly short: apart from Atonement he has made a few historical mini-series for TV.

The ballroom dances are mostly done well, although his camera doesn't move much.The acting ranges from good to mediocre. I didn't expect much from Keira Knightley but she surprised me with some spirited exchanges with Mr Darcy. Matthew MacFadyen looks a little defeated by the demands of his part; he's following two magnetic actors, Lawrence Olivier and Colin Firth, and cannot match them for charisma. Donald Sutherland shows no commitment to Mr Bennet, it's a lazy performance. Charlotte Lucas is played by Claudie Blakley who makes you believe in her desperation.

Such a beautiful movie,"This is by far my favorite adaptation of Pride and Prejudice (and I've seen all the available versions except the Mormon one- 1940, 1980, 1995, and Bride and Prejudice). This movie is very realistic in that it portrays how unclean times were back then (no, it's not dirty or gross or anything, don't worry). Perhaps the filmmakers went a little too far in the case of the Bennet house, but that was done to contrast their situation to those of Darcy and Bingley.The casting is excellent. I was hesitant about Keira Knightley at first (I'd only seen a couple of her other movies and liked her in Bend it Like Beckham), but her Lizzy blew me away. She portrayed the arch, outspoken side of Lizzy as well as her sweet, unoffensive nature. She also really showed the character's youth. Matthew McFayden's Darcy was totally different from any interpretation I've seen (shy, puppydog) but I couldn't call it inaccurate. He and Lizzy really have chemistry together. Brenda Blethyn was an amazing Mrs. Bennet- she is annoying and embarrassing but believable not over-the-top. Rosamunde Pike is the beautiful Jane I have been waiting for. None of the other Janes I've seen are even as pretty as Lizzy. Some of the changes people might not like (but that I love)- Bingley is more of a goof, Caroline is a little meaner, Mary is prettier, and Mr. Bennet a more caring father (this one did bother me a little).On top of the great cast, the cinematography is breathtaking, the music is beautiful, it uses a lot of Austen's own dialogue (but changes some of it slightly), and it's also hilarious. This was perhaps my favorite movie of 2005.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
romance without kissing,"I went into this movie expecting nothing and ended up really enjoying this movie. It´s really fun and the romance and drama is compelling. Sprinkle in great camerawork and you got a good movie.In a time where women are being married off. The Bennet family is trying to marry off their oldest daughter. The next to oldest daughter, Elizabeth, is confronted by many possible candidates of love and most navigate the many different offers.The camerawork is actually noticeably pretty amazing in this movie. The editing also helps this and the passage of time scene at the swing is so well done. The movie creates such beautiful frames that look neatly picturesque and is so well shot. The camera movement is also amazing, creating this living camera that moves us through complex buildings and shows us what multiple characters are up to in what seems to be real time. There are some weird zooms and camera adjustments here and there though. It reminds me of something like The Office and it seems not fitting for the movie. But generally, the camerawork is very good.The production is also really well done. The costume designs are amazing and the set designs too. It´s one of those big spectacle movies that really wants to mimic the time period it´s set in. A lot of care is put into the production, and you can fell that.The score is also really good. It´s fitting in both time and tone, and really elevates the different scenes it´s used in.The performances in this movie are really good. Keria Knightly gives a great performance as the lead. Her smile can seem very forced most of the time. Maybe it´s the character? Hard to say, but other than that she shows a great and complex range of emotions in a complex movie. In general, there are so many memorable and fun performances and that's something I didn't expect form this movie, laughing so much. The awkward and class humor really landed with me, and I laughed so many times during this movie. It has an amazing sense of humor that fits so well in a movie that critiques everything this time stood for. Characters that are put in their place is fun and characters not carrying about that is just as fun. Mr. Darcey´s deadpan demeanor during a party, Mr. Bennet trying to make sense of a house full of women and actually carrying while not, Lady Catherine criticizing everyone, all of these characters and their reactions to the world are iconic and so fun.This is an interesting romance movie communicate through dialogue and unseen deeds. A challenge of this movie was not showing someone kiss and it doesn't happen. This would be a death sentence to most romance movies, but here it feels at home and well done. The movie Cleary want to commentate on what love is and was at this time. It´s not about kissing and being promised away, it´s about what you would do for someone else at what lengths you would go to. It creates this genuine felling of caring and love that goes beyond simple gestures and the movies handles this perfectly.Other than that, it´s just a good drama. So many characters cross paths and interact in new and dramatic ways that are so compelling. Learning about them and getting to know them better really intensifies the drama between everyone and makes you question your loyalty to the different characters. It´s handled well and I was engaged throughout.This is a solid movie that takes a stern look on a time in history and turns it on its head. It mucks a time where love was not really the point of relations and makes fun of the class battles at the time. It´s both a compelling drama and a really fun movie with a great production and fantastic camera directing. A just solid movie I´ll gladly revisit.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bronte light,"I finally got a chance to watch this latest version and I found it lacking in just about every category. The movie's gloomy, dark undertones didn't capture Austen's beautiful story nor does it compare favorably to the far superior BBC version starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. I felt like I was watching Bronte light rather than anything remotely related to Pride and Prejudice. The producers behind this production should have been more honest and simply adapted one of the Bronte sister's works rather than butchering Austen's classic.One of my biggest complaints is the decision to replace Austen's beautiful language for inferior dialog and modern terminology that sounded awkward and inappropriate. As far as the acting, while I liked Macfadyen's Darcy, I thought Knightly's Elizabeth was insipid and unappealing.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
i simply loved this movie,i was not interested in watching this movie i had watched the BBC version and i loved it i thought this would have nothing new to add but i must say i was very surprised my sister blackmailed me into going to cinema and i have never been so grateful to have gone. it was a lovely picture simply lovely i even forgot how young everyone was. the scenery was like nothing i had expected and finally i understood why the Bennett family was not equal to the others. the difference in circumstances is well brought out so i decided i'm getting the DVD it was superb. those who love a good love story should go rent/buy the DVD i just felt like i understood Mr. Darcy and the Bennets better.,9.0,Anonymous,Romance

This film wouldn't have been as great as it is if anyone else played the lead roles.Keira Knightley is perfect as Elizabeth Bennet.She really brings her to life.The romantic tension between Mr.Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet really captured my attention in this film.I couldn't wait to see if they would ever follow their hearts.Matthew Macfadyen is so charming despite the fact his character seems to be timid and unhappy.This movie is perfect for fans of love stories.Go see it!,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unexpectedly Powerful,"I was compelled to see this movie twice within as many days. I found myself moved beyond what I'd thought possible considering the genre and relative predictability of the ending. The acting, screenplay, casting, cinematography, music, set and costume design was in its totality simply ""incandescent."" This is exactly the feeling that I hope for at the conclusion of every movie that I see and book that I read. (Having said this, I should mention that I've just bought the book for a sentimental rereading with context, and intend to buy the DVD and soundtrack - What's become of me?)

"If you have read Pride and Prejudice, then you should know.","I thought Pride and Prejudice was an overall excellent film and the best movie that I have seen this fall season. It was certainly better than Harry Potter which I had seen the week before. I didn't think that any adaptation of Jane Austen's beloved book would surpass that of the 5-hour version with Colin Firth but this one has certainly done that. Keira Knightley truly embodied the character of Elizabeth Bennet and Matthew MacFadyen played Mr. Darcy with the perfect touch of sensuality and awkwardness. I also couldn't imagine how Austen's lengthy love story could fit into a mere two hour length but it was done superbly. The actors were all well-chosen, but I do have to comment on the rather goofing nature of Mr. Bingley in this film. I did not imagine him to be the way he was but nevertheless, he only contributed positively to the quality of this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not as good as the film.,"I think that this film is able to grasp the attention of many younger viewers, than that of whom are interested in the book. Wright perfectly captures the main idea of the book, while leaving out the less important aspects. While choosing which parts of the book to leave out, however, I think that too many important parts of the novel were left out. For example, while pride was a relevant theme in both the book and the movie, prejudice did not seem to make the final cut. I think some of the major themes that help shape the book were clearly left out. Without these themes, you are still able to get the main idea of the book, but it is just not quite as good.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Great Masterpiece,"I have never seen this movie before until two nights ago when my friends persuaded me to watch it that and I ran out of movies. The first night I was watching it I decided that I wasn't up for a chick flick and went to sleep but the following night I decided that I will watch it, and it blew my mind away , right about now I have seen this movie about four times. I cried so much just because I thought it was the sweetest movie I had ever seen. Ms. Jane Austen did an incredible job with this masterpiece. In fact it has had me thinking really hard about life. The movie was sweet in the way it portrayed modern day life. It was exceptionally great. I must comment the actors on how well of a job they did I couldn't even see them as themselves but as their characters. Anyhow you should see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A classic movie with a few flaws,"Pride and Prejudice was an enjoyable movie that has become a cult-classic among many Jane Austen fans. It properly expresses the early 19th-century without feeling too old and boring. With the beautiful scenery of the English countryside and the period-appropriate music, it felt like the watchers were being taken into the novel. Most of the actors accurately portrayed the characters as they are presented by Jane Austin, especially the actress who played Mrs. Bennet and the actor who played Mr. Collins. Kiera Knightley actually managed to make Lizzie Bennet more likable in the film by giving her a more playful personality. Matthew McFadden humanized Mr. Darcy by showing him being more vulnerable while still maintaining his character's awkward aloofness. One thing I would critique about this movie is the pacing of the romance. Mr. Darcy fell in love way too quickly with Elizabeth for it to be believable. The director tried to make it seem like he was enamored with Elizabeth from the moment he saw her. I find it hard to believe that Darcy would desire a woman who he called ""barely tolerable"" and too below him in rank to be his wife. Instead, we should have seen Darcy slowly begin to fall in love with Elizabeth once he realizes that her personality is far more desirable than her title. Despite this, the movie is beautifully filmed and is definitely worth a re-watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unpardonable,"I could forgive an awful lot. I could forgive cutting characters and reassigning dialog and so forth, given the enormously difficult prospect of cutting down such a large novel to fit into movie length. I could forgive inclinations to modernize, or take liberties with historicity. I could forgive a deliberate attempt to stake out a different take on a well-worn classic. Mind you, I wouldn't forgive easily, but I could forgive.But the one thing I can NOT forgive: stripping this work of its humor! The sparkling wit and hilarious characters which make up Austen's original (and which shine through so splendidly in the '95 mini-series version) are undeniably what I love most about P&P, and to deprive me of them deprives me of all interest in the project. Whereas in the original, Mrs. Bennett, Mr. Bennett, and Mr. Collins are all *hilarious* in their separate ways, here they are most decidedly *not*. The problem is clearly in the script and direction, not the actors. Both Mrs. Bennett and Mr. Collins seem game and able, but the script/direction lets them down: Mrs. Bennett has clearly been *deliberately* sabotaged to make her more sympathetic, and Mr. Collins simply doesn't get enough screen time to wax on and on about Rosings and Lady Catherine (I mean, seriously, how are we to understand this great woman's outstanding character if we are deprived of knowing how she herself personally specified the shelves in the upstairs closets! :) ) But the worst offense is Mr. Bennett. I simply cannot believe Sutherland to be that inept, it had to be the director's idea to turn the witty, bemused Bennett into a henpecked nincompoop. Geez, at times he actually seems to be genuinely interested in and enthusiastic about his wife's ridiculous plotting! He was just AWFUL.Truthfully, this production probably deserved more than the one star I gave it (maybe three), but when I saw reviews gushing over this mess, I simply HAD to throw some more weight on the negative side.Just watch the BBC/A&E mini-series version, or read the book; they are both fantastic.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Prejudice Makes Love,"Personal favorite this year so far. Not just because I was a big fan of Jane Austin, but the delicacy and vividness within the film. A female tone with sensitivity to express the relationships among family, friends, acquaintances, and man-to-woman.One of the most memorable shots was the one when Lizzy sitting on the wheel(or tire), just wondering what's wrong that happening to her so far. Family welfare never occurred to her as an important issue, since she was a independent and mind-free woman. Somehow when she was circling and watching the world around her, her world was falling down. The well-established philosophy of her own was corrupting. Her best friend, Charlotte, came toward her as a intruder of her very mind. The bomb exploded, but still cannot help her free herself from her own stubbornness.The second shock was when Darcy told her about all the feelings for her. The scene was raining and she was in a deserted house. Darcy found her, and she was shocked by all his truths of her state. Never been so offended by such a pride man. Angry filled with her mind. She fought back with a sudden pose and meanest words to him. After his leaving, Elizabeth sighed and found herself lonelier than ever.The highlight was arranged in the end of the film. When Betsy was questioned by Lady Catherine in the middle of the night, her sleepless made her walking in the field. Different from the original story, her frankness toward Darcy occurred on the most romantic moment--dawn with glimmering and radiance of the sun. When he asked her again, she just kissed his hand, and said ""your hands are cold."" A final relief for the audience, we could see the happy ending in the end of the film. Elizabeth Bannet's prejudice made herself complete in life.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not the greatest adaption ever made..,"""Sometimes the last person on earth you want to be with is the one person you can't be without""It is a truth universally acknowledged that a blockbuster film of large budget must be in want of some dumbing down. As is witnessed in this tremendously altered version of Pride and Prejudice. The transformed novel has (I imagine) been changed to suit a wider audience than a few hundred single women, this time the target audience has been the MTV generation. The ill advised changes have been focused mainly on the language; Mr Darcy's character I am certain, would never have allowed him on an invitation to dance to reply 'Not if I can help it'. This is truly not the proud character we all know and love.Along with Lizzie's Pride and Darcy's Prejudice, I cannot imagine a better suited couple to cast than Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfadyen. Their on-screen chemistry made the film irresistible to watch. Another successful choice of cast was that of Jane Bennet (Rosamund Pike). Her radiant beauty rightfully outshone that of her sister Lizzie, whose beauty was 'tolerable'. Unfortunately the choice of Mr Bennet was unfathomable. Donald Sutherland's delivery of the role was lacking any of the subtle British humour which permeates all of Austen's work. As we have come to expect Dame Judi Dench was rolled out for another matriarchal performance as Lady Catherine De Bourgh. On this occasion she failed to steal any of the scenes from the more youthful cast.If any character was likely to steal the show from Miss Knightly and co. it could well have been the great British countryside. Never has Derbyshire looked more enticingly romantic. Meanwhile the rustic Bennet farmhouse provided startling contrast to Mr Darcy's majestic Pemberly. Something that has been wanting in previous productions. Perhaps my favourite scene, that in which Darcy finally professes his love, benefited from dramatic use of a good old British rainstorm.All of this rounds up to a film greater than the sum of its parts. While the film is flawed the Jane Austen tale bears the retelling. Joe Wright has just about pulled off his first feature film; we wait to see what lessons he has learnt with his next film 'Atonement', another adaptation this time of a more modern classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Tried, but not true","No spoilers here.Jane Austen's novel has been adapted time and again for stage and screen, both small and large to varying degrees with success.This latest outing notwithstanding has tried to do the same with an extremely talented cast. But whereas one expected scintillating performance we are greeted with a rush of scenes where continuity takes a back seat to rushing through the editing process.Granted, two hours is hardly enough time to crunch through the dense material, but the condensing of the story leaves the audience with little understanding of why such behaviour was both acceptable and expected of the time. The director and studio concentrated less on the actual pride and Prejudice and more on the romance between two supposed souls of the heart.Moreover, the leads spent more time giving meaningful glances at each other and less on the delivery of their lines. I was left to think Mr Darcy suffered more from from ulcers than a pompous ego, and Elizabeth from constipation.Artistic license was used to condense some characters (or lose them altogether), and certainly not every speech was word for word (from the book). The cast made the most of a mediocre script, but truly Judy Dench and Donald Sutherland provided very nuanced performances.It will pass the time, but don't expect the mood to match the novel.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
an example to it's genre,"One can feel daunted by the task of taking in a two hour chamber dramedy of manners, where the focus of excitement tends to fall not on a character's chance of heart but on their next chance of wardrobe. It's common enough to see such a project with lots of entrances and exits with bowing and curtsying, giggling girls and stiff men with overgrown sideburns, a lead actress who's obviously too old, and a night interior which the light coming from the fireplace illuminates the room a little too evenly.With that in mind I was consistently surprised by this version of the Jane Austen novel. The dialog-reliant tale of romantic misunderstanding and class relations has been made into a film that is faithful at least in spirit, but is refreshing in it's presentation.Casting is key. The Bennett family, at the center of the story, is a wonderful example in itself of ensemble acting when it works. A mix of seasoned professionals and new faces (though mostly the former), there is wonderful chemistry between them.Kiera Knightly's portrayal of Lizzie, the central character, is marvelous. Knightly, a talented and achingly gorgeous creature, has everything it takes to place herself in both the character and the time period, while remaining a real, identifiable point of reference for the character. Some of her mannerisms seem a bit modern and unusual for this type of film. When she meets a handsome male character for the first time, she sneaks a peak at his bottom. It may not sound very significant, but moments such as that, and there are many, give her character the truth, the timelessness, it needs. This skill extends to many of her fellow performers. True to the time, accessible to modern eyes, timeless. Many scenes have the breeze and honestly of a superior teen comedy.The camera-work, by Roman Osin, is equally exemplary. The camera moves quite frequently, more than one would expect. The colors register beautifully, particularly in outdoor scenes. And perhaps the most inventive scene of all would be the one with the swing at the gate. (If you want to see what I mean, you'll just have to go and see it. I can't do it justice with a description)Don't forget, of course, that this is still a period film, and it does still feature many of the hallmarks (some might say pitfalls) of the genre. Personally I enjoy such films even if they do consist mostly of medium shots of Emma Thompson in a corset, suffering by the window. There is the presence of Dame Judi. Nothing against her, she is a predictable presence, though a welcome enough one. The men in the film are also stock character types, but this may be something to accept. After all, it's women's film.I would not suggest this film to a casual viewer, but I do advise seeing the film to anyone with a decent attention span and an open mind. In some small but enchanting ways, it's a fresh take on a classic story and a genre known for being predictable. Hopefully we will be seeing more from it's director, Joe Wright, very soon.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Chicken Soup Kind of Movie,"The best way I can describe this movie is that it's like chicken soup: it's warm and cozy on a cold day, but it doesn't really have that much lasting substance on it's own. Don't get me wrong--I love Jane Austin as much as the next person, and by all means, this -is- a good movie. I just don't like it very much. And after viewing it three times, I think I can finally explain why.Before I begin, Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austin's most famous work, and for good reason. It's witty, it's analytical, it's thoughtful... I could go on. So it was inevitable for Hollywood to make an adaptation like this. Make no mistake; my review is solely based on this -particular- adaptation, and not Pride and Prejudice itself.Now, I think what rubs me the wrong way the most about this movie, is that it's too pretty. Yes, that may seem a bit odd, for a movie that has Lizzie tromping through a field with her dress stained with mud, but I stand by what I said. My problem isn't what's on the screen, but how it's shot. It keeps trying to be most beautiful, profound movie ever, when really...it's not. It comes across as hollow at times, and borderline pretentious. It just screams ""give me an Oscar, give me an Oscar!"" which it did go on to win. But I feel like it won those Oscars for the wrong reasons.One of my biggest complaints is Keira Knightly as Elizabeth. She does a good job, but I just can't get behind this casting choice. Keira Knightly is not the right actress for Elizabeth. She just has the wrong temperament.The best way I can describe it is like this... The character of Elizabeth Bennett is like a goose. Sure, she may be more elegant than nattering ducks like her mother and two sisters, but she's still kind of awkward, pushy, and not afraid to speak her mind. Her defining feature is -not- charm and poise, but rather her quick wit and sharp tongue. That's the reason Mr. Darcy falls in love with her to begin with--because she's the only woman he's ever met, who doesn't suck up to him.By contrast, Keira Knightly is like a swan. She glides from scene to scene, looking elegant and graceful with every word she says. She does a great job as an actress, but her temperament is all wrong. She's just too beautiful, too calm, and too poised to play the part of loud-mouthed, pushy Elizabeth Bennett.And while I'm at it, Matthew Macfadyen isn't the right fit for Mr. Darcy either, and for the same reason. He feels like he walked out of a boy band instead of being bred and manicured for high aristocracy. Just sayin'.I could go on to talk about how the cinematography in this film is trying waaaayyy too hard to be artsy and meaningful, but I won't bother. Because at the end of the day, the fundamental problem with this movie isn't that Keira Knightly played Elizabeth, or the overuse of experimental cinematography, no. The REAL problem with this movie is that it isn't trying to be Pride and Prejudice, so much as it's trying to be Sense and Sensibility 2. This movie wasn't made by someone who loved Pride and Prejudice. This movie was made because some Hollywood executive saw how successful Sense and Sensibility was in 1995, and they wanted to make another one. THAT'S the problem with this movie. Simply put, it just lacks passion. REAL passion. It tries to imitate passion by being grand and sweeping, but the heart isn't there.That being said, I'm sure a lot of people worked really hard on this film, and they have nothing to apologize for. It also has captured the heart of my dad, and I did watch it three times. It -is- a good movie. It's just not a -great- movie. If you like it, you like it; if you don't then you don't. Watch it if you're a fan of Austin, or if you're sick and just want to curl up on the couch for a couple hours. That's what I did.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Fantastic Movie!!,"I saw this movie last night and it was wonderful. The acting was sensational! The acting was extraordinary! Every character seemed entirely real! I have never read the book, but now that I have seen the movie, I really want to read the book! It was sometimes hard to hear what the characters were saying and sometimes they talked so fast, I could not comprehend what they were saying. That is basically the only reason I give this movie a 9/10. The visuals are stunning. What I mean is that, for example, the sunsets, the star nights, etc, are pulchritudinous. This is just a great story. I highly recommend you see this movie! One of the best movies of the year!!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wuthering Prejudice,"After seeing this film, I came to the conclusion that if they had taken the same cast, sets, costumes etc, but instead of making Pride and Prejudice they had made Wuthering Heights, it would have been absolutely fantastic.As it was, in my opinion Colin Firth has nothing to worry about, his well-deserved reputation as THE Mr Darcy isn't under any threat.The précis of the story was very well done considering there is an awful lot of content to get into 2 hours of film, but at the cost of much of the characterisation, comedy and humour.And I'm not sure what the long scenic shots of Elizabeth staring (into the distance, at statues, at herself in the mirror) were meant to achieve. There could have been more actual content instead. Jane Austen didn't bother with elaborate scenic imagery and the film didn't really need to either.It's definitely worth seeing this version, but for me the definitive one remains the 1990s BBC adaptation.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Love it, superior to the 1995 mini series","I think ones tastes depends on which movie was seen first. I am a huge fan of Austen and the Bronte Sister, and yes, I have read the books.I had no interest in seeing any adaptation, as I was never sure I would come to like them. The book, a commentary on the treatment of women, whose lives and social status depended upon having a suitable husband and marriage. It is also a book about perception, prejudices based on first impressions.This movie was passionate, and lush, with beautiful cinematography. Keira Knightly was outstanding, as was Matthew McFayden as Mr. Darcy, the towering man of wealth, suffering unrequited love of Elizabeth Bennett, who despises him. The entire cast was stellar, and Rosamund Pike as Jane was lovely, and her acting superb. This was a very well-rounded cast. Mrs. Bennett was as shrill and nervous as expected, and Mr. Bennett as indifferent and dismissive as I expected him to be.Keira delivered her lines with such aplomb, I can watch this movie over and over again. I would have loved to her with Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy,, can you imagine how outstanding that would be? That said, Matthew McFayden is EQUALLY fantastic as Colin Firth in this role. But far more sympathetic to me than Firth's Mr. Darcy. McFayden's Mr. Darcy almost seemed too vulnerable and lovelorn, but his performance makes up for the liberty taken with this aspect of Mr. Darcy's character.My thoughts on the 1995 version... Ehle smirked too much. And at inappropriate times. And her eyes wandered, she often looked away from the other actors when speaking to them in scenes. Almost like she is lost in thought. And that bothered me. Elizabeth is a fiery spirit, and Ehle was far too passive in her depiction. I feel that Keira embodied everything I imagined Elizabeth Bennett to be. I felt that Ehle's acting was below average. But she was the first to tackle our beloved Elizabeth, so she receives more credit than she deserves for the role. I also found the final proposal from Mr. Darcy to Elizabeth a bit perfunctory, and unromantic. But I blame the director, not the actors. They didn't even look at each other. Ehle spouts her dialogue, like an 8th grader in a school play. Though, in some scenes she excelled. Firth was everything I expect of Mr. Darcy. Jane, from the 1995 version, was not the beauty the book wrote of, and I found her face and smile off-putting, if you'll forgive me for saying such a rude thing. She's fine, but not what I imagine Jane to look like, Ehle was much pretty when Jane was supposed to be the prettier of the sisters. I felt 2005 got this right, while managing to cast a stunning beauty like Keira in the role of Elizabeth, muting her attractiveness just enough so that Rosamund Pike could truly shine.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Why I Think Jane Would Have Approved,"It is my sincere wish that Jane Austen readers and non-readers not miss a big screen viewing of Joe Wright's ""Pride & Prejudice"" because they let themselves be influenced by negative comments from the Ellen Jamesian sect of the Jane Austen society. Particularly odious are those presumptuous enough to declare that Austen herself would consider the film a disservice. Attempting to discourage potential viewers in this manner reveals not just a staggering conceit, but an utter cluelessness about how to read a film and about the power of a visual medium.This film adaptation of Austen's classic is the first one to fully capture its essence within the economical and efficient package of a two-hour feature film. And it does so in a technically proficient way (cinematography-production design-editing); with perfect physical casting, excellent directing and scene staging, and fine performances from the entire ensemble. In isolation it is simply the best film ever made, but because it is not an original screenplay the critics have downgraded it a bit from A plus to A minus (their acknowledgment of the debt it owns to Austen).Jane Austen once said, ""an artist cannot do anything slovenly"". Joe Wright's film is not perfect but it is the least slovenly in cinema history. I was reminded of this by the film's treatment of Georgiana, Darcy's sister. Georgiana was a minor but extremely important character in the book. Elizabeth's point of view observations of Darcy's tender treatment of his shy little sister is how Austen shows Elizabeth's first realization that Darcy is worthy of her love. Initially I was disappointed that Georgiana only has two brief appearances in the film, but on reflection I realized that the scenes had been staged and scripted so well that they said everything needed about the relationship dynamics of the three characters.The film successfully brings Austen's ironic (insert comic here) observations of character and manners to the screen. As the title proclaims, this story has a double theme, the pride of the aristocrat prejudicing the middle class heroine against him. But as Elizabeth explains to her father in my favorite scene, she and Darcy are the flip sides of each other as her pride has long blinded her to Darcy's efforts to overcome the prejudice of his class to hers.The film also captures the more critical macro element of Austen's novel, the idea of a generous humanness that can transcend the motivations of social class. Society is imperfect and while the social order encourages foolish prides and mean prejudices, it also enables kindness, affection, and courage. In the film's movement of events there is a modulation between vices and virtues in which the latter more than mitigates the former. This was Jane Austen's primary ""value"" and what I think would have formed the basis of her judgment and ultimate approval of the film.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A ""must see"" for hopeless romantics","The depiction of the period was done quite well, although it never really takes you ""there"". The focus is clearly on the story, which is well done and to be admired by hopeless romantics like myself. I never read Austen's book, but the dialogue both external and internal obviously comes from brilliant writing.Kiera Knightly is absolutely striking, even in her 'dressed down' role. Her mannerism didn't stray to far from her endearing ways in ""Love Actually"", but fit the character of Lizzy well. Her confidence and articulation held true to the well written dialogue. Matthew MacFadyen caught me by surprise. He did a magnificent job portraying a man that appears arrogant, but is very different beneath the surface. Supporting characters were all well cast from Sutherland, Dench and Blethyn as well as the siblings (Blethtn was quite colorful, younger sisters a bit silly). In fact, Sutherland really touched me in his father-daughter scene.The romance falls into place neatly (almost too neatly) and sniffles could be heard throughout the theater during the final scenes (including mine). Definitely worth the $X to see on the big screen for those that still believe in romance.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
How Lovely,"This movie is, perhaps, perfect. I saw it four times in four weeks, always on the same day, and that way I knew that I had this treat waiting for me on Tuesday. I teach Jane Austen at a University in the UC system, so I am familiar with her work as well as with the film and television adaptations. This movie is better than what most people know as 'the Colin Firth mini-series'while it understandably cannot follow the facts of the book as accurately as the much longer mini-series, it has much more life in it than the mini-series, life that seems translated directly from the book, but also a life of it. The movie delights in a sort of beauty which is rich with colour and water and lightright now I am imagining the deep water-fed grass and the trees that seem a little prehistoric or fantastic; Keira's dresses, her eyes, the take through the ball which, after turning a corner, rests finally on Keira's sad face in a blue shadow. An abridged version of all that might be just to say that Pride and Prejudice is graceful. It is filled to the brim with grace. The even deeper, governing genius of the movie is in its presentiment of something sacred; we get closer, we get further away, and at acute focal points we are pulled almost right to the centre of that something sacred. See this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Feels like reading a Book out of Georgian England on Big Screen,"Plot Outline: The story is based on Jane Austen's classic love story set in 18th century England, the family of Bennets including five daughters whose future is dependent on finding well-settled husbands. The Bennets brush with high society sophistication when the eldest (Rosamund Pike) is to be engaged to a wealthy Mr. Bingley whose friends include the wealthy, handsome and snobbish Mr. Darcy. The unfolding drama portrays pride, judgmental reactions and finding real love in the perspective of the beautiful and individualistic Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley).Comment: The thought of watching a classic had made me initially apprehensive about watching the movie. But as soon as the characters of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth start taking life, it is difficult not to get absorbed into the story. Although I haven't read Jane Austen, I must say that the screenplay is excellent and captures 18th Century England, its picturesque landscapes and formal societies well. Elizabeth is the strongest character of the movie and Keira Knighley has done a wonderful job although de-glamorized.The movie has a lot of noteworthy moments; especially the comical one's involving the poor Mr. Collins and the exchange of words between the Bennett parents. Rosamund Pike looks lovely and Keira character also considering the fact that she is 20 something is intriguing and absorbing and is the protagonist of the story. Mcfadyen has done justice to the role of Mr. Darcy a true blue-blooded gentleman. The movie is recommended for those who love well-made classics or even for just watching Keira Knighley.Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

I think, that nobody , who did not red the book can understand, whats going on and why! The long scenic shots imply , that it was not a time problem. It was a bad script!!!!!There were huge holes in the storyline, so that the story does not make any sense. The motivation of characters were left out in order to show rainy meadows and minutes of walking in them.Even as a independent love story , the film did not make any sense to me. If it did not had the famous title , i am sure, you could not see it even broadcasted on Hallmark channel. I was so pleased with the adaptation of Emma , I hoped to find the same kind of competence.

A story about love and its many forms,"Excellent adaptation. This version surpasses the BBC mini-series in many respects, especially due to it's well condensed format.Where to start? Would it be the riveting soundtrack, that keeps one interested throughout the whole film? Or would it be the scenery in the movie, which takes the viewer on a memorable journey through rural England the likes of paradise? A garden of Eden that one just does not interact with so commonly in the urban scapes of today? Or the costumes, that literally plunge you into the Victorian era they are so well designed? Or the stellar acting?Mr. Sutherland Sr puts on one of the best performances I have seen in a long time, the two older Bennets also being worth praise. Lizzie (Keira Knightley) does not look so pretty after her lip surgery, but who cares? She does a great job too, and the movie is so good one is forced to overlook such trivialities. Jane (Rosamund Pike) truly shines in subtle tones I did not believe her capable of, after that James Bond affair.At the centre of the success of this new remake of the Jane Austen novel is the powerful grip this piece gets on the viewer. Let us not forget the character of the story - idyllic, no doubt, but isn't that what we all wish our own life was like?Donald will make you laugh, as will the ongoing sarcasm between Darcy (Matthew Macfadyen is clearly the star of the show, putting Colin Firth's more subdued interpretation in a drawer. A true achievement from his part, portraying the generally misunderstood good - if brutally frontal - man to perfection!) and Lizzie among other little details.For most of the movie I found myself at least smiling or else wishing events would not happen the way they do..in short, the movie makes you feel good, and truly enraptures you.A fine piece! 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A romantic movie you cannot miss!,"In my opinion, this is the best romantic movie I have seen since The Notebook. I have read the book, and found it very confusing, luckily by the time I finished the movie had come out. I ventured out to watch it and was amazed! While it was still difficult to understand in some parts, I loved every minute. I found myself crying at the end...although I do not know how I found it sad! The movie was a little long, but it obviously needed to be in order to fit every beautifully crafted moment into it. If I could change one thing, I wish it would have had more sensuality in it. I believe if a movie would be so romantic, it must have some physical contact to convince us. I suppose because of the rating PG this could not be done. I would convince all of you to see this movie, and then perhaps read the book. I was not disappointed at all and neither will you!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
The New Definitive Elizabeth Bennet,"Although it is probably her best-known novel, and the only one which had previously been filmed, in 1940 with Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson, ""Pride and Prejudice"" seemed to miss out in the great Jane Austen cycle of the late nineties which saw filmed versions of ""Sense and Sensibility"", ""Mansfield Park"", ""Persuasion"" and two of ""Emma"". The reason was doubtless that film-makers feared comparisons with the highly popular British television adaptation from 1995. The makers of this film obviously felt that memories of that series have faded over the last decade, but the comments on this board suggest that that is not so and that Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle are still the definitive Mr Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet in many people's minds.The director Joe Wright seems to have had the quite deliberate intention of giving the film a different look to that normally associated with Jane Austen, presumably in order to differentiate it from other cinema and television adaptations of her works. It is set in the 1790s, the decade in which the novel was written, rather than in the 1810s, the decade in which most Austen adaptations are set. (The 1940 version, however, was updated to the 1840s, according to legend because the studio had just made another film with an early Victorian setting and wanted to reuse the sets and costumes). The social divisions between the lovers are emphasised more than usual; Mr Darcy's home Pemberly is represented by Chatsworth House, one of England's grandest stately homes, whereas the Bennets are shown as impoverished country gentry living in a shabby manor house.Having seen the latest version I can say that, for me at least, there is a new definitive Elizabeth, the lovely Keira Knightley who brings out all the wit, charm, spirit and determination of Austen's heroine. She is also suitably fresh and youthful, which is important. There is evidence from her books that Austen regarded even women in their late twenties (like Anne Elliott in ""Persuasion"" or Charlotte Lucas in ""Pride and Prejudice"" itself) as being past their prime as far as marriage was concerned. She would have been very surprised to learn that in the twentieth century her heroines would be played by actresses in their late thirties; Greer Garson was 36 in 1940, as was Emma Thompson when she made ""Sense and Sensibility"" in 1995.Unfortunately, I cannot say that I was as impressed by Matthew MacFadyen as Darcy. Olivier and Firth both played him as a traditional, impeccably dressed English gentleman. MacFadyen's Darcy, with his long hair, open-necked shirts and farouche manner, is an improbably Byronic figure, more reminiscent of a Heathcliff or Mr Rochester come straight from the windswept moors than of an Austen hero. (Byron had a considerable influence on the younger generation of novelists such as the Brontes, but none at all on his older contemporary Austen, who disapproved of his morals). Colin Firth was able to convey a sense that underneath his calm, unruffled exterior Darcy was a man of strong emotions; MacFadyen has a wilder, more romantic look, but there is no sense of anything going on beneath the surface.One of the advantages of a television as opposed to a cinematic adaptation of a classic novel is that the former generally has a longer running time and can therefore follow the plot more closely. A two-hour feature film will inevitably involve a greater amount of condensation than will a five-hour series, and one of the effects of this is that characters tend to be less well developed. (Because of the differences between the two media, I will not venture an opinion as to whether this ""Pride and Prejudice"" was better than the BBC's version). In order to concentrate on the Elizabeth/Darcy romance, a number of Austen's other interesting characters are rather downplayed in this film, such as the dashing but caddish seducer Wickham, the teenage wild child Lydia and the second main pair of lovers, Darcy's friend Bingley and Elizabeth's sister Jane.The film does, however, bring out well the comic elements of the plot- I heard far more laughter in the cinema than is normal when costume dramas are being shown. The humour mostly arises from Austen's social satire at the expense of figures such as the arrogant and imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh, well played by Judy Dench as a faded relic of an earlier age, still defiantly wearing in her old age the fashions of her youth, and the pompous and obsequious clergyman Mr Collins (a great performance from Tom Hollander), forever fawning on his patron Lady Catherine. I also liked Brenda Blethyn and Donald Sutherland as Elizabeth's eccentric parents, even if Sutherland's unkempt, unshaven Mr Bennet was not quite how I imagined the character in the book.In all, I felt that this was one of the better Austen adaptations of recent years, on a par with Ang Lee's very different ""Sense and Sensibility"", and certainly better than the rather odd ""Mansfield Park"". 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
An Exuberant Interpretation Faithful to Austen,"""Pride & Prejudice"" is a ""Gilmore Girls"" take on Jane Austen and it is delightful.Much as I loved the BBC's mini-series the last decade and didn't think we could possible need another version, adapter Deborah Moggach (with help from Emma Thompson) and director Joe Wright have shot the story through with adrenaline so that everyone is a lot more lively (with a throw down to the 1940 version as being portrayed by too-old folks and this is the first adaptation where all are the right age). This is a classic personified by emotional people not stuffed icons.While there is too much landscape admiration from the opening dawn on, the crowded Bennet household is immediately captured as filled with five noisy, twittering sisters surrounded by household laundry. This liveliness is particularly noteworthy in the simply danced ball scenes, which are as crowded as a downtown dance club and are brimming with youthful energy and flirtations (this is the first adaptation I've seen that clearly distinguishes between public and private balls in costumes and attitudes). While fully clothed in modest period costumes, the exuberance injects the awareness of bodies as a visual subtext.This constant buzz serves as a marvelous foil for an extremely dour, almost Eeyore-gloomy ""Mr. Darcy"" and serves to emphasize his social awkwardness in situations where every young non-snob is just having a jolly good time. Surrounded as he is by much more amiable guy friends, just when you think that Matthew MacFadyen's ""disagreeable man"" could not possibly appeal to Keira Knightly's live wire ""Elizabeth Bennet,"" he creates sudden sexual tension in the pouring rain at his first, obnoxiously-worded proposal that builds up to a moment as charged as Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed on the phone in ""It's A Wonderful Life."" He later in the relaxed comfort of his own home splits the screen with a warm smile that suddenly makes the viewer (and ""Lizzie"") aware of his beautiful blue eyes, though we don't get to see his sister's startled response to their pre-Spencer/Hepburn competitive raillery.The men are portrayed much more sympathetically and rounded than previous versions, for the benefit of the few guys in the audience dragged by the women in their lives. Though dad Donald Sutherland, barely trying to do a British accent but enjoying not being the villain he's been playing recently, prefers solace with his pigs, oddly, to dealing with his family as much as in his library, his paternal affection clearly comes through and he is more bemused, as in the book, than hen-pecked, as in other adaptations. Though we don't get to hear ""Darcy""s charming soldier cousin's speech about how he needs to marry a woman with money to balance ""Lizzie""s best friend's similar practical analysis, we do see, quite amusingly, just how anxious and nervous both ""Darcy"" and ""Bingley"" are in the presence of the objects of their affections. We are all indeed fools in love.Knightly starts out seeming to be more ""Jo"" from ""Little Women,"" but shines with the fast-paced repartee, especially in scenes where she talks circles around the socially inept ""Darcy,"" let alone his snobby friends and relatives. Her ""gotcha"" scenes of self-realization, however, are less effective than the comparable moments by Emma Thompson in ""Sense and Sensibility"" or ""Gwyneth Paltrow"" in Emma as the director substitutes extensive close-ups for expressions that would communicate her intelligent thoughts. The frequent shots slowly going out of focus, usually to indicate time passing, are also annoying.There is great emphasis on the social satire, with humor from chuckles to laugh out loud funny, propelled by the busy music (which despite the complaints of the woman in back of me was of the period), and the crowded matinée I saw it at the opening weekend responded actively. Tom Hollander is a marvelous ""Mr. Collins"" without making the minister too clownish. Brenda Blethyn brings unexpected depth to the exasperating ""Mrs. Bennet,"" even if her riposte to ""Mr. Collins"" that they can still afford a cook and warning to ""Lizzie"" about just wait until you have five daughters aren't in the book. Dame Judi Dench is in no need of tight close-ups to carry off ""Lady Charlotte"", as she could be imperious to the last row of Giants Stadium, despite a hair-do that does seem more 1970's New Jersey than Second Empire. Jena Malone has a ball in what might be her first period work, even as her rambunctious ""Lydia"" falls to temptation as other characters she has played.Theopulence of ""Darcy""s Pemberley is so staggering that it does make ""Elizabeth"" seem too impressed by his wealth and gives quite a ring of truth to his professed prejudices against her. The opening shot with its lake does tease us about the BBC version as he does not emerge from the lake. It is also a bit obvious to put sensuality forefront to have the mansion filled with voluptuous sculptures rather than the paintings and portrait gallery described in the book.While the erotic mise en scene of the second proposal is more out of Bronte than Austen (my sister-in-law was shocked to see them perambulating outdoors practically in their nightclothes), ""Darcy""s lengthy, open-shirted stride through the mists of dawn practically elicited swoons from the audience.A for some reason U.S.-only coda is completely faithful in spirit to the book, which did not end in the double wedding so frequently falsely portrayed in adaptations, even if the dialog itself, oddly, was not, as there is a parallel interchange that could easily have been used.The great bulk of the dialog throughout the film is directly from Austen, though the writers had to invent romantic dialog where she otherwise dryly says that the couples converse as one would expect those ""violently in love"" to do. And that is the timelessness of this story that this film ebulliently brings to life.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Liked the film's interpretation,"I'm afraid I don't agree with Joejoesan - having seen both, I think the series had its merits and the film is great as a standalone. My friend and I are both big fans of the series although we both agree that Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth were miscast - the first because she wasn't feisty enough and the second because, as all his other roles, he was rather wooden. However, the series as a whole was enjoyable.The film had more impact as we both felt Keira brought the feisty Elizabeth Bennett more to life and Matthew MacFadyen was much more believable as Mr Darcy as you actually saw emotion on his face and heard it in his voice. Of course, he looked like he was suffering from a cold but that could just be wandering around the grassy meadows in the cold, English climate doing that :-)Nothing beats the book of course as you can populate the characters with your own interpretations. I'd like to see the the series re-done with Keira and Matthew in the leading roles (but no wet shirt scene please!). As for kisses - the series only had one itself at the very end and if you watch the DVD/Video you can see how very ... err... unromantic it was and should have been edited out. I think the film didn't need it and, based on viewing the trailer, it probably was there but cut out before the film was released.All in all, I give it 9 out of 10 and would be happy to watch this film again.Tesoro",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
surpasses the 1995 mini series,"Many people seem to have watched this film with the view in mind that the BBC series is the yardstick against which all P&P renditions should be measured. This would be quite wrong. Aside form the obvious flaw of a film not being able to cover as much as a series, there are many flaws in the series which are overcome by this film. The first thing that fans of the series will notice is that the house the bennets live in is far smaller than the BBC's choice. This immediately establishes the social standing and financial position of the family. Secondly the choice of Kira Knightly (isn't she lovely) as Elizabeth Bennet was a far better choice than Jennifer Ehle because Jennifer Ehle was just too darn old! Kira made Elizabeth Bennet seem like the young witty girl who does not think before she humours, where as Jennifer made her seem old enough to know better and rude! But the final usurping moment came from Brenda Blethyn's portrayal of Mrs Bennet. Although it may have been hilarious to laugh at this character in the BBC series, with her flouncing about, getting in a huff about all her girls, and of course screaming 'Oh Mr Bennet!', this extremely unfair to the character, who is quite right! She knows that these girls must all be married or be destitute. They had no inheritance, nowhere to go, and no prospect of sustaining themselves in the late 18th century. Breda Blethyn turns Mrs Bennet from the BBC costume drama clown into a reasonable character. All in all this film far surpasses 'the original' as people see it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Original, unique, and brilliant!","Some great movies it takes more than one time to fully appreciate every aspect of them. Joe Wright's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is original, unique, highly sophisticated, and just remarkably beautiful.Keira Knightley crates a beautiful, naturally charming, and an original version of Elizabeth. Her performance is just flawless. I love her deep emotion, her girlish beauty combines with her tomboyance and the strength of her character. She has really proved herself as a leading lady at such a young age.The cinematography in this film is also brilliant. Yes, this is the film that is worth seeing in theater because it was just so beautifully shot. You will see several shots of country life: grass, mud, rain, animals, farming. You will also see beautiful landscape and sceneries of Lady Catherine's house, Darcy's house, Elizabeth's trip, etc. The whole film is like a series of beautiful photographs, but with much emotion and beautiful music. And don't forget the scenes at the dances where the camera keeps rolling and following the situation without stopping for a second. How brilliantly organized that is and how everybody has to be ready and right on the spot....it was just genius.And yes, the music does so much work in building up the intensity of the story. The dance in the honor of Bingley where Darcy and Elizabeth dance together for the first time started of a bit comedic but ended with an intense anger. Knightley and McFadyen did their best job, but it was the music that builds the tension and releases it.The Bennett family shows an honest relationship. The five sisters give the same vibe you would get from the March family from ""Little Women."" Brenda Blethyn's character may seem like the clown of the story, but in her we see how deeply she cares for her children and we see reasons for her over-the-top action. The film also takes the time to build a relationship between Donald Sutherland and Knightley as a loving father and his most favorite daughter. We see their connection during the scene when they argue, and the scene when she consults her feeling with him. It's deeply moving and touching.And what more can I say that I haven't already? A lot. But I want you to experience the film first. This is a truly great film that deserves much more attention than it has received so far. Jane Austen's fans shouldn't be disappointed, and non-Jane Austen's fans might even want to start reading her works. ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a timeless story and one of the most beautiful and intelligent love story of all time. It's a study of human characters, culturalism, feminism, and romance. And this film does it total justice.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Two stubborn people ...  mad at each other or mad for each other?,"Beautifully filmed, fine attention to detail, subtle musical score, excellent performances, very moving. The hand held camera work is engaging in the festive ballroom scenes and engages the viewer. The lighting is exceptional--from dark candle-lit interiors to the brightness of full sun, the lighting is Oscar worthy. It really brings the reality of 19th century England closer to one's reality and imagination. The film has a somewhat different interpretation than previous versions of the classic novel. Keira Knightley's smile is very engaging. Matthew MacFadyen's performance as Darcy is brooding and understated, but manages to convey the depth of his feelings. I commend the direction by Joe Wright. The English countryside looks lovely as usual. Judy Dench is good, but her presence in every period English movie is beginning to seem a bit cliché. I enjoyed the movie from beginning to end.

Intrigues of Longing,"While some might acknowledge the narrative limitations fallen upon the medium, like the lack of Austen's prosaic descriptions, this movie still is a solid, 2 hour dive into the love intrigues of 19th century British aristocracy.While the love stories might not be immediately captivating and enthralling, they ultimately do get going.The acting, costume work as well as the screenplay is laudable. The music and its main piano motif is splendid.I absolutely loved the witty, eloquent dialogues of the various characters. Hearing people constructing thoughtful and expressive phrases in such a precise and articulate way is such a rarity that it is a pleasure.Additionally, I must say that the movies cinematography offers some impressive and awe-inspiring wide-shots.

"No substitute, but a fun diversion....","I've read the book at least 20 times and I've watched the BBC version many times. I will also confess to fast forwarding (gasp!) through the BBC version once or twice when I craved the joy and beauty of the series, but lacked the time. The movie is obviously missing some of the quirks and characters that I love about Jane Austen's book. However, I am certainly familiar enough with the material to ""fill in the blanks"" that the movie has created. I know Wickhams full story and therefore am not disturbed by the absence of detail in this new version. I enjoyed this movie and found it to be a pleasant and romantic escape from the daily grind. I managed to sneak to the theatre twice to see it and would gladly go again if the opportunity arose. I left the movie smiling with that warm fuzzy feeling, and that was good enough for me.

A brisk romance sure to satisfy,"Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, a novel I wasn't particularly fond of. The movie's characters were well-written and well-performed. Collins is just as awkward and unlikeable as ever, well done. Thee set design and costumes were outstanding as well. However, the film's most striking attribute is its cinematography. The camerawork is very hit-or-miss. Take the Netherfield ball, for example. The camera moves fluidly around the manor, allowing characters to weave in and out of sight. Each individual room is crowded with detail and characters, all vying for your attention. I can't begin to imagine the amount of work this scene must have taken. On the other hand, take the numerous zoom-ins that happen throughout the movie. In such an orderly and proper film, the spontaneous zoom-in feels almost comical, and immediately takes you out of the movie to wonder, ""why did they do that?"" Although they aren't a ""wrong"" artistic choice (they make sense in context), they're executed in such a ham-fisted way that makes it hard not to laugh. Cinematography is important to sell the illusion that you are a fly on the wall. If it's done well, it should make you believe that you aren't just watching a recorded video stitched together. Pride and Prejudice has both magnificent highs and disappointing lows on this front.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Apparently you can ruin Jane Austen,"I was willing to give this new Pride & Prejudice a chance, after all it's one of my favorite books, but I was thoroughly disappointed by this version. Keira Knightly lacked the intelligent spark that makes Elizabeth Bennet one of the greatest characters in literature and instead became a tomboy without extraordinary personality. The Mr. Darcy became a man who was so gosh-darn shy and so gosh-darn boring instead of proud and awkward with emotions. The rest of the cast is pretty good and the cinematography was beautiful, but the two leads made the film painful.

This great rendering of a classical story is an enjoyable treat.,"This movie is a treat from start to end. To have genuine feelings of embarrassment induced by this mere movie made me realize how well the whole charade is actually portrayed. Naturally based on the strong story of the ridiculous attempts to desperately find suitable husbands for a flock of 18th century maidens in a poverty stricken household, it gradually evolves into a tear-jerking tale of indeed pride, prejudice and finally prevailing love and romance. Great hails of praise are to be sounded for Keira Knightley who with the most subtle of gestures conveys her secret feelings to the knowing audience that is sucked into this masterpiece by excellent screenplay and fine outdoor shots that together with the chirping sound of birds makes it gradually become immersed in this long gone world with its feudal tendencies. Since this story had been told so many different times, the outcome to most will not be a surprise, so it is the way in which it is told that must make a difference and indeed this rendering stands out markedly. There's a superb balance between the serious, humorous, grave and light aspects of the story that is never dull with a steady pace. The eloquence of Elizabeth finds a wonderful match in Keira who sets new standards in smart mouthedness compared to previous flicks in which we had seen her. The cast is strong altogether, very well in place, all of them, behold of the fearsome appearance of Judi Dench and the mockery of Donald Sutherland are just examples. Would we like mr. Darcy at a glance with his stiff-upper lip behavior or vouch for the trustworthiness of mr. Bingley with his silly grin? It's all concocted for us to enjoy!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Everything in the film is lively and seems to happen in the most natural way. The initial dancing scenes, for example, give the idea the folks are having real fun - which is quite unusual for a dancing scene playing in upper class England of the end of 18th century (usually they are much more boring).

Both these adaptions are a marvel and a definite collectors item. This one looks like a made of rTV movie. Funny I even wonder if they shot it in English countryside as most scenes kind of make me feel it is the dry American summer in Carolina.

A great date movie for both sexes!,"No ordinary reading of _Pride and Prejudice_ or previous enjoyment of the actors involved could have prepared me for this movie. From the first sequence of Keira Knightley's walk through the yard (reading a book), you are introduced to an England that is lush and fecund. It cannot be denied that here is a movie about growth and passion.Director Joe Wright's first full-length movie shows a fresh eye on the world. He paints with the camera...lush landscapes, the bustle of life in a busy, lower-end genteel home, the cool grandeur of a regal manor estate contrasted with the warmth of a small family room in that manor. Keira Knightley is his muse in this piece and she lives and breathes Elizabeth Bennet. Wright constantly finds new angles to capture Lizzie's emotions. This Lizzie is not proud and cold. She is proud, yes, but full of fire and uncompromising in her choices and passions. Knightley rises above her other performances to give us a Lizzie that hardly dares to dream of finding love in a world that so often pushes us in another direction. One scene, after Lizzie has turned down Darcy's proposal, will haunt the viewer far after the movie is over.This movie is all about passion. The story has been pared down to the essential message of the growth of Darcy's and Elizabeth's love. We see Mr. Darcy's glances and yearning far before he (horribly) expresses his growing emotions to Lizzie. The cast are sublime and passionate - from Brenda Blethyn's gently histrionic Mrs. Bennet to Judy Dench's turn as Darcy's aunt, the esteemed Lady Catherine de Bourg. Strong performances from Americans Donald Sutherland and Jena Malone fit into the English accents swirling around them. I particularly enjoyed Claudie Blakley's performance as the decisive Charlotte, a character that strongly contrasted with her last film role as the defeated Mabel Nesbitt in _Gosford Park_.The movie shows us much about living a shabbily genteel country life as it truly was at the turn of the 19th century. There is no stiff formality in the Bennet family's life; we see geese, pigs and cows living cheek-by-jowl with the humans, raked manure in the yard, careworn walls and doorways. The ballroom sequences involve real elbow-to-elbow dancing, complete with squeals of delight from young girls and the crowded, gossiping audience packed around the dancers on the floor level of the ballroom. The critters are in the yard, the roads are overgrown paths by today's standards, and the castles are magnificent.See this movie if you've ever been in love, wanted to be in love, or wondered what love is all about. See it if you want to see England at her lush, glorious best. This Jane Austen presentation is for all of us, men and women alike; it is not a ""chick flick"". Everyone in the theater was totally enthralled, from the men who were encouraging Mr. Darcy, all the way down to my neighbor's 12-year-old daughter who had just finished reading the book.This may have been the most truly satisfying movie I've seen all year.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

The cast was amazing, yes they didn't portray Mr. Darcy the same way as he's portrayed in the book, but it was still done beautifully and I think along the same thread as the book. I read the book a few years before watching this movie, and it successfully brought back all the wishful thinking and romanticism that the book conjures.

okay if you like this sort of thing,"OK, i went into this movie wanting to not like it. for a start isn't keira knightley just too perfect? and also i'm not he romantic period drama type.But, i have to say i surprised myself. not only did i enjoy the movie but, i actually wouldn't have minded watching it again.As for Keira Knightley, well i have to say its probably the performance of her career so far but, it does leave me wondering when she will get a role that she doesn't stand there pouting most of the time.Matthew MacFadden (darcy) also impressed me but, the whole thing seemed to lack something. however, the TV version with Colin firth did fill all the gaps and left me rather satisfied. the ending on this film left a rather nasty taste, it was all too abrupt but, all in all its a good film and i would recommend it to anyone but, at the same time i would recommend the TV version so that you have something to compare it to.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
You have bewitched me body and soulPride and Prejudice,"Joe Wright's Pride and Prejudice is a truly solid bit of film-making. I can't say whether it is a good adaptation or not, being I have not read the novel nor seen the other film treatments, however, as a piece of work in its own right, it succeeds on all accounts. Gorgeous to look at, this debut shows all the signs of the greatness he was to achieve with this year's Atonement. From multiple long takes, sweeping through the scenery, choreographed to perfection in order to allow the characters to flow in and out of frame, to wonderfully shot dance sequences at the two balls, the craft is unreal. I don't want to knock the story, though, as it is quite good. Never having really taken the time to acquaint myself with the Jane Austen canon, I am pleasantly surprised with how good the tale of love and premature judgments of character is. Firing on all cylinders, I accept all the praise that was lauded on it upon its release fully.Wright seems to have the period drama down to perfection and it will be interesting to see what he does with his new film The Soloist, very much a departure from his two previous works. What we can expect, however, is a precise attention to detail and composition. Throughout this film we are given frames resembling works of art, (not to mention the actual artworks depictedI absolutely loved the marble statue of the veiled woman, breathtaking), with light and atmosphere filling every available space. The little things, like when Elizabeth Bennet is in search of her soldier friend at the ball and we see Mr. Darcy look at her from behind as she continues to walk away, add so much depth with no dialogue necessary. He knows what he wants to show at all times and is never afraid to allow what's on screen do the talking for him through emotions and actions. For a director to trust the craft and the medium at such an early stage of his career, so unabashedly, is a rare trait. Most would rely on his actors to pull out greatness, but instead he relies on no one but himself, and the vision he wanted to put to celluloid.If I were to fault Wright and the film at all, it would be with the handling of some performances, although I'm not sure how much I can really blame. The Bennet family is supposed to come across as loud and obnoxious, a family ill-suited to the status for which they are trying to marry into. They do this in spades, but I may have wanted it to be toned down just a tad. Jena Malone's role as the youngest sister is just plain annoying, but her crassness and lack of subtlety do help in a dinner scene later in the film in order to give her reason to slip and tell her sister a secret. Brenda Blethyn, as the Bennet matriarch, is also very over-the-top. The performance could be a bit grating at times, but thankfully we are given lengthy reprieves without her to allow us to handle those moments when she is in full force.The rest of the cast is absolutely fantastic. Keira Knightley, as she did in Atonement, really surprised me again with her starring role as Elizabeth. She is an actress that finally has deemed herself to deserve the accolades she receives in my mind. I understood people's fascinations with her looks (although maybe not in total agreement), but never the skill at her craft. Now, though, I am on the bandwagon. Mr. Darcy, our second lead, is brilliantly portrayed by Matthew Macfadyen as well. His transformation from stuffy aristocrat to enraptured slave to love is believable at every turn. Despite his burgeoning love, he was still trying to be true to himself and his friends when he gave advice on matters such as marriage. It takes the events between he and Elizabeth for both to realize their own fallibilities and stubborn pride. Only when they finally open up to each other and tell of what the other doesn't really know do they see that what they thought were good intentions were in actuality poor judgments. A good supporting cast bolsters these two stars too, with acknowledgements going to Rosamund Pike, Donald Sutherland (a wonderful final scene), Simon Woods, and the always-great Tom Hollander.For all those that decide to pass by Pride and Prejudice because it is a romantic fluff piece, I only have to say give it a chance. As far as drama goes, the story is well told, and as far as cinematic excellence, it delivers at every moment. I won't go on record and say that it must be the best version of the classic taleI'm always told the Colin Firth piece is betterbut I will say that this is one heck of a film. See it for the grandeur and the spectacle, but also become engrossed in the tale and the journey that love takes these two very different people on showing them and us how very much the same they are.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Probably one of the most sound films ever.,"I have watched a lot of movies and would consider myself (opinion only) an expert on good movies and acting. This movie was brilliantly directed, cast, and acted by all parties involved. Thinking back on this film I cannot recall one flaw. A literal perfect rendition of an amazing book. K. Knightley is well on her way to being the next big thing in Hollywood. She shows off her acting chops here in what should earn her at minimum a Best Actress nod. Donald Sutherland lights up the screen with his rendition of the always classic Mr. Bennett and should also receive a nod from the Academy. And if the film is not down for Best Picture, I will never watch the Oscars again.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I absolutely loved this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I loved this film. It was so romantic and was shot beautifully. Keira Knightly gave a brilliant performance as Elizabeth Bennet. I wouldn't be surprised if she was nominated for her work for the Academy Awards. Another person that impressed me was the man the played Mr. Darcy. He definitely did the character justice. I saw the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice and always thought that Colin Firth was the best Mr. Darcy, until now. This new guy was so good. I sat there at the end of the movie and couldn't believe what a great movie I saw. The chemistry between the two of them was mesmerizing. I can't even explain how good this movie was. I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves romance.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Really great movie,"I just finished watching the movie about 20 minutes ago and already i want to see it again! It was a fantastic representation of the book, very true to the book as well (for all you Austen fans). Knightly and Macfayden have really great chemistry and both acted really well. Malone was also a scene stealer as the bubbly yet sometimes annoying Lydia Bennet. But all in all the movie was very romantic and witty, with some very amusing parts. Macfayden was a very good Mr.Darcy (it's hard filling Colin Firth's shoes!), with the same broody and proud attitude there should be. I really do recommend this movie to anyway who likes a romantic and happy ending, or if you enjoy Austen's novels, because there were very few differences from the novel.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great,"As a real fan of the novel and of the BBC TV series, I went into the theater totally expecting to be disappointed by this movie. But I came away thinking that this movie is just as good, in it's own way. The shorter format made it accessible to a wider audience. Loved the period change (earlier, right?). Loved Knightly as Elizabeth.The only complaint is that they made Mr. Darcy a bit of a lovesick puppy. Where are his struggles? Oh, and what's with the marble statue scene? I thought the man was supposed to have good taste!This is a much earthier interpretation and I think it gained a lot by it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Breathtaking in More Ways than the Obvious,"Yes, a 10. In the grand tradition of Merchant-Ivory, this movie measures up. What a treat! Brilliant+ cinematography, acting, sound, costumes and music. I was captivated by the breathtaking landscapes and the convoluted relationships, and not in that order. Seeing, hearing and feeling that era's range of emotion, intellect, risk, reward and wealth, creates for all the senses a modern-day cornucopia. Sometimes I was almost sure I could smell the food at table. If you saw the film, this minute can you see that large bowl of parsley potatoes? Amazing lensmanship. All those birds and livestock! Perhaps the food and animals stand out because I saw the film the day after Thanksgiving, which was perfect timing for such a film. It was indeed a film about giving thanks. Already I have recommended the film to seven or so friends, and 24 hours have not passed. I'll see in again on the big screen, and I'll purchase the DVD. As I'm writing, I'm seeing the film roll in my mind's screening room. Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I so wanted to like this movie,"Keira Knightley is just plain horrible as Elizabeth. Yes, she's pretty but her Elizabeth struck me as shallow, silly and selfish. I never once believed she was someone Darcy would be ""bewitched"" by. I couldn't wait for the movie to end. I started seriously checking my watch at about the one hour and twenty minute mark. Beautiful footage of the countryside is not enough to carry a film. Too bad. This is usually such a great story. I would like to see Matthew MacFadyen in something else though. He looks like he might be interesting. Anyone have any suggestions? As for the Americanized ending - I'd hardly call it romantic. Awkward was more like it. Some things are better left to the imagination.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Pleasantly Surprised; a star is born in Keira Knightley,"The 1940 version of ""Pride and Prejudice"" has always been one of my favorite movies, despite the M.G.M. hokum, due to the great performances of Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. However, I don't generally like English-themed costume dramas of the Masterpiece Theatre mode -- the last one I can think I liked, aside from Roman Polanski's ""Tess"" (decidely not a M.P.T. production) was Ang Lee's 1995 ""Sense and Sensibility,"" due primarily to the acting. I didn't expect much from this (it was the only movie playing when I was visiting Peterborough, New Hampshire), but I was very pleasantly surprised by the film.What struck me, aside from Keira Knightley's performance, was that for once, the actresses playing the roles of the Bennett sisters/Austen heroines were age-appropriate. The sisters even looked like sisters in this production. I found the acting to be good (if not as satisfying as that of Thompson, Alan Rickman, Tom Wilkinson and Kate Winslet in the '95 S&S, though Donald Sutherland gave a pleasing performance that should have won him an Oscar nomination) and the interchanges between the characters (and the ensemble acting) to be very well-directed. The detailing of the period seemed to be spot on also. The presentation of the story, though highly familiar, never lagged but propelled forward in a fine, natural rhythm. It was a very good movie-going experience.What I wasn't counting on was the star power of Keira Knightley. At this stage in her career, she is a good though unspectacular actress (though it certainly would surprise me if she didn't develop into a very fine thespian in the near future as she gains more experience), but most importantly, she has a real STAR presence. She DOMINATED the movie. They say that a good actor must have good eyes, that the ability to express oneself on screen comes from the eyes. Knightley certainly does have good eyes. In fact, she has spectacular eyes, warm and luminous eyes that are incredibly expressive.Keira Knightley has a beautiful face (though an immature, that is, undeveloped body, but it helps in this film as it bolsters her youthfulness), but beyond her physical beauty, she projects a true inner beauty. (Some actresses can be technically beautiful, but lack an inner warmth that is the root of true beauty. Some women not so pretty have that warmth that makes them beautiful.) Knightly displays a warmth that animates her face and that radiates on screen. What a remarkable gift, and it was most pleasant to experience.I believe that this woman is going to be a major star soon and that her star will shine for generations. She reminds me of a young Julie Christie in the uniqueness of her presence and gift. Keira's acting will improve (as gains more control over her instrument), but her starpower -- something that cannot be learned, but simply is -- is in full-flower right now. Go see PRIDE AND PREJUDICE and you'll agree with me!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
amazing movie love the book love this movie,"I have read all works by Jane Austen, over and over. Of course my most favorite is Pride and Prejudice, and i have seen every movie option available. I went to see the new version, and was in awe, it was AMAZING. the actors did an amazing job, the music was a perfect fit, and the background was perfect, it gave no life to the book, and in my opinion made it more enjoyable for people who didn't enjoy the book. This is officially my FAVORITE MOVIE. I did find some errors in wardrobe, but they can be easily overlooked. I was skeptical about the new Darcy, before viewing. After seeing the movie, i can only say Bravo. He gave the character his bit of mystery, and withdrawn personality. Though it wasn't hard to believe he was a good guy whom everyone could fall in love with. This is definitely a movie to see. Don't you worry I'm buying it the moment i get the chance.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's All Good,"I came to the movie theater with much anticipation, having not remembered earlier versions with the same title, not because I didn't see them, but just because they weren't, in my opinion, very memorable. Prior to watching the movie, I was also upset that one leading critic did not like the movie, while his partner, of reputably greater notoriety and accomplishment,(in my opinion)liked the movie and especially Keira Knightley's performance as Liz. I am happy to say, I recommend the movie on all fronts.I do not take issue with aspects of the film, which were purposely staged(to me). Among those issues were the writers pension to make the film a coming out for Knightley by giving her a plethora of one-liners, an untimely proposal, and Liz's double drubbing of Lady Catherine, perfectly played by Dame Dench, which decorum would have hardly stood for in that day (the book was a bit more delicate, appropriate to the times). Why do I excuse these annoyances (as I would call them)? Simply because the actors and actresses make this move a memorable one, one fitting to the story told by Austen.Staged or not, Knightley delivers an exciting, mesmerizing performance, which certainly sold me on true emotions. I must say there is one disappointment near the end of the film, which, in my opinion, keeps the film from being even better.Kudos to McFayden (who provides one GREAT entrance), Sutherland for a flawless scene with Knightley, and Rosamund Pike, who plays Liz's sister Jane, for delivering a refreshing version of a worn-out, antiquated line, in addition to playing ""up"" to her role in the movie.In the end, there is much pride with little prejudice, as this viewer sees it. That makes two wrongs in a row for one half of the critic's film making version of the dynamic duo.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the best stories of all time.,"This film is one that will be timeless. I had to read the book Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin in high school and I hated it. I thought that it was horrible to read. It was hard for me at the age of like 14 or 15 to really grasp the beauty of the story. Now that I have grown older I decided that I would give the story another shot by watching the film. Mostly because Keira Knightly is one of my favorite actors. It was such a good display of the story that it changed my mind. I think that the tag line for this film (I don't know it word for word) that says sometimes the one you hate is the one you can't live without, is a great one line summary of the story. You feel for the young Liz as she wonders through life trying to find that great love. Not realizing that the man she and you have grown to hate is her destiny.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Utterly charming and beautiful to watch!  Loved it!,"I loved the 1995 version of Pride and Prejudice and cannot tell you how many times I have watched it, so I wasn't sure how I would receive this new version. I found it utterly charming and just beautiful to watch. I loved how it took a different approach with many scenes from the 1995 version. Joe Wright has directed it beautifully - the opening scenes where it meanders through the Bennet house and the ball at Netherfield are a delight. I thought Keira Knightley made Lizzie her own and Matthew MacFayden as Mr. Darcy is brilliant. I wasn't sure about him at first but he really grew on me at the film progressed. He has very expressive eyes! The rest of the cast are also a delight especially Donald Sutherland as Mr. Bennet. I have to admit that I have now seen the movie twice and I enjoyed it even more the second time. Can't wait for the DVD!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wow....!!!,"Do yourself a favor. Watch with your significant other. This is Just a FANTASTIC movie at all levels. Extremely entertaining (NO LULLS) Smart script. Incredible cinematography great acting and story. Draws you in and doesnt let go until its over.It comes loaded with all of the old school grace and charm that is lacking in our society. As an example one scene where Mr. Darcy is helping Lizzie into her carriage he gently guides her hand as the camera zooms in on their hands and then backs off to Mr. Darcy walking away then zooms in to him extending his fingers showing the effect just her touch had on him. Another Scene Lizzies sister is wearing a sheer white dress to a ball and her love interest walks up behind her and for a split second grasps the dress material between his thumb and forefinger. We get the point. He is mesmerized by her presence.I would be remiss if i didnt mention the FLAWLESS character of Lizzies father Donald Sutherland. His role as father to several daughters is amazing. Especially the relationship between him and Lizzie, his obvious favorite. Any father who has daughters will totally relate.One complaint. The old english verbiage is so pedantic that i like to watch with subtitles to understand - ""what they hell did she say??10 stars for sure and BRAVO !!!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"The film, while lovely to view, departs dramatically from Austen's novel.","While the new Pride & Prejudice film is gorgeous to view, and the soundtrack is lovely, we are not seeing Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. The film is for some reason set back in the early 1790's, rather than the Regency period where the novel is set, as scholars have long shown. The Bennets' Longbourn estate is ram-shackled and looks like Cold Comfort Farm. Yet the Bennets in the novel are gentry class; they own a farm, but the pig does not walk through the house, nor is the farmyard of manure and chicken droppings contiguous to the home. Scenes are re-set from the novel,and lest we forget, Jane Austen placed scenes in certain locations for a reason. For example, the film puts the big Darcy proposal scene outside in a storm in front of a Neoclassical temple, as opposed to inside the Collins' parsonage: Why did Jane Austen put it in the parsonage? Because while Lizzy and Darcy speak with total, if brutal honesty to each other in this scene, the Collinses have never shared an honest word. Why the rain and the outdoor proposal? It looks like Jane Eyre meeting Rochester! And when Elizabeth walks across a windy field to stand on a cliff and view the panorama, one expects her to cry, ""Heathcliffe"" at any minute! Austen has been Bronteized! Judy Dench is a GREAT actress, but Lady Catherine is supposed to be tall and striking. The petite Tom Hollander is a brilliant actor: but Mr. Collins is described in the novel as tall and heavy-looking, which suggests that his terrible dancing with poor Lizzy is elephantine. Matthew MacFayden is another favorite of mine from MI-5 on A&E; in P&P, however, he is more the young Heathcliffe, never smiling--though Austen observes in the novel that Darcy smiles at Lizzy quite a bit, and she realizes this when she sees his wonderful smiling portrait at Pemberley--a portrait that in this movie is for some reason replaced by a sculptured marble bust.And much of Austen's dialogue is changed to modern speech. Mr. Bingley has been turned into such a clown that one wonders why Darcy would have him as a friend and why Jane Bennet would love him. The bottom line is that while this is a great movie to watch and hear, it deviates from Jane Austen's novel so much that any student who watched it, thinking she could substitute viewing for reading, would fail!",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

Wonderful; Highly Recommended,"My daughter (age 19) and I loved this movie when we saw it the first time, and we loved it even more when we saw it again, the very next day! And, we can't wait to see it again as soon as she comes home from college for Christmas break.This is a delightful, joyful movie, not ponderous as some period movies can be. Even the costumes and hairstyles were not overdone. Most of the actors did an excellent job.* However, to me, the movie belongs to Keira Knightley who was captivating and wonderfully conveyed Elizabeth's intelligence, spirit, and humor. In the book, Darcy's admiration of Elizabeth's ""fine"" eyes was often mentioned. He referred to their expression, color and shape. Keira's eyes are so beautiful and expressive that it's hard to take your own eyes off of her when she's on the screen.At first, I thought Matthew MacFadyen was too stiff as Darcy, to the point that he seemed to have no personality; but my opinion improved as the movie progressed, and especially during our second viewing of the movie. Note: To catch a glimpse of Darcy's rare and gorgeous smile, be sure to watch the scene when Darcy is introducing Elizabeth to his sister.This is a wonderful movie.* (one exception was Carey Mulligan who played Kitty Bennet; I thought she overdid the gigglingwhich may have been faulty direction, rather than faulty acting).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
No stuffy BBC period piece!,"Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice has been voted the most romantic book of all time. This latest film adaptation of the literary classic features Keira Knightley in her Oscar nominated role as Elizabeth Bennet, the strong willed heroine who would not settle for anything less than love in a time when women had to marry to attain for themselves and their family financial security. Love was considered a luxury. She is put off by the seemingly proud, wealthy and obstinate Mr. Darcy, who constantly surprises her as the story unfolds. Donald Sutherland plays the doting father wonderfully and Keira radiates from the screen in this fresh, hip, charming romantic film that is in no way a stuffy BBC period piece!

Terrific new version,"Although I loved the BBC version, mainly because of Colin Firth's performance, I think this one is even better. The earthy Bennett household with its anxious, flowsy mother, the crush of people, the indolent, long-suffering father, and the narrowness of life in this cash-strapped provincial backwater are wonderfully well caught. We can totally understand why Lydia is so desperate for adventure and escape, and why the girls are all so obsessed with the search for a husband and some romance. The absolute imperative of making a good marriage is communicated with unsparing sharpness of focus; Charlotte Lucas, in announcing her engagement to Lizzie, has a wonderful cameo scene in which she tartly corrects Lizzie's romantic notions with a heavy dose of practicality and realism, and then goes on to touch our hearts with her warm-hearted pleasure, once married, in having her own room in which to receive her friend. The two dance scenes - the Assembly and the Ball - are spectacular, bursting with the energy, vitality, and - dare I say it - good nature that thrives under the class-ridden surface of English life, and which is so often obscured by too great a focus on the surface gentility of the period. A corner of Chatsworth House in the Peak District becomes Pemberley - too grand, perhaps, even for Darcy, but a breathtakingly beautiful setting, and Keira Knightley's moment on top of a rock on the moors wonderfully symbolizes Lizzie's yearning for a larger and freer life. Plenty of other viewers have commented on the casting and camera work: I must add my vote to those who - despite still mourning the loss of Colin Firth - find the new Darcy an appealing replacement. His is a performance that grows on the viewer: I saw the movie twice, and found myself noticing a myriad of subtleties in his realization of the role the second time around that I had missed the first time. The ending - although absolutely not Jane Austen - is tender and moving, and is a wonderfully effective conclusion to a great new adaptation.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
AWFUL! I suggest you watch the TV mini series for the actual feel..,"I was absolutely looking forward to this film.. I was looking forward to Donald Sutherland and Brenda Blethyn, had never heard of Matthew Macfayden and thought that Keira Knightley could never pull this one off...Well after the first twenty minutes, I had been curling my toes, knocking about my knees and yawning... I did not feel the passion Darcy had no charisma and Keira Knightley always had a blank expression on her face that meant no character build up..What a waste of money and script.. Austen must be really shaking her bones at this one...If you are a Austen fan and want to watch the film and RELIVE the story then stick to the TV mini series (1995) .. you can buy it on DVD, after seeing this I bought it straight away... Colin Firth is the one and only Darcy, the mystery the charisma, the sexiness, huskiness can only have been COLIN FIRTH... and as for Miss Bennet the childish charm, the freshness and the genuine character was played by Jennifer Ehle..Conclusion is... forget paying to watch this version... save your money for the popcorn and tortilla crisps and stay home for the TV mini series..

I've seen all of Knightley's movies and I'm convinced her performance in this was one of the best she may ever do.

Amazing,"This adaptation was amazing! They did such a great job staying true to the book. Of course they had to cut some scenes, but they did so very taste fully. Also the way the director moved the film along was brilliant. The ball scenes make me wish that todays culture was the same, dances would be far more enjoyable.The only thing I have to say against the movie is that Wickham was still too likable even after the viewer discovers the truth. Though the rest of the characters were very well casted.I encourage everyone to see this movie, it is just as good as the older version with Collin Firth.

Great Movie,"Stories like this just don't happen any more in a time where there's so much fuss about body attributes and looks in contrast to inner values and character. From their first meeting, and driven by the course of events, Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy each outgrow their disposition - Elizabeth rises from playful, superficial adolescence to a profound, impressive young woman while Darcy descends from haughtiness to noble decency. This prototype of romance is rather triggered by fresh dialogs than mutual desire. Darcy is initially attracted and confused by Elizabeth's spontaneity, by her ability to dumbfound him who considers his views so concluded that he is rather bored by the social activities around him. Till the end they never kiss, they almost never touch each other except for dancing or helping her on a coach. And still, the air between them is more and more filled with romance.The movie paints a picture of an 18th-century family in a society where the only adequate aim for a young woman was to marry advantageously, Elizabeth being kind of a heroine because of her free, open mind so unbending to authority. The original novel by Jane Austen is rather truthfully adopted with some restrictions due to the inevitable bit of director's / scriptwriter's dramatic freedom; e.g. the book has no such scene where Darcy approaches her through morning fogs - well that's just good old Hollywood, a little dip of romance here and there, but (imo) tolerable as it rather decorates the original plot instead of altering it.Conclusion: if you're a romantic who likes such settings, this one is for you. Jane Austen fanatics might take exception to a few details left out or filled in, though.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the most emotional movies out there.,"I won't try to review this movie. I will just write about the impression it left in me. Simply put, I felt deeply affected. It's something about the atmosphere. Something about the way the beautiful country scenery is combined with awesome music that almost makes you fly. And in the perfect harmony with this artistic environment are the actors who create the effect only the end of the 19th century could produce with all its pride and prejudice. If I were to compare it to other movie, I would certainly choose Forrest Gump. Though the setting and plot is completely different, there is the same gentle humor and feeling in both of them that fills one with delight. So if you are not afraid of an emotional tide this motion picture brings then there's no excuse for not seeing it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very Disappointing!,"This is a dreadful and dreary rendition of a splendid and cherished classic.The photographer seemed not to be able to give his viewer the whole scene, but rather one boring close-up after another forcing his viewer out of the story. Numerous lines were mumbled and spoken by actors or actresses with their backs to their audience. The close-up of the heavy balls of the pig gave the final credence to my decision that the production was a poorly made sham of Austen's beautiful story.It appeared that the director and photographer were attempting to show off themselves rather than Austen's timeless tale.The A&E production with Colin Firth is far, far superior to this D-grade attempt at this classic.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
My Own Humble Opinion/Review,"So, I just saw this movie tonight. I must confess I have been waiting for it ever since I heard it was being made. I have come to truly admire Keira Knightly as an actress and was keenly interested in seeing what she would bring to the role of Lizzy Bennett. Also I was much concerned to see who could dare to step into the shoes Colin Firth so romantically filled 10 years ago. I was not disappointed.After holding my breath for the first few minutes, terrified that Knightly's Lizzy might be a bit too ""giggly,"" I soon relaxed and settled in to a refreshing interpretation of the classic story. Knightly provided the anticipated spark needed to truly bring Lizzy to life, while Matthew MacFadyen's brooding stares by no means fell short in affecting his own version of Mr. Darcy. A well-assembled supporting cast, including Judi Dench and Donald Sutherland, certainly aided the two in bringing the story to life.As for the story itself, there are some things that are just a bit out of line, but nothing more serious than: some dialog switches (some characters saying what others said in the book), the complete absence of Mr. and Mrs. Hurst, some changes of scenery for some scenes (instead of the parlor, Mr. Darcy first proposes in the rain, for instance). Other than that, it stuck VERY close to the book. I was actually quite surprised.My biggest complaint with the movie lies with the portrayals of Mr. Bennett and Mr. Collins, and mildly so with Charlotte Lucas. The character of Charlotte is not nearly as pragmatic as Austen wrote her to be, and this I found lacking.Mr. Collins is not nearly as simpering with regards to the great Catherine de Bourg as I would have hoped, nor is he nearly as ridiculous in character as to warrant Lizzy's reaction when he proposes marriage.I was most disappointed in the projection of Mr. Bennett. While I would by no means call him the ""comic relief"" of the novel, his general lack of gravity in the situations Mrs. Bennett gets so worked up over is a large part of what makes the family interaction so likable. Here, though, he is entirely too serious; even his attempts at sarcasm come across as worry. This, I feel, detracts from his relationship with Lizzy and deprives audiences who are new to the story of a vital element of lightheartedness.The storyline itself was quite abridged, but then that's only to be expected. The BBC had the advantage of making a TV miniseries and could, therefore, put much more page-by-page material into the 1995 version. This one, however, had to fit Hollywood's 2.5 hours or less mantra, so it did run a little fast, but an audience member who had never been exposed to anything remotely ""Pride and Prejudice"" before could not get lost in the story despite the editing.Overall, I feel it's definitely worth checking out. Keeping in mind that this review comes on the heels of having not only just re-read the book in anticipation of the movie, but also on having just seen the 1995 BBC version just yesterday.KBD",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great, Romantic movie!","I thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation of Pride & Prejudice. I went to the movie not having read the book for over 20 years, but hoping I would enjoy the plot line and characters nonetheless. I was not the least bit disappointed.The filming was beautifully done, from the first few scenes when Lizzy is walking back to her home. The scenery is lovely and the disparity between the rich and poor is conveyed clearly by the stature of their homes & yards.The music is lovely, the acting is superb, the interactions & conflicts between Darcy and Lizzie memorable.All in all, it's a wonderful story and a joy to sit through. Like many others, I wish the movie had been longer if only to prolong the feeling you're left with as the movie culminates.If you like period romances like ""Emma"" ""Sense & Sensibility"" ""Shakespeare in Love"" ""Ever After"" & ""Little Women"", you're sure to enjoy ""Pride and Prejudice"".And, by the way, the pig scene is so innocuous I have no idea why so much has been made of it...

Mr. Collins, Mrs. Bennet, Mary Bennet, and even Lady Catherine are more fully realized than in previous versions. Jane Bennet is reserved just we would hope, and Georgiana was a wonderful 15.

"Phenomenal Production, But Certain Characters Fall Short","I decided to read the book first before watching this movie. The book was an incredibly entertaining read, and as with most books, leaves you with impressions on how you think the characters should act and look and behave. I came into watching the movie with these characterizations in my head, and for the most part, the movie lived up to my expectations. Elizabeth Bennet was just as I pictured in the book, along with her sisters and the rest of the Bennett family. Perfect casting in my opinion, perfect acting, the females in this film embodied the spirits of the characters in the book.My qualms come with the males cast in this film. Starting with Mr. Bingley, I thought they made him look much weaker and much dumber/ more awkward then he appears in the book. In the movie, he's sort of stumbles over his words, seems sort of shifty, not too confident, whereas in the book I pictured him as being confident, yet ambivalent, somebody whose mind is easily changed. I think they could've done a better job of showing this versus making him seem like in awkward/bumbling good hearted young man.Next, I had a different picture of Mr. Collins. In the book, I pictured him as a larger, more foreboding figure, but somebody who is incredibly officious and overly polite, as an example, somebody who apologizes frequently out of a sense of propriety as he behaved in the book. The cast in the movie made him seem too serious, too prickly, almost making him out to be the bad guy, where in the book I think it was not such a characterization -he is a victim of the culture and behaviors that are common place for males of this time.Finally, mr. Darcy. I thought Matthew McFadden was the perfect embodiment of his appearance, however I thought he could've done a much better job of playing his character. I pictured Mr. Darcy as much more charming, much more confident, more conviction, more articulate... really somebody who was proud, who is proud with a sense of conviction, yet also a sense of charm. McFadden's performance in the movie comes off as sort of a character who is reserved, detached, broody,... almost a little awkward and shy, which like Mr. Bingley, I think is an ill conceived portrayal.TLDR, phenomenal production and cinematography, casting and acting performances I would have done differently.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Blood, Death and Gore.","This movie is tainted by the death of innocents. Many rabbits were murdered specifically for this movie. They would have lived on in the wild unmolested and free, had it not been for the evil of the production company responsible for 'Pride & Prejudice'.Their selfish, uncaring desire for 'realistic props' is why the cartload of dead rabbits (as seen in this movie) actually is a cartload of dead rabbits.I live near to where this movie was shot and I have spoken with an extra from the film who has confirmed the above harrowing fact.The behaviour of these movie makers is disgusting.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Regency Rom Com.,"PRIDE AND PREJUCIE is a lovely English movie that is immaculately written,shot and acted. It takes Jane Austen's 18th century novel and turns it into a Regency Rom Com for a 21st Century audience.The plot revolves around the Bennett household in the late 18th century English countryside. Women had no role in that society then other than as wives and mothers. So the Bennet girls need husbands -particularly the headstrong and independent Elizabeth (Kiera Knightly). The story charts her relationship with Mr Darcy (Matthew MacFaddyen), who seems initially humourless and unapproachable - but also very rich.The film opens on sunrise and twittering blackbirds in the English countryside and from then on the English countryside has never been this beautiful since FAR FROM THE MADDENING CROWD (It was shot entirely on location at various stately homes and houses in Kent, Derbyshire and Lincolnshire, with no studio work)The other standout are the performances, which are uniformly good. Even the small roles - check out the way Tom Hollander makes the most of every moment as Reverend Collins. But at the centre is Kiera Knightly, who illuminates the screen like no other actress since Gwyneth Paltrow first appeared in EMMA, a decade ago.The cinematography, art direction and costumes are exquisite. Best of all, Joe Wright's direction feels confidently cinematic (look at the use of a Steadcam shot capturing moments at the ball). The film is lighter and more cinematic than Ang Lee's soporific 1995 SENSE AND SENSIBILITY (which got by on good acting and a charming script).",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
firth v macfadyen,"i really liked this movie.Matthew macfadyen has done an awesome job playing D'Arcy, and that is saying something when you've seen Colin firth's portrayal and think that no one else could do it justice as well as kiera knightly, i really didn't think she could pull it off..what is surprising to me is that i never once , while watching this movie, compared the firth/macfadyen--ehle/knightly portrayals..i just loved to watch them both..you could see the attraction between the 2 main characters almost from the start..in some ways i'm more in love with this version..i think macfadyen's portrayal of D'Arcy is more tender and seemingly heartfelt..and kiera knightly's portrayal was just the right amount of spunk for Elizabeth..the entire cast was perfect in this movie even Donald Sutherland's portrayal of Mr. Bennett. i am very glad i have added this movie to my collection and that my son insisted in taking me to the threatre to this version of the movie. i hope to see more from all these fine actors in future.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Good Version of a Classic Story,"I enjoyed this movie, Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice is a masterpiece with a plot and dialog that will live forever. The director, Joe Wright, used the camera imaginatively and most of the outdoor scenes made excellent use of the beautiful English countryside. The film moves with pace and the way the characters interact seems very modern, they just happen to be dressed in period costume. Deborah Moggach's script incorporates most of the dramatic set pieces and the memorable one-liners from the book. It's a bit like a greatest hits compilation.Keira Knightly's Elizabeth is beautiful, charismatic and full of life, making Darcy's attraction easy to understand. Matthew MacFadyen's Darcy is a shy man unwilling to let his emotions show. He seems drawn to Lizzie's confidence, vitality and sense of fun. He initially appears haughty and arrogant but his later good deeds, humility and wealth play a part in winning Lizzie over. Darcy is a difficult part to play but MacFadyen does a good job.Donald Sutherland plays Mr. Bennet like a stoner with a sense of humor. Rosamund Pike is a very pretty Jane. Brenda Blethyn's portrayal of Mrs. Bennet is perhaps too sympathetic. Tom Hollander is excellent as the awful Mr. Collins. Judi Dench was a little disappointing as the battle-axe Lady Catherine de Bourg. Mr. Wickham hardly makes an appearance in this version - probably not enough time.On balance, I preferred the 1995 five-hour BBC version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. It had more time to let the characters develop and it focused on the marvelous dialog. This shorter compressed version is first-rate and has a strong visual style but if you came to this fresh without knowing the story you might wonder what all the fuss was about.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Greatness in 2.5 hours!,"OK, I've seen and read just about everything there is done from or by Jane Austen and I just have to say that this movie makes me ...happy. I know that it doesn't quite compare with the 1995 - Colin Firth - version, but for a 2.5 hour version it comes close. I was really weary of any remake of something that didn't really need fixing, but never-the-less, this version still had me rooting for it at the end. The music and scenery in this movie come together to give it the right ""feel"" of the romantic story and that is saying something because I am rarely ever happy with the music of a movie. Even if you go into this movie expecting not to like it you will come out of it with at least a respect for it if not a love for it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
By far the worst remake of this beautiful classic story,"I have seen the original and every remake of this classic tale, as it is my favourite period drama, and this must come top at being the worst yet and in the 21st century surely the film industry is capable of much better.Beautiful scenery, accurate costumes and pretty actors do not make a film great. This remake failed completely to build any of the characters, to really show the early animosity between Elizabeth and Mr Darcy, let alone give reason for it. There was little to show the terrible plight that the youngest daughters elopement brought on the family or the importance of Darcy's help, in fact the whole film charged through the story like a high speed train, showing a bit of scenery but not being able to stop long enough to appreciate any of it. The characters were dull and lifeless, I have always felt some emotion, if not quite a bit, watching the films but this gave me nothing at all and I can cry at adverts.I was utterly disappointed in everything about the film and was amazed that they even felt the need to alter the story unnecessarily when there was far too little time in the 127mins to do justice to the story without the improvisation. A complete waist of time and money",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Intelligent, funny, faithful adaptation","This is a very entertaining movie, with engaging performances from all its leads. Jane Austin's wit and social observations are preserved, with some subtle but pleasing modern touches. The camera-work is superb; it is really shown to great effect in ballroom sequences, in which individual characters are in focus across crowded rooms. The atmosphere of the time is meticulously portrayed in various settings, pointing up differences in wealth and social status through many great touches (such as a mature male pig being herded through a house).My only quibble was the sound of a modern grand piano, standing in for older instruments used on camera - I thought the sound editor should have used more authentic-sounding instruments to match the beautiful visual settings.If you like period drama that keeps its sense of humour and remains true to its roots, go and see this movie. Very well done, indeed.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
pride and prejudice film,I did see both the versions of Pride and Prejudice and I must say that they were both good. I saw a comment on here that was very bad on Matthew MacFadyen. I must say that he's a better cast than Hugh Grant as proposed. I think that Matthew didn't get a chance to show the true Mr Darcy as he had to try it in 2 hours while Colin Firth had almost 6 hours. I also think that the film can't be compared to the series. the film is a bit more modern when it comes to the setting and the costumes. I think that they did a great casting in this film. It is always hard to make a remake of something that was a big hit but in my opinion the film makers did a good job with this film. Keira Knightley showed she can carry a film. I loved the small parts from Donald Sutherland and Judi Dench. She is the right person to play Lady Catherine. That Lizzy and Darcy don't kiss at the end didn't bother me at all. I thought it was a lovely romantic version of the novel.,9.0,Anonymous,Romance
A spirited new version of a classic British tale,"Gritty, realistic and brilliantly acted  these are just some of the ways I would describe the new version of Jane Austen's classic 18th century tale.Pride & Prejudice tells the story of a young woman who is stuck in the craziness of her family, culture and era. She is there to see her oldest sister get ditched by the ""perfect"" man. She is there when her younger sister runs away and elopes with the scoundrel of the story. She sees her mother desperately trying to marry off her 5 daughters to wealthy men. She is stuck in a world where people marry for economic and family reasons and the one thing in the world she wants is to marry for love.When the BBC released its mini-series of Pride & Prejudice in 1995, it became the standard from which all classic British stories would have to be filmed. It was plush and beautiful and all the characters looked well-groomed and pretty all the time. That was not England in the 18th century, however.This recent film, starring the young Keira Knightley, will be known for its realistic portrayal of country life in the 1700's. Knightley plays the lead character, Elizabeth Bennet. She comes from a fairly well-off family in the English countryside. She is opinionated, well-read and isn't afraid to speak her mind  in other words, everything a woman should not be in that century. Knightley plays the part brilliantly and you can see both her strength and her vulnerability at the same time. She reaped an Oscar nod for her portrayal and deservedly so.Matthew Macfadyen, as Mr. Darcy, is brooding and silent for a lot of the film. Therefore, when he actually proclaims his love for Ms. Bennet, in the rain on the British moors, he not only shocks and bewilders her, but he causes the viewer to wonder how she can resist him  stubbornness and all.Donald Sutherland as the supportive father is wonderful, and although her part is a small, but pivotal one, Dame Judi Dench plays Lady Catherine de Bourg perfectly.The rainy British weather, the animals in the front yard of the Bennet house, the dirt on the floors and the sisters having to share a bed  all add to the atmosphere of the movie. The clothes aren't always clean, the balls are crowded and uncomfortable and the people aren't always smiling and happy.This movie is realistic and wonderful. It takes you to another place and time. A time when Jane Austen wrote some of the most beloved books about strong female protagonists and the hardships of life and love. Even if Keira Knightley doesn't win the Oscar this year, rest assured, Ms. Austen would have been proud.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
interesting interpretation of Austen Classic,"This is a rather good adaptation of the classic regency novel, with a beautiful soundtrack, stunning scenery and wonderful costumes. Keira Knighley is surprisingly good as Lizzy Bennet, ( I found her unbelievably irritating in the Pirates of the Caribbean films), much more suited in looks, age and manner to the character than Jennifer Ehle in the BBC version. The actor playing Darcy brings the right amount of reserve, arrogance and sexiness to the role, while Tom Hollander is wonderful as Mr Collins. I also enjoyed the rustic and natural appearance of the Bennet home and gardens. Some aspects of the book have been changed but mostly it is a very faithful adaptation. My only criticism is the representation of Goergiana Darcy, very shy and reserved in the book and scarred after her experience with Wicham, in this she is too bouncy and giggly, like another younger Bennett sister. Also, avoid watching the American ending, which is a special feature on the UK DVD version. So glad its only an extra and not our ending, I pity US viewers.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent! This is one to purchase on DVD,"I am a big fan of the Colin Firth version of Pride & Prejudice. The shorter versions have been pretty disappointing, with exception of Bride & Prejudice (which was a charming musical version)and finally this newest film which has proved to be a wonderful rendition of the tale.The story allowed for chemistry, an overall underlying sensuality, and a side of Darcy that was far more vulnerable than previously demonstrated. The way the various scenes were condensed together was done amazingly well. The cinematography was gorgeous.The character of Lizzy was played very well. One of the changes that I was extremely happy about was that her character was more protective of Darcy in the end, rather than allowing her family to speak ill of him.The final scenes were very romantic and packed with emotion and tenderness. It is truly a rare thing these days to have a good love story with a PG rating. About time.This is one of those films that I can't wait to be released on DVD. It will be a romantic great to add to my collection of favorites.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Badly Done Adaptation of Jane Austen novel,"Although by far most of the reviews find this movie great, I found it choppy. I thought the acting was strained at best. The best acting was done by Judi Dench. I thought Donald Southerland made the father seem totally inept, a disservice to the part. To me, if one had not seen earlier versions of the movie or read the novel, they would have had a hard time following the plot. Part of the problem may lie in whoever wrote the adapted screen play. And I also found problem with the film editing. Also, there were a couple of times where the talking was done so quickly (like mumbling) and over music in the background that I could only understand one out of five words.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wondrous Adaptation,"I first heard that this movie was being made about a year ago, when it was first being reported that Keira Knightley had been cast. I had little interest, being only fourteen at the time. The next summer came around and I turned fifteen and still had very little interest, although it was a little more piqued since Pride and Prejudice would be one of the books that I would be reading in my British Literature English course once classes started up in August. After plodding through Jane Eyre (not really to my liking), we reached Pride and Prejudice, and almost from the moment I started the book my interest in the upcoming movie reached a boiling point. I loved the book from start to finish and couldn't wait the arrival of the movie (luckily I only had to wait about four weeks from the time I started the book to the time when the movie came out). In my class we watched the 1965 version with Elizabeth Garvie and David Rintoul, which I thought was very good. In the weeks leading up to the movie's release I greedily watched and re-watched every clip I could find and also rented the Colin Firth version and Bride and Prejudice. I was expecting so much from this movie. November 11 rolled around and I was ecstatic. Well, the movie didn't meet my expectations at all. It more than exceeded them. Pride and Prejudice became my favorite movie of the year and it is definitely in the top ten. I absolutely loved it. I thought Keira Knightley did an excellent job, even if she was a bit too giggly at times. I thought that Matthew Macfadyen was amazing as Mr. Darcy. I liked him better than Colin Firth. The acting was superb and the story was amazing for being condensed by so much. The costumes and cinematography were amazingly done as well. I love the soundtrack, it was so beautifully done. In short, I loved everything about this movie, and it is one that I will watch a million times over.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A wonderful romance,"I'm very surprised at the negative comments re this picture. I have read the original novel several times and have to admit that it was lovely watching the brilliant ""condensed"" version on screen without the windy, tedious and often boring conversations and letters which the characters in Jane Austen's book carried on and wrote. This was ""romance in a nutshell"", the acting was very good (would have loved to have seen much more of Dame Judi Dench), the soundtrack was magnificent. I have the CD and play it very often---Dario Marianelli was robbed at the Oscars! My daughters and I will cherish this film always. We bought it the day it come out on DVD, but I am so glad we saw it on the big screen, too.As for the thought that younger people will not be interested in the original novels once they are brought to the screen, my daughters are so enchanted by this movie, they all intend to read the novel, as well, and they will.How sad that this lovely piece of film-making wasn't even nominated for an Oscar.

Extraordinary,"Wow! I saw this film twice on the second day it was out! I though It was Extrordinary, as I am betting, did the rest of the theater ( which was full for the first and last show of the day) Being brought up on Jane Austen, and losing respect for corporations who make cheap films of her magnificent work, I was a little afraid that this would be the case. The movie definitely has been condensed, but what with a 6 hour mini series, you can understand why. It hit all the main points, and the casting, I must say, was beyond spectacular. The one item that made me question when I heard it was the fact that some of the characters say lines from the novel that don't belong to them. (For example, In the movie, Mary says,""What are men to rocks and mountains?"", when in the novel, Lizzy says that). Other than this, It was splendid. The music is also fabulous, and I encourage anyone to go and see it- Why, at the evening show I saw 6 teenage boys have a thoroughly entertaining experience, and they came on their own to the movie! Amazing! Jane Austen transforms the cynical unromantic and immature boy into a culturally aware man that will know how to treat their dating partner and eventually, wife. I can think of no greater service to mankind!Have a great day, and go see Pride and Prejudice! It is worth every second one fears of wasting.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"As a big fan of the A&E version, I was extremely satisfied!","I'm a huge fan of the mini-series since it aired on A&E 10 years ago. I had doubts about the movie version, first, how can any man redo Colin Firth's celebrated performance? And secondly, would Keira Knightly do justice to Eliza Bennet? And most importantly, how can you enjoy the film without comparing it to the mini-series!? Answer to the first question, is Matthew McFayden did a fantastic job, he's a great and passionate actor. Keira Knightly fit perfectly as Eliza Bennet (and believe me I had doubts), but her performance was outstanding. And lastly: the mini-series. For the first 20 minutes of the film, all I could do was compare every actor, every movement to the mini-series. But then I became so wrapped up with the sensuality of the film, something the A&E/BBC miniseries lacked. Granted, the A&E version is more true to the novel, it also has more room for intelligent banter and novel preservation because it's 5 hours long. Although what the mini-series did lack, was the PASSION! Which this movie exceeds. It is not just a great novel, but it's a love story which the film portrays beautifully. The passion in Eliza's heart and love for Mr. Darcy after realizing his goodness is something that is quite reserved in the mini-series.The film made a great approach in making miniseries fans satisfied by being able to see the passionate and sensual side of Jane Austen and the story.The director's choices were fantastic. We got to almost feel Eliza's character the part where we see the sunlight Eliza sees with her eyes closed. It was a great choice in trying to connect the audience almost anatomically with our protagonist.If you are a big fan of the mini-series, don't be stubborn - you will be pleasantly surprised to see a new side to our favorite Jane Austen couple.FILM: 10/10 DIRECTING: 10/10 PERFORMANCES: 10/10 (although I wasn't really happy with the casting of the Binglys) WRITING: 9/10 ADVERTISING: 0/10 (Consider this movie poorly advertised, especially 2 months before Oscar announcements; shame shame shame)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Easily one of my all time favorites.,"Unarguably the finest love story of all time. The themes and characters in the film are all beautiful and timeless. Joe Wright manages to capture every flawless element of the novel, while making it massively entertaining and creating the best cinematography I've seen in a long while. The gorgeous landscapes mixed with the pouring rain and the entrancing score create an utterly joyous experience throughout. A seamless blend of side-splitting humor, gut-wrenching drama and the most passionate and beautiful romance ever brought to screen. Performance wise the film is just as flawless as the storytelling. Knightley more than deserved her Oscar-nomination, and a win in my books, but the phenomenal work in the acting field doesn't stop there. Everyone from Rosamund Pike to Donald Sutherland and back to Matthew Macfadyen deliver nothing but praise-worthy brilliance. The finale is one of the most joyous, wonderful and simply pleasing experiences of my lifetime. An utter joy to watch, and very high among the best of the decade so far.

As soon as the film had begun and a beautiful piano piece had come on I knew that I would enjoy the movie. The film was shot so beautifully, taking in all the scenery and architecture of the houses. Without needing to include kissing or sex Joe Wright has created such romance and atmosphere that I have never experienced in any other film before. I have read the book and it does explain about the troubles for women back then and also captures the love growing between Mr Darcy and Elizabeth. It creates the story from the book, but maybe not in as much detail, leaving lots of it out, but keeping the most important pieces focusing on the romance and marriage. It has been beautifully filmed and has a pure feeling about it.

"WORST Adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"" in Decades","Between Deborah Moggach's god-awful screenplay and director Joe Wright's dismal vision of a filthy, graceless English upper class, this is the most dismal of the many film versions of Jane Austen's classic since the laughably bad 1940 movie.The Elizabeth Bennett of this movie is a slovenly, thick-headed country bumpkin who eats like a slob, plays the pianoforte like a ham-fisted 5-year-old and has the conversational skills of an autistic teenage boy. She lives in a grubby, falling down hovel surrounded by untended fields, dusty drives and muddy yards filled with free-roaming livestock. Compared to this version of poor Elizabeth, Tess of the Durbervilles was like Marie Antoinette. Elizabeth is not alone in this coarseness, however; director Wright gives us an entire class of people who look more like ragtag medieval peasants than 19th century aristocrats.Do yourself a favor and ignore this travesty. The marvelous 1995 mini-series starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is vastly better in every way, especially its choice of sticking faithfully to Jane Austen's dialogue and plot line, instead of debasing them with a cheesy Hollywood attempt at embellishment.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

Does your heart care what social class you are in?This is a very good and humorous tale.

You may have loved the 5 hour version well good for you a mini series can do that but a movie cant, so don't be mad about that but the idea that Matt days a poor job as Darcy regardless of how boring you may find him or how the mini series was more of what you pictured in your head you have to remember that unlike a book a movie is a representation of what someone else saw in there head while reading this novel if you didn't see the same thing it doesn't make it bad its just different and you need to realize that and respect this movie for Joe Writes pure cinematic genius in his first feature film and Mathew McFadden's ability to play a Darcy that any man can respect. The way he portrays Darcy is beautiful and moving and if you spend the whole time going hey this isn't Darcy well then quite frankly you are wrong because this is Darcy as Macfadyen sees him and not u if you don't like it make your own movie! If you stop comparing this to other Jane Austen attempts maybe you will realize this movie is brilliant, beautiful and moving and the musical background is well picked combined with cinematically stunning concepts to make you really feel the love between these two characters and not some giddy fake or foolish love that you see in society today but a love that seems real, with its problems and its perfection in how chaotic it is that brings anyone male or female to a point at which they long for something so true in there life love or not but something.This is one of the most beautiful love stories ever written and having read the book I consider this a fantastic ADAPTATION! Of a great novel so if you have two hours in your day I beg you to please watch this movie regardless of what the others on this site say about it because you may find yourself filled with a strange yet pleasant emotion at the end of this film that you have never felt before and that's what a movie is suppose to do, combine wonder story with, music that portrays the mood and cinematography that emphasizes emotion in a way that no other medium can.oh and one last thing, they don't kiss on the bridge SO WHAT! a kiss would have been cheese and Joe Wright avoids a kiss intentionally if you listen to the commentary you would know this, you would also know the reason they don't wear bonnets despite the fact that they are mentioned often in the book is because Wright did not feel bonnets would work as well cinimaticaly so stop complaining before u hear his explanations the man is a perfectionist and was not completely satisfied with any scene in the movie and because of that mad something quite nearly perfect.Brian",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The shortest way between two hearts is never a straight line ...,"Most of the delight provided by Joe Wright's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is that the late 18th century material of Jane Austen's celebrated novel is handled with a subtle but imperceptible modern touch.It is as though the heroines were not much different from high school girls of two centuries later, not that the movie was modernized in such a way it betrayed Jane Austen's spirit but in its clearly stated intention to target a younger audiences, it found the perfect note and tone to that, much more with the perfect actresses. It's not even a coincidence that all the plot-driving Bennett sisters are played by future A-list players: Carey Mulligan, Rosamund Pike and last but not least, Keira Knightley. Today, they gathered more Oscar nominations together than Donald Sutherland... in one of his most charming and endearing roles as a father stricken by the blessing (or the curse) of having only daughters.Watching these sisters interact during the film reminded of this cliché of teenage girls gossiping, wondering if the school heartthrob said this or that, or how they can approach him without looking too pushy or needy. It's all the same game in ""Pride & Prejudice"" but it works even better in the film because the stakes are higher than a simple flirt or a date, the film is about marriage and we all know what it meant in the 18th century, for girls as much as men. A man with a profession and a good fortune had to be married, at eighteen, a girl had to find such a man, all she had to do was to be pretty, fertile, other considerations such as wit and personality were more or less important. The point was that anyone with a daughter had to make it a matter of honor to prevent her from being a spinster, Mrs. Bennett (Brenda Betthlyn) had five daughters, so it wasn't a part-time job, she would know no rest before she'd marry the youngest one, and yes, they had to be married in order, in order not to show that one had been passed over.It's a whole marketing process where money was at stakes as well as love matters. With five daughters, only a male distant cousin of the family, the boring Mr. Collins (Tom Hollander) would inherit from the Bennett's landowning fortune. There are parameters to be taken into consideration and urgency is one of them. And the intelligence of the film is not to overdo the 'modernity' card. Indeed, had it ever tried to criticize them indirectly, that would've been too artificially feminist for its own good, but even Lizzie, who is the most free-spirited sister, accepts the obligation of marriage as part of life requirements, because she's also, like any girl of her age, in quest of a true love, and she's not deprived of bad looks. Keira Knightley is perfect with that unique combination of youthful full-bloom beauty, mature intelligence and that cute smile that oddly distorts her lips and shrink her eyes, a sight that melts my heart every time. She's typically the girl any man would fall in lover with, but obviously, she's not for any man. One of the most painful moments is when Cousin Collins, as boring a pastor as vertically challenged, asks her for marriage and she finds the proper words to put him in his place, diplomatic, polite but final.She does so, because if not her heart, her mind is still invaded by the figure of Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFayden) a handsome and smoothly brooding friend of the more sociable and jovial Mr. Bingley (Simon Woods) who just moved next to the Bennetts and seems to have grown a mutual fondness with the older sister Jane (Rosamund Pike). Jane, as a naturally shy girl, doesn't express her excitement enough although she likes Bingley, and at the risk of not appearing needy, she dangerously lets her attitude slide toward a form of cold distance during the crucial ball scene. Meanwhile, a few exchanges between Lizzie and Darcy showed the obligatory dislike at first sight but one of a peculiar sort that can't fool us, it's acted in such a way that we can't believe these two persons aren't made for each other.Interestingly, the growing romance between Jane and Bingley allows Lizzie and Darcy to meet more regularly despite their official façade of animosity. Of course, the romance won't go without a series of misunderstandings, properly set as narrative obstacles, the most memorable involve a dashing young captain named Mr. Wickham (Rupert Friend) in contention with Darcy and a domineering aunt, played by Judi Dench, who has other plans for Darcy. The movie is a powerful illustration that the shortest way between two hearts is never a straight line, but neither the bitchy aunt or the presumptuous captain are as effective antagonists in the film as the titular pride and prejudice, prejudice hurts one's pride and a hurt pride paves the way to prejudice, and most the excitement comes from watching these two hearts trying to get out of that vicious circle...... that, and seeing Mrs. Bennett desperately praising her daughters' charms and virtues as if she was trying to be the saleswoman of the month.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent Acting!!! Beautiful Scenery!,"The first time I watched the movie, I thought it was very beautiful. Then, I actually started watching it over and over, and realized that it was much more than beautiful. The acting is true, shots are so adequate to the scene and so realistic, yet unseen in movies of this kind. The music throughout the movie awakens all of your senses, you can feel every emotion or thought in the scene.Mr. Darcy, portrayed by Matthew Macfadyen, in the beginning, is prejudiced, proud, and ""sort of unpleasant fellow"" in Mr. Bennett's words. Beauty of his personality grows through the movie, as Elizabeth Bennett's love and respect grow for him. Wonderful scene in the rain where he opens up and lets his emotions run, Lizzy rejects him but feels terrible about it...Then, she learns more of his qualities, and she realizes that she loves him and has been falling in love with him this whole time.Wonderful story beautifully told by amazing Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen. I highly recommend the soundtrack!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Realistic,"Once I read in a comment: ""Nobody does Victorian like the Brits"" and I generally agree both in writing and movie-making. Here I was agreeably surprised though by the way they handled Jane Austin's book. I was especially struck by the realism of the costumes, make-up, surroundings and scenery. Most of the time you get the impression that everyone in these movies goes to bed with make-up on and freshly done perms. And what's worse, they get up the same way. Here you get a freshness that we are not used to in Victorian movies.This may have a downside off course. Pride and Prejudice being a love story, everything being clean and beautiful adds to the beauty of that feeling. Fortunately here they managed to maintain the magic of the love story nonetheless. Both main characters Elisabeth and Darcy help us getting in this romantic mood. Whereas the music is the finishing tough as to this mood setting.By making a novel into a movie one always looses aspects off course. The book being filled with information, you'll often get the feeling ""Hey, here they forgot something"". This movie was off course not able to be as complete as for example the 1995 mini series. All energy was put in the main characters Elisabeth and Darcy, whereas other characters are less present. All this does influence the explanation of 'Pride and Prejudice'.But there's only one aspect of the movie that I did not appreciate: the way the Bingly character was portrayed. Bingly is supposed to be a good hearted, well educated, elegant young man worth of the love of the equally elegant and beautiful Jane. Here I get the feeling that Bingly is more of a simpleton then a good hearted guy.Nonetheless this doesn't in any way ruin the movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it is very likely to get into my DVD-collection.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Extremely disappointing,"I love the book and I love the fantastic mini-series (see http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112130/) so I was very much looking forward to this film, especially with Keira being cast as Elizabeth.So much potential and yet such an utter let down.The film was heavy handed, full of fake smiles and screwed up noses from Keira that just grated. Bingley was absolutely horrendous - far too stupid and foppish. Worse still the story was distorted to such an extent that anyone who has read the book must wince and cringe. In fact at points I was quite angry at what I was seeing.Trying to take the film in isolation and remove my disappointment at the terrible things they did to the story line, I think the term that best describes it is ""over-acted"". I was left wondering if this was supposed to be a comedy at times and to be honest it failed dismally as that too - somewhere in-between but not quite either.Hugely disappointing for this Keira and Jane Austen fan.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
The film,"Matthew Macfadyen plays very well his role. I can say that because I've read the book. Of course, it's not as developed as the book but they had only two hours so I think they did a really good job. Matthew Macfadyen is always watching at Elisabeth which is really important. Moreover the story does not change from the book. Elisabeth shows well that she's proud but i think not enough. But in two hours it's difficult to hate somebody and love him after. Mr Wickham is not enough here (even if i hate this man). In the film, we don't really understand why Mr Darcy loves so quickly Miss Elisabeth. It's just because there are some moments that miss. In the book, they see each other a lot more. But the film is really really good we can feel what they feel I recommend it to everybody.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Deborah Moggach,"I love Jane Austin and Have Read her Stories/Books many Times over, So when going to see this version I wasn't expecting much because Hollywood Usually Butchers the Authors Vison when they transfer book to script to movie. I can sum this version in just four words 'THE BEST ADAPTATION EVER' Deborah Moggach adapted Jane Austin Vision to perfection. The cast was Spot on. The Cinematography Makes me want to go to the UK. who ever did the scouting for the locations is a genius. I do have one complaint, Keira Knightly's Costumes made her look like she had a large breast on one side and none on the other. I just love this movie I am going to buy it when it comes in DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A wonderfully accurate portrayal of Jane Austen's story,"As an avid Jane Austen fan, I was both excited and apprehensive at the thought of seeing this most recent film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. I was pleasantly surprised, however, at the accuracy with which much of the story was presented. The costumes, scenery and story were very well done and kept as close to the original as is possible in a film adaptation. My only disappointment was the way the ball at Netherfield was conducted. It seemed too loud and boisterous for such a civilized age and the dancing seemed far too simplistic. The intricacies of dance in that time period served to separate the aristocracy from the rest of society because they were the only ones able to spend time learning intricate dances. I believe that the dances shown were simple enough for anyone to learn, therefore I must question historical accuracy in this case. Overall the movie was a good representation of Jane Austen's work and was very enjoyable.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
unintentionally hilarious,"This gets a three rather than a one simply because I have rarely laughed so much in a film, and believe me, I don't think the director had planned all of those laughs. Whilst this is undeniably a visually attractive film, it comes across as a send up of Pride and Prejudice rather than a ""new gritty realistic"" portrayal. Obviously the entire budget was spent on Keira Knightley's pay cheque, hence a ridiculous CGI shot of her on a cliff in Derbyshire (too expensive to actually go there was it?), and an obviously puffing smoke machine in the scene where Darcy comes striding through the ""mist"". The script is a horrific mix of lines lifted straight from the book alongside ones that sound jarringly modern. The plot, due to time restrictions, is literally told to us in huge speeches by the characters, bludgeoning the audience round the head with facts, rather than letting us find out for ourselves. Charlotte Lucas telling Lizzy why she has married Mr Colins is a case in point, as is Lydia telling Lizzy that Mr Darcy paid for her wedding, and the most ridiculous example is when Lizzy is telling her father that she does in fact love Darcy, because he's not proud or prejudiced at all, he's actually really nice and they've all been wrong the whole time. Thanks for that, we would never have known. And then Mr Bennet actually cries! The acting has highs and lows; Rosamund Pike and Brenda Blethyn shine, Keira Knightely reveals that in fact she is nothing but a pretty face and couldn't act her way out of a paper bag, and Donald Sutherland doesn't even attempt an English accent. As your reviewer in Belfast noted, the film is simply too short to do the book justice, and instead of being bold and attempting a brave new adaptation, Working Title have simply shoe horned information into a visually arresting but patently ridiculous new film, which neither justifies its existence by taking a new look at a classic or backs itself up with good performances from its cast. The emotion and humour of the novel have been beaten to a pulp by terrible acting and a shameful script. I laughed til I cried at the pure schmaltzy crassness of some of the scenes, and was literally embarrassed at some points for those members of the cast with any talent. I read in one review that none of the cast nor the director had ever read the book before embarking on this film. Believe me, it shows.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too Good For Words,"Absolutely amazing movie. Funny, happy and has an outstanding soundtrack. It makes you want to read the book so that you can constantly think about the movie and the AMAZING characters. Incredibly acting, actors and actresses were always in character and portrayed the characters very well, just like in the book. You cant get bored watching the movie, it doesn't slow down or get boring at anytime. Costumes, hair and make up, location and style was very very well done. The people picked for this movie were exactly what I would imagine they'd look like when I read the book. Few funny parts and you can always feel happy watching it no matter how many times you have seen it. I'd say it is one of the best movies I have seen that is set in the olden days. This is one of the GREATEST romance film and novel, beats Twilight or any other new romance movies/novels. Credit to all the people involved in this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A wonderfully happy movie,"Well, let me start off by saying that anyone who says this is a horrible re adaptation of Jane Austens novel is crazy. I have read the book and seen the BBC series and enjoyed them both. This movie though did something the novel and mini series didn't....it filled me with joy. Just thinking back to watching the movie for the first time makes me happy, and I think any movie that does that can't be all bad. Yes the script may not have kept every line just the same, and some phrases maybe wouldn't have been said in public. But in their house, the Bennets are just like any other family, they have drama and fights and there is jealousy, but they love each other. I enjoyed that aspect of the movie very much. Also, the casing was superb. Keira Knightly made a perfect Elizabeth Bennet and Mathew Macfayden was a wonderfully new fresh face for Mr. Darcy. Even though they left out some of the scenes I loved in the book and the BBC series, I truly believe anyone will enjoy this movie. Everyone should at least watch the movie, even if you haven't read the book. But I guarantee that after you watch the movie you will want to read it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Female interplay, dialog and cinematography exceptionally good","Mathew McFadyen, ex spook, kept reminding me that this might be an MI5 production.All the important elements were there. Acting was superb. Much thought has gone into the flawless script. The cinematography is dragged into the 21st century. Keira Knightly blooms as an English rose .. and 'Jane' is prettier ..The settings are beautiful and rustic. One can see the nearness that poverty has to Bennet lives. The five daughters and no governess almost explaining the thoughtless self absorption of the mother.For me, the only thing that jars is the feeling that a gang of Spooks may be on hand to drag Wickham away ..The cinematic aspects that are modernised are the fades and visual segways. On occasion a character might be introduced with the sun behind them .. maintaining ambiguity for a short time. Some of the fades make the scenes appear like old photo images .. and the countryside is achingly beautiful.Knightly's hair looks dirty. The strength of this version lies in inflating the female interplay beyond A&E's, yet maintaining balance. One can see that the long suffering father loves the mother, although he endures her pettiness. His quips are not threats. The mother's pettiness is softened by his love and the forgiveness of Elizabeth who accepts her mother and respects her despite the shortcomings.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
I think I loved it...,"I was a huge fan of the miniseries when that came out. Colin Firth was as someone else put it ""The definitive"" Darcy. However I fell in love with this Darcy pretty early on. He was more likable than the other Darcy from the start. The pace was a lot faster than the miniseries for obvious reasons. Some aspects of it I absolutely loved. I liked that the difference between the poor and rich was played up so much. I loved the new Mr Bingley Character. I loved the fathers character. Yes it was very different but it was good for most part of it. If you go to see it then expect that this is another interpretation of the film. Keira is good but can be a little irritating at times (her spiteful and happy expression is the same) but if I had never ever seen the ABC miniseries. I would now have the ultimate favourite movie. I intend to see it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Excellent till the last 3 minutes,"I agree with all that was said in the previous review, but had to add my own two cents. I must make it known that I adore the 1995 mini series, and unfortunately for Matthew M, Colin Firth with always be my Mr Darcy. That said, Matthew was fantastic and did a commendable job filling Colin's daunting shoes. My only qualm with the movie comes at the end. I won't spoil it for you, but I was hoping for a much more satisfying conclusion! While the parting line was clever, it left me feeling empty, like the entire two hours I'd invested watching the movie was for nothing! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE give us an alternate ending on the DVD!! We must at least see Lizzie and Darcy together, ANYTHING!!",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
An absolutely magnificent debut for Joe Wright for my Jane Austin's favorite novel!!!,"I fell in love at first sight with this film, I liked every thing about it, and that way my heart beats faster every time I see Keira Knightley; she proved that she is a really talented actress and that nomination in that very particular time gave her career a great boost.The cinematography is absolutely perfect and this is why I liked this film, it gives you that great feeling of the British country in 19th century, and how about a brief presence of Judi Dench, oh god this is just what I needed, it is about perfect.And better yet considering that this is a debut for Joe Wright I think he has just revealed himself as the filmmaker to be watched.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Outstanding performances,I have only watched two adaptations of Pride and Prejudice. This one and the 1995 mini series. When doing a book adaptation it's impossible to please everyone especially on a book so widely beloved this one pleased me.I've seen some reviews that nitpick this movie to death for historical inaccuracies. If you're looking for an adaptation faithfully accurate to the times this one might fall a bit short and the mini series might be closer to the mark.If you are looking for a movie that captures the essence of Elizabeth and Darcy this is the one.This shortened version leaves out some charming scenes and lines from the book. However when given the excellent portrayal of the characters (particularly Elizabeth and Darcy) I find that easy to forgive.If you loved Colin Firth's Darcy. This one might not be for you. Personally I like him as an actor but as Darcy he went from cold fish to love sick pup and right back to cold fish again. The final scene between Darcy and Elizabeth in the 1995 version is abut as warm as an ice cube on Darcy's part... not so here.I felt Matthew Macfadyen did a much better job of capturing the essence of Darcy and brought his inner struggle across rather than merely appearing devoid of emotion entirely. Keira Knightley was stunningly captivating as Elizabeth and the chemistry between the two cannot be surpassed.Really I can't find much fault in the portrayal of any character that was included from the book except Miss Darcy... it was a charming portrayal but not at all true to the book's description of the character. I feel Miss DeBerg looked a little too healthy and handsome also. Neither will trouble you if you haven't read the book or perhaps watched a different adaptation.,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
