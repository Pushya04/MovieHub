The Grim Reaper On Sabbatical,"The old Paramount classic Death Takes A Holiday gets a stylish turn of the 21st century remake, Meet Joe Black with Brad Pitt as the grim reaper himself taking a sabbatical to experience what he deprives everyone of, ultimately. The story has been updated from Italy during World War I to America in the new age of information.The guy who benefits for a short while is multimillionaire media tycoon Anthony Hopkins who is approaching his 65th birthday. He's a widower with two daughters, Marcia Gay Harden who is married to Jeffrey Tambor and Clare Forlani who's in love with love. In fact at the beginning of the film Clare who is a doctor has a chance meeting with Brad Pitt just before he's rundown in a busy New York street and the pale horseman takes over his body.It's a good thing Hopkins got this reprieve because there's some real nasty double-dealing taking place in his firm. His young right hand man, Jake Weber, is looking to affect a merger with another conglomerate that would ruin all that Hopkins has built in his life. But Weber of course hasn't the slightest idea who Hopkins's new ally is. Let alone the resources he can bring to bear.Meet Joe Black is a fine film which has a lot to say about the meaning of life and how important it is to use that time on earth in mortal form to become the best you can be. Pitt and Hopkins have very good chemistry and Webber is one of the slimier villains ever put on film.And see how it all works out for everyone in the end. In fact that's the real message of Meet Joe Black, it all does work out in the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Reflective And Philosophical,"For a long time I put off watching this, because I have no interest in superficial, teen comedy flicks, as implied by the film's pedestrian title and by the casting of a youthful Brad Pitt. But ""Meet Joe Black"" is anything but ""superficial"", and ""teen comedy"" does not describe this movie at all.Set in contemporary New York, the film follows a wealthy family whose patriarchal sixty-five year old head, played by Anthony Hopkins, is nearing the end of his life. Enter ""Joe Black"" (Brad Pitt), a handsome, but enigmatic, young man with an unusual agenda.This is a thought-provoking movie about mortality and emotional separation. It will appeal to viewers with a reflective and philosophical nature. But the film also has humor, which keeps it from being grim. The pace is slow. There's lots of silence and stillness, entirely appropriate, given the subject matter. Among other things, the film presents the novel idea that a supernatural being can be subject to human emotions, and can make mistakes in judgment resulting from those emotions.The film is not perfect. The plot is a tad egocentric. There's no reference to the universality and ongoing occurrence of death outside the confines of this family. Also, why now? Why does death choose to engage life in our present world, why not five hundred years ago? Minor script changes could have addressed these issues. The initial meeting between Susan (Claire Forlani) and Joe Black seems a little too convenient, but forms the basis for a plot twist that strengthens the overall story.The acting is excellent. Anthony Hopkins is, as usual, outstanding. I would not have cast Brad Pitt in the role he plays, but he does a good job. Appropriate for this movie, the acting style for both Pitt and Forlani is one wherein they communicate their characters to viewers largely by means of their eyes, which, as taught by ancient philosophers, are the windows of the soul.For viewers who liked ""The Sixth Sense"", another serious film with depth of meaning, I recommend ""Meet Joe Black"" most highly.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Carries Itself Well,"Death, who takes the form of a young man (Brad Pitt), asks a media mogul (Anthony Hopkins) to act as a guide to teach him about life on Earth and in the process he falls in love with his guide's daughter (Claire Forlani).So this is a remake of a movie that was adapted from a play. Typically that could be concerning, as a remake is not often as good as the original. In this case, though, it may even be better... the cast is solid (with Forlani in one of her rare decent roles), and Brad Pitt making a name for himself (as if he has not already).Really, this is a great display of Pitt's acting. He has solid range here, possibly more than anything else he has done. The character is very complex, and there is the odd twist that Forlani is attracted to him because he looks like someone he is not, and not for any deeper reason. Amazingly, even at three hours, this film never drags.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Truly Enchanting Movie!,"Meet Joe Black is a beautiful film with a talented cast.  Because it is unique, the plot enables humor to be weaved within the dramatic and romantic elements.  The music, composed by Thomas Newman (Shawshank Redemption, Erin Brokovich) truly enhances the movie.  The many string and piano melodies are beautiful, and fit smoothly. There are so many memorable moments, like father-daughter conversations, and the scene in the coffee shop. Brad Pitt, in his portrayal of Death,displays naive and vulnerable feelings, skillfully in sharp contrast his behavior at the beginning of the film.  While some criticize its length and unrealistic aspects of the plot, I found it to be so captivating and quite well-made.  Meet Joe Black has an indescribable effect on me whenever I watch it. The story of Death being apprentice to a respected, accomplished man makes one realize the simple beauties of life-- passion, family, love... and peanut butter.",,Anonymous,Romance
22 years later. And it still knocks you out.,"Film reviews are irrelevant. Perception is key. Meet Joe Black is a meet on its own. If you are not into romantic tear jerkers, watch this film and find out that your human and have the ability to change your mind. I speak from experience. The story: Simple and easy to understand. The director made a simple life event into a magical experience. Love and death go hand in hand in a mixture of sublime acting, awesome sceneries, superb dialogues, nerve touching details and result in a romantic drama where the happy ending does not cover the sadness and emotions and leaves you choked till the last over the rainbow tune ends. After 40 years of watching thousands of films, this film still is my number 1 film in my top 100 films where all one hundred share the first place. Brad Pitt, Sir Anthony Hopkins (brilliant classical composer btw) and the gorgeous Claire Forlany showed of their qualities. Same for all the other participants in thisepic story about how life will go on. Perception. ... but from my pov their best acting ever. I have seen it at least once every 2 years. If it will be your first time, settle for it. If you are still young, and think you become a film addict, be aware! You will get drawn in this film for decades to come. Enjoy this experience. And let it knock you out as well ☺",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Surprisingly FANTASTIC!,"I didn't think I'd like this movie, but once i watched it I was hooked! Brad Pitt really made it feel like he was death - not acting as death. And this film also for the time being made me not afraid of dying. I love the acting, the storyline, everything!My rating 10/10 just excellent!",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Minimalist Masterpiece,"Somewhere in the netherworld between being a ""remake"" and merely ""inspired by"" Mitchell Leisen's 1934 film Death Takes a Holiday, Meet Joe Black is the story of Death personified. Death takes over the body of Brad Pitt's unnamed character, later donned ""Joe Black"" by William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins). Although the motivation isn't specified but implied in this film, Death wishes to experience the life he normally takes away--he wants to see what it's like to be human. He chooses Parrish to be his guide because Parrish is a hugely successful media mogul who has conviction, strong ""moral fiber"" and insight on life. Compounding the situation, Parrish's daughter, Susan (Claire Forlani), is a woman whom Brad Pitt's unnamed character met in a coffee shop that morning and had an instant mutual attraction with. Black sticks close by William's side through much of the film, creating difficult situations at a time when Parrish's company is trying to deal with a financially attractive but ethically unsavory takeover bid, and he also puts the boil to somewhat strained familial relationships.First, a word of warning. This is a very long film (3 hours), and it tends to be very slowly paced. If you are averse to either, or if you do not like any of the three principalsPitt, Hopkins and Forlani--I'd advise you to avoid the film.For me, I never think that a film's length is a problem in itself. As long as the film works, I'd be happy with it lasting 4, 5, even 12 hours or more--heck, I even gladly sat through Gettysburg (1993) in the theater. There have been films I've thought were too long (such as Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, 1962), but it's contextual, not related to actual running time.Helmer Martin Brest directs with a lot of deliberation. Lines of dialogue and responses are stretched out to ""infinity and taken to the depth of forever"". The camera gives us lots of lingering gazes. There is little to no ""action"" in the film. Much of it is similar to David Lynch's famed pregnant pauses. Some people hate that style. I love it (although I love other styles, too--I like variety), and for me, the pacing makes this film seem much shorter than its actual running time. It's the complete opposite of the pacing of, say, Medallion (2003), which is interesting given that both films feature Forlani. It's also interesting to note that Brest's career seems to match the pacing of Meet Joe Black. He's taken 2, 4, 5 and 6 years between films. Obviously, Brest is not in a rush.If you watch Meet Joe Black immediately after watching Death Takes a Holiday, as I did this time around, a few things might strike you as odd and slightly negative at first. The principal difference that had this initial effect on me was the change in the primary romantic relationship--between Joe and Susan (and between Prince Sirki (Frederic March) and Grazia (Evelyn Venable) in the original). In the original, it's ambiguous whether Grazia doesn't recognize Sirki for what he really is all along. She at least never meets him as Sirki rather than Death-as-Sirki. It creates interesting philosophical scenarios about humankind's conception and fear of death; Grazia, who is a bit aloof all along, may be embracing death rather than fearing it, not as something negative, but more metaphysically, as inherent in the idea of life.In Meet Joe Black, Susan falls for Pitt as another character first. It removes all of the philosophical points about one's attitude towards death (with the exception of William, who is the only one who knows the truth, even in the end, and who implicitly goes through vacillating feelings about death). However, despite my initial hesitation on the change, I tried to remember my commitment to judge each film on its own terms rather than its relation to other works, and I realized that the relationship set up here is interesting for another reason--it explores public identity in relationships and the tensions that arise through dynamicism of that public identity. That's a theme throughout the film, not just in its romantic relationships.Pitt has often been criticized for his performance here, but in my opinion, it's perfect for the character(s)--just as good in its own way as March's turn as Sirki in the original. Once Pitt as Death takes over ""Joe Black's"" body, he _must_ change his persona in the way he does. He's supposed to be a supernatural being who normally relates to the world in a completely different way, but now he's suddenly made corporeal. He doesn't know what to do as a human. As an entity, he's not daft, lacking power or unknowledgeable about many things, but he's incredibly naïve and awkward as a thing of flesh. He's not used to relating to the world in that way. He's not used to making facial expressions. He's never tasted food, and so on. The change he undergoes in the beginning and end of the film is amazing and shows just how skilled Pitt is.Hopkins and Forlani are of course no slouches, either. Hopkins' ability to go from understated and elegant to manic is put to good use; the role seems tailor-made for him. Forlani, who has a very unusual but intriguingly beautiful face that always looks a bit pouty, gets to pout even more, creating a bizarrely complex but effective character. The rest of the primary cast is just as good. The end result is a strangely dysfunctional family with a lot of depth.While I can see people preferring Death Takes a Holiday to this film, for me, Meet Joe Black is slightly better. It's much more epic, of course, and that scope, plus the incredible score by Thomas Newman, pushes its emotional effectiveness up a notch. But make sure you do not miss either film. Both are excellent and unusual.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Celebrates living,"A great film that is very ordinary and what I mean by that is, it celebrates normality unlike most movies these days. I felt it was slow-paced, given that we expect movies to show and make us feel things we will never have and make us forget our own reality and the truth of how limited time we have, which this flick is good 3-hour reminder of. Enjoy the small things like peanut butter ;) and live everyday like it's your last.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"In short, an excellent and not too long film","Whenever this film is aired, I'm drawn to watch it. The pace, like life, is slow. Some people find this to be a problem. I feel sorry for those people; maybe they've been so saturated by ""fast food"" films and reality TV that they think that's the way life is supposed to be. Unlike life, the film has no ""wasted space"". So, while it may seem too long for theatre viewing, it's plenty short for sitting back in an easy chair for three hours and just letting it draw you in--with the excellent dialogue (including the Patois), excellent performances by truly talented actors, and above all the [again] excellent score by Mr. Newman. If you're a romantic not just about love, but also about life, then treat yourself and watch it.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Engrossing story and one majestic performance, both compromised by puppy love subplot","Anthony Hopkins is resplendent and regal as a 65-year old communications tycoon who wakes one morning with pains and is hearing voices; turns out his time has come to check out, but the personification of Death (""a kid in a suit"", Hopkins says) has decided to take a vacation and allow Hopkins a chance to say goodbye. The 1934 movie ""Death Takes a Holiday"", which was based on a hit play from the 1920's, was certainly ripe for a re-imagining, and that job has been accomplished here very well. Brad Pitt's Grim Reaper is a bit like Peter Sellers in ""Being There"", a wide-eyed innocent and fish-out-of-water; to his credit however, Pitt doesn't rely on coy shtick and has a few excellent moments (particularly with an ill Jamaican woman in the hospital). A romantic subplot between Pitt and Hopkins' youngest daughter is handled with exasperating taste, prolonging the proceedings to an inordinate length (and capping the movie with a ridiculous final ten minutes), but Anthony's glorious performance remains the centerpiece of the film and it's worth watching just to see the master at work. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The stuff that legends are made from,"This film caught me off-guard. I wasn't prepared for the impact it had on me. A wonderful sensation permeates this story in which Death takes a body to wear (I would like to choose too...) to discover what its like to be a human being. Hopkins and Pitt act like they've never done anything else - they are brilliant. If you doubt my words, watch the first 15 minutes and tell me: don't you get goose bumps when Hopkins hears Death whisper in his ear? I sure did. I hail this film as one of the best - ever.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pitt & Hopkins Make This Confusing Movie Enjoyable,"Meet Joe Black is confusing. If you are the kind of person who enjoys a movie where you have to try to determine what you believe the meaning of the story is, then you will like this film. If you would rather watch a movie that has a straightforward story, then avoid this completely.I am personally not a huge fan of films like this. Generally, I see them as a gimmick to lovers of old literature who enjoy acting like a sleuth in figuring out what the story means. I used to enjoy doing that in my literature classes in college, but don't enjoy that with films.Brad Pitt plays Death, who comes to visit Anthony Hopkins for a week or so before Hopkins is to die. Somewhere along the way, Hopkins is supposed to have a revelation about what life means, and I suppose the audience is supposed to as well. It is all rather confusing as to what we are supposed to learn. This film is definitely trying to convey a message, but you have to decipher what it is and quite frankly, it is not that awe inspiring of a message.With this said, Pitt really is incredible in this film. It is one of his best all-time performances and he has great chemistry on screen with Hopkins. Hopkins, as usual, is also excellent. If it wasn't for the great acting and chemistry of these to performers, I would have stopped watching the movie. As it turned out, I enjoyed watching the film in its entirety just to see these two work. Rating 7 of 10 stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Meet Joe Black For Three Long Hours,"With rare ex exceptions, no movie should be over 2 hours long. This one is three and should have been cut way down. Bad editing.

"a little long, but well done.","It's LONG.  180 minutes long.  Personally, I think the way Martin Brest stretched out the scenes was additive to the movie rather than destructive. Brad Pitt plays the character of death (as written) marvelously, and Claire Forlani is above acceptable as Susan, but not exactly Oscar material either. Hopkins and Jake Weber (Drew) run away with the plot, Weber ranks next to Billy Zane (Cal from _Titanic_) as Hollywood's next great bad guy. Incredibly solid technically, the camera work and sets are incredibly well done, and it's very nice to see a beautiful movie that wasn't created on a Macintosh or Silicon Graphics computer in some studio, but in front of a real camera.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Hard to let go isn't it? What can I tell you...that's life.,"The bottom line, having seen this film over a dozen times and watching it again, experiencing it for the first time. This film is so utterly moving. It has near perfect cinematography and even better lighting. Every shot has so much depth and they took such care in the composition.The score is absolutely flawless. It informs the characters emotions and causes an inner reflection in the viewer that rivals several John Barry scores.Claire Forlani is absolutely perfect in this role. Her eyes grab you and allow you to see such vulnerability that few performances have matched. Some of the best scenes involve supporting roles. Marcia Gay Harden is a pro and some of the most touching moments she grabs a hold of. It all comes from a very real place, and is exciting to watch.I've read some pretty brutal reviews. I just don't think they come from a place where the person wants to sit down and watch a 3 hour love story with fantasy elements. Moreover, the reviews are so tome deaf, and reek of jealousy. You have to let yourself into these characters lives to fully appreciate it.If Euphoria is your taste this is definitely not for you,This is a story about a man who loved his wife, adores his daughters and has had a very successful existence. It's about being able to hold on, and have the courage and gratitude to let go.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"This is the film that never ends, it goes on and on my friend.","I'm reminded of the Lars Von Trier quote about Willem Dafoe being ""confusingly large."" I feel the same way about the runtime for Meet Joe Black, because it doesn't find enough things to do about three hours.Apparently, there's a 2-hour-cut of this that the director hates, but that does seem like it would be a more reasonable runtime for the story at hand. As it stands, Meet Joe Black has still got some charm, some humour, and some sort of effective romance, but it's all just stretched too thin. I think there are clear subplots that could've been cut down or even excised entirely found throughout this. Just keep the focus of every scene on Pitt, his love interest, or Anthony Hopkins (preferably more than one of them at once, prioritising those character interactions above all else) and you're all good. Superfluous stuff can get right out of there. Marcia Gay Harden, the woman at the hospital, most of the boardroom bickering... just stuff that needed trimming.It's more realistically like a 6 or 7/10 movie as far as its technical qualities go, but gotta shave off a point or two for how slow and overlong it is. Did they release it like this because Titanic had recently come out and proven to be a successful romantic drama with an epic runtime?

Purely Captivating!,"I first saw this film many years after its first release and let me tell you I have never since or will I ever see such a moving and purely captivating movie.Anthony Hopkins is already my idol and I have admired him for many years. There's something about the unique persona he brings upon any character he plays in a movie, as if he leaves part of himself behind on the film reel each time. From psychological thrillers like The Silence of the Lambs to emotional dramas, he also strikes me as a modest man and is, in my eyes a true genius!Meet Joe Black is a strange tale that challenges our preconceptions of death. You come out of the film not so much enlightened but convinced that Bill Parrish is happy with the fate that comes upon him and that everyone else is too. It's immensely sad yet happy at the same time and thought-provoking. It is also a very long movie, which I believe strengthens it as you feel you have a bond with the main characters having known them for a long time and thus share the highs and the lows emotionally throughout the plot.Providing you can stick to the 3hour film length it will truly be one of the most memorable films you'll ever watch.

"A philosophical, wonderful, romantic picture, but...","The film will certainly not leave you indifferent, but you may find it very long and drawn out. The golden years of beauty of Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani, with an equally gorgeous Anthony Hopkins, are the main cherries of this film.The picture has a philosophy, and can't help but touch you about the meaning of being. The melodrama with its romance with beautiful actors will keep you captivated. The plot will hold your gaze until the very end, and the music will hold and nudge your emotions from watching. The entire movie is well done, but...The plot has holes, some scenes will seem drawn out, some moments are silly that you wanted to rewind away or even turn the movie off! This may sound harsher than it actually is, but still. This movie didn't need to be stretched that far, it could definitely have been made shorter.Despite the low rating and flaws, this movie can really be okay to watch.

The minor expressions of the characters are the ones that count the most sometimes even if it takes a bit more time for each scene.I love how Brad Pitt can embody the character that well. He had the poker face/cold expression the whole time. The way he talked was also interesting. When he was Joe his tone was different than from the guy at the coffee shop.I also loved the change of the accent when he was at the hospital. Hopkins was a 10/10 as always. I think the roles he picks have part of his dynamic personality. Claire is one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen.

"One of the best films of 1998, I can't praise this film enough!","I must admit to have been slightly hesistant when I first heard about Meet Joe Black because of the subject matter and its length, however I found this film to be superb.The acting was believable, the cinematography of the film was well thought out and extremely picturesque. The soundtrack by Thomas Newman (the Shawshank Redemption) went from chilling to the most beautiful melodies that I have ever heard (giving, in my humble opinion, any classical composer a run for their money), adding an extra depth to this film.There are no in-betweens in this film: you WILL either love or hate this film. However, I can say that this film is one of the most uplifting and life affirming movies that I have ever seen. It left me both moved and confident that the world was not such a bad place after all.

"Long on visuals, short on action.","If your main reason going to the movies is to see Brad Pitt going through every imaginable facial expression (and a bit of his pectorals) then you'll probably enjoy most of these three hours.  Claire Forlani has a wondrously enigmatic face, but it was too enigmatic for too long.  One expects more from a film that comes from the same stable as ""Scent of a Woman.""  The four writers surely could have done more with the ingredients they were given.  A promising young doctor and Death?  They just let the opportunity slide. Anthony Hopkins did his usual performance, but possibly the best act was Jeffrey Tambor, playing the apple-short-of-an-orchard manipulatable guy married into a New York boardroom.

I mean, so badly paced I was bored after 20 minutes, then noticed it's Three Hours Long.Once I was about 45 minutes in and started getting the gist of the characters, I could figure out a better way to write about half the lines. The ""death and taxes"" callback in a movie that respected our intelligence should have been ""only two things in life are inevitable, Drew.""Oh, except for Death. He was... conveniently written. Unaware AND all knowing. Sometimes in the same sentence. Things this contrived do not work to make me get absorbed into a film.Well acted by pretty much everyone (Brad Pitt was... not well characterized so I didn't like him one bit in either role, but that's probably not his fault).

Great movie,"I have been hesitant to watch Meet Joe Black because of how the story sounds. Death takes the form of a young man and takes a vacation with a millionaire and falls in love with his (the millionaire's) daughter. Death then faces a moral issue of whether to stay with his love, or go back from whence he came. Sounds a bit corny, no?Then after I watched the movie, I immediately thought it was a masterpiece. Believable acting, conveying much emotion, interesting and unpredictable story, and very developed characters. There are interesting twists and characters significantly develop through the movie. Even though you don't like the movie, you would be intrigued by the difference between Joe Black at the beginning of the movie and Joe Black at the end.I have not included much of the plot in this comment. You should watch the movie yourself. I assure you, it is more than just a love story.Definitely a must-see.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely Spectacular Movie that leaves you Pondering for Days Afterward,"I thought this movie was quite clearly spectacular. I mean, from the trailer it looked like some teen, low-production-cost flick that I'd stay as far away as possible, but in truth, the movie was deep, meaningful and left you thinking about it for ages and ages afterward.The actors were brilliant. I thought Brad Pitt, against a lot of people's expectations, performed very convincingly, and Anthony Hopkins, as always, stunned me and transported me. Claire Forlani was the only main actress who suffered slightly but still pulled off a reasonable performance. I personally thought the Jamaican Woman, played by Lois Kelly-Miller was very touching, and the conversations between most of the characters were all interesting and well, some of the advice you could put into use in your own daily lives.The story line is edgy and dwells on sensitive subjects such as Death, Love and Happiness, I suppose. The wisdom behind it is unmistakable. I think this movie is underrated. Despite the disappointing Trailer, the movie will blow you away. I watched it on VCD, something that has low-ish quality on a computer, yet I managed to sit through all 170 minutes, completely stunned and unable to budge from concentration.Overall, this movie is definitely recommended. A bit deep for your kids, I guess- I tried watching it with my niece but she ruined it slightly by everlasting flow of questions.I'm giving it a 10/10 for it being emotional and funny at times.

Spectacular Story Telling,"This is in my opinion as close to a perfect movie as one can get. Character development is off the charts, the top three actors (Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt, Claire Forlani), are perfect. The innocence, the messaging, the dialogue, the movie is perfect. This is storytelling that makes one go to movies. These performances are exceptional, this acting is incredible, this story is compelling from start to finish. The interaction with the island lady is incredible. The dialogue is brilliant, this is special. Watch it. Think on it. This is so deep. This is movie making. This is so thought provoking.

When death comes to dinner,"An aging businessman chances death and has to define his legacy. Don't be tricked Anthony Hopkins is the protagonist like a Christmas carol has look death in the face. While his daughter confronts the death of love. Pretty good writing throughout and jokes thrown in intelligently and strangely. The problem with this movie is that it's long drawn out, during the long dialogues my brain switches off and thinks about something else, this movie is over 2 and half hours. Also the sound mixing needs tweaking in a lot of the scenes the characters are mumbling meaning you have to really concentrate to understand them over the rather really good soundtrack.

You have to see parts , you have to be non-interested, ""oh this is just another bad brad Pitt movie"", but you watch parts over and over , because Anthony Hopkins is one of the greatest actors of all time. I can't believe watching this movie on Valentine's day how empathetic Anthony Hopkins is , how terrible he is as Hannibal Lechter. This is a great movie, you must come to love. You must watch it and think nothing of it. Then watch it again some time later, you will begin to understand it. You will begin to understand how wonderful this movie, How true it is. How absolutely real and caring the movie is. It combines life, death, love, and greed for all things. To love someone and what love is , truly is defined in the movie.

Death as Brad Pitt,"Who can fear death when it looks like Brad Pitt?World's longest movie and a remake of Death Takes a Holiday.Nothing can beat the TV movie remake with Melvyn Douglas, Myrna Loy, Monte Markham, and Yvette Mimieux. It had a better script and for me, more poignancy.However it's hard to go wrong with Anthony Hopkins and a gorgeous Brad Pitt. The film had good comedy and beautiful music. The cast is excellent, including Marcia Gay Harden, Jeffrey Tambor, June Squibb, and Claire Forlani.Also I found the ending satisfying and poignant.There have been several riffs on this story. The Frederic March version was more stylized and melodramatic, given that it was made 80-some years ago. The aforementioned TV movie was wonderful.This version took a different route, but I liked it.

Meet Joe Black,"In the recent thriller The Edge, Anthony Hopkins played a wealthy businessman who is transformed by a harrowing encounter with death. In Meet Joe Black, Anthony Hopkins plays Bill, a similar character confronting similar themes, but with a very different twist. Here he meets Death as played by Brad Pitt. Death informs Bill that he wants to see what life is like and he wants Bill to teach him. So long as Death is interested and learning, Bill gets more time. When Bill has to introduce Death to his family at dinner, he fumbles around for a name, eventually coming up with Joe Black.This is hardly the first film to depict bargains with Death. In Ingmar Bergman's Seventh Seal the allegorical figure of death (complete with shroud) is challenged to a game of chess. His intended victim hopes to forestall the inevitable. Bergman's Death character is reprised in Woody Allen's Love and Death, The Last Action Hero, and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. In Meet Joe Black we are spared the shroud since Death decided to borrow a body from one of his victims. (If you gotta' have one, might as well borrow one that looks like Brad Pitt, I guess.)The real twist in this film comes in what could be taken as the sub-plot. Death falls in love with Bill's daughter Susan. Susan is involved with Drew, her father's right-hand man in the business world. Drew meanwhile is conniving at some underhanded business deals of his own. The plot takes more than a few twists and turns along the way, but in the end it is neither the plot nor the grand theme (if there is one) that makes the film engaging. Sometimes its the ride itself that makes the journey worthwhile.Frankly, there are more than a few problems of plausibility here (even after we grant willing suspension of disbelief to the central premise). As one small example, Joe Black is fluent in Jamaican patois, but doesn't know how to tie a tie. The cinematography is good, but not outstanding, and the performances are no more that what we would expect under the circumstances.Still in all, there were more than a few moments along the way where the audience laughed pretty hard. At one point the audience applauded (in the middle of the movie no less), and I'm sure there were more than a few smiles on more than a few occasions. By the end of the film, director Martin Brest (Scent of a Woman) has given us quite a few simple pleasures along the way. If there is a grand theme to the film, perhaps that is it . . . . it's the simple pleasures that make life good, and in the end, caring is everything.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Pretty Vacant (but it Sticks to the Roof of Your Mouth),"""Death Takes a Holiday"" is revised and updated for a lovingly glamorized Brad Pitt. According to the DVD sleeve's synopsis, ""Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) has it all - success, wealth, and power. Days before his 65th birthday he receives a visit from a mysterious stranger, Joe Black (Pitt), who soon reveals himself as Death. In exchange for extra time, Bill agrees to serve as Joe's earthly guide. But, will he regret his choice when Joe unexpectedly falls in love with Bill's beautiful daughter Susan (Claire Forlani)?""The picturesque Pitt (and Mr. Hopkins) will please most aficionados; but, the movie is overindulgent. Jake Weber (as Drew), Marcia Gay Harden (as Allison), and Jeffrey Tambor (as Quince) give the production fireworks some much-needed balance, with fine second tier performances; possibly, Mr. Weber offers the film's best characterization. The scenes with Pitt confabbing with a Jamaican woman in the hospital should have been sent to deleted scenes heaven; the actress, Lois Kelly-Miller, could have played a doctor who recognized Pitt as an accident victim.****** Meet Joe Black (11/2/98) Martin Brest ~ Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Your Thanksgiving Turkey Has Arrived!,"I was not at all surprised to see four writers on the credits for this film, as it is such an inconstant mish-mash of one ill-defined character after another. There was no way only one thinking person wrote this film. The film moves ponderously from one glacially paced scene after another. I saw this movie at 8:00 in the evening and by 9:00 my son had to shake me because I was snoring in the theater. I don't recall ever falling asleep during a movie before, but ""Meet Joe Black"" did it to me. It is hard to say how long I was ""out"" for. The same scene I was watching when I lost consciousness was still on when I was awakened. In this film that could mean I was out for a second or two or for 10 minutes. The scenes just go on and on and on with not much of anything being said.My wife was crying through the whole picture and was deeply moved by the whole affair. When I asked her why she said the truths of the movie touched her. To save you from three hours of trite tediousness I present those truths to you now: 1). Families should love one another, 2) don't marry unless you are in love, and 3) good people don't have to fear death. I would add to this list: 1) You can fall in love with someone if he looks like Brad Pitt even though his personality changes repeatedly and you have no idea who he is, 2) death does not know what peanut butter is, but can slip in and out of a Jamaican riff at the drop of a hat, and 3) overly contrived plotting is not the dead art we all hoped it would be by now.Now before I start hearing the obvious `This guy just hates Brad Pitt' remarks, you should know that I am the Brad Pitt fan in my house. I think Brad is a wonderful actor, but he is so wasted in this drivel. Likewise, Anthony Hopkins has nowhere to go with this script. Is he the hard-driven businessman with a lust for life so great that he attracts the attention of death itself, or is he the guy wasting away his few remaining hours on this planet playing solitaire? Is he the shrewd businessman who is in constant control of every situation, fast thinking and powerful, or is he a guy who stands there with a dumb, dull look on his face when questioned about the mysterious Joe Black, letting his company slip through his fingers? One minute he is calm and collected in his dealings with death, the next he explodes, saying he's fed up, the next he's calm again, and back and forth. Hopkins is a wonderful actor; unfortunately this script asked him to play three or four different roles as the same character.My son is a good boy and a wonderful son. however, if he were a great son he would have let me sleep through the rest of this film. I can tell it's getting close to Thanksgiving, the turkey just arrived.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Could have been charming and light  instead it's mostly tiresome, overlong and occasionally terrible","Media magnate William Parrish is approaching his 65th birthday.  While dealing with his business problems he advises his youngest daughter Susan that she must find true love.  She meets a young man in a coffee shop and falls for his charms but leaves without him.  When the young man is hit by a bus and killed, Death decides to use his body to visit earth.  He postpones the death of Parrish in return for experiencing life.  However his influence causes an impact on Parrish's business and on his daughter.This is a rework of 1934's `Death Takes a Holiday' - four writers worked tirelessly to take that short charmer and spin it into a ponderous three hour slog.  The story is simple enough - Death comes to earth, falls in love, makes friends, is a fish out of water but must eventually go back' - however it's seriously stretched and delivered in very slow chunks.  The various strands (the business confrontation, the romance etc) don't sit well together and it's like the writers all took turns rather than working together.  At the start it is quite charming, but the longer it goes on, the less you care and the less charming it becomes.Why did it have to be so long?  There are so many elements of the story that could have been trimmed down.  So many scenes could have been told in a shorter time or removed totally.  It feels like nothing they shot ended up on the cutting room floor.  For example, Pitt shares several scenes (total about 10 minutes) with an elderly Jamaican woman, these scenes don't add anything to the film: more than that they are terrible - Pitt does a horrible, horrible patwa accent.  Surely the editor should have removed these on quality alone!If this had been good then it wouldn't matter if it was so long - but there's only enough to last for 2 hours at most.  That's 60 minutes worth of filler that could have been lost.  The performances are mixed, but are mainly as heavy and unwieldy as the film itself.  Pitt starts well - his human' role is really charming and I thought that he was already Death and thought he'd be that way for the whole film.  However when he becomes death he is totally flat and lifeless - obviously that's how Death would be, but it makes him really dull and wastes the charm that has made him a star.  His Jamaican accent is absolutely terrible and just shows he has no judgement. Forlani holds her own well beside an experienced cast but the romance between her and death is unbelievable due to Pitt's stony performance. Hopkins is good throughout and shows Pitt up to be a star rather than an actor.  The support is mostly good - but that old Jamaican lady has got to go!The film is far too long - at one point I thought it was winding up and that the end must be 10 minutes away - it was winding up (and did what I thought it would) but instead of 10 minutes it took 45!  Such luxurious running times should only be permitted to films that can sustain them.Overall this could have been a charming little film.  Instead it buries that charm in a three hour running time that it can't sustain.  I liked it but I wished it would end after the first 120 minutes.  Somewhere out there - it is still going!",,Anonymous,Romance
Enjoyed it so much,"Meet Joe Black (1998) is a thoughtful and visually engaging film that earns a 7/10 for its intriguing yet somewhat uneven storytelling. Brad Pitt delivers a charismatic performance as Death, bringing a unique charm to his role, while Anthony Hopkins provides a solid portrayal of a wealthy media mogul. The cinematography is elegant, capturing the opulence and emotional depth of the story. The plot is both imaginative and contemplative, though it occasionally drags and can be overly sentimental. The soundtrack enhances the film's mood, with a score that complements its romantic and dramatic elements. Overall, it's a well-crafted film with strong performances, but it could benefit from a tighter narrative.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

Nothing I can write will do justice to how great this movie is!!!,"It's really rare that a movie makes an impact that this one has made. A true masterpiece.

But now after I've watched this twice, whenever someone ask me what to watch, this is the first one I recommend.2 hrs. 58 mins. Of pure drama with a touch of great background score. Clair Forlani, you beauty. The way she looks in this movie, I'm not a bit surprised that the death himself falls for her.Anthony Hopkins & Brad Pitt, best of their generation's, facing each other will just make you want that this must go on & on.One scene that will always remain in my heart is where Forlani comes out of the pool and Brad Pitt is having just peanut-butter out of a spoon.

Don't meet him,"This could have been a really good film if there had been some consistency with the character of Death. He is powerful and all-knowing when need be, and totally clueless the rest of the time. Death's work is to end every human life at their appointed time, but he has no idea what he's ending. So, for reasons unknown he has the time and ability to find out. Pitt is handsome and charming as a doomed young man in a coffee shop, and handsome, boring and charmless as Death. Hopkins can do great work even in a flawed film. Forlani is believable and beautiful, despite looking as though she is about to fall asleep every five to ten minutes. Not a good quality for a character in a nearly three hour movie. Harden and Tambor (both wonderful talents long before Larry Sanders existed) do some top-quality film work. The message seems to be that family is most important, lots and lots of money is really good, and that death and taxes are still inevitable. I think they also ask the cinematic question, ""Just how long can we get away with keeping the camera focused on a well-groomed Brad Pitt in total silence?""",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Marcia Gay Harden was extraordinary!,"This is a rather odd film and interesting.  I particularly enjoyed the supporting characters who were all excellent.  I've always been a fan of Jeffrey Tambor's and found his Quince character to be decent and touching. Jake Weber as Drew was terrific.  However, I was blown away by Marcia Gay Harden (playing Allison) and became a big admirer of hers.  I'm so glad she's become recognized and acknowledged!  What a gifted actress she is. Allison is so real and textured.  Marcia makes every scene count. (Mystic River is another example of her great talent.)

One of the Most Enjoyable Movies I've Seen,"This is one of those movies where you can unironically say ""they don't make them like they used to"" and ""you could not make this movie today"". Because it's a 3-hour-long movie with long scenes of dialogue for the whole runtime, and that's what's so great about it. The director isn't worried about time constraints and we have long scenes that linger and actually add to the enjoyment of the scene rather than making them boring. Not one scene made me think that it doesn't belong in the movie and I would've rather if it was cut, I enjoyed the 3 hours through and through. So some people might find it extremely boring and long, and I totally understand that, but not me, I didn't find it boring or long at all.This is also one of those movies where I don't care about the plot holes and love the movie regardless. And trust me, you can nitpick the ish out of this movie, but I don't care and enjoyed this movie thoroughly. The great acting and dialogue and the mesmerizing music must've hypnotized me because this movie is total bonkers and not realistic at all, but I loved every second of it. Not to mention one of the genre tags of the movie is fantasy, so I don't know why people expect total realism from it.Also also, this is one of those movies where I can see the problems and still enjoy it nonetheless. So I agree and totally understand if most people don't like this and at least 90% of their complaints are valid and I get why some won't like this ridiculous premise and plot or don't like character decisions, especially the younger daughter's. So I respect if someone didn't like it for valid reasons and not hating just for the sake of hating it, but like I said, I can see and agree with the problems and still enjoy the movie.Another reason that I liked this movie so much and that I enjoy this type of romantic movies is that there is fantasy and fiction integrated into the romance and it's not a generic romantic movie. I'm not really a romantic movie type of guy, but these seem to work for me. Another romantic movie that I loved was About Time and for the same reason, it uses the fantasy element to elevate the story and make it more interesting, and I take About Time and Meet Joe Black over other cookie-cutter ""realistic"" romantic movies that are just straight romance. Atonement is another great example of a great romantic movie for my taste, though it's not a fantasy like About Time or this movie, but it's another example of a unique and different romantic movie.Also don't get me wrong, the movies are still grounded in reality and that's what I mean when I say that the fantasy and supernatural elements serve the story, not the other way around.The acting by everyone in this movie is great and Anthony Hopkins once again shines and I get reminded of how great of an actor he is. It is actually shocking that he didn't even get nominated for this movie. Brad Pitt is amazing as always and Claire Forlani is great too. I don't think the movie and the romance would've worked if these two people weren't this attractive and beautiful and didn't have such great chemistry together for us to watch and never get bored of.Speaking of shocking Oscar snubs, the fact that they didn't even consider Thomas Newman for the masterpiece he created for this movie is just sad. The music is just one of the best things I've heard in movies and immediately became of my favorite movie themes. I quickly looked up and downloaded Whisper Of A Thrill after watching the movie. The movie wouldn't've been half as good without this amazing soundtrack.Like I said, the movie has tons of plot holes and problems and unrealistic stuff if you think about it, but the direction, the cinematography, the actors, the music, they all just did something that I can't really explain what, but they all came together to make a movie that I don't care about the nitpicks and the plot holes and just enjoy the ish out of it and I can look past the problems and still give it an 8/10 because I think it's that good and even more.Even if you're not into romantic movies or long 3-hour movies bore you, I recommend watching it because in my opinion, it is definitely worth watching at least one time in your lifetime. Don't deny yourself a movie with amazing scenes, amazing acting from Hopkins, mesmerizing music, and the beauty and chemistry of Pitt and Forlani.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A good movie, but did it have to be 3 hours long?","I've seen this movie a couple of times on television, but only bits of pieces of it. Now after finally getting a chance to see it all the way through, and at my own pace, I have to say this is a good movie. I liked all the actors performances, each of them add diligence to their characters. Even though Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt were the leads, I felt Jeffrey Tambor and Claire Forlani did the best jobs as the comical Quince and attractive Susan.The story maybe a little unrealistic (since it is about the Angel of Death wanting to be a human), but it has some moral lessons, such as enjoying life to the fullest, because it is too short. Thomas Newman's score sustains much of the mood and somewhat mystical feeling to the film. But the problem with this film is the length. Three hours. Sure, there's a plot going on, but does it really need 3 hours to develop? A bit too long for my taste. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Simply beautiful........,"Have you ever watched a movie where you are taken from one beautiful moment to another, and continues until the very end? well 'Meet Joe Black' is one such film.There are many other excellent reviews of this movie, and while I subscribe to most of those opinions, I like most how 'Meet Joe Black' puts the viewer in a rather unique perspective: To be able to 'feel' the characters innermost feelings through subtleties of their speech. How do you honestly answer a question you aren't supposed to, yet answer the question honestly? This movie is full of nuances of such dialogue exchanges which contain a superficial, yet profound undertone throughout.I also like the presence Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani bring to the screen, and the complementary performances that resemble a finely-tuned symphony. The storyline, dialogue and character development is beautifully crafted through a remarkable script - and very fine acting.

An ambitious movie that is better than many gave it credit for,"Not a commercial or critical hit upon initial release, Martin Brest's long in the tooth and extremely high concept re-imagining of Death Takes a Holiday has over the years remained a well-liked audience drama, even if this unnecessarily epic event has its share of glaring letdowns and mismanagement's.Well known in the industry for delivering comedy classics Midnight Run and Beverly Hills Cop and the Oscar awarded Scent of a Woman (let's just forget about Gigli shall we?), Brest has proven to be a capable director across a range of genres and its through his keen eye and commitment to remain resolute throughout the very odd happenings in Meet Joe Black that the film remains a watchable experience, even when things appear as though they're set to be derailed at any given minute.Talking about the film via the written word makes one wonder how on earth such a plot could come to life, with Black's mix of family drama, businesses takeover potboiler (a real anchor to the film), love story and rumination on life and death ensuring that 3 hours of should've been edited film is taken up in all instances, with its capable cast showing a commitment to the cause that showcases its clear many believed in what they were working on.Remaining a stoic presence throughout and delivering a typically assured performance as wealthy businessman coming to terms with his mortality William Parish, Anthony Hopkins is on fine form here, while the arguably never better Claire Forlani as his daughter Susan reminds us all that her career appears to have been an opportunity lost as she now flounders in direct to VOD fare, leaving the performance of its leading man Brad Pitt the major debating point of a film that many dismissed without ever really giving it a chance.Playing both a charismatic guy in a coffee shop that meets an untimely (and meme worthy) end after running into Susan at a New York diner and Death himself in the form of the newly minted Joe Black, Pitt's performance is quite possibly the most divisive of his mostly impressive career.It's hard to know sometimes whether what we are witnessing is one of the more awkward leading turns of the 90's or one of the most unexpectedly brilliant, with Pitt tasked with the unenviable task of showcasing what it may be like should death take the form of a strikingly handsome 30 year old single male, as Joe discovers the joys of peanut butter, French kissing and the art of tie wearing.It's a tough gig and due to the films often too mawkish in nature script and delivery, leaves Pitt hanging in the wind without a crutch to fall back on and there are often too many odd moments of Joe traipsing about in Parrish's life that leads to an extended 30 minute finale that reaches for the stars but misses by a wide amount.Throughout Brest's film however there are moments of real tender beauty, backed by a stunning Thomas Newman score and some great moments of movie making art and at its core, Black tells a well-intentioned story that will warm the hearts in various moments, a fact not many movies of this kind can attest to have done.Final Say -A story that should never work done in a way that mixes wonderment and bemusement, this overly long and sometimes poorly handled epic isn't classic filmmaking but Meet Joe Black has enough moments of joy and heart in it to warrant another go or perhaps a first time viewing for those turned away by its initially cold public response.3 delicious cookies out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Try not to insult other people's opinions!,"Please, enough with the ridiculous assumption (for this and other films) that if one didn't like it, one must be somehow intellectual or spiritually inferior to those who did. Surely you can express your opinion about a film without maligning the intelligence of those who don't share it.I saw Meet Joe Black in the theater when it came out, which was a grave error. By the last third of the movie I was literally banging my head on the back of the chair in frustration. I came close to walking out, but damn me, I had to see how it all turned out. At this point, that wasn't even worth the time really, because I can look back and say with certainty ""who cares!"". If I were Anthony Hopkins, I would have told Death to kill me now rather than living the rest of my life, if it was going to be so excruciatingly dull!Please note that when I say that the best part is when Brad Pitt gets run over with the car and thrown through the air, it's not because I want more action in a film. Action films are by far not my favorite genre. I'll take character development over explosions any day. It's simply because the ridiculousness of that moment sums up the whole futile effort that is this film! That moment actually made me *laugh*, and not because I'm cold hearted - I've cried at many a film - but simply because like everything else in this film, it was badly done and elicited the opposite effect that it was attempting to achieve.My dislike of the movie had nothing to do with my ability to grasp it's ""subtlety"". It was about as subtle as a sledgehammer. Actors staring at each other with cow eyes and waiting a minute between ever line of dialogue doesn't make that dialogue any more meaningful, just spectacularly boring.As other reviewers have noted, excising these excruciating pregnant pauses from many of the scenes might have made the film more tolerable. I definitely wish I had a fast forward button. If I had it to do all over again I would have just walked out and rented it later to watch the end and not wasted another second of my life.

"""Meet Joe Black"" gets 4 enthusiastic stars and 2 thumbs up.","""Meet Joe Black"" is one of those films that will make you smile from start to finish. With talented stars, a script rich in plot and characters, ""Meet Joe Black"" is a movie to watch.""Meet Joe Black"" is a remake of an earlier film called ""Death Takes A Holiday."" In ""Meet Joe Black"" death takes human form as he comes to see the world, with the assistance of the body he is going to take.  Anthony Hopkins adds his superstar status as the fiesty father, which he plays so convincingly.There is only one result that can come from inserting two of the most talented actors in a film that has great writing. Hopkins stars alongside Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani in one of the most romantic, intelligent and character driven movies I have seen in a long time. Excitement and pleasure were two feelings that made my heart skip a beat.When I heard Hopkins would be a part of the film, I immediately thought the amount of credibility he would give toward ""Meet Joe Black."" Hopkins is the type of actor like Robert De Niro and Morgan Freeman whose mere presence on film will alert the viewer that they will be watching a great film. Hopkins brought integrity, intelligence, and honesty to this role.""Meet Joe Black"" is truly a movie filled with romance, excitement, joy, happiness, and sorrow. Brad Pitt's approach was enjoyable to watch as he seemed to pull it off with innocence. It was like he is learning everything from scratch, though he may know more than he is letting on. Also, Pitt's performance is like a mirror image to that of Hopkins.Forlani is a vision to behold in ""Meet Joe Black"" as her beauty radiates off the screen with such heat. Forlani showcases her true ability to capture the essence of her character and portray it with innocence and sincerity. Audiences will enjoy the surprises Forlani has in store for them.""Meet Joe Black"" gets 4 enthusiastic stars and 2 thumbs up.",,Anonymous,Romance
some good points but way too long,"Overall I agreed with many of the reviews I have read - this film was way too long.  Maybe the directors were trying to get across some deep and meaningful thoughts which required length, but the plot and stereotypical characters ruined any effect for me.William Parrish is a successful, popular, clever guy who everyone likes and so in Hollywood style, has to be about to see his life's work destroyed by some young hot-shot. Of course, he's not quite perfect, preferring his younger, intelligent and fairly pretty daughter over her sister. For me, the best character was the Jamaican woman although she only appears briefly.Death taking over a human body was interesting to watch and Brad Pitt did do well in this role, giving Death the appearance of knowing language but learning to control a human body. Maybe the thought of Death being human with human emotions just unnerves me a little, but a Death which learns to be agood guy whilst on earth and fall in love just doesn't seem real to me.  And if Death exists outside of time, why worry about taking Susan Parrish with him - she'll be dead herself in the blink of an eyelid?Verdict:  save your 5 quid (and back from those cinema seats) and rent this on video when there's nothing on tele.  Or even save that and wait for it to be shown on TV.  This also has the advantage of the bathroom being close by!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
An absolute treasure,"Meet Joe BlackWhat can I say, you either hate this movie or you love it. For me, it's in my top three movies of all time. It's rare to find movies with such a unique premise (please no more superhero, cop, hospital shows/movies). The acting is superb, the soundtrack is absolutely out of this world, and the subject matter is... happily heavy?What I love most about this movie is how it simultaneously explores so many different types of relationships and storylines: the love between a father and daughter, romantic love, true love being self sacrifice, the full spectrum of emotions humans have, facing your own mortality, what it truly means to be human, leaving a legacy, the things that really matter in life, settling in love and life, the importance of passion... and so much more. Painfully breathtaking and moving, extremely emotional.I can honestly only watch this movie once every few years because it brings out such deep, raw emotions,m. I ugly cry, and I can't get it out of my head for days.It's not for everyone as it's long, a bit slow, and not action packed like most are so accustomed to these days. But if you're looking for depth, a novel storyline, a haunting soundtrack, and stellar acting, this is it. An absolute treasure.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Long, boring at parts, but when it picked up it was great","I was a little hesitant to watch this movie, seeing as how it was 3 hours long, but I decided to give it a try. As I sort of expected, much of the first part was fairly slow moving and a bit boring. But if you stick with MEET JOE BLACK, it gets a little more exciting and you'll find the story a bit more interesting.William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) is a very successful businessman who has raised a good family, had a good career and has lead a good life. Then one day, Death (Brad Pitt) comes to William and offers him more time to be alive in exchange for Parrish showing him around life. Death, using the name Joe Black, really starts to enjoy life and fall in love with Parrish's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani). When this happens, he considers changing the rules of life & death.The plot is very original and fairly interesting. I think it would have been a little less boring if there wasn't a dramatic pause between every sentence. The beginning of this movie is actually pretty good, but the rest of the first half tends to drag a bit. The second half still has similar flaws, but because the characters have been set and the plot really starts to threaten, it is a lot more interesting. I had mixed feelings for the ending. I thought it was OK, but it could have been a little better. The ending was kind of predictable, but not especially since it was hard to tell where they were going with it. Half of the movie is predictable and half of it wasn't.The acting was superb in this movie, as expected with a veteran like Anthony Hopkins and a newer, but talented, face like Brad Pitt. Hopkins, in my humble opinion, stole the show right out from under Pitt, who I think was meant to be the showcase. Claire Forlani did pretty well as the adorable girlfriend of Pitt, and I thought the Jamaican Lady, played by Lois Kelly-Miller, and was both funny and noble. I loved the scenes between her and Pitt, and I thought Pitt was very funny speaking a Jamaican accent.The character development in this movie was pretty good. It was pretty cool to see the Grim Reaper himself (Joe Black/Death) have feelings and curiosity about life, let alone fall in love with someone. You can relate to Parrish, even though he plays an old fart, because he knows that his death is coming and he is, naturally, trying to tie up loose knots. You would do this too if Death came to you and said ""Hey, you're gonna die in a week. So, how 'bout them Yankees?"" Both of Parrish's daughters represent two stereotype daughters. One was the older, favorite daughter who is struggling with her feelings about love. The other is the younger daughter who is jealous of her older sister, but is married. Again, I loved the Jamaican Lady, but I don't think I would have if it weren't for Pitt's excellent dialogue with her.If you don't like long movies, you'd better stay away from this one. If you're a Pitt fan, you'll love it because he is everywhere on this film. I'd still say this is one great film and that you should check it out, but not if you have a bad attention span.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Poker faced fantasy,Based on R2 DVD 173 minOn reading the plot for 'Meet Joe Black' I was unsure what sort of movie to expect - I mean Death to me is DEATH of Pratchett fame.This movie plays the fantasy as straight drama and does it rather well.

Beautiful,"It's just so beautiful the emotions and feelings are portrayed so well. The beauty of life is the chore heart of this movie, How knowing death changes our perspective of life. Meet Joe Black is a wonderful mixture of comedy, romance and drama and is done exceedingly wellThe ending of ""Meet Joe Black"" is a meditation not only on the beauty of life and the exuberance of passion but also of learning when to let go, to sacrifice our happiness for the hope of someone else's. It's an act of true love that makes the film's ending bittersweet but still oddly hopeful.The Chemistry between Brad Pitt and Claire forlani is one of the best on screen chemistry I've ever seen, it was completely fire we could tell everything by their eyes.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Charming and beautiful, but too long for this kind of movie.","In this film, Death takes the body of a person to be able to approach William Parrish, a media mogul to whom she asks for information about human life. Speaking in these terms, it looks like an old tale brought to this day. However, although the idea is good and the film has truly beautiful moments, its far from perfect. The film is quite elegant and has a beautiful cinematography, full of warm colors and little contrast, as if everything developed in a late afternoon or next to a fireplace. The actors are veterans that we like to see working, the environments, sets and costumes are exquisite... its good, the film has quality! Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins make a good pair when they split the screen, being able to get the best of each other, as well as being both icons of male charm, each on its own way. Claire Forlani also made a good, very restrained but strong performance, although the romance with Pitt's character is as cold and impersonal as his character. I said the movie was not perfect, remember? Beginning with the actors, Pitt made several mistakes and did certain things he shouldn't. His character is always lacking in human warmth and, if Death really wanted to learn more about humanity, this was something that should have gradually emerged in this character, especially when he falls in love. Love is the most intense and transformative human feeling and this is never suggested to us... I don't know if Pitt accepts without criticism everything directors and writers say he has to do, but it's his duty not to let his character fall, so he should have had the perception of the mistake that would be to keep such coldness from a certain point. But there are more problems: the script has an excellent main plot but is too dense and there are too many subplots, and that only helps to get the film out of focus. The director, Martin Brest, did a good job filming but clearly didn't give great relevance to pre and post production. He should have scrutinized the script better, eliminating some things, as well as requiring the editing team to cut out what was left over. And there's plenty of leftovers in a super slow movie, which drags on for three hours without any need, with overly long or ancillary scenes. It's a beautiful movie, but it's tedious to watch because we just lost the patience needed to watch something so long and so empty.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Wonderful Film,"It is rare to see a film that is as quiet as it is forceful. It's like standing before a breathtaking view alone with only the sounds of life and nature. Such a view inspires awe, reverence and silence. This comes close to the unusual feeling I get whenever I watch ""Meet Joe Black"".I had the occasion to watch it again on HBO, and I was caught up in its magic one more time.Yes, it is of ungainly length (3 hours), and it is slow by modern film standards, but it engrosses me, because it is unique. Director Martin Brest and acting heavyweights Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt make each scene so weighty and powerful that the hidden drama of Death, literally personified by Mr. Pitt's character Joe Black, presence with good man William Parrish, Anthony Hopkins, never leaves the viewers attention.Mr. Pitt acts with a gentleness and power that he has rarely demonstrated in any other character. Mr. Hopkins portrayal leaps off the screen like a force of nature equaling death, itself -- how many actors can do that?The final corporate war confrontation between the character of Drew, portrayed by gifted actor Jake Weber (from TV's ""Medium""), versus Black and Parrish is a true delight - Mr. Weber would have to be gifted to hold his own in a scene with Mr. Pitt and Mr. Hopkins (and he does so on three separate occasions in the film).Of special note is the performance by Claire Forlani, portraying the daughter of William Parrish, who falls in love with Joe Black. She has a special gentleness in her performance which makes it completely believable that if something like ""Death"" physically walked the Earth, he would fall in love with her.I wish that a film like ""Meet Joe Black"" could have reached its audience at 3 hours, like ""Titanic"", but life and the world does not work that way.I do hope anyone who reads this review, gives this film a chance, and lets its quiet passion sweep them up.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lots of eye-gazing!,"If you overlook the impossible plot and sit back and enjoy the screen presence of Anthony Hopkins and boyish good looks of Brad Pitt, ""Meet Joe Black"" is entertaining enough though at 180 minutes it's rather too long. The early coffee-shop scene which introduces the Joe Black character is most enjoyable and the parting of the ""lovers"" with backward glances is a charming interlude in the story. Then comes the traffic fatality- a sudden jolt and so unexpected. There is a lot of eye-gazing in the next two hours and very little audible conversation. There is a lot of speaking in whispers! I thought the final birthday celebrations were much overdone even for a very wealthy family, but at least the spectacular fireworks could be heard. If you watch the closing scene carefully, you will note that although the sky is filled with brilliant light from the multitude of bursting rockets, the dark figures of of Pitt and Hopkins who are walking up the stone steps of the garden are not illuminated by flashes of colour from the sky. This is a bad oversight. One expects better.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Meet Joe Black,"Meet Joe Black is a remake of Death Takes a Holiday.When this film was released it was apparently the most expensive non action movie ever made.Martin Brest has certainly made a very long romantic fantasy that is a bit of a misfire.Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) is a media mogul that is contemplating a merger with a brash rival. He is also about to celebrate his 65th birthday.His older daughter Allison (Marcia Gay Harden) is planning a lavish party where even the President might drop in.His younger daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) is training to be a doctor and is his favourite. She is in a sparkless relationship with duplicitous Drew, an arrogant executive in Bill's company.Susan encounters a charming stranger one morning in a diner. A flirt played by Brad Pitt who is suddenly run over when he later crosses the road. His dead body is taken over by Death and he later comes to visit Bill and hangs around with him for a few days. In that time Death meets Susan once more and falls in love with her.The best bit about Meet Joe Black is the big expensive party that Allison is planning. The kind of glitzy and kitschy party disgraced tycoons such as Jeffrey Skilling and Bernie Madoff used to throw with other people's money.There are no hints that Bill is a cynical manipulative power hungry media tycoon. So that part is certainly a fantasy. In fact this is one of the movie's problems. The boardroom backstabbing is boring and obvious. Bill is so passive, you wonder how he made it big in the corporate jungle.Then there is the character of Death in human form. At times knowing very little of life on Earth and at other times he is all knowing. It is bizarre storytelling.It is a muddled film with a funereal pace. Pitt struggles and even more with that Haitian accent. Hopkins does his best with little characterisation, Forlani looks pretty but failed to convince me that she was a doctor.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Great, Fun, Long Look At Death","""Meet Joe Black"" is a deliberative and contemplative story about discovering love for the first time, about passion and fire, and bursting anger.  The movie's slow pacing makes the movie's calculating business intrigue storyline even more powerful and gripping while the first half of the movie's ironic humor captures the heart of romance.  This is a great movie that gives depth to supporting characters especially the sister and the business associate (scenes which remind of ""It's A Wonderful Life"").  There is a remarkable love scene that glows with passion and emotional power without graphic sex.  And Anthony Hopkins closes in on death with a vengeance.  Brad Pitt plays a cool character that has an undercurrent of inbred superiority and hard, icy edge underneath his bewildered exterior. His role like Kurt Russell in ""Soldiers"" are both powerful performances that require a fine talent to meld the various, complex personalities on screen.",,Anonymous,Romance
"Great Acting, Slow Pace","Meet Joe Black.  Meet Brad Pitt, for 3 hours.  This is a movie that spends three hours on a screenplay that was written and rated for two.  It's a fine idea of a story.  Death (Pitt) comes to take a holiday with a dying millionaire (Hopkins) and just happens to fall in love with his daughter (Claire Forlani).  Meanwhile,a two-faced, untrustworthy man, who happens to be engaged to Forlani, attempts to steal the family business from Hopkins. Death, however, has come to save the day for Hopkins, only long enough so that he can bring him with him to the great beyond.  It's a great plot with an excellent cast.  Yet, this movie fails to deliver the goods.The main problem that this film has is that they must have fired the editor before they took the final copy to edit.  This movie is three hours long. And it's a long three hours.  As a result, it flows along like a turtle who is in a hurry to get to the end of a mile long stretch.  Some scenes are painfully long.  I kept waiting for something to happen that would move it along, but it never came.  The climax of this film (you know, the part where all of the movie's problems get solved) lasts well over an hour.  I kept waiting for it to end, but it kept on going.Many women that I've discussed this movie with think that it's the greatest movie they've ever seen.  Why?  Simple...Brad Pitt.  I keep thinking that if they hadn't cast Brad Pitt in the lead, this movie would have been a complete failure.  I like Brad Pitt, and I find that he has great acting skills and an ability to captivate his audience by his charm and good looks. His presence somehow makes this movie tolerable.The guys in the audience will find newcomer Claire Forlani equally attractive.  She offers a stunning screen presence and surprisingly good acting skills.Hopkins, of course, is a genius of an actor.  He brings credibility to this movie.  Who else could play a millionaire with such style and finesse in such an honorable way.  Once again, he provides a great performance.I gave this movie a 6 for the following reasons.  High marks for the exceptional acting from Hopkins, Pitt, and Forlani; and a clever idea of a script.  Low marks for the slowness of its pace.  All in all, it's a better than average film that is dragged down by it's length and pace.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Sir Anthony Hopkins is, by all rights, one of the best actors still performing.  Claire Forlani is a beautiful actress that has a brilliant career ahead of her.  And of course there is Brad Pitt who has put out a decent amount of credible work. Even with this kind of acting muscle behind it the movie wasn't the gripping story that it should have been.Most of this comes from the fact that the movie has such a dark undertone to it.  There isn't any real sense of joy at any point.  Even the love scenes between Pitt and Forlani leave you feeling as though it was just a cold exchange between two people weary from the troubles of their lives.  There just isn't any chemistry behind the two of them.The story also tends to drag on.  A little more editing should have gone into the movie to get it to move a bit better.

Brilliant.,A powerhouse masterpiece. Nothing is out of place in this story. It's brilliant. The emotions build up relentlessly towards the finale. We the viewers know a secret that most of the characters in the film don't.

In particular toward the end, with its long, lingering close-ups which are totally unnecessary. I found my attention wandering in a ""Yeah, alright, we GET it"" kind of way. It was almost as thought the director really wanted his money's worth of two good-looking actors. Half an hour could easily have been trimmed off the end which would've seen us all off to bed earlier and with greater satisfaction.Still, it has everything you ever wanted to know about love but were afraid to ask.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

A very nice and charming romance tale.,"This is a very nice and charming romance movie, a story about media tycoon William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) who is visited by Death itself, in the form of Joe Black (Brad Pitt). His intention was to take William with him, but William's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) has met the man that Joe Black resembles and she falls in love with Joe, changing the life and death course of events.More than a romance and love story, this film delves into the mystery of death, creating a suspenseful plot that I've found made the movie intriguing. While Joe's visit was to take William with him, it is interesting to see what he chooses to do throughout the course of the movie when he establishes a love connection with Susan.The acting is pretty good for the most part, albeit wooden at times, and there are some slow, filler scenes, but not enough for me to think the movie was boring.

"A warm and moving portrayal of love, life and all the passion it brings.","I found this film both moving and funny. There were superb performances by all members of the cast (notably Sir Anthony Hopkins) and the love story between Forlani and Pitt contains a real, humanistic, passionate element. Admittedly the time could have been reduced somewhat, there is often long, unnecessary silences and a few sub-plots that could have been removed. The film is however highly amusing if you allow yourself to be open to the humour. Pitt's portrayal of death is amusing, warm and well attempted since he couldn't exactly research the part! Hopkins, as always, gives a powerful, moving performance which really holds the rest of the cast and Forlani plays her part with a quiet dignity that suits Susan. Overall, the film may be a bit too long, but it is time well spent in this warm-hearted portrayal of love, life, and death.",,Anonymous,Romance

However, death (Brad Pitt) decides that with this customer he wants to take a look at what life is like, and so spends a few days with the Parrish family. The film is done in a very dreamy style throughout, with a masterful soundtrack by James Horner which massively adds to the films dream-like feel. This is not the sort of film which you should go into expecting an exciting piece of cinema.

It's too long, yes, and filled with pregnant pauses that don't always deliver brilliant offspring. But there are aspects of this film that provide the kinds of goods that cinema has always provided since the days of Valentino and Pickford: Beautiful people to look at. Claire Forlani is very appealing, and Brad Pitt is the best looking man in the movies today. Not enough?OK. Anthony Hopkins is fine as the powerful media magnate who is bound for Jordan's banks. Without him this film could have been a chore.Brad Pitt's character in the beginning of the film is very winning, but he disappears when Death takes him over. The Death character is less appealing and Pitt struggles with it, not always successfully. His best moments are the scenes with a dying Jamaican woman in a hospital. There his liveliness and intensity are evident. Of course, being Death, how lively can he really be?And it's too long. Did I mention that?The sub-plot about the boardroom takeover is somewhat labored and feels inorganic to the rest of the story. However, taken as a whole, this film is better than the critics are giving it credit for.It's just too damn long.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great performance from Anthony Hopkins,"Anthony Hopkins excels in the role of a wealthy businessman, both in his scenes of business dealings and his relationship with family and his guestI also enjoyed the performances of Forlani, Harden and Tambor, I was not 100% keen on Brad Pitt's performance but I think this was writing and direction rather than the actor. For example, I found some of the hospital scenes somewhat nails on chalkboard.There is good writing elsewhere however. There is an engaging plot - although you are left filling in blanks with regard to why characters do not act differently and also you are thinking at the end - so.....this is going to be tricky, what happens next?There is a good tale of romance.I liked the indoor swimming pool which I read was made especially for the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Not for Shallow, Thoughtless or Insensitive Individuals...","This is a movie only for individuals who possess layers below their skins where the eyes cannot discern or the hand cannot feel, for individuals who possess layers below their hearts where the soul only reaches and the mind cannot fathom.I wallowed in the gentle and peaceful pace of this movie.  I entered into it's even breath, into it's solemn hope and I came away with more life than I had before.I can only pity those individuals who cannot sit back for just three hours of their lives and slow down to take in every nuance that this movie has to offer.We are becoming accustomed to movies which move faster than the clip of a music video.  It is remarkable that when offered a movie faster and wilder than a music video, most of the public could not take it.  That movie was ""Moulin Rouge"".  It was too fast, they said.  Balderdash!

"""BACKGROUND"" MUSIC ?","Some may not like this film because it's a bit slow and thoughtful; I pity them. It's actually a rather nice example of how films used to be made, films that had less ""crash, bang, wallop"" and a little more story, acting and dialogue.Anthony Hopkins, as always, is excellent; Brad Pitt, despite what some reviewers have said and despite my own mild aversion to him as a modern day, pretty boy method actor, is actually not at all bad and the supporting cast is also more than adequate. Yes, the story is a bit cheesy but since when did every film have to carry some sort of deep message ? This one has a rather old fashioned sentimental, romantic bent and it's none the worse for that; the musical accompaniment is dated, but isn't it so much better than the modern garbage ?I would have really loved this film except for one thing - the sound quality. The musical background so often drowns out the soft, half mumbled speech of the characters - is it my television or my ears ? No, I've no problems with either, so it's down to the production.While Hopkins delivers his lines clearly, for the most part, Pitt and Claire Forlani, both speak so quietly, or mumble US style, as to make their words almost unintelligible under the horribly loud ""background"" music. I love the music, but I'd really like to hear the words of the actors too.I think it's a rather lovely film; simple and straightforward. It has messages about love and family, loyalty and betrayal, honesty and deceit, but none of these take over. No one turns up to shoot the bad guys or rescue the good ones; it's old fashioned sentimental schmaltz. It would certainly be worth an 8 if it wasn't for that bloody annoying ""background"" music, so it's only a 7 from me, though I'll watch it again, and again, and again ---------------- .",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

An excellent chosen cast makes this an enjoyable movie.,"A good movie. Not outstandingly excellent, but truly enjoyable. The cast choice was however above the average. Not one character was out of place. Sir Anthony (as William) was the highlight - again, of course, but Ms Forlani(as Susan), a first timer to me, played her role with passion. To me the other two outstanding choices for their roles were Jake Weber (as Drew - really very good) and Jeffrey Tambor (as Quince). Mr Pitt (as Joe Black) was acceptable. His character did however not give him space to get his head out of the clouds  -  and this floating-in-heaven look on his face got a bit irritating in the long run. But he did good of what was expected of him. The movie's length was not a known fact to me beforehand, but at no stage did it bother me to sit so long, but some of the long scenes were too long. The quality of the depth of what was said became a bit shallower. Life always has death blowing in its neck, and those who know of the time of door-knocking in advance,  has a little advantage to put quality into what is left before opening the door. Joe Black's visit portrays this very good - if the supernatural parts are taken with a pinch of salt.",,Anonymous,Romance
Ruined by lead actress,"I'd have given this an 8 but for the irritating performance of the lead actress. From start to finish she simpers and bridles either through plain bad acting or in a gargantuan effort to look adorably doll like throughout the whole thing. Perhaps she overdid the botox, or suffered from constipation while filming. Whatever it was, she slaughtered the role and how Brad kept his pecker up during his scenes with her, I'll never know.Apart from that, a great film, fascinating concept, and the rest of the cast were excellent.

a three hour long movie that seemed like eternity,"By the time this movie ended, I was beginning to hope that the Grim Reaper might pay me a visit to end my misery - if he came in the guise of Brad Pitt, of course.  I don't think that I have ever watched a movie that took so long to say so little.  As a rule, I find movies that deal with the supernatural highly suspect. This is particularly true of those that try to do so in a ""user-friendly"" manner as MJB tried to do. As always, Anthony Hopkins' performance was magnificent, but, unfortunately, that was about the only thing that made this movie bearable. Brad Pitt is a very good (if not, yet, great) actor, but his talent isn't enough to shine through this dim-witted romp through never-never land. He spends most of his time throughout the movie just standing around eating peanut butter, being coyly silent and smiling like the cat that ate the canary.  The ""cafe scene"" early in the movie was very good, with good interaction between Pitt and Claire Forlani, but the rest of the movie was, well, just plain dead.

"Good movie, just dragged about undermining what could have been great","VERY few movies should be 3 hours long. The story line and characters have to be far more complex to justify such a lengthy film. Meet Joe Black is compelling and for the most part it is all well done.

"""If we lucky, maybe, we got some nice pictures to take with us...""","Brad Pitt going Jamaican isn't something I expected to see but I loved it. The premise of the movie is amazing, if you'd imagine death manifesting itself as a man, the last thing you'd think of is it becoming a love story and I'm a sucker for a love story. I love how immature to it the character was; it's someone who's been around for a long time but it's his first time in love, so he acts and feels the same way you felt about your first love in high school, makes the same assumptions and mistakes. It makes you relate to him as if he were human. I loved the conversations with the dying lady in hospital, it was insightful but what made it more is death still had a thing or two to learn about loneliness.It is an exceptionally long as far as most movies go; I thought it was going to end after the board meeting call at the party but was sad the love story was ended abruptly, fortunately there was still half an hour to go. The ending is a bit wonky, borderline of what I'd call sensible to say the least, I think it felt rushed. I don't think it could have been changed much, if Susan did go as far as to realize he was death and here for her father, it would have then made sense if she could tell the man who returned was the one from the coffee shop and that joe black was gone, along with the father... but that would mean she accepted this whole situation implausibility quickly. I don't want to think about it too much because it didn't really ruin the movie experience for me. Another movie that makes me feel like movies used to be so much better 'in the old days'.It does have a typical message you'd expect in a movie concerning death: realizing the things that really matter when you're finally at deaths door, a little cheasy but it's not enforced and I was a little more intrigued by the love story. It is extra cheesy and a little trite when thought of as either a romance or fantasy on it's own; entities like death manifesting itself as man on the fantasy side is something that's been explored, or a man falling in love with a woman on false pretense+name and it getting complicated in the end has been explored too. The acting is decent but nothing spectacular, I don't think the movie called for it though as it was minimalist. You'll find flaws if youre looking for them but I love this movie because it brings together two genres I like, fantasy and romance.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Anthony Hopkins gives his usual outstanding performance as a media tycoon who believes that his company is there for the people and not solely for profit.  He shows that his family, and friends are the most important things in his life, not his company. Brad Pitt delivers a most outstanding performance as the simple and curious Joe Black, or Death.

"Captivating commentary on love, life and death","The Grim Reaper (i.e. the Angel of Death) comes to take billionaire industrialist Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) but instead decides to take a holiday in the corporeal universe by possessing the body of a young man (Brad Pitt). Death's deal with Parrish is that, as long as he's entertained, he'll delay Bill's death. Mr. Death materializes as a mysterious stranger with child-like qualities known as 'Joe Black.' His ""holiday"" is complicated when he falls for Parrish's daughter (Claire Forlani).""Meet Joe Black"" (1998) is a re-imagining of the 1934 film ""Death Takes a Holiday"" (which I've never seen). It has the confidence to take its time at almost 3 hours, but is so captivating that it feels shorter than most 90-minute mindless flicks. The plot is reminiscent of other good ""fish out of water"" stories like Spock in Star Trek, ""Starman"" (1984), etc.Yes, it's outlandish but the film expertly presents the bizarre situation in a totally believable manner. In other words, this is indeed a serious drama, which nicely balances out the heavy moments with lighter touches. I would compare it to ""The Green Mile"" (1999), another long drama with supernatural touches and wholly captivating.Despite its fantastical premise, ""Meet Joe Black"" consistently offers profound insights to the most vital topics of the human experience - love, life, death and numerous others, e.g. betrayal, rivalry, hostility, comeuppance and the mysterious beyond. One good example is when Parrish's son-in-law (Jeffrey Tambor) offers a definition of love to Joe Black: To know the worst thing about someone and it's okay, presuming they're penitent. This is just one example; the film is filled with such insights.""Meet Joe Black"" cost $90 million to make and only made half of it back at the USA box office. Fortunately it has gone on to garner an enthusiastic following and rightly so 'cause this is a near-masterpiece of filmmaking and genuinely moving. I consider myself a masculine man, but tears flowed through approximately 1/3 of the runtime. This is a sign of a potent and affecting picture.It's a travesty that dreck like ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" makes gazillions of dollars and garbage like ""American Beauty"" are hailed as masterpieces while true gems like ""Joe Black"" are often overlooked. The good thing is that time was on Joe Black's side.

And, then, there is a young Brad Pitt, a strikingly handsome, beautiful man. He was criticized for his wooden portrayal but they missed the point. His acting was on point as he moved seamlessly from an idealistic young man facing a new life that was full of possibilities, to the embodiment of a dangerous and isolated entity seeing life for the first time through its beautiful vulnerabilities.

Is Your Time Really That Valuable?,"So many people have complained about the length of this movie. What were all these people going to do with the `offending' 45 minutes? Save the world? Find a cure for cancer--or even bunions?This movie doesn't have the pacing of Moesha (whom I admire) but why should it? To use a sports analogy, it's more like a baseball than football or basketball. It unravels at its own pace. It provides respite, not competition, to our chaotic environs.I have had the opportunity to observe a few of the Robert Parishes of the world. They are much more complicated men than how they are portrayed in Hollywood projects. This movie daringly casts a wealthy man as a deeply moral rather than corrupt.Anthony Hopkins trumpets why life is to be treasured and death despised. Why the person for you might NOT be the one right under your nose, but rather the person you have yet to really meet. That it's worth it to wait for the special somebody who makes your life more vibrant and you a better person to boot. In a world fascinated with the macabre and marketed to the ordinary, such messages are sorely needed.Being a member of the `Y' chromosome sex, I cannot truly be a Brad Pitt fan. But I must say he did a fine job and had great chemistry with the rest of the cast, all of whom were first-rate. And that death chose to experience life through the body of a morally conscious businessman (instead of a rock star) shows where this movie's values reside.Meet Joe Black was a brave and inspired movie.

Be careful when you make a deal with Death.,"Meet Joe Black (1998) -With the exception of his appearance in the 'Transformers' franchise, you can't go wrong with Anthony Hopkins, who played the death stalked William Parrish, but as I started out with this film I felt that Brad Pitt was still somewhat finding his feet as an actor with his role of the titular Joe (The Grim Reaper's alias).For me his diversity and improved acting abilities came a bit after 1998, although I did like his performance in 'Legends Of The Fall' (1994), also appearing alongside Mr. Hopkins and well worth watching.In this film he seemed to be playing the same sort of Stoner/Dude character that he had played in 'Thelma And Louise' (1991), if perhaps a tad more child like.I felt that a lot of his character and performance was akin to Macauley Culkin as Kevin in 'Home Alone' (1990) with his naïveté and with his confidence too and with hints of 'Forrest Gump's' (1994) social awkwardness as well. Throw in the fact that he was a bit like Tom Hanks' other character Josh from 'Big' (1988), a childish mind in an adult form and that strange connection with William/Bill's Daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) seemed even more inappropriate, as if she was kissing a child in a man's body, because it really did feel like that.Perhaps it was just hard to believe that Death would be so clueless about the world? He seemed to know some things when the story required it, but was also completely clueless at other times as if to show the reasoning behind his visit to Bill and his/their (I'm not sure what gender Death goes by these days) need to learn.I did like the fact that he always seemed to be eating, as Brad had also done a lot in his other films, especially 'Ocean's Eleven' (2001).And as the story progressed I also found that I could appreciate his performance and character more. I realised that it can't have been easy to play a part that didn't have any real emotional ability or idea about the range of feelings available to him, which may have been what was missing earlier in the film as he started the exploration of the world and his new body, including the emotions that came with it.I didn't think that Claire Forlani was the best actress. To start with, I quite liked that she was new to me and a different actor from the standard ladies that are usually selected for such roles, but her delivery got a bit corny as the film came to a point, although that may have been the script, which was a tad twee at times, but possibly needed to be for the subject it was covering.I couldn't help but notice that it was the sort of story that Terry Pratchett might have written as part of his many tales about The Grim Reaper's attempts to know the real world better. Of course Terry's Discworld was a very different place to this films New York and Rhode Island settings.It also reminded me of 'Sabrina' (1954) and I felt that it could have been a good vehicle for the likes of Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn or the others of that time, if it had been available to them.There were also echoes of 'Heaven Can Wait' (1943) with its look at a potential entry to the afterlife, its conditions and rules, one way or another.Initially I thought that the film was quite odd, I couldn't tell if it was a Comedy, Thriller or Horror film and the dinner conversation where Joe was still establishing what it was like to be human and basically everyone was already acting very strangely did not help to clarify that uncertainty. They also didn't seem to find Joe's lack of social etiquette that odd for most of it, which stretched belief a bit too much.I also felt that Bill's acceptance of Joe's real persona was a bit too easily submitted. I might have wanted a little bit more proof that Joe was Death before allowing him to stay in my house and around my family.The lighthearted treatment didn't totally match up with the more serious nature of the main subject matter. The juxtaposition of its humour and sobriety just didn't quite balance properly. It needed to be one way or the other.And the filter that was used was too schmaltzy in my opinion.It did get a bit more thoughtful as the event's developed, but I had expected most of them to happen.In general though the storyline was very good, the idea and concept was quite clever, it was just some of the execution that I struggled with.I wondered if it might have worked better if it had been filmed in a similar style to 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' (1993), because it had the same sort of tone and fantastic element. I could definitely see it working that way.While it was a tad slow towards its finish, I did enjoy the pace of it, the chance for it to air itself properly and go gently towards the finale, with some lovely emotion.I would definitely watch it again, because it was so simple to follow and intriguing, perhaps upon a second viewing I might appreciate it even more, because as I grew closer to the end of the film I really started to like it. It might be nice to see it without reviewing it at the same time.709.55/1000.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Mixed, but quite seductive, bag","Meet Joe Black is in many ways a wonderful movie. It is grandly, shamelessly romantic in a way few movies these days dare to be, and quite successful on that level. Brad Pitt is certainly one of our best contemporary leading romantic men, and the lovely Claire Forlani is utterly compelling, both as love interest, and as daughter to the film's real star, the incomparable Anthony Hopkins.In an age where we've come to expect virtuosic acting to club us over the head, a al Nicholson, DeNiro, Pacino, and Streep, Hopkins is a subtle master without peer. His greatest praise was for Silence of the Lambs, but his greatest role was in Remains of the Day, in which he expressed an astonishing depth of pain, solitude, and character with very few words or even over gestures and expressions. In Meet Joe Black, Hopkins gives us another magnificently etched, subtly towering performance. The theme is old and timeless: a man coming to terms with his life and imminent death. Hopkins makes it more than compelling.In tandem, both he and Forlani, and he and Marcia Gay Harden (as his less-favored daughter) create remarkably believable and beautiful father-daughter relationships. I think it is in these areas that the film is most successful (I speak as the father of two daughters myself).The film is a bit too long, and at times the writing betrays itself with a lack of subtlety. Also, while Pitt is marvelous in the Lead Romantic Male part of his role, he is not a particularly menacing Death. At times, particularly in scenes next to the Towering Hopkins, he seems positively puny.But let yourself get swept away by this film, forgive it's couple of flaws, and you'll be enormously entertained.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A fabulous film,"Although this is a 3 hr or so movie on waiting for death it is a lot more then that and is a real hidden gem. With the set design, performances and music really make this movie a enjoyable time. While death is a main theme of the movie its really a romance movie between death (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Claire Forlani). It ends up with there being a great chemistry between them with a very intense love scene. There are some real enjoying scenes where death takes the body of a human and slowly learns to be human having his boyish innocence. In exchange for a few extra days Brad and Anthony's character come to an agreement, a few extra days in exchange for a tour a life as a human. A funny scene was just seeing how much he enjoyed peanut butter and seemed to act like it was the greatest thing in the world. It is very easy to wake up every morning and complain about your life and how much better it could be. We can all find something wrong with our lives, it is human nature to. What are the things we can do to change the situation. How can we ensure that our life gets better? Is this really all that bad of a life? This movie asks us to realize that this life is a gift and we shouldn't take it for granted. Death is a by the book robot type of guy but by being in a human world acting like a human at the end he makes more of a human choice rather then a non human emotion. This movie should have won some academy awards it was deserving of so. This is a movie any movie lover should watch and have as part of their collection. Enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Multiply  by infinity and take it to the depths of forever and you will still barely have a glimpse of how disappointed i am,"Powerful characters, great acting but an average execution of the mythology of the plot spoiled it all. The message around which the plot was woven, was incredibly conducive to making a masterpiece. Certain moments in the movie felt terribly out of place with the consistent class the movie showed all along. Not to mention the ending, that was so shocking because after going through that painful moment ended any chance of the story having any depth whatsoever. If i were to suggest anyone to see this movie, i would urge them to stop the movie and return the DVD promptly and suppress any curiosity they might have of seeing the ending. This way, you will ponder about the additional dimension that the plot had but was never told. I hope this movie is remade to shatter records.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Watch this movie, ignore the bad reviews!","I was upset after watching this wonderful film, and then coming to imdb.com to look up its awards, and found that it had been nominated by Razzie awards for ""Worst Remake"" and other awards it won for worst movie! I don't understand, this was a great movie. It was slow moving, but that just added to the melancholy drama of the film. I found it moving, sad at times, funny at times, and the acting was terrific. I don't know what reasons Razzie had for ridiculing it. Furthermore, I feel it was better than some films that have won Academy Awards (Out of Africa, Titanic, The English Patient). Do not let the reviews frighten you out of watching this film! Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins were wonderful in this film, and I think that the average person that watches this film will agree with me than with the critics.",,Anonymous,Romance
Meet Joe Black,"Billionaire ""Parrish"" (Sir Anthony Hopkins) is feeling a bit under the weather as his birthday approaches, and a potential corporate merger looms too. His daughter ""Sarah"" (Claire Forlani) is, meantime, rather keen on one of his hotshot employees ""Drew"" (Jake Weber) who is a driving force behind the impending and lucrative business deal. ""Parrish"" is clearly unwell, and after a scare that looks like an heart attack, he finds a new character in his life. The blonde and piercing-eyed Brad Pitt whose purpose here is pretty clear to us, but not yet to his new friend. Hastily named ""Joe Black"" the older man starts to act as a sort of guide for the younger, who clearly his little knowledge of how the world works. ""Black"" starts to feature much more prominently in the life of the mogul and that causes consternation as he begins to display a behaviour that really contrasts with that which made him successful in the first place. That causes quite a bit of chagrin for the ambitious ""Drew"" but not as much as the attentions ""Black"" is now paying to ""Claire"" - and that are slowly becoming reciprocated, too. ""Parrish"" has, by now, begun to realise who his dashing and charismatic companion is - and has concerns about the impact this might have on his daughter should she find out. Can the pair find a way to reconcile what must be done with what they want to be done? It's quite a solid and promising story and there's quite an effective dynamic between the under-stated Pitt and Sir Anthony. It's just far too long, though. It could easily lose an hour and the plot wouldn't suffer. It's almost like a three act play that takes far too long to get going, and is really only redeemed by a delightfully conspiratorial last half hour. It's a good looking film but is too dialogue-heavy and I found myself wading through too much of it to really enjoy it. Sorry.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
MJB - sooner or later everyone does,"In my case, it was ""later"". In my harried work-every-day years - so many of them ! - I had never heard of this movie. Had I not been discussing movies I had recently purchased with a postal clerk, in an office I had used for thirty-five of those years,I would never have discovered it: she told me about it, without giving one hint of its content. I am one of those persons who can be told the entire plot without it becoming a spoiler for me. It was the look on her face when she told me, ""I really liked it,"" that gave me the intuition it was something special. She had seen it on cable-TV; I bought it on eBay, without hesitation. A movie-a-night is my passion, so I watched it the very day it came to me. I wasn't fifteen minutes into it when I became aware it WAS something special. I'm not certain I understood too much about it after my first viewing: I may have seen ""Death Takes a Holiday"", but I don't remember having seen it. I'm certainly old enough to have seen the original release.I have viewed it several times, the last half of it only minutes ago. I have read approximately half of the fifty-five pages of commentaries posted here. I read so few unfavorable ones, which I dismissed without a second thought. I agree with every favorable comment - as varied as they are, each expressing differently their passion for the film - and have learned so much I wasn't sure I understood about the story, from those comments. I totally agree it was made with extreme dedication by everyone who took part in bringing it to an audience starved for classic movie-making.The combination of Hopkins, Pitt and Forlani - who give their entire souls to this script - is dynamite, plus sumptuous scenery full of very talented people who make this film the masterpiece it is. How gratifying it is to read the glowing comments written by people who know, or recognize, what classic movies are about. Many of the piano-sketches are of a diabolic nature, but played with sweetness.It needs the full three hours of its length to let love-impossible-love flower. We can only soulfully hope its message is trumpeted around the world, that even The Angel of Death cannot overcome the ultimately consuming power of true love. I am so happy to share the mesmerizing splendor of this unforgettable film. Our love for it will keep it alive.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I cannot believe I have not yet discovered this movie but I also feel that it came to me precisely when it was meant to.

The Inevitability of Death and Taxes,"This film begins with an extremely wealthy man by the name of ""William Parrish"" (Anthony Hopkins) experiencing severe chest pains and then imagining that he hears a voice talking to him. The scene then shifts to William's adult daughter ""Susan Parrish"" (Claire Forlani) sitting alone at a coffee shop when a lonely young man comes over to talk with her for a little bit. As they converse, it soon becomes apparent that there is some chemistry between them but, as luck would have it, they each go their separate ways without actually introducing themselves to one another. Minutes later, as she walks out of view, the young man is killed by a speeding automobile. Not long afterward, while at the dining table, William Parrish hears the voice again which seems to tell him that he is waiting at the door to meet him. Quite bewildered, William asks the maid to check to see if anyone is outside and, when informed that there is, he then instructs the maid to have him wait in his personal library. To his horror, when he finally meets the person behind the voice, he realizes that he is talking to Death personified--and he has come to propose a deal in which he will allow William to live a little longer in exchange for teaching him about life. So, from that point on, William and the mysterious strange named ""Joe Black"" (Brad Pitt) become almost inseparable. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that I was incredibly impressed with this movie for the first hour or so but then I lost interest as the tone shifted and became more serious later on. In any case, despite my disappointment at the end, there is still a lot to like about this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Death takes a break...,"For me, the standout performance is Brad Pitt.His ability to portray Death as a child in a man's body and not come across as a cornball comedy piece is an exceptional piece of work.Balanced against Sir Anthony Hopkins Bill Parrish portrayal as a man who slowly begins to understand that his time is coming to an end, and you have an exquisite work of art.Those who brush this off as a powder puff romance film are wide of the mark.It's a film that works on so many levels.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Love it but is this an original screenplay????,"After all these years we have finally watched this movie. Found it quite well made and not at all too long.Brad Pitt seemed to be missing that good old ""gleem in his eyes"" in some scenes but the other characters played sincerely. Hopkins in particular was wonderful during the long last scene waiting for Joe to take him away.One strange thing was the movie left us with the impression that we have seen this story before - some old French or American movie from the 1940-50s maybe... anyone got any ideas? Nothing mentioned about this on the DVD nor here on IMDb though.P.S. IMDb why not add a link to ""this film based on ...""?

Film = philosophical lesson,"A wonderfully compelling film. To keep you interested and curious for a whole 3 hours deserves special praise from director Martin Brest. Anthony Hopkins performed at his best as he knows how, Brad Pitt opened up for me in a new dramatic role, and got into the role quite well. Even insensitive death came to our planet and felt what it was like to live in this amazingly beautiful world, that it brought tears of happiness. The film also shows human values well and raises the question: what is happiness for a person? There are still many moments that I did not understand in the film, or rather meanings, and I am on the way to searching for answers, because the film itself forces you to ask yourself questions, although simple and perhaps stupid for some, but endowed with philosophical meaning.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A pleasant surprise!,"I just finished watching this movie. What a pleasant surprise! Either it was woefully under-advertised or I was living under a rock at the time, but this movie is well worth seeing. I sat down to watch it just because it had the great Anthony Hopkins in it. I did not even know until his appearance that Brad Pitt was even associated with this project. Normally I consider Pitt a ""woman's actor"" in that he acts primarily in films that appeal to women. But occasionally he has shown flashes of talent (such as SEVEN MONKEYS), and he does again in this film. The doe-eyed beauty of Claire Forlani is the perfect complement to him. While both rich and beautiful, she comes across as someone who looks for something deeper in a man than Pitt's obvious physical charms. I am surprised she has not been in other big-budget films, since this was made in 1998. With his under-appreciated charm, Jeffrey Tambor plays his usual character of the slightly dim-witted loser, and Anthony Hopkins is good as always. But this is a star vehicle for Pitt, and he is surprisingly up to the task. I had intended to watch and discard this movie, but now it is a keeper for my video library. Guys - this is a perfect date film. We should all keep a couple of ""chick flicks"" like this on hand, that appeal to women but are more thought-provoking than just their usual Titanic-level garbage.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Death is the pace, shallow is the aim.","I really had hopes for this movie, as I think film above many arts can portray best life, death, the afterlife and things of similar magnitude. But this film was, despite the subject matter, incredibly shallow.  ""Love"" in this film was no more than one meeting, two kisses, and a long Brad Pitt sex scene.  ""Family"" was full of the touching smiles which you expect, but also functionality and trite pre-death resolutions which the viewer was expected to swallow with no satire.  This work simply scratched all of its surfaces, never letting Hopkins explore the true consequences of his life, and never letting Pitt explore real life, save all of that peanut butter he got to taste.  In short, sadly wasted potential.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A simple review of Meet Joe Black from the eyes of a teenager,"When this movie first came out I thought, "" Oh great, another hokey love story!"" However, after I finally got bored enough to go see it, I was amazed! This movie builds you up and takes you through a ride of a million and one emotions. The actors/actresses do an amazing job and give a performance that will jerk on your heartstrings. My only complaint is that this movie, like most 3+ hours films, begins to drag towards the end. However, that aside- I believe this movie is definitely Oscar material. I would recommend it to just about anyone.(Heck, my 13 year old brother enjoyed it!) Just be sure to bring along the tissues.",,Anonymous,Romance

The slow but incredible build up from a potentially boring start builds toward something that left me as one with a sense of appreciation for life and the moments within that can make it truly great.I have seen this film many times now and every time i watch it, i experience hesitation toward the end because i simply do not want it to end.

Dance of Love and Life in Meet Joe Black,"To fall in love is to lose yourself in the warmth of another person, to surrender to a feeling that makes the world both breathtaking and terrifying. Watching Joe Black and Susan navigate this bond-so pure, so uncertain-reminds us of the vulnerability and beauty of loving without restraint.The quote that remains etched in my heart-""Love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with?""-captures the essence of it all. It is the very core of what it means to love: the willingness to surrender to something greater than yourself, even knowing it may not last.Brad Pitt's portrayal of Joe Black is a quiet masterpiece, his ethereal presence making us feel the weight of mortality and the fragile nature of connection. Anthony Hopkins, with his quiet strength, brings a depth to the film, grounding it in the realities of life, loss, and the enduring nature of love. Together, they create a symphony of emotions that touches the soul, leaving a lingering warmth long after the credits have rolled.Meet Joe Black is not a film to rush through; it's a slow dance, where each movement matters, where every glance carries the weight of unspoken words. In a world that often demands speed, this film asks you to pause, to feel, and to reflect. And though the pace may be slow at times, the emotional depth makes every moment worth the wait.In the end, I give this film a heartfelt 7/10-a tribute to the love that burns brightly, to the people we lose, and to the memories that remain, etched in our hearts forever.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance

""When you find love, when you know that it exists..."" - George Michael, and yes, what a terrible amount of LOVE has created us, human beings?

A tragedy because of Pitt's 'muggingly' cute ambiguous portrayal,"What a story this could and should have been.This film is embarrasingly obvious- the antithesis of death's dual attractions as peace and inherent repellant horrors- due in large part to the self conscious Brad Pitt,
and spreading through to infect Anthony Hopkins and Jeffery Tambor.If one wants to tackle the most abstract and ambivalent
struggles of life and it's ending, he must spare at all costs
the mugging self consciousness of Pitt's portrayal of Death incarnate.Added into this is a martyred Anthony Hopkins, a truly gifted actor, who never remotely protests or questions why or how all of this supernatural mythological personification lands on him alone, and you have a pat, lazy, maudlin fantasy!When I think of what MIGHT HAVE BEEN.......",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

But I find myself deeply moved each time I view this film. It certainly doesn't hurt to have all the actors at the top of their form. Anthony Hopkins, in particular, gives one of the richest performances of his career -- as do Jeffrey Tambor and Marcia Gay Harden who shun caricature to show us that rich people can be genuine and kind. This is about the best thing I've seen Brad Pitt do; he shows a remarkable restraint that is perfectly consonant with his character. And Claire Forlani is a wonder.

Innocence Lost,"Why do people still to go to the cinema instead of enjoying the comfort, cheapness and convenience of their own TVs, VCRs, DVDs, cable or satellite movie channels? The local multiplex certainly offers the latest (but not greatest) features, the big screen, the ""night out"" achievement, and a certain social comarderie with the huddled masses in the darkened theatre. However, for this movie it is the very masses themselves that detract from any enjoyment of the film. In any given theatre, on any given evening the film will be playing to a teenage female majority, whose primary interest in the film in the presence (not ability) of Mr Pitt.

Slow to watch and Took time to finish watching it,"It is not a bad movie but awfully long (over 3 hour long :o ) for some simple yet not so special story. Way way way too long... I think I am being quite generous for rating at 6 just for the great acting of Anthony Hopkins and other actors even minor ones. Brad Pitt is very young here (more than 20 years ago) though other than these two no one special on the list of casts worth mentioning. I did like the chemistry of the younger daughter played by Claire Forlani of the chairman (Anthony Hopkins) and Mr. Joe Black (Brad Pitt). Just that the script is very poor and flat. I may leave the theater if I watched this in a movie theater instead of Netflix as it took me 5 sittings+ to complete watching it till the end. I mean unless you have endless free time people won't watch it till the end. I had nothing else to watch as movies these days that are coming out are rather lame so I watched it till the end, but I won't watch it 20 years ago (hence this was first time watching it no one talked about this) as there were other awesome movies to watch then. Is this Oscar winning movie? Nope. It is really bad script, I mean it serves no purpose really other than maybe if you are really old and near retirement age it may make you think not to take life for granted, and that is if you are a person who may have not lived the life to the fullest. But for normal people, people try to live the life fulfilled, as much as possible anyways, and make an effort to be nice to people. Even then the main character played by Anthony Hopkins didn't really change who he was drastically even though he knew he was going to pass away soon or the fate of dying (everyone dies and perish). Isn't it so American or the westerner concept that there will be a death that will come to the rich to warn he may take you, because you were a stinking rich person worthy of a certain status, ""nice worth enough person to get to know while the death was on vacation"". Seriously like I said the the storyline itself is lame. But this flat story comes to life vibrantly by great acting of Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt (who was so easy on the eyes then, no longer now...sadly), and Claire Forlani. I just wish there will be great movies coming out even now, and not have to watch a movie from over 20 years ago with some lame storyline... TLDR; If you have plenty of time and nothing worth to watch watch it you won't have anything to lose. If you are over 60 or a senior citizen you may be able to relate to the story (I am not) given you would be similar age to Anthony Hopkins when this movie came out (in 60s then he is in 80s now). Are you young and don't have much time in your hands? No, I will not recommend it. It is over 3 hours long about a rich guy who was visited by death to say good bye to his loved ones. About a fate is what this is about.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
You'll be begging for death at the end of this travesty,"In Meet Joe Black Brad Pitt plays Death who has decided, after eons of existing, to experience the human existence through an unhappy car crash victim. As his guide he chooses a filthy rich media mogul played by Anthony Hopkins. Because that's a fine sample of humanity right there. But, it just so happens that the mogul has a feisty daughter played by the lovely Claire Forlani. Hijinks do indeed ensue.This film has problems. The actors themselves are fine, yes. The technical aspects are fine, yes. Even the story is not half bad and would normally allow for an hour or two of lighthearted entertainment. Once again it's the execution that trumps all that.Because this film is ghastly boring, unimaginative, unbearable to watch and just an all-around mess. And almost all of that stems from the fact that it's Three! Hours! Long! At most it should be two, and even that would be tedious with the amount of story on display here. I mean, a firework is fun right? The shooting, the buildup of the climb and then the main thing, the explosion. Imagine all that taking ten minutes instead of seconds. That's how this movie felt to me. And why is it so long? Because apparently the director doesn't know the word ""cut"", leading most scenes to go on a minute or two too long. Including fifteen minutes dedicated to peanut butter and a sex scene that has us staring at Brad Pitt's bulging eyes for another fifteen minutes. Oh I'm sure the scene lasted for a couple of minutes at best, but it sure felt like an eternity.It also doesn't help that the film is positively diabetic. Especially the ending, which tries so hard to be emotional and heartfelt that I feel sorry for it. Because it isn't. It's manipulative, forced and banal. I'm sorry, ending, that's the truth.Meet Joe Black has its fans and in some sick manner I can even see why.

Wasted Potential,"If there's one thing I can't stand in a film, it's when you have the feeling that this could have been a brilliant film, but some one along the line messed it up and now it's mediocre. I find those films harder to watch than the average twelve in a dozen action flix because I hate it when potential is wasted. And that's basically the story of Meet Joe Black.It's slow, beautiful, and in places very intense. No special effects apart from some fireworks (I think that is worth a special mention these days), long studies of the emotions that play over the faces of the main characters. But it just doesn't make it really good. The long pauses have you grip your seat in frustration, the subplot involving a hostile take-over is just plain silly and messes up the main plot too much, and finally and most importantly the lines of Death are just not well thought out.For some one who has looked at mankind since the beginning, he is surprisingly stupid. But if the plot requires, suddenly Death has the insight of ages again. I can imagine him marveling at new experiences such as taste and having a human body with tons of hormones running wild in it, but the script has him react like a total moron half of the time.I can see why my friends, and so many other viewers liked it. But I left this film utterly frustrated and gave it a harsh verdict for not making what could have been a great film.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's Retrospective Masterpiece,"I watched this film for the first time many years after its release and at first watch I was blown away. Despite its 3hr run time, it's paced beautifully and never lets go of your attention. The 3 leads give what I consider the performance of their lives. This is Brad Pitt in his prime. The story telling is sublime. Heartbreaking, mesmerising. It's poetry on film. If all that wasn't enough, let's talk about the soundtrack! There are no words for what I feel toward Thomas Newmans ability to capture every single sense of being without saying a word. It's legitimately the greatest score ever made.What is shocking to me is the reception this film got upon release. I can't imagine anyone watching this and being left with any other felling than a greater appreciation for life. I have no idea what those people saw back then. Maybe we've evolved as a species and that frontal lobe is a bit more active, who knows.It's a solid 10/10 movie and probably my favourite film ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Death has never been sexier,"I was never a Brad Pitt fan until this movie. He truly makes you fall in love with Death. Pitt gives Death an innocence that draws you in. One think of Death as a worldly being but we find that he has never experienced many things that humans take for granted. Things like love, security and friendship. St first he comes off as heartless having killed a young man for his body. He is uncaring in his first approach to Mr. Parrish, allowing him to fell the pain will come with is death. Then we see his kindness in the hospital when he talks to the elderly black woman and calm her fears. He learns why humans risk everything for just a little more time with those they love.My favorite scene is when Black enters the kitchen look for a snack. He is offered some peanut butter and he asks for it on ""just a spoon"". I've never found peanut butter sexier. You can't help but grin as he asks for peanut butter while at a fancy dinner, once again stating ""just a spoon"".Enough about Death. Hopkins as a man who knows his time has come is outstanding, as Mr. Hopkins always is (has he ever made a bad movie?) I did find Claire Forlani's portrayal of Susan Parrish was a bit off. I think she was trying to mimic the innocence in Pitts character but it lacked something. I really haven't been able to put my on it but it just doesn't play right opposite such great performances.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Magnificent....,"This is truly one of the most fascinating and enjoyable love stories i have seen in recent times. I was completely captivated by the relationship between JB and Susan... their love for one another transcended all that stood between them, it was unending, unconditional, true love. It did not matter that Joe was essentially death this was irrelevant to what Susan and Joe felt for each other. Finally, i was extremely impressed by the performances by all in this movie, and in particular that of Claire Forlani. Her performance as Susan captured me in a way which few actresses can do. She was magnificent.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"One short life, one long movie","Although the movie is about a patriarch (Anthony Hopkins as Bill Parrish) facing Death, it isn't a philosophical dive into mortality. It's a romance. And it's a remake: in 1934, ""Death Takes a Holiday"" with Fredric March ran 79 minutes. Playwright Maxwell Anderson and veteran screenwriter Gladys Lehman gave director Mitchell Leisen a tight script and a box-office hit. ""Meet Joe Black"" drags on for three hours.It is not really about mortality, as I said, but it does reach for profundity. Unfortunately, the closest it comes is this: ""Multiply it by infinity, and take it to the depth of forever, and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I'm talking about."" Joe Black says that about death; Bill says it about love, to warn Joe away from his daughter Susan. Either way, it's hokum.Plenty of talent went into this venture, which is pretty standard Hollywood fare: ultra-rich people surrounded by underlings who are either loyal or parasitic. Jake Weber is pitch-perfect as a young exec ambitious to gain Bill's job and Susan's bed. I don't know whether to congratulate or berate Marcia Gay Harden for accepting the humiliating role of Bill's other daughter, a grown woman (and shameless materialist) who still calls him Daddy.But the movie belongs to Hopkins and Pitt, and especially Pitt. Not that he's the better actor; they're both strong. But at the height of his boy-toy beauty, Pitt lands firmly in the double role of two resolute men: first as the charming fellow whose life is cut short in a street accident, then as Death who takes over that fellow's body but knows nothing of the spirit inside it. So he wings it, learning along the way. It's no small feat to bring Death to life.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

No doubt, the combination of Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins proved again(after 'The Legend of the Fall')the best of the best combination in Hollywood.This movie is all about emotions - Love,Life and Sacrifice - but these emotions has been presented so deeply in this film that I found the new meaning of these words.

What a drama. What kind of movie does without it?One of the disadvantages is timing. For 3 whole hours. The story is interesting, of course, but sometimes you can get bored.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Another Great Concept Fails to Deliver,"I remember seeing the trailer for this movie a handful of years ago, but only saw it for the first time recently. My expectations for this film were higher than usual: with Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt highlighting a film that paints itself very clearly as philosophical rather than entertaining, I put on my 'literary analyst' cap and popped the DVD in, ready to delve into whatever notion of Death the movie was ready to explore. Even if I'd kept my standards at par, I'd still have been disappointed.The obvious problem with this film is that it drags. On. And on. And on. This movie would have been absolutely incredible had there been at least an hour and a half less of it. What I was expecting was the Death character questioning or bringing about questions of mortality or family or SOMETHING. Instead he mostly wonders around with a blank stare while obscenely rich people mutter angrily behind his back. There are at least four plot lines going on simultaneously: we have Anthony Hopkins taking death around the world because apparently even Death gets bored sometime, his daughter throwing the Party of the Milennium for Daddy much to his chagrin, a backstabbing employee trying to Oust the Old Boss and Become the New Boss, and the Love Story between non-manic daughter and Death, who has found love. Right away we can (and the producers should have) eliminated the business side of things; it did nothing at all for Pitt's character, except for the last scene which, I will admit, was nicely done, and also tacked on much of the extra mileage of this movie. The love story was fairly well handled.It was the ending, though, that was the final, crushing blow. After a long, long, LONG drawn-out film I was expecting at least some brilliant moment of realization, some philosophical monologue, something. No, the ending...is rushed. It's as if the director finally realized that he ran long...two and a half hours (or thereabouts; it felt like two and a half) into the film. So, instead, anything any of the characters were supposed to have learned must be inferred via subtext.This had all of the potential to be an amazing film. The idea was flawless, the cast was brilliant...and it flopped. See it to believe me, but I guarantee you won't watch it twice.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"As opposed to other reviews I've read, I truly liked this movie...","Um, a lot of people seem to dislike this film, but I can't agree on any point with them...

I'm not going to tell anything about the final scene of the movie because I don't want to spoil anything for the people that would decide to see it. Pitt acts quite convincingly to me (he plays Death, who took over somebody's body, it's normal that he acts weird as he doesn't even know how to sit down on a chair...)

Very touching and beautifully done,We have watched it SEVERAL times.A well played out movie with a beautiful score.I was so intrigued by all performances and was literally drawn in and convinced of the feeling of newity (not sure this is a word but works for me) in Joe Black's experiences. Witty and charming like a child was he.Then of course Anthony Hopkins was great as usual.

Death. Love. Life.,"A very young Brad Pitt plays the role of ""death"" as he happens to fall madly in love with the daughter of the man whom he's supposed to take away from Earth. It's a very long three hour movie but the ending's payoff is very well worth the watch! There's a shorter version out there if you're willing to search for it due in part to airplane viewings when the film first came out. Lots of great undertone humor that highlights Pitt's upcoming acting career. You should enjoy this one if you have a good heart 💓",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
An interesting depiction of death,"Bill, a very wealthy and important person is about to receive an unexpected visit from a very unexpected person. The guy in question is no other than Death itself (as Joe Black), who came to ""collect"" him. Thankfully, Joe isn't in a hurry and the longer Bill is able to keep him entertained, the longer he lives. Thus, Bill must integrate Joe in his family, buying himself time to fix the remaining problems in his life.It features a lengthy but interesting plot about a man who must keep his integrity while the impersonated death infiltrates into his life and family, threatening him with every move. It's twisted and nonlinear, maintaining suspense and interest throughout its length, keeping you lusting for the upcoming finale. Its love story brings some needed romance into the picture, completing the wonderful atmosphere transmitted by this film. A very enjoyable movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too human,"This movie wanted to say so much, but in the end didn't say anything.Especially the final sequence shows a very human perspective on life which is imposed on Death. Since the human brain can't grasp the idea of ""infinity multiplied by the depth of forever"", it has to operate within the paradigm it understands. Arguing, bargaining, threatening, befriending death; this all is what people wish to be able to do; moving it to tears. But it's not what it is really like.The one thing that amused me, was that Will's birthday party randomly reminded me of Bilbo's 111th birthday 😀 cake, music, fireworks. Than the speech and he dissappears.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
A stunningly good movie for evolved souls,"I've just seen the 3-hour version of Meet Joe Black for the second time. It improves with re-viewing. What I find amazing about this story, and about the way it has been executed on film is its gorgeously rendered mix of: subtle yet passionate performances (all of them, including supporting cast), perfectly chosen and applied music, idealistic but utterly believable characters whom you wish you knew personally and whom you can care about, and the ""production values"" (rich yet subdued cinematography ~ in particular the graceful, gradually unfolding, almost spiritual PACE that is so well geared to this story, rather than to the ""attention span of a flea"" unfortunately created within so many movie viewers by their having been bombarded with 30-second TV ads for their entire lives. (READING an actual book REALLY takes a lot of time too, this is called ""literature."") Hence, most likely, the complaints about this movie being ""too long,"" which I find utterly baffling. In the hands of a lesser director and producer, the special effects geeks might also have slimed their way into this production and removed all traces of subtlety. Hooray ~ this DIDN'T happen, either. And, since the major characters are all gradually revealed as being awake, conscious, perceptive beings (as well as being complicated flawed human beings) ~ none of them are forced to fit into the false American ""belief"" that bigger and faster are automatically better (they aren't). In summary, this is a delicious meal of a movie for grownups who love a good story and who don't cynically believe that idealism, love and spirituality are ""boring.""",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Too Many Cooks Spoiled the Broth,"A beautiful film, at times.  Director Martin Brest hit his stride with ""Scent of a Woman,"" and that style is evidenced here-- the scene when the young Ms. Parrish meets the Man in the Coffee shop, at the beginning, is a truly beautiful scene, and it is moments like this that the director, and the film, thrive upon.The moment immediately after it, coupled with the ending of the film, simply do not gel.  Without giving the ending away, there was simply no thought put into it.  Every individual moment in the film works superbly on its own terms, but as a whole, the film fails.  This can only be the fault of *SEVEN* credited screenwriters, four people trying to update a screenplay written by two people, working from a play written by a single man. Hollywood overkill in its purest form.This film was great, almost.  One more rewrite and it could have been there, it's a pity this version got made.  It's like a really beautiful sports car, excellent interior, exterior, sound system, but it's missing a radio.  You can enjoy it on so many levels, but it really feels like it's missing something.7/10, and a wish that Brest reads his next script before he shoots it.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A Profound Exploration of Life, Love, and Legacy","""Meet Joe Black"" is a cinematic gem that transcends the typical boundaries of romance and drama, offering viewers a deeply moving and thought-provoking experience. Directed by Martin Brest, this film stars Brad Pitt as Joe Black, a mysterious figure who enters the life of media mogul William Parrish, played by the incomparable Anthony Hopkins. As Parrish approaches his 65th birthday, he is confronted with the inevitability of his own mortality, setting the stage for a narrative that is as introspective as it is captivating.One of the most compelling aspects of ""Meet Joe Black"" is its exploration of the human condition. The film delves into themes of mortality and the fleeting nature of life, prompting viewers to reflect on their own existence and the legacy they wish to leave behind. The character of Joe Black, who is revealed to be Death personified, brings a unique perspective to these themes. His interactions with Parrish and his family are not just about the end of life, but about the beauty and significance of living fully.Another unexpected theme in the film is the innocence and curiosity of experiencing life for the first time. Joe Black, despite his ominous role, exhibits a childlike wonder as he navigates the human world. His fascination with simple pleasures, such as tasting peanut butter for the first time, adds a layer of charm and humor to the narrative. This juxtaposition of Death's omnipotence with Joe's naivety creates a poignant commentary on the value of everyday moments.The film also tackles the complexities of love and relationships. Susan Parrish, portrayed by Claire Forlani, finds herself drawn to Joe Black, unaware of his true identity. Their evolving relationship is a testament to the unpredictable nature of love and the profound connections that can form under the most extraordinary circumstances. The chemistry between Pitt and Forlani is palpable, adding depth to their characters' emotional journey.Visually, ""Meet Joe Black"" is a feast for the eyes. The cinematography captures the opulence of Parrish's world while also highlighting the intimate moments that define the film's emotional core. The score, composed by Thomas Newman, perfectly complements the film's tone, enhancing its reflective and melancholic atmosphere. The film also features a great unforgettable performance by supporting actress Marcia Gay Harden in a very authentic role as well.""Meet Joe Black"" is more than just a romantic drama; it is a meditation on life, death, and the enduring power of love. Its rich themes and stellar performances make it a must-watch for anyone seeking a film that resonates on a deeper level. Whether you are captivated by its philosophical musings or simply enjoy the enchanting performances, ""Meet Joe Black"" is a timeless classic that will leave a lasting impression.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great beginning, good middle, slow end","In this movie Brad Pitt plays Death on vacation in a human body.  I have to start out by saying that the car accident in with which he obtains his host is the best RTA I have ever seen comitted to film.  Genuinely disturbing, but not as disturbing as the people who insist on laughing at unfunny things in the cinema.Following from the interesting beginning the movie moves slightly into 'fish out of water' mode.  However it dabbles in this genre just the right amount. It doesn't go overboard as you would expect in a kids' film, and these moments show Pitt at his best.As we approach the middle of the film, the romantic interests come out and things do start to slow down.  Some scenes are torturously drawn out and over-long.Having been charmed by Pitt's character, we now come to realise that by not being human Pitt doesn't just not know which knife to use at dinner, or what peanut-butter is, but he doesn't understand the love or comittment that humans can demonstrate for each other.  He doesn't realise that human beings are not toys that you can just take without paying for.Come the latter part of the movie things have all but ground to a halt. This movie could easily lose half an hour.  It is very unfortunate as the ending *is* good, just tainted by the length of time taken to resolve plot points.All in all quite an original film, but you are forced to suffer somewhat before they give up the goods.  Kinda like having to wait in a long queue to go on a rollercoaster ride, or having to sit through a time-share demonstration before you get to pick up your free prize.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the most romantic and sentimental movies ever..,"Meet Joe Black is a very original movie. Sure there are movies who resemble the sort of situation (City of Angels, Sixth Sense). But the acting in Meet Joe Black surpasses every one of them, for as far as I'm concerned.The story might be a little unbelievable, but that's ok. The storyline isn't really what counts here. It's the excellent dialogues between Pitt, Hopkins and Claire Forlani (what a discovery !!) that make this movie worthwhile.The whole film is set on a very emotional edge. You feel you could cry any moment. Pitt is so magnificent as the shy and inverted Joe Black. Forlani is a sight for sore eyes, and Hopkins, what can I say ... nothing but good things. Great things.I've heard that many people found Meet Joe Black a bad movie, that it was too boring, or too long. Well in my opinion that's so untrue. The 3 hours are very worthwhile, you must not be put down by the long dialogues, or by the romantic, dramatic undertone.Meet Joe Black is also one of the few movies that I actually cried at the end. Really cried. The ending is so beautifull, so amazing.I recommend this movie very highly. It's in my top 10 of all time, but beware, this movie is not to the likings of everybody, only to those who truly appreciate great filmmaking.",,Anonymous,Romance

If the businessman will give Death a tour of life, his death will be suspended until after he celebrates his birthday.During his time on Earth, Death learns about matters of the heart and soul, as well as what peanut butter tastes like.Although this is a flawed film -- mainly its length -- it is filled with charm and old-fashioned fun.Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins have worked together before, in the award-winning ""Legends of the Fall,"" and they work well together.The screenplay is flawed in that it stretches a rather thin story out to its limit, but the actors make the most of it.

"Gently paced, emotional comedy drama","""Meet Joe Black"" is well written, gently paced, very funny and very touching with tremendous performances from Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani and Brad Pitt.Yes, I said Brad Pitt gave a tremendous performance as Death-Joe Black/Young-Man-in-Coffee-Shop.  He plays the part of Death using Brad Pitt's classic body as if he has never been in a human body before.  As an actor playing this role, Brad Pitt chose to walk stiffly with virtually no mannerisms as if he were a spirit inhabiting an unknown organism.  I enjoyed watching him act out the consequences of this decision. He is also very funny throughout the movie acting in ways unlike any of the other characters.  He especially stands out from the crowd in the boardroom scenes.  He is amazing in scenes with a hospital patient who has recognized him for what he is.Anthony Hopkins is marvelous as William Parish, head of Parrish Communications.  Parrish finds out a few days before his 65th birthday that Death will take him as soon as Death is done experiencing life on earth.  He knows the penalty for arguing the Death-Joe Black is instant death, and yet he stays true to himself to the end.  This is seemingly casual performance by Hopkins is very strong.  His heart attack sequence early in the movie is gut wrenching. He is tender with his daughters, decisive with his board of directors and mystified by his relationship with Death.Claire Forlani is a find as Parrish's favorite daughter.  There is a cool, reluctant and yet trusting chemistry between her character, Susan, and Joe Black.  Their body language is enhanced by close camerawork in tender scenes, slow moving, emotion-filled scenes.The movie is long.  I looked forward to spending 174 minutes with Brad Pitt. But I hated his last movie with Anthony Hopkins (""Legends of the Fall"") so was instantly wary when I heard about the running length.  Watching the film, I loved the care the directory takes with each scene, each line of dialogue, each nuanced use of the word ""yes"".  The script is excellent.  The ending was very satisfying.  The film requires thought from the moviegoer. Some folks may not get the nuances, and may miss one of Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins best movies.

Love is an obsession with the person in whom your life is,"This is one of those films that leaves a profound mark on the soul, sends shivers down your spine, and makes you feel every emotion as if you were living it yourself. Each moment of this masterpiece is filled with such delicate harmony that your heart beats in tune with what unfolds on the screen. The film deserves endless applause-director Martin Brest has created not just a movie but a true work of art, rich with meaning and emotion.The impeccable performances of the cast are awe-inspiring, as each actor seems to seamlessly blend into the story. Every role, whether minor or central, is crafted with such precision and soulfulness that even the smallest details leave a lasting impression. Who could forget the kind-hearted kitchen assistant with his warm gaze introducing Joe to peanut butter, or the scheming and deceitful Drew (Jake Weber), whose repulsive nature evokes strong emotions? Particularly moving is the portrayal of Allison (Marcia Gay Harden), Parrish's eldest daughter, who loves her father selflessly and takes care of him, even knowing she holds a smaller place in his heart than her younger sister. Her devotion and warmth are truly admirable.The film is imbued with the theme of deep and genuine love: between Joe and Susan, between Parrish and his late wife, whose memory he cherishes with reverence, and between father and daughters, who each express their affection in their own way. Even Death itself, choosing Parrish as its guide, reflects a love for life and a respect for its beauty.The three central characters-Joe, Susan, and Parrish-elevate this story into a true masterpiece. Anthony Hopkins as Parrish is captivating: his portrayal of a powerful tycoon who built his empire with his own hands, a strong and resolute man yet warm and loving, is performed with incredible depth. His helicopter monologue, infused with belief in the power of love, is especially memorable.Brad Pitt as Joe crafts the enigmatic figure of Death, who explores human life with awe and wonder. His transformation from a charming young man to a mysterious emissary from another realm is so natural that it feels as though he belongs to both worlds.Claire Forlani as Susan enchants with her grace, purity, and sincerity. Her expressive eyes and refined demeanor bring a unique magic to the role. This is undoubtedly one of her best performances, revealing her rare emotional sensitivity as an actress.Every scene between Joe and Susan is imbued with an invisible connection and endless tenderness. It feels as if you are living those moments alongside them, immersing yourself in their world, filled with love, longing, and hope.This film is an immortal masterpiece that has held a special place in my heart for many years. Each rewatch evokes the same powerful emotions as the first time. I wholeheartedly recommend experiencing this film at least once in your life to fully grasp its strength and beauty.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not bad at all!,"It was a social film which also had its funny and sad moments although some were a bit frightening if you really think about it (i.e. falling in love with ""death""...).  However, it is something similar to ""City of Angels"" except that Death comes to earth instead of an Angel. Also the name of the guy at the cafeteria was never mentioned throughout the film. But a very good performance was played by Brad Pitt. The way he changed characters as if he really was a different person was exceptional. Overall, it wasn't bad. It was a movie with real life moments like having to deal with the fact that one day you're going to die only this time you know when!",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Stunning, but not everyone's cup of tea!","Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani and Brad Pitt - brought together under the direction of Martin Brest paves the way for an emotional and frankly quite compelling love story where Brad Pitt pays the cleverly unusual role of Death as ""Joe Black"".Having assumed the body of a recently deceased earthling (which I won't elaborate on), Joe explains to ""Bill Parrish"" (Anthony Hopkins) that he wants to spend some time in the life of the famous millionaire, to experience the way of life - the key being that as long as Bill Parrish can keep Joe Black ""interested"" he gets to defer his pending heart attack.Sounds simple enough but Bill's sweet daughter ""Susan Parish"" (Claire Forlani) sitting at the dinner table when Joe arrives complicates this otherwise simple theory (as love tends to do!)This is a very long film - perhaps a little too long to maintain the interest of some viewers.If you get through the first 15 or so minutes of this film (the coffee shop and associated scenes) and find it enjoyable the rest of the movie will simply fall into place. There are a few sub-plots hatching concurrentlyHaving browsed other reviews, it is obvious Meet Joe Black won't appeal to everyone.I think it's a great film. The cinematography is excellent and I thought the acting was very strong.And the amazing level of humour brought into the film by Brad Pitt once he starts playing the presumably undefinable role of Death finished it off perfectly.Oh, and the music... Memorable soundtracks are few and far between. With the exception of 2 out of the 20 tracks they are all original compositions composed and conducted by Thomas Newman. As orchestral staff goes I thought they were stunningly appropriate - certainly emotion provoking without a doubt.Soundtracks are designed to enhance the movie experience - and this one achieves that. Having seen the movie (DVD), listened to the soundtrack a number of times - then actually watched the movie again I was quite amazed to find the second watch better than the first.I'd give it 9 out of 10.Stunning!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful film to watch.,"I'm not a big fan of love stories. I only like two--""UNTAMED HEART"" and ""MEET JOE BLACK."" They are on opposite ends of the spectrum in the sense of story and production. UNTAMED HEART is a relatively low budget movie shot in a way to make it feel real. It was filmed in a real middle-class neighborhood and the characters were lower middle class. It was an absolutely sweet story. MEET JOE BLACK is all about extreme wealth, very beautiful powerful people, and the whole story is a fantasy. In both films, the couple in love project innocence and are compelling to watch. In a interview, Brad Pitt said that his mother wanted to see him a movie in which he looked good. Well, he never looked better. The girl is just as lovely and charming as any film character created for the screen. The only way to watch this film is just to buy into it and enjoy each frame. If you analyzed the story seriously, it's full of holes. So don't ruin your experience. Just listen to the beautiful score, engage the credible performances, embrace the classically simple but effective directing, and as with any good love story worth it's salt, bring a box of Kleenex.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very enjoyable...funny and poignant,"My daughter and I laughed and cried as did most of the theater audience.  Even though Brad Pitt is being panned in the reviews, he was fun to watch.

Warms up well,"This film begins with big Hollywood (hollow wood) glamour, and perhaps more than a bit uncertain in its characters. But it warms up -- gradually but surely with each scene -- into a movie to fall in love with. One falls in love with the boundless freedom and power of these characters' lives. One falls in love with Claire Forlani, as always. And one falls in love with the performances of Hopkins and Pitt, as always.But what is it about, this film? We must recognize its devices. Forlani's character is engaged to marry the wrong man. Hopkins' character is very rich. Death enters their lives with a profound and sincere interest in Susan (Forlani).There's no reason to presume that Pitt's character, immortal Death, has never been in a human body before or has never been in love before. Perhaps the last time was three hundred or three thousand years ago. We only know it was not recent -- it's uncommon to him. We know (presumably) that if he has taken on the mortal coil before, it could not have been in the life he chose this time. We know that love is -- this time, or always -- new to him. What can we know about the existence of the character Death? We know that the immortal played by Mr Pitt covets the mortal embrace of life, of Susan Parrish.The film reminds us how life can be lived, and another loved, to make immortals jealous of our mortality.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Amazing! It's long but it's worth it!,"It´s truly fascinating!! I listened to all types of critics before seeing the movie. I just didn't know what to expect!. The truth is that's a great film. I was not a very big fan of Brad Pitt, but as an actor he is getting better and better. I'm really sorry that the Academy doesn't like him that much, but his part on the film is brilliant. Yes it is long!! but the story makes you be seated until the end. It gives you time to think about it and really enjoy the moment.

Good and Bad,"One thing that bothered me greatly was that this man, who professed that he wanted this ""passion"" for his beautiful, younger daughter, a passion that he had for her, and his deceased wife, he did NOT have for his older, dutiful and much less attractive daughter.  It's understood that his eyes did not light up for the more homely one when she walked in the room, as they do for the beautiful one.  The fact that Death is personified in the form of one of the world's most beautiful men (Pitt) also makes the idea of this ""passionate, honest love"" seem to be tied much too much to physical beauty. And, the fact that the ""man"" she finally falls for is not a man at all makes the picture equally uninspiring. And the level at which this love seems held, seems simply unrealistic.  As she walks off with the real Joe Black at the end, what is she going to do when he first shows signs of being a normal man?  So, how are we mere mortals to feel about ourselves after seeing this movie?",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
The longest three hours you will ever endure.,"It is totally beyond my comprehension that an experienced director could imagine that the subject matter of Meet Joe Black would justify a three hour running time. There are indeed some movies that can pull this off, such as the Lord of the Rings films, or Gladiator (which is two and a half hours), however these do it by employing strong plot elements, exciting action sequences and quality character development. They do not do it by sticking a bunch of big-name actors together on screen, with no clear idea of how their characters are supposed to behave, no  sense of purpose throughout the movie, and a script that consists largely of people staring at each other and saying nothing for a long time -- but this is exactly what Meet Joe Black attempts to get away with. The character development is virtually non-existent, with Joe Black (Brad Pitt) undergoing more personality changes than you can count; the plot itself is melodramatic to the point of farce (including an excruciatingly embarrassing scene where Brad Pitt puts on a poor Jamaican accent to talk to a dying old lady), and the music so tedious that you will be wanting to scream by the time the credits roll. Unfortunately it seems that Meet Joe Black is victim of the ""lovey-dovey"" film culture of Hollywood, whereby innocent lonely hearts can be duped into thinking a film is touching simply because it purports to contain romantic elements. Don't fall for it.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

When a picture's this good three hours fly by.,"This is one of the finest films I have ever seen.  The three hours flew by. What impressed me most was Brad Pitt's different characterizations of the young man we see in the drug store, a pleasant, exuberant young man, and Joe Black.  As the latter, he portrayed a naively caring person.  I never saw Death Takes A Holiday, but it would be difficult for me to conceive how it could have been as heart-warming a picture as Meet Joe Black.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Mesmerizing,"I absolutely love this film, it's one of my all time faves.Brilliant cast. Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani have chemistry that leaps off the screen, plus it helps that she is such a natural beaut and this was back when Brad looked a dreamboat and not homeless. All of their scenes together are mesmerizing and draw you under a spell. Add to that, Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt play off each other seamlessly and all the secondary characters play their roles perfectly.Beautiful score. Very clever writing; there are some truly beautiful and poignant lines which are delivered in a rhythmical cadence. Brad Pitt's scenes with the elderly Jamaican lady are my absolute favourite.Great story. I prefer romances alongside a good dramatic story, it's a shame they don't make these as much anymore. Drew is such an A-hole that you can't help but be on William's side immediately, but it would've been nice to see why Death considers him such an upstanding man- we only have his word to go on. Also, it doesn't quite make sense that Susan placidly accepts her father's opinion that Joe is not right for her, when she's just confessed to being wildly in love with him.Though there are a few holes in logic that do catch my attention (even though it's a fantasy, they are loose ends). One of the most glaring, is that Susan has a substantial interaction with Joe prior to his body being taken over; it's strange that she doesn't question his switch of personality and life experience, she would've been able to determine much about him already from just the initial encounter. Secondly, Joe is hit by two cars, shouldn't his body be messed up? So how can it be possessed? Thirdly, rather than be returned to his body in the end, shouldn't it just have been discarded, as death had already taken him?The only other slight negative, is that the party scene goes on too long- it does drag a little.All that being said, I've watched this film several times throughout my life and will continue to do so. It's utterly captivating and probably one of Brad Pitt's best performances.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"When You Meet Joe, Ask Him For My Three Hours Back","I don't know what I was expecting from this, I'd never seen it and knew nothing about it but wow...I'm going to echo what a lot of people said, no hot takes here. This is a three hour slog of meandering plot lines, overly pretentious fluff cinematography and very forced relationships.That said, the acting is solid given what everyone has to do and the concept is intriguing enough, even though the delivery fails. Oh, and it's wildly predictable, save for one surprise the entire movie plays out as you'd expect.Pretty disappointing for something that seemed desperately striving to be Oscar bait to end up being so tedious and underwhelming. Hopkins is good here, because he's Anthony Hopkins and that's what he does. Side from that this isn't really worth watching. That said, if you have a few hours to kill and need background noise then this is a good candidate. Watch the first twenty minutes of setup and after that this thing is basically on autopilot anyways.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance

An Underrated Gem That Has Aged Like Fine Wine,"""Meet Joe Black"" is a film that, upon its 1998 release, faced criticism for its length and pacing. However, with the passage of time, it has emerged as an underrated gem.The narrative centers on media mogul William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), who encounters Death personified (Brad Pitt), adopting the moniker Joe Black. In exchange for extended life, Parrish introduces Joe to the intricacies of human existence. This journey becomes increasingly complex as Joe develops feelings for Parrish's daughter, Susan (Claire Forlani).Brad Pitt's portrayal of Joe Black is notably detached, a choice that initially drew criticism. In hindsight, Pitt himself reflected on this role, stating it marked a period of lost direction in his career, admitting, ""I dogged it. I miffed it. I shouldn't have been there in the first place."" (LOOPER. COM) Yet, this very detachment enhances his performance; Joe's otherworldly demeanor underscores his role as an outsider, grappling with unfamiliar human emotions and experiences. This nuanced portrayal aligns seamlessly with the character's existential journey, making his interactions both poignant and thought-provoking.Anthony Hopkins delivers a masterful performance as William Parrish, embodying a man confronting his mortality with grace and introspection. Claire Forlani's Susan exudes vulnerability and strength, capturing the turmoil of a woman torn between the familiar and the enigmatic.The film's deliberate pacing allows for a deep exploration of its themes-love, death, and the human condition. While some may have found its nearly three-hour runtime excessive upon release, this extended format provides the audience with the space to reflect and connect with the characters' profound journeys.Visually, ""Meet Joe Black"" is a feast for the senses. The cinematography is elegant, capturing both the grandeur of Parrish's world and the intimate moments of personal revelation. The musical score complements the narrative beautifully, enhancing the emotional weight of each scene.If released today, ""Meet Joe Black"" would likely be celebrated for its introspective narrative and the depth of its character studies. It stands as a testament to the power of storytelling that challenges viewers to contemplate life's impermanence and the beauty found within its fleeting moments.In conclusion, ""Meet Joe Black"" has aged gracefully, offering a rich, contemplative experience that lingers long after the credits roll. It deserves recognition as a cinematic treasure, I'd give it a commendable 8/10 for its enduring impact and the profound questions it poses about life and love.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
A different take on life & love,"Meet Joe Black is certainly an original film and idea.  Death takes a vacation to see what life is all about, and he ends up falling in love.  Sir Anthony Hopkins gives a wonderful performance (as usual) as Bill Parish, the man that Death decides he wants as his guide on Earth, before he takes him. Brad Pitt is a pleasant surprise as Death/Joe Black.  A scene in which he tries peanut butter for the first time, he gives off the impression that he truly is having it for the first time.  The film's characters tend to say some overly-romantic things that make you wonder if the writers were trying too hard to make sure the audience can see the kind of ""head over heels"" love they are portraying.  Also, there are a few over dramatic moments in which the score is simply blasting overture in order to create a special dramatic moment, that just seems to be pushing it too hard.  At just about 3 hours, Meet Joe Black does feel a little long, but you don't seem to feel it until you reach the end.  All in all, the film lets you think about how much time you really have and whether or not you can live your life to the fullest in the time that you are here on Earth.  The question that you ask yourself at the end as you leave the theatre is, ""Has someone thanked me for loving them, and have I thanked someone for being loved?""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Guilty Pleasure,"British Reviewer.I have to confess for having a huge, huge blind-spot to the flaws MJB might have. It's hardly a ground-breaking setting: uber-rich media mogul comes to terms with his demise. But the way in which Brad Pitt's character forces our protagonist, Bill Parrish, excellently played by Anthony Hopkins really makes an enthralling tale about how, in the end, you have to let go.I acknowledge that this won't appeal to the types of folk who seek DEI in their cultural output but if you consider that this a film produced, in hindsight, what was a golden-age of modern cinema, it can carry you along. The cinematography is wonderful and the score by Thomas Newman is evocative and memorable.The way in which the director, Martin Brest has melded an intriguing love story with a supernatural element and, when you stop to think about it, shades of horror.

A Beautiful And Melodious 'Romance' Movie,"I remember that when this movie came out, a lot of people were disappointed with it. The chief problem I heard was that it was long. Well, it is long, running exactly three hours to the end of the credits. But I find that the length allowed me to achieve some 'distance' from the events that began the story, so that when the ending arrived, it wasn't so fresh - in other words we as viewers have been taken on a journey.And what a journey! We are treated to a warm and insightful examination of what it means to love. The love of a father for his daughters, and between the characters of Susan (the always-stunning Claire Forlani) and Joe (the equally gorgeous Brad Pitt), are the main focus of the story, but we are also treated to a very special moment as Jeffrey Tambor's character (a corporate ""loser"" with an ill-fitting suit and unfortunate facial hair) shares the joy of his relationship with his neurotic wife (the wonderful Marcia Gay Harden). There are also hints of fraternal, platonic love among Joe, his ersatz guide (Anthony Hopkins), and his son-in-law, Tambor.This is not an immature or simple love, either. The film deals tenderly with questions of responsibility and power, self-giving and fidelity. I am a huge fan of stories in which a person simply and confidently ""is who they are"" and forces others to react, think, and make decisions. There are several moments in this movie when Joe follows Lewis Carroll's great advice, ""When in doubt, don't just do something. Stand there."" There is an entire conversation with Susan in which he says nothing, but it is not one-sided, because she is forced to think about what she's saying. (Another example of a film where someone forces others to react and grow, simply by being himself, is ""Life As A House."")One of the problems with the initial release of this film may have been the theatrical trailer, which portrays a fun, humorous, and 'jaunty' Rom-Com with a slight metaphysical twist. People who went expecting to see that kind of movie would certainly be disappointed. The metaphysical content is more than slight (Joe is the personification of Death), and the movie never becomes fun or jaunty. What it is, is touching, intelligent, and utterly romantic in the best sense of the word.On the negative side, it is difficult to identify with the lifestyle of the characters (Hopkins is an unimaginably wealthy media mogul) and I found the sheer opulence and excessiveness of their surroundings to be distracting at times. However, it does make for great eye-candy on the screen, and the actors are more than able to bring their characters to life; none of them are dilettante, and Hopkins brings an elegance and self-awareness to the ""rich man"" stereotype.And speaking of stereotypes, the only antagonist in the film (Jake Weber as Hopkins' corporate right-hand and Susan's would-be love-interest) ends up a two-dimensional and utterly unsympathetic character who is incapable of the kind of love displayed by the people around him. It's a disappointing caricature in a movie filled with deeply explored archetypal characters. The filmmakers had an opportunity to demonstrate that all people have subtle, nuanced personalities, but there is none of that with Weber's role. On the other hand, Weber does a fine job with what he was given, and it is an interesting example of how an immature or self-interested person will attempt to sabotage the well-being of others rather than allow them to change and grow.This is an unusual movie that has not developed a cult following, which means it is probably destined to be overlooked by both the mainstream and the fringe movie fan, which is unfortunate. If it had been better marketed (the trailer is a criminal misrepresentation of the movie) it might have a higher profile today. At any rate, if you are a fan of careful, thoughtful, and emotionally mature storytelling, I fully recommend this movie to your perusal. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Beautiful and romantic,"Wow, what a surprise! I usually watch action movies such as Aramgeddon, Bad Boys, Strange Days, and Star Wars, so I had absolutely no interest in watching this film.

You can not miss this movie,"Meet Jo Black is a combination of comedy, romance and drama one of the best movies I have ever seen. This film last for three hours and it is a story of Death personified. In this movie you realize the value of life and appreciate the time you have on this planet since nobody knows how long it will last. The story starts with the scene where a couple Joe Black and Susan Parish meet in a cafeteria and find themselves in love; after this he leaves to go to work and while he is on his way he stops to think and wanting to go back to find out more about her he stops in the middle of the street and a car hits him causing his death. On the other hand Susan's father William Parish, a very important man who lives a very stressful life is experiencing a strong pain in his chest and feels like his time is very close to the end. He even starts hearing a voice, the voice of death. At the same time death is looking for a body to use in order to explore and discover how human life is. This body is Joe's body. Brad Pitt as Joe Black, is the perfect wonder, pure joy of the human elements; Antony Hopkins as William Parish brings his years of experience to this character and reflects the perfect business man whose life is out of control and his health is paying the price of his success, and Claire Forlani as Susan Parish the character who is in the middle and does not know what is really happening, she is just a victim of this game. The dialog of this movie is very interesting and sometimes it gets to be scary especially at the beginning of the movie when the death calls Bill to play his last card and then throughout the movie the way death's voice tells them what to do. This dialog puts the audience in a situation where everyone realizes how difficult would be to have a conversation with the death. I am sure nobody knows how to handle it. Lighting in the movie is fantastic with a lovely golden glow that goes by the hand with the soundtrack of Thomas Newman ""What a Wonderful World"" adding an extra depth to this movie. Music truly enhances the movie captivating and enhancing it. The mixture of the piano and orchestra builds up to an inspirational and emotional pull. The cinematography of the film was well thought out and extremely picturesque. This is the kind of movie that after you watch it you want to re-watch it more and more times. I absolutely recommend this movie not only for the message it leaves to the audience but also for the outstanding work done combining technology and technique to make the essence of the film come to life.

"A Film, not a Movie","So many of us enter theaters to be entertained. To laugh. To cry. To relax. We go to escape from the cares and responsibilities of life. Meet Joe Black is not what we expect. Filled with the best actors of the day, we expect the usual entertainment, but Meet Joe Black is anything but usual. We are forced to step into an unfamiliar arena. Things look the same, but we find ourselves forced to deal with the issue none of us wants to think about, let alone contemplate deeply, and certainly not something we expect to see on film. Meet Joe Black is among my top twelve favorites. It's slow pace is unfamiliar to Americans used to instant gratification, and though Brad Pitt's finely sculpted face is easy on the eyes, many viewers lack the patience to absorb the films content. I wish they would try. A few lines are insipid. The 'multiply times infinity' makes me gag, but the scene where Pitt tastes peanut-butter for the first time is positively brilliant, and should be studied by all actors hoping for a film career. The shifts from high drama to low comedy are subtle, and you don't notice many of them until you have watched the DVD version several times. What critics point to as flaws, I find to be some of the best parts of the film. Thomas Newman's music is masterful, each performance superb. What Martin Brest did was release his Director's Cut in theaters. Many viewers failed to spend the time needed to absorb and enjoy it. A pity.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Now, he is confronted with a dilemma: to listen to his heart (and love Suzan for the rest of his mortal life), or to listen to reason (and to become once again the angel of death).The end lives you a bitter-sweet taste in your mouth. One one hand you're happy that he didn't take her with him (she would have died), on the other hand you cannot help but feel sorry for him, because he has to live her, to go back and continue his lonely existence.Brad Pitt is great in the role of Death. He is, as Suzan says: ""shy in the most seductive way and yet powerful"" When we think at Death we don't picture it as a blond handsome guy with a stunning smile. A men who likes peanut butter more than anything and who has the candor of a child. And this contrast is what makes the movie great.Anthony Hopkins is, as always, at his best. A elegant gentleman who has the wisdom of his age. A father who love his daughters more than anything. Who dares to face Death when he realizes that He wants to take Suzan with Him.Claire Forlani (Suzan) is perfect for this role. She knows nothing about Joe and yet she falls for him. She accepts him without any questions. I'll never forget th moment when she realizes who he is. The look on her face when she accepts the inevitable: ""you're Joe!"" she says smiling through her tears.Ok, enough! As you can see I'm a sucker for this type of movies: a touch of mystery, a touch of love, a touch of supernatural and I'm hooked!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A pure unadulterated Masterpiece,"Underaprieciated in ever respect.When i first saw this movie i didn't like it that was when i was 9.the when i was 15 i saw it again and being a guy i don't cry at movies i just don't but this one had me very close. First of all to those who say this movie is crap? you are the kind of person Jake Weber(Drew) portrayed. The score was utterly beautiful.One of the most moving compositions ever made. The story line made the impossible seem very real while sweeping overtones of the beautiful piano piece swept you off you're feet into another world. The actors played there parts FLAWLESSLY not one stupid scene not one overdone expression. Perfect the critics got it wrong ,way wrong. worst remake,fools.Worst movie?

Orchestral emotion,"The critics never gave this a film a good start in life. Bring together Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt in the same film on one occassion, Legends of the Fall and the magic works, try the same again and you may think it can't work as well.  Meet Joe Black rises above it all, as it takes flight with the innocence of a wandering spirit, whose only task in eternity, is to take a life to the next place.  Moving into the bodily form of an unknowing participant (Brad Pitt) named only as Joe Black, he spends a holiday in the presence of a wealthy man of stature and decadence, William Parrish (Hopkins), delivering heart warming charm and wit, as he falls in love with Susan (Claire Forlani) the daughter of William Parrish. His main task, to take his host to the next place once his holiday has concluded.Experience this movie, don't simply watch it, from the charm of all the charcters to the heart pounding orchestrations at the end, when Joe knows his time is over.Believe me when I say, you will feel this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Three hours you will never get back,"This bloated, self-indulgent, three-hour sedative is what happens when a director gets lost in his own pretentiousness and forgets that movies are supposed to be watchable. It takes Death Takes a Holiday, strips out anything remotely engaging, and replaces it with an unbearable amount of slow-motion stares, whispery dialogue, and a plot that moves at the speed of continental drift.Brad Pitt? Not his fault, but damn. Death comes off less like a mysterious entity and more like a guy who got hit in the head before wandering onto set. His ""naïve curiosity"" makes him seem straight-up malfunctioning, and that peanut butter scene? Watching an immortal being treat Jif like a religious experience isn't the deep character moment they think it is.Anthony Hopkins does his best, but even he can't rescue this from collapsing under its own self-importance. Conversations drag on for eternity, stretching out basic exchanges like they're being paid per second of screen time. And the romance? Let's be real-this girl fell for a charming coffee shop guy, then kept the same feelings for his creepy, personality-free replacement, then flipped right back when he was gone. That's not love. That's an issue.And then there's that ending. Three damn hours for that? The sheer gall of making you sit through this glacial slog only to deliver one of the most underwhelming, nonsensical conclusions imaginable. The only thing that dies in Meet Joe Black is your will to live.This isn't a love story-it's an endurance test. If you ever consider watching it, just stare at a wall for three hours instead. It'll be more entertaining.3/10.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
A different romance,"I just got through watching this again. I didn't remember that What A Wonderful World/Over the Rainbow by Israel ""IZ"" Kamakawiwoʻole played at the end during the credits. What a beautiful way to end a beautiful movie. I would have made a few different decisions, the main one being a different leading lady. She is crazy attractive but not the greatest talent. Still, she was far from a mistake. Brag Pitt was awesome. I mean, GEEZ! I'm not gay but is this guy good looking or what. It was stupid. And his attitude was perfect for the role. Like the girl said in the movie, his indifferent attitude was sexy...or something like that. Hopkins was Hopkins. This dude couldn't turn in a bad performance if his family was held hostage and the captors demanded a bad performance for their safety. The ending was amazing. It captured the sorrow of love and goodbye perfectly. In closing, this whole movie reminded me of that first love, where you couldn't quite get a good breath and where every second was filled with thoughts of them. Still sad in the end but very romantic. I would think, the perfect date movie...although it is 3 hours. Maybe too long for a date. But try it anyway.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Phenomenal,"Wow.The movie revolves around Death (brad Pitt) coming to see what the world is like. Wanting to explore he takes the body of a young man and meets with, William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) making William show himself the world. The story develops and death falls in love with Williams daughter, Susan Parish (Claire Forlani) creating a troublesome decision for Death.This movie was fantastic. The story is carried so well by the acting demonstrated by Pitt and Forlani, was well as Hopkins. Each character is so well developed. And all around very fun.The theme is definitely Love. The story does a great job at replicating that theme, showing how love works, and how it effects everyone, even death. It shows really the premise of love and the different points of views and how it works. It in all is very well done.The film was well carried by great lines, beautiful shots, and strong emotions, in all it was so powerful.However, the one flaw was the movies soundtrack.

It's a remake...and I rarely like remakes. Could this be an exception?,"""Meet Joe Black"" is a remake of ""Death Takes a Holiday"", a wonderful 1930s film starring Frederic March as the Angel of Death. So, when I first heard about ""Meet Joe Black"", I was, at best, tepid about seeing the film. After all, I hate remakes unless there is something seriously wrong with the original. Fortunately, I ended up enjoying the movie...mostly because it was less a remake and more a reworking of the original material...and the new material is generally very good.Brad Pitt plays Death...though the film seems to avoid calling him this or any other common name for such a being. On day he's out collecting a soul when he meets a lovely girl...and he decides, at least for a while, to become mortal.Instead of just becoming human, he goes to one of his next intendeds...a very rich man named William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins). He reveals who he is to William and makes a bargain: he will allow William to live a bit longer IF he agrees to take him into his life and let him experience what it is to be human. What's next?The original was a MUCH shorter movie and very different in style. In this reworking, it's much slower and more deliberately paced. It also is techincally gorgeous--with perfect music, lots of great emotional scenes, and cinematography and some lovely acting. My only complaint, and it's a minor one, is the ending...but I don't want to say more as it might ruin your experience if you decide to see the film...which I strongly recommend you do. Near perfect, different and with an ending that isn't perfect (at least for me) but is still quite good.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Far too long and overly serious,"Death takes the body of a dead man (Brad Pitt) and calls himself Joe Black. He gets a rich older man (Anthony Hopkins) to teach him about life (for what reason I've forgotten). He also falls in love the man's beautiful daughter (Claire Forlani).I'm not gloating when I say I saw this up a theatre in 1998. The reviews were negative and the totally ridiculous 3 hour length gave me pause but I liked the cast and it SOUNDED interesting. What I got was an overly serious, slow-moving and frankly boring movie. There are a few (VERY few) good moments her and there but they're totally lost in this boring, sleep-inducing mess. The main problem is the length. This did not need to run three solid hours. I remember at the two hour mark quite a few people walked out of the theatre I saw it in. I can't blame them. I was thinking of joining them but decided to stick it out because I was mildly interested in how it would end. The problem is it had THREE different endings--all were bad and dull. It's a real shame because there's a really good two hour movie here screaming to get out. A pointless waste of celluloid.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Live a life such that even death will fall in love with it!,"What a masterpiece! Great acting, innovative original story, good looking cast and a first class direction. The story is kept simple but its so novel that keeps your intrigued till the end. Death is the ultimate truth and we all know it, uncertain about it and most of all many fear it.

""" Take it easy,  else, you'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation ""","In 1934, the late great Fredrick March completed a film called ' Death Takes a Holliday.' Splendid and innovative for it's day, it gave one pause on the briefness of life and it's singular, ultimate end. In 1998, a remake of the earlier Classic was made and called "" Meet Joe Black. "" Having seen 'Holiday' I was prepared for it's film resurrection. The gist of the story as written by Ron Osborn is that Death witnesses a sudden and tragic street accident which takes the life of a young man exiting a coffee shop. Assuming his body, Death visits William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) a successful tel-la-communication executive near his 65th birthday and strikes a deal. In exchange for Parrish educating him on the profound sensory delicacies of life, Death will allow him to live until his 65th birthday. The deal is set, until Death discovers he has fallen in love with Susan Perrish (Claire Forlani); William's younger daughter. Another obstacle for William is Drew (Jake Weber) an ambitious, devious and ruthless executive board member who is trying to undermined and destroy all he has built. Unwittingly William's close friend and confident Quince (Jeffrey Tambor) believes Drew and helps to remove and retire Mr. Parrish. The dark plot of this film fills three full hours, but if one follows the fluid direction of Martin Brest, it evolves into a sincere, sympathetic and romantic love story within an innocent, often humorous awakening for the Lord of the Underworld. Despite this being a re-make, it's final result will be seen as a superb recreation and both Hopkins and Pitt are experienced Thespians at their very best. Recommended. ****",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

This time Bill showing us the trips he took with Joe Black and how difficult it was for him to be taking lives and separating people. This times will be giving the viewers the feeling that Bill has come to contact with (the touch of death, smelling and discussing lives to take and why and when).

Compelling beautiful movie with delightful dialog to enchant you,"The first time I saw this movie was on its opening weekend in the US. I was taking my soon to be girlfriend (and later to be ex-girlfriend) to our first date. Naturally you can guess, being a guy I wasn't the one who picked this particular movie to watch. Yet after the first few scenes I was drawn in.The thoughtful, almost classic literature-like dialog all throughout this movie simply make it a masterpiece. The cast are the key in any such film, and everybody delivers here, especially Anthony Hopkins. The characters truly interact with each other, and you never feel like you've lost a step, you never think that the feelings portrayed are not credible.The story is endearing, it has a few funny dark comedy moments, but most of all it simply gives an overall good feeling to the viewer. I've read some negative comments regarding the length, all I can tell you is, until I read the comments I never even realized it is three hours long. I had to check the box of my DVD to confirm that it is indeed of the said length.I also can not finish this comment without giving some extra love for the performance of Jeffrey Tambor (as Quince). He nailed the role down to the last twitch of the thumb. The klutz loving husband who has always got the side of his wife and his family is absolutely the most lovable character of the movie, and everyone understands that he would even be one of ""death's favorites"". An absolute must see movie.PS: On a side note I would like to mention that this movie has to be watched in the original English speaking version.

Brad Pitt offers no depth, playing the role of death with all the emotion of a stick, and Hopkins snarls through yet another thankless role. Thomas Newman's overbearing score swells too many times during the film's three-hour running time, but the ending is easily foreseen after the laughable fate that awaits Pitt as a mortal early in the film.

Good movie,"Greetings from Lithuania.I liked ""Meet Joe Black"" (1998) when i first saw it back in 1999 - i was 15 at the time. Today i watched it for a second time - i'm 34 now, so its been almost 20 years - and i still liked it the way i did first time. ""Meet Joe Black"" is by any mean a great movie - it is not. Nor its a classic, but what it is a superbly looking 3 hours movie escapism. It has great premise, great story, very solid acting by my all time favorite Sir Anthony Hopkins and very good performance by always reliable Brad Pitt. Claire Forlani on the other hand did not create very memorable character in my opinion, although she looked absolutely stunning in this movie - you can't take your eyes of her. Production values of this movie were stunning - cinematography by a future 2 times Oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki, production design by a legendary Dante Ferretti - this movie looks absolutely stunning - no wonder it cost almost 100 mil. to create.Overall, ""Meet Joe Black"" isn't a great movie, because it has some issues with screenplay (no a great premise), some corny dialog and situations and some scenes that do drag. But other then that - here is fantasy / romance movie that is marvelous to look at. Good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

An epic love story!,"At the crux of it all, what Meet Joe Black is, is a love story, be it for Anthony Hopkins' character Bill's love for his late wife, his family, his life, his life's work or Joe Black and Susan's romance. What works is this beautiful story told from the perspective of the main characters, the kind of romance that makes you go ""weak in the knees"", as taken from the movie itself.Words would never suffice when talking about the talented Sir Anthony Hopkins. He has always been captivating in any role he has played, be it the doddering but lovable old man in ""The world's fastest Indian', his chilling portrayal as Hannibal and as the vengeful husband in 'Fracture'. Continuing his exemplary work, he essays a role here that takes him through different motions in a very short period of time, from a very successful professional caught up in his work, whose entire life changes as he is paid a visit by none other than 'Death' himself. Suffice it to say he was brilliant as ever!I have always liked Brad Pitt in the many roles he has essayed over the years. Now he is no Leo Di Caprio when it comes to acting (who I feel acts his heart out almost every time), but I have always felt Pitt does a reasonably good job of acting for the roles he has played. What he doesn't seem to bring with his acting chops, he more than makes up for it with his screen presence. And man, he does it in spades here!The revelation was Claire Forlani for me. I have only seen a few other titles she has been in and do not actually remember much of her other body of work. But I will carry this movie and Claire's performance forever in my heart! To sum it up in colloquial terminology, 'Find yourself someone that looks at you the way Susan looks at Joe Black'! :DNot a great lover of the romance genre, but I found myself deeply moved by the story and the performances, undeterred by the 3 hour run time, which did seem daunting at the beginning, but once the movie got going, I was hardly bothered by the length of the movie, captivated as I was by the story and the brilliant actors.A perfect 10 from me! :)",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

""Legends of the Fall"" indisputably on my all time top ten list notwithstanding, I would love to see these two really given the reigns to see where they want to go.The rest of the luxurious cast and sets are well worth watching in themselves.

In short, if you do not fall under the spell of this film, you are a hopeless cynic without a whit of heart!What's beautiful about Meet Joe Black? First of all, it's directed with such love and and an eye for detail that you can't take your eyes off it. The art direction, cinematography, musical score and staging are blended into an artistic triumph. The music by Thomas Newman is especially brilliant; haunting and sinuous.The cast is so good, it's hard to believe the movie was received so disparagingly by critics. Brad Pitt's impersonation of the devil inhabiting a young man's body is pitch perfect in every way. He gets everything right; a child like innocence of first experiences. Anthony Hopkins has never been better. Claire Forlani says more with facial expression than a thousand lines. Her love scenes with Pitt are unique. They're not only erotic, but deep and soulful in all the right ways. Marcia Gay Harden is perfect and Jeffrey Tambor as Quince gives a delectable portrait of a character we've all met and known from time to time.This is a ""feel good"" movie, so it was automatically dismissed by half the critics out there. It not only makes you feel good about life and death, but it makes you contemplate a lot of the important, simple issues of our existence.A classic in every way that will be loved by the lucky souls who really understand it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Brad is suppose to be Death, but he seems more like an idiot savant - a cross between the characters in movies such as ""Being There"", ""The Rainman"" and ""Charley"", etc. Maybe  the reason people in real life are able to cheat death frequently is because death is semi-retarded!

"A lovely remake of ""Death Takes A Holiday""","This movie is a remake of a classic '40's movie called ""Death Takes A Holiday"", and while remakes can be chancy, this one is sweet and fun to watch. My only quibble is that the movie is a bit long, but all the scenes are woven together so that the length of the movie (3 hours) pass by seamlessly. Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt, especially, are wonderful together and it is very interesting to see the youthful Pitt be in the 'power' position with the far-more-established, older (and always superb) Anthony Hopkins. Pitt's portrayal of Death incarnate is delightful as he attempts to navigate the world of the living; his often naive but utterly honest character is delightful to watch and Hopkins carries off his role of guide to Pitt with his typical panache and elegance. The supporting cast of Claire Forlani, Marcia Gay Harden, Jeffrey Tambor and Jake Weber are all superb and perfectly cast in their roles. I would be remiss without mentioning the musical score by Thomas Newman. It is gorgeous, sumptuous and stunning in places.In fact, the final scene (which I won't ruin here!) is made so much more poignant with the gorgeous music of the soundtrack adding to the emotion of the moment that the music is, as is often the case in movies, like another member of the cast. If you are a fan of any of these actors or just enjoy movies with a pleasant and/or slightly supernatural plot, this movie will not disappoint you. There is a touch of comedy, a lot of pathos and an offbeat love story all mixed into one, and if you can watch the last ten minutes of this movie without feeling moved to tears I would encourage you to check your pulse because, music included, it is a stunningly beautiful ending.

Best Brad Movie,"Both my daughter and I loved this movie. We've watched it over and over many times and will watch it again. We do not get tired of it. I've seen many of Brad Pitt's movies and I believe he puts himself totally into character.Brad's portrayal of death becoming human was like an innocent child learning for the first time. For instance tasting peanut butter and describing it, and listening to the characters interacting with each other and interpreting their reactions when discussing the party or business, then falling and feeling what love is like, and his questioning of everything. His character helps William Parrish, Hopkin's character, realize what is really important in life.I would not change the cast at all. The scenery, fireworks, and music were all fantastic. I really didn't notice how long the movie was. It puts you in sort of a dream state and I really didn't want it to end. I'm a dreamer, what can I say.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful but just too long,"It's great that Hollywood can make something like this, and it shows that only a film can convey this important message..TV just gets mawkish. but it really is too long, and too much stuff about the Hopkins' character's business...you could cut almost an hour off and it would be a better film without losing any of the message...I've just been told my comment is not long enough..it must have at least 10 lines of text...erm so yes I thought the younger daughter was very pretty and she had a nice luminescent back..and great cheekbones and lovely blue eyes...and this was probably the reason she was cast....................................................I think that's ten lines.....",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Thoroughly absorbing.,"This seems like a slow-moving film when you step back from it, but I honestly did not realize the passage of time as I became utterly involved with this absorbing film. Since that first viewing 4-5 years ago, no matter how many times I see it I'm always misty-eyed at the end, with a renewed sense of my own mortality, and a renewed appreciation of what I have in life. How many movies can one say that about? This is a very well done film, with outstanding performances by all.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Worst film ever,"After 20 years of moviegoing, I finally found it - the really really bad movie, the worst I ever have seen. The story was good for 45 minutes - not for three extremely boring hours which ironically made the theater collect an additional charge for over-length. And that was what I got: over-length. Much of over-length for a few Deutschmarks, in that sense it was a good deal.The story of Death coming to Earth as a person bears many possibilities - none of them was used. There are many long scenes with dialogues like ""who are you"" ""I'm Joe Black"" ""but who are you?"" taking five minutes' time. Sometimes even nothing was spoken, and the poor actors had to grimace endlessly to make it through the scenes. You see beautiful people in beautiful locations - but that does not make a movie! With 30 frames per second, you *are* allowed to move!I never leave a movie after half the time, but this time I almost did, if not for my friends with whom I watched this thing. Finally, we just thought ""F*** her, and let us go!"". And what the heck were the scenes with the black woman in the wheelchair speaking a strange language (in the German version, it sounded like Dutch) *without subtitles* ??? For ten minutes, I didn't understand a word, and nobody helped!This was bad. Worse than anything else. Even after bad movies I usually think, ok, I've seen it, I can talk about it. But this time I regret wasting 16 Deutschmarks and three hours.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Thorough Enjoyment,"I don't know what to say. I know I have seen this movie over 20 times, and I cannot watch it without an entire box of Kleenex, some good ice cream, and to curl up on my futon with a heavy blanket. This film is so amazing. The first time I watched it, I really didn't give it much patience, or attention, or thought. But after watching it a second time, I did a complete turnaround. It is my absolute all favorite movie with one of my idols, and I love it. What else can I say? It has everything a good movie should, with a little dose of extra emotions added in for comfort. If you want a really good cry, rent this movie. You won't regret it, I promise.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Most touching movie,"This is the most touching film I have even seen.  The topic of life, death and love is quite serious yet this film has quite a few humorous scene (anyone laugh at the IRS agent scene?)  The end is kind of sad but the tone of the whole movie is uplifting. The first time I finished this movie, I had no idea that 3 hours had passed. In my opinion, the length is needed to develop the complex plot and the character. I am especially impressed with Brad Pitt's performance. When he first appeared as death, he was quite stiff in his movement, expression, and conversation. In the end during William Parrish's confrontation with Drew, he was quite sophisticated and humorous.This movie is simply beautiful to watch. The cinematography is wonderful. The lighting, music, words, expression and body movement of the characters all fit together in harmony.I lost my husband a year and half ago to cancer. I find this movie rings so many truth in my heart. The message about love, being deliriously happy, waking up in the morning and say ""there is nothing I want more"", saying goodbye and taking nice pictures with you.  All these things I keep thinking about after I watched the movie, the happiness that I used to feel all come back in a flood...I loved this movie so much that I searched for reviews and comments on line. I was horrified at all the bad reviews from critics. I wonder how many people didn't watch this movie because of the bad reviews. I am sorry for the people who disliked the movies simply because of its length. I suppose if some people think a good lunch is hamburger and fries washed down with soda in half an hour, they might not enjoy a leisure sit-down lunch in a french restraunt with a glass of wine. I recommend this movie to a friend who didn't watch it in the theatre because of the bad reviews she read, she and her husband really liked it. If you like this movie, I hope you recommend it to your friends too.  If I had missed this movie, I would have felt it's a big loss.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Somehow it works,"On the surface, a three hour dialogue-driven drama/love story might seem absurdly long.  But ""Meet Joe Black"", in that undefinable way that some movies do, manages to deliver a satisfying experience.The story is actually quite simple:  Death himself comes calling for the latest mortal soul whose time on Earth is done, but instead decides to take a short vacation and familiarize himself with Earthly ways and human experiences.Anthony Hopkins, the soul in question, is a wealthy media mogul who strikes a deal with Death (Brad Pitt) and plays host to his curiousities about life. While showing him around and introducing him to family and friends, Death falls in love with Hopkin's daughter (Claire Forlani).The performances are solid all around.  Despite the criticism I've seen, Brad Pitt's subtle performance was intended and I thought right on the money.  I don't think Death would be quite normal walking around in something as unusual as life.Yes, the movie is long, but surprisingly it never drags.  It's just one of those three hour films that feels like an hour and a half.  There are countless scenes of well-written dialogue and excellent acting that keep the modest plot moving.I'm not surprised this movie generates mixed reviews, it seems like one of those ""love it or hate it"" things.  But somewhere in the middle of it all, there are some truths about life that shine through.  It's difficult to put your finger on all the impressions you will come away with after watching this movie, but it's certainly three hours well-spent.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Anthony Hopkins...,"Is the only reason I give it a 5. He gets me every time. Other than that, not even Brad Pitt's close-ups could compel me to up my rating from 1 star. Long, drawn-out, dull, full of pregnant pauses that made me want to run for the hills.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
One of the Worst Films OF All Time,"I had a bad feeling about this film, but never did i imagine a film this bad. Its too long, it drags on with endless boring scenes and it has a soppy pathetic eending that i could laugh at. Brad Pitt is terrible in it so is Clare Florani and even Anthony Hopkin's couldnt save this film. This film will put you to sleep and should be avoided at all costs!",,Anonymous,Romance
Love it or hate it,"I think this film is magnificent and very unfairly criticized.  It is fantasy at its best, is beautifully filmed, well written and well acted. Anthony Hopkins, in particular, is fantastic.  And above all, when it comes to love, ""lightning should strike"" and we shouldn't settle.Some people (OK, most people) say this film is too long, and that is their biggest problem with it.  I think that's one of the films more prevalent attributes, so that's where I'll start.  Either you're into a film or you're not.  If you're not into it, even a 90 minute film can seem like an eternity if there's no ""action"".  Camille, A.I., Me Myself and Irene and any James Bond movie fit that bill for me.  Therefore, this is one of those films where I won't argue with someone who doesn't like it.  It's impossible to like a film that can't sustain your interest.  Usually, unless it's just an obviously bad movie, the blame for this lies with the viewer.  However, I can concede that this film is not for all tastes and let the naysayers off the hook.I don't think the film is slow at all, I just think that Martin Brest took his time in allowing the story to unfold and the characters to develop.  Joe Black is very much a character study.  Most character studies only involve one person.  This one has two main characters and three or four more lesser characters who are all studied to one degree or another.  Cutting this film down to two hours would mean losing a lot of the insight we get into these characters.  No scene is rushed in this film.  All are allowed to develop at their own pace and continue on until they've said what they have to say. It's a marvel, and an tribute to the film that the studio allowed it to be released at this length.  The decision makers must have had similar thoughts, or they would have chopped an hour off it.  After all, the far inferior original, Death Takes A Holiday, was less than 90 minutes, I believe.The cinematography for this film is absolutely beautiful.  It's not real hard to believe that the movie had such a large budget when you stop to notice how magnificent the settings are.Thoughts on the cast...Anthony Hopkins lends dignity and credibility to every film he's in.  His character represents another moral of this film, I think, that we should do as much in this life as possible before it's gone. He, particularly, is the master of ""keep filming until I'm done talking"" in this film.  He's a careful man, and he chooses his words carefully.  He is not one to be rushed.  Neither is Death.  Brad Pitt certainly isn't the best thing about this film, but he doesn't hurt it any.  His take on the character is at least a fresh and interesting one.  And often funny.  Marcia Gay Harden is effective as the lesser loved daughter.  The first time I saw this film, I thought for sure Jeffrey Tambor would be a villain, as he always seems to be.  I was pleased to see him in a role as a weak, but essentially good man.  Claire Forlani is really what makes the wheels of this film turn, though.  After all, what is the premise of this film?  Death falls in love with a mortal woman.  How long has this guy been around?  How many women has he come across?  In other words, the girl better be pretty great.  One of the many weaknesses of Death Takes A Holiday is the girl that Death falls for, Evelyn Venable, is pretty weak.  I won't pretend Forlani is a modern day Katherine Hepburn, but she is incredibly beautiful and, in addition to portraying her character well, has a presence about her that Venable lacked.  She's believable as someone Death would fall for.  I guess. How the hell do I know?This film is a big throwback to the classic era.  I won't say it's Capraesque, since it digs a lot deeper into the characters than any of Frank's films, but the idealistic hero in an unrealistic situation is very reminiscent of Capra's films.Here's a thought that I can't really fit into any other paragraph, so I'll give it it's own.  Although the propensity of films to include an obligatory sex scene seems to have dwindled off in the last decade from it's ridiculous plateau in the 70's, I still tend to get annoyed by them in today's films. Come on, it's the 21st century.  We know they're having sex, we don't need to see it for five minutes.  Every director seems to think he'll be the one to make his sex scene better than the others, or show us something we haven't seen hundreds of times already.  Almost always, they are wrong and the sex scene is tedious.  This film's scene is an exception.  First, it is different because we're talking about Death here.  But besides that, Brest films the scene just like he films the rest of the film.  Beautifully and slowly.  Most importantly, he concentrates the camera on facial expression, not naked bodies.The ending is sappy and pours it on.  But I love it.  Go ahead and call me soft.  I love the fireworks.  I love the endless rendition of ""What a Wonderful World"".  And I love the happy ending.Typically, I think remakes and new takes of/on old films are inferior to the originals.  But this is the exception.  Meet Joe Black takes the far inferior Death Takes A Holiday much deeper.  Death Takes A Holiday portrays Death falling in love at first sight, and the whole film only lasts one night.  Fredric March is a great actor, but was extremely robotic in that role.  To do a story like this, the Death character needs to have a personality.  One of the many reasons this version is superior.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Far above the norm,"Most modern movies use tricks and conceits to grab and hold your attention. This movie, like its protagonist, fails to stoop to such manipulation, instead gently allowing you to bring out your best.  The message here is very simple - love, be courageous, accept your weaknesses and failures but don't let them hold you back.  The acting is so precise and compelling, that no tricks are necessary to carry you along into what should be an unbelievable premise.  Brad Pitt pulls off the daunting task of portraying a non-human discovering what being human is, from the first taste of peanut butter to the pain and rapture of love.  Anthony Hopkins is a mouthful of fine wine from a lead crystal glass - so odd to think this could be the same man who plays a cannibal elsewhere.

No, it is not a movie for video game and fantasy movie fanatics with their constant scene switching and chaotic action.Oohmygod. Anthomny Hpokins actually dances with his daughter for nearly a minute in a classic quiet ballroom dance without jumping around like a Mexican jumping bean.Heaven forbid. Anthony Hopkins and Bradd Pitt actually enjoy watching fireworks together from the terrace for 20 seconds.The intrique concerning Anthony Hopkins's business is, frankly, irritating because of its simplistic idiocy.

A must-see for people who like more from their movies,"Maybe it's the title that turns people off to this film, which is unfortunate, for this movie has the incomparable Anthony Hopkins,a luminous Claire Forlani, Brad Pitt showing some good acting chops, gorgeous production values and a glorious musical score. I was captivated by this film and its subject matter. I didn't care about its length. It was like curling up with a good book. Besides, I have become annoyed with all of the fast cutting of films these days with scenes of six seconds or so. Here, the camera lingers longer on these actors, who often take a minute or so to convey their thoughts/emotions--just like in real life. A good story will captivate viewers/readers. Death decides to ""vacation"" on earth and be guided by Anthony Hopkins' character, Bill Parrish, who is upright, smart, successful and wealthy. What better tour guide? And his fabulous NYC house with an indoor pool at the top: I want it! Death inadvertently finds that he digs Earth and its pleasures. Pitt conveys these nascent emotions very powerfully. Yes, there are some plot questions that one has at the end, but the overall story themes are the focus--don't go through life without having loved deeply.

This Movie is a Master Class on What it Means to Love.,"This movie is in my top five movies of all time. In the ""making of"" documentary you hear about how the director would sometimes take a scene 20 times to get it just right. It shows! Every single scene is like something from a museum--perfection personified. The script, direction, cinematography, music are all examples of how a movie can be a true work of art. I can find almost no fault with this movie. The acting is top notch, although I think Brad Pitt's acting here is not quite up to the quality of all the others.I just read a favorite review of another reviewer who loved this film and says that this is a movie about death. I respectively disagree. This is not at all a film about death, it is a film about love. I tell people, if you want to experience what love really is or really means, this is the movie for that--not in some romantic comedy kind of way--but a real philosophical experience and discussion of what it means to truly love. There are many characters experiencing their loving relationships in various ways and so many examples, discussions, and experiences of love, that to me this is a Master Class in what it means to love or be loved. The preoccupation about death is natural, since the main character is Death, wanting to experience human life, but in that experience, he thinks he falls in love, but he has no idea what that means. It takes the three hours of this movie (so well spent!) for him to be shown and taught what it really means to love. This movie is a classic. Of course it didn't do well at the box office. Works of great philosophical significance rarely do. I can only promise you, your life will be enriched after seeing this film and you will think about it long after--I sure did--after every viewing (about six so far).",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

wonderful performances,"I was reluctant to see this movie when it opened in my country since it got lousy reviews and because everyone I knew who'd seen it said it was boring. Some days ago I saw Anthony Hopkins in an interview where he said this was one of his favorite movies and I confess this awakened my curiosity.It was on cable tonight and thought I'd found out why he´d said that, being an actor I admire and found always excelling in whatever part he is to play.I did find the movie a bit too long and slow moving, but I also found that was not disgusting at all. I like situations and characters to develop and ¿why should that always be quickly done? I also found some of the moments when Joe Black is introduced to the family a little awkward. I believe director Brest does not always blend the comedy bits well with the romantic or dramatic streams of the story, maybe it's due to the pace, maybe it's due to some solemnity  imposed to Brad Pitt's performance.Anyhow, however corny the fireworks at the end it might have seemed to some viewers, the movie builds up to an overwhelming finale where life and death are marvelously brought together.Hopkins and Forlani are wonderful all through the movie and so is the rest of the cast. Brad Pitt looks somehow restrained at moments but ends up by convincing you(at least I was).Underrated as it is I think it deserves a high rank, much above other pretendedly masterpieces of our days.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

We have selfishness, greed, betrayal, loss and death. But we also have family, love, joy, hope and courage in the face of the ultimate foe. All these and more are portrayed with heartaching beauty.Sadly, some people just won't get it. They will see the perfect pacing as slow, the story as fanciful. They will bemoan the lack of ""action"", regale the realisticly restrained character portrayals as poor acting. That's a shame - for them. They will miss one of the finest cinematic experiences without ever knowing it.

Beware brainiacs!,"Yes, that means YOU! Here's a little tip to start you off on the right foot with this movie: before viewing it, make sure you're calm, relaxed and have a good couple of hours to enjoy and think about what it means to you. If you're not sure about it, please do yourself a favor and try to find a better time spot to watch this incredible picture, because otherwise you won't be able to appreciate it to its fullest extent, an obvious and truly regrettable mistake for most of the viewers.If I could have my own way, concerning the review, I would happily write at least 5 page essay on this film, because anything else is just smoke up the ass, --as someone very close to Joe (B. Pitt) might elegantly put it ;-) --, but this is hardly the place to do it.Now that we've gotten that out of the way, I'd like to say a few words with regard to the nature of ""Joe Black"": it is the kind of viewing experience that you have,..no--you MUST enjoy with your heart, your emotions, don't let your everyday logic take hold of you and tell you what is and what is NOT possible because you will never understand what the ""deal"" is and will definetly miss the whole point by a million miles.It's basicly a story about an impossible love between a beautiful and charismatic woman and an entity, embodied as a young man, which exists completly above the human condition even though it is inherently tied to its destiny. The journey and reunion of these 2 worlds can only be made through love, TRUE and pure in every way possible. Because it begins from such a mythical standpoint, evoked by genious artists of the past in numerous ballads and poems, the story can allow itself to blur out the crossing line between what we see as REAL and possible and the realm of fantasy, myth and philosophy. The comedic moments are of no real shortage either, except they do not abund but are skilfully enhanced by the delightfuly extraordinary performances of Sir Anthony Hopkins (solid as ever), Brad Pitt (the man never ceases to amaze me) and an outstanding Claire Forlani.Stereotypical patterns of movie analysis that critics and movie-going, popcorn-tossing brainiacs have used for years and years simply do not apply here, because this one actually requires an open mind and a morally and intelectually educated person to fully comprehend. And no, damnit, I'm not that kind of person, I've just barely touched the tip of the iceberg here! Social statures, wealth and the location of the events in ""Joe Black"" are irrelevant, -- not inexistent -- and the reason for that is this is not a socio-political drama, but a huge metaphore of LOVE, please, PLEASE get that straight into your minds!Even after watching it in perfect conditions, you haven't understood anything and feel as if you're looking down an empty, dark barrel with only your echo to keep you interested, then God damnit, it's NOT for you... and I don't give a rat's ass, because it was never supposed to be for everybody!PS: if you are one of those persons that likes to whine about the movie being too long and you're so lazy you didn't even take the time to check out how long the movie lasted BEFORE you bought the tickets/rented it, you should stay indoors and stick to your soaps, seriously!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

A good film if you approach it with the right attitude,"I really liked this picture, which is interesting, because I tend to agree with a number of the negative comments I've read on this board. Many have complained that the movie is redundant and too long (three hours!).Whether, the movie is too long is, of course, a matter of perspective. I enjoy three-hour baseball games. Why not a three-hour movie? The question is whether one feels that the three hours were well spent--and that depends on what one expects out of those three hours.If one is looking for a tight movie where characters set their course based on one conversation or one event, then skip this one. If you are open to characters that are somewhat more complex and need to hear the same thing in more than one way to get the message, then you just might enjoy this film.Also, if you're looking for a love story balanced by an action film (Titanic, Pearl Harbor), then, again, you will be disappointed. I think studio marketing departments have figured out that guys like action films and women like love stories, so they try to blend the two in order to maximize box office. This film pretty much ignored that.This film deals with a number of relationships among a number of people and their relationship with ""death"". I won't list them all, but at the conclusion of the film, I felt as if I knew these people. I liked many of them, and I felt they had depth to them.

They have great chemistry as well as Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt. Interestingly, Sir Anthony Hopkins is autistic. He found out he had Asberger's in 2014 which I believe makes him an even better actor. The film is a bit long, being 3 hours long but I feel every scene contributes purposefully to the movie. Highly recommend this beautiful movie, even if you're not into the romance genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Don't Let the Runtime Push You Away,"What a surprise. I had low expectations when I started Meet Joe Black. Perhaps it was because of the 3-hour runtime, but I was expecting a convoluted and boring mess of a film. The exact opposite was true for me. I was continually transfixed by the story and glued to the screen for the full duration. The concept of having Death learn about the subtle wonders of life was beautiful and compelling.The script was well-written, though slightly melodramatic at times. The performances were excellent, and I finally saw the brilliance of Anthony Hopkins. He brought a quiet confidence and sense of acceptance to the role. His relationship with the other characters, especially Susan, had an emotional pull that brought me in. On top of it all, this score is one of my favorites in recent memory. Other than a few quirky moments in the first act, the music was a powerful reminder of the depth of the story.One of my favorite elements of this film was the use of silence. The runtime allowed the audience to experience stillness usually brushed past in the average film. Nothing felt rushed, everything was calculated, and you leave remembering that nothing is as certain as death and taxes.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Death affirms life - A Gorgeous, moving film.","The concept of the grim reaper taking human form on Earth presents many potential dark moments. Rather than focus on such things, director Martin Brest and screenwriters Kevin Wade and Bo Goldman (""Scent of a Woman"") chose to focus on the life-affirming aspects of the concept.And what a ride it is - three hours of some truly touching scenes. Imagine a nether-worldly presence that looks at the world through detached eyes, not knowing what or why humans feel. Death breathes down everyone's neck and people concern themselves with trivial worldly matters.This film has a wonderful spiritual theme. Enjoy your life. Wake up knowing that you need nothing more - that when it's time to leave for the next world, that's ALL that needs to be done. No regrets. There are not many films that give people a sense of calm about leaving this life. I think ""The Sixth Sense"" is the last one that did that for me.See this one with someone you love. Laugh with them, cry with them and hold their hand tight through all three hours. When the credits roll, look at each other and smile. No regrets.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not very flattering.,This movie had a good premise but the slow pace and terrible score were almost unbearable.  This was a showcase for Brad Pitt fans as he got to just stand there in most scenes with a minimum of dialog. He acted as if he were playing the part of a robot.

A Miracle about Death And Love,"It is one of my favorite movies, a brilliant look Death certainly takes your breath away, and that's not the only factor why i love this movie. It is well planned and carried out, with subtle changes of the characters, like the young man in the coffee shop and death, then the young man back when Death 's gone. I have to say I am so shocked when seeing the low rating of this wonderful movie, and even some users complained it's too long. But to me it's perfectly fitting every detailed the movie intended to tell us. It brings me thoughts, ""lighting might strike"", I respect other users' opinions, yeah we welcome the diversity in minds, but what I'm trying to say is that it is indeed a great movie in all times, and it's beautifully made and wisely presented by Brad, Anthony and others. I love the ending too, it's not like somebody else says as "" Hollywood ending"", I can't see why they put it that way. And I voted it 10/10. I love the love scenes in it, so pure ad sacred.

Joe Who?,"I honestly can't believe some of the reviews posted here. This film was one of the most placid, sterile, coldest cinematic texts I've ever seen. For a film like this you should create a heart first and build everything else around it. Instead Mr. Breast believes that by placing star credentials and production values above all else we the audience will be gullible enough to lovingly swallow his shallow love story. Not only that, we'll pay him 10 bucks for the privilege of doing so.I'm not gonna bore anyone with the plot because there isn't one. It's just a pure waste of time. Seriously, in three hours you can manage to convey some quite profound feelings (Godfather, Shortcuts, Schindler's List) but Meet Joe Black didn't make me feel anything. It hoped to latch on to the same elements that made Titanic a smash hit (love story, length, evil fiancées, floppy hair) but least that had decent special effects to salvage its hollow characterisations. Even the car accident that provides Joe with a ticket to `our' world looks crap. Brad Pitt wasted his talents in this week affair, as did Hopkins. Both of them look as if they are quite unsure of why they are here in the first place. As for the characters that comprise of Hopkins family, well what I was just hoping for was that Joe would have a sudden change of heart and decide to kill em all for being so darn ungrateful. I really can't hack listening to rich white people complain about how horrid life is because they can't find `true love'. I don't think that you need a three-hour time frame in order to accomplish that. These are the very same things that annoyed me about Notting Hill, yet that film at least didn't take its self as seriously as this drivel.As for all this talk about Claire Forlani, well yes she is one amazing looking bird but she sure can't sustain a leading female role by herself. All she did is look like a sulky rich girl drifting from room to room, suffering from major existential teenage angst. She was about as animate as my Granny's antique wardrobe. It's a case of great face but zero charisma.You know what, this might have turned out into quite memorable film if ... In the end you have enough time to think about the emptiness of it all and feel like cursing yourself for having gone to see it in the first place.It's not just that it's such a pointless film that annoys me. Rather more it is the actuality that it cost $90 million to subsidise this wet, soppy, nonsensical mess. If you have a great desire to see what a personification of Death may look like, I wouldn't waste my time watching this filth you may as well wait for the real thing! At least I bet it'll be more interesting this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Meet with boredom...,"Remake of a movie launched in 1934 and whose name was ""Death takes a holiday"", ""Meet Joe Black"" must be very inferior to the original movie although I didn't see it. This is the typical movie with a good idea but badly exploited. Here, death is epitomized by a good-looking young man (Brad Pitt) and he'd like to know why men dread so much death. He's settling down in the life of a well-off man (Anthony Hopkins) and his daughter falls in love with Pitt.""Meet Joe Black"" is a movie whose result isn't convincing at all. The screenplay is very repetitive with annoying cues (Pitt who often asks for peanut butter) and contains a few weaknesses like Pitt's weird car crash at the beginning of the movie. Besides, this is probably one of Pitt's weakest performances to date. He leans too much on his physical appearance and I find him too inexpressive.It's also a movie that is terribly long-winded and it drags on. A flat and listless film-making doesn't help matters. It focuses too much on the actors' faces as if it wanted to define their feelings.At last, this is an overlong movie and in three hours you find time to be bored because nearly nothing's happening. A dull and tiresome movie where you only remember Claire Forlani's shiny beauty",,Anonymous,Romance
A Surprisingly Good Drama,"Not being a Brad Pitt fan I didn't see this movie on the big screen.  I don't think this movie suffered because of it.  It didn't have grand special effects, but it did have a great script and well-acted characters (I can't believe Anthony Hopkins didn't get a nomination) and an interesting, albeit remade, plot.  I was very surprised to find that I liked this movie as much as I did--I had been expecting a boring drama in which I watched Pitt cry.

To Clear things up,"People have wondered why the original character came back at the end. In my opinion, he was allowed to come back because Joe Black was in love with Susan, and because he wanted to see her happy. He would do anything to have her be happy, because he realized what love means, to be able to let someone go to be happy. Remember, he is death and could choose who he wants to take and when. So, he allowed the original character to come back to make sure that Susan would always be happy. And Joe Black probably figured that Susan originally fell in love with the first character. And also, I do think the original character would have some knowledge of what happened when he was ""dead.""",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

"An inspired movie about life, cynics stay home--a must see for everyone else.","I have never commented on a movie before, but I can't get this movie out of my mind and heart.  It is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is a movie for those who believe in life, with all of its ups and downs. I am not a teen-age idol of Brad Pitt, and expect acting ability in an actor in spite of his incredible good looks.  In this movie I found both.  .. Brad Pitt's dual portrayal of the guy in the coffee shop and death/Joe Black is testament to the depth of his acting ability.  Contrary to the critics' opinions, I thought his portrayal of the character ""death"" was deeply emotional and powerful.  There was a quiet calmness, a depth of character and even a certain peacefulness in this character which I found consistent with the eternity of death, in contrast to the boyish charm of the guy in the coffee shop.  It almost made it seem possible that this character could exist.  Anthony Hopkins portrayal of a man who is facing death in a matter of days or hours is realistic without being morbid, and was nothing less than spectacular.  In fact, his performance makes the viewer believe that it really is possible to have no regrets if one can live a life with meaning and integrity.  Truly ""a man like you, Bill"" would have no reason to be afraid.  I have seen this film 5 times now, and each time I have found it more entrancing. If this film were one minute shorter, it would lose much of its power.  It is in the silent looks exchanged between the characters, the pauses in the dialogue and the timelessness of many of the lines which give the movie its ""haunting"" quality.  It is easy to see why the critics didn't like it--it is not a cheap Hollywood story.  The movie makes you think and demands that you take a look at your own life and your relationships with those around you.  It is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

It would have been easy to play these characters as clichés, cynics, or totally clueless. That didn't happen here. The characters are flawed, earnest, confused, and very true. Whether rolling in the depths of selfishness or attempting to find a life path for themselves, they all prove very real and fascinating, particularly as you have the opportunity to see humanity through Joe's eyes. The Joe character was another surprise. Who would have thought an immortal could be so human? Curious, quick, and self-involved to a fault. Wonderful!

I have this vision,"of Benjy Stone and company sitting around and writing this screenplay, but there is no King Kaiser to tell them it smells, so each of them gets to put in their little story, with the result that when the film seems like it is about to end, it still has 45 minutes to go. Benjy, the lover of Alan Swan movies, insists it needs the big business intrigue, which could have been dispensed with a lot easier, and with two or three less characters to clutter the landscape. Cy wants to punch it up with a sex scene, and has the idea to shoot it so that with a few added cameras, it can qualify for late nights on Cinemax as a half-hour feature. Silent Herb has the right idea: why can't Death just come for this big wig and leave it at that.

Inspirational movie about the beauty of accepting dying and death when you still have some time,"The fairy-tail rich soon to be 65 years old businessman Bill Parrish (played by Sir Anthony Hopkins) does not need a lot of time to understand that his life will not last much longer when he encounters angel of death occupying human body of a gorgeous handsome young man (Brad Pitt). The beginning of the story was a little bit reminding me of the Seventh Seal of Ingmar Bergman and Antonius Block playing the chess with the death in it. However, Parrish quickly realizes, that his remaining time can be better used to accept his destiny, get his things in the order and say goodbye to everyone with expression of love instead of useless bargaining. And such an attitude is more important not only for us older folks, but for everyone, because it brings tremendous freedom to act, enjoy, love, and finally leave this world in the style. Even if you are younger, you can learn a lot from this wonderful movie. We all are dying alone, but help in the transition from our physical planet is important, especially when it is coming from non-physical reality, other side, heaven, etc. Choose what you like, believe, on for some of you what is based on personal experiences from travels beyond the physical body. Of course, there is no proofing of that here and never might happen, but what if there are higher spiritual beings, like angels, entering human bodies to help us in our transitions as in this movie? For sure we will encounter a lot of helpers after we depart, if we continue and it is fully up to us what we choose and ask for.

"Prefer to, at a Much Later Time!","""This is crazy,"" says Anthony Hopkins's character Bill Parrish, a billionaire media mogul to titular character Joe Black, at a fairly early stage of this extraordinarily long remake of the clever, 1934 relatively short film, Death Takes a Holiday. He already knew something many viewers probably didn't. They were in for a very extended, lengthy, muddled ride watching a hugely tedious, undramatic and unromantic film, whereby Death (Joe Black - Brad Pitt) drops into the Land of the Free, to be tutored in ways human, by Bill Parrish and later, his lovely daughter Susan.Producer/director Martin Brest had a relatively brief ride amongst the Hollywood elites. He made 2 very good action comedies, Beverly Hills Cop and Midnight Run and an OK drama, in Scent of a Woman, all consecutively. From there, starting from this film it was all downhill, ending terminally with the catastrophic Gigli. He hasn't really been heard from since. All the signs pointing to a decline are on show here in this ponderous, pretentious affair.For a start considering it was made in 1998 for a then, pretty staggering $90 million, it's one of those productions where you just can't see where the money has gone. It does have some opulent sets and locations in a Rhode Island mansion, but so do other films with much smaller budgets. Salaries? Reshoots? I don't know, but unsurprisingly it was a troubled shoot.It has 2 extremely bankable stars in Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt. Hopkins is as serviceable as ever and undoubtedly would entertain reading a telephone directory. Pitt is not miscast, but I feel hopelessly misdirected. He is asked to play Death as this naive, virginal, neophyte, when the opposite, most certainly could have applied. The eternal Grim Reaper should have been seen as being the epitome of intelligence, charm and attractive menace, especially after his early library introduction with Parrish, when he is invisible. This results in a couple of hours of ""awkward"" between Pitt and co-star Claire Forlani (who really tries her hardest) as Susan, instead of rebirthing the sexy chemistry, we'd been led to believe had been established by the earlier cafe scenes. And speaking of ""awkward"", how about that absurd road accident? Junkies, drunks, fugitives from the law maybe, but sane individuals don't stand in the middle of a busy road, completely love-struck and wait patiently to be run over.There are sub-plots; which have all the repetition and dramatic heft of your regular daytime TV soaps. I'd like a dollar for every time we saw Pitt and Hopkins standing/sitting bemusedly in a board room meeting in Meet Joe Black. And Marcia Gay Harden's character of Allison, Susan's sister, is (for a 3 hour film), ironically underwritten and generally ill-used.Laughably Martin Brest apparently took offence at some of the airlines and TV stations who tried to do him a favour and did their own 2 hour edits of the movie. Seems he was incapable of picking up the message that there may have been a few decent ideas in Meet Joe Black that should have been delivered in a more simple and lean package.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely Fantastic !,"I originally watched this touching film when it was released in the cinema - and was thoroughly impressed by it.

Most movie's lately lack that certain Hollywood magic, that feeling of grandeur. With the exception of Pleasantville, this is the only movie I saw last year that possessed that quality. It does not rely on special effects, or cliches, it simply asks you to follow this story, and it's characters, and I did. I felt that it was Oscar material in every way, and I regret the criticism it's been forced to take. As for the three hour running time, I say only this, it could not have been shorter, every moment was required to convey each detail. Since seeing it, I have gone back and watched other movies by Martin Brest, and this one was truly the most impressive.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
What a Wonderful Movie!,"Please, set aside an afternoon with someone that you love, and enjoy this movie together. I cannot find words enough to express how much I love this movie.  Once you have seen it, take a step back, and really think about what you have just seen.  Think about how sometimes you have so much love for someone, but that you stillsometimes have to let them go.  Yes, it will hurt, but you never know what will come along to appease that hurt.

"Meet Joe Black...........A ""whisper of a thrill"",","Yes, these are the only word combination which can describe this film - ""A Whisper of a Thrill"". great movie with superb direction, excellent music( thanks to Mr. Thomas Newman, he is at his best with the score),wonderful cast and very very especially, the performance. No doubt, the combination of Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins proved again(after 'The Legend of the Fall')the best of the best combination in Hollywood.This movie is all about emotions - Love,Life and Sacrifice - but these emotions has been presented so deeply in this film that I found the new meaning of these words. This is kind of movie which will definitely move your world of emotion and your life as it did to me.But one thing I need to say is that this a kind of extraordinary especial film which is definitely not for everyone but only for especial one who can feel the message of this masterpiece.Watch this film with your love ones and I bet you will thank me later.""William Parrish: Its hard to let go, isn't it?

i love it,"I think that Meet Joe Black, was casted excellently. The coffee shop scene makes my heart flutter. I love Bill (played by Anthony Hopkins) he is such a distinguished man. His love for his daughters runs deep and he takes known info about his upcoming journey with great stride. Joe (Brad Pitt) he is just so great, he's child like inquisitiveness is so adorable. He may be Death, though it may be dark, he learns to show compassion and he learns to be human. The two seem to become quick friendly. The whole movie is just beautiful, the music, the scenes, the homes, the party, the clothing. It is all so wonderful. Did I mention the Music. ****",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Yeah, I love this movie","10 out of 10 for me too, Mr. Sponseller. Some trivia first. Two of my favorite movies star both Pitt and Hopkins. The other one being ""After the Fall"" of course. And I just noticed the other night that ""Twelve Monkeys"", for which Brad Pitt won a Golden Globe, also contains Louie Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"". ""Meet Joe Black"" is on satellite a lot, and I watch it most of those times. I bought the sound tract CD, for Thomas Newman's beautiful music. Susan and Joe are staring at each other to Newman's music right now, and Pitt does this so well. Claire Forlani, also. The two scenes with the old Haitian lady were just so damn good, too. I wonder whether that was one scene, and seeing it, Brest thought: ""We have to have more of this"". Bravo to Martin Brest, who directed some other great films. Great cast here. Jeffrey Tambor is perfect as ""Quince"", a complex character. No, he's not a pedophile; just a sentimental guy who knows he married well. The look that Marcia Gay Hardin's Alison gives him at the dinner table is priceless. Wrapping this up, the handsome, talented kid from Missouri continues to do fine work.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"really liked the movie,it's among my personal top 10.","It might sound strange having Death as one of the main characters of the movie, but what this movie really made me think of is actually ... life. How happy are we at the end of each day with the things we've done throughout the past 24 hours? With the way we've interacted with the people we crossed our path with that day? It seems to me that Mr. Parrish was an example at that, and that's what Death came to find out - what was the secret behind that. Of course - the answer is simple - LOVE. So, go out there - find your true love and be prepared to set an example worth following in the way you live your life!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
For those who appreciate beauty over technicality,"Meet Joe Black is a great film. It's way up there in my all time favourites. Never have I seen a film deal with death and love in such a beautiful tender way. The running time allows the film to move at a steady pace, not rushing itself for the sake of those with short concentration spans. Infact the running length is indicative of the entire film for me.It seeks not to conform but to draw you in. It gives you space and time to watch the characters develop, to show depths and aspects (especially with Pitt) that help you appreciate what is happening. Hopkins is on form here - he leaps on Parrish with passion and takes the dialogue to a level far beyond it's worth on paper. Pitt is also convincing and Forlani is superb.Much work has gone into this film and I believe it shows. It moves me to tears each time I watch it. It's not perfect - the pay-off towards the end as Pitt reveals himself is disappointing and could have been better executed - but this is secondary to what the film is really dealing with. The core issues of a man coming to terms with a life about to end, the wonder of whether Forlani really did grasp what was happening and more captivated me.Please do ignore those who whine about having to sit more then two hours to watch a film. This is simply a wonderful film and well worth your time to watch. Just have a box of tissues ready.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A fine take on the classic movie ""Death takes a Holiday""","This version of ""Death takes a Holiday"" was excellent, The brat ""Brad Pitt"" plays ""Joe Black"" who is actually the death angel who took over the recently killed boy that Susan Parrish (Claire Forlani) met at a Café house briefly and found compelling enough to possibly fall in love with, but they both leave the café and Brad Pitts character dies immediately via two cars hitting him, which Susan Parrish doesn't know. The rest is quite fascinating as ""Death"" (Joe Black) using the boy from the Cafe's body comes to take Sarah Parrish's Dad home to heaven (William Parrish, Anthony Hopkins) and the unique change in personality that the Café boy takes on while Sarah Parrish thinks he's attempting to stalk her. Nothing questionable, but one erotic sexual scene is portrayed, but nothing shown. This movie does play on the fallacy that by being a good person more so than a bad person gets one into heaven, and all evil people go to hell. Which is the only thing wrong with this script. (No one gets into heaven by being good, only through Jesus, John 14:6 and anyone who believes in Jesus no matter how wicked can get forgiveness in Jesus and go to heaven, being just good won't cut it.) A fun fantasy story otherwise and quite well acted especially by Anthony Hopkins. A really nice ""feel good"" movie, that is all.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Great performance by Pitt and Hopkins, good score, stimulating","Both Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt give excellent performances.  It's a wonder neither of them was nominated for an Academy Award.  Claire Forlani also does a good job, but is far overshadowed by Pitt and Hopkins.The plot is mostly believable.  It is entertaining to see Death (Pitt) react to input from his five human senses and adjust to them.  These inputs bring him very close to being fully human, thus confusing his job of ""taking people"" when their time comes to die.  The camera angles change as Death becomes more ""human.""I especially appreciated the movie's comments on what life and love are. They are definitely NOT trite, and leave the viewer with plenty of food for thought.  I'm not much of a fan of love stories, but this one grabbed my interest, largely due to the characters involved.  A love affair with Death is not everyday fare!Lastly, the score is also excellent.  It complemented screen action well.This movie is highly recommended, especially for those who enjoy intellectual stimulation and philosophical debate.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
The person reading this could do a better job,"The cinematography and soundtrack were above average -- the movie looked and sounded fine.However, anyone reading this humble review could write a better script.Boy meets girl.  Both are very engaging.  The possibility of a straight story being told and the potential entertainment that might have been makes MEET JOE BLACK all the more horrible.GHOST used the afterlife myth plot in an interesting and fun way.  JOE BLACK did not and fell flat.No wonder Anthony Hopkins (incorrectly) claimed that he never wanted to act in another movie again after he saw the final cut of JOE BLACK.  No wonder that in promoting this movie, Brad Pitt did the talk show circuit and stuck to praising his fellow actors.Last, chocolate is the number ONE most craved food on earth -- the food of the gods, the food of passion, etc -- NOT peanut butter.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Two superb male leads,"Anthony Hopkins, in my opinion, is one of the greatest actors of all time. He has a beautiful modulated speaking voice. Brad Pitt is also a really good actor so picture them together in a film. 'Because I could not stop for Death he kindly stopped for me' comes to mind. Beautifully paced drama filled with emotion and mood, great music, lovely characters makes this an unforgettable movie. If I saw it many years ago I had forgotten it. It stirs the emotions and takes you far away into your memories of love and life. This film is about a good man who leads a good life and brings out the best in other people with one exception. The three hours can be broken up now as it is on Netflix in 2020 when we have more time than we know what to do with being isolated and fearful. Most of all, I loved the presence of Anthony Hopkins about this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

An Intellectual Movie for the Introspective Person,"This movie, if one allows, challenges the life one lives and how one chooses to live it. It is artfully poetic, reminding me certainly of how difficult we make our lives. LIVE life and enjoy the small and big things and take NOTHING for granted. It is not a movie for one looking for pure entertainment. This movie is for those who enjoy a well-written script and direction. As a writer/poet I could think of no other movie that moves me so very much.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Death Takes a Holiday,"I know it's not a polite topic to discuss in public. However it's a topic that can't be overlooked and best discussed rather than spending so much in therapy. From the moment of life there's death. It awaits all things in life whether or not at the moment we believe it. So, how do we deal with it? Sometimes in self denial, sometimes in self abuse, sooner or later we all have to face it. This fallacy of positive thinking, always believing somehow we too can escape that grasp of death.Now if you read this far, in that quest for knowledge. A seeking mind for the wisdom of truth. You will find in this journey it's all in our perspective, a matter of faith, belief in our own attitude. Ask any medical provider who strives to prevent it, ask any soldier who has to face it, clear down to the undertaker who must daily prepare it. Then talk to those that almost bought it! That Grim Reaper is there always when we least expect it. So, we tend to deal with it in movies, plays, poetry and song. An art form mirroring life as if it was just mere amusing entertainment.We can put a spin on it in cd's like in the songs of Dido's ""No Angel"". Where we can feel the chords of melancholy of love long lost. We can find beauty in it in movies like ""American Beauty"", a journey of one man's mid life crisis and unfortunate life ending. Or, on the other hand, we can find that death can indeed take a holiday in a movie like ""Meet Joe Black"".Most of these artistic expressions are epitomes of character assassination. However, in ""Meet Joe Black"" the twist is now, it becomes a matter of choice. Answering your own questions, dispelling your own doubts, overcoming fear and desire and our most basic emotions. Imagine a dialogue with Death, talking heart to heart with the Grim Reaper and at the same time teaching it all about life. This is a classic movie, excellent script of dialogue, love, compassion, innocence, honor and legacy with a splash of spin and clever twist. Centered around the simplest things in life, like peanut butter! The themes of inescapable reality, like death and taxes, feelings like hard to let go and cherishing those snapshots that in the end you take with you. It's great fodder to ponder, do we really converse with death in those final days and... would you?So if you feel that you can cry every fifteen minutes in passion and compassion. If you feel you can watch a contemptuous dance with death for over three hours. If you feel it's a topic that merits just cause and deep contemplation to just bury the dead. Or if your just looking for good tear jerk emotions. Listen to ""No Angel"", take a deep look at ""American Beauty"". Turn up the volume of your DVD player to catch the whispers and ponder. Then ""Meet Joe Black""!",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Not for Folks with ADD!,"I love this movie, but if you can't stand waiting for characters to thoughtfully and deliberately deliver dialog throughout a 3 hour film, you may want to skip this one.Even aside from the concept of the movie, I was thoroughly captivated by the dialog and its pace. Perhaps it spoke to me of simpler times gone by and helped me reminisce of when people actually cared about what came out of their mouths and used actual conversation as the primary source of entertainment instead of television and the Internet.Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time.

If only death really looked like THAT.,Is it possible that Brad Pitt could be even more beautiful? I sympathise for those other reviewers who thought it was just too lengthy.

They took a simple yet profound premise and slowly milked it for all it's worth. The acting is sublime, the cinematography gorgeous (saving their best work for the most intense scenes). The movie flows so well, it's often as if the actors are reacting emotionally in the only way they possibly could under the circumstances.This is no movie to rush through, it's not for the impatient.

A fantasy about the reality of relationships and  passion for life.,"Meet Joe Black is a fantasy that reflects the reality and the passion of relationships. This movie took the time to clearly define each relationship. I felt each character's ego was explored through great acting ability. I enjoyed every aspect of Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Bill Parrish and found it refreshing to watch a movie that celebrated a highly successful man whose character could not be compromised. A man who maintained love for his family, life work, and life itself with passion and dignity. I felt Brad Pitt's interpretation of death was delightful from the humorous to the darker sides. I enjoyed seeing death evolve through life's experiences. This movie made me laugh and cry and every time I watch it, I appreciate it more.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A life affirming movie that will leave you awestruck,"At the beginning of the movie, you will feel somewhat vulnerable for disappointment since you would think that this is your average romance movie. But the moment Brad Pitt struts into the film, you'll be fascinated by his charmingly witty attitude, which is enough for you to realize that this movie is unique.I will not be providing a synopsis since I believe that each detail should be abruptly indulged in this particular movie especially to that it is directed by the underrated, yet brilliant, Martin Brest.The most astounding part of this movie has to be the acting. Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are breathtaking for they were at the highlight of their acting career. Every scene is exhaustive yet has a hint vagueness to keep the audience in a mood of suspense. The delivery from the whole cast leaves you in ecstasy and hungry for more.Alas, I voted a notch shorter than brimming due to the ending that simply fell short from that lofty built up the movie offers, yet uplifting enough for you to reach there.

Mesmerizing eyes,I watched this movie for the first time several months ago and could not miss one second of it. Joe through out the movie has such a wonderment and exciting learner about him. The scenes with Joe and Susan were so intense that it could have been a silent movie with their mesmerizing eyes seducing each other. Anytime they were together they were like magnets so drawn to each other.Anthony Hopkins was excellent in this movie as was the rest of the cast. Each and every character was portrayed to the fullest extent of all of the actors.The scene where Joe is at the hospital is magnificent..even the accent from the islands. The movie continues to build and there are no lulls......I have watched this movie it over and over again even to the point of knowing the dialog! I LOVE IT!!,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
one of the most underappreciated movies i have ever seen,"It is apparently highly fashionable to bomb on this film. I would simply like to state that if you intend to watch meet joe black with the preconceived notion that it is a ""3 hour long, boring and sappy love story"", then by all means i suggest not seeing it because you obviously won't like it. Most of this movie's bad reviews are part of the mentality that most have that if a movie comes out of hollywood, it is supposed to appeal to all of the masses.I found meet joe black an excellent reminder of our mortality as humans, and also a great example of character development. The story moved along as if it were a merchant/ivory film in a few ways in my opinion, and if you don't like those films i suggest passing this one over for something more stimulating like varsity blues or i know what you did last summer.Although a bit long, i sat through the film and felt that none of the scenes in particular was a ""throw away"" except maybe the fascination with peanutbutter, which added a quirky little edge to the already dead-serious (no pun intended) joe black. If you are a person that is capable of sitting down and watching a 3 hour movie full of dialog and nothing more, then by all means i highly recommend this film, for i found it to be one of only a few love stories that is capable of pulling out an emotional reaction of the viewer on many different levels, including a fairly true representation of love, fear of mortality and the universal (if not by subconscience) ideal that as humans we simply do not want to die, but leave our mark on society or history before we go. This is a movie that takes all of these things that we believe that make us ""human"" and presents them to a cold person that knows not of human nature, and sometimes has quite a clear and true perception of life that is unclouded by emotions.However if you are expecting anything along the lines of Titanic (a much inferior film), than i suggest passing this up. This is not the movie to watch with a closed mind, or simply by someone that cant appreciate similar movies of the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Waaaaay tooo looong and (ouch) painful.,"For the first time in my life, I walked out of a theater seriously considering whether I should write to the producer, director, distributor, whomever, to see if they would give me my money back. Multiple times I had considered walking out in the middle, but instead waited to see if there was some payoff in watching it through to the end. There wasn't. And those are hours of my life I will never get back!!! I thought this film contained some very poor acting (with the exception perhaps of Anthony Hopkins -- but even then, it was probably not his best considering the acting quality of those he was working with). Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani were irritating throughout. And, I really didn't understand why this movie had to be so long. Some serious editing might have helped, but even then, I'm not sure if that could have overcome the acting.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Absolutely awe-inspiring.,"This flick has one of the best casts I have seen for this type of drama. They act exquisitely well together, and it shows in the emotion brought forth in each and every scene. I love the way the characters pause between lines, as if they are truly living in the moment.Anthony Hopkins uses his traditional crescendo and decrescendo in the conversations, and it makes every scene he is in wonderful to watch. Claire Forlani is absolutely breathtaking, as usual. She displays her emotions in this movie with such elegance. She appears to be a very strong woman, using her intellect even in the characters she plays. Her relationship with her father, Anthony Hopkins, is something every little girl dreams of. The couple played by Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor display what appears like true affection for each other. They complement each other perfectly. If you love to hate someone in films, then ""Drew,"" played by Jake Weber is your man in this one. He is despicable.In all, I have seen this movie a total of 20 times, or more. I lost count. However, I never grow tired of watching it. It is spellbinding and although I am NOT an emotional person by any means, I cry during this movie every time I watch it. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to see a truly great movie with a great performance from all actors involved.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
A True Classic!,"This is one of my all-time favorites. A true Motion PictureMasterpiece! Sure it didn't do well, and most everyone seems to not care for it too much, but my explanation to this is that it just wasn't the time for it. What I mean by that is that if this movie would have been released back in the 50's, it would have been a smash!It is very deep and deals with lots of emotions and interactions of people. This Movie has a heart, and every time I watch it I get inspired.It is a true masterpiece in writing, directing, cinematography, and acting. A remake of the 1938 Motion Picture, Death takes a Holiday, the script is outstanding. I give Martin Breast full stars for undertaking the challenge of this script, and he definitely succeeded. Emanuel Lubezki delivers amazing images (I love the images of the coffee shop). The Acting is incredible.

Please give it a chance just for the music!,"Amidst all the clamor about ""star's"" personal lives, I must say, Brad Pitt is the very handsome (wish he could have been like) Robert Redford type person in this film (as he was in The River Runs Through It) that makes us girls drool. The music is worth a full box of Kleenex, alone. It is beautiful to look at. Anthony Hopkins continues to amaze. The relationship with the heart melting Bayou woman is heavenly. The ""twist the tables on the creep"" part is grand. Plus, you will never look at peanut butter the same way again. I remember when the film came out, all the buzz was that it was a disaster and that it was too long. Another problem with it was the, ""why do they feel the need to remake such a wonderful film?"", problem. What gets me, in my old age, is that nobody ever stops to remember and realize that ***BROADWAY*** is always reviving the best of the plays and musical comedies with all new casts and sometimes variations on a theme and people don't stir up such a ruckus. In fact, now they have a ""Tony"" category for them. I had better get the DVD. I always watch this when I see it's on. I guess owning the soundtrack is not enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

I have two negative things to say about it though. I did not like how Anthony Hopkins character had a favorite daughter. I thought that was weird and out of character. I also am not so sure about the ending. I liked it. But I'm not sure it's what the movie called for. Maybe too foofey? I dunno¿

A slow psychological tidal wave of art,"This movie affected me on a very deep level. I agree with one of the other comments that in order to appreciate its message, you need to watch it several times with long breaks in between. For me, it was about the fluidity, fragility and powerlessness of life against the concept of death. It asks the unanswerable : who or what is directing our individual fate. It also implicitly discusses the superficial qualities of life : the different masks we all like to wear to impress. Death seems to come, only to wear a mask and study other masks, forcing the characters to see behind each other. In the end, death is forced to take off his own mask and suffer the experience of loss. It becomes more moving the more times you watch it. It is a slow-moving, psychological tidal wave of quality art. However, for those who don't wish to have their thoughts provoked about the mystery of life and death, it may be tiresome and a bit boring.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Outstanding Cinema * Recommend Highly * Brad Pitt is Superb *,"This film is an outstanding example of well casted, well acted cinema - It touches the familiar feelings deep inside of all of us and has such clarity to how we deal with personal issues both positive and tragic - How we all make an effort to understand the long and winding road before us in this life and in any additional manner of life following -also important to note, Brad Pitt being an Understudy in many was to the great Robert Redford - of course Redford having Brad Pitt play the very unique role in ""A River Runs Through It "" what many of you probably overlook -is that Robert Redford played a similar short role in a classic Rod Serling brief early in his career around 1962 - about an injured policeman who comes to an old woman's cabin - and he (Redford) is Mr. Death -So it is very ironic that Brad Pitt should have this great chance at a similar role in Meet Joe Black - being the handsome young man coming to Hopkins as Death, just as similar was Reford, even more handsome when he was younger, coming to the old woman's house as Death -Meet Joe Black should have been recognized far more by the academy - it is a must to see - and can be viewed quite often while still enjoying it, this is a 10 on scale of 1 - 10 and will hold up as the years go on - most certainly -See this film - you will really enjoy it - If you like quality films - You really have to love this artistic piece -Heres to world peace: Ponch *",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

(and if so what happens?), when will this nice young man show his ""darker"" side and carry out his mission? and so on...The actors and actresses couldn't have been selected more appropriate for this film. Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt both deliver superb performances - probably because their characters fit them so well. Every time Claire Forlani enters the set my heart starts pounding and I'm completely paralyzed until the scene's over...WOW what a character, in my opinion unmatched in both beauty and personality!

I typically dismissed such claims, but with a movie like this, I have to wonder. Seriously, 10 out of 10 stars? Casablanca material here? Citizen Kane?I agree with some of the readers here that the first part of the movie has energy and engaging dialog and I kept thinking, what happened as the movie progressed? Hmm, let's see the problems I have with it.Claire Forlani--It took me a while to figure out what it is about her that bothers me...it's as if she is trying to prevent her lower eyelids from coming up and closing her eyes. Like she is constantly battling it. Then at other times, she just closes her eyes while she talks. Is she on Demerol? Watch her next time and you will not be able to stop thinking about it.Brad Pitt--First, his character at the beginning is interesting. As Death, he is not. I could care less if he wants to experience being human. I don't exactly feel compassion for him. He falls in love, then he is a smart azz to Hopkins when Hopkins objects to him using his daughter as a test lab for his feelings.Anthony Hopkins--His performance was, as typical, very good. It's as if the movie starts MOVING again when he comes on screen. However, I have problems with his character. Why, when he got upset at Death fooling around with his daughter, and objected about it, and Death basically said ""Too bad"", did he say, ""What are you going to do, kill me?"" Everyone was waiting for him to say that. Also, as to show the screenwriters dearth of ideas, they don't give us anything interesting to chew on. If you were Hopkins, wouldn't you be asking ""Where do we go when you take me""? What's it like? Where did you come from? What can you really see? His character doesn't ask these questions because the screenwriters aren't creative enough to come up with anything.Length--Lots have been said about the films length. Perhaps some people can become more engrossed than others. But man does this film go on. There are whole scenes that don't need to be there, then they ramble. The last scene even drags on and on...walk over the damn bridge already!What's good about the film:1) Central idea 2) Supporting actors like Tambor 3) Cinematography and overall ""look"" 4) Anthony HopkinsSo, overall a fair package. I can enjoy a moving, romantic or sentimental film. But long passages of nothing happening, with piano music draped over it, does not make the scenes for me automatically moving, or profound, or even interesting.One of the other writers I read wrote that he left the theater a number of times and came back. This is one of those few films that you can do that with, because very little actually does happen during the course of the film.10 stars? Geez.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
writing that brings up some huge questions of cosmic proportion and expresses them in soft spoken phrasings that resonate with the human soul.,"I was surfing channels today and came across ""Meet Joe Black"". I have seen this film several times over the years. I enjoy watching it every time. The power contained in this quiet understated story is unbelievable. I am amazing and inspired every time I watch it by the dialog; the depth of the conversations that define this story. Your writing brings up some huge questions of cosmic proportion and expresses them in soft spoken phrasings that resonate with the human soul. It is almost like you were given some extraordinary power from supernatural forces to bring this story to the world. It is a truly astounding movie and one that everyone should see. it challenges the watcher to ask themselves deep questions about who they are, where they are going, and if they have done enough to connect with those in their life. Thank you so much to Bo Goldman, Kevin Wade, Ron Osborn, and Jeff Reno for writing such an amazingly powerful script.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Beautifully Done.  Excellent story, acting, direction and music.","Despite this being an older movie, I saw it for the first time tonight and was delighted with it. All the actors were marvelous with the lone exception of Claire Forlani who was OK but I got rather tired of the ""shy - I want to look at you but I'm afraid to"" thing in every scene with Brad Pitt. The music was excellent but too loud in many scenes and drowned out some of the dialogue. Especially loved the scenes with Pitt and the dying old Jamaican island lady. I didn't understand every word but the accents were marvelous. Pitt is more than just a pretty face. Hopkins turns in his usual excellent performance. I don't know how he does it. Jake Webber is a terrific villain as the oily, stab in the back character. Marcia Gay Harden is totally believable in her role. She doesn't overdo it. Just right. Jeffrey Tambor is equally believable as a slightly ""in over his head"" son-in-law who gets pushed around but finally stands up and does the right thing, regardless.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Has my father shown you his collection of rare books?""","Oh, what a masterpiece.  For all those unsatisfied souls who thought they'd never live to see the day when Brad Pitt did a Jamaican accent, I give you: ""Meet Joe Black"". For all those desperate men and women who wanted to see a movie in which Brad Pitt spends ninety per cent of his screen time looking blank and, frankly, a little stupid, I give you: ""Meet Joe Black"". Some viewers, however, may feel a certain something is missing.  What could it be?  What is the elusive quality that this film lacks?  Oh yes, it's all coming back to me (I drifted off for a second there, mesmerised by the thought of the production meeting in which the Brad-raps-with-black-lady scene was first suggested) - the one thing this film needs is a plot.  And at least an hour of its running time cutting out.  And an entirely different cast.  And something happening, at some point.  Another imdb reviewer has asked what us precious souls could have been doing with our precious time instead of watching this.  Well, I could have been asleep.  I could have been having my toenails removed by masked intruders.  I could have been starring in a porn movie.  All sorts of things!  In fact, next time ""MJB"" (as I like to call it) is next on TV, I would happily be doing anything except witnessing it. Saints preserve us, in a more enlightened time than this, the people responsible for ""MeetJoeB"" (as I like to call it) would have been burned at the stake. There can be no excuse, no explanation, for pap of this quality and quantity.  The only possible response for any sane individual who accidentally endures the monstrosity known as ""MJBlack"" (as I like to call it) is to systematically seek out all those involved and have them destroyed.  Yes, that would mean ""Fight Club"" would never have existed.  You know what?  I can live with that.  If I could turn back time (as Cher once so memorably said) I would do the job myself.  Happily.  No court in the land could convict me, once exhibit A had been, uhmmm, exhibited.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you: ""Meet Joe Black"".  And you can keep it.",,Anonymous,Romance
Everyone should have an angel like that !,"Haunting, relentless and unforgettable -- three terms that would certainly describe Death.  Then, add Brad Pitt in a green suit with necktie askew and voila!  After Hopkins' near seizure, there are a few moments early on during which one doesn't quite know where this film's going (e.g. how can Death be so dumb?!), but the comics do work and the story launches.  Once it does, it grabs your attention for the remainder of the film; you don't want it to end but you know it has to -- Death didn't stop over for nothing, after all. Add West Indian accents to Mr Pitt's repertoire and a sensuousness that remains beyond compare (as a couple Pitt & Forlani have got definite repeat-appeal).  Hopkins is great, as usual, and must never rest for the quantity of excellent films in which he's partaken over the past year. Would that we all go out on such a high note, with full understanding and our eyes wide-open. Superbly done -- go and see it! (Rating 4.5 stars of 5.)",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Torturous and unending!,"You'd think that between Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt (not to mention the inimitable Jeffrey Tambor), an at-least-decent movie would emerge, but that was regrettably not the case here. That is not to say that Hopkins and Pitt turned in bad performances; they were both what you'd expect of them: Hopkins at turns stiff and explosive, Pitt utterly chameleonic. Rather, it is the ineptitude of the writers (all FOUR of them!) and the director that fails this movie so miserably...and what is there to a movie after that? So much of this film reminded me of Peter Sellers' 'Being There,' but that movie worked with a fluid story, single-minded direction and all spot-on performances. This...well, the story is single-minded, the direction is sloppy and the performances are (at best) spotty. Even the usually excellent Pitt's character is all over the place: one moment he's naive or petulant as a 5-year-old, the next he's as omnipotent and stern as a god! Again, not his fault clearly. His performance at every turn is solid, but the turns he's given are just too much. Behind all this is a score that sounds like it's been lifted from 3 or 4 other movies. It sweeps, dips and soars often completely counter to the action on the screen. Nowhere is this more evident than in the last conversation between Hopkins and Pitt. My wife and I were convinced at any moment they were going to be pressing their faces together in a climactic kiss! But, no, it was just a chat...that went on forever. My pregnant missus was laughing so hard, she felt certain it was going to induce labour! The writers of this movie should've stuck to TV scripts. It's clearly what they do best. Too much of this story was too trite, and too much of the dialogue sounded like it was pieced together from greeting cards. The best example of this is Hopkins early speech to Forlani on the plane, regarding looking for true love. That monologue jumps from one cliché to the next, as though the writers stood in a drugstore on Valentine's Day, rifling through a rack of niceties and copying down the insides. I gave it a 4 out of the IMDb 10, and that mainly because it wasn't '""Manos"": The Hands of Fate,' and did have a pretty solid core cast. But do yourself a favour: avoid this movie. I watched it with my wife (though at my own suggestion, I'm ashamed to say), and it's truly surprising we both made it through all three hours of this dreck. Don't do the same. Go watch any of the number of other better movies either Hopkins or Pitt have done...then just put the quality together in your mind. You'll be a better person for it. I only wish we'd done the same.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
There are no words,"There are no words to describe this movie, maybe because in fact there are so many that best fit it that it would be a crime to just use a few.  It is excellent, not only because it's plot is so unique but because it takes human emotions to a deeper level.  I personally enjoy the whole 'life's meaning' theme and the actual thought of having death take a vacation from it's dreaded routine to finding romance in an unexpected twist of fate. Both Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins's performance are brilliant, as they both go hand in hand in a secret of their own to their up-coming journey to that Next Place. When I watch this movie I seem to be confronted with a bundle of questions that unravel themselves as the movie continues-where do we go after we pass away?  what is the meaning of life? why are we here?  And I personally enjoy the dialogue between Joe and the Jamaican lady in the hospital as she explains child-like Joe that life is not all fun and games, and that he should take those colorful pictures that he was able to take through out his journey, before he takes unpleasant ones.  I fully recommend this film, and hope that you might find it as unique and touching as I did.",,Anonymous,Romance
Box office disappointment  doesn't= bad movie,"This was a very interesting film from Martin Brest. It was a very moving film with a great beginning and one of the most spectacular endings to a film I have seen in a long time.  Anthony Hopkins gives one hell of a performance as a loving father, protecting his daughter.  Brad Pitt gives a great performance as death.  This was not a disappointment by any means, it was a surprise, a pleasant suprise.  This movie should have made over 100 million. A great romantic movie!",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Superb movie on all accounts!,I was captured by the roles played by the leading three actors.  They were absolutely awesome.  I experienced every emotion that they did as they played their scenes.

"A good movie, though not fantastic","I thought that Brad gave a good performance, a lot of the film depended on his non-verbal communication of Joe Black's personality/innocence. Anthony Hopkins was good as well.  I didn't like Claire Forlani or her character at all.The movie is very long (3 hrs!) and a few plot parts are definitely drawn out.  It felt as though it were about to end 3 or 4 times before it actually did.  But overall, I wasn't bored or distracted, and it was fairly thought provoking.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Fabulous Movie---Claire Forlani is brilliant,"as an actor myself, if you watch the opening scene between Pitt and Forlani ( and at the end ) a couple of times, u can see the the brilliant work of two great actors. The opening scene is a wonderful scene that actors might want to try in class, Forlani oozes with vulnerability and sexuality and Pitt who plays kind of a naive but sincere kid looking for work in the big city really shows his talent and why he is an accomplished actor today. The movie is kinda of cheesy but it reminds me of all the bad reviews ""The Natural"" got with Robert Redford in 1985 and that movie now is considered the best baseball movie ever....don't know about Joe Black in 20 years but the love story hit home and my heart.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

...death takes another holiday...,"Enjoyable but long movie with a competent cast led by Hopkins & Pitt. Despite the retelling I found the chemistry between Forlani & Brad Pitt did work. I was also impressed by a marked improvement in his acting abilities. Theres hope for the man yet. Without giving too much away this premise of the spectre of death coming to earth in human form and mixing with us mortals is an intriguing one. What if he liked the place, found a nice woman or man and decided not to return home. The thought of living an over extended life is not an unpleasant one but the question arises of the millions of sick & suffering who would welcome a quick relief to their discomfort and pain. Oh well just a thought that niggled at me afterwards. The supporting cast here give very commendable performances. Marcia Harden as the 2nd favourite daughter and Jeffery Tambor as her effusive,bumbling yet loving husband. I rated this film 7/10. A great romantic tale but a tad too long.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

How long does a dream last?,"Martin Brest has delivered a spacious movie, in which he rightly allows plenty of time for his actors to register very complex emotions, which they do most admirably. The moment when Claire Forlani realizes just who Joe Black really is is moving and memorable. Brad Pitt beautifully conveys the difference between the two characters who inhabit his body; and Anthony Hopkins delivers a tour de force from beginning to end. I know it's a hard thing to do in these frenetic times, but try letting go of reality and day-to-day mundanity when you watch this and other movies. Go with the characters; let the director take you on a journey. When the whole story is a fantasy, don't nit-pick about ""inconsistencies."" So the situation is preposterous; sometimes preposterous things happen to people and they discover new ways to respond to those experiences. A dream is as real to our brain as waking reality.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
It's Just So Boring.,"When I first saw this movie, it was so bad that I couldn't even finish watching it. The movie was dull and boring. Brad Pitt, didn't help either. He really is quite a bad actor.

Strikes the Right Emotional Chords for me. Mortals have their own virtues,"No regrets....
It's a good feeling isn't it?Well I fear this will be eventually be added to my list of guilty pleasure movies. In my opinion any particular cinema that makes me feel, think, relate and lingers with me even after it has ended has succeeded in doing it's job.From a PoV of a budding cinephile who has seen many exquisite works of brilliance, this one does not check the boxes in many aspects. This is stretchy, it takes it's own time to weave the narrative, few plot points are lazily handled and of course logic & reasoning takes a back seat sometimes.But.... from the PoV of an admirer of art and basic humane sentiments & feelings it does check a lot of boxes.A particular scene of this movie along with another has been made viral a lot and honestly that is one of the reason why I had wishlisted this one a long time back. Post some research I found how this one had quite a few nominations in the Worst category and it is a whopping 3 hours long which threw me bit off track. But finally I made time to watch it today.And oh boy, I have no regrets whatsoever. I thoroughly liked the movie, almost whole of the 180 odd minutes. It had it's subtleties and I feel it never really forces the audience to feel sad and sympathetic about it's characters, but it still unknowingly managed to leave me teary eyed by the end. It explores human emotions, love and sacrifice in a way that feels real and relatable.On the logical part, I can't help but think aloud that this movie is always a fantasy and the events can never happen in reality, so there is no point in deeming it unrealistic; and also the behaviour of Death to be illogical. Maybe there are some things/feelings exclusive to the mortal beings that even eludes an immortal timeless entity like ""Death"".And there is nothing much to say about Anthony Hopkins performance. He slays as always.This one really strikes the right chord for me and I will definitely be visiting this again.-It's hard to let go, isn't it?-Yes.-That's life.

Avoid avoid avoid,"You'd think that with a couple of big names like Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins this film would be watchable at least.

A completely ridiculous plot, an awful 'performance' from Brad (and most of the rest of the cast too) and three hours of the most tedious drivel imaginable, which gives you plenty of time to wonder how this film got past the ideas phase.

A romantic movie that touches the soul.,"Meet Joe Black is a movie that touches the romantic soul in everyone.  From the very beginning through the bittersweet ending we are transported along with Susan Parrish(Clair Forlani) as she meets and falls in love with the surprisingly charming Joe Black(Brad Pitt).  Clair Forlani pulls this character off with an unbelievable amount of charm and beauty, while Brad Pitt leaves us wondering what will happen next.  Not to leave out Anthony Hopkins(William Parrish), his character is the glue that grounds this movie into every day reality and possibility.  Although the movie is close to 3 hours, the incredible chemistry between the actors will have you paying attention to the romance instead of looking at your watch.

I enjoyed all the performances. Especially Hopkins, Pitt and Forlani. I rather liked Brad Pitt's totally innocent approach to everything. The love scene was especially nice, aided by the music. Instead of being the usual groping romp, this scene briefly touched upon the sanctity of sex with someone you love and how special it is.

Let the feelings fairly rule the world!,"The Best: Among all the movie is hard to pin point a better part, as the movies better part is its whole! The Worst: The runtime of the movie may have been boring to some people, not to me, anyway. Rating: 8 /10One nice morning multi-millionaire Bill Parrish wakes up in his New York's surroundings manor aware of the voices he said he heard during the last night. Bill Parrish holds in his hands the possible future of his company Parrish Communications with his follower Drew possible fiancé to his daughter Susan. Susan, fresh woman at an hospital, routinely heads to the coffee shop where she usually has her breakfast, and there she meets the man who can possibly change her life forever, as for Bill, his head his in a weird place right now, not only he's nervous about the deal as for the upcoming 65 anniversary party. The voice Bill heard that night constantly hits him and speaks with him coldly and scarily, until one night at dinner the voice says it is on the door of his house waiting for some one to get him in. when he orders the maid to let the person in and join him to dinner, Susan gets in instantly gets in and gets in shock realizing the mystery man is the young man at the coffee shop.This is the square one to a movie with several twists emotions and commotion. There's one thing that really may step the movie's promotion behind, and that's the point that common sense may think that the movie has some supernatural nature. It doesn't, the movie has its fantasy, but this isn't one of those movies that in the final 10 minutes has a completely CGI monster threatening to kill all mankind.Plunge in to this movie where everything in it is over the top, but the dark line is that, in my opinion the movie isn't one of those that can be chosen as the all time favorite of anyone. The script is inventive and deep, and the choose for directing was a nice touch Martin Brest was a director that in common opinion wouldn't have been a possible choice but as it was I stand correctly has his work is after all appraisable. On close inspection, for instance you can see there is no actual goof of any kind. Brad Pitt is actually revealing himself as a versatile actor, but still many people associate his name to teenager fan hysteria. Anthony Hopkins once more gives a show of acting, his calm and bland acting is always a joy to watch, (maybe) newcomer Claire Forlani is not only a beauty face but a beauty talent.

Much of the screen play was well imagined, many of the ideas were succinct and well portrayed, but the movie itself was slightly drawn out and repetitive. It was unique, though; as a parable I found Joe Black taught several important lessons about life in very emotional and dramatic ways. See if you can catch them all.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
Wonderful!!!!!,"Like others, I went to see ""Meet Joe Black,"" not knowing what I might expect, and found I loved every minute of it.  Though almost three hours in length, I did NOT want it end.This movie touched the depths of my very soul, and filled it with it's brilliant acting, direction, sound, color, imagery, etc. Certainly the most satisfying movie ever seen by these eyes.It is my opinion that this movie should garner every Oscar award applicable. Best Actor, Supporting Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Music, ad infinitum.Has anyone ever seen a more sensual, entrancing, bewitching movie?  I certainly haven't.Were I a published film critic critic, I would give 99.9 percent of the critics of ""Meet Joe Black"" ZERO stars for their criticism.  What is it with most critics?  I think they just wait for something to appear with Brad Pitt starring or Oliver Stone directing, and they get out their knives.  What is their problem?  Mayhaps we should start putting ""Critics"" in the same category with ""Lawyers"" ---- 10,000 lawyers at the bottom of the sea, etc.Brad Pitt is the most underestimated actor of our time.  Brad Pitt does more by doing less than any actor that comes to mind, with the possible exception of James Dean.  He is a fine, true minamalist.  Brad Pitt not only acts, but he reacts.  Maybe we should have a new category for Mr. Pitt.  Best Actor/Reactor.Lest I fail to say it, this was the best assemblage of Actor/Actresses in the history of motion pictures.  Every participant in this film deserves an Oscar.Bravo, Bravi, and Bravum.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

The Worst Film of 1998,"Though among 1998's movies were quite a bunch of doozies, the decidingly dudly and deadly doozie is Meet Joe Black.  A film of immense inanity, Meet Joe Black contains one of the worst performances of the year (model/dilettante Claire Fontani) and one of the most embarrassing (Anthony Hopkins -- after starring in a film this bad, I would never act again too.) The only performance that stings me with regret for giving the movie a rating of 1 is Marcia Gay Harden's.  Her scene with Anthony near the end of Meet Overwrought Opus when she tells him that she knows he doesn't love her as much as his other daughter (Claire Fontani -- As If!) is heartbreaking and the only scene with genuine emotion.  I won't even discuss Martin Brest's style and technique as a director because all that comes to mind is ""Hack, Hack, Hack.""",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
A beautifully made piece of cinema.,"I had quite low expectations before going in to see this movie, having heard so much bad press about it around the time of its release. How wrong I was, and what a great surprise it turned out to be. If, like me, you go in without any strong peconceptions of what it might/should be about then I think you'll love it. Claire Forlani is stunning, as is the chemistry between her and Brad Pitt. Hopkins gives what is surely one of his career-best performances and the film wanders along its superbly constructed narrative with class and wit. It is not, at 3 hours, overly long, any less and its conclusion would have been premature. Overall 'Meet Joe Black' is an extremely watchable piece of film-making without pretensions to be anything else other than an enjoyable story of love and yes, you guessed it, Death. Also, Look out for one of the most startling stunt scenes to hit the screens in recent times! Blink and you'll miss it.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

Beautiful film in spite of itself,"I have seen both the original 1934 film of Death Takes a Holiday, the 1971 TV-movie version, as well as the play on stage numerous times. I agree that in many ways, this film is superior, though mostly because of the very dated acting styles in the original.  Also, Claire Forlani turns in a luminous performance, as does Anthony Hopkins (as always).There are two elements from the original play which I miss in this remake. One is that the premise of the story is that Death appears in human form in order to find out why humans cling so desperately to life.  The other is that nothing on earth dies while he is on 'holiday.'  I realize these concepts don't fit well with the 'Hollywood-ized' happy ending, but I do feel they're at the core of the story. In all the stage versions and both earlier filmed versions, I found the premise of the girl (originally Grazia, then Peggy) being one who constantly defies--and seeks--death, who then goes with him, a very romantic ending.  It always felt as if she became immortal.Oddly, in all film versions, the role of Death has been miscast.  Brad Pitt is quite wooden, March silent-movie stiff, Markham a little too ingratiating.  Onstage, this role is usually cast with a true romantic leading man: handsome, suave, sensual. This does help make the whole story work. The original play's premise is that death arrives to take Grazia as she crashes her car, then he finds he can't because of her beauty and vitality.  I find this a much more solid and believable foundation for the story than the convoluted meeting between a guy and Susan in a coffee shop, and then at a dinner table.  Originally, SHE is the reason for it all--why he takes human form, why he takes a holiday, why he seeks the answer to his question.By opening up the film as Hollywood will do, all the stuff about Hopkins's business is extraneous and the idea of Joe attending at board meetings (and the IRS resolution) rather preposterous.  The original confined the story to a remote country house, the 1971 one confines the now Kennedy-like family to a private island.  Meet Joe Black did the opposite and brought in the whole world and is the worse for it.Yet MJB does work, in spite of itself.  Perhaps because the idea of seeing death in person and trying to figure out how he thinks is quite compelling. Despite his stature, Hopkins is not the center of the film, nor should he be.  Forlani is, and it is she who makes her scenes with Pitt work.  I was prepared to hate this film because I've loved the original story since I first saw it in about 1954, yet I find the film compelling and enchanting.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Spectacular,"Meet Joe Black is and adaptation of ""Death Takes a Holiday"" movie created in 1934 by director Mitchell Leisen. Meet Joe Black is about a man named William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) who is nearing his 50th birthday and soon discovers he doesn't have long to live. Enter Joe Black or ""Death""(Brad Pitt) who decides to visit William Parrish to offer him a deal where by William gets to live as long as Joe Black is kept entertained and William doesn't tell any one whom Joe Black really is. From this Joe experiences human life and eventually falls in love with Susan Parrish (Claire Forlani) William Parrish's daughter, with his new experiences with life and finding love Joe finds it hard to go back to his job. This movie is great for the romantic at heart and it also has a few tissue moments as well and not to mention a spectacular music score by Thomas Newman that burst out full of emotion. The movie has a well-known cast and the right essence added to it, which makes it wonderful to watch especially on DVD with all the added features. .",,Anonymous,Romance
This is not a Brad Pitt film - it's Anthony Hopkins',"Many people walk into Meet Joe Black expecting a Brad Pitt star vehicle. And while in many instances this is the case - the film really belongs to the character of Bill Parrish - stunningly played by Anthony Hopkins.Hopkins is wonderful in playing a rare screen character - a billionaire who is not an evil, manipulative bastard.Along with him, the entire supporting cast is excellent even though some of the material their characters are given are awfully cliche (Jake Weber's Drew)Brad Pitt is fine as a somewhat bewildered Death, and Claire Forlani makes an excellent effort in her first major role.Kudos go to the screenwriters too, as there is some great dialogue and speeches by all major characters in the film.I saw this film in a sold out theatre which certainly added to the atmosphere, but it was an excellent film all round.This is the one film in a long time where I have to completely disagree with the majority feelings of the critics.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A great mix of Drama, Romance and Fantasy","Meet Joe Black is a film that shows ambitious exploration of life, death, and the preciousness of human connection. Anthony Hopkins delivers a nuanced performance as William Parrish, a media mogul facing his own mortality. Enter Brad Pitt's Joe Black, a captivating personification of Death himself. Their unlikely encounter sparks a philosophical journey as Joe experiences the wonders and complexities of being human.While the film's near-three-hour runtime might deter some, it allows for a slow-burn exploration of themes. The romance between Susan Parrish (Claire Forlani) and Joe Black is unconventional, yet strangely believable. Their connection forces her to confront her own mortality and the fleeting nature of love.The performances are top-notch, the visuals are stunning, and the score by Thomas Newman is hauntingly beautiful.Ultimately, Meet Joe Black is a deeply moving film. It will make you laugh, cry, and contemplate the beauty and fragility of life.

Spectacular!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Judging from the reviews I guess that if this movie doesn't catch your interrest right off it never will, and then, yes, 3 hours is a VERY long time. However, it all went by fast, and I didn't take my eyes off the screen. (Many movies have me watching TV while they're running.) Admitted, yes, Pitt was a little too much sometimes, where he just seemed silly, but his preformance was captivating most of the time. It was genuinely intertaining to see this kind of manifestation of death. Majestic, powerful, utterly inconsiterate, but at the same time rather pathetic with no idea how to behave. Think 'Rainman meets the Terminator'. 9/10 if it catches your interrest. If it doesn't; you're in for 3 hours of solid boredom. But take a chance and rent it in any event..

Even when in the background he had presence.  When in the foreground he stole the scene. Quince's interaction with Joe, in the bar, was the icing on the cake for me. Quince's internal battle with his utter despair is as convincing a job of acting as I have seen in so many movies, and Marcia Gay is a close second for her performance.  Go see this movie.I highly recommend this movie to all adults and mature minded teens.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance

"A True love legend in Film, worthy of award nominations.","Director Martin Brest has helped himself to an exquisite sense of film making. He has not only managed to portray a story full of glittering, genuine and young romance but he has also been able to include a philosophical questioning within the plot.The question about death being a being just like humans, and if so, how would it be different from us in a sense of perceptions. Brad Pitt as death may not be what some of us will imagine it to be like but it sure is magical view from the director, that because it is unique turns out to be quite successful. Images that transmit a great spiritual meaning as well as a completely heart stopping quality in photography and music entertain the audience in what may originally seem a long period of time, but it is compensed with orchestration by Thomas Newman.The actors' effort is surely exemplified on screen. Anthony Hopkins delivers a magnificent performance in a character that faces a difficult question in his own life: What happens when your death is also your own daughter's? Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani show great on screen chemistry and it seem that they are growing as actors, since it is evident that they have gone deeply not only into their character's actions but their emotions as well.Overall an enthusiastic film, that in a dramatic and yet hilarious way teaches you about life, death and all kinds of love.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

The death also feels,"Meet Joe Black is an American film produced by Universal Pictures, which was launched in 1998 and directed by Martin Brest, (who also participated as director 6 years earlier in the movie Scent of a Woman, same which gave the oscar to Al Pacino). The movie counted with the participation of the Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins, known for his role of Hannibal Lecter, a young Brad Pitt, who during the 90's was able to consolidate a successful career becoming a sex symbol too, and finally with the impeccable performance of Claire Forlaine.The movie tells the story of Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), a telecommunications tycoon, who has a comfortable lifestyle and is surrounded by the caring of his 2 daughters. However, one day the death knocks on his door taking the physical appearance of a young man who during the same morning was able to captivate Bill youngest daughter Susan (Claire Forlaine) while they were having breakfast in a cafe, showing to her a passionate man, completely sensitive and quite unique to be real. Nevertheless, the death (Brad Pit) took the young guys body, and utilized it to enter into Bills home in order to follow and guide him on his last steps in the earth. Throughout the whole movie, Joe (That is the name the death adopted during his stay with Bill) achieves an approach to human life and the way in which they usually tend to love, leading him to behave for the first time as human being and taste a little bit of the cruelty of mortality. Moreover he accompanies and helps Bill on his last days alive, teaching him how to leave everything set before he passes away.The entire film turns out to be thought-provoking to any audience, due to the fact that it's possible to see how unexpected death could get to our lives, being in some cases aggressive or as in this case kind of gentle. Beyond the visual perspective, the 3 hours long movie (an aspect that has made the film receive plenty of critics) reminds us that once we have to abandon this world, the only thing we take with us are our memories and the love received by the ones who always accompanied us along the path of life.No matter how old you are, no matter the moment, this film needs to be watched and contemplated in the best way, since the message it conveys is able to have a deep impact on any kind of person.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Seemed kinda like a would-be-Heinlein book to me,"I suppose the usual critic for MJB is its length. Granted, when I did chose this movie to start the evening with I did not know that there would be so little left after the movie. THREE HOURS ... puh, well, a Harry Potter would have needed that amount of time, but for MJB it was way to much time and gave it a ""slow"" feeling.But it wasn't entirely bad. Although the story is not new (personally, I like the Death in Sandman by Neil Gaiman much better, and she is only mortal for a day  every hundred years) the setting was quite nice. A media mogul with an accomplished  life as a guide for death? Why not. The whole setting reminded me of the books of Robert A. Heinlein, where an old but wise man is often the guide for a younger and inexperienced person, hmmm, like a mixture of ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" and ""I Will Fear No Evil"". Regarding the need for guidance ... maybe death does not know what it is to live, but with the knowledge he has about other areas a normal dinner should be no problem for him - but perhaps it's the difference between seeing it done and experiencing it first hand.All in all the movie was a slow, nice distraction with a Brad Pitt for the female audience and a very attractive Claire Forlani for the male. There are better movies about death, like ""My Life Without Me"" for example and much better comics, like the mentioned Sandman-Comics by Neil Gaiman (""Death: The High Cost of Living"" for example or the Chapter ""The Sound of Her Wings"" in a Sandman-Edition). Both are way superior to this movie (sorry, Forlani).But it was o.k. for a slow evening (and the beginning of the night).4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Death takes on a new and stylish face,"""Meet Joe Black,"" is one of those movies whose plot and cinematic beauty will keep you watching, even for three hours. Brad Pitt is interestingly reserved in his portrayal of Death in the guise of Joe Black. Death has taken the body of this handsome man to learn more about the other side; life. In the process he discovers love with Susan Parrish, played by Clair Forlani. Susan happens to be the daughter of rich tycoon William Parrish, played by Anthony Hopkins. Death/Joe Black is giving Parrish a few extra days on earth while he explores life and all things human. The cimematography is exquisite, the sound track memorable and haunting, especially the melody the comes up each time Joe and Susan are alone together. The love scene between Susan and Joe is stylishly sensual; the fireworks scene outdoes Hitchcock's from ""To Catch A Thief."" In all the film, though at times slow to move, is nonetheless a feast for the eyes and mind as Death takes on a new and stylish face in ""Meet Joe Black.""",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

It felt like a giant ego-trip by the director to drag out every scene as though we are going to ponder the wisdom bestowed to us in every frame.And yet, I spent most of the movie wondering why no one ever asked what the afterlife was like!  Brad Pitt plays Death, he tells Anthony Hopkins he's going to die soon, and Hopkins doesn't ask about the afterlife or his dead wife or any of that.  It's not like the movie didn't have enough time to explore these aspects.

"Timeless classic, an exploration of love and emotional separation","Meet Joe Black is the story of death personafied. A thought provoking film about mortality and emotional separation.
An enchanting masterpiece which taught us about life and why you never takes it for granted.We believe, life flashes before your eyes when you're about to die, all the years, struggle, love, friendships and relationships waved in a blink. Joe Black is a fiesta of love and life, a reflective and philosophical tale.Yesterday was the 3rd time, I watched this film.
It reminded me of the good old days, a young college student thinking about exploring the world and falling in love. I had dreams which I want to live. I want to sell my talent to the world. I want to prove myself, I considered innocence is the art to captivate each and every detail of life but the world out there was harsh, full of predators. Well, I had my own moments. Received the compliments, appreciated by closed ones.I love this film because it remind me of my earliest life philosophies, which were bit different from nowadays.This is one of the finest film from Brad Pitt legendary filmography though Anthony Hopkins is the real master here, he was outstanding.The chemistry of Pitt and Claire Florani is magical, I loved the idea of ""Martin Brest"" to capture their emotions through eyes and it's been difficult for both Pitt and Forlani to showcase passion, obsession and madness as they communicate their characters to viewers largely by means of their eyes, which, as taught by ancient philosophers, are the windows of the soul. Emotions which words can't express, eyes do.In short, Meet Joe Black is timeless classic, an exploration of love and emotional separation. Your story will reflect in the 3 hour tale, a missing part which engages you till the end.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Romance
