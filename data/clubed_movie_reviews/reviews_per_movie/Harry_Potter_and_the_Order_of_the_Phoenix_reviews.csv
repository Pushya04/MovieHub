"A great movie, yet completely surpassed by the book","When I first walked into the movie, my expectations were not very high. The first two movies, I thought, were the best of the series mainly due to Richard Harris' dead-on portrayal of Dumbledore and screenplays that closely followed the original books. Though the third and fourth movies were very artistic and dramatic, I couldn't really connect to them in the way i had with the books. They glossed over many of the little things that made the Harry Potter series so magical in the first place, focusing on a select few plot lines and limiting dialog to only what was necessary to further the story.As a result they've felt more like a collage of scenes, a series of puzzle pieces, thrown at the viewers faster than they can piece together, just leading up to a final confrontation. Pacing has certainly been an issue, leaving fans feeling disjointed, and those new to the series confused as to what exactly is going on. In this respect, Order of the Phoenix was very similar to the previous two movies. As a Hollywood film, it deserves praise, bringing this amazing world to the big screen, telling a compelling tale, and keeping the viewers glued to their seats for the duration of the movie. However, to the die hard fans of the books, you will undoubtedly be disappointed.Many scenes that one would think invaluable to the story have been cut, replaced by the hasty filling in of plot holes. And while it pains me to ignore some of my favorite scenes from the book being left on the cutting room floor (St. Mungo's, Harry's Quibbler interview, the Quidditch fight, etc.), I realize that yes, not everything could be included in the movie. But in this watered down version of the book, there seems to be something missing. We still have all the drama and excitement, but some of the magic just seems to be gone.Aside from Evanna (couldn't have made a more perfect Luna), the kids give simply average performances, never really reaching the full potential put forth by JK Rowling's writing. The same goes for Gambon, who seems to have ignored the calm, all knowing, endearing idea of who Dumbledore is, in favor of a more erratic yet powerful headmaster. Sure, this works well in the more dramatic scenes (specifically the final battle), but otherwise, his performance falls flat, lacking the eye twinkling charm we came to love from the late Richard Harris. Thankfully, Imelda Staunton more than makes up for this in an amazing portrayal of Dolores Umbridge, one of the more fully realized characters of the movie. As for the rest of the cast, it's largely hit or miss, determined by how each scene is written.Overall, I would certainly recommend the movie for everyone, fan or not, as it really was a well made movie, despite a few wooden actors and some bad dialog. But when looking at the books, one really can't help but think how much more potential this movie could've had.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Playtimes over,"Within the first 5 minutes you can tell the series has undergone a dramatic tone shift and I have to say I think thats appropriate since Voldemorts return at the end of Goblet of Fire means that it's time to put aside childish things. The big bad men are here and they don't care about hurting children. it's time to get nasty.Gone is the frivolity of the first couple of movies where magic was cool and everything in this new and magical world was just wonderful to behold, a la World of Disney. The new director has taken some risks with style and approach and they've paid off brilliantly. Order of the Phoenix is probably the darkest of the five movies we've had so far, even more so than Azkhaban which was a step in the right direction for where the series would eventually be heading. There's very little ""fun"" in Phoenix and you can see why. The Dark Lord is back, it's no laughing matter and this movie actually sells that fact.This (in the movie world at least) is where Harry Potter crosses the line from kids movie to grown ups movie.Harry now has some serious mental scars (as well as his actual one of course) since the events of the previous movie which while lighter than Azkhaban, followed on well from that movie. The Ministry of Magic is in denial about Voldermorts return and are trying to control the flow of rumour stemming from the events of Goblet. To this end we have new teacher and Ministry stooge Dolores Umbridge. Pink and fluffy on the outside, crunchy and evil on the inside. She makes no qualms about re-ordering the law at Hogwarts putting the kybosh on anything even remotely fun and making the students lives a complete misery. What she put Harry through in detention was simply pure evil.She wasn't quite how I pictured her from the book but Imelda Staunton played her with a deliciously bitter/sweet twist, all charming and proper in her righteous delusions with that ""stab you in the back"" thing going on. She was a nasty piece of work.It is a shame that a lot of the content of the book was missing but it was a big book and although I can't put my finger on what wasn't in the movie (I read it a while ago now) it does sometimes feel that there should have more substance to a few areas, mainly the characterisation of some of the characters. Most of the major bits I remember from the book were in the movie. There's a pace here we haven't seen before, a new musical approach also puts a new twist on things and I think Harry Potters world seems to fit it's new clothes well. I'm eagerly anticipating what's next as I hear David Yates is also directing the Half Blood Prince (last I heard anyway) and since that book has zombies in it I think the new dark style will suit it awesomely thank you very much.The characters all look much older than they're supposed to be in Phoenix but it also kind of works in it's favour. They all look like they have a bit more history and life experience behind them, they're coping with stuff that will age any kid and it shows. That's also testament to the acting as well. Here mostly all the acting is pretty good, Ron Harry and Hermione all put in good efforts obviously having gotten the hang of the whole acting lark. Gambon is good as Dumbledore but I do miss Richard Harris and keep playing what might have been his versions of Gambons scenes over in my head. When I read the books it's Harris I'm picturing. Helena Bonham Carter gives a kooky insane kind of air to Bellatrix Lestrange (must get that from hubby Tim Burton) who was a pretty good character. One thing about this film though is that the actual Order of the Phoenix isn't in it all that much really. A flaw that wasn't in the book. The line about Snape being in the order, if you missed it you wouldn't even know he was in the order at all and a subsequent scene later on might seem confusing.Kreacher was well done I though, coming across as a real miserable old bugger which was appropriate. The producers apparently weren't going to put him in the movie at all but JK Rowling said they'd be stuffing themselves up for the final movie if they did that.All in all I think Phoenix is the best so far of the five movies, followed by Azkhaban, Goblet, then the other two in no particular order.Now I've just got hold of The Deathly Hallows and although it's quarter past five I'm off to bed so see you later....",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"Separate the film from the book, and you will be impressed","I actually was lucky enough to see this at a sneak preview on Monday. The ""experience"" was lousy, but the film was good...IF you take it as a separate entity from the series of books. If you separate the film from the book, you won't be disappointed.For the negative...there were, of course, MANY things that were omitted from the film. As a huge fan of the books, I still must be realistic. I knew there would be a lot of information left out. There were a few things that I felt could have made the story richer if they had been included, but I won't go into detail so I don't give away any of the film's changes. There were a few changes that made me frown at times, but as the story played out, it did make the film flow well. One of their worst casting decisions, Michael Gambon, was actually tolerable in this one, for the most part. I am NOT a fan of his portrayal of Dumbledore, but I guess he worked for this film simply because, for the majority of the story, he is supposed to be acting somewhat aloof towards Harry. That worked for him. I miss the subtlety that Richard Harris brought to that role, and, while he wasn't dreadful in this one, I still believe that there are countless other well known actors in the UK that could have done this role better justice. There wasn't enough Molly or Hagrid for me though. I love both of those characters.On a positive note, the special effects were very well done. The thestrals were marvelous--eerie, but strangely peaceful creatures. Evanna Lynch could not have been more spot on as Luna. Her voice, mannerisms and demeanor were amazing. My only complaint about her was that she wasn't on screen enough. :o) Imelda Staunton, as Umbridge, and Helena Bonham Carter, as Bella, have to be two of the BEST casting decisions that they have with regard to these films. They were SO incredible. I was actually quite impressed with Dan, Rupert and Emma as well. They have come quite far in their acting abilities. They have finally achieved the art of saying a lot without necessarily opening their mouths. The scene in the common room following the kiss between Harry and Cho was hysterical. Kreacher and Grawp were great additions to the films. Fred and George's exit was very well done, albeit slightly different. The film, if taken by itself, was really good. Unfortunately, it's a lot different from the book. But, as I'm doing a film review and not a comparison, I'll give it 8 out of 10, because I was highly entertained.Our ""sneak preview"" was interrupted in the middle due to a problem with the film, and I think we still missed some of it. We lined up 3 hours before the movie was supposed to begin, it started late, it was interrupted in the middle for over 30 minutes, we were wanded for metal and electronics every time we went in or out...I think we'll just wait until opening week next time. It's crowded, but a lot less trouble.We are actually going to see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Order of the Phoenix is about the Real World,"Why do Harry Potter movies give me, but not the children, nightmares? I've been wondering this for the past few years. Today, watching Movie No. 5, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (Warner Bros., 2007), I got my answer. Simply: Harry's world is the real world. As Harry and his friends mature, the line between the world of wizardry, magic, and Hogwarts and the world of self-centered, manipulative, cruel adults thins to the point of almost magical invisibility.Fantasy literature has since the beginning of time been about mediating and making sense of the real world; Harry Potter is part of this tradition.Indeed, one of the movie's first big special effects embodies this idea. As the movie opens, Harry is the subject of a smear campaign that Valdemore has cooked up because darkness works tirelessly to triumph over the light; when his friends come to rescue him from the suburban horror show known as his adoptive family, they take him to the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, a place that doesn't exist until a row of Georgian homes stretches out to reveal it. It's there, but the neighbors are unaware of it. They have no idea their building grew a house that the wizards and witches of the world can solve an internal problem. Such is life; how seldom do we know the inner workings, the coping mechanisms, the interior life of the people around us? In The Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter again does battle with evil to bring home the theme that when you fight, you fight well with and for your friends and to the death if necessary. Truth and goodness--call if love, if you want--are worth the trouble. The Gothic idiom of Harry Potter brilliantly takes the challenges Harry faces out of the present on one level even though these are very clearly 21st century characters facing contemporary challenges. Alongside the power of goodness over evil theme is the theme of the power of the imagination to find solutions to problems that are the same in every generation: politics, power games, jealousy, stupidity, growing up.Always in Harry Potter is the clear distinction between the good guys and the bad ones right alongside the good kids and the annoying kids, who could very well become evil people if they so choose. They are tragic because they don't understand the long-range consequences of their petty cruelties--but then, as we learn in this movie, even the good kids are capable of petty cruelties that break souls. Always there is Snape, the middling Hogwarts employee who is not clearly good but not clearly bad but capable of both (until fate forces his hand in Book 6).J.K. Rowling doesn't let anybody off of the hook of responsibility for their choices. But she does present the internal struggle for goodness and justice for the mess that it can be. Just as the Gothic world of Hogwarts helps Harry and his friends mediate the real world, so Rowling helps her readers see the world for what it is. This is a world that can give me nightmares, though not my daughter and my nephews. Perhaps because all they really need is an honest story.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Nothing like the book but a decent enough movie,"So many great parts were skipped over, rushed with ridiculous cliché transition scenes, or simply changed because, apparently, it's impossible to include everything. But what can anyone reasonably expect?I went into this expecting exactly what I saw, it's still just a tad annoying hearing people talk about how impossible it would be to follow the book. It's not impossible at all. Look at the matrix 2&3, look at pirates of the caribbean 2&3, look at LOTR (it's all one continuous story). Lots of ""stories"" have had to be split up into multiple films and they all worked great. It's just a tad short-sighted to say it wouldn't work with a harry potter film. I think a lot of what people enjoy is looking at the wizard world, seeing cool looking spells, and generally learning more about everything to do with the harry potter universe. You don't get much of that when a 26 hour read is condensed into a 2.5 hour film. I personally would love to see more of the ""boring"" parts of the book simply because it's interesting seeing a high-budget Hollywood interpretation of what was in the book. Maybe it's just me, but I wouldn't be the least bit disappointed if the film-makers simply came out and said ""this book is too long to put into a single film with out leaving out a lot of the book and changing a lot of other parts, so we're releasing it in two films."" It's completely understandable. It's an 800 page book! LOTR books were only 400-600 pages and the films were considerably longer than any of the harry potter films.Overall, it was a decent enough movie though. Great special effects, good enough acting (I wouldn't go so far as to say it was amazing). I'd say it's basically a standard high-budget film. Entertaining to watch, well worth my $10 so I could come and complain how it was nothing like the book :)",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"JK's biggest book to the screen, mission impossible?  Mission accomplished!!!","For the avid Harry Potter reader the whole suspense leading up to HP Order of the Phoenix can be summed up in the word ""how"". How are they going to translate a nearly 900 page book to the screen, how are they going to tie together a storyline that in the 5th book breaks into dozens of streams like a mighty river coming to its delta.This seemingly impossible task is well accomplished by astute summation of plot and concentration of action. Also, the heart and soul of the book, i.e. the thematic spirit of the story and Rowling's shining gift for characterization are given the fullest support in this film more so than in any previous HP movie.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix basically involves Harry being persecuted by the government for telling a truth they refuse to believe all while dealing with the same feelings of teen angst and emerging love that any ordinary teen finds stressful and consuming. Only through the love and dedication of family and especially friends does Harry come across the means to fight back against the government, elude his enemies and make some sense of his emotional turmoil.Most reader's will come out of the theater saying ""I wish they had shown this or that."" However, all will leave satisfied that they have been treated to a faithful rendering brilliantly acted and directed. All the HP movies are a ""good watch"" but in this one we get a great movie.We have the advantage of going to our HP movies with a non-reader and she was, to say the least, blown away and pronounced it a near classic. My daughter and myself have read and reread the books many times over and came out limp from exhilaration, our keen anticipation very much fulfilled.A few highlights: The acting is best ever. The three principles push themselves to a new level. My favorite new characters were Imelda Staunton as Delores Umbridge, excellent (you'll love to hate her) and Natalia Tena as Tonks. Natalia is sheer delight. She is the penultimate punk rock witch girl(think Dead Milkmen here). And Helena Bonham Carter is in her medium (she played the witch Morganna in the movie Merlin) as the dangerous and demented Bellatrix LeStrange.Battle scenes: breathtaking. Commraderie: The only HP that actually caused me to get teary so heartfelt are the portrayals of friendship and family.See the film knowing that unless you want a 10hour movie some things are going to have to go. Leave having enjoyed a film that takes the beans and water and instead of a nice large coffee treats one to a perfectly concentrated, most artfully brewed and extremely tasty espresso. It has been said before but truth is truth: BEST YET!",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"My Least Favorite Up To This Point, Maybe Overall","With their warning about Lord Voldemort's return scoffed at, Harry and Dumbledore are targeted by the Wizard authorities as an authoritarian bureaucrat slowly seizes power at Hogwarts.At this point in the series, the story takes a decidedly darker and more sinister turn. This could be because of the subject matter: the students spend less time in class and more time preparing for real world evil. It could also be the introduction of a new crew. Not only has the director changed (again) but the screenplay has a new hand, making the very feel somewhat off. I have not read the books, but I get the impression a great deal was left out to account for time and to make the plot run smoother.The best addition to this film from previously ones is Luna Lovegood. She was apparently in the books for a while as a minor character but did not come on to the movies until now. Her role is fairly small, but important, and her character adds the one bit of lightness to this script (aside from possibly the Weasley's pranks). They cast the perfect actress.What really stands out about this film is how political it is. Parallels could be made between this and the rise of fascism or McCarthyism. There is talk of order, obedience, conformity, the need for a government to have a firm hand and to protect its own butt when damaging information comes to light. We know from the previous film that Voldemort is back, and the Ministry of Magic likely knows it, too. But they go out of their way to deny this and blame other people for terrible acts that have occurred. This political act of protecting a reputation slows down the process of preparing for Voldemort and stands in the way of clearing Sirius Black's name. The outcome could have been much improved and lives could have been spared if the government was simply honest.I believe this to be the weakest film up to this point. I did not care for the shift in spirit (the opening seemed more like a drama than a fantasy film). And i did not like feeling like parts were missing. The plot was almost made too simply, especially compared to prior episodes where mysteries had to be solved. There was no twist or surprise here, just a throwaway film to get you to the next one.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Amazing movie put forth by a stellar cast!,"Once again, I believe that the series is only getting better with each progressive movie. I attended a preview screening tonight and was completely blown away by the movie. While quite a bit of detail was lost in the movie, how can you really expect a three hour movie to capture what takes Rowling hundreds of pages to explain? This said, Yates did a great job capturing the spirit of the book, and he had me on my seat from the first scene all the way through the end of the movie. I cried, I laughed, and I am pretty sure there were a few times where I couldn't breathe from the tension.What really made the movie for me was the talent of the actors. As expected, the older cast members deliver some of the best acting England has to offer. Sidenote: there is something about Emma Thompson where every time she cries in a movie, I start tearing up myself. I was especially impressed with how much Daniel, Emma (Watson), and Rupert have improved their acting since the last movie. Having come from seeing Daniel in Equus two weeks ago, I was expecting a lot from him. Even after seeing him display more intensity than I thought possible on stage, he surprised me in Phoenix. His emotions were so raw and genuine that I literally got goosebumps.Well done to the cast and crew! I can't wait for the next one!!",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Slow First Half Picks Up in Finale,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007)** 1/2 (out of 4)Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is brought back to school where he faces a possible expulsion after using magic in the real world. Dumbledore (Jim McManus) comes to his defense and soon the two of them are warning people of the return of Lord Voldemort.As I've said in the reviews for the previous films, I haven't read any of the stories so I honestly can't compare the movie to the book. With that said, I did find the previous installment to be an extremely entertaining movie and certainly the best of the series to date. This fifth film is certainly a major step backwards and sadly there are way too many boring moments to make it a complete winner.Again, perhaps I would have picked up on more things had I been familiar with the book but I personally found the majority of the first half to be quite boring without too many interesting things going on. I honestly thought there was very little character development and I thought too many of the scenes just kept dragging on with dialogue that just wasn't all that interesting or thrilling.The film does finally pick up during its final act and this is where thing get really good. The final battles almost rival what we saw in the previous film and there's no question that they pack a lot of energy and excitement. They also benefit from some wonderful special effects that really put you in the middle of the action and blend perfectly well with the cast members. Speaking of the cast, a lot of talented actors keep getting added to the series and once again everyone is quite impressive. Regulars like Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and others return to their roles quite nicely and people like Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman and David Thewlis are of great value.",,Anonymous,Action
"A ""Cliff Notes"" version of the book","I've been eagerly awaiting this episode, thinking it was going to be much more action-packed or incorporating some of the more juicy bits of narrative from the over-800 page book. I ought to have known going in that, at 2:18 running time, the movie was too short. Even considering the tweaking that needed to be done to incorporate information differently than the book presents it (like by-passing the house elves storyline), at least a half-hour more could've been left in to really build up the story. The scenes we do see are well acted, there are obvious clues alluding to the final installment, and the special effects are dazzling. But one leaves the theater breathless and disoriented as if one ate a rich meal too quickly. Especially exasperating considering we had to sit through 20 minutes of TV commercials and coming attractions--I would've paid extra to see another 20 minutes of movie instead.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
"its OK, but don't expect too much","Pretty much what you'd expect, I wanted to like it but found it hard to.It wasn't a bad film and I'm not sure how people who haven't read it will find it, but there's too much cut from the book.There were quite a few cuts that I didn't miss at all but there was time and space for a few scenes which would have helped move the story along.Out go the quidditch and st mungos and the giants and most of grimmuld place and most of the climax in the dept of mysteries. And time is spent focusing on the kid's relationships and such. (Apparently). It seemed to be on Harry 95% of the film.With SO much character development in the book there was always going to be a problem to condense it, but like the last film it moves so fast it feels like a 2 hour long montage and seems to just hint at whats going on while assuming you've probably read it and can fill in the blanks yourself.I have read it - and I struggled to get into the movie.It never quite finds its place and just serves as a visual feast for fans.Some good gags and a lot of missed opportunities, LOTS, and some big continuity errors.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Imelda steals the show,"Overall, not a bad film, especially the opening sequence which'll have you quivering behind the seat in front! Great effects as always.For me, Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge completely steals the show. Her character was fantastically well observed - the odd little hysterical titters of laughter she gave had superb comedic timing. Helena Bonham Carter had a star turn too as Belatrix - she's completely bonkers and HBC totally did her justice! Loved it!For me, both their successes stood out conspicuously when compared to the horrendously awkward acting from the younger members of the cast. Sorry(!) but there were so many cringe worthy moments (especially the more intimate ones) where you kept begging the director to cut away from the acting. Tighter editing could have prevented these distracting moments from constantly reminding me I was watching actors on a set.Hermione (Emma Watson), Luna (Evanna Lynch) , and Cho (Katie Leung) were the main culprits, with Daniel Radcliff not falling far behind. Okay, I know they're supposed to be awkward teenagers in the story, but hey! My suspicion is that these poor kids feel so caught up in the huge franchise that is HP that the pressure to perform must be enormous. Couple that with the screenplay's stilted dialogue, and being surrounded by what must have been a huge crew with them all staring at you, it's hardly a surprise that a few cracks were shown. Still, you'd have thought the editing might have been able to get around it.These cringes aside, I enjoyed the film. Also, a huge congrats to all those involved in the hard work that obviously went into the post production too.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Loved it,"I have not yet read any of these books but find myself very much engaged in the films. That being said, im not the best judge to the faithfulness of movie to book. However, I can say this, I loved this film. In my opinion it did go with less of the magic, which really made you feel what the kids were going through. The pacing is very good, slow in some parts, but overall good. The performances are much better this time around and it has quite a few stand up and clap moments. It is much better written and directed than the previous efforts, although azkaban is still my favorite, this would have to be second. The ending felt a little rushed and I wish there was more voldemort, but these are very little gripes for a great film truly pushing the limitations of children's story. It really makes you drool for the next picture, especially if you do not read the books. I really hope harry becomes this amazing wizard like it keeps promising and the final battle is full fledged amazing. We will see. Anyway, it's a beautiful film with great performances and dazzling special effects. This one really steers toward an older crowd and I feel younger children might get bored with it, but not us older kids. I don't want to spoil this for everyone, so ill just sum it up by saying that I don't feel this series is losing steam, just gearing up for an amazing finale, and if this transitional film has anything to say about it, I can't wait to see where it goes.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

"Humorous, But Hard To Follow If You Haven't Read The Book","If you scan the first hundred reviews of this movie on this website, I think you'll see the words ""disappointed"" and ""disappointment"" more than any other adjectives. I, too, found it the same. I have not read any of the books, but I've seen - and enjoyed - the four previous movies, so I expected to full enjoy this one.This film disappointed me because (1) - I felt the story was nothing I could make a lot of sense out of, since I hadn't read the 800 or 900-page book. If one didn't read the book and knew this story, it was easy to get lost about a number of things in here. The screenplay was ""choppy,"" hard to follow in spots. Some of the things, like the death of Sirius Black, happened so fast I didn't know exactly what happened. This was just too uneven and rushed to keep us non-HP readers interested, story-wise; (2) - Harry wasn't the nice little kid throughout most of it, and he admitted it - that he was angry most of the time. Well, I agree, and he wasn't fun to watch, as he had been in the other films. I am used to a good-kid HP, not an angry teen; (3) - His two closest buddies, Ron and Hermione, looked like they mailed in their roles, especially Ron who looked like he was half-asleep during the film. (Maybe he was pouting because he had so few lines, who knows? I wouldn't blame him, frankly.); (4) I get tired of filmmakers giving us the rebel-as-hero and authority figure-as-villain. Enough is enough on that theme, which is so heavy-handedly presented here it becomes ludicrous. (5) If you are going to have a major villain, SHOW him, don't hide him for 99 percent of the film, which is what they did here with Voldemort.On the positive side, I DID get enjoyment out of all the little special effects, many of which were humorous and always fun to watch. I got a kick out of many of the new faces in the film, and it also was fun to see some characters we had seen only in perhaps one previous film, such as Emma Thompson's teacher role. I also thought the music was outstanding: the best I've heard in the five Potter films. I wonder how many others appreciated it in here?All in all, it was visually fun to watch and hear, as all the HP movies have been, but the story was just not entertaining as much as the others.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Slow Down!,"I love the Harry Potter books, and I've always liked the movies. That's why I was very excited to go see the latest installment of the series. However the movie did not at all live up to my expectations; to me it felt rushed and choppy. I realize that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was a very long book, but so was The Goblet of Fire and I enjoyed it's movie adaptation a lot. In this movie seemed as though the director merely had a check list of scenes that he needed to but in the movie put no thought into connecting them. The speed and choppiness of the movie took away from the characters. It was just events and there was hardly any character development at all. Which was a shame because the young cast continues to get better, and there were some amazing acting veterans (Gary Oldman, Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter etc.) In my opinion if the director had slowed everything down, only a little, he could've added a lot more (character development, humor, fluidity) However, despite by prier comments, the movie was not terrible. It did have it's good moments, but I think it could have been done a lot better.",5.0,Anonymous,Action
"Not without its flaws, but highly entertaining.","After his fourth traumatic year at Hogwarts that ended with a showdown with the franchise's very own Mr Bad, Lord Voldemort, it doesn't seem too much for Harry Potter to be asking for a peaceful Summer. However, he doesn't get such a wish  from the opening scene in which Harry and his despised cousin Dudley have close encounters of the life-threatening kind with two dementors in an underground passage, it is clear that Voldemort has unfinished business with the scarred lad, and that he has every intention of finishing it. Plus, nearly everyone in Harry's school believe him to be a liar, Professor Dumbledore refuses to look him in the eye, his friends don't understand him, and, on top of that, Harry must grapple with the skills required in mastering his first kiss. My, my, aren't teenage lives complicated?!A word of warning. This is not a film for the uninitiated. If ""patronum"", ""Avada Kedavra"" and ""ministry of Magic"" sound like code to you, then best avoid watching this. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix makes no attempt to guide the newbies along the story (and rightly so, because any attempt at that would detract from the film and patronize its viewers). To fully comprehend the plot, you must have seen the four previous films as well as read the book from which this film is based.The film itself is a wonderful jumble of goods, bads, and uglies. There is plenty to enjoy here, starting with the flawless turn from Imelda Staunton as the sadistic Dolores Umbridge. The woman who we are so used to seeing in roles as the sweet old lady, whether it be in Shakespeare in Love, or her Oscar-nominated turn in Vera Drake, her performance here is a shock and a half. Kitted out from head to toe in pink and sporting a sugary air, we soon find that Umbridge, whose methods of punishment include using quills that protract blood on her students, is anything but sweet. Staunton captures Umbridge's ruthless oiliness perfectly; never before has evil been such fun to watch.Rupert Grint is also a joy. His ginger hair, large blue eyes, bumbling demeanour and spot-on comedy timing make him the true star of the show, and every scene that he features in benefits as a result of his appearance. Simply put, he is Godly. Sadly, the other two teen stars are nowhere near as good as Grint; Radcliffe, who gave an adequate performance in the West End's Equus, is back to his shoddy self here with an array of overreaching facial expressions and laughable deliveries of his lines. He is most embarrassing of all in the lead-up to kissing Cho Chang, in which everyone in my cinema was collapsing with laughter at his ""performance."" But it gets even worst, for Emma Watson, aspiring Cambridge student, World Peace Representative (probably) and general object of annoyance to average, frumpy teenage girls such as myself, gave a performance that was so awful, it damn near lost me the will to live. She just couldn't portray any of her emotions convincingly, and just settled for saying the lines that were written for her. Whereas Hermione was one of my favourite characters in the book due to her kindness, knowledge and appreciation for others' feelings, Emma's presentation of Hermione makes her insufferable and punch-worthy. It ain't good.The two ""actors"" aside, my main other foible with this film was how it cut/altered some very important details of the book. For example, in the book, it is Kreacher who betrays Sirius and puts him in danger. The appearance of Snape's past as a hated and bullied student is also poorly put together and left to linger rather than properly dealt with. The Cho Chang storyline is pitiful, whereas in the book, we had been led to see that she wasn't all that she had cracked up to be as a person, in the film, she is the sketchiest of sketches and written off practically before she has begun. In terms of 2007 releases, only Pirates of the Caribbean III had more plot holes than this.That said, I had a huge amount of fun in the 2 and a half hours that this film played, with three newcomers to this movie, Yates (director), Michael Goldenberg (screenwriter) and Hooper (composer). The direction was apt, not perfect, but acceptable. The score was acceptable. The visual effects were stunning, especially in the climactic finale between Dumbeldore's Army and Voldemort's Deatheaters, led by Jason Isaacs, where an entire storeroom containing shelved globes containing prophecies, one of which concerns Harry. It is here that Helena Bonham Carter emerges as Bellatrix Lestrange, one of the final and greatest joys of the film. Laughing manically and sporting long hair greasier than a Professor Snape-Cristiano Ronaldo mixup, she makes the most of her limited screen time to deliver one of the best performances in all the Harry Potter movies. Utterly haunting.Thus, verily I say, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a worthwhile outing. If you can put up with the abomination commonly known as ""Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson trying to act"", as well as the slightly pretentious over-editing of Harry's dream sequences, not to mention the ten thousand odd plot holes, then you should venture out to the cinema to see this. Not capital film-making, but, as I'm yet to see Ratatouille and The Simpsons movie, about as good as you'll get this Summer from the cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Snivellus Snape gets what he deserves!,"Oh you can shake Snape up! Oh you anyone can shake Snape up! Like boob fat, shake shake Snape, shake shake Snape, shake shake! Oh I love this film so much!Bellatrix is such a lovely lady and she always cheers me up and turns my usual frown upside down every time I see her lovely nurturing motherly nature on display in this terrific top notch film. Bellatrix is the most sexiest and kindest woman alive in my humble opinion and I wish she was my Mother, tells me I'm a naughty boy and looks after me every day so that's a great testament to how much I adore this film. I know nothing bad will happen to me when I'm watching this film because I know Bellatrix Motherly instincts will protect me from any harm that comes to me, oh I love her so much, I wish I could hug her all the time to show her how much I love her.James Potter was a great man, my 2nd favourite fictional character of all time and he showed that sobbing little man baby known as Snivellus Snape who's boss and I always cheer and clap every time I see that lovely Snape memory scene in this film as Snape gets some payback for having fashion sense that gives people nightmares, an annoying tendency to read and study things all the time and forever being an evil know it all. James and his friends are really complex memorable characters full of enlightening personality traits and they are great role models for British boys and this film always makes me appreciate that I have friends like James Potter did that I can have great fun with. This film is guaranteed to make you smile if you're a British boy crying out for some motherly affection.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
'Phoenix' May Be Best 'Potter' Yet!,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the 5th installment out of 7 in the story of Harry Potter. With the release of this film as well as the final literary installment of the series, 'Potter 'has received a great abundance of exposure (as if it needed it). In 'Phoenix', Harry and Dumbeldore are targeted by the Ministry of Magic after claiming (correctly) that the dark Lord Voldemort has been reborn. A sadistic member of the Ministry is installed in Hogwarts who slowly takes over the entire school. Meanwhile, a secret organization, the Order of the Phoenix, recruits Harry, and prepares for the Dark Lord's return. As the story gets darker, the films get better. This film (while it was not the best book in the series), is quite possibly the 'Potter' film yet. The teenage as well as adult cast excel while visuals and special effects are nothing less than top notch. While the film did do a good job making a page 896 book into a 2 hour and 15 minute movie, I do wish that it could have been longer to include more details and sub-plots which were cut either in post production or during the writing process. The explosive finale is incredible and will cast a spell on you throughout. 'Phoenix' is a must see for any 'Potter' fan, while others will still find it an enjoyable ride.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

Introducing the Nurse Ratched of Hogwarts,"This fifth installment in the Harry Potter franchise doesn't match Alfonso Cuaron's cinematic vision brought to life in the third film, but it is an improvement over its immediate predecessor, ""Goblet of Fire."" It shares some of that film's sense that a tremendous amount of plot is being squeezed into too short a film, and that all sorts of things that might bring subtlety and nuance to the story are being left out, but it's crisper and better adapted -- you don't have to have read the book to understand what's going on.The most persuasive argument for watching ""Order of the Phoenix"" is to see Imelda Staunton's deliciously evil turn as Dolores Umbridge, a kind of fascist grandmother decked out like Jackie Kennedy, who may just have to kill you if you break her rules. She's the Nurse Ratched of Hogwarts, and you can tell Staunton is having a ball playing her. Well, I had a ball watching her....Grade: B",7.0,Anonymous,Action

The Order,The Order of the Phoenix is the first of the series from the best Director Harry Potter had (David Yates) and it shows. I'm going back and rewatching these all in sequential order and this one surprised me the most as it's a lot better and more enjoyable than I remember. The story line is fantastic. Harry and his crew train and gear up for what's to come. The Order is introduced and helps. And Voldemort and his side also start to gain power and momentum. We also get to see the Order fight Voldemort's minions AND Dumbledore fight Voldemort. This was an extremely fun and underrated movie in the series.,8.0,Anonymous,Action
"Good movie, Mediocre Adabtation","Plot: Harry saves his cousin Dudley from two dementors, but by using magic outside of school he needs to go to a trial. After being found not guilty, he spends the rest of the summer at his Godfathers Sirius' house. When he goes back to school, his new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher Miss. Umbridge basically tortures him, Hagrid is missing, Dumbledore won't look at him, and Harry keeps having dreams about a door at the end of a long hallway.Review: Let me just say this, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a good film, but as an adaptation, it's only OK. In terms of an adaptation it's basically about as good as The Last Airbender, as in, they got enough for the basic story, but there's so much cut out. This is the only Potter film not to be written by Steve Kloves, and the first directed by David Yates. It certainly shows that this film had a different writer, and to be fair I'm not saying the writer Michael Goldenberg (who also did Green Latern) did a bad job, but he could've done much better. For example Quittich is completely gone, Harry saw his dad tormenting Snape in the Penesive, not by memory charm, young Lily doesn't appear, We don't see St. Mungo's and don't see Neville's parents, Rita Skeeter isn't in it, Kreacher barely appears, Aunt Petunia doesn't get a Howler, Hedwig isn't injured, and much more is either left out or changed. One other thing I don't like is the message of friendship is shoved down your throats near the end, I know that was a theme of the book but it wasn't forcing it. Also a minor nitpick, in the first book, it was established that Harry could grow his hair back in one night, so why is his hair so short in this movie?After all that ranting, let's talk about why I like this film. Once again, the actors do a great job, and this film also also gives us two of the best casting decisions after the three main leads. Imelda Staunton was perfects as Umbridge, I wanted to smack her in the face. And Evanna Lynch was absolutely flawless in her portrayal of Luna. The special effects are great, the last battle between Voldemort and Dumbledore was pulled off well in my opinion, some say that Dumbledore looked scared and was weaker than in the book, but I don't think that was how the book portrayed the battle. The effects in that scene alone make this film worth watching. And the humor works really well, and like I said, it follows the main plot of the show, just like The Last Airbender, but people seemed to hate that film.So yes, I like Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, it's fun, a good film, but as an adaptation, it's mediocre. Because of this, it is my least favorite film in the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
A Great Transition From Book to Film!,"Whenever I watched this movie for the first time years ago, I was very skeptical as to how this movie would play out, considering they are cramming an 800 page book into less than two-and-a-half hours. Nevertheless, somehow, someway, they managed to succeed in what they were doing, and made (in my opinion) the best film in the series yet. I like better than the previous four films because the stakes were a lot higher and it just felt grander and everything that happened felt like it happened for a reason. I really just think that everything was improved since the last film. Overall, they somehow managed to make an enjoyable film out of an 800 page book, without having a massive runtime of like three hours.8.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
An adaptation that cannot stand on its own,"It's been years since I wrote the following words in my user comment for the first Harry Potter movie: ""I enjoyed this movie immensely. But...I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books."" By now, I must admit that the movie has held up well over all those years. It is a superior fantasy, despite my reservations about Chris Columbus's directorial style.Unfortunately, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is not likely to hold up well in the future. It has precisely the problem that I worried the first film would have: it seems designed for those who have already read the book. Those who haven't will be confused out of their mind. Necessary plot connections are left out, and the relevance of certain material is never explained. One pivotal scene even references a particular character's code name from the Marauder's Map, something that has never been mentioned before in the movie series and which will make no sense at all to non-readers. And yet, as a reader, I did enjoy the film. I once called the first Harry Potter movie a ""preview of the book,"" but this one fits that description much more.Part of the problem is not the movie itself, but the gradual decline of the books. In ""Order of the Phoenix,"" the series lost much of its sense of fun as it got bogged down in the ongoing story. It contained a few elements I really liked, amidst pages of matters I found unappealing. What held it together was a wonderfully horrible villainess, Professor Umbridge, who functions as a satire of England's educational system. Even as an American, I can relate to the criticism of schoolteachers who favor theory over practice, preferring textbook assignments to practical skill-building. In the Harry Potter universe, that leaves the students in mortal peril, keeping them from learning the skills they need to protect themselves against Voldemort, the super-villain whom Umbridge, a puppet of the magical government, denies has returned. Harry creates a secret club to teach students how to defend themselves. All the while, Umbridge inflicts a reign of terror on the school, with harsh and sometimes painful punishments for anyone--student and teacher alike--who steps out of line.At 870 pages, it is the longest Harry Potter book, and I believe it should have been cut down. The manner in which Harry languishes through the ordeal becomes monotonous, with long sections in which not much happens. By contrast, the movie is the shortest in the series so far, less than 2 hours and 15 minutes if you don't count the credits. I expected this condensation to benefit the film, but instead it makes the whole proceedings choppy. Just a few minutes of extra screen time could have substantially improved the coherence. It gives me a greater appreciation for how the third movie--still by far the best one--achieved the paradoxical effect of streamlining the story while seeming richer and fuller in some ways.I have never heard of the director, David Yates, and I don't understand why he's already been chosen to direct the next Harry Potter film. The series has already had two skillful directors, Alfonso Cuarón and Mike Newell, each brought on for just one film. Maybe Harry Potter directors face the same Catch-22 as James Bond actors, namely that anyone good enough for the job has better things to do in their career.Yates makes a mixed impression at best. He gives the film some of the most unoriginal imagery the series has yet seen, drawing upon old horror movie conventions as Harry is haunted by dreams and visions of Voldemort. The technical credits show some lack of continuity with the previous films. A couple of creatures look different, and John Williams' charming score has been inexplicably replaced by a more generic one.On the bright side, the performances are mostly quite good. Familiar cast members like Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, and Gary Oldman continue to bring warmth and style to their roles. Daniel Radcliffe maintains his natural, understated performance that goes well with the introspective tone of the story. Actors I have not admired as much, such as Rupert Grint as Harry's friend Ron, and Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, seem to have improved significantly. There are also some impressive newcomers to the series: Evanna Lynch as the flaky Luna Lovegood, Helena Bonham Carter as the Wicked Witch-like Bellatrix Lestrange, and Imelda Staunton, who seems to provide a perfect embodiment of the short and shrill Umbridge. The weakest link is Ralph Fiennes, whom I suspect spent no more than a day filming his scenes as Voldemort. He seems to disappear into the makeup, making me wonder what was the point of bringing such an esteemed actor to this role.The movie has some nice touches that weren't in the book, such as Umbridge's office being lined with moving photographs of meowing cats (I suspect that Yates is a cat lover, like myself) and Filch crowding the walls with Umbridge's inquisitorial decrees. But my favorite scene from the book--Dumbledore's hilarious exit--is truncated here and considerably less effective. Other crucial scenes seem to have no purpose except for setting up what is to come in the later films. Overall, this is the worst Harry Potter adaptation to date.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Probably my favourite of the bunch,"Though I perceive the whole series pretty much as a single entity to be binged completely or not watched at all, when I think about an order of preference this movie is definitely up there contending for the first place. The reason is Umbridge. Though while binging I kind of dread her arrival, she is a character I just love to hate. As pointed out many times already, she is a sort of villain, many of us have met and will meet in our lives which makes her all the more real, the story more personal. Add on top of that Sirius personal consequences and a killer third act that IMO superseeds any of the later movies and this might just be my favourite. FYI the next in line would be the first movie, which though has its problems, the nostalgia is just heavy. It (the first one) captured how I imagined the books pretty much exactly.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Haphazard film-making makes for a rather disappointing fifth part of the series,"Even though I am only a moderate fan of the books (meaning I have yet to finish the last book, despite having it since the day it came out), I usually look at the release of a new Harry Potter as something to get excited about. Even though the quality is not always spot-on, there is just something about them that allows them to feel wondrous and fantastical all at once. And even with their numerous problems (albeit, not as bad as those associated with The Lord of the Rings trilogy), they still end up being rather enjoyable. Sadly, I think the quality has really begun to slip, as Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was the first film since Philosopher's Stone that actually disappointed me as a film-goer and reader of the books.I will not shed too much light on the plot (and the numerous subplots) that densely layer this fifth instalment, but suffice to say for those who have yet to venture through the book, will find Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) on thin ice with the wizarding world in regards to his accusations over the return of Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). But as those close to him rally to fight against the Dark Lord, Harry just may have to face a few more problems than he probably would like to.Going in, I knew Order of the Phoenix was going to be a challenging watch. The book is the longest of the entire series, and is probably the densest. I liked it when I first read it, but subsequent re-readings of mere selections from the book have proved tiresome, and quite long-winded. Much the same then, has to go for the film. There is quite a bit going on, but you never quite feel like you are truly experiencing a genuinely well written storyline. Yes, it does feel very in tune with being just part of the larger framework of an entire series, but at least the others (with the minor exception of Goblet of Fire), have attempted to stay fairly within itself and not completely determinant on the audience having seen the previous films in order to fully understand this one.While Order of the Phoenix does pack in a whole lot more of the book than the previous film did, it does so at a price. Many of the key subplots and even key story lines have been compacted into sometimes lengthy montage sequences. And while this would not be a problem in any other movie, it quickly becomes irritating here for just how many times it is done as time progresses on. At one point, it would be safe to say two montages were split by a sheer two minute scene. And these were five-minute montages! I am certain that they could have either compacted some of these scenes even further, or just fleshed a few more out. It would have helped the characters and the story be so much more well rounded than it is.What the film also does not do is improve upon the shallow and ultimately anti-climactic ending. Instead, as hard as it is to believe, it is made worse. The initial start of the build-up towards the finale is very well done, and very well realized, but right when the real heavy hitting elements begin to pop up, the film falters. Besides not looking anywhere near what J.K. Rowling's original written words described, it feels genuinely rushed, and almost a second thought. If I had not read the book, I probably would have found much of the sequence to be rather incoherent, and other parts just totally misplaced. It just does not seem to be as well made and polished as other scenes in the movie, and everything from the acting, to the special effects, to even the story itself, suffer as a result.Speaking of special effects, what happened to them? In previous films, the artists and designers worked hard to make everything look so realistic and so well blended together that one would never realize the difference between reality and fantasy. But here, almost every effect (with a few minor exceptions, one being the awesome opening sequence of the finale) looks very haphazardly created, and with zero to no enthusiasm for what was being created. People look fake in a lot of scenes, and the totally CGI-rendered characters stand out as almost blatantly not real.But then, that is what this film really stands out to me as: a blatant unenthusiastic romp through a very messy book. The performances are all very well done (with a brilliant standout being Imelda Staunton as the quintessentially evil Dolores Umbridge), even those with very miniscule roles. But they are the only thing holding this production together. Everything is very erratically designed, but nothing feels anywhere near as magical or as fantastical as those earlier films. It just lacks the genuine zest that has become accustomed to the Harry Potter films, and replaces it with a very dull sheet of blandness. Yes, this can be blamed on Rowling's flawed fifth book, but the last four films have had even their most boring pieces cleansed over into something that feels keenly tied to the fantasy elements of the books. Here, there is a more heightened sense of realism for the actors, and not much else. It feels devoid of any of the magic that made these films so popular in the first place. Pitch black darkness content-wise is nowhere near a viable excuse for poor film-making.With its problems, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix still pulls through as being heartbreakingly average. The story is still there, and the performances are some of the best to date, but I cannot help but feel that the magic is sorely missing from this instalment.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"At last, a Potter that stands head and shoulders above its origins","The above heading might be a bit misleading. it birth in books was no mean feat---Rowling clearly dipped into a pool of immeasurable imagination to spring seven consecutive stories upon us in a rather short time. But where the books have begun to fail, and where this film triumphs, is in INDEPENDENCE.Watch any of the previous films out of order and you'll be more vexed than Ron Weasley. They depend on one another to fully articulate their characters' situations and general characteristics. Plots spill over onto one another. non-fans were put off.That's where this little beauty wins out. Unlike the previous four, this one feels like a movie, rather than a well-made but verily similar segment of one long film. It has a beginning and end. Its feelings are worn on its sleeve. the acting has actually reached applaudible standards, especially with the younger cast (Daniel really has matured as an actor---though God knows Hermione could be a better-acted character. All that eager breathlessness makes my head hurt!).Fiennes too, excels at bringing magic to the show. Despite his relatively small part in a large (2hr 30min) story, he sticks in the mind as much as his character does within the confines of potter's brain. the ""background cast""---Snape, Dumbledore etc finally seem to do more than tell Harry what to do, they are part of the overall tapestry and instrumental in...nope, you have to see it.The plot itself exceeds the book's reach by cutting out unwanted and rather unnecessary fat. Gone are the endless expeditionary scenes and moments of Potter complaining and moping. The fans may not like it but us, the general audience, appreciate a film with bite and briskness, which this has in spades.As for the climax---it seems there was some last-minute editing. One can't help but wonder if the DVD will contain extra scenes of magic-war. This is no criticism, though. It is truly the best end to a Potter film yet, and without giving anything away, clearly hints at the chaos and truly dark proceedings that await in Film Six.Go see.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

Although the movie cut out some of the most important parts of the book, he made it even better adding great scenes that made the movie so good. Goldenburg, the screenwriter wanted to make it shorter because if he had put everything in the movie would end up being 3 to 3 and a half hours long. The sixth movie should be even better because Yates is directing this one as well and the original screenwriter Steve Kloves is coming back for this and hopefully the last movie as well. I have no problem with the screenwriter for the 5th movie but he cut out much and I love the 6th book so Im sure Kloves will do much better to put in all important scenes.

A low down,I was pretty much excited about this installments as by now I've become a fan of Harry Potter. The movie though didn't stand on my expectations. It has plot holes and things are left unexplained mostly. Rushing the things just offers us to wonder. People are saying that the book is lengthy and therefore they were not able to accommodate things properly in the short duration of movie. Nonetheless its still a good movie and you won't wanna miss it. Well no comments on vfx which is always appealing and a treat. So again its visually good and screenplay is good as well.

A great improvement on the book,"I was very pleased with this movie; in contrast to the other books, I found Order of the Phoenix as a book pretty dull and forgettable. But I felt the movie really brought it to life and narrowed it down into a much more succinct story. Some people would see this as a negative and others will think it is a positive.Emma Watson's acting, as previously mentioned, is a little forced, but at the same time it does suit the type of character she is playing, and overall it can be forgiven. I think the special effects used in the Department of Mysteries and the battle scene were fabulous, and the screenplay was excellent, particularly when you look at the screenplays from the first couple of films.I know I really enjoyed this film and it far exceeded my expectations.

"Reading this will save you time and money, stick to the books and save yourself from the disappointment","Firstly I would like to state that I am a huge fan of the books, as well as the films, even though some of the previous film installments could have been much better they were still enjoyable to watch. However in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, director David Yates and writer Michael Goldenberg took the deepest Harry Potter book and made an absolute mockery of it. It felt as if David Yates was terrified by how much story there was in Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix that he simply didn't know what to do with it. So, in order to compress this story into a mere 2 hour and 18 minutes, Yates cuts more story lines from the OotP than you can imagine and the ones he leaves are either constricted and rewritten or done with mini-montages adding to the lacking connection to the book. There are no transitions in this film whatsoever leaving no representation of time passing other than when Christmas comes. This also causes the viewer to feel as if they miss numerous parts of the movie as the scenes jump sporadically. With this film being so ridiculously short, the characters that we have grown accustomed to reading and seeing are barely visible throughout the film. This causes OotP to lack the ""Hogwarts"" feel that the other films possessed which allowed viewers to feel they were a part of what was happening on screen. Nearly all of the scenes that made this story relatable were cut, such as moments at Hogwarts and Hogsmeade. This takes the teenage amusement out of the story. It Prevents the trio from encountering their adolescent troubles with the absence of these scenes. Almost less amusing are the action scenes in this film. They are brief and left me yawning in my seat as it too strayed from the books. Though I would love nothing more to sit here and go into these matters further, this film has already wasted 2 hours and 20 minutes of my life and I wish to waste no more by writing about it. In short it felt like I was watching a hastily assembled Michael Bay film, but without any stylized action to keep me mildly entertained. This film was poorly constructed and had no finesse. Not only was this the worst installment of the Harry Potter film franchise, it was one of the most disappointing and despicable attempts at film-making I have ever seen.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Very very excellent movie,"A lot of people criticise this movie. Before I watched it I though I'll be disappointed but contrary was the case. Helena-Bonham Carter as Bellatrix was pretty fantastic, she did very good job. As well Evanna Lynch aka Luna Loved or Imelda Stunton aka Dolores Umbridge. But Jason Isaacs in the role of Lucius Malfoy will be for me the most fantastic person forever. You know I am deep-rooted fan of Jason/Lucius and I love him. I gotta say that he was the most handsome in The Order Of The Phoenix. My the most favorite scene was the one when Sirius says ""Get away from my godson!"" and punches Lucius (lol). Or when Harry says ""I've waited fourteen years"" and Lucius does the perfect sympathetic face and says ""I know"". If If I'd have to write my favorite scenes I would be here from dusk till dawn. As well Severus Snape is amazing. He is my second favorite character. But it's a shame he isn't in The Order Of The Phoenix more often. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are getting older but their performances are really good. By the way Voldemort was brilliant. I don't want to say that this movie is without mistakes. There are some. I think The Order Of The Phoenix is too short. I lack for Quidditch. Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy is really indispensable character. He is on the scene too little. Of course everyone confronts the movie with the book. Over these minute reservations, I want David Yates to shoot the 6th and the 7th part. Sorry for my English.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

The top-notch cast, with most of the best British actors and actresses, introduces the stunning Imelda Staunton in the role of a very nasty character and she is amazingly perfect. Contradictorily, the weakest name in these Harry Potter films is the hero and lead actor Daniel Radcliffe, but unfortunately there is no other way to handle the situation. The special effects are state of art and very impressive. My daughter is a big fan of Harry Potter, she reads all his books immediately after the release, and I imagine how difficult is to write an adaptation to the cinema of such number of pages. But for those like me that have not read the book, it works very well.

Fantastic!!!!,"The movie is fantastic, but it is way to short It's like only the high lights from the book is in this movie, and it lives me whit a empty feeling when it's over I know that almost 900 pages would make a very long film, but then again, what true Potter fan would mind a move that last 3 + hour ;o)When this is said I must say that this must be one of the best movies in the series so far, and the actors in kicking ass for real in this movieThe appearing of Evanna Lynch is a big plus for the movie, she is very good in the role of Luna Lovegood, I have read that she was pick from 15000 other girls applying for the role of Luna, I think they made the right choice in casting her.Daniel is giving his best preforms yet in this movie I thing, that boy is really a good actor.And we must not forget to complement Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley), she is also a big plus for this movie, not just Ron's little sister any more :o) And then as always there is Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) the again is perfect in there roles.I wrote 10 big bright stars for Harry Potter and the Order of the PhoenixNow go see this movie!!!!!!Best regardsFranck Ottossøn Denmark...",10.0,Anonymous,Action
*A Surreal Symphony of Shadows and Courage*,"In a cinematic journey where adolescence collides with the weight of destiny, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" emerges as a masterclass in storytelling-an intricate dance of darkness and resilience that captures the very essence of growing up against a backdrop of tumult and strife.This fifth installment in the revered franchise elevates the narrative to unprecedented heights, diving deep into the psyche of our beloved characters. Now more than ever, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) grapples with the isolation that comes with fame, the haunting specter of loss, and the chaotic ripple effects of his battle against Lord Voldemort. Radcliffe delivers a performance infused with raw emotion, reflecting Harry's internal turmoil as he navigates the treacherous waters of adolescence and his burdensome legacy.The film is a stunning tapestry woven with rich hues and striking contrasts, thanks to the expert direction of David Yates. Yates captures the bleakness of a world under siege, reflecting the darker themes of the story while ensuring that moments of hope-like the formation of Dumbledore's Army-shine through as brilliant beacons of light. The cinematography is a character in its own right, meticulously crafting a sense of urgency as the stakes rise and the shadows of the Wizarding World stretch ever longer.The introduction of Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) and Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) adds a layer of complexity to the narrative. Lynch embodies Luna's ethereal charm, bringing a breath of whimsicality to an otherwise suffocating environment, while Staunton's portrayal of Umbridge serves as a chilling reminder of the darker aspects of authority. The clash of their personalities with Harry and his friends only amplifies the film's central theme: the importance of unity and the resilience of friendship in the face of tyranny.Nicholas Hooper's score delivers an emotional punch that resonates long after the credits roll. It dramatically underscores the film's poignant moments, blending whimsy with an ominous undertone that echoes the looming threat of Voldemort's return. Each note encapsulates the nuanced choreography between light and dark, compassion and cruelty.""Order of the Phoenix"" is not merely a film; it is a profound exploration of sacrifice, identity, and the perils of ignorance. It challenges its audience to confront the uncomfortable truths of power, prejudice, and the importance of standing up for what is right-even when that means facing your greatest fears. This film is a humbling reminder that courage comes in many forms, and the battle for truth is often fought in the quiet moments of defiance.""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" encapsulates the saga's ability to evolve and reflect the complexities of both its characters and its audience. It is a poignant chapter that resonates deeply with anyone who has ever felt the weight of their world and the desire to rise above it. This film is not just a continuation of Harry's journey; it is a symphony for the soul, urging viewers to embrace their inner strength and wield it against the shadows that seek to consume them.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"What Was Done, Was Done Well, But HP5 Does Not Even BEGIN To Live Up To Its Potential!!","I wanted to love it. I have anticipated this movie for several years, now, but I have to say I was terribly disappointed by this installment of the blockbuster Harry Potter franchise. This was one rich novel, and one horribly chopped-up film! It's almost as if the director was handed a few sequences and told, ""Make a movie,"" and the remaining 2/3 of the book were left unattended.If you have no emotional investment in the franchise, and are simply a fan of the movies and not the novels, then this movie will be adequate in propelling the story into the next installment.If you ARE a fan of the books; however, you will discover that 3/4 of the work is left to the book! This work is nothing more than a shadow of its literary self.While the children are growing into fine young adults, and their performances are growing with them, the peripheral characters in this chapter are nothing better than lackluster, at best. As far as the kids go, I do have to interject that Dan Radcliffe has grown exponentially as an actor. He will have a brilliant career ahead of him, should he decide to follow this course. I can't wait to see where life leads him once the HP series is done and done. Emma's performances have grown over the years, as well. She seems more comfortable within her own skin, as Hermione, and Rup is growing up nicely. Dan, the world is your plum...just reach out and pluck it.Bonnie Wright just can't seem to get a handle on Ginny Weasley. Her weak portrayal seems to make Ginny's character more and more superfluous, installment by installment. If it weren't for the known storyline and her momentary importance therein, I would say the movies would be better without her. Her performances when she was younger, were more convincing and felt more real.Matthew Lewis is adequate as Neville. Frankly, I can't imagine anyone else who could portray the vacant look, wordless emoting, and complete lack of charisma any better than Matthew Lewis. If he didn't have at least SOME bearing on the outcome of Book 7, we don't seem to need his character, either. His character's presence and on screen time seem to be dwindling, rather than building; contrary to the books. Hopefully, if/when the time comes, he will be able to draw upon his experience as a child actor and enunciate around those prosthetic teeth! You can barely make out what he says! I'm also hoping he gets a grip on those bug eyes, and finds the ability to rise to the occasion, because in my opinion, he was much better an actor, when he was a younger boy. The ""actor"" he is now seems to be utterly out of place on the screen.Regrettably, Tom Felton had VERY little screen time, and I can't say I remember a single line, if he even had one. Evanna Lynch, on the other hand, had plenty of lines, lots of charm, and nailed Luna Lovegood's character quite well. Here's hoping she can keep up the pretense, long enough to finish out the necessity of her character.The Phelps twins got their shining moment, though not AS shining as one might expect due to the plethora of huge plot elements, etc. which were omitted, but it was adequate in its portrayal of the general feeling in Hogwarts at the time, though it did lack something, merely due to the writing, and in no way due to the twins themselves. They were awesome, as usual.I hope the next screenplay includes their presence, as the book did. Maggie Smith's screen time (as compared to her character's word time in the novel) was significantly less than what I felt it should have been. The best scene of the SERIES involving Minerva McGonagal was LEFT OUT/CUT! But okay. They ""had"" to do that due to screen time obligations and contractual stipulations. I know. I know.All in all, it was the hatchet job done on this work that brings it down in my opinion. Performance -wise, you'll get about what we've come to expect from most everyone but the trio who are improved, installment by installment. Otherwise, the enjoyment factor was lessened by a lack of continuity, and the adaptational quality was zilch.Inconceivably, this installment enjoys a box office gross second only to the initial installment! Just goes to show you how few people read, and how there's no accounting for taste. Read the book. You'll enjoy that immensely more than this film editor's wet dream.ALTHOUGH, what it DID show, it showed well.It rates a 5.5/10 from...the Fiend :.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
A Nutshell Review: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Finally, Harry Potter's gotten a decent clean cut hairstyle, compared to that ghastly shaggy dog manes that he spotted in the previous installment Goblet of Fire. The much touted scene here is The Kiss (about 1 hour into the movie), but seriously, that's much ado about nothing compared to what the rest of the movie has in store for audiences around the world. Just so you know, I've still not read any of the books by JK Rowling thus far, preferring to rely on cinematic magic to condense the ever increasing thickness of the novels into 2hrs and 10-20mins of full sensory invasion.As a movie franchise installment, it doesn't waste time introducing characters or what's been done - either you know it, or you don't. So for those who have not watched Goblet of Fire, then please do, as Order of the Phoenix starts off pretty much from where the previous left off, with Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) left haunted with his experience of battle with the dark Lord Voldermot (Ralph Fiennes, who also gained recent notoriety with his mile high exploits). Soon he finds himself devoid of friends, save for those loyal 2 - Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and plenty of pent up teenage angst of being unable to figure things out and make things right.Yes, Harry's all grown up now, and instead of the usual teenage dalliances, he gets troubled with the ways of the world, of school politics, ministry politics, an evil Lord after his blood, and many more just to make him break. Even the staunch fatherly figures of godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) and Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) seem so distant when he needed to reach out. Our boy wizard surely has his plate full.Without spoiling the plot, I thought the movies have already developed a formula in presentation, and its predictability comes in the form of starting with the Muggles, then a little scuffle, before proceeding to Hogwarts for the semester, uncover a certain mystery, get tangled into that mystery, where solving it leads to a major fight sequence, followed finally with some resolution, yet having a reminder loom around that while the micro stuff have been attended to, the macro issue of his parentage, his scar, his affiliation with Voldermot, are still not addressed in its entirety, and satisfactorily.Despite the structure, I've come to enjoy the franchised installments so far, as they play out like X-Files episodes - with mysteries that can be solved within the episode itself, yet having that long drawn conspiracy theories that continue to make you come back, just to learn whatever you can on new developments. As our characters grow (and actors grow in real world time), the story also develops and becomes more mature - gone are the cutesy antics in the earlier movies, and these get replaced by the darker themes, and in both mood and tone. Certain subplots do seem to get introduced quite haphazardly, but I suppose they're there as unmovable plot devices in order to stay true to the novel's actual plot development.The supporting cast continue to grow, and the introduction of Imelda Staunton's Folores Umbridge will indeed incense anyone - the quintessential teacher from Hell. Fans of Hermione and Ron will perhaps rue that their idols somehow get lesser screen time, and spend most times in the background. But I thought that each time when they get together and the scene is just on our 3 buddies, you just can't help but feel for the camaraderie so strongly forged, given that they've spent years and 5 movies together already. There's a scene where they smiled (yes it's that simple), but somehow, it rung through as being so genuine, so heartwarming in spite of the story's contextual doom and gloom, it's like a beacon of hope that no worries, everything will be alright. That simple scene alone won me, that this is indeed a movie with important themes on love and friendship, that in the face of adversary, you just know who to count on.Some may complain that the movie doesn't really feature much or new magic spells, but that I believe stays true to the storyline with many of Umbridge's unwarranted rules and regulations imposed on the student population. But when it's time to duke it out, I'd say the special effects were second to none, with the battles between the magic practitioners nothing less than spectacular, and since it's done by Industrial Light and Magic, then I'll state that they have been designed to be more intense that the Star Wars lightsabre fights - given of course we're dabbling in the realm of magic, where anything and everything goes, and to perfection as rendered in the movie - truly an awesome sight to behold when the masters settle it mano a mano.I think this is the best Harry Potter movie so far (I've made mention that Goblet of Fire was, back in late 2005), even though it's still a cock tease. Guess we've got 10 days to find out what will really happen to the boy wizard, and thereafter, stay interested enough to want to watch the remaining two movies. I'd like to say that I can't wait (to read about the ending in Deathly Hallows, and for the last 2 movies to be made).",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Don't set your hopes too high,"Let me preface this by saying that I've never read any of the books.I thought that this film lacked a storyline, spent far too much time on a new character, and scratched the surface on a main character's past (but didn't go deep enough). I also thought that the media over-hyped the movie's 'darkness.' A final criticism is that the charades played near the start of the film could have been done much quicker and set up the storyline just the same. The biggest positive is that you learn a little about one of the main characters and by the end of the film you feel like Harry's character has gone through some progression. It wasn't a bad movie, but walking out of the theater I don't feel like the story had advanced much from the point where the 'Goblet of Fire' movie left off.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
"An improvement on Goblet of Fire, but still not perfect!","My most obvious flaw was that at the beginning, the actors looked as though they had been computerised, and I personally found that very distracting, with the scene with the dementors, it just seems strangely executed. Another flaw is that I am still not a huge fan of Michael Gambon's Dumbledore. He isn't a bad actor, but he doesn't quite fit the bill of Dumbledore, and there were some scenes with him that seemed rather strange. However, putting the flaws aside, we do have a lovely-looking film, with very good special effects, and excellent cinematography. As for the acting, I was impressed. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are still likable, as is Robbie Coltrane. Alan Rickman is very suave and dour as Snape, but the acting honours do go to Imelda Staunton as Umbridge. I have read the book, and do prefer it, as there was a lot missed out in the film. My favourite scene was the Department of Mysteries scene, because some of that was creepy, with Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix. No one could have done that better. All in all, a lovely looking film, with some flaws in the first half. 8/10 Bethany Cox.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Daniel Radcliffe finally grows into the role of Harry Potter and gives the performance of his career.  Yates is the best director the series has had.,"There is no doubt that Harry Potter is an iconic character of a generation, and it would be very easy for filmmakers to go 'typical Hollywood' on the film adaptations and coast through for the sake of money. It is remarkable, however, to witness the awesome dedication from people such as David Heyman, David Barron, David Yates, and especially the young Daniel Radcliffe. The crew of these films work so hard to preserve the magic and brilliance of JK Rowling's novels, and it really shows on screen in the brilliant performances, beautiful sets, and masterful direction.Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is growing up fast, and now he must deal with enemies both inside and outside the walls of Hogwarts. Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) return is being ignored by the Ministry of Magic, and the Ministry's distrust of Headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) is most evident when a high ranking official (Imelda Staunton) is placed in Hogwarts as a teacher. Add on that Harry's feelings of alienation and loneliness may get the best of him, and you realize that the wizarding world is taking on a dark tone, and that things may no longer be safe for our heroes.David Yates has, in my opinion, crafted the finest directorial job of any of the films, finishing just ahead of Alfonso Cuaron's brilliant take on 'Prisoner of Azkaban'. What I like most about Yates is his uncanny ability to retain the spirit of the novel (which is the longest of all), while making a movie that is, not only the shortest, but the only one that doesn't drag, despite the decreased amount of action in comparison to its predecessor, 'Goblet of Fire'. Yates' biggest strength is in his ability to procure good performances across the board, as this is the most well acted out of all the Potter films. Daniel Radcliffe gives the best performance of the series thus far with his great take on a conflicted, vulnerable, and emotionally fragile Harry Potter. It is at this point that we see Harry transition from young boy to young adult. Harry is growing up, just like Radcliffe, who almost effortlessly expresses that. Kudos must always go to Mr. Alan Rickman for giving probably the most loyal and spot on performance as Severus Snape, the scene stealing Potions master. Even in reduced screen time, Rickman gives another award worthy performance. Special mention must also be made for Imelda Staunton and Ralph Fiennes, who are positively scary in their roles as Dolores Umbridge and Lord Voldemort, respectively. Fiennes could have used more screen time, however you can definitely feel the tension between him and Radcliffe as hero and villain despite the lack of screen time. Helena Bonham Carter steals the show in a brief role as Voldemort's most sadistic and loyal follower Bellatrix Lestrange. The most surprising has to be the fine performance from newcomer Evanna Lynch as dreamy and 'out there' student Luna Lovegood. She is simply wonderful as the character, and it should come as no surprise that the character is her favorite. I also feel the need to applaud Gary Oldman for his wonderful portrayal of Sirius Black, a fan favorite. He provides both the fatherly warmth and the brotherly charm given off by Sirius in the novels very well. Also reprising their roles well are Maggie Smith, Mark Williams, David Thewlis, Jason Isaacs, and Julie Walters.As with any big budget production, the Harry Potter films always boast outstanding special effects and production design. I believe one of the biggest Oscar snubs in 2007 was not giving Stuart Craig a nomination for his brilliant sets, especially Umbridge's office, the Ministry of Magic, the Department of Mysteries, and the Room of Requirement. The sets are beautiful, and are one of the main reasons it's so easy to escape into the magical wizarding world. The special effects, usually a strong point of the Potter films, take a turn for the worse in some scenes, while in others, they are brilliant. This is the fact that the film's post production is rushed showing itself. The centaurs and the giant Grawp (Tony Maudsley) are the weakest point of the visuals, while all the special effects such as magic spells, fireworks, and the climactic Ministry of Magic battle, are simply brilliantly done. Michael Goldenberg's script is good, but there are some flaws and continuity errors, but for the most part it sets the stage for a great adaptation. There are also some editing flaws, but it doesn't really detract from the story. Order of the Phoenix also has the distinction of straying the furthest from the plot, cutting subplots and slightly changing the roles of Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis, who is also great) and Cho Chang (Katie Leung...not so much).All in all, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix can stand alone as a decent political/mystery thriller, that serves as a bridge between the novels from child's play to the supreme darkness that is come in the final 2 installments (however, the final chapter in the story, Deathly Hallows, will be 2 films). It is a great movie that the fans will love a lot more than the critics think. For sure, 'Order' gets better every time you watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
I-MAXimum Loved it!,"Yes, after reading all The HP Books 2 or more times, I found much to love in this ""Illustration"" of the ""Order of the Phoenix"". Our Cast has developed as have their characters - From a Darker, Moodier, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, to a Rule Breaking Emma Watson as Hermione. Maggie Smith as the uptight McGonagall now turns some of her Ire Against an Authority figure (Umbridge)!I wanted MORE of Everything, except maybe more Screen. I plan to go back and see this at least one more time on a big FLAT Screen. The IMAX was great for large Outdoor shots, but distorted Indoor scenes too much. I'm sure I'll have to get the DVD when it's out. I hope it has at least a half hour worth of Deleted Scenes. The Pirates - At World's End had 168 minutes of runtime, and OotP with 138 left a Lot more story untold!I wanted MORE of the New Characters - Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood is truly a Lovable Hit! Please give her MORE Screen Time and Dialogue! Natalia Tena as Nymphodora Tonks was also great to watch, but don't expect to understand her Shape-Shifting Facial Contortions if you didn't read the book! Helena Bonham Carter's portrayal of Bellatrix Lestrange was predictably evil, as those who saw her in ""Fight Club"" would know she could. Maybe it's hard to mention Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge, because it's so easy to Hate the Character from her first appearance in the Trial.I really missed a lot of scenes from the book, like St Mungo's, where we should have been introduced to Neville Longbottom's parents in a more graphic way. The Battles were Graphic, but not at all as Detailed as I had imagined, like all scenes from the Ministry of Magic. So even if you saw the Movie FIRST, you Still MUST Read the Book to get it All.I just got out of the IMAX Theatre less than an hour ago. It's amazing how much of this plot could be compacted in to 2 hours of screen time - and still leave me wanting MORE MORE MORE!",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"Finally, an HP film worthy of the name","While 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix' isn't quite the epic that fans of the books had hoped the HP films would grow to be, it is a worthy film and joins 'Prisoner of Azkaban' as the most redeeming of the film series. OotP sees Harry, now aged fifteen and more a man than a child, entering his Fifth Year at Hogwarts. Although Ron and Hermione continue to provide unyielding friendship and support, our hero is bitter and jaded in the aftermath of Cedric Diggory's death and questions his role in bringing down destiny. In addition to his burdens, he also has to deal with the new harsh, unsympathetic DADA teacher Umbridge, appointed by the Ministry and determined to discredit Harry's claim that darkness stalks the wizarding world once more, and Voldemort plundering his mind through telepathic (leglimency, for fans) means.As per usual, the adult cast of the film are exemplary and I think we expect no less from these British veterans. Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon and Robbie Coltrane all succeed wonderfully in bringing their characters to life, despite the fact they still don't appear in enough scenes. Gary Oldman, as Black, and Remus Lupin, as Lupin, are both back again and continue to perform their roles well. Imelda Staunton was absolutely excellent as Umbridge, depicting the character as almost a manic mix of a smug Margaret Thatcher, a deranged Hyacinth Bucket and as obsessed with Minister of Magic as Anne Wilkes was of her favourite author in 'Misery'! In regards to the younger cast, Daniel Radcliffe continues to grow in his role. He still struggles a bit with Harry's darker emotions (in part, I believe, down to the fact that Radcliffe is more natural at comedy) but he is able to maintain the character's moodiness without making a mess. Emma Watson, unfortunately, remains in the 'over-acting' mode that left her performance in 'Goblet of Fire' so irritating. Someone needs to tell the girl to relax if she is to ever achieve a more natural performance. Rupert Grint definitely shines out. His laid-back, quiet nature works well in portraying Ron's loyalty to Harry and his determination to be there for his friends and family. New to the cast is Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood, who depicted the character's dreamy, head-in-the-clouds manner to a T. Of the young cast, she is the one who most accurately brings her character to life.Michael Goldenberg, the scriptwriter who steps in Steve Kloves' shoes in the first change to the scriptwriting role since PS, does an excellent job and I wish he could have stayed on for 'Half-Blood Prince'. He quite rightly focused the film primarily on the lead character, rather than the trio as a team, since OotP is very much Harry's story where he feels alone in the world as he struggles to accept his destiny. I have a feeling Kloves, who very obviously favours Hermione, wouldn't have been able to achieve this in his zeal to give his favourite screen-time.Goldenberg also provides mature dialogue, that reflects on the characters' British-ness, and scenes that allow the viewers to both empathise and feel exasperated with Harry's moods (he cut down the number of tantrums Harry has, which works better in order to retain sympathy for the character). He's also toned down the selfishness of Sirius Black compared to the book and the depth of hatred between Snape and Harry/the Marauders. In a way, I think this does work better for the film otherwise-- without access to Harry's thoughts-- we'd be left wondering why he even bothers himself with Black.Also new to the production team is David Yates, as the director, and what a welcome change he is. Yates, whose previous projects are British television dramas, is not so entrenched in Hollywood and this is what these films desperately needed to give them a bit of class expected from a British franchise. Too much dumbing down and pandering to small children and the shallow masses, in an attempt to turn these films into popcorn blockbusters, are what have prevented them from becoming as great as they could have been.I did think the film should have ended on the darker note of the book instead of trying to deliver hope when Harry was feeling no such thing. In the book, after everything he'd been through, Harry was shown to be at his lowest ebb and this depression to his character wasn't retained in the film. I also felt a certain someone's death could have been better reflected on; I don't think Harry's grief, shock, anger and despair was properly portrayed. I also didn't like the light-hearted music during the scenes where Umbridge is taking firm control of the school. Her actions are meant to cruel and constricting, not humorous.Overall, I think OotP provides hope for the HP films yet (a series that will have to carry the burden of continuing the hype since the final book is released on 21/07/07, meaning the interest in the franchise could wane if things aren't done properly). For the first time, I came out quite satisfied that nothing too essential had been missed out nor had characters been greatly mis-handled. The only reason I still favour PoA is because it focused more on the adult characters, who I prefer. Nevertheless, OotP is an enjoyable film that shows that HP isn't for children anymore (please don't bring your toddler to this as they will either end up bored or traumatised) and this has to be reflected in the tone of the script, the depiction of the characters and in the performances of the young cast. Sadly, with Kloves back in the seat for HBP, it's hard to know whether this vein with be maintained (especially since he might not be able to resist the temptation of focusing on the romance and Hermione scenes to the detriment of the actual plot).",,Anonymous,Action
Darker and Darker,"After the encounter with Voldemort at The Triwizard Tournament, opinions are divided on Harry Potter. Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge is determine to squash the news of Voldemort's return, and demonize Potter and Dumbledore. The world is coming down on Potter.

Torturing the students is really a new level of darkness in this series. There is a real sense of evil in this one more than the others.

Haters: It can't include everything!!!,"Granted... as someone who has read all the books countless times and listened to Jim Dale audiobooks too. I would have loved the movie to have everything that's in the book.... BUT that would have been a 12 to 15 hour movie and STILL not cover the fine points.I think Yates and Goldenberg did a good job to cram it into 2:35. Yes, there were deviations from the book, to condense the scenes, to leave out unnecessary plot digressions, and add some action and imagination.You must realize that the purpose of the movie is NOT to make book fans happy it is and always will be TO MAKE MONEY. Without this motivation there wouldn't be a movie in the first place. Plus, they need to take the audience into consideration, making Grawp passive bothered me, but it would appeal better to the 8 year old, I saw in the theater.Finally, if other items deviated from the book, i.e. Mr. Weasly not having wacky clothing on, it's probably because NON-Readers of the book, wouldn't understand and explaining it would waste time that could be used for more important plot points.If you REALLY want to know how hard a job Goldenberg had try writing a Readers Digest version of the OOTP in 50 pages. I guarantee it will disappoint far more than this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

Harry's hair....a bit disappointing but the movie made up for that. Kreacher was Amazing. He looked exactly like I had pictured him. Even comparing it to the book is possible. It beats the rest of the films by a long shot. I LOVED the Harry Cho kissing scene and the look and film of the characters and their surroundings gave me shivers.

My Least Favorite HP Book Was Loads Better than the Movie.,"This Harry Potter movie was way too different from the other HP movies. I'm not sure who is the person that is the most to blame for this. It could be the director David Yates, who has never directed anything else that is recognizable. It could be the screenplaywright Michael Goldenberg, who is filling in for Steve Kloves, who is leaving this HP episode as the only one he's not screen writing. Or maybe J.K. Rowling herself, for writing books that are so varied in length, and for forcing the makers of the movies based on longer books to compress stuff and cut important stuff out.One of my biggest complaints is that the shortest Harry Potter book turned out a movie that was still quite long. The second book was a bit longer, and the movie was a bit longer too. The third book was significantly longer, but the movie was significantly shorter. The fourth book was a lot longer, and the movie was only a bit longer. The fifth book is the longest of all, and the movie is the shortest of all. The first two movies, I predict, will always be my favorite two.The third movie was the first time I was disappointed in a Potter movie, although I liked it a bit more the more I watched it. It had only one Quidditch match, the one in which Gryffindor loses, while both the other two in the book, in which Gryffindor wins, one of which is the Quidditch Final, were deleted. And it didn't mention the true identities of Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs, which irked me.I heard long before the fourth movie was released that it would be two movies, which would have been good and also logical. But then I heard it would be a regular-length, single movie. The first nine chapters were covered in about ten minutes. There was no Quidditch in this one, but that was okay, because in the book, the Quidditch tournament was canceled for the Triwizard Tournament.And now we have the fifth movie. The beginning was good. NO QUIDDITCH! although it's there in the book. Irked. Here's Dolores Umbridge, who is a downright, love-to-hate, bad witch. I hated her a lot more in the book, probably mainly because she bans Harry from a lifetime of Quidditch after a match. The fact that Ron and Hermione were prefects was not mentioned at all. Confused. A lot of the events were out of order, which was one thing that bothered me in the third movie, which I eventually mostly got over. I imagined being completely lost if I hadn't read the book. The plot, especially the climax, is significantly darker, but the movie is maybe a bit too dark, in maybe more disturbing a way than the book. The story, from beginning to end, was okay and a little bit redeeming, although it wasn't as enjoyable as the plots in the other books. The acting was good and okay, better than that in the fourth movie. Gary Oldman, who is a good actor, who plays Sirius Black, who didn't show up until the end of the third movie, who was only seen as ashes in a telefire and a voice narrating a letter in the fourth, was likable and an impressive actor in the fifth. Evanna Lynch, who is introduced as Luna Lovegood, was better than I imagined her in the book, although she didn't get to do everything she did in the book. Helena Bonham Carter was good as Bellatrix Lestrange, and whenever she appeared, it looked like a Tim Burton movie, which I'll say is a good thing.The end credits didn't seem to fit. They looked like circus ad text.Bring back John Williams! Nicholas Hooper was okay, and kind of kept the Harry Potter feel, but there was a moment in the end credits that screamed electric guitar, which wasn't pleasing to the ear.It for a moment made me want to beg for a remake. But who knows how that would be possible? I only hope that I'll like this any more the more I watch it, like I did for the third.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Nothing impressive,"yes its another harry potter film but it brings nothing new from the last one really (past storyline advancement) and with the exception of the 10 minute climactic fight at the end, you can literally sleep through the movie.This film was the weakest out of all in the series thus far. Not for lack of acting or special effects, but everything else.Wish we would've seen more of Tonks thats for sure and while the movie does have a few moments of laughter, they're too few, instead choosing to bore its viewers with dialogue that really didn't lead anywhere interesting.Its an okay movie, definitely good enough to watch, but brings nothing new and everything, even if you haven't read the books, is very predictable.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Lost its magic?.... nah i don't think so!,"An entertaining movie from the start, the acting from Daniel Radcliffe this time was much better than the other movies, You can see & feel that Harry has matured more & not only is he dealing with people not believing Vol... (He who must not be named) is back but also trying for the affections of a certain Ravenclaw.Imelda Staunton is great as Umbridge, down to the little ""hmphf"" of hers. The scene where she slaps Harry! Ouch!Ron, Hermione, Neville, etc are fine (Luna is great!) but wished there were more development on the teachers & other adult characters (Order of the Phoenix).The Visual Effects were pretty impressive & the Ministry of magic was what i imagined it would look like from reading the book. The end battle was good but you wanted it to last for ages!Some people are saying that the movie has lost its magic & wonder. We have been in the Harry potter world now for the last 4 Movies & 7 books & I think the magic is still there but its not taking centre stage this time. We know of the Wizards, Witches, brooms, Spell books, Giants, Owls, Wands, etc & this time its shown as things they use & cope with in their normal lives (for Potter universe that is). Feels like its making it a bit more real.All in all its a fun entertaining movie, good sequel, with a lot of wonder & some of its magic too!",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Disappointed and not what I had hoped .,"This movie was not what I had expected, yes , the special effects were good. But i believe that the movie had lacked a proper backbone , because , I , being a BIG Harry Potter fan and have read the books, have come to believe that the audience that has not read the book may not have fully understand this movie entirely. The movie , I believe seemed to be a bit rushed because the plot that was created seemed to end very quickly, hence back to when I had said the movie was rushed.The acting and special effects was superb but they were only there to satisfy the audience that has not read the book, the audience that has read the book i believe was kind of in disbelief.Therefore I sincerely hope that the producers of the Harry Potter movies put more meaning into the next Harry Potter movies, not just special effects to take over our senses.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Fantastic,"Usually, if a film series ever reaches a fifth installment, the franchise has long shown strain and popular interest is long gone. 'The Order of The Phoenix' is something of a miracle in several respects. It shows great imagination and no sign of fatigue or lack of ideas despite it being the fourth sequel. This is due almost exclusively to the novel's author. It also offers the audience a delicious peak into the minds of a radically talented writer and director.A new man behind the camera, and a new man writing the words together tackle a labyrinthine story which is widely considered the most polar of the Potter novels. Some felt it was rich with amazing detail that peered into the young adolescent lives of its heroes. Others felt it was superfluous for the sake of being superfluous. One way or another, David Yates has created one fantastic film! Michael Goldenberg's script has somehow found a way to string together everything that makes the novel so terrific, while also weaving through the multiple bulky elements. He managed to explore certain characters and revelations while dealing with the constructs of film time limits. He condenses story elements wonderfully, but does so in a way that would please even the most die had of Potter fans. This is an Oscar caliber piece of writing.Director David Yates also brings the best out of the actors, and gleefully dances through what should have been the most difficult film in the series so far. He makes it look easy. Consider the first shot in the film. The camera is perched high above an English suburb on the hottest of summer days. Young Harry Potter sits on an eerily staged swing set and a voice over the radio gives some small detail without too much information. Deep isolation rests in his eyes. We know he is a wizard. We know he can do great things. However, he is stuck in a scene from a David Gordon Green movie. This tells us early on that it won't all be about magic and wonderment, but also this character who is still essentially a kid.Another scene featuring Arthur Weasley, demonstrates Yates' pure enjoyment with his material. Arthur is escorting Harry to The Ministry of Magic using the London underground. He gleefully steps off the escalator and with wide eyes; he enjoys everyone casually traveling to work. Nothing is said in the scene, but its message of character could not be more clear: he is in love with his surroundings. In Chris Columbus's hands there surly should have been a fake sounding monologue, but Yates assumes his audience is smarter than that.New cast members also help bring about the very best from the story. Academy Award nominee Imelda Staunton is so perfect as Dolores Umbridge that it is nearly distracting, and Evanna Lynch gets many of the film's laughs as the ecstatically spacey Luna Lovegood. It's still Radcliff's show as Harry, and for the first time in the series he truly commands the screen, depending less on his wonderful supporting cast.It's true the film is darker and less focused on the magical aspects in Harry's life, but at the same time it perfectly shows his desperation and the uncertainty of some very troubled times. You could say this is an allegory for our world, but that would be cheap. The fans of Harry are growing and so is he. The films in tern are also becoming more adult. There are no longer any of the ""gee, I'm a wizard"" moments, but now they are starting to realize that it will get a whole lot darker before it becomes bright.The film never snags along the way, and when it concludes 2 hours and 20 minutes after it started, you get the feeling you have seen something great. Too much more, and the film would have been overlong. Removing any more, and it wouldn't have captured the essence of the work. The film finds its rut in a wonderful place of cinema heaven where talent is beaming ever so bright. No longer can the fans have word for word translations into film, but instead they will have to appreciate well planned and constructed movies, this may please adults more than children. 'The Order of the Phoenix' is truly a wonder of film-making, and represents what would be the best Potter film by far, had it not been for Alfonso Cuaron's 'The Prisoner of Azkaban.'",,Anonymous,Action
Front and Center for Dumbledore's Army.,"Term 5 at Hogwarts for Harry and the gang and it's a deeply unsettling time. Harry faces getting expelled and finds himself shunned by many around him. This at a time when the Ministry of Magic compounds his misery by insisting to all and sundry that ""you know who"" is not back again.Given that JK Rowling's fifth book is considered to be something of a door stopper, a book more of interim Potter filler than any great amount of substance, credit has to go to new to the franchise director, David Yates. For Yates and his screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have managed to craft a briskly entertaining segment in under 2 hours and 20 minutes of film. Yes it's safe to say that it ultimately does feel like an interim filler movie, one that is for fans and not newcomers to the series, but the effects are superb (except Grawp that is), the action is much and suspense is not in short supply. While it also finds Radcliffe as Potter finally hitting his acting stride.New into the magical fray comes the wonderful Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbrage, the sort of cheery psychotic teacher we all had bad dreams about in our formative years. Also most welcome is Helena Bonham Carter as nut job harpy Bellatrix Le Strange, it's an appetiser of substance and we can't wait to see some more of her from here on in. Of course the usual problem of not enough screen time for the regulars still exists, but it's now become a figure of grumpy acceptance in the grand scheme of Potter World. Neatly keeping the story trimmed of extraneous fat, Yates doesn't disappoint in delivering a last quarter as memorable as any so far in the series. Big rewards await those who wait, because the showdown that crowns Order of Phoenix is a magical mêlée of wands and wonderment; a face off between good and evil, a free for all that joyously assaults the senses.Roll on Half-Blood Prince, where it's great to know that Yates has been further entrusted with the Harry Potter reins. 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Action

Cant help but compare it to the book,"If you are going to base films on books you have to be prepared for comparisons!!! Phoenix is my favourite of the Harry Potter books books but I must admit that this movie is my least favourite.If you are able to judge it as a stand alone film then its not bad but too much was missed out to make it a convincing adaptation of the 5th novel.Put it this way it was the first movie of the summer that I couldn't wait for it to end.There are good performances from the usual cast and the characters of umbridge and bellatrix were perfectly cast, dan radcliffe is getting better with age and will probably go on to be a huge star once the potter films are finished.Oh well will have to wait and see what they do with half blood prince which is more complex than this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Amazing entry and very important movie to the franchise,"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" was directed by David Yates and is the fifth instalment in the Harry Potter franchise. This movie shows how much Harry has grown, as he and his friends have to stand up against authorities that try to takeover Hogwarts.After the launch of this movie, Yates was chosen to direct the other three Harry Potter movies and the newer Fantastic Beasts films. This was a great decision, as ""Order of the Phoenix"" is exactly the movie it had to be. After the gritty ending of ""Goblet of Fire"", Harry Potter nearly being expelled in the beginning of this entry and Umbridge taking control of Hogwarts things are looking really bad. Therefore, Harry and his friends form an army to defend themselves against both Umbridge and the Dark Lord.This movie features great writing and acting and amazing direction and cinematography especially in the finale which features the first big battle between ""Dumbledore's Army"" and the worshipper of the Dark Lord.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Steady start for Yates as he takes Order of the franchise.,"David Yates may not be able to rekindle the excellent form shown in movies two, three and four however his first of four Potter films he directs is a fine entry into the collection - even if it is a little disappointing.When Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) tries to assist Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) in convincing the Ministry of Magic that Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) has returned from the grave. However, their accusations are ignored by the people at the helm of the Ministry and they send their recruit Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) to restore order to Hogwarts and to take over as Dark Arts teacher. Umbridge is an old fashioned, no nonsense character who is extremely harsh with her punishments for the smallest of incidents. Meanwhile, Harry begins to fall for female wizard Cho Chang (Katie Leung) and suffer mood swings as Voldermort begins to control Harry's subconscious.The plot and narrative feels a little empty and under-cooked with only a portion of the book making the big screen. Strangely, a duration of 138 minutes makes it the shortest of the first five Potter films; this is strange because the book consist of over 1,000 pages, the longest of the collection. It seems to make little sense that the book which has the most entailed in it is the shortest of the first five films and clearly the one which is most flawed in terms of story line.On a positive note, the cast of Radcliffe and co. is once more great with the maturity and realism of the upcoming actors/actresses growing by each movie.Also, the 'Order of the Phoenix' is another thoroughly entertaining and at times creepy fifth film of the eight. It's thoroughly entertaining for its rapid pace, but mostly for the way it climaxes; a stupendous display of CGI and powerful acting resulted in a superior ending to any of witnessed in the previous four films.Solid foundations for Yates, but foundations which he certainly builds upon in his later Potter adaptions'.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix: A Riveting Tale of Courage and Loss,"*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* delves deep into the heart of the wizarding world, capturing the essence of friendship, bravery, and the devastating sting of loss. The film, directed by David Yates, masterfully adapts J. K. Rowling's fifth installment, bringing to life the intricate plotlines and emotional turmoil of its beloved characters.The movie begins with a chilling attack on Harry and Dudley by Dementors, setting the tone for the darker, more mature themes that run throughout the film. Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry Potter continues to evolve, showing the character's resilience and determination in the face of adversity. The film skillfully explores Harry's isolation and frustration as he battles not only the sinister forces of Lord Voldemort but also the ignorance and bureaucracy of the Ministry of Magic.The introduction of Dolores Umbridge, played with chilling precision by Imelda Staunton, adds a new layer of tension to the story. Her oppressive presence and refusal to teach practical defense spells drive Harry and his friends to form Dumbledore's Army, a secret group that symbolizes the strength of unity against tyranny. The camaraderie among the students, especially the trio of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, shines brightly even in the darkest moments.One of the film's most poignant aspects is Harry's struggle to come to terms with his connection to Voldemort. This internal battle is beautifully portrayed, highlighting Harry's vulnerability and his deep-seated fear of losing his loved ones. The revelation of Snape's past and the emotional impact it has on Harry adds a layer of complexity to the characters, making them feel more real and relatable.The climactic battle at the Department of Mysteries is a visual spectacle, filled with breathtaking wizardry and heart-pounding action. The loss of Sirius Black, brilliantly portrayed by Gary Oldman, is a gut-wrenching moment that leaves a lasting impact. Oldman's performance captures Sirius's warmth and bravery, making his demise all the more heartbreaking.Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort and Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore deliver powerful performances in their epic duel, showcasing the battle between good and evil at its peak. The special effects and choreography of the fight scenes are nothing short of spectacular, immersing the audience in the wizarding world's magical prowess.*Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix* is a triumph in storytelling, seamlessly blending elements of fantasy, adventure, and drama. It explores themes of loyalty, sacrifice, and the enduring power of friendship, leaving the audience captivated until the very end. As the series takes a darker turn, this installment sets the stage for the epic battle between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort, ensuring that fans eagerly anticipate the saga's next chapter.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
The Worst Harry Potter,I think the outcome of the Order of the Phoenix was poor and i didn't really enjoy the film. I thought the storyline was boring and i think they have lost ideas. I really hate Dolorus Umbridge she makes my skin crawl. In the other films there was an interesting plot but this one didn't engage me. Although it's the worst Harry Potter movie i still don't think it's a bad movie because some parts were entertaining and funny for example the introduction of Luna Lovegood. I also enjoyed the ending of the film i thought it was very dark. It's good to see all the characters grown up and matured. It is propably the most underatted one and of the most hated ones.,7.0,Anonymous,Action

Meanwhile , Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) , Minister for Magic, suspects that Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon) is using these claims of The Dark Lord's return as a means to over-throw Fudge as Minister . And a recent stiff-upper-lipped teacher called Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), implies new teachings and rules . Here some legendary events take place , and Harry Potter /Daniel Radcliffe competes in confronting in series of dangerous happenings , challenging monsters , Dementors , sinister enemies (Jason Isaac , Tom Felton , Helen Bonham Carter) , and horrible creatures and an ending spooky climatic battle .

In spite of overlong runtime, it suffers from over-length, and the difficult of adapting, the film still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamiliar with the literary and highly detailed work by J. K. Rowling.This overlong motion picture was splendidly filmed with sensational production design and colorful cinematography by Slawomir Idziak . As well as rousing and spectacular music by Nicolas Hooper . The movie is magnificently directed by David Yates but adding excessive digital visuals and large 3D computer effects . As filmmaker David yates counteracts the long running time with a consistent pace and attractive set pieces This British director is a expert on fantasy/action /adventure movies as proved in Harry Potter saga, as he made various entries : Harry Potter and the order of Phoenix, Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and Part and a notable Tarzan movie (2016) . Davied Yates went on shooting fantasy movies set seventy years before Harry Potter arrives in the marvellous school Hogwarts , such as : Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (2016) and Fantastic Beasts : The Crimes of Grindelwald (2018) . The film is for Harry Potter saga lovers as well as neophyte who have never read J. K. Rowling novels . Well worth watching. The flick will appeal to Harry Potter saga followers.

"The worst book, but the best film","I have read and enjoyed each of the Harry Potter books, although I have only read them once each. Reading other's comments, it appears that I am in the minority in that I found that the Order of the Phoenix contained the most redundancy. For me, the first 200 pages and the last 200 pages were up to the usual standard, but the middle section (and a hefty section at that, being over 400 pages) felt an awful lot like filler.I am pleased to say that the film has been made in such a way that a lot of that filler has been condensed into concise snippets, which assist the story without taking up an inordinate amount of time. My only word of caution would be that, although I haven't read the book since it was released, I still knew enough about it that the story didn't lose me. I would have to speak to someone who has seen the film but not read the book to confirm whether this would be the case for those who haven't read it.Certainly, the pacing of this film seems perfect, with an excellent balance struck between drama, action, storyline and comic relief. Although the film is over two hours, it really never dragged and I hope is a sign of things to come with the film adaptations.As far as performances go, the adult cast is as good as always, with particular standouts being Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix LeStrange and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black.As for the principals, they have all noticeably improved, with the biggest difference being Ron Weasley. I was finding the portrayal of him to be increasingly irritating, with his range of acting seemingly restricted to face-pulling. However, I am happy to say that in the OotP, he is nicely understated and as a result, the humour when it does arrive is genuinely amusing.The sets and effects are very well done.The ministry of magic is much more imposing than I had imagined, but does work very well and nicely portrays a busy working environment, albeit with a magical twist.Grimwald Place is presented well and although it doesn't figure as much in the film as in the book, it feels that it is now shown only when necessary (one of the many things I felt caused the dragging of the story in the book).Hogwarts is as good as ever, with the Room of Requirement being particularly well designed. In fact, all the scenes in the Room of Requirement are very well played and again, the pacing means that there is not too much and not too little.Finally, the effects are very well put together, with obvious highlights being the duelling. It really does feel like old-fashioned duelling, but with magic.All in all, I throughly enjoyed the film and it far exceeded my expectations. My wife and I were still talking about it the next day and to me, that proves what an impact it had on us.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
All in order,"I recently enjoyed ""The Order of the Phoenix"" while watching through all the Harry Potter films without having read the originating books. In a sense, it seems that it might be called ""Harry Potter does political thriller,"" and, as it turns out, Harry Potter does a pretty good political thriller. It means that the intriguing and vast fictional world that these take place in is sufficiently developed that its characters and situations can theoretically be dropped into all kinds of different story and the associated references can be assumed to be understood.From the outset, and in keeping with plot developments concerning he return of the evil wizard Voldemort, this film is grim an bleak to a degree that its predecessors were not. This dire atmosphere, while not lending itself to the exuberance of the previous films, is evocative in a story involving so much back-room intrigue as the agent of danger and which explores its principles by dwelling so on past pains, especially in Harry Potter's case.There is a good amount of mainly non-specific political allegory here, in the form on 1984-style manipulation of Harry's school by the reality-denying forces of the Ministry of Magic, and this is all very cleverly done, with rather darkly-humorous developments coming in the form of countless draconian announcements posted on the school's walls. This satirical political theme pairs well with the strain of discourse around Harry's doubt for his own goodness and the message that nobody is ever fully bad -- love and kindness being what redeems him from being like Voldemort. This shows a moral development of the very viewpoint of the series as a whole. Luna Lovegood is a charmingly eccentric new character, blithely unmindful of how she is denigrated by her fellows. Dolores Umbridge treads close to the line of over-the-top caricature but something in the performance brings the unsettlingness of her sweetness-and-light delivery of totalitarianism well.This film is technically and in all aspects of production as good as its predecessors and the writing too is more subtle and as good if not better. However, in this new grimness it seems that there has been some loss of the sense of fun and wonder that permeated the earlier Harry Potters, making this no less a good movie but a somewhat less joyful one.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
As a Harry Potter Skeptic.. Best movie of the series,"I grew up in the hype of HP but only ever watched 1-3 and eventually the last three movies as they came out. I enjoyed the first ones for the nostalgia but never sat down and filled in the gaps. I started rewatching all of the movies and after suffering through the goblet of fire this movie was one of the best of the entire franchise. It is absolutely pivotal for me to of seen to understand the emotional significance of the rest of the series. I saw some reviews that said it wasn't enough like the book, I'm grateful I never read the book and so I could just enjoy this for the cinematic marvel it is. I'm deeply impressed by the cgi after many years and a decade later. The acting, storytelling, and emotion far surpassed any of the other movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
"No magic, no fun","I saw HP and the Order of the Phoenix when it opened in theaters last year and now I have just finished watching the DVD of the film. I found the film quite disappointing. The script and the direction reminded me of old TV series. The ones where everyone stands around while the main character carries the load. Yes, there are fine actors in the movie and I am thankful for the few lines they spoke. This far down on the list of comments, I don't imagine anyone will be reading my remarks so I can babble on for a bit.Many of the previous comments were disappointed with Michael Gambon as a substitute for Richard Harris. When he appears in the third film, I too, was disappointed because Richard Harris made an indelible impression as Professor Dumbledore. Michael Gambon is, however, a fine actor and I soon got past rejecting him as the Professor. There is a lot to ponder if (though unlikely) a viewer has not read the book(s). The editing was a bit jarring, but then I remember the book was difficult. It is the pivotal book in the series and the characters, who after all, are the most important part of the tale were not presented with any imagination and I did not get a picture of a young person moving closer to the age of serious and (frightening) responsibility.I love Harry Potter and J. K. Rowling wrote a remarkable series. I dread that the same people are involved in the making of the Half-Blood Prince. I would have liked the films to live up to the books. Not that I expect word for word. Nothing like that. Just the marvelous revelations that took us with Harry Potter and company on the wonderful quest for adulthood.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
best Harry Potter yet and one of the best of the year,I have always like the Harry Potter and after I saw the third which I loved and the fourth I really like I could not wait for the fifth and which I was told that one was the best book by my friends. When I first saw the trailer I knew this movie was going to be great and then when I saw the movie when it came out I got a little more than I thought I would. This movie mood and feeling is very dark and you kinda felt what Harry was going though. The directing is fantastic for someone just come to the Harry Potter series and kept up with the good movie. The acting like the other movies are great and even better. I really don't know if the film keeps true to the book but I have heard mix reactions with that and other than that the writing is pretty good. If you are a fan of Harry Potter and fantasy film this is no question you have too see this film.,10.0,Anonymous,Action
Hogwarts united against the forces of evil... and oppressive bureaucracy?,"Looking back at the first films, I wonder if J.K. Rowling would have expanded the story so generously hadn't she been carried away by the success of the first books and their respective adaptations; probably getting new ideas with -this time- the cast members in mind and so many vehicles for new CGI ""wizardry"". Her 'baby' was undeniably caught in a virtuous circle and the fifth opus ""Order of Phoenix"" was no exception.Although this chapter is a bit tougher to follow, it's all to the credit of a writer to be able to amplify such a promising material and make a coming-of-age story over the span of seven books. Naturally, the tone is likely to evolve as the kids approach adulthood and the inevitability of the final confrontation with the forces of evil (""Goblet of Fire"" gave us quite a foretaste). So if the enchantment fades away in favor of more sinister plots and subplots, maybe it's only a way for fantasy to echo reality and the loss of innocence induced by the passing of times.Neville (Matthew Lewis) who was the butt of many jokes in the first stories, has nothing remotely comical about him anymore and Drago Malefoy (Tom Felton) goes from the spoiled cowardly brat to a dark young man who won't be played for laughs any longer. By contrast, the least blatant changes come from the leading trio whose evolution followed a more natural pace. And here they are in their fifth year at Hogwarts, which means they're pushing to 15, older than their counterparts but looking young enough to be believable teenagers. Eventually, the only one who's still played for laughs is Cousin Dudley (Harry Melling) shell-shocked after an impromptu visit from the Dementors (an eloquent symbolism as the attack is set in a playground).Yet the tone of this Harry Potter isn't as ""dark"" as it seems, only puzzling. After using a magical spell to put the Dementors away, a mail announces he's been expelled from Hogwarts. I didn't decide to give much weight to that because intuitively, I felt it was only a set-up to a denser story. Even the reaction of Uncle Vernon proved that it wasn't intended to carry some gravitas (I have a chuckle just thinking of Richard Griffith's ecstatic grimace, as if he was holding a seizure). Still, that was a perplexing set-up.Indeed, why wouldn't Harry Potter be trusted anymore? Wasn't that an obvious case of self-defense? Wasn't the Ministry of Magic overreacting a little? Why wouldn't they believe that You-Know-Who was back? Not to spoil the previous chapter but how did they think that 'incident' ever happened? Harry's judgment made me question the choices of Rowling to insert some comments against bureaucracy and political corruption in her universe, that's a level of maturity I didn't expect especially since it took time for the main plot to take its full shape.So what strikes in ""Order of Phoenix"" is that new loosely structure tone, combined with several new faces and a storyline that demands a lot of patience and has gotten me lost several times. Obviously, the big shots of the Wizard worlds don't trust Voldemort's return and officially appoint Dolores Umbridge as the new teacher of you-know-what, officiously a ""mole"" determined to whip everyone in line. While she has the traits of Cinderella's godmother, Imella Staunton plays Umbridge as a combo between Nurse Ratched and a caricature of Margaret Thatcher with the pink outfit of Jackie Kennedy. Maybe too one-dimensional to be an endearing villain, she was a scene-stealing presence.Speaking of the newcomers, there's the unbelievably sexy Natalia Tena Nymphadora Tonks (a name more fitted for a James Bond girl) and Evanna Lynch plays the dreamy blonde Luna Lovegood, a girl who seems to live in her own world and looks strange even by Hogwarts standards. Finally, there's Helena Bonham Carter who makes quite an entrance as the Death Eather cousin of Sirius Black: Bellatrix Lestrange. It's not much the way she looks than what she does in that film that would leave no skepticism about her status as a serious villain. There's a lot to digest in that film, as you can see, but from what I read, the book is the longest of the series, so the task of David Yates was rather Herculean.And it's no wonder the result feels like such a maze of secrets, traps, chases, escapes and revelations, including a great one about Harry Potter's father, giving him more depth and humanity than the eternal sanctification that started from chapter one. One can easily lose his track in the film but I guess the best way to stay focused is just to follow Harry Potter, he IS the touchstone of the series, and never knows more than we do. Perhaps that's the best thing about the series, we know there are events that precede him, a lot of foreshadowing, but as long as we stay with him, answers will come sooner or later, with style or heavy drama.Now of course, Harry's not the round little wizard with eyes getting wide after a successful magical trick, his personality has turned into something fully dimensional and far more complex than many franchise characters... he's not the protagonist of a rich universe, he's a universe by himself and maybe that's why he's often inclined to do the job alone, as if he felt his friends shouldn't venture in the same places than he, as if he had to carry alone the burden of being the ""chosen one"". But ""Order of Phoenix"" has this novelty (foreshadowed in the title) that this time, the game gets bigger... so they all work as a team, and not just a trio.It's all about spreading the wealth and the film has the juice of a thrilling adventure movie, the score that goes with it and the climax that redeems a few little flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
One of the better HP movies,"Harry Potter finally got a haircut lol.In all honestly, the Order of the Phoenix is one of the better Potter films.Disclaimer: I never grew up on the Harry Potter series nor have I read the books. So my review may be biased.The Order of the Phoenix does what every HP movie does. There is significant world-building, new elements to be added to the larger plot, and a satisfying wizardry action. Yet, Order of the Phoenix shines best by its use of character development.Character development in this film is superb. The audience learns to hate Umbridge even more (great work by Imelda Staunton, btw) and love Sirius Black. We are introduced to just how sociopathic and murderous Bellatrix can be. I can go on and on. Everyone portrays their character perfectly.The climax is also satisfying, full of action, and visually stunning.Great stuff.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
No.,"I'm crazy about the Harry Potter books, which can make my comment a little bias, since the book is usually better than the movie. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is my favorite Potter book and my least favorite Potter movie. I hated the pace of the movie. It tried to give the audience too much information at once. I was able to follow since I have read the books, but my friends and my family who haven't read the book did not understand much. I believe that the director is the very important in a film, because if the director sucks so does the actor. David Yates is not horrible but I don't think he has a great idea about the Harry Potter world. To me Harry Potter is much more magical and deep. I also think that the movie is way too dark. I understand that the book is also dark but this was just unpleasant. The adult actors were all amazing as usual, especially Umbridge. Daniel Radcliffe is not bad, neither is Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.The film is annoying if you are a Harry Potter fan, because it does not capture the 5th book. I was very disappointed, but there is still hope for the next ones.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
skillful adaptation,"This is a first: a Harry Potter movie that bests its source. The first, second, and fourth movies were okay at best, and the third one was as good as the book. But book 5 is the weakest of the bunch, and the filmmakers have done what I was hoping they would do - distill it. In the book, Harry's life reaches new levels of miserableness, and he turns into an irritating teenager. Making matters worse for the reader is the fact that the book sorely needs editing; it takes forever to get to Hogwarts. The book is filled with so much unpleasantness that it's a chore to trudge through. Plus, it introduces the series' most annoyingly cutesy secondary character, Tonks.The movie fixes all that. It looks great and is fast-paced, breezing through the opening pre-school scenes; Harry remains testy, but not overwhelmingly so; and Tonks is now a fun addition. The film also makes the Dumbledore's Army scenes more dynamic and retains the essence of two great new characters, spacey Luna Lovegood and insidious evil incarnate Dolores Umbridge. At the same time, this one suffers from an ailment that plagued its predecessors as well: in attempting to stuff the plot into a 140-minute movie, some depth is inevitably lost. Books 4 to 7 all need to be three-hour epics.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Order Of The Phoenix Entertaining For The Most Part,"Harry Potter and The Order Of The Phoenix is an entertaining film for the most part. It's a worthy addition to the franchise and director David Yates does an admirable job of turning this book into a movie which can go either way depending on how close they stay to the material. For the most part Order Of The Phoenix is enjoyable with some flaws. The talented cast are good in their roles including Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson. Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, David Thewlis, Alan Rickman, and Gary Oldman are great in their supporting roles but most of them don't have much to do and lack screen time. The movie still seems to be juggling too many characters with some of them getting the short end of the stick. Despite its flaws the film still has some action maybe not as much as the previous one but they're well executed with great special effects, a little romance, and some humor that make it enjoyable. I do prefer the Goblet Of Fire over this one but Order Of The Phoenix isn't that bad of a movie. It just could've been a little better if the movie was faster paced with less supporting characters and more action.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Another fun and great showing of wizardry,"EXPECTO PATRONUM!!And the looming danger continued to haunt Harry Potter. This time, the school got ransacked by the Ministry of Magic, and the students weren't allowed to practice magic.I knew that after the fourth one, this movie series would get more interesting and investing. And I was right. Now, Harry Potter got into deeper danger as his mentality started to decay as the movie went on.The school ransacking plot was pretty alright. It did make me want to see Harry Potter and his squad succeed and bring down the faculties. Most importantly, I appreciated that Harry was able to bond more with the other students, not just with the trio. They used a lot more magic, which was always fun to see.The best part of the movie was near the end, it was the first time that we saw a full-out battle between the wizards. The atmosphere was intense, and I enjoyed the lot of it.Overall, another thoroughly fun display of wizardry. Hope that it would continue to get better. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Action

The Order of the Phoenix...,"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is the fifth movie of the Harry Potter series and in this one we have Harry Potter and a few more people believing that Lord Voldemort is back and as in all the movies of Harry Potter and in this one we have a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. Harry also has some strange dreams which can not explain but only one thing he can understand and that is that Lord Voldemort is searching for something important.I liked this movie because of the plot and I believe that David Yates made a really great job in the direction of this movie followed the instructions of J.K. Rowling who wrote this novel. I also believe that the interpretation of Daniel Radcliffe in this movie was exceptional and that's it because we see Harry older and more mature than all the previous movies of Harry Potter and that was something interesting and new. I also liked the interpretation of Imelda Staunton who plays as Dolores Umbridge and I believe that her role in this movie was really difficult and she did a really good job in this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

One of the best Potter films yet,"I wasn't sure whether slightly inexperienced director David Yates could pull it off; after all, he is an unknown. I wasn't sure whether I would like such a short movie adapted from such a long book. Granted, the movie could've been a little better, but I was satisfied with it, and by the end, I was ready to see it all over again.""Order of the Phoenix"" is not like your typical Potter film (even the book is not exactly like your typical Potter story). It has emotional action, rather than physical action. It must have been daunting for the filmmakers taking on a project known for Quidditch matches and turning it into an emotional tour de force. The result: the most powerful Potter film made. I had never been exceptionally impressed with Daniel Radcliffe as an actor, but in this film, his acting commanded my respect and sympathy. He brought the distraught teen right from Rowling's pages to the cinema screen.I must also comment that Nicholas Hooper's score for the film is one of the best in the Potter series, nearly rivaling John William's. Much livelier and gripping than Patrick Doyle's in ""Goblet of Fire"".I liked how ""Order"" dealt with some of the teenage angst as well, such as love, emotional strife, and fighting. This film definitely did not overly focus on special effects. I was glad that there were a few comedic throw-ins here and there (most notably, Kingsley Shacklebolt's punchline to Cornelius Fudge).Imelda Staunton was nearly brilliant, and her portrayal of Professor Umbridge was disgustingly delicious. I certainly hope she is nominated for an Oscar for this performance. In the book, I hated Umbridge passionately, but Staunton actually made me want to see more of her. That might be my only small complaint about Staunton: I didn't hate her character as much as when I read the novel. A great acting job, though, nonetheless.Visually, ""Order of the Phoenix"" is stunning and beautiful, making Harry's world inviting. The headquarters for the Order, #12 Grimmauld Place, though, was not as seedy as I had imagined. I also preferred Alfonso Cuaron's version of the dementors in ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" than the ones in this movie.Those hoping for some action will not be disappointed. The battle inside the Ministry of Magic is exciting, and the special effects here are incredible.""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is a treat for fans of the movies: it has a great action sequence, as well as an emotionally-driven plot that ""refined"" cinema lovers will accept. Yates and the crew should be commended for taking such a hard book to adapt to theaters and making it into such a fine picture. My only complaints are that the beginning was lacking something (I can't put my finger on it) and that Michael Gambon needs to stop being an angry Dumbledore (gosh, how I miss Richard Harris!)There were also some plot details that weren't addressed in the film, including something important about Neville, and the story was a little rushed. And Nearly Headless Nick needs to come back, even if it is only visually. I look forward to seeing more of this cast, especially Radcliffe, Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort) and Evanna Lynch who played a likable, but strange, Luna Lovegood that fans of the books should appreciate. I hope Yates can refine his craft and make an even better film out of the 6th book... I can't wait.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
The coolest one in the series!,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the fifth installment in the HP series and this film may be a little bit action-packed, but it works for me.The story is dark and fun at the same time, but I have read the book and I know the plot and fans should know the plot of this movie and it is really amazing to see translated into a movie. David Yates is amazing and fantastic at his directing skills for this movie and I think it is not bad.The film got positive critical reviews, but with a few negative reviews about certain elements, but I don't find anything negative or bad about this film.Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson all return in their roles and they do a better job in their performances. The new and old cast are in this film and they all do amazingly well-done and their performances are good and amazing. Helena Bonham Carter scared me a little bit as Bellatrix Lestrange, but I got over it, every time I watch this film.It's hard to take the book and adapt it into the shortest Harry Potter film and Ralph Fieness as Lord Voldemort is creepy as hell and I think it's not bad.The exciting things are the acting, music, action and visual effects and they did a great job presenting all of this to us on screen.Overall, if you have not seen this Harry Potter film, see this film. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Best One Yet:  From the Acting to the CGI,"I am an avid fan of both the Harry Potter books and movies, and therefore I have quite a bit of experience in the world of Harry Potter when I say this: This is the best Harry Potter movie to date. On thing that David Yates seems to get that none of the other directors did is that the movie is ABOUT THE KIDS, how they interact, discover the miscarraiges of justice in the world, and make decisions based on who they are becoming as people. All in all, the best part of this great film was the acting from the kids' end. Student who have had fairly prevalent roles in the books finally got to exercise some sort of emotion, a notion that has been lost in the other movies due to a need to cram as much plot line in as possible. Finally, David Yates figured out the secret: Make a MOVIE out of Harry Potter, trim down the plot, create good and bad, and allow that actors to act and make a movie out of it, with special effects laying the foundation for the magic that they create. The film captured all of this deftly.Another thing that I absolutely loved about this movie was the fact that it was done so artistically and with so much thought to reality. Even in the second best movie in the series (Prisoner of Azkaban), there was nothing that chained the story of the Harry's tragic life to the real world. This movie uses acting, costume design, set design, and especially camera work to make this REAL. One of the best moments in the movie was the whole opening sequence. Dudley was a true bully, not this caricature of some fat kid throwing 12 year olds into trash cans. The unsteady cam shots were perfect for the action sequences in real life, and yet they were properly NOT used for the magical dueling, which was the magical part of the movie. Yates created general contrast in this film, which makes it more like a movie with a plot line and less like a book on the screen.All of this being said, there were serious portions of the plot line that were mangled in an attempt to trim the text, which was as thick as a California Redwood, though I loved every page. Some of the things that really bothered me were the absence of Sirius's two-way mirror (a hint for its true 'importance' in book 7?), Kreacher's whole plot line, and the lack of real animosity between Snape and Sirius, an element which, in retrospect, would have made the movie reallllly good. Hermoine's whole SPEW thing, for those of you who read the book, was a load of crap, and I'm glad they didn't include it. I was very pleased with the Occlumency scenes, as well as the whole Umbridge element and character (Immelda Staunton was positively BRILLIANT). As I have said, the best part of the film was the acting; the kids were great, and obviously the adults were spectacular, as Harry Potter is an excuse for practically every incredible character actor in Britain to get some easy money for fun. The kiss was frankly well timed and not awkward at all, all in the name of fun, and I really liked how the camera would pan to Ginny's contorted face every time Cho was mentioned (sorry for the spoiler, I found it amusing). Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix was the best Potter film yet, from top to bottom, and it Definitely did a good job of leading into the next film with that subtle feeling of growing hopelessness, as is conveyed so effectively in the book. 9 out of 10 stars... Bravo David Yates",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Lots of talking but has it's fine points,"Rating-7/10Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the fifth instalment of our boy wizards adventures and this time, it's getting even more dark. Yes Harry is back again with his magic world right behind him, well actually that really isn't the case here. With the events that took place in the preceding film, Harry is up against seemingly everyone in this movie, and the angst of some of these teenagers is sky high too. I felt the movie is a good one, It's the kind of movie that after 10 times of watching kind of doesn't come off as well, but still is a very worthy watch.Harry's year at Hogwarts is full of thrills but also a lot of fun, I didn't feel there was enough fighting of sorts or evenly spaced epic scenes, it is mostly confined to the beginning and the end with the middle being the funnier part. That said the fun parts are pretty funny and characters such as Neville Longbottom yet again step it up with Matthew Lewis becoming a regular feature to the gang. This is the first time I feel that Harry doesn't just need Ron and Hermione, he actually needs a lot of his fellow students and it makes it a much bigger film because of it.The film doesn't go crazy with new additions, but it does conjure up quite a few. The most impressive and absolutely spot on of these is Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge who's annoying persona and very shall we say, unorthodox methods make for a more intriguing character and a hard one to play but done very well by Staunton. Gary Oldman is back in person for this one and he adds to the wealth of the cast, this is the biggest when it comes to showing off British acting talent and really shows it off in a bright light for all to see.Now David Yates is brought in for this one and although I do think he does OK, I didn't think it was good enough. Now don't get me wrong I know a lot of people like him directing this but his ways are too obvious, the ways in which he makes some of the characters move or talk just seems fake, all in all though he is pretty good though. With Order of the Phoenix being such a huge book, it is a surprise that this is so short compared to what fans expected, but it works in it's favour, it tries not to dwell on certain parts too long and the sustained parts of talking would not have been good made even longer.I enjoyed the effects used in this movie, the massive scenes are there and the epic scale of the movie and it's budget are plain to see, but it doesn't go over the top with special effects in the middle, creating a kind of movie that doesn't feel well, not real. Nicolas Hooper makes a nice score, it works well because it doesn't contain those sweet snippets of song so often seen in the first movies but doesn't go all dark on us either, he balances it nicely so that the scenes move nicely with the music and long periods of just the score can work well too.I think Order of the Phoenix is not one of the best Harry Potter's, but does continue it's trend of just being consistent, may not make the book fans the happiest bunch with the amounts cut out, but this film is still as a movie, a fine entry into the franchise. Would recommend it to anyone, definitely one that even though is pretty dark stuff, can still be enjoyed by the whole family and importantly, even the little kids too.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Still going strong,"It might seem at first like the slowest moving episode, in the whole series, as the plot its a bit more relaxed and yet will cause the viewers too grow some towards a certain character, not wanting to say more for not revealing too much, but it is worth it to watch and find out who I am talking about. This movie will tie the knot between past and present, the former battles and the present one's. The former combatants and the contemporary one's who are actually for the most part, their children. It is still going strong in captivating its audience, but you could never expect less from the great author that is J K Rowling.Just an opinion. Just a thought. Just Steven J.

"Now, the situation is becomes serous!","I can't say that the plot of this part of the film is as interesting as the plot we are used to in previous parts of the film, but I can definitely say that this part breathed life into the idea of a new dimension of the film. To everything else in the film (characters, scenes, dialogues, etc.). All this heat-up of the plot, accompanied by the development of Lord Voldemort in the background, is a very nice way to say goodbye to the elements of the film that make it childish. Watching this part of the film, the world of magic we are used to becomes more realistic and thus better in the domain that no matter how much we know that magic is beautiful and useful it can also be dangerous and uncontrolled and that is a good effect. The plot in this part of the film is not as interesting to me personally as it was in the previous parts of the film, but I am willing to relax and let JKR do what it intended to do, and that is to finish this story spectacularly and as much as possible realistically. Introducing the character of Professor Dolores is a great idea but I think her tyranny could have been portrayed a little better with stronger effects to the detriment of other actions in the film that were unnecessary. I don't like the way Dolores was eliminated because I think it could have been a more spectacular way to symbolize the end of a disgusting tyranny. The Order of the Phoenix is a great idea, but unfortunately it has not been given the attention it deserves. I believe this is because it is impossible to screen a book, which we are used to when it comes to Harry Potter books. Perhaps we could have paid a little more attention to the Order of the Phoenix itself as well as Dumbledore's army because somehow Professor Dolores, the Order of the Phoenix, Dumbledore's Army and Lord Voldemort are key elements of the film. I see this film as a continuation of the seriousness of Harry Potter, which in the last scene in this part of the film made it clear that the next sequels will be more serious, darker and more realistic and therefore worthy of the name Harry Potter and his fame in the world. Finally all the children go into oblivion and all the adults enter the game. I would praise the murder of one of the main characters, at the end of the film, but I personally didn't like the way it was done because I think it was supposed to be more emotional and somehow stronger and bigger. Either way, I am ready to enter the final phase of this film from which I expect a dramatic and screenwriting spectacle.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
David Yates should be incarcerated,"I have waited a good time between reading the books and seeing this movie the first time to try to give the film a second chance with more of an advantage. It did not work at all.A book that was exciting and for the older audience was turned into pablum. I actually felt like gagging at times. And what he got wrong was completely needless and diminished the characters of the book. It saved neither length or added interest. The pace was tedious and the dull.At one point Umbridge forces McGonagall to step down and retreat. Anyone who has read the book knows how out of character that was and to weaken a strong female character was senseless. One scene has Dumbledore yelling at the students in a childish fit of bad humor. Again, out of character and needless. It added time to the scene and added nothing to the plot or the character. It diminished him.The actors were great. The movie should have been great. Instead it was a great disappointment.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Could've been better,This is a good movie but it could've been so much better. The main problem is that it feels incredibly rushed. The book is the longest in the series but the movie is one of the shortest in the series. They cut out every subplot and some of the main plot too and it feels completely butchered but if you watch it on it's own it's okay. It's fun and it also has some really dark moments and the ending is heartbreaking. You will see it for yourself. The actors are great and Daniel Radcliffe is absolutely amazing and he became a great actor in this movie and continued to be great. But the new- comers were also great. Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood and Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge took my breath away and I don't think they could find actresses who would do those roles more perfect. You will hate Umbridge more than any other character in the series. Same with Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. She's probably the most insane and psychotic character in the series. One more thing I can praise are the effects. Now it all looks completely believable and action sequences are eye candy and the climax is one of the most thrilling parts of the franchise. The movie was pretty good on it's own. Rushing was the thing that hurt this movie really bad but even if it's the weakest movie in the series it's still worth watching.,6.0,Anonymous,Action

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) - I Must Not Tell Lies? I'm Telling the Truth!,"Chapter 5 of the adventures of Harry Potter, ""The Order of the Phoenix"", has reached more complex ideas that makes this movie darker and dramatic so far. Now, although some parts in the movie were too pointless, I thought it couldn't beat the awesome new storyline added with cool cinematography and awesome music. And also, the new performances provided by Imelda Staunton, Helena Bonham Carter, and newcomer Evanna Lynch were all quite wonderful and super well-performed. I also love the change in Harry Potter's character where he starts becoming a teacher to the students, when teaching them to defend themselves, but he ends up being controlled by Voldemort and needs help of his own. Also, it looks to me that this Harry Potter flick got even darker with everything that is dramatic and mind bending.

Darkness Grows,"This is the first Harry Potter movie that I've given a rewatch. Jaime watches them regularly as they are comfort food for her. We been busy and she considers them to be Christmas movies since they usually feature the holiday since it is during the school year. Something I want to include is that this is when the books started to get interesting for me. Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is having more of a presence.What I didn't pick up on until this viewing and Jaime pointed it out, this has an eerie similarity to what is happening in the United States. The Ministry of Magic is doing shady things to silence Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) as well as Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) is the minister and he doesn't believe that 'He Who Should Not Be Named' couldn't be back. He also believes that Dumbledore is doing this to overthrow him. He takes steps to silence him and prevent a rebellion by installing Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) as the Defense of the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.Now what I'm getting at here is not only in the US. We are seeing the government do shady things to keep power. They also pretend like they don't. Harry and his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) are not doing what they're accused. When they are accused though, they rebel against the harsh rules in secret. It is funny, they wouldn't be if they would just let them go about their normal studies.The dark undertone is building as well. This is the first, but from here it keeps getting greater. The followers of Voldemort are called the 'Death Eaters' and they're making moves. This is led by Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs). I just love the different things they do here as the government buries their head in the sand and ignore it. That or they blame the wrong people as it feels real.I'll then shift over to the filmmaking here. I thought that it keeps getting better as more money is poured in. The cinematography is good to bring this world to life. I think that the CGI has gotten better. They do go heavy, but much like superhero movies, there is only so much that you can do practical. At least it is looking much better so there is that. Other than that, I'd say that the acting is good across the board. It is less cheesy. The soundtrack also fits for what was needed.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Not as worthy as other parts,This did not do very well on account of the hateful character of Dolores Umbrish; the unclear contexts; poor chemistry of Harry and Cho. Nevertheless there were interesting elements like direct encounter between the death eaters and order of Phoenix; of Dumbledore and Voldemort (who can forget). Also the importance of friendship and love as above any fear or evil is crux of the part. The surprise that the Wesley brothers offered in the middle is also worth mentioning. Overall you just cannot miss it as it is part of the legendary series.,7.0,Anonymous,Action
Needed more of the Order of the Phoenix.,"Based on the book Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, this is the fifth film in the Harry Potter film trilogy, a story where Harry and Albus Dumbledore are targeted by the Wizard authorities when authoritarian bureaucrat Dolores Umbridge takes over control of Hogwarts, all the while the threat of Dark Lord Voldemort returns full force.Like the previous film, this story takes on a more darker tone and tense drama as we see more of the Dark Lord and more of Harry's struggles as his past and his enemies torment him. I think the actors did an OK performance in this one, but I thought Radcliffe overacted in his Harry role somewhat. I do like the Order of the Phoenix concept, which is comprised of a group of wizard rebels whose goal is to defeat Voldermort and his cohorts. The rebels include the brave Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) and the unpredictable and crafty Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) - two of the better acting performances in the movie. The rest of the characters were a little bland, especially the Cho Chang character. The supposed love relationship between her and Harry was out of place for this movie, in my opinion, and is one of several scenes that distracted from the main plot.The special effects were pretty good and the battle between Dumbledore and Snape was the highlight of the film, though, I do wished Dumbledore's powers were showcased more not just in this movie but in the rest of the trilogy, since he is the most powerful wizard of all. In addition, I didn't think the Order of the Phoenix was emphasized enough; they should have showcased the group more and each of the group's wizards purpose in the movie. Instead, the movie focused too much on Umbridge and the Hogwarts students. So, what resulted was another average Potter movie.Grade C",6.0,Anonymous,Action
One of the better ones thus far.,"My wife and I finally decided to watch all the Harry Potter movies even though we might not be the targeted audience. The family movie genre is not really the things we normally watch but a bit of fantasy is something we like every now and then. And since the J. K. Rowling books have a huge fan base we were curious if all the fuss about it was worth it. Every night another Harry Potter movie until the end and credit where credit is due we do enjoy watching these movies. This one is one of the better ones, equal to the second one. The rest of them we rated seven stars. The young actors definitely matured and became much more convincing. The green screen scenes are also getting much better, which sometimes looked a bit too fake in previous movies. So yes the technology got better, but not only that. The Order Of The Phoenix is also much darker and in my opinion much better. Tonight another Harry Potter, curious if they will continue on this path.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Voldemort's back and you are going to be in trouble,"Yep, Mr. Riddle has returned and the minister of magic (Robert Hardy) refuses to believe this. Of course, everyone sides with the minister against Harry and his closest friends. Dudley (Harry Melling) practically gets sucked to death and the Dursley's (Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths) get a new flat screen T. V.The story plods along and leaves out key information revealed in the book. Every character stare at their feet and counts from one to ten before making their calculated statements. The film carries the story forward but does little to contribute other than a prophecy which takes all of five minutes.I do have to say that there was one good exception Helena Bonham Carter made a believable Bellatrix Lestrange the crazed dispatcher of Neville's parents.In place of story and acting, we have lots of CGI filler. The graphics are on par with today's technology except for the department of mysteries; that location looked so phony that you would think you were watching Saturday morning cartoons.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Middle of the Pack??,"This film feels more like a collage of scenes, a series of puzzle pieces, thrown at the viewers faster than they can piece together, just leading up to a final confrontation. Pacing is a big issue, leaving fans feeling disjointed, and those new to the series confused as to what exactly is going on. As a Hollywood film, it deserves praise, bringing this amazing world to the big screen, telling a compelling tale, and keeping the viewers glued to their seats for the duration of the movie. Overall the continuity of the film felt too rushed and disjointed, as opposed to the more fluid Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of fire. Relationships between the characters felt forced, which I found odd, considering the fact that the cast has been working together for 7 years or so. There were numerous plot-holes which ruin the film for me as well. Despite the flaws, i find this film quite compelling and a pretty good film, and i believe that without the books, this film would have been heralded as a masterpiece. Many critics don't like this film because its not ""accurate"" to the books. As someone who doesn't care about that, i believe the film is a good one deserves to sit in the middle of the pack for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Imelda Staunton steals the film...a darker than usual Potter...,"For a film that has been doing fantastic box-office business, one would hope that HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX would be a much more energized and fascinating movie than it is. Instead, it's like watching a rehash of previous Potter subplots, previous ingredients stirred into a new stew leading to a climactic confrontation with Lord Voldemort that ends in a blaze of fireworks.But the few ""big"" action scenes, while well staged with all the CGI effects bound to please the Potter fans, are hampered by a rather dull and listless storyline that has Potter looking at the dark center within himself as he plots how to avenge the dark forces trying to destroy him. And even the humor that is usually so much a part of these films is lacking, probably because EMMA WATSON and RUPERT GRINT have so little do do with the main action.But as a consolation, there are some striking performances, especially IMELDA STAUNTON as the overbearing and strict disciplinarian who injects a lot of humor into her wickedness. The film is fortunate to have her in a key role. Not much can be said for EMMA THOMPSON and MAGGIE SMITH who speak no more than a few lines, but ALAN RICKMAN and GARY OLDMAN at least have much more to do in supporting roles. Even the main villain of the piece, RALPH FIENNES as Lord Voldemort, has little actual screen time.One big ingredient the film has going for it is the background score by Nicholas Hooper which gives zest to the action scenes and the proper mood to all the dark sequences--of which there are plenty. Some of the sets are richly detailed and atmospheric, but too much of the photography takes place in the dark.Summing up: A so-so chapter in the Potter series. Hard to see why this one is proving to be such box-office gold when the story is less than satisfying.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

The most interesting out of the five,"The most interesting so far.The film has its fair share of symbolism, which helps when a lot of scenes have to be left out, so script writers has done a good job.Special effects are great and the most realistic so far. Big scenes and environments that are made by computer exceeds my expectations.Actors for new characters are well chosen, especially for Luna's role.""Harry Potter"" fans will probably miss a lot of scenes that were in the books, but if you remember how everything developed in the book, you can just add or alter the scenes in your mind. As for those, who haven't read the book, they won't miss a thing and so will avoid annoyance that comes watching all screenings of the books that we read. The film will be more enjoyable if you leave the comparison to the book for after the movie.One more thing I liked is that director made the whole Potter world more real and wizards, despite their magic and great stunts, are more human, than in other films, which were more fairy tales than dramas.All in all, this is really worth seeing, however, for small children it will be hard to understand or even not interesting as I doubt they would enjoy or understand the book.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Pretty good book to film transfer,"I went to the press screening past Friday. I wasn't expecting too much. I only saw the first 2 movies, and I didn't think they were that great. The books are just much better. But I must say, this fifth movie is pretty good. But the biggest part of criticism I have on this title is that they left too much out. I understand that the book just has way too many subplots to put in the film. But still it's a shame. Like the relationship between Harry and Cho. They only appear together in only 2 scenes!But there were also some good things. Like the attention for detail. Like the kitty plates on the walls of Umbride her walls. That getting us to Umbridge... She was played pretty well I have to be honest. Could be better. But still pretty nice. The only thing I didn't like is that you didn't get the feeling that the other teachers hate her as well, like you do in the books.A lot of things were different that I imagined while reading the book, but the final fight scene, did match a little bit. That was pretty nicely done. Special effect there were pretty OK (could be better, but they are not that bad)Well, pretty nice movie. Good book to film transfer. If you liked the previous movies, go see this. If you are a fan of the book. You can go see it... but be prepared for it to be a lot different than you imagined.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"Good movie, but it could have been so much better","The fifth movie in the Harry Potter tale has been taken on a new journey with a new director and a new style, however after seeing it's debut tonight in the ACT I can't help but feel a little disappointed.Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is without a doubt better then the first four films. The Acting is better, the writing is better and not only that but the plot and characters are much more interesting too. However in saying this their is so much more that could have been to make this movie simply magic.I am a big fan of the books that tell the tale of the young wizard, and so therefore I like the movie adaptations to provide the same enjoyment and the same magic that the books provide.For me the fifth film just feels a little rushed. Their are key scenes in this movie that although are very good could have been so much better. For instance the Fred and George saga within the book lasts some time, as they build up for their illustrious exit from Hogwarts. In the movie however their journey ends very abruptly. The scene in which they make their movie is visually quite spectacular and also very enjoyable, but I just feel it could have been done better, done a little differently as too add that extra punch too the movie.The climax to Harry Potter and the order of the Phoenix once again was very good, but it just needed that extra bit of work. I remember hoping as I was watching it show a bit more of the wizards and the followers fighting each other, but they never did. The scene is done very well, its a cool fight but their just isn't enough of the other characters doing individual stuff. I like harry, but it would off added something if they had actually shown Lupin, Ron and some of the other wizards fighting a bit more.This movie is very good, and I cannot deny that I enjoyed it a lot. Just maybe though they could have added something more to it, something that would have given it some extra kick, it is none the less definitely worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Feast or famine? A little of both.,"Let me start by saying that book 5 of J.K. Rowling's is my least favorite of the wonderful Harry Potter series. It's too long, with too much run-on writing, and it seemed to me that she had to manipulate Harry's personality to make the plot work, so much so that it often came off as contrived. That being said, the movie has gone a long way toward trimming the fat, and improving on the meandering of the book's nearly 900 pages. I'd have to say that, plot-wise, I enjoyed this Harry Potter more than any of the others. The new non-CGI characters, Dolores Umbridge, and Luna Lovegood, are transferred from the page to the screen with near perfection by Imelda Staunton and Evanna Lynch, respectively.Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg had his work cut out for him trying to preserve the essential elements of the book without disappointing his audience. The results are mixed. Some subplots are completely missing, yet there is still so much crammed into the 2 hour and 20 minute running time that any viewer who hasn't read the book will be at a disadvantage when it comes to understanding what's going on. For this reason, the editing is sometimes jumpy and disjointed. You have to depend on your knowledge of the book to fill in the gaps. The end result is, much like the first two movies, an exposition of the essential aspects of the book for fans, as opposed to a movie that generates its own drama. That being said, Mr. Goldenberg improved on the book in several respects. Harry's motivation's are more understandable, his relationship with his almost-girlfriend is carried off well. The battle in the Department of Mysteries is more believable and less protracted.The cinematography is grittier, the colors less saturated. The director, David Yates, has a nice sense of how to use the camera, sometimes up close and with a hand-held quality to give the action a, dare I say it, edgy feel; other times in long sweeping shots to convey scope and space. This is particularly effective during the last third of the film.This installment in the Harry Potter pantheon will please Ms. Rowling's loyal readers. If you are one of them, go see it. Now that I've had my fix, I can manage to wait for Book 7!",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Worst movie of the series,"After seeing this film I am left wondering, who is this director? and why does he want to ruin the Harry Potter series? But it's not all his fault, the screenwriter has left out so much of the feel of the previous movies. The movie felt too short and didn't have enough of the ""wizarding world"" and it's atmosphere. The movie felt hollow because other than Harry himself, the other characters had little involvement and no character development besides their obvious age difference from the last movie. Important scenes were paced too fast and lost the intended impact. Special effects were good, but borrowed heavily from Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. I just hope this director does a better job of the next movie or the producers see the light and get a better screenwriter and director combination. Thumbsdown from me",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Yes! I cannot believe I have now seen all the Harry Potter films, at least for now ;). Well after watching the last four Harry Potter films, I was definitely interested in seeing where the story would lead us next. The Order of Phoenix was absolutely astonishing and without a doubt the best Harry Potter yet. See, my friends who read the books didn't get much of a kick out it like I did, but I think they were just comparing too much book to movie. Who knows? After reading the books, I'm sure I'd be like that too, but movie wise I thought this was a great movie to watch and a terrific film for the summer.Harry is having extreme nightmares ever since the death of his fellow classmate, he knows Veldemort is on the loose and will do anything to stop him. But at Hogwarts no one believes him, especially the newest addition the professors, Delorus Umbridge, and this woman is here to make student's lives an absolute night mare. In the mean time Voldemort has plans for Harry and must get his hands on a prophecy that Harry has. Harry gathers classmates that finally believe him about Voldemort and join into an army that will end in the ultimate battle between good and evil.The Order of Phoenix is a roller coaster ride of action and a great story. The actors were terrific and the movie had great effects with the best story yet. I cannot wait for the next Harry Potter film, I admit it, I'm hooked. I can't wait to start reading the books, I bought them today, I guess I'm on the band wagon of the Harry Potter fans, if you can't be them, join them, lol.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Action

A Handsome Runt of a Phoenix,"The phoenix of legends died in flames and then rose from the ashes to new life. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" does no such thing. It neither croaks nor soars.No. 5 in the Potter series is visually spectacular, on the whole entertaining, but it's almost painfully single- and simple-minded in its appeal to a strictly juvenile audience. The story of Good vs. Authority (Imelda Staunton's spirited but ridiculous caricature of a Margaret Thatcher stick figure, zaftig as she may look here in ill-fitting clothes) is not only primitive, it's dangerous: even children need to know that real Evil is not that cardboard-cutout obvious, that Snidely Whiplash not a Macbeth makes. J.K. Rowling's writing is on the lazy side here.And yet, strangely in case of such a youth-oriented film, it's a dark, scary story, not only with the continued (escalated?) all-around torture of Harry, but with the Ministry of Magic takeover of Hogwarts School playing out as totalitarian steamroller, a kind of ""1984"" without the dance numbers.But first, director David Yates, cinematographer Slawomir Idziak, production designer Stuart Craig, and the throng of special-effects folks from ILM, MPC, Framestore CFC, Warner Bros., etc., etc. should get major kudos for one of the best-looking movies around. For every dumb broom-riding scene, there are some unforgettable visuals of majestic vistas, unending, rich interiors, a cataclysmic cascade of glass structures, and so on. A truly handsome production. Small touches, such as the demonstration that even wizards need Oyster Card on the Underground, are enjoyable.The core cast comes through well: Daniel Radcliffe could easily do Harry in his sleep, but he is very much awake, Emma Watson's Hermione has some new angles (she allows herself a small thrill in facing danger), Rupert Grint's Ron is reliably innocuous.Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is believably magical, Alan Rickman's Snape is once again on the cusp of malignant-looking beneficence (and we do learn something interesting from his past), but not all is well. Ralph Fiennes' noseless Voldemort is annoying, that magnificent duo of Maggie Smith and Emma Thompson get screen time of a few seconds, and Helena Bonham Carter's deranged turn is brief and rather ludicrous. It's actually more fun to watch lesser-known actors making the best of their moments at the periphery.There is a lot to see, a lot to enjoy in ""Phoenix,"" but it's without a center, substance, heart.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

Before the movie i went in thinking, ""damn the prophecy is trimmed down, quiditch is gone, no hospital scene, etc"" but from the moment the movie started i was completely blown away. I LOVVVVVEDDDDDD this movie. The times when they were in the room of requirement was awesome. Watching everyone learning how to do a patronus made me smile the entire time.

Harry Potter,"With the end of the last Harry Potter movie (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) being so tear jerking, you should brace yourself for darker themes in this movie. We will lose a most beloved character in this one and be introduced to the most hated person of all time. There is not a soul in this world that doesn't hat Umbridge, in facts in many polls she surpasses Voldemort himself to attain her title of most hated character ever. With the return of Voldemort in the last book things were bound to get tough for Harry but this movie is not about the good versus bad. It's about the love and the effect of war on the people we love. It's a story of the struggle that Harry Potter faces as the boy who lived. It's a brilliant watch like the rest of the Harry Potter movies. It's a must watch movie for everyone. Be sure you watch the previous movies thought to understand it. This movie was suggested by Flickstree site which i think is awesome.",,Anonymous,Action
The Best Harry Potter to Date,"With the fifth Harry Potter film finally arriving, there were huge expectations that many were upholding. Would new director David Yates ruin the series or would he effectively translate the magnificent J. K. Rowling book to the screen? Who would play the loopy Luna Lovegood? Would the fifth film be sufficient in establishing a mature and dark mood? All these questions and more were answered, all with incredibly positive effects in the best film out of the whole series. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix translates perfectly on screen in the most flawless installment yet. Starring in the film are regulars Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, and this time around they are joined by newcomer Evanna Lynch, and a supporting cast that can only be described as ""amazing"".This time around (for anyone who hasn't read the books) Harry gets expelled from Hogwarts for using magic outside of school, and he is taken to the House of Black where he awaits trial for his mistaken crime. He discovers that Dumbledore, Sirius, and others have formed a meeting group called 'The Order of the Phoenix' that has been around since his father and mother were still alive. Throughout the school year, Harry and friends must face many hardships, including the evil Professor Umbridge, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher that may be much more than she appears.The directing from David Yates is undoubtedly the best in the entire series. He uses the stylistics and darkness of Alfonso Cuaron coupled with the love for the material that Christopher Columbus so openly displayed. The picture seems more based around Harry this time around, which is fitting considering how dark and revolved around Harry that the book was. David Yates does an astounding job playing on each actor's strengths and weaknesses.Which brings us to another point: the acting was, for the first time, completely powerful and great in every category. No longer do we have that strange inexperienced boy that Daniel Radcliffe once was; he is now a grown boy with amazing flexibility and skill as an actor. He plays Harry so well that sometimes you forget he is an actor. He does so well with Harry's transformation from innocent boy to testosterone-fueled teen who is desperate for answers. His performance was genius, and for once it was without a single flaw. While Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have far less screen time than they did in the previous film, they do wonders with their characters. It is so obvious that each of these actors has grown so perfectly into their roles that they can just act so flawlessly. The three newcomers are simply extraordinary. Evanna Lynch couldn't have been better as the insanely sweet and wickedly weird Luna Lovegood, and she does so well with her first big role. She wasn't exactly how I originally pictured Luna, but now I can't imagine her any differently. Imelda Staunton was simply outstanding as the vile Professor Umbridge; she is one of the most memorable villains in all of literature, and her hatred transports to the screen in all of its perfection and effectiveness. Although Helena Bonham Carter had very few scenes, she always manages to catch attention being the scene-stealer that she is. She plays the part of Bellatrix amazingly well, and her interactions with the other characters seem almost unreal. Gary Oldman was also great as Sirius, and his few scenes with Harry were magnificent. Matthew Lewis is emerging majorly in his breakout performance as Neville Longbottom, and this time is no exception. The supporting cast was all just so brilliant, and they really made the movie all the better.As for how close this managed to be to the book I was actually surprised. Unlike with Goblet of Fire, they didn't completely slaughter it this time around. I mean sure, there were some really amazing things that were left out such as the whole 'Weasley is Our King' thing and many interactions that Harry has with Draco Malfoy, but for the most part, they mostly stick with the book and churn out an enchanting tale. Harry Potter is just as good as ever, only this time it's better. They did cut lots and lots out, but at the end of the day, what film based on a book DOESN'T cut things out? Sometime sacrifices must be made, and I think that the final product they ended up with was sufficient enough for me. Hopefully with David Yates returning to direct the sixth film it will end up half as good as this one.As a huge fan of the books, I was highly anticipating this film, and it did not disappoint me in any way. David Yates' direction is new, fresh, and surprisingly dark, and the action sequences and special effects are mind-blowing. This may just top Transformers as one of the best films of the summer, and possibly one of the best movies of all time. It was certainly by far the best Harry Potter film, that's for sure.

Spectacular!,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the fifth installment of the J.K. Rowling saga and like each of its films, they keep getting darker and better not to mention bringing along a different crowd rather than the readers, the fans of the atmosphere, or people who have crushes on the actors.David Yates is the fourth director of the HP franchise and doesn't too much of a bad job turning a six-hundred something book into a 138 piece of entertainment (note: this is the shortest Harry Potter saga so far. Will it be two hours next time?) Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson return to their roles as Harry, Ron and Hermione in which in this latest installment Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) is back and nobody believes Harry Potter's story, not even his own peers once he returns to school for his fifth year. The stakes are high this time with everybody in Harry's path becoming a danger to him, even his muggle of a cousin Dudley Dursely who gets struck by a Dementor.Things are changing in Hogwarts after Harry's use of magic in front of humans as Dolores Umbridge, played wickedly with delight by Imelda Staunton, takes over as the Dark Arts Teacher and has set a fear through the students and faculty by changing rules, firing teachers, having the Ministry of Magic all over the school's business and so forth. Harry Potter on the other hand has figured out that his godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) was part of a group along with Harry's parents and families of the young hero's friends where he comes up with the group Dumbledore's Army to teach whoever wants to get rid of the evil that's heading their way to Hogwarts.Order of the Phoenix is spectacular entertainment from minute one where like Prisoner of Azkaban, you don't have to read the books or be a fan of the series.This movie's for anybody.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
"Movie was quiet a let down, Plot failures and Bad effects.","I just watched this movie on the first night in theaters, July 11, 07, and this movie was a big let down. Besides absolutely nothing happening throughout this movie, the movie itself seemed dank and dull. The lighting was set at a low apparently as the whole movie seemed kind of colorless. The movie is lacking a LOT of action and has many plot holes that have not been filled. One particular part I cant stand is the fact they introduce the ""Order"", a secret society formed by Dumbledor himself, but after the beginning scene with HORRIBLE GREEN SCREEN EFFECTS you never really see them again. You capture a glimpse at the ending fight scene where ___________ dies. Another is the fact the overall tone and energy of the movie seemed missing. It almost appeared to me like the actors were having a bad day when filming this movie. The movie seemed based on the book and according time lined fairly properly. There appeared to be a ""deleted scene"" or ""blooper"" almost as me and my buddies had pointed out where they show Harry, Hermione, and Ron, laughing away at some little joke on emotions. It turns out its actually supposed to be there... apparently.Terrible Green screen when flying.... and also with computer graphics. Did this director ever see transformers??? cause it rocked this movie for effects and graphics!Overall I was kind of let down. Everything happened WAY to fast... Seemed much like the movie Eragon if anyone remembers it.Effects: 6/10 (nothing cool... animations SUCKED, green screen FAKE LIKE NO OTHER!) Plot: 7/10 good but lacking.

Solid entertainment and well-laid foundations for a grande finale,"Yes people, it really is well worth seeing this film. For starters, it's totally Quidditch-free. Instead it offers darkly atmospheric spookiness and cleverly executed special effects. The real charm of this film is in the cameo roles. Natalia Tena is a little bit gorgeous as the tomboyish Nymphadora Tonks. Alan Rickman's Snape is magnificent as ever. Helena Bonham Carter virtually steals the movie in her tantalising few minutes on screen as the psychotic Bellatrix Lestrange. Imelda Staunton's relentless, sadistic and pink-clad Dolores Umbridge rules Hogwarts with an iron fist. Filch and Kreacher contribute a few well-judged sneers, and Mark Williams makes a pleasingly eccentric Arthur Weasley. It is extremely pleasant to see a gruff and masculine Rupert Grint just for once, and a low profile, chilled out Emma Watson. Admittedly Daniel Radcliffe's performance leaves something to be desired and Gary Oldman is surprisingly bland. However the parts add up to a pleasing whole, and the foundations are well laid for Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"Great For The Readers, Somewhat Harsh For The Watchers","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, though definitely the best adaptation of the Harry Potter Novels to date, assumes the fans know the book too many times. From the simple act of going to the Hog's Head (which was in Hogsmeade, as I had to tell a friend), to the cut ending dialog between Dumbledore and Harry, there was too many things that were cut that should have been kept. Especially since the longest book became the shortest movie.However, there are many points that are better seen than read, especially near the climax of the book. The special effects were spectacular, and seem to get better with each release.The cast, of course, shines in OotP. The trio are growing up, and are able to convey a much greater emotional range as the books expand the emotions conveyed. Alan Rickman shined as the greasy and mysterious Severus Snape, though it would have been nice to see more of him on screen. Gary Oldman finally gets much needed screen time with Harry, and excels in the role of Sirius Black. Michael Gambon does an excellent job portraying Dumbledore, though, I must admit, I still miss Richard Harris's portrayal. Newcomer Evanna Lynch's portrayal of Luna Lovegood was spot on and excellent. Imelda Staunton's portrayal of Dolores Umbridge was excellent, easing my worries after seeing the trailers. And finally, Ralph Ralph Fiennes was perfect and portrayed the evilness of the character far better than even in Goblet.In summary, Order of the Phoenix is an excellent adaptation, though if you're a book loyalist, you may leave the theater with a bad taste in your mouth. The essence and plot of the book are portrayed excellently by David Yates, and the music is touching and fits the scenes well (Kudos to Nicholas Hooper in filling in the rather large shoes of John Williams). The movie was shorter than it should have been, but portrayed excellently in the time that was allotted. Definitely a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Worst Potter Movie.,"My 10 hour wait in line was ended in disappointment. From the first 5 min.s I could tell this wasn't going to be a very good movie. If you compare this movie to all of the others in the series, it has a completely different feel. It felt like a rough draft. Nothing transitioned well. The actual film footage was fantastic, but the way they placed it together made it hard to follow and very rocky. Don't even get me started on the fight scene and death. It was so short. 5 secs: Arrived. 5 secs: Looked. 5 secs: Fought. 5 secs: Death. 5 secs: Fight. 10 secs: Harry on the floor. I know there was a lot to put into this movie, and they accomplished getting all the main events, but it was just not put together properly. I think even 10 min more would have made this film so much better. The best way I can put it: They seem to have sent it out the rough draft.P.S.Luscious Malfroy looked so different.Snape looked even uglier than usual, I guess that sticks more towards the book.I'm happy they did the flashback with James and Snape.I'm sad that they didn't put any info. about Neville and the Prophecy.It seemed small characters got more screen time than characters like Ron and Hermione.

Its better than Goblet but by far is still mediocre,"Of course harry potter fans will flock to this film but from an Oscars point of view? The Harry Potter films are probably at their best in music (not Goblet though), and special effects. It is always hard to translate from book to movie. The Harry Potter films are nothing to be ectatic about, the first two were at best mediocre. The third was perhaps the most boringst in climax but it made up for that with its style that proved to be more magical and medieval. The fourth was a big mess where it seems very depressive and the magic is somewhat gone. The fifth movie stands somewhere between, it is dark yes, but it has lost all feeling of magic. No Oscar worthy performances here. Everything is solid in this latest film, but it fails to be a phonomenon like Return of the King. I believe the 6th film will have around the same attendance as this film with the 7th probably being a blast. It is still good entertainment though, its better than most films out like Pirates 3 or the heavily overrated Spiderman3. I would rather watch this than The Simpsons movie or transformers (which was very dull and only gains box office from popualrity.)",6.0,Anonymous,Action
A must see,"There were many things left out of the movie, that made the book an interesting read. HOWEVER, I loved the movie because it stayed true to the central plot of the book and carried that theme throughout.Movies, by nature, cannot incorporate every detail from a book when an adaptation is made. What they can do however, is put in the most important plot points and try to capture the essence of the book OoTP does this very well in my opinion. If you were to tell someone what the plot of the book was, the details you wouldn't forget, were those that made it into the movie--they moved the plot forward. The details and plot points that didn't make it in, while enriching in the book, would have added too many unnecessary details to the movie.Why 9/10 and not 10/10? A few things: Harry's final talk with Dumbeldore should have been more explanatory--there was time, and in the book it explained some important series plot points. No ghosts...i like the ghosts; they help Hogwarts feel fantastic and add to the aura of magical wonder (I do not agree with those who say that the magic is gone, its just a different type of magic).See the movie its definitely worth your time and money. Read the book its definitely worth your time and money. To blame the movie for not being exactly the same as the book is beyond silly and takes away from all that is good in the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Now I see: they're portraying totalitarianism.,"Whereas it's been a few years since I read the novel on which this movie is based, I had forgotten a few things, so the movie refreshed my memory. Obviously, any book-to-movie adaptation is bound to have at least a few flaws. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" certainly can't equal the book exactly, but I really like Imelda Staunton's role as fascistic Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Dolores Umbridge (I assume that if you're reading this, then you know what that class is; if not, then read the books first). This vile woman, dressed like a slightly drabber version of Jackie Kennedy, makes it her goal to overthrow Albus Dumbledore and totally seize control of Hogwarts,* engaging in all manner of torture when she deems it necessary, all the while sporting an unctuous smirk. Maybe it's just me, but I derive that this installment in the series is an indictment of totalitarian regimes.Of course, I might just be reading too far into the movie. I figure that the main purpose is probably to get enthralled in the magic, and it's hard not to get enthralled. Admittedly, the younger stars come across as a little silly, as they try to be funny but can't really get it down. No matter, the adults all know what they're doing. A scary but delicious addition here is Helena Bonham Carter as death eater Bellatrix LeStrange. Looking sort of like Elvira, she turns Bellatrix into the sort of character whom we would expect Bonham Carter to play in a Tim Burton movie, and she does this to a tee; I almost felt scared watching her on screen.Overall, while the movie does have its flaws, I recommend it. I consider it a solid addition in the series. Reprising their roles from the previous installment(s) are Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Richard Griffiths, Fiona Shaw, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Alan Rickman, David Thewlis, Brendan Gleeson, Gary Oldman, Ralph Fiennes, Jason Isaacs and Warwick Davis.*Not but a few hours after I watched the movie, I heard a report on the news about a newly released tape divulging the extreme hostility that Richard Nixon felt towards George McGovern, even after winning re-election. Well, Dolores Umbridge is even worse.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Formidable Adaptation: book reader's review,"Unlike some of the previous Harry Potter (HP) films, mostly uncompromising adaptations which visualised but failed to deliver the charm of the books to the big screen, 'Order of the Phoenix' (OotP) is a film at heart, borrowing from the book but also improvising to recreate the full range of emotions experienced while reading the book. Where the previous films butchered the plot and subplots, often mishandled the crucial moments and overly stepped into banal territory, OotP is oddly satisfying to watch.OotP, book five, is the thickest book of the entire series. While the first three books were short enough to be adapted to film without neglecting too much (with a honourable mention to 'Prizoner of Azkaban'), book four, the 'Goblet of Fire', fell into the pitfall of becoming a synopsis of the plot, essentially cataloguing the significant events and being notably 'empty'. Thankfully, this film avoids that very pitfall, delivering a fully functioning film that delivers a story full of wonder and adventure that is so characteristic of J. K. Rowling's creation.Of particular improvement is the overall superior performance by the entire cast. While the adult characters have always been at least adequately portrayed, younger ones (including the main trio) have been mediocre. However, aging (I assume) seems to have greatly improved their performances. Radcliffe does a better-than-ever job of portraying Harry's troublesome journey through adolescence. Evanna Lynch, portraying the dreamy Luna Lovegood, also does an exceptional job and almost outshines her fellow school-mates. Also noteworthy is the near-perfect depiction of the horribly hateable, not to mention pink, Dolores Umbridge by Imelda Staunton. The rest of the Order members, even those that get little screen time, are also well done.The film is an audio and visual feast. The CGI work is commendable: everything from thrilling magical duels to the unveiling of number 12, Grimmauld place and the adorable and funny Grawp. The soundtrack is also praiseworthy. The characteristic HP 'theme' from the first Chris Columbus film is not overused and the emotional sequences are well accompanied by emotive music. Even the depiction of simple elements such as London, Privet Drive and Hagrid's hut have been improved, making it all seems more realistic rather than pure fantasy to be forgotten upon leaving the cinema.OotP is a very enjoyable film and many HP readers and non-readers alike are bound to be entertained. To the readers, my advice is to overlook the little 'issues' here and there and to simply enjoy it. Unfortunately, a few non-readers may find themselves confused. This is the intricate problem with adapting the complex book into a mere two hours and eight minutes, and only so much blame can be placed on the film creators. Either way, I strongly recommend you read the book(s) before watching the film. The books are and have always been far superior, and to watch the films first only spoils the books. Overall, this is a very formidable adaptation of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix as the series becomes more mature, just like Harry, and darker, with the rise of Who-Must-Not-Be-Named to power. The best HP film so far, this one should not be missed.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"good film, but still not nearly as good as the book","For me, Order of the Phoenix was the hardest of the books to get through and also the one that I enjoyed the least. But, as it was the longest - it condensed easily enough. I always feel like the HP movies jump around a lot, and I'm often confused as to how someone who has never read the books can follow them. Regardless, this movie was indeed entertaining. I cheered, I scowled, I laughed - it was all there. I still do hate that so many of the story lines from the book are changed, but I understand that you just can't have everything...and sometimes things need to be simplified here or expanded there to allow for some ""movie magic."" To all you Potter fans out there, do go see the movie (just keep an open mind) - BUT then go read the book again to remind yourself what really makes this series truly wonderful.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
A delightful and gripping transformation of a boring book,"This film is about The Order of Phoenix, that was revived to fight against the Dark Lord.I found the book really boring, tedious and full of unnecessary anger, so I was expecting a film that was similar. I am glad to report that I was wrong! The film adaptation is absolutely delightful. The pacing is right, the scenes are full of colours and magical happenings. The jokes are great, and gets the whole cinema giggling. The visual effects are stunning, especially the scene featuring moving terraced houses. I am also glad about the fact that Harry's anger is toned down a lot. Dolores Umbridge's character is so annoying, which means that her character development is excellent! Luna Lovegood is actually adorable in the film. I find this adaptation very enjoyable, and it is much better than the book!",,Anonymous,Action
Rather (Love)Good Film,"I've been to a lot of blockbusters lately - Spider-Man 3, Pirates 3, Die Hard 4. But Harry Potter 5 was the first one whose line actually busted a block; going all the way around it by the time the doors opened for the 10:15 show at the Senator. I figured this show wouldn't be as hectic as the midnight showing, but since this was the first day the film was out, I should have known better. This was no ordinary line of moviegoers, either. Nearly half of them were sporting the usual magical garb.So, the movie. It's odd-numbered, and so, like the first and third movies, I expected it to be good. I can say rather confidently that it was slightly better than good. It did an outstanding job of covering everything crucial to the saga, without feeling rushed or slow. The pace of the movie was very nice. The production design was almost telepathic; I found settings I had conjured in my mind while reading them respectfully recreated in even greater detail than even Rawling could have imagined.This film could not cover everything in the book, but since I haven't read the book since it came out, nothing stood out as conspicuously missing. The infamous Quidditch World Cup scene from Goblet - where we never get to see a second of quidditch - was so jarring and inexplicable, it basically ruined that fourth film for me. But Phoenix is a much smarter, much more logical movie; it cut what wasn't needed and, like I said, kept what was necessary.The characters, as usual, are spot on, to borrow a term from the Brits. The main trio is getting older, and they're becoming better actors. I was absolutely smitten with Luna Lovegood, unquestionably my favorite Hogwarts student. The choice of actress was absolutely perfect, as his her portrayal of the spacey yet oddly perceptive girl with striking features. I especially enjoyed the chemistry between her and Potter in particular. Luna's character may be straightforward, but easily the deepest and most intriguing of Harry's friends.I was also glad Sirius Black had some screen time, although still not as much as he deserved. Of course, he was nothing but a CGI face in a fire in Goblet, so it was good to just see him again.Dolores Umbridge is also, well, just as I expected her. I'm glad they didn't go with a hideous, toad-like woman with CGI features, that would have more closely followed the illustration of her in the book; the fact that on the surface she actually looks like a sweet, kind woman makes her all the more chilling as she puts the vice-grips to Hogwarts and makes Harry open his veins.Astonishing how far the film series has grown with these characters, both in mood and style. The first film was light and whimsical, mirroring the characters' youth and innocence. This is the darkest film yet in the franchise, darker even than the fourth. But enough about the fourth movie; this one was far, far better film, if for nothing else, because it was coherent. It covered so much material so well. I'll probably see it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Oscar Prediction,"I feel this film is good on so many levels I wouldn't be surprised, like Return of the King, if it earns an Oscar nomination for Best Picture and Supporting Actress Imelda Staunton. Stands alone as a major motion picture, and not just a kid film. My daughter argues that she didn't feel enough character development, however, even in this coming of age book, the focus is on Harry's' inner turmoil and the theme that hardship and tragedy make you stronger. As more characters have been introduced by Rowling, it is Harry's growth and maturity that remain at the center of the story and I felt that Director David Yates captured this beautifully, along with some fine performances from Daniel Radcliff, Staunton, Alan Rickman, and Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
The Best Potter flick so far,"The book Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is unwieldy and cluttered, so much so that it is by far the most boring and weak of the books so far. However the movie has taken the ingredients of what could have been a great book and turned them into a great film by trimming off most of the excess fat.The world of wizardry is in turmoil as Voldermort is seizing power once again. But rather than do something, the Ministry has chosen a stance of aggressive denial, where ideas about Voldemort's return are stamped out through the poisonous representative at Hogwarts Delores Umbridge ( a very unlikeable Imelda Staunton ) whist Voldemort recruits his former Death Eaters, including the insane Bellatrix Lestrange ( Helena Bonham Carter ).This is a well-put together story; helped by the fantastic cast, all playing their part, particularly Michael Gambon as Dumbledore and Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy. But it is the two polar opposites in Snape ( Alan Rickman ) and Sirius ( Gary Oldman ) that steal the show, both of whom Harry shows very different sides of his personality to- and through which new revelations about their characters are unveiled. Their chemistry with Harry in their scenes together is remarkable.Order of the Phoenix is a great film and it shows that sometimes films can be better than books, even in a massive book franchise like this.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
something is missing in this film but I can't decide what,"This is the first Harry Potter film I have seen, with no prior knowledge of the series or the books. Perhaps not the best place to start, but with the considerable recaps of what has gone before, 'The Order of the Phoenix' proved reasonably easy to follow.What's missing is an emotional core. Daniel Radcliffe does not convince as Harry, a superwizard in waiting. He may be without his full powers but he does appear weak and unchallenging, with moments of bravado which do not sit well with the rest of his character. Having a child character carry a film is always going to be a problem - as it was for the Chronicles of Narnia as well - and in comparing Harry Potter with, say, Frodo Baggins, they are worlds apart.The plot is in some ways derivative of the classic good vs evil battle - as seen in LOTR, Star Wars, and others. The flashbacks are overdone and the characterizations sometimes too much like a cartoon - particularly Imelda Staunton's Doleres Umbridge. And is that really Emma Thompson in thick jam-jar glasses? And Ralph Fiennes without a nose? The classy cast is perhaps the biggest draw for mature viewers of the Harry Potter series (we have Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters, David Bradley, Robert Hardy, Alan Rickman, Gary Oldman, etc.) but with a few exceptions, they didn't really convince, only made me think of other roles they've done which were so much better.Special effects - the class conjuring up rabbits and horses and the like was impressive, as were the final scenes of fight and destruction, and the twins' firework display. But the miniatures were sometimes obvious, which is a shame.In pace, the film drags for long periods and gets bogged down in pseudo philosophy or silly jokes. The two strands don't really fit together.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Not quite what I expected but BRILLIANT non the less!!,"After watching Goblet of Fire, I will admit I was disappointed with the execution of the movie. I will further denote, that this is due to reading too hard into the book. I was expecting a play by play word for word and was horribly disenchanted when this turned out to not be the case. Some wise words were passed on to me, ""It is based on the book, its not the book"" With OotP on the way I finished reading the book, but did not fool myself into thinking it is going to play out the way I want it too.My hats off to you David Yates, you pulled it off. The 5th instalment of the most, in my opinion, enticing series of books to hit the selves in a long time was well worth the anticipation.I will acknowledge that sitting, watching the movie, you do real off the scenes in your head of what should and what should not be happening. Any avid supporter of the Harry Potter series would. But as the movie carries on, with its climaxes, excellent cinematography and stunning CGI, you can't help but enjoy.My review my count for naught as a critic, but as a true enthusiast and constant lover of the books and movies. Give it a chance. Even if you have to see it twice, it is worth it!",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Everything is going downhill,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the first Harry Potter movie directed by David Yates. Some fans love Yates and his different style, but there are people who don't like him, myself included. Sure, he's the one responsible for my favourite half of the series, where Harry is growing up and everything is darker. But in the movies the characters aren't as deep and the darkness feels more like a colour scheme than a change in the story telling.Yates's style chooses action over the story - which makes no sense when considering what the novel was like. Order of the Phoenix had very little action, but it explored wonderfully, for example, Harry after seeing Voldemort returning and seeing Cedric Diggory being brutally murdered. In the movie you can see it bothers Harry, he is incredibly angry, but that's that. If you haven't read the book it only seems like Harry is having his puberty and therefore a bit moody, even if you could claim he has a case of PTSD.There are many emotional scenes in the novel that weren't included in the movie. They were completely forgotten or replaced by something really, really weird, apart from few that were important to the plot - they saved the scenes that were important when looking at this one movie, but ignored the story as a whole, and they seemed to figure character development was not that important. Harry Potter series is not seven separate stories it's one story in seven parts.At this point it's clear the filmmakers didn't care about the story as much as making the movies and making fans watch them and just get through the whole series.But it's lovely to see the film allowing few characters develop properly: like Neville during the DA. They tried to fake Ginny developing as well by only showing us that she is indeed amazing with spells. Still the filmmakers have forgotten to give her any sort of personality. I love her in the books but in movies she's just an empty husk - skillful of course, but she's not as interesting as in the books. ' Order of Phoenix is over-simplified and is trying to force a story into a film form in the easiest way possible. Yes, sure, they didn't have so much time to focus on the stories individually considering the stars were growing up but still, this is ridiculous.",4.0,Anonymous,Action
"Very Entertaining, yet Disappointing","First off, let me start by saying I have not read all of the books. I picked up the first 3 and loved them, but have made a horrible habit of not keeping up with the series. Ignoring that fact, I still make it a point to see these movies as they make their way into the theaters.Anyways, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, in a nut shell, was amazing. However, as my summary states, I was still somewhat disappointed with it. Mainly because of all the dialogue. The 4 movies prior to this one were crammed full of action, plot twists, etc., while this one was crammed full of talking. Now, I realize that this book apparently was leading up to events in the next novel (which I have not read so I can't spoil anything for you) but I was still expecting more.Although I was disappointed with the lack of action, I was highly impressed with how dark they made this film seem. Luna seemed like the most morbid character they have yet to bring into the series. She did an amazing job.The kids playing the roles in these films are doing a fantastic job. I don't think they could have cast a better team to portray these roles. Having said that, I do have a problem with one of the cast members. Dumbledore. Michael Gambon is fantastic actor, but not for a role like Dumbledore. I was under the impression that Dumbledore was to be somewhat laid-back and passive like he was first, played by Richard Harris. Gambon almost seems like he has TOO much energy for role.All in all, I gave this movie an 8/10. Very entertaining and enjoyable to watch. Great for all ages!",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Love It! But wish it was longer,"I saw the movie on the premiere. It was great, but why was it only about 2 hours, couldn't they at least stretch it to 2 hours and 30 minute?I have no problem seeing a film that is 3 hours.It is so much stuff in these books that is left out, so much that also is funny and important part of the story. I think they should at least get minimum 2 1/2 hours of the next film and the last should be 3 hours or more. The last book I have just read, and it is so much stuff in it that is important, that I hope they make it 3 hours.This 5th in the series was very exiting, but I missed some stuff. But I hope they will make some DVD's after the whole series are made, with extended longer versions.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
It's as though all the happiness has gone from the world of Harry Potter...,"Must be the Dementors' fault.Having never read the books, I can't complain about things changed/left out and only judge the films on their own merits. I'd felt the series kept getting better, reaching its peak with 'Goblet of Fire', which I thought fonud the right balance between darkness/light-hearted fun. This film, however, I didn't find 'fun' at all. It got off to a bad start by including the loathsome Dursleys again (after blessedly skipping them in GoF). I also preferred how the last film started in the realm of magic, rather than the 'real world' like this one. Things didn't improve much when Harry was put on trial for using magic in front of his mush-mouthed cousin. Apparently magic trials are as boring as 'real world' trials. The only interesting parts to me were the visually stunning flight over the Palace of Westminster and the introduction of Nymphadora Tonks (who dislikes being called by her first name, judging by her tone/hair colour changing). Sadly, she disappeared after that. Mad-Eye Moody and Professor Lupin didn't fare much better, getting only small amounts of screentime.Things improved slightly with Ron, Hermione and the intriguing new character of Luna Lovegood. Evanna Lynch gave an exceptional performance, stealing every scene she was in (talking about Nargles and hoping for pudding). I especially liked her bonding with Harry over being 'different' along with skeletal horses called Thestrals that could only apparently be seen by those who'd seen death (makes you wonder how freaked out the others were when flying on them if they couldn't *see* them). Unfortunately, Harry was at his most unlikeable this film. Being moody/angry all the time might've been the *point*, but it certainly didn't make for fun viewing (though I shared his frustration with Dumbledore/understood his sudden outburst after getting sick and tired of seemingly being ignored by him). Ron and Hermione's characters seemed a bit more 'subdued' this film than how they'd been previously, thus making them feel quite different.Snape, who has felt underused for a while, got some focus when teaching Harry how to shield his mind from Voldemeort and it led to a flashback of young Snape being the victim of bullying from Harry's father, James. However, that doesn't excuse Snape's current attitude/behaviour towards Harry and his friends (talk about holding a grudge against the wrong people). While Lucius Malfoy gets his most screentime since the second film, this feels like the least amount of Draco we've seen. Meanwhile, we learn about the tragic fate of Neville's parents at the hands of the wickedly evil (and clearly insane, given the hair) Bellatrix Lestrange. When you need someone to play a nutter, get Helena Bonham Carter! She's quite fun, playing someone so evil. Sirius is back...but we don't get much time with him (nor does Harry, sadly).Seamus Finnigan's brief falling out with Harry (who insulted his mother) hasn't much impact; Ron's brothers bring some slight 'fun' to proceedings, poor Cho Chang gets very little screentime kiss with Harry comes seemingly out of nowhere. When their 'relationship' hits the rocks, all you can think is ""WHAT relationship?"" due to it being given minimal development. Professors McGonagall and Trelawney are also sorely underused. At the other end of the spectrum was the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, (seriously, do some background checks before giving people for that position!) Dolores Umbridge, who I felt had far too much screentime, zapping whatever fun was to be had out of every scene she was in. She's every super strict teacher ever...only *worse*, because she also abuses students by forcing them to write things over and over again with a magic quill that scratches what they're writing into their hands. How wasn't she immediately fired? Wizard logic!). She's the absolute WORST. What's a School of Witchcraft and Wizardry without magic? Pretty damn boring. If Imelda Staunton's performance is to be measured by how much I hated her character...then she gets top points.While it was nice to see the students going behind Umbridge's back and training for their oncoming 'war', as 'Dumbledore's Army', the sense of fun from the previous films was all but gone, I felt (the only part I really liked was seeing the various animals that the students' Patronus charms took the forms of). The first four films had this sense of wonder and blew your mind with the magical creatures and spells, etc. This movie was much more serious and had very little humour in it (and what humour it *did* have, I felt, more often than not fell flat). Some might like that fact, but to me, these films have always been about escapism and fantasy. Letting yourself be pulled into a world of magic and having a rollicking good time. As more and more of the real world merges with the magic world, we seem to be losing some of the more fantastical elements. Sure, there are spells cast in this movie, there's a dodgy CGI'd giant (the best part of that scene is Hermione showing it whose boss and Ron's protectiveness over her), there's duels involving wands (that more than slightly resemble the light-saber duels from the Star Wars films), there's centaurs and other things. I liked the 'Battle of the Department of Mysteries', and Dumbledore vs Voldemort allowed for some great visuals, but on the whole I just didn't feel the 'magic' this time around and that's why this is my least favourite film of the franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Magic,"I can still remember the thrill of reading my first Harry Potter book. I was slow starter - the first three books were already out by then. What made the books so enthralling was that the magic was presented matter-of-fact and without fanfare which made it at once seem all the more believable and more exciting. While I haven't disliked any of the films and actually enjoyed parts of all them, this is the first Harry Potter movie that made me feel the magic all over again. Yes, there will be a lot of complaints about what was left out, but what was put in was way more important. For the first time, parts of the film are actually subtle and give you pause for thought. A single glance conveys the information from many pages of text. The cast is as fine as usual, but Imelda Staunton (Delores Umbridge) is brilliant!",9.0,Anonymous,Action
surprisingly disappointing,"To begin with, Order of the Pheonix has been my favorite book so far. As i was reading it all I could do was imagine how awesome it was going to be on the screen! The whole plot is amazing, and exciting, perfect for a film version it seemed. Granted there would be much cut out, as it has been the longest book in the series so far, I was still looking forward to a crazy film. Needless to say I went into my screening of Harppy Potter at 4 o'clock the day after it came out and I was a little taken back. I thought over all it was pretty cool but so much was removed, parts that could and should have been added in if they just spent a little more time with it. The film was very rushed, the cuts between a few different scenes are so dramatic i wasn't sure if it really just happened or not. My boyfriend, who has not yet read the book, was unsure if a certain major incident near the end of the film even happened or not because of how abrupt the scene ended! And while I'm on the subject, the last scene could have been so INCREDIBLE! The last few chapters of the book are some of the most intense pages in all of the Harry Potter books combined, and it took the film about 5 minutes to show us. It would have been worth it all, had they taken like 30 extra minutes and actually elaborated the last scenes to what they needed to be. Basically, there were major plot holes- to a fan of the book anyway, pretty good acting- about as same as usual, although I felt like I didn't see Ron or Hermione much, but, that was due to how short the scenes were in order to pack the movie into just a few minutes over 2 hours. All and all, I did enjoy the film, I just think it was just too rushed and packed together to really do the book justice. They should have done a ""Kill Bill"" type movie, split it into two parts and released them separately. Maybe I need to go alert David Yates and let this little secret out, if the final book is going to be as big and intense as I hope. I know people are going to expect something crazy from that. Anyway, Let's just hope David Yates brings it next time, because he's in it for the long road and so am I.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
The Worst Movie So Far,"I'm a huge HP fan, and I realise the need to cut half the book down when the pages just keep on increasing - however, was it just me or do these movies keep getting worse and worse? #1 was good, #2 was worse, etc,etc? The sheer annoyance generated by OotP has prompted me to comment, which is completely unprecedented. From the first 2 minutes into the scene with Dudley and the Dementors, you realise how pathetic the acting really is - without any depth, sensibility or charisma - even though obviously, Dudley is meant to be a fat dumb a**, Daniel Radcliffe gets paid to grunt and nod his head every so often, or yell pointlessly at a wall? Jeez! I don't know, but maybe the first 2 minutes just turned me off for the rest of the movie, which suffered from poor direction - while I realise this film is meant to be dark and building up towards the mood for future films/books, the direction was mediocre and pretentious at best, evinced on many occasions throughout the film - you hope that while you are watching it, it will get better, except it does nothing but sink you deeper into the abyss of crapness.

Too much story to fit into a standard length movie,"This film was an okay bridge to the next sequence of events. I guess all readers feel sorry for those who have only ""seen the movie"" rather than read the books... More than ever I would encourage anyone with a slight interest in the books but no time or inclination to read the hefty tomes to LISTEN to them on CD or tape or MP3. There is no way they could give anything more than a fast sketch of events for the last 3 books. This one felt a little wooden in spots simply because the characters other than Harry were given so little time on screen to develop their characters. I still enjoyed it but unlike the previous Potter films I don't have a special desire to see it again. Alan Rickman is still totally hot :-)",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Not good at all...,"Well, what can i say? I'm not a huge fan of the franchise and haven't read a word of the books. This film was ultimately disappointing due to one major flaw. THE DIRECTOR! David Yates, of Merseyside. He?s apparently not really up to the job of handling(read more)a several million dollar budget. I haven't seen any of his other work but then i don't usually watch 'The Bill'. Bring back Chris Columbus, a much more capable director. Although a change of screenwriter probably didn't help things much either. The big effects scenes were marred by the director's insistence to cut away from the glorious special effects work at every opportunity! I can't understand his thinking, if you have huge budget special effects sequences why limit their time on screen? Shining through this incompetence are superb performances from Imelda Staunton as a delightfully evil and vicious Dolores Umbridge, and the usual impeccable stability from Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon and Gary Oldman along with a sadly under used Ralph Fiennes. The score was a bit over the top and didn't do enough to improve the depth and atmosphere of any scene. Only seeming to accentuate the awful direction. However, the sound design was superb; never overdone and perfectly judged. All in all not a good film at all. Unfortunately, I feel the producers are giving in to the needs of it's increasing adult audience (different covers for the books, WTF?) It should have been left where it was; an excellent children's fantasy adventure in the best traditions of British literature that adults can secretly enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
An overall improvement!,"Although the the general approach of this movie is quite similar to the others, like getting the story out in a short a time as possible, the outcome is quite different. The problem with the others is that it was very obvious where things had been removed, at least for fans of the books. But while watching this installment of the series, the plot sucks you in so much that you're hardly thinking about that. The direction was far better than the previous ones, a credit to Yates, who fully deserves to take a crack at the next movie. However, the greatest improvement is that of the acting! Finally all the main actors have fully embraced their roles, making you believe that they are none other than the actual characters themselves. In addition, the special effects were superb and the choreography of the fight scenes well mastered.

Err...No.,"I thought this was a good, solid movie. gotta agree that they've got progressively better, but thats not necessarily because of the acting. Let's face it, out of the 3 main characters: Ron, Hermione and Harry, only Ron can act. The other two are shockingly bad. Each film takes about 8/9 months to film, and they've done 5 of them. That's FIVE. How long does it take to get into character? Does Daniel Radcliffe have to look indecisive the WHOLE time; does Emma Thomson/Watson (can't quite remember) HAVE to look as if her brain is hurting ALL the time. It would be nice to have some sort of a semblance of reality from these two actors, mind you i thought Radcliffe acted well when he was being possessed by Ole' Voldy. Older actors were good, especially liked the choice for Bellatrix. But honestly. You could go into any theater and probably pick out better actors that Harry and Emma. In fact, try any school.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
The Fifth Movie,"To tell you the truth. I was very disappointed with the movie. I entire movie was rushed. There were some cool effects and Voldemort was freakin awesome but I just hate it when they change things in the movie that aren't even in the book. For instance, Neville finding the ""Room of Requirement"". We all now it was Dobby that told Harry about it. I know its small but to a True Harry Potter fan it's like a stab in the back when they do that. I also wish they put more stuff in the Ministry. I wish they added more of the Rooms and all that cool stuff. I love the fifth book and the screenwriter just freaked it all up. I hope that whoever writes the screenplay for the sixth book does it justice. I'm out!!!!!",,Anonymous,Action
nice one...,"i will have to agree with everybody, the film is actually good and I bow to the actors that so well performed. at last we have some justice with dumbledore's character.i have to say though... i understood from the beginning it would be a book very difficult to adapt due to it's length, but the only thing that i expected well done was the final part of the book, that is from the ministry of magic arrival on forwards.even though i liked the finale, there was so much excitement trimmed of... like the statues for instance...anyway... that really was the only thing that bothered me...good movie, great performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Brilliant - Near Perfect Adaptation!!!,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is currently my favorite book in the series. Having watched the film, I have to say, in my opinion the adaptation is near perfect. I was surprised that the director condensed such a long book into such a short movie. I feared the movie would be fast-paced like the opening scenes of Goblet of Fire. Order of the Phoenix is far from that, moving at an almost slow pace. The director successfully translated the dark tone of the books into film. He director artistically and masterfully crafts the film, rather than simply regurgitating the book as the first two films did. The movie feels almost claustrophobic, squeezing viewers into the tiny hallways of Grimmauld Place and presenting them with a Great Hall that seems not nearly as vast as in the first film. As the film differed from the book, I felt that almost all of the changes were justified and made for a better telling of the film on the screen. Overall, I was particularly impressed by the first and last scenes of the film. I recommend this film to fans of the books, and to older fans of the movies. I feel that small children may not enjoy this movie as much, since much of the light hearted hocus-pocus is absent from this dark installment.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
It's all in the detail...,"I decided to leave it a week or two after seeing Order of the Phoenix to let it level a little in my mind. Mainly because I was really disappointed after coming out the cinema and if I were to have written this review then, I think it would have given the wrong impression!I will also point out that I am an avid reader of the books. However, I only got into them very recently and so this is the first film version I have seen after reading the book (not the best way round I'm afraid). I wish I could have waited for the film to come out before reading the damm book but there you go, what's done is done!So to the reviewFirstly, the look of the film is pretty much what I imagined. There is of course large chunks of storyline taken out for timing reasons (though the film could have been 20 minutes longer, it would have made all the difference), but as to what is there, it looks good, it's fast paced and entertaining. The shots have the right amounts of darkness and mystery (though funnily enough not as dark as Azkaban) and the new characters (Umbridge, Bellatrix and Tonks) and places make the story grow with excitement of what's to come. What's missing is detail!Now I'm not saying that I expected to see the whole book transposed on to screen (it was a bloody big book) but there were certain things that were merely touched upon that should have had an extra few minutes, just to give the film clarity, rather than filling it with amusing montages of Filch and Umbridge giving children horrible detentions.On the good side, the child leads have also grown in appearance as well as acting ability (I had to keep reminding my friend how oooohing over the young Harry Potter was wrong in so many ways). Though to be honest the more I watch then the less I notice. Daniel is far better in this one and I've never had a problem with Ron. Hermione is still a little wooden but it never makes me as half as angry as watching Keira Knightly ""act"" so I'll get it pass!As for the rest of the cast, they are wonderful as usual and under used! But we should be used to this by know I guess. Luckily, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Emma Thompson, Robbie Coltrane, Michael Gambon and everyone I haven't named at Hogwarts are such gems of England; they steal every scene they are in, even if it's just a look (especially Rickman). The Hogwarts Staff are also joined my the elusive Order of the Phoenix, which along with most of the above names we are joined once again by Gary Oldman, David Thewlis and Brendon Gleason of the 3rd and 4th movies and regular sweethearts Julie Walters and Mark Williams, not to mention newbie Tonks played by Natalia Tena (barely introduced) who have re-banded together to raise an Army to fight Voldermort.But no one will tell Harry Potter anything. He's not heard from his two best friends all summer and now has been called in front of the Ministry because he used magic outside school, defending himself (and his cousin Dudley) from Dementors. Worst of all, the powers at the Ministry refuse to believe the Dark Lord is back, calling Harry a liar and they've sent a she-devil in the form of new Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher Dolores Umbridge to keep an eye out at Hogwarts.There's only one option left. Rebellion!I'm not saying there's anything wrong with Order of the Phoenix, it's an action packed, entertaining story and nearly everything that's stuffed into the 138 minute film is as I imagined. The acting is fantastic, praise to Imelda Staunton, it's exactly how I imagined she's be and the original story is there, I just hope that they've put enough of the detail in needed to explain it all when they finally make Half Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows!Still not the atmostphere of Azkaban but bloody entertaining! But looses marks on detail!",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Okay,"All those Harry Potter movies were just okay. The books were funny enough, and all the movie adaptations were decent and satisfying. I'm not a big fan of those book, but I liked them. Daniel Radcliffe was a very good choice as Harry Potter, he is very handsome and talented. The performances, the script and the special effects were good enough, not as good as better films as ""Avatar"" and ""Watchmen"", but were good. My only problem with all the Harry Potter films is that all of those movies are pretty long. Since those book and movies are aimed to children they should be shorter, I guess. All the Harry Potter films are good, but I still prefer ""Avatar"", because ""Avatar"" has aliens, and I love aliens.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Back To The Basics and how!,"OK, there was a hint of suspicion in the air since some press-critics had been longing for supposedly lost magic, but hey! - the magic was there and what the most: this is again a 'Harry Potter -movie'. 'Goblet' is fine film but as I stated my opinion earlier on it, it lacked the atmosphere that comes through when each movie recollects the events during the whole of Harry's year. 'Till this day 'Azkaban' was on the highest place in my ranking, but 'Feeniks' went just ahead. One reason is that 'Goblet' portrayed not so much Harry's year but what happened around the Tournament and as you might have guessed, I like it when the whole year is shown. Other important reason is how well this time some earlier images, scenes and events were put into use regarding especially movie as an art form. Obviously I must wait the DVD and then firmly decide which one tops the other - 'Feeniks' or 'Azkaban' - but already the series have leaped back to where it belongs: marvelous fantasy-film production of the century and the longing for 'Prince' is ever more aroused. And I guess I have to line up for 'Hollows' Saturday morning so I may read how it ends - first time in English; have been waiting the translations so far.Happy Potters, everybody!",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Order of the Phoenix Not True to the Book,"You can tell that the screenplay writer, Greenberg could NOT have thoroughly read and digested the previous 4 stories. While the movie was good on its own, it omitted potentially entertaining and vital scenes from the book. Most notably were the numerous exchanges in the book between McGonagall and Umbridge, the swamp spell perpetrated by the Weasley twins, and the animosity between Umbridge and the Centaurs. And Firenze was totally omitted as the replacement for Trelawny! OMG, how could THAT be?? I'm relieved that Steve Kloves is doing the screenplay for Half-Blood Prince. The integrity of the overall storyline SHOULD be restored with the return of Kloves' writing talent. As others have said, while I'm a fanatical fan of the series, Order of the Phoenix was the least successful transition of book to film.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Lessons learned.,"""What makes Harry and buds more interesting than ever is that they care more deeply about each other and take more time to figure out their strategies, the way intelligent adults do."" So I said about the third Harry Potter installment, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. I can't say that for the fifth, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which uses much elementary wizardry and too little caring, except for Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) ambivalent kiss with Cho Chang (Katie Leung), in honor of diversity, I suppose.The tone is downbeat as Harry tries to prepare the skeptics for the return of his arch enemy, Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). It may be that Harry is becoming more isolated because of his fame (newspapers pronounce him ""Harry Plotter""), distancing himself from his friends partly to shield them from collateral harm and partly from adolescent moodiness.There is little fun of the kind the Quidditch match, missing here, always provided. Harry is even opposite and distant from Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) as he is consumed by his thoughts about the return of his enemy. Happily some joy comes in a makeshift classroom, where Harry experiences the gift of inspiring teaching, his own teaching, that is.Harry's teaching antithesis is new villainess Dolores Umbridge (Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton), whose style is to dictate theory without experience, to demand learning without reason, and to eschew practical magic in general. Her pink outfit is almost a joy in such a grey world and a nicely ironic juxtaposition to her distinctly unfeminine behavior. The splash of color is memorable and dramatically spot on.Some universals apply such as the value of going it on your own and learning well. The lesson about the value of experience joined with theory is a high point in an otherwise dark, action-filled, second-rate Potter production.",,Anonymous,Action
The best Harry Potter flick by far,"If you are an avid Harry Potter reader, then you'll definitely love the movie. Adherence to the book was satisfied to a good extent although some characters were omitted(as usual).Even little elements like the thestrals flying over the forest was covered promptly.This movie wasn't dark as the previous two but significantly, it was silent and more thoughtful.The performance by Imelda Staunton(Dolores Umbridge in the movie) is unbeatable. Kudos to her for the sheer villainy portrayed by her character (or rather she lived her character in the movie).The movie however lacked the little funny element of the book.Dumbledore's Army and the sessions where Harry teaches his friends is very good. Evanna Lynch suited Luna Lovegood to a tee.The scenes of the wizard duels in the climax were really wonderful treat for the eyes.Michael Gambon's (Dumbledore) part can be well described by the following words of one of the characters,Kingsley Shacklebolt(Played by George Harris)-""He's got style!"". And the favorite trio of the series grow closer with this movie.Ron (Rupert Grint) however could've been used more effectively. No quidditch scenes in this movie and so he missed his chance to impress the audience. Sirius Black's (Gary Oldman) part was very serious and was totally justified.Hats off to Gary Oldman.His house elf Kreacher,however had no role at all,with only two instances of appearing on screen.Coming to Harry's First kiss - well.. no comments about that.The Ministry of Magic was a delightful set indeed and the climax was well planned and executed.The final meeting between Harry and Dumbledore could've been a little longer and more interesting.It would've seriously made a difference.And the background music was totally insufficient.It was silent for most of the movie.Overall, this is the best of the five movies and I daresay a very good one indeed.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Fantastic film!,"Just saw Order of the Phoenix, and I thought David Yates did a brilliant job of translating Jo Rowling's book to the screen. Love the set design, and the acting was excellent. Imelda Staunton was perfect at the despicable Umbridge, as was Helena Bonham Carter in a tiny role as Bellatrix. Harry has become a bit of a lost soul in this movie, and Dan Radcliffe does an outstanding job of portraying him--he's really coming along as an actor. This is definitely the best movie of the series. I particularly liked that David Yates wasn't afraid cast off the tendency some of the earlier films had (Prisoner of Azkaban excepted) to portray the magical world in a very twee sort of way, and instead created a grown-up vision of magic--something that can be exciting but also hugely powerful and frightening. Can't wait to see what he does with Half Blood Prince.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Absolutely incredible!,"This was one of the first times, that I've been so engrossed that my over-thinking brain didn't try to analyze the correctness of the movie to book. It was absolutely engrossing, charming and fun. High energy. I loved every minute of it. I did wish some parts were expanded a bit but I was thrilled with the outcome. Especially after the slight feeling of disappointment with the others.Imelda Staunton does a superb job of Professor Umbridge but overall I would have to say that Evanna Lynch does an absolutely fantastic job as Luna Lovegood. She was incredible. I was a tad bit worried before watching the film but she absolutely blew me away.I won't include any spoilers because thats how the end of the 6th book was ruined for me.

Completely out of order,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a step up from Goblet of Fire but it's still a disappointing film as a Harry Potter film and especially compared to the first 3, it's a film with one of the slowest and messiest first 2 acts I've ever seen, with some of the most annoying character additions and an ending that really elevates it, almost every idea this film introduces is forgotten about.I will say, Daniel Radcliffe is great in this film along with Gary Oldman, with one of the saddest deaths in this world and great character development for Harry Potter and it even got me to care about Neville, which I didn't expect to happen, but with all this said, it's a messy, slow, and poorly written film that still is a disappointment.I'm gonna give Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix a C+",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Overall a wonderful adaptation,"Let's face it. The entire book was never going to fit into a two-a-a-half hour long movie. People are complaining that there are so many aspects of the novel missing, and although I do have a few complaints, I think it was well written enough, and it was definitely very entertaining.For some reason Steve Kloves decided not to adapt this movie, but I think Michael Goldenberg does a fine job. The movie is essentially propelled forward by a series of montages, that David Yates does a good job with, and which are accompanied by great scores from Nicholas Hooper, whose music overall was very fitting.The acting, obviously, was excellent. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are getting better every time now, and some others in the younger cast, such as Matthew Lewis, James and Oliver Phelps, Bonnie Wright, and, making her film debut appearance, Evanna Lynch, all did a great job.The rest of the cast was amazing, which they are every time. Ralph Fiennes is even better as Lord Voldemort, and Imelda Staunton was absolutely brilliant as Professor Umbridge. Additionally, Gary Oldman, Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Helena Bonham Carter, and Alan Rickman do a great job. Also, Emma Thompson, although only in the movie for about five minutes or so, gives and exceptional performance as Professor Trelawney.The only complaint I have is, and this is somewhat confusing, but the running time for this movie is only 2 hours and 19 minutes, which is long, but not for a Harry Potter movie. They removed the scene where Harry and the others visit the hospital, and many scenes in the department of mysteries. I understand that these might've been expensive to film, but it's not as if they have any lack of money, and these would've added greatly to the film.Overall, though, this is a fantastic movie that, although it does waver from the book, does a great job at getting all the important parts in. It flows fluidly with great direction from David Yates, and is definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
loved it!,"This was by far the most amazing of all Harry Potter movies! I want to see it again! I loved Imelda Staunton's character; i thought she was really funny and she gave me a laugh or two. Also, i admired Helen Bonham Carter, i think the way in which she acted her small part was fantastic, a real standout for me! I'm a little disappointed with Ron and Hermione in relation to how important they are in the film. This film seems to have pushed them a bit to the back, and they don't seem as involved as they used to be in previous films. I loved the Department of Mysteries battle scene; although short, i thought it was unbelievable. The magic in it, the sounds, all of it made me excited. I recommend this movie for anyone, although i believe it essential to read the book before watching, it makes it so much more entertaining.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

Disappointing,"I won't write a long scenario as to why I was disappointed in this film due to the fact that I haven't ready any of the books in the HP series.As a fan of the HP movies; however, there was so much to be desired. I walked into this film with such HIGH expectations to only be let down!! The scenes were too choppy! Although, now that the young wizards and witches are growing up it is cool to see a darker side to the HP film series. However, I would liked to have seen a much better edited version of Film #5.Despite my disapproval and disappointment of this film, I still would recommend any HP fan to go see this movie -- don't cheat yourself out of an HP experience just because the ratings aren't the best.No matter how the HP film turns out to be like it is very difficult to cram a huge plot into a 2.5 hour film. My advice to the producers -- give better direction for the next two films --- make them the best ever. Do HP some great justice!!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Saving the series,"After the fourth film, I had decided I would skip the remainder and move on with my life. I liked what the films had done, liked the cast, and the production was always first rate, but the feeling on my part was ""so what?"" I found myself wishing Rawlings had stopped at five books. I no longer felt involved.Happily I can say I was completely wrong. A few weeks ago, I began to hear buzz that this film was very good indeed. And the reviews on the well-known movie review site were remarkably positive, so I decided to give it try. I am sure glad I did. This films works, there is real danger and conflict, and the actors, old friends and new, rise to the occasion. It is a movie with children, not a children's movie. ""Teenage adults,"" I probably should say.As always the world of HP is beautifully realized and the new characters are fully developed and fit in perfectly. In the case of the new head-mistress of the defense against the black arts, the monster is as loathsome as can be. There is still plenty of humor in the movie, but it is humor with a bite. This is probably the most ruthlessly satirical of the films (so far) and well-worth seeing more than once. People who complained about POTC:AWE may well complain about this one too as it gets fairly complex who is doing what to whom, but the pacing never flags and the ride is well-worth it.Particularly interesting is newcomer Evanna Lynch as ""Luna Lovegood,"" a traumatized character who seems at first will just be played for cruel humor, but comes into her own as a fighter fully worthy of the Order of the Phoenix. This is a wonderful film debut and certainly offers promise of her going on to do great things.I even found myself wishing it had been longer. This movie definitely saves the series and primes us for the final two films. Now, I can hardly wait to see them. Great job to all concerned, especially the director.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix rolling around in its grave,"It was by far the most disappointing movie-related experience of my life. I wouldn't even go as far as saying that this film was movie based. It was, perhaps, inspired by a book, who knows.The storyline is rushed and empty. They cut off everything relevant to the plot, and leave everything that's due to impress those who have not read the books in.They INVENT passages, just to fit in some of the extremely over the top special effects they want to impress us with. That's just underestimating the public.Not only did they cut many great stuff out, they changed almost every scene. It was like they were trying to show things you get the feeling of after reading the whole book in about thirty seconds, so they had to do it super-obvious for it to show. Most scenes felt ridiculous, over the top and childish.And, the plot being so rushed, you can't get inside the story, not even remotely in the same way as with the books. I felt like a million miles away, and left the cinema utterly disappointed.Sure, they made tons of money, but at the cost of murdering a great book, a book in which the Harry Potter series goes from being great, interesting, kids novels about a boy with magical powers, to be an excellent series for all ages, that sure, dwells on the topic of magic, but that is also about human relationships, the characters' personalities, and teenagers' feelings. The book with more character development in the series, and you barely get to hear their names. Absolutely NO character development, but oh sure, they find time for all those irrelevant passages with a shot at winning them a prize for special effects.Dumbledore's character, again, immensely disappointing, but that we are used to by now. You don't even get the glimpse of the absolutely calm, cold-headed and love-is-the-most-important-magic-of-all Dumbledore. Michael Gambon should read the books ASAP if he wants to continue portraying this magnificent character.The only plus of this movie is the casting, which I thought was excellent. Luna was absolutely amazing, everything I had imagined and expected. Bellatrix was also pretty good, and Daniel was surprising. There are a couple of scenes that left me awe-struck.Overall, I would say that calling this movie Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is false advertising.",1.0,Anonymous,Action
Potter Pots Gold,"Let me start this review off by saying that I am a Harry Potter fanatic, at sixteen years old I'm at the perfect age to truly appreciate the series. I started to reading the books when they first came out and I was instantly hooked, I think I was about six or seven when the original book came out, and now ten years on and now five of the seven movies have been made and the final (and in my eyes best) book has just been released. So in short I have grown up with this series, and in some respects the characters have grown up with me. However, in my opinion I always found Order of the Phoenix to be the weakest book of the series. Sure its still brilliant and has its moments, but after the high of Goblet of Fire I just felt Order was lacking something truly magic. It seemed overlong, a bit boring and just filling in the gaps until the final two books. I was expecting Order of the Phoenix to be the weakest movie as a result of this, however due to a great bit of cutting out the unnecessary bits of the book, Order of the Phoenix ends up being in my eyes the very best Potter movie to date! Now I also understand this will be a bit controversial with many people watching the movie, as I was sitting watching this I realised that if you are not a fan of the books or have not read the books I wasn't certain those people would truly appreciate the film. In some respects Order of the Phoenix is the most fan friendly of the series and doesn't rely on an overdose of CGI like the other movies. This one actually has a hell of a lot of talking going on, in fact up until the huge fight in the Ministry of Magic, there isn't a whole lot of action at all. What Phoenix does instead is develop interesting characters, show the plot to its full potential and deliver some great moments in the series.So lets start off with the acting, now throughout the Potter series we have seen the lead three, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint develop before our eyes. In Philosopher's Stone the three were annoying. Emma Watson just about got away with it, Rupert Grint made me laugh a couple of times so I never really found him to be awful. But Daniel Radcliffe was eye gougingly awful. Since Philosopher's Stone, in each and every movie we've seen the leads get better and better, until now we see them improve yet again and actually become very good. Daniel Radcliffe impressed me most this time around, for once I saw the Harry Potter I wanted to see. You really got a sense of his inner struggle and his confused emotions. His character finally got the room to develop and we saw what Harry Potter should be like. Ron and Hermione are a bit sidelined and so I can't really comment too much on them. The adults this time get to shine as well. Imelda Staunton is the epiphany of evil as Dolores Umbridge, she's exactly as I visualised her in the book, and to be blunt she's a complete and utter cow. But she's a great cow and I can't wait to see her return in the future films. Gary Oldman finally got the opportunity to shine as Sirius Black, he was sadly wasted in Goblet of Fire, but here he gets some great moments with Harry. Alan Rickman gets some great scenes, but for fans of the books they are all waiting for that one moment in Half Blood Prince with Snape. The rest of the actors all do perfectly, special note must go to Evanna Lynch who is pitch perfect as Luna Lovegood.As I have previously mentioned Order of the Phoenix lacks the huge set pieces that Goblet of Fire gave to us in the forms of the Triwizard trials. This time its pretty much about the school itself and how Umbridge is slowly taking over, its also a bit about rebellion in the form of Dumbledore's Army. The big set piece takes place at the end in the Ministry of Magic, and boy is it brilliant. For those who wanted to see wizards fight, they shall not be disappointed. The big final fight between Dumbledore and Voldemort will have fans sitting on the edge of their seats, that moment is huge. There are also moments of brilliance to be found in the Occlumency lessons which were very well done, the Weasley twins invasion of the OWL's, a tense Dementor attack and any moment where Umbridge wanders round being as nasty as hell.Order of the Phoenix comes out as one of the best movies of the summer so far and also the best Potter movie to date. Its fast paced, got a great climax, a nice bit of drama to keep things going and also some very funny moments. I can't wait to see director David Yates interpretation of Half Blood Prince which is a much better book than Phoenix. If he keeps to how he did it here we should get a very dramatic and intense movie. Of course fans of Potter won't like this, but people who aren't fans of Potter generally just pretend to hate it more than they actually do so. For people who are fans of the books or movies they will lap this up intently and be sitting and waiting for the next two movies to arrive.",10.0,Anonymous,Action

"Horrible ,Awful, Bad.","This is worst Harry Potter movie out of all of them !I could go on forever of the quantity of plot-holes in this film ! It was horrible I was cringing the whole entire movie . They did not explain anything ! Daniel Radcliffe's performance was utterly poor which I did not expect because he had done well in the other movies . They left out so much of the book . Like yes I know the book is about 700 pages long BUT why make such a horrible adaptation of it ? Why couldn't David Yates make the movie longer ? I don't understand.I'm so sad because of that Weasley scene . It was horrible !! The Weasley scene was so important and I was waiting for the line ""Give her hell , for us Peeves "" BUT NO, the Weasley twins just did some lame fireworks and left , just like that . I was furious .David Yates just thinks that the Weasley twins are just comical relief but they are so much more than that !And also what happened to Quidditch??There was completely no scene of Quidditch , did it just disappear ?Quidditch is essential in every Harry Potter film , I was anticipating for the Ron being picked on and the ""Weasley is our King"" song BUT NO that didn't happen either.And once again I was furious!What kind of giant was Grawl ? It literally looked like it was 7 feet tall . Harry and Hermione were calm at seeing this giant and Grawl was educated and calm which is really hard to believe because I'm pretty sure no giant would act like that .Kreacher was like in 1 scene , when Kreacher is quite important in the book ! Oh and don't get me started on Sirius where the heck was the connection of him and potter you just could't see it in the movie and that made me really mad they really messed up there.Everything was bad or lame and I didn't like this movie at all",6.0,Anonymous,Action
The blockbuster of this summer,"I had the luck to view the preview show yesterday for this great movie. A great treat for harry potter fans. The director has brilliantly tried to stitch in all pieces of the plot of the huge fifth book of harry potter and is wonderfully successful to get it done in this 2 hour movie.If you have watched recently any of the earlier parts, you get to realize how the actors are growing older and may become a spoiler in the next coming parts. But also you cannot stop noticing the acting skills of these actors have matured too.This part has been a bit different from the earlier parts- very less broom rides, more wand fights. The movie is filled with quite a few funny moments that brings cheer across the whole audience and a couple times applause. It doesn't make a difference if you have read the book, this movie will still bring you to the corner of your seats.Timed well with the release of the next book, this movie is on its way to become the best blockbuster of the summer. Don't buy popcorn for this movie, you would not need it, as you will be so engrossed in the movie. This is a ""must watch"" movie for every one who has eyes.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
From a reader's point pf view...,"Let's put it this way, this movie was very good. However, there's SO much more they could've done with it. I do realize they had to condense such a huge book into a 2 hour movie, but they left out way too much for MY liking. I felt it was more rushed than it should've been. Those who have read the book will know what I mean when they watch the movie. At the end of the movie I was conflicted: How could JK Rowling say this was the best of the Harry Potter movies when they left out such a large amount of significant details from the book? Don't get me wrong I really like this movie, but I was expecting much better.Quick Notes Story: 6/10 (a lot left out) Acting: 8/10 (great performances) Direction: 7/10 (could've done much better) Visuals: 9/10 (stellar special effects, sets, etc.)Final Grade: 7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Action
A great return in the series,"After a very bad 4th movie in my opinion, this 5th movie brought my interest back to Harry Potter. At most times very closely following to the book, the movie brings a great life back to the series. The acting improved tremendously, though of course could be improved more (Daniel acted SO much better this time around). The set I couldn't say anymore of, after the 3rd movie modified the set to such a scale it has kept it up perfectly. While the 4th movie cut out a lot of information and scenes, much of which fans wanted, this movie includes most of the key points and included the much awaited Voldemort vs Dumbledore fight in the Ministry. The special effects have been seemingly cranked up a notch since the last time.I suggest this movie be watched by all Potter fans, especially those who did not like the 4th film.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Decent Readers' Digest Version (but Bring Back Columbus and Continuity Checkers!),"Potter fans rejoice (if only moderately): the latest installment in the film saga comes closer to the high standard of film adaptation set by the *first* two films than the last two over praised ""mooovie-movies,"" even if in the slapdash ""best of the highlights"" approach the latest director takes (despite attention lavished on the big fight scenes near the end), we only have a decent Readers' Digest Potter with the bones of the plot and little if any of the motivations or substance - or even locations we have come to know and love.The ubiquitous argument about how ""radical editing"" was unavoidable given the 875 page original book is essentially a nonsense. The problem is not that so many plot lines were shorn (they were, but by in large that's OK and not the reason the film doesn't totally satisfy), but that the core story is so sloppily told with so little care to motivations.The movie assumes that most of the audience knows the story and will forgive story changes which will allow the director to delete characters (Dobby for instance) yet stick some characters (Kreacher) in for a scene or two but omit the only REASONS they were in the BOOK in the first place.Not to give away plot revisions, which are in fact relatively minor - ranging from who proposed the use of ""The Room of Requirement"" to who exposes its use (a particularly nasty change), to how the supply of ""Veritas Serum"" is supposedly used (or the missing explanation necessary as a result of the change as to why it didn't work) - but a simple list of what is left OUT of the movie from the book (details which need NOT have taken significant screen time if any additional at all - NOT major sub-plots) may serve as warning against disappointment:*The coaches which the Thestrals pull (they're mere dogcarts now). *Quiddich (playing or bans even referred to). *Confiscation of brooms (requiring alternate transportation to distant points). *Lessons (of any kind except in the D.A.!). *House Elves (except for two brief, non-plot appearances from ""Kreacher""). *The Invisibility Cloak. *The Marauders' Map. *Pensives. *St. Mungo's. *Ghosts AND poltergeists. *Cleaning of the Headquarters of the Order. *The *concept* of ""Secret Keeper"". *The Hour Glasses and the House Point system (why not, since they omitted the scoring from the contests in ...Goblet of Fire!?) *Dumbledore's Office (and access to it or lack thereof). *How the D.A. was named (or how Umbridge heard about it). *The enchanted Galleons communication system (or any substitute). *Any explicit blockage/monitoring of student communication including the Flue Network and Owls! *The Quibbler *Any censorship of outside publications. *Umbridge's racism (or WHY her actions against the centaurs are so provocative). *Attacks on Hagrid AND/OR McGonagall *Outside O.W.L. examiners. *Why Filch likes Umbridge so much. *Any hint as to why Neville may be such an important character - or might have been even MORE important. *Magical swamps. *ANY attacks on Umbridge at all or student resistance to her regime (except at the *one* time Rowling specifically made it clear the Weasley's at least would NOT - when it would interrupt important student activities - specifically when they are sitting for O.W.L. exams!) *The elimination of *any* member of the Order of the Phoenix from Hogwart's grounds *except* Dumbledore so there was a REASON Harry couldn't call on them for assistance in a crisis. *Who MADE ""the prophesy,"" why it is important & why it is a secret. *How the Dementors came to BE in Little Wingins. *Any celebration of Umbridge's departure (her *rescue* is not even mentioned) and most stunning of all, *HARRY'S SCAR* (it literally isn't ON his forehead until it makes one brief, suddenly darkly drawn in appearance late in the movie)!OK, readers may well wonder how they COULD tell the story without these things (except for the final fight scene, this film eliminates more actual MAGIC from Hogwarts than Umbridge does!), but still, over all the film works. Rowlings provided a rattling good allegory of right wing governmental repression.Imelda Staunton's Umbridge is an evil joy to behold (even if her best scenes were eliminated), and Evanna Lynch's sublime Luna Lovegood is a true find (even if the REASON for her character to be IN the book - her publisher father - has also been eliminated). Most of the student cast is growing wonderfully into their roles - from the three leads to (especially) Neville Longbottom.The utterly silly (frequently noisy!) plot changes surrounding The Room of Requirement or even the astoundingly stupid and time wasting taking down of all the portraits on the Hogwart's walls can't undercut what remains a fast moving fun story for reader and non-reader alike. Those who know the book will be aware how much better this movie could have been. Those who don't won't have to worry too much about it - despite the odd plot line left hanging and action curiously unmotivated - director Yates keeps things spinning along so swiftly, most won't notice 'till long after the interminable crawl at the end is a distant memory.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Harry reborns from ashes (dvd),"Before his lame three future movies of HP, Yates delivers at last one good movie! First, the movie benefits from the excellent story of the eponymous book. It's not that i don't like the others but after this one, HP turns into private Potter and wizardry becoming war isn't my cup of tea. Here, they are still students and it's really their last one when they look still childish. Next, there's a great addition of new characters: Evanna is as eerie as Luna and Nat/Tonks directed a very funny making-of in the extras. But only the books will give you a deep view into them because in the movie, they are only fly over. I don't forget Dolores Umbridge who teaches a good lesson for audience: bad, mean people can look sweet and gentle! The trio faces a interesting evolution as well: Harry lacks patience and shows anger while Hermione and Ron are really true friends, accepting him as he is. So, it's really about helping each other and not fighting. The production and sets are beautiful, especially the Ministry. Its gloomy and mazing architecture recalls ""Brazil"" and above all, the entire movie is fortunately not salvaged by a poor cinematography. In conclusion, it's a vivid, full-colored phoenix that we got there!",7.0,Anonymous,Action
By Far The Best Harry Potter Film!,"I'm NOT a Harry Potter fan! The previous films I found to be a combination of either annoying, dull, confusing, or in last Harry Potter film - very disturbing. But they finally got one right - Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is thoroughly entertaining! It stands on its own. It has depth. And, you don't need to know a thing about the Harry Potter storyline in order to enjoy it!After leaving the theater, it dawned on me that this story is truly from a European perspective. Anyone in Europe who has lived through War World 2 knows first hand what a powerful monster (dictator) can do to a society. It's not an abstraction, like it is for the vast majority of Americans. While Lord Voldemort is physically portrayed as a devil, what he really is is a very powerful war lord. One that would be only to happy to destroy any person, group of persons or institutions that stand in his way of absolute power. He exists for no other reason. He's not after wealth or glory, just raw power!There's even a Neville Chamberlin character in this rather clever film. He and his allies are so blind to the obvious threat of war that they undermine everything they profess to hold dear. They are so arrogant and foolhardy they become caricatures of sheer stupidity.There is so much good that can be extracted from this story - what it means to a leader, that wisdom can come from the most unlikely of places, the importance of planning ahead, there is strength in numbers, don't always believe what you read, improvise in a crisis, help can come when you least expect it!I have high hopes for the final Harry Potter film. If Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is any indication of what is to come - I wait with great anticipation!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
I wish I hadn't read the book first,"maybe I would have enjoyed this movie.I will start by saying that I have thoroughly loved and enjoyed the first 4 HP films. I have read the first 5 books and am currently racing to finish the 6th in time for next Friday. That being said, our whole family was so disappointed in this film. My husband (who didn't read the book) said there was no ""magic"" to this film. My 10 year old son (the H-P fanatic) said this was the worst HP movie (where was the brain room and all the other things that happened in the Dept. of Mysteries?). I felt the story was disjointed. Previous movies hadn't felt the need to make major changes to the plot, why start now? I know it's a long book, I know it needed to be condensed, but it could have been done so much better.I think the writers need to write lines for punishment!",6.0,Anonymous,Action
'Phoenix' Casts Its Spell,"SYNOPSIS: Harry Potter and co. discover The Order of the Phoenix, a secret society bent on stopping the Dark Lord's reign of terror. Meanwhile, the students of Hogwarts grapple with an oppressive new female teacher, Dolores Umbridge. PROS: This is quite simply the film of the summer. Director David Yates fits this series like a glove. He pulls no punches when delivering the darker aspects of the story, but makes sure to add plenty of humor and heart as well. The cast is uniformly excellent as usual. Old hands like Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson are note-perfect in their roles, while newcomers like Evanna Lynch and Helena Bonham Carter deliver memorable performances as well. Deserving special mention is Imelda Staunton, who plays Dolores Umbridge, a perky professor with dark political motivations. In a film with a cast for the ages, she steals the show. The behind the scenes crew isn't slacking off either-cinematography, music, and special effects are all leaps and bounds ahead of the previous Potter films. And screenwriter Michael Goldenberg trims the fat of the 870-page book, leaving us with a lean, mean, emotional roller-coaster of a film. CONS: No huge qualms. Sure, some fan favorites (Dobby) are dropped, but when you have a book this big, who cares. My only really (very small) problem with the film is that the Mr. Weasley subplot could have used a bit more time. Overall, the best of all five Potter flicks, and a fantasy film on par with The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. David Yates is the best thing ever to happen to the HP series. Bravo.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Great Movie,"This is movie is going to blow everything else out of the water this summer. I loved this movie, the 2+ hours went by quickly as the movie keep a quick pace,at no point did I feel as if they were just dragging the movie out. The Order of the Phoenix, is a movie that all will enjoy. I think even people who haven't seen the previous, four movies will be able to enjoy this one. I can't wait until the next one hit the screens. J.K.R. is a great writer, as we progress in her stories they seam to get better and better and when they conclude I think that we will be able to say that this has been among the very best series of books and movies ever. Go out and see this movie as soon as you can, and if you haven't seen the last four go out and rent them and then go and see the Order of the Phoenix.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
so not the best,"i have no doubts that the director of this movie is a good director at other things but as far as this movie goes it isn't the best yet it was put together terribly and left out many things that some may find important to the plot most say it was because they didn't want the movie to be too long they just had to put in the important stuff and yes if u had never read the books you would not have noticed but most fans have and it was sickening to me that they would leave out so much, true fans would have set through any harry potter movie even if it was 3 hours long so saying he has made the best one yet is far from the truth i find it revolting that people would think it was yes it had more magic than the others but as far as giving you the whole story its the worst one yet i am a big fan and have read all the books many times and every time i saw them skip over something even something small i just wanted to walk out of the theater so for him being a great director i cant argue with that but as far as this being the best one yet you are strongly mistaken",,Anonymous,Action
Exactly how I hoped it would be!,"Now, the fifth book was, by far, my favorite of the series, so expectations were somewhat high for the movie. I'm actually glad to say that I left with a smile on my face.Again, Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson return as the trio of protagonists at Hogwarts, delivering average acting back to the screen. Rupert and Emma will definitely never win an Oscar anytime too soon, but Daniel is getting pretty good at portraying the infamous angst-filled Potter everyone complained about in the fifth book. He pulls off the character as a whole rather well.The ensemble is amazing, as usual for a Harry potter film, but two new characters really stood out to me this time around: Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood) and Imelda Staunton (Delores Umbridge). I was overjoyed to see my two favorite characters from the fifth book portrayed so perfectly. Umbridge is, by far, the most evil villain that has ever graced the Harry Potter screen. Audience members hated her so much, flicked her off whenever she was on screen, yelled out obscenities whenever she punished a Hogwarts student. That's the exact response I wanted her to get, because that's the response I gave her while reading the book! Kudos to Imelda for bringing to life one of the nastiest villains that we all love to despise. Evanna played Luna exactly how I hoped she would: that weird little girl who nobody would talk to because she's so weird, but has an amazing heart that's always in the right place. I'm really glad that they both pulled off their characters so well.It is dark, definitely the darkest in the series so far, but there are many light-hearted moments (Harry talking to Ron and Hermione about his first kiss, for example). It follows the book exactly, which also relieved me. Sure, they cut some things out, but it hardly fazed me. The story flowed well and stuck as much to the original novel as it could've.To me, this is how a Harry Potter movie should always be. Very, very well done. 10-10 stars for a Harry potter movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
A good adaptation of the worst book.,"The director, in my view, had a very good go at adapting this book for the screen, as it is (in my opinion) the worst book. I can't really comment on the plot twists as I knew what was going to happen anyway, but it was very well acted by both the child actors (Luna Lovegood being the standout actor - head and shoulders above the rest) and the adult actors. Umbridge was perfect as the auntie who'd rip your head off and then worry about the blood stain and Helena Bonham Carter was also very good as Lestrange. Some actors let the side down (in my opinion Daniel Radcliffe overacted although everyone else made up for this with their performances). Overall, a very well acted piece and a pretty reasonable adaptation of the source material.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
"Less awesome than the previous two, maintains the high level","With an admirable effort to condense all the essential to make the shortest Harry Potter movie yet, but still finding the time to develop both intertwined plots (Harry maturing as a man and Good vs. Evil)The pace is great. The darker tone of the story is match with way more intense scenes than the previous movies. his helped us to feel as oppressed as the characters were (some might dislike this).The ideas expressed were expertly delivered: use of power vs. abuse of power; law vs. tyranny; education vs. instruction; friendship and colaboration vs. selfish sociopathy.The acting is naturally more interesting with now the older protagonists, but that was about to happen. And the clear weakness of the worst score of the five first movies, its compensated with the major and best use of magic.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
If i hadn't of read the books I might have been inclined to really like the movie,"While I don't think it was a bad movie, I think after reading the book I had too many expectations for the movie to be just as good. I feel that for a movie that ran as long as it did, there was ample time to go more in depth about some of the more important parts of the book that were left out or altered altogether. I feel some of the biggest issues could have been a more involved development of why umbridge was the way she was and her disdain for non-humans, harry's confusion and sympathy for snape and doubt about his father and sirius' actions as students, and even the down played roles of jenny and luna. i could go on and on but those are some of the things that bothered me most after seeing the movie",,Anonymous,Action
Disappointed,"New director ruined the movie. That says it all. Yes, the book was way too big to bring it fully to the screen, it lacked action and contained too many intrigues and political nuances. It was hard to screen, but I'm sure, doable. Why not Mr. Columbus? Why not Mr. Cuaron? Why, at least, Mr. Newell, who's dark and depressive, but still whole and logical adaptation of the fourth book was quite watchable? But this, I-don't-know-who director, that has no big experience..His movie looks torn apart. Cutting is awful. For viewer, unfamiliar with the book, events are odd and happening without order and logical connection between them. Such an ""Blair Witch"" effect in all. Special effects stepped down (remember, for example, talking through chimney with Sirius now and before).Having watched all movies in a row, I stumbled upon last - like beautiful ladder suddenly ended with a missing footstep.

"Darker, Moodier But Rushed!","Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is a great movie, no doubt about that. The only thing that went wrong is the how the movie was adapted from the novel. Many action-packed scenes were left out. Any way, Harry goes for Year 5 at Hogwarts and he must endure the hateful Umbridge and teach some students magic that Umbridge refuses to teach. The acting in this film is the best. Radcliffe did a good job showing Harry's emotions from the book. Everyone else was good as well. The technical aspects(cinematography, camera work etc) of the film is fantastic. The score is not that bad. Hooper put together a nice piece of work. There should've been more scenes that were in the book including Quidditch(Weasley Is A King, Fight with Malfoy), the Rita Skeeter interview, and the explosive anger towards Dumbledore. Other than that, this is a good film. I rate this film a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Disappointing...,"First of all, I think it's stupid and unfair to label fans as ""disappointed"" only because the movie isn't 10 hours long and it doesn't match the book word-by-word. I'm a fan of the books and I've enjoyed the movies so far. Goblet of Fire was faithful enough and had good pace and a great finale. For some reason ""Order of the Phoenix"" which is the longest book of the series, has less 20 minutes than GoF and has a lot more content and characters. Too much stuff happens and Harry is probably the only character with more than 5 lines of text. There are a lot of holes in the plot, needless changes from the book (Sirius' scene... why?) and a sense of rush that prevents you from enjoying the best parts. Umbridge was great as well as Luna, but Dumbledore continues to be a completely different character from the book. It's a shame that Michael Gambon didn't even bother to read the books, cause Dumbledore is obviously a key character in the series. It's great to see HP in the screen but if you've read the book you can't help but feel disappointed, especially cause it could've been a much better film with another 20 minutes and less changes from the book.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Disapoited,"While in my opinion ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is the second best book and second best movie in the series. What was disappointing was the identity of the traitor of the location where ""Dumbledore's Army"" was meeting was incorrect and it didn't show the spell used to punish the traitor. Also the scene where Fred and George Weasley reeks havoc during the O.W.L. exams was watered down. Bellatrix Lestrange played by Helena Bonham Carter was scary and desirable at the same time.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Arguably The Weakest Harry Potter Film.,"After the truly magical Prisoner of Azkaban & darkly fascinating Goblet of Fire, Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix arrives as the fifth instalment in the 8-film series based on the novels by J.K. Rowling. And while its source material was the longest in the series, the movie is surprisingly short. And not just that, the film in itself is a major step down as the narration & presentation never really clicked this time.Order of the Phoenix covers Harry Potter's 5th year at Hogwarts where he finds himself rebuffed by most as they refuse to believe his or Dumbledore's account that Lord Voldemort has returned. With the Ministry plotting to keep things under the table & assigning one of their own into Hogwarts' staff, Harry experiences one of his toughest years at the school while The Dark Lord desperately covets a secret weapon he didn't have the last time.For a while in the Harry Potter franchise, the director's chair seemed just as jinxed as the Defence Against the Dark Arts post for we have David Yates taking over that role from Mike Newell. And Yates direction turns out to be really out of place as the film neither has the darkness nor the excitement of its predecessors. The screenplay leaves out exceptional amount of detail from the story & what's adapted isn't transitioned properly on the silver screen.The technical aspects are a step down as well in comparison to the previous two chapters, at least. It looks remarkably average in every department, except the performances which I will talk about next. And even the score by Nicholas Hooper doesn't manage to evoke any sort of feeling. Still there are few moments that's well captured & captivating but for the majority of its runtime, Order of the Phoenix remains very stale & adds nothing special to the franchise.As for the performances, the recurring cast has put their strong foot forward while the new additions are simply amazing. From the recurring cast, Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort), Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore), Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) & Gary Oldman (Sirius Black) are the standouts. Amongst the new cast, Evanna Lynch is bloody perfect as Luna Lovegood & so is Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. And Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge manages to make viewers hate her quite effortlessly.On an overall scale, Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix has moments of highs & lows and manages to entertain in bits n pieces but it still feels highly inferior when compared to how much the last two sequels contributed to the saga. It was headed for a disaster but manages to correct itself by some extent during its third act. What I love most about it is obviously Luna & Bellatrix and if only the story was as intriguing as these two characters, then Order of the Phoenix today would've been hailed as the series' finest. Unfortunately, it's arguably the weakest.",,Anonymous,Action
Best of the five movies,"I'm a huge Harry potter fan, books as well as movies and I can say I am not at all disappointed with this film. The movie was brilliantly made, and the dark feel was evident right from the beginning of the movie. What I was really happy about this one is it was more faithful to the book. The new actors like Imelda Staunton(played the role of Umbridge brilliantly), the young lady with potential Evanna Lynch who played Luna Lovegood and no need to mention the Bellatrix to the heights of evil.I particularly enjoyed the climax sequences which were a pleasure to watch in 3D, the movie went smoothly right from the beginning and there were no split ends. The lack of quidditch in the movie makes sense because the viewer can assume Umbridge might have banned that as well. I can say that this movie was the most touching of all the five because of the importance it emphasized on friendship and love. The movie also showed properly about the rebellion in school and fudge's lack of belief in Voldemort returning.Daniel Radcliffe has definitely improved in this movie and the improvement has been clearly seen in the final scenes where he had to fight Voldemort possessing him and Sirius dying. Emma and Rupert were great as Harry's friends Hermione and Ron as usual. The only mistake which I've seen is Luna using the spell ""Levicorpus"" in the final fight which does not come until the next book. Apart from that I'd give this movie a double thumbs up and everyone whether a book reader or not can watch it and still be able to appreciate it.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Excellent,"As a huge fan of the Harry Potter books I always look forward to the movies. I've never been let down with any movie as I was still really young (eleven) when the first one came out so I didn't know any better. However looking back on all of them now I definitely recognize their faults and strengths. I was very excited to see The Order of the Phoenix but a little skeptical since this had been my least favorite book. I was blown away. If I could have kept any director it definitely would have been Alfonso Cuaron, whose style and touches were perfectly suited for the third movie and a welcome change from Chris Columbus's kid-glove style. Mike Newell did a decent job with the fourth movie, though it suffered from plot changes that didn't work well. I did (and still do think) that he had the toughest challenge thus far with staging Voldemort's return and he did do a good job with that. David Yates did an amazing job. I really loved that he kept the movie dark and unsettling, with a few smatters of well-done dry humor here and there. The book is dense and not a pleasant trip and he conveyed that sense beautifully. He also managed to achieve something that none of the other directors, not even Cuaron, could do: he made the movie flow. None of the first four movies flow well at all; they all feel awkward and jerky and you can almost always see when they remove something from the book and try and smooth the transition. By showing the issues of the Daily Prophet as transitions he keeps you informed on what is going on outside the walls of Hogwarts as well as inside. It was a brilliant touch that I loved.Of course not all of the credit lies with Yates; the acting in this movie was superb. All three of the leads were at their best, although I did sense that the size of Rupert's role took a cut due to the immense popularity of Dan and Emma. Evanna Lynch was a better Luna Lovegood than I could have ever imagined. Helena Bonham Carter creates in Bellatrix Lestrange a villain that you can truly and purely hate. I always have trouble, even with the nastiest of villains, not feeling some sympathy for them or trying to understand them. I had no trouble hating the truly evil character that Bonham Carter paints. Imelda Staunton makes a perfect Dolores Umbridge. If I were asked at almost any time I would say that I much prefer Richard Harris's Dumbledore to Michael Gambon's, yet I felt that Gambon's portrayal was perfect for this movie.The only gripe I have is that they do cut a lot out. It is the shortest movie whereas the book is the longest in the series. The movie isn't really hindered by this, but purists will be incensed. I feel that the only scene that really suffered from the cuts and changes was the customary Dumbledore explanation at the end. That scene in the book is fraught with important points and raw emotion that is not conveyed properly in the movie.All in all I definitely felt that this was the best movie of the series and it is my favorite. Go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"Still a great deal of fun, but less captivating than previous installments","With each new film, the Harry Potter franchise gets darker and more mature, perhaps also to reflect the fact that the audience has grown up along with the characters. ""Darker"", however, is not synonymous with ""better"", in fact Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the least accomplished entry in the series so far.And yet it starts very promisingly: following a quarrel with his cousin Dudley, now a cruel bully, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is attacked by Dementors and thus forced to use magic in front of Muggles (i.e. human beings). Now, had this happened in one of the preceding movies, he would have gotten away with a mere warning, if even that. Unfortunately, that is not the case, as the Ministry of Magic has become incredibly paranoid when it comes to Harry: not only are they threatening to have him expelled from Hogwarts, they have also openly stated that the return of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), which the teen wizard witnessed at the end of Goblet of Fire, is a scandalous lie invented with the purpose of spreading panic and allowing Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) to take over the Ministry. Given the situation, all that is left to do is prepare for the imminent, inevitable battle in secret, which is why Dumbledore has restored the Order of the Phoenix, whose most prominent members include Harry's godfather, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman). Sadly, they can't do much to solve Harry's other problem: Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton), a Ministry employee who has managed to be appointed as the new teacher of Defense against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. Her intentions? To keep all students disciplined, make sure no one mentions the Dark Lord and, generally, turn all the good people's lives into Hell.Regarding the tone, which is closer to (moderate) horror than fantasy (hence the PG-13 rating that has been applied since the fourth film), some critics have expressed their disappointment, fearing the last two movies, yet to be filmed, might become too violent for the franchise's target audience. And while it is true that an R-rated seventh episode would lose many of its viewers, it is equally true that the bleak moments are the best in the whole film: the last half-hour is arguably the strongest conclusion a Potter film's had to date, emotionally speaking, whereas everything that comes before that, especially the lighter stuff, is quite uneven.The problem has almost nothing to do with the adaptation, in fact director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have managed to make an accessible, entertaining blockbuster out of an 800-page book which, according to many, is the weakest in the saga. Nearly all the unnecessary stuff that could have been amusing but wasn't very relevant in terms of plotting (such as possible returns for Kenneth Branagh and Miranda Richardson's characters) has been left out, ensuring the film hardly ever gets slowed down by futile digressions. There are, nonetheless, a few instances that are included in the movie but could easily have been left on the cutting room floor. What, for example, is the point of having Sirius' house elf Kreecher appear, when his contribution to the film's events equals zero (although he had an important role in the novel)? The same goes for Remus Lupin: it is nice to have David Thewlis back on board, but with very little of relevance to do or say the overall feeling is that his presence is merely a reminder of how great the third flick was (Brendan Gleeson, on the other hand, is allowed more space to reprise his quirky role from the previous installment). And last, but not least, the much talked-about kiss between Harry and Cho Chang (Katie Leung), which is part of the ""teen romance"" section introduced in the fourth picture, is actually a huge disappointment because: a) there is no more mention of the love story in the rest of the picture; b) the scene itself, being completely flat and lifeless (and what we see is supposedly the best of the several takes that were required), stands out as the single dullest moment in the franchise's history, making it even more ironic that the subsequent sequence, a conversation between Harry and Ron that follows the book word for word (""How was it?"" ""Wet!""), is one of the series' comic highlights.Elsewhere, though, the film seems to work pretty well, mainly thanks to the consistently reliable cast: Radcliffe is at his best, angry and in pain, while Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman, sidelined in the fourth film, are enabled to steal the show once again, the former warm and humane, the latter deliciously sinister. As for the bad guys, Fiennes' role is, as usual, brief but instantly memorable, and the same ought to be said of Jason Isaacs, finally allowed to fully show his dark side. Now, what about Staunton? Well, she is far from bad as an actress, but her characterization makes Umbridge more of an annoying buffoon rather than an unsettling threat, making it possible for fellow ""bad girl"" Helena Bonham Carter, who is truly disturbing and scary as the demented Bellatrix Lestrange, to outshine her.In the end, Order of the Phoenix is pretty good on its own, but sub-par compared to previous achievements. Hopefully Yates, who will direct the sixth film as well, will deliver a more even product next time.6,5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Action
They finally got one right,"This is my first review on IMDb.com I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, but to be honest I was very disappointed with the first four films. Although they have been true to the story most of the times, they never really caught the atmosphere of the books. The Order of the Phoenix changes that. It is by far the best film in the series and director David Yates and screenwriter Michael Goldenberg have done a great job turning the 800 pages of the book into an entertaining movie.It has been said that the storyline from the book has changed, and that is true. Goldenberg had to, otherwise we would have a movie of at least 6 hours. But the way he shortened the story is brilliant: he manages to shorten the story without leaving holes in the storyline, and every change he made still leaves the storyline intact and even true to the book. That is a huge improvement over Goblet of Fire, which left left people who did not know the book with loads of riddles.Another thing that has wildly improved over the previous book is the performance of the actors, which now actually shows what the cast is capable of with a competent director (well, I still do not like Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, but even he improved).But the hugest improvement over the last movie is actually that David Yates got the pace of the movie just right. While the movie stays relatively true to the book, it manages to be an entertaining movie on its own, which for me was the biggest surprise in the cinema since it is based on the Harry Potter book with the most complicated storyline to date. Overall this movie might actually please book-readers and book-ignorers alike.9 out of 10!",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Horribly Magical,The previous four Harry Potter movies have been designed for people who are too lazy to read the most amazing book series to land on this planet in years. This movie left fans dazed and confused as they searched for understanding in this year's adventure for Harry and his friends. This movie did JK Rowling's work absolutely no justice. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am a faithful Harry Potter fan. I have been in line at midnight on several occasions and am not afraid to admit it. This movie has ruined Harry Potter for many people in my life who left the theater utterly confused. It also didn't make me happy that I had to sit and explain certain things from the movie for over an hour. I understand that this is a long book to be condensed into a movie. I give the directors credit for condensing. They could have had another hour of my time without a care. This was the most wasted two hours I have ever spent in my entire life. I recommend that no one sees this movie ever but that instead you read this book and the rest of the series so that you can truly understand the magic that is Harry Potter.,1.0,Anonymous,Action
v. good but could be better,"i have just watched this film and i thought it was good. but it could have been so much better, it was too short and some of the best bits were unessecarily cut-out.i understand that much of the book needs to be cut out, but they didn't need to cut as much as they did because the movie was only 2 hours and 17 mins!!!if you have not read the book(S) i think you will love the filmthings missed out:ron and hermione as prefects, all quidditch, department of mysteries different rooms, st. mungos, peeves,i think sirius' death should have been longer as it is one of the main bits of the book and was short lived, i also think more should have been made of loads of scenes such as the sirius flashback.i think too long was spent on the da meetings. and loads of the film was rushed and quickoverall a very good watch especially if you hav'nt read the book(S)",10.0,Anonymous,Action
A Great Improvement!!,"An excellent movie! I think it was definitely a step up from the 3rd one and the fourth one. It contained some scary moment and some hilarious ones too! I don't know if it is just me, but I find that the Danie, Emma, and Rupert have grown immensely I can only hope that the rest of theses movies will be of this caliber! I seriously recommend this movie. However, I'm not sure you will enjoy as much if you haven't read the books. None-the-less,you will enjoy it either way. They did a great job adapting the book, which must've been quite a challenge since the book is 870 pages. It's also a good memory refresher.

I don't think so,"I don't think this film is as good as other HP movies. There is a huge gap from the book to the movie. The best part of the book as i think is the climax and Fred and Georges work what is shortened in the movie. this two scenes could have done better.Some parts were unnecessary but were in the movie. And the director did not give much importance on DA. But the acting of Harry potter, Ron and Dolores Umbridge is very good. I like there acting. But this film is not as good as other HP series. Screenplay would have been better.As a harry potter fan i expect more from the forthcoming Harry potter movies and i hope they will not disappoint us.",,Anonymous,Action
Not a film for younger children,"I must admit that I've never read any of the Potter books, so i've therefore got no great allegiance to the franchise. I expected the movies to be aimed at a very much younger audience, but to my mind these films (after the first two instalments) aren't really suitable for younger children. I have found the darker tones of the films quite interesting and have been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the movies.The order of the Phoenix sees Harry Potter fairly isolated at times and the performance of Daniel Radcliffe is quite commendable. With an excellent supporting cast this is probably going to be one of the best acted blockbusters of the summer. I've always found Gary Oldman one of the finest actors and he doesn't disappoint here. One quibble would be some of the effects aren't up to scratch, but isn't it nice to be complaining about the effects rather than the acting!!",6.0,Anonymous,Action
best so far,"this is definitely the best potter film so far. the first film was childish, however i did enjoy it because it came out when i was 12, but i feel the films have grown up with me, now i'm 18 and OOTP has just the right ingredients to appeal to my kind of audience - girlfriends, emotional turmoil, anger etc.Imelda Staunton was great as Umbridge,she was so annoying yet so well acted, she made me feel virtually sick,as did her character in the book. Luna was also brilliantly portrayed by Evanna Lynch, considering it's her first film in the franchise and indeed at all(I think), she did a smashing job and a lot better than even some of the main child actors.Overall, David Yates has given a whole new style to the film, unlike directors before. The newspaper technique used in order to show the passing of time and some of the other montages were excellent as it allowed minute details from the book to be included so that fans would not be angry but also adding rich detail to the film itself.I hope Yates directs the next film, or maybe Alfonso Cuaron. The other directors didn't do a brilliant job of their films.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Not the happiest of films...,"The series really starts getting dark now... Harry is ""touchy"", loosing his temper and not knowing why (hey, he's a teen!). Dolores Umbridge is highly disturbing, which means Imelda Staunton did a good job with the character. But the feeling of the film is depressing...If you like bad guys, there are lots of them in this one. Even Robert Hardy's Fudge character is a meany this time. I don't know why Hardy's scenes were always so short, you only got a whiff of him. A bit more Snape in this one. Mark William's hairpiece is awful this go-around, not sure what's up with that one!The loss of the fun and mystical sets adds to the depressing feel of the film. And we haven't even got to the REALLY depressing parts of the Potter timeline yet!",6.0,Anonymous,Action
An excellent Potter film,"I never have grown tired of this Potter film, in my opinion apart from the final two it is the best. It perfectly highlights the dangerous link between Voldemort and Harry, and takes viewers on a magical journey as Harry fights to find himself in this dark chapter. The final scenes are well acted and with Helena Bohnam Carter as Bellatrix it really makes the film thrilling and scary, giving a slight taste as to what fans should expect in the last Potter(s). Watching Harry Potter and Order of the Pheonix in cinema's made me realize as to exactly why i love all the Potter movies, it gave me goosebumps and the music was quite supportive of the theme too and i would recommend to all others if they have not seen this Potter then they are indeed missing out.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Incomplete Story,"I loved the acting and directing in this film, and I thought that the effects were quite good, but the story was lacking, and the tone was too persistently dark.As far as the story, it just felt like a jumble of events without a solid story line. I have grown accustomed to the Harry Potter films having much of the story cut out, it is to be expected if you want a movie to come in at under 4 hours, but this was extreme. The title of the movie is Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, but the Order does not play more than a VERY minor, passing role that may as well have been completely omitted from the movie all together. There are several things that make this movie hard to follow as a story in itself, rather than just a bridge between movies.As far as the mood of the movie, I understand that this was the darkest book to date, but the movie cut out all of the joy and levity present in the book. The entire book was not just a dark brood-fest, and that made the book palatable. The drudgery just got old after a while.It is often said that the movies are supposed to be taken on their own merits, ignoring the quality of the books or the previous movies. Doing that with this movie only makes the movie worse, because out of the context of the books and other movies this film was complete gibberish. As a part of a series the movie was entertaining, but it really needed to add about 45 more minutes of story in order to stand on its own.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"Under Yates, ""Potter"" No. 5 beautifully embraces the dark side of the novels","Despite its fourth director in five tries and even a new screenwriter, the Harry Potter franchise takes a huge step forward in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" based off the fifth book in the young adult fantasy series by J.K Rowling. Whereas Harry's character growth took a backseat in the Mike Newell-directed fourth film, ""Goblet of Fire,"" ""Order of the Phoneix"" restores our protagonist to a place of inner turmoil where he is set to achieve great personal growth.British TV director David Yates takes on the task of directing Michael Goldenberg's (2003 remake of ""Peter Pan"") script and the results are deeper and darker than Harry Potter has ever gone before on the silver screen. Gladly, Yates' favorite Potter film prior was the third, ""Prisoner of Azkaban,"" directed by Alfonso Cuaron, who took a much more character-driven take on the series, which resonated more with most fans and critics. Yates successfully restores the series' intelligence and wit, remaining magical and mysterious but also full of tension and excitement. The pacing is quick like ""Goblet of Fire,"" but our portrait of Harry is in greater detail.In ""Order of the Phoenix,"" Harry (Radcliffe) takes a step closer to his destiny as he learns more and more about Voldemort (Fiennes), the man who killed his parents and has tried to kill Harry in the past. Although Voldemort has returned, the Ministry of Magic, the governing body over wizards and witches, have been denying it to the public and spinning it to make Harry and his headmaster at Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore (Gambon) look like conspirators. That brings Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) to Hogwarts, a power-hungry old woman who takes the school under her control and fills it with propaganda. Harry and his friends must now take things into their own hands to prepare for Voldemort's inevitable rise to power.As Voldemort's return to power looms fast-approaching in the distance, a dark overtone sweeps through all of this film and Yates is sure to use proper foreshadow to keep it so. His ace is Staunton, the series' most vivid antagonist to date. She's deranged in the pink and frilly sort of way and takes over Hogwarts with a laugh and a smile. In response, Harry forms an underground club where he teaches magic self-defense to fellow friends and students such as the usual Ron and Hermione (Grint and Watson), more extensive parts from Neville (Matthew Lewis), Ginny (Bonnie Wright) and Harry's crush Cho (Katie Leung) and new character Evanna Lynch as the odd and spacey Luna Lovegood.But the film belongs to Radcliffe. This is his most trying performance as Harry yet and he meets great success. Harry is having constant nightmares in the story in addition to the one unfolding before him. Radcliffe really has to juggle anger, fear and his new role of leader. Thanks to some great writing and direction too, we understand exactly what Harry's going through at every turning point.Most thrilling, however, is we get to see wizard fighting wizard action for the first time. It's beautiful, scary and really intense. Choreographer Paul Harris helps turn this wand-fighting into an art form and the visual effects crew does the rest with sparks flying and characters zooming about in puffs of smoke. Action can finally be added to the list of genres that Harry Potter applies to and without embellishment.Just as Harry Potter begins to embrace his destiny in this film, ""Order of the Phoenix"" accepts the darkness that these books naturally have evolved toward and it does so with not only great visuals that bring the novel to life, but with Harry's inner struggle. Yates understands this and as long as he's there, we can count on the remaining two adaptations to do great justice to this story.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

"What can a mediocre director do for Harry Potter? Obviously, nothing","I too have not read any of the books, so I will be judging the movie only on its merits as a film. It felt like a strangely anti-climactic film, in contrast to the story itself that was filled with excitement (one can tell that, even without prior knowledge of the book). The expectations were kept high all along but great disappointment ensued after the most important final scene - like something was missing, or failed to materialize. It was muddled, and somehow the dramatic importance of the events did not sink in at all. On top of that, there were countless secondary incidents and characters introduced here for the first time, while others (older characters) hardly got the attention they deserved - inevitable with such a production where stellar actors like Emma Thompson only get a scene or two at best and mostly serve as decoration. The fault lies entirely with the director. I came away feeling that the movie had no economy, no clear progression, no climax, and no distinct personality (as a film). Far too much time was spent on incidents that could have been compressed for the sake of the film's economy, which also created the impression that the director was trying not to disappoint the readers attempting a far too literal adaptation of the book (at least that's how it felt). I also heard others comment that the final scene was badly edited - to the point that some of the things that happened seemed incomprehensible (in how they came about). By far, the best Harry Potter film was no. 3 and I have no idea why they would let such a brilliant director as Alfonso Cuaron, walk away from the series. What is worst, I saw on IMDb that David Yates is to direct the next Harry Potter film! How that is to be prevented, I have no idea - but certainly it will be unfair for viewers and readers alike to be left with mediocre movies towards the end of the series. The only bright point in the film was the performances: Especially the delicious Imelda Staunton, the wonderful Gary Oldman, and the infallible Alan Rickman. Of course, people will see the movie no matter what anyone says or writes about it (I would), but is it too late to change the director of the next installment?",,Anonymous,Action
Harry Potter... You will lose... everything.,"I actually got the opportunity to see this today and was mesmerized by the increasing maturity of the movies in the series. It actually was more of an adult film that the previous ones and makes me think that we are in for a treat with the next two.The usual gang is back, and there are some great performances. I particularly liked Richard Griffiths (Vernon Dursley) in his brief appearance; Natalia Tena (Mrs. Henderson Present, About a Boy) was the first really attractive adult in the films; Gary Oldman (Sirius Black) was also excellent; Alan Rickman (Snape) is a favorite; and, of course, Ralph Fiennes as Lord Valdamort.I really liked the performance of Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. I am looking forward to seeing her again. And the addition of unknown Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood was brilliant casting.The ending fights were spectacular and worth the price of admission. This was definitely the best yet and makes me anxious for number six.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

Poor editing takes a good book and crams in too many pieces...,"It must be unbearable to watch this movie without having read the book.

If you read the book you know what it is, but you also know that half of those parts were left out only to confuse the viewer. It certainly looked like they had a movie that went on too long and did some bad cuts to get it in on time, only to make things too confusing. This is the 5th movie of 7 and the worst so far. I gave it a 7 because it is entertaining, but jumps around too much. It was like they had to hit a bunch of key points of the book with no flow. I also felt like they had to get stuff in for reference in the next two movies. What can you do. Too much book for the big screen and to many directors and editors crossing multiple movies. Too bad they didn't go the PeterJackson/LOTR route and let one crew do the whole thing. One vision, one story and consistency.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

The worst in the series.,"I am a massive fan of the Potter series and my expectations for this film were very high. Yates has recreated many sequences from the book yet has neglected to provide us any of the genuinely emotional moments that define the series. The book (as i see it) is about family (Harry and Sirius, the Blacks, The Weasleys, The Longbottoms) and the terrifying prospect of something horrific happening to our loved ones. The danger is more real than ever, loved ones are getting hurt. This is defined in the book by the scene that really had to be in the film yet tragically wasn't... Mrs Weasley and the Boggart. We should care about the characters like they care for each other. Its difficult to care for a bunch of cameos, with screen time so short and characterisation near non existent, it feels like watching a sequence of events that you really don't care about. Harry's relationship with Sirius is underdeveloped and Sirius's murder wasn't the hero's death he deserved. This film is the worst in the series.",8.0,Anonymous,Action

"Powerfully done, beautiful and frightening at the same time.","There will be thousands of comments on this movie so I will keep mine brief: Brilliantly done movie from start to finish. Series actors have moved from portraying the characters to being the characters. Stunningly beautiful photography. The soundtrack wonderfully complements and accents the mood and tone of the movie. The new characters are wonderful: Delores Umbridge the acerbic Ministry of Magic appointee; Luna Lovegood adds a quirky charm and purity to her scenes and the Weasley brothers keep things wonderfully interesting throughout, and there are many more who deserve mention as well. The villains are more villainous and the heroes are more heroic. It is an amazing, well-told story that leaves you, at least if you are any sort of fan, hungering for much, much more.The local megaplex where I went for the opening night showing sold out 8 theaters, out of 21 possible screens.

Reviews both brief and late,"I know it's a bit late after the release but I've just got round to watching Harry Potter: Order of the Phoenix and I must say I was impressed. For those of you getting frustrated by the childish nature of the previous movies and their failure to remain true to the books will be pleased that this one is stepping ever closer to being true to the book and also being made for adults.Although many characters have been sidelined such as Kreacher (House Elf in the Black household), other characters were cut completely including Firenze (the Centaur who takes over the divination post) and Nearly Headless Nick, the screenwriters have managed to compensate by simply cutting out bits of the book such as the content of several lessons, the naming of Dumbledore's Army and the entire Quidditch story line.Seeing as this review has been submitted so late I expect you may have either seen this film or heard about it from someone else, so I shall leave you to go back to your copies of Deathly Hallows as I am sure you have purchased said book in this time of Harry Mania. For those interested at all I am giving Harry Potter: Order of the Phoenix 7 Horcruxes out of 10 (hardcore fans will notice that 7 is the number of Horcruxes Voldemort has, even more hardcore fans will notice that the term Horcrux doesn't appear in Order of the Phoenix).",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"If you have never seen a movie, don't make an exception for this one!","When I walked out of the theater, somebody behind me said, and I quote: ""All in all, another good film."" Personally I think this film is an approach to what Rowling means with the agony of the cruciatus curse: You'd rather die than going through this much pain any longer! I felt violated and never wanted to inflict physical pain on someone (preferably the director of this pile of nose-pulk) more than after seeing this film. It would probably have been better if Daniel Radcliffe at least tried to remember anything from his acting classes (though I seriously doubt he has ever taken them), and would at least show SOME interest in the art of acting. Furthermore, this movie makes me wish for an early death of Harry Potter in the books. If he can die right at the beginning of number 7, that would be swell! We can watch Daniel Radcliffe die in the film, and maybe (and that is a huge maybe) enjoy the remainder of the film. The character development has been incredibly bad from the first movie on. But in this part, they have hit an ultimate low. I went to the theater without any expectations. It is something like a miracle to experience that the people responsible for this pile of garbage have been able to crush even the complete absence of expectations. They can crush emptiness as it were. Along with Alan Rickman, this last thing is worth applauding. Alan, you're great! Your performance in comparison with the other actors in this film makes you a God!

Needs a better director.,"This is a movie that only people that have read the book will understand - and, unfortunately, it is obviously these people that will be let down. The plot moves along at an exceedingly fast, cut-and-snip pace that leaves simple cinematic nuances on the cutting room floor, going at a pace that would be more suitable to a bomb-filled action movie than a magical one.This movie could have benefited by a little bit more time, and a different director. The beginning, which though not necessarily important to plot is actually quite important to the cinematic experience was completely left on the cutting room floor. I couldn't even figure out who was talking - Harry or Dudley; it went too fast to tell. Even the beginning credit sequence was cut short - silenced in mid-overture. The ending seems like an after thought - many plot pieces that should have been much more coddled were left to simple half minute scenes. The high point in this film is not the end, but the middle - when Umbridge is making all her ridiculous rules. It's kind of sad - that isn't really the most important part of the plot but it is given movie-star treatment, and is done well. Nearly the entire middle of the movie is quite enjoyable - though, obviously, cut short from the book. Had the rest of the movie been like this, I would have given it a much higher rating.This director could do to learn something from the Lord of the Rings director - how to compact a very long, drawn-out book into a well-paced movie that EVERYONE can understand and enjoy.",,Anonymous,Action
"Worth watching, although not amazing","This movie seemed a lot more artistic than the other movies. It's more abstract, more visual. Now don't get me wrong, I love artistic films, but with Harry Potter? You just don't do that. The film was choppy (not in a bad way, but shouldn't have been done with HP), with momentary glimpses into the plot and a few specific details pointed out.I think a good way to describe this movie would be as though you're viewing someone's memories with the pensieve (those who have read the books should know what I mean). It's all about what Harry sees and feels and thinks.I did love the ministry of magic battle. The visual effects were stunning and looked like what magic would look like if it were real. I did not love, however, how they totally changed it. And somehow, Voldemort seemed less scary, less intense, less evil.So, to sum up my short review: It was neat to see Yate's perspective and interpretation, but sometimes, you just gotta stick to the book. This is another ""it's a movie, not a book"" type of thing. If you liked the third movie, you'll love this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"Action, Drama, Magic","I have to say, I have not been disappointed by the Harry Potter Film Series yet. This film had tremendous acting portraying drama and action at times. The story itself felt a little dull, but the characters for sure make up for it. Another good film.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"Not the best Harry Potter film, unfortunately","As a huge Harry Potter fan I diligently went to the midnight release of the film and after which I felt compelled to voice my opinion on it:The acting was amazing as always, including the new members of the cast (Luna and Tonks you rock! Bellatrix and Umbridge were both deliciously evil and crazy), the story: written by a Goddess, the costumes: wonderful, the special effects: magical (literally), the sets were great (although I didn't think it was necessary to change the location and appearance of some already established places but whatever I'll go with it). However, the big problem with this film and the only reason it is only getting 9 stars instead of 10 is because of the plot itself. I firmly believe that a book and a movie are two totally different media and that even ones about the same material should not be compared and my complaint has nothing to do with that part of it. I don't know whose fault it was, the new screenwriter's or the new director's or the editor's (I don't know if he is new) or someone else's but the biggest problem with this film is that it was so choppy that a person like myself, one who usually finds it very easy to empathize with the characters on screen and who knows the story well, found it hard to keep up and fully enjoy the experience. I believe that if you have not read this book you will not enjoy the film and will have difficult time following the events that are thrown at you in this 2 hour plus film. This story was the biggest book, so it would have been forgivable if this was also the longest film (3 hrs even) but the people in charge tried to cram this loaded story into roughly 2 hours and in the process lost the real conviction that the audience normally feels when watching Harry's struggles. This is a true shame for this, of all the films, should be the one were people sympathize and worry about Harry but the lack of flow directs all of the viewers attentions to keeping up with the story and doesn't allow you any time to chew over the situation Harry and friends are headed for. And then before you know it, you take a breath and the film is over. Being the loyal and avid Harry Potter fan that I am (and out of respect for the actors and the crew who made the film; who, let me repeat, were awesome!) I will probably go see the film again and buy it when it comes out. I will simply have to grit my teeth and try to enjoy such a short and jerky ride.P.S. I do sincerely hope that the director is not responsible for this chaotic tangle as he will be at the helm for the following film!",9.0,Anonymous,Action
order of the phoenix,"Order of the phoenix isnt one of the best harry potter films but it is a solid one,mostly what takes me out of a film was to much dream sequances and switch of harry character to even make him little unlikable even if a story requires that,the final battle was very good made and it showed as what we can expect in future films and it did solid way in build up the next instalasment also even if death of sirius black was sad i wish that film focused more on harry and his relationship and then it would make a bigger impact for us",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"The Order of the Phoenix, is a solid addition","The fifth installment of the Harry Potter series, The Order of the Phoenix, brings back some of the magic that Goblet of Fire lacked, though it still doesn't quite match the enchantment of Prisoner of Azkaban. I appreciated the introduction of new characters, especially the members of the Order. The scene at Sirius's house, where Harry talks to him in the room with the family tree, was a standout moment. However, Sirius's death was a real gut-punch, emotional and felt all too real. On a positive note, I noticed some improvements in editing over the previous film. I was hoping for more intense moments, like when Dumbledore used the Slowing Charm (Arresto Momentum) on Harry during Prisoner of Azkaban, but didn't find any that matched that intensity.As with previous adaptations, some details from the book didn't make it into the movie. For instance, the film omits the Quidditch storyline, including Ron becoming the Keeper for the Gryffindor team and the tensions that arise from it. The character of Mundungus Fletcher, a member of the Order with a penchant for shady dealings, is also absent. These omissions streamline the plot but take away some of the depth from the story.Overall, I enjoyed The Order of the Phoenix as much as the other films, but it didn't quite capture the magic of Prisoner of Azkaban for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

I probably ruined it for myself by reading the book only a couple weeks ago, but still. I did enjoy the movie the effects were awesome and the storyline was great. But I guess my problem is because it was the longest book in the series and it was made into the shortest movie of the series that they sort of lost some of the pieces that would have made is an even better film. However, I don't speak for anyone but myself therefore I recommend you go and see the movie for yourself and tell us what you think of it.The reason I gave it a seven was because I thoroughly enjoy movies, but for some reason that just didn't meet my standards for an excellent movie.

Think Lucinda Williams & it's the fifth out of seven...what do you think it means?!,"Ahhh... got to be the only schmuck with a subject line like that for a 'Harry Potter' movie - but think of the intent behind ""Joy"" and you've captured much of the feeling of the audience's reaction walking out of the latest 'Harry Potter.' Though it's madly efficient and quite often exciting, squeezing in 850 pages of text into the shortest Potter yet, less than 140 minutes, this fifth installment is decidedly more dour and grim than the previous installments. A recurring theme of the past films has been the teamwork that has made Harry, Hermoine and Ron such a formidable trio. The later two take a backseat in this story so that the depiction of Harry's melancholic internal struggle can be front and center. Thankfully, the prevalence of the book's most devious and clever creation, the fascist middle-manager Delores Umbridge, has remained intact. Imelda Staunton, her family name quite appropriate for such a niggling squat character. Gosh, how I adored the emittance of her high-pitched squeal - intended to be friendly...instead such an assault. Also, like always, the film makes grand usage of its exemplary all-star British cast - everyone getting an opportunity to interact within the rich Hogwarts universe. Especially noteworthy are watching Branagh's old flames mug it up under heavy makeup. Never dull, the film flies by... but by the end of a special effects laden climactic battle we realize how unimportant this story in the grand scheme.

Very nice addition to the series.,"I had incredibly low expectations for this movie, and I actually didn't know I was going to see it opening night until my friends told me they had tickets like six hours before the show. Needless to say, I was quite impressed.The film covers most of the events that occurred in the 5th Harry Potter book subtitled ""The Order of the Phoenix."" It did an EXCELLENT job at portraying almost all of the necessary elements to the story, while twisting some events away from the actual story line. Personally, I enjoyed that. I don't like to see movies that are 100% what they're based on- there's no element of surprise, and a lot of the fun of watching a movie is taken away. I won't say what parts were/were not excluded for the sake of not spoiling anything for those that haven't read the book (shame!) or what was changed so that you can be pleasantly surprised like I was. The plot did tend to stick to what was absolutely necessary to keep the story progressing, though. The lack of ""filler"" disappointed me. We didn't get to see any of Harry's classes besides Defense against the Dark Arts, or classes where Professor Umbridge was ridiculing other teachers and threatening their job security. Draco Malfoy also appeared for... all of three minutes.I was never really too fond of the children cast of Harry Potter's movie series. They aged too quickly for the movie series, and often acted really... poorly. Example: Harry's character stutters after saying ""He's trying to..."", and before he can pause long enough to indicate that he's dropped the sentence or thought, Hermione jumps in and says ""to what Harry?"" Little details like that prevent me from taking them serious as actors. I guess I've never had a qualm with Rupert Grint (Ron) and don't mind Harry as much as I do Hermione.That said, there were a lot of really corny and cheesy moments- Moments where the entire cast laughs at something completely not funny or assaults the audience with preachy and ridiculous lines that are just... stupid and show signs of poor writing. Surely the director could have hired a writer more skilled to portray these characters for such a high profile film! The film also introduced 2 new characters- Professor Umbridge and Luna Lovegood. Both were portrayed AMAZINGLY. Umbridge was a perfect representation of what the character would be, and really made the plot interesting. The same goes for Luna, whose ""dreamy"" voice quality was perfectly recreated.I really enjoyed myself. For some reason, I suffer some sort of ""amnesia"" in between releases of new Harry Potter books and movies and forget how much I love them. This movie has once again reinvigorated my interest in the series, and it just might be one of my favorites.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

The acting itself has improved beyond measures, especially Dan, it shows a lot in his expressions and his out-bursts, they also act older and finally can show that the movie is no longer in the shadow of the kids section (no offence to the young ones here), thanks to David Yates whose efforts are worldwide appreciated by the HP fans as he is the first to make it seem more like an adult movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Stop comparing the book to the film. really.,"I haven't read one word from any HP book. And because of that I probably have no right to write a critique of the critics. But I have seen all the movies and OotP is easily the best FILM of the HP series and generally a good movie. Keep that non-profane four-letter f-word in mind. FILM.YOU CANNOT COMPARE A BOOK TO A FILM. Stop passing judgment based on what the film omitted/changed from the book. I understand that many of you are hardcore book-readers who want to see as much of the book as possible in the cinematic representation. However, movies are an entirely different entertainment medium from books.Remember that filmmakers have to consider infinitely more aspects of presenting a story than an author.What does an author need to write a good book? A good story, a laptop maybe, and a publisher. Any constraints? None on length, sometimes on composition time, marketability is a concern, little money is needed for production (no budget), and generally authors get paid AFTER the book is done (unless the publisher expects a best-seller, which is uncommon).What does a filmmaker(director) need to make a good movie? A good story, millions of dollars from a studio which will limit your creative freedom, good actors (who are hard to find and/or cost a fortune), an able cinematographer, a score composer/good soundtrack, the space to shoot the movie, a cgi team (very expensive, especially for fantasy films), and countless other pieces in a film puzzle. Any constraints? money, money, money, production schedules, actor schedules, the right time of day for certain scenes, marketability is many times more important for a film compared to a book, the fact that there's a budget necessitates much omission, 1 1/2 to 3 hours in length, and money.I think I have a good analogy for this issue: someone is asked to depict the ups and downs of an entire 16-game season of a football team as one 60-minute game. Wouldn't there be ample omission? the creator would have to make tough decisions about what's most important/interesting and leave out the rest. One game is nowhere near as detailed and varied as a season, but no one wants to watch 16 games in one sitting. Same goes for book-to-film adaptations.So to argue that films and books aren't at all comparable, I had to make a comparison. The director(forgot his name) had 3 hours max to adapt an 870-page book. And given the expected young, impatient audience, the studio must have implored him to keep the length down. Give him a break. The movie was great.I've also seen suggestions to split this movie into multiple parts. That makes no sense. HP is already going to be 7 different films! how would splitting any of them for the sake of the books work? Critics, please leave the book out of the HP movie comments. For real. Stop it.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
"Dark, professional, engaging and enjoyable","Another year begins for Harry with more challenges than ever. The Ministry seem intent on having him expelled and it is only some timely interventions that save him  but they come at a cost to those involved. Back at Hogwarts proper and changes are afoot with the addition to the teaching staff of Professor Delores Umbridge as the new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher. Umbridge's refusal to actually teach the class sees Harry and his friends secretly practicing themselves but cannot stop her rise to power, displacing Dumbledore. This all occurs while the shadow of Voldemort looms over Harry's life.I've still not bothered to read any of these bl00dy books and I'm rarely that bothered about seeing the newest films but I must confess that the Harry Potter films are often pretty good when I actually do get around to seeing them. It is a surprise then that I'm not more into them in the way that some other series have held my attention but there you go. Anyway, Order of the Phoenix eventually came to me on DVD and I settled down expecting professional big budget entertainment. And this is what it delivers and it is hard to fault it for what it does  again its failure to really grip me across films is not one I can pin on any one thing and certainly not in this film.For my money the series has got stronger as it has gone along and it does feel like it has become more comfortable in itself and its audience but, rather than complacency that this guaranteed box office might produce the films have worked harder. Phoenix is stronger than Goblet of Fire, which itself was better than the one before (the first two films didn't really do a lot for me even if they were ""good""). Opening with a tremendously stylish and gripping extended sequence, the film marks out its darker material from the start. It continues with this pretty well and the happiness and carefree introductions of the first few films are pretty much gone. I imagine that this will not be to the pleasing of parents of young fans but for me the menace and fear is pretty well balanced out, although I'm not a great judge as for me I like the idea that films meant for children would have dark themes and not just be a collection of soft shapes and bright colours where everything is right with the world in every regard.The story provides some strong set pieces and the series has improved yet again in the area of effects. The final fight sequence producing convincing and engaging effect shots as if it was doing it just for fun. Yates' direction is effective and he holds well to the look of the other films but yet brings stuff of his own. He doesn't let it sag often and the film does feel tighter than earlier ones even if at times the ""bigger picture"" was lost on me as we seemed to have very specific narrative threads going on. The characters are stronger and parts of the cast step up to this; Radcliffe in particular impressed me with his range and he genuinely (and literally) has grown with the role. The supporting cast is as usual deep in British stars but this was not as distracting to me as before. Fiennes is a great force in the background and his limit time is well used. Oldman, Rickman, Smith, Issacs, Thompson, Carter and others all provide quality even in small roles. Staunton is a nice addition and does well in what she has to do even if I felt the film gave too much time to her here and there. The young cast are good in some areas (eg Watson, Grint) but the non-speaking roles are annoyingly overdone with their facial expressions and they bugged me hanging around the edges of action (""ok kids, act INVOLVED!"").Overall though this is a very engaging and enjoyable film that seemed to effortlessly fill the time. Something about the series is still failing to hold me to the long game and I think it is the development of really strong characters but this is getting better as it gets darker. Regardless though the film is very professional with strong effects, starry cast and a consistently engaging plot. More importantly it is better yet again than the film before and is a credit to the series at a time when most film series tend to fade rather than grow.",,Anonymous,Action
Couldn't have been any better...,"One of the best films of the series. I myself am a big fan of the books as well, and I think they did an excellent job of telling the story even with the cuts that had to be made.

Everyone did a great job. Once again, awesome movie!!! My fiancé was with me when we watched the movie, and he loved it as well and he isn't even a fan of the books. There was a lot smoother connection between this movie and the one prior than in the past. I can't wait to see the next one.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
The order is barely in this movie,"When you think about it, one of the weirder Harry Potter movies. While there has always been political undertones in the Harry Potter universe, this is the one movie where it's really in the forefront. The ministry and its long arms are the main villains here, not really Voldemort, and I think that is a good thing after having a movie centered around him. Sure, he is still an important part and Harry's inner fights really important here, but I feel like this is nice pallet cleansers at the same time as the political aspects. I actually liked what I rewatched here. It's a pretty different but impactful Harry Potter movie, even though it can feel a bit aimless and boring at times.After the return of Voldemort, Harry is put on trail for using magic outside of school. The ministry don't believe the return of Voldemort and is afraid the Hogwarts students will lean magic to rebel, so they send Dolores Umbridge to set up new rules for Hogwarts.An element I really liked here, but I really wished was raised to its highest level, were the wizard battles. I really feel like we saw the best wizard battle in this movie, that isn't just colored beam vs colored beam. There is a lot of magic used in this movie, compared to some of the others, and the battles are actually exiting. I wished some of the spells had a bit more flare to them and the fights had some better camera choreography to really make it perfect, but that's wishful thinking now.While there is some good cinematography here and there, this movie feels and looks highly pretentious at times. Especially for a Harry Potter movie. It dulls down a bit, but especially in the beginning, there are so many shots that are just too artsy for a movie like this.Once again, the acting and characters are absolutely great. The kid actors that are now more or less adult really does a great job, and especially Daniel Radcliffe has evolved a lot. I must say, though, I feel like Hermione acting has gone down a bit. The face acting is just too much, and Ron is just acting more and more depressed constantly. New characters are also introduced here, like Luna Lovegood, an interesting and fun character to add to the rooster. My favorite added character though is Dolores Umbridge, she is such a terrible person that is really well acted here by Imelda Staunton. I don't really know how Umbridge is in the book, but I love how she is framed in the movie. Slowly descending into more and more of a power hungry person. How she can't look at Harry during her first punishment like she hates doing it but finds it necessary, to then fully looking at a room full of people being punished. It's a slow but strong descent of a great written villain you can only hate. I also really love Harry's character here. He has developed so much to stand up for others and himself in this movie, becoming an excellent teacher to others and having a great speech at the end.This movie's biggest flaw is focus and tempo. This movie is handling 2 plots. Harry and Voldemort fighting and learning about each other and the school being on lockdown. The 2 elements are 2 very separate storylines so they never really meet and that can make the movie's tempo go up and down constantly to an extent where I had a hard time following the movie. It can feel aimless at times in the worst way possible and having a hard time blending the whole story it wants to tell.While the fighting is good with magic and the sets are fun and creative. I must say, the CGI on creatures are hit-and-miss. It's primarily on people it looks bad and giants too, but overall it's a mixed bag when it comes to the effects. I really liked the set of the ministry of magic! It looks absolutely incredible, and it made me want to see more of it. Setting up a world you want to explore is a great thing in fantasy!As mentioned, this is half a good vs evil movie and also a political influence movie. It's interesting to see the students of Hogwarts fight the iron grip of the ministry. While it could have been fleshed out way more so that it seemed less black and white, the idea is good. It leads to a lot of montages, and they can feel a bit too much at times, with humor that really doesn't land inserted.Once again an amazing score is delivered, this time by Nicholas Hooper. In general, the scores of these movies are all pretty good.I think some of the conflict needed to be handled a bit better here. Dumbledore is avoiding Harry to protect him, he says, and I really don't understand how that was supposed to work. They needed to explain better what Snape prepared Harry for, instead of not really understanding what those scenes were about. These are complaints that I think the runtime could have used more time on, rather than doing montages and gags.This movie also continues a fun trend for the movie, where the taglines of the movie become more and more relevant. The Order of the Phoenix is barely in this movie.This movie is also pretty solid. Flawed and a bit awfully paced, but overall pretty entertaining! There are a lot of great ideas that are executed well, and you could easily see what worked well here. David Yates more or less overtook the Harry Potter cinematic universe from here on out and that will bring solid works likes these but also some of the worst from the franchise. I think he is a very experimental filmmaker, but that isn't always a good thing. Here it worked, though.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

This one's for fans of the books only,"I attended a screening last night with my Wife who is an avid fan and has read all the books several times. I must admit that I have not, but I have seen all the other films in the series and for the most part really enjoyed them all.However, I found The order of the Phoenix to be very slow moving at times and also a little boring. There was very little of the fast paced action that made The Goblet of Fire so enjoyable for me. Looking around the cinema, there were a lot of children in there who were getting restless and some were even falling asleep.OK, that's my take on it. However, my wife thought it was brilliant and really atmospheric and although a lot of the book had been cut out in order to stop the running time from being about 4 hours, she thought it was an accurate portrayal.In summary then, I have to admit that the production values and effects were certainly of the high standard expected from a Harry Potter film but I think the enjoyment of it really depends on how much a fan you are of the books. For the casual patron like myself who has seen the films but not bothered with the books, then you may find it a bit of a hard slog, but for the Harry Potter fans I think there is a lot to get excited about. And at the end of the day, surely these are the people this film should be aimed at.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
If Only They Would Fit the Movies to the Books...,"A very enjoyable movie and a great addition to the series - but I left the cinema wishing that they would fit the movies to the books rather than the other way around. My kids and I know going in that there will be large holes where sections of the novel couldn't be included due to time constraints, and we're resigned to this fact, however there is always a disappointment when some scenes don't appear on the screen. At least half of the disappointment is due to the excellent job the various directors and producers have done with casting the characters of the series so far; you tend to expect to see everything rendered in cinematic images to match or enhance the pictures you formed when reading the book. For example, there are frequent comments comparing Richard Harris to Michael Gambon. Michael Gambon suffers the fate of coming second in place - after most of us saw Richard Harris in the first film and thought 'Ah! Yes - THAT's Dumbledore!' The cinematic image matched the one in our minds. Now Michael Gambon - doing an excellent job in his own right - yet doesn't look like the image we agreed on... Therefore when some scene is not dramatized, or some moment is left out there's this vacuum of missing images and I guess the only way around that would be to make two movies, for example, of this book (which certainly deserves two movies). In a way it's a pity HBO didn't pick up the rights since they may have done a more complete treatment of the stories. When I compare these films with their many fascinating characters and story lines jammed into a couple of hours with other recent 'blockbuster' movies that surely were cookie-cut out of plastic, I can't help feeling cheated.All that aside, it's a fine movie and a lot of fun, even when the fun is quite dark. Harry is pretty intense these days, and Daniel Radcliffe does it well. Hermione and Ron don't really get a lot of screen time which is too bad since these actors have remained so consistent over the years that you could really believe they spend the time between movies in costume. Imelda Staunton does Dolores Umbridge to perfection, including a small squeak before she speaks that does more to signal the character's cheerfully evil nature than anything else.J.K. Rowling has done us all a great service with these stories and added some wonderful people to our universes; the directors and actors of the series have done a fine job of bringing them to the screen and my only regret is that 138 minutes is too short a time to be able to visit with all of them.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Harry Potter and the Abysmal Waste of Talent,"I have discovered tonight one of the reasons that I normally DON'T pay full price to see movies! I have just returned from seeing the latest Harry Potter movie adaptation, and suffice to say, I was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!! The Hollywood movie machine just keeps making progressively worse adaptations of J.K. Rowling's beloved books. I don't know who's making the decisions about this franchise, but whoever they are, obviously never read any of the books, or just doesn't CARE. I mean, who let this slipshod, hacked-up, cinematic Dungbomb get through? For those of you who ""just see the movies"", and have never read the books, or at least THIS one, you may or may not be disappointed. Those of you who complain that the ""movies are just too long"" will be happy, as this is the SHORTEST of all the HP adaptations yet. (Frankly, I just think that America's attention span in general is just TOO DAMN SHORT!) However, therein lies one of the reasons it was so awful. The general spirit of the book, that of The Ministry of Magic trying to quash rumors of Lord Voldemort's return, and the subsequent rebellion by Harry and company, is kept alive, but only to a certain point. I went into the movie expecting a whole hell of a lot more for my movie-going dollar than I got. I even had just finished rereading the book to refresh my mind on all the points of the plot, most of which were just.....not there!The movie's tone retains the darkness that was brought into the franchise in the third film. (Thank you, Alfonso Cuaron.) The special effects, makeup, and production design teams bring the world of Hogwarts to life with their usual sparkling results. First-time film director David Yates gets spot-on performances from the entire cast. (I still think that the Harry Potter franchise is one of the most perfectly cast in cinema.) Daniel Radcliffe turns in his usual well-done performance as the seemingly always put-upon Harry. HP newcomer Imelda Staunton is PERFECT as the Ministry of Magic's iron fist in Hogwarts, the deplorable Dolores Umbridge. Ironically enough, Staunton's performance was about the only GOOD thing about the movie. The rest of the cast, however, are almost reduced to extended cameos, as little screen time as they're given. Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley and Emma Watson's Hermione Granger could almost be part of the scenery, as could all the other members of ""Dumbledore's Army,"" including Evanna Lynch's performance as new character Luna Lovegood. The ""Order of the Phoenix"" referred to in the title might as well be just a boarding house for people who don't like the Ministry of Magic, for the little we see of it or its members. You'd think that the school year at Hogwarts lasted 2 months, for all we see of the classes! This movie is a waste of a whole lot of actors who've been in BETTER movies, including earlier chapters in this franchise. Aside from Radcliffe's Harry and Staunton's Dolores Umbridge, the rest of the cast might as well almost not be there for most of the movie.I think a good bit of the blame for this movie being so awful should go to the producers who let this movie get made into the mess that it is. MOST OF ALL, though, I place blame on the hacked-up screenplay by Michael Goldenberg. As not only a Harry Potter fan and reader in general, but also a knowledgeable movie buff, I do realize that SOME parts of every book must be excised from a movie adaptation for sake of continuity and time. This is one of those cases, however, where they took out TOO MUCH! Certain parts of the book which would have made the movie more cohesive have either been omitted, changed, or just plain hacked to shreds!! Goldenberg's script takes the soul out of the movie, and leaves you wanting too much for more. He took a beloved young adult novel, took a chainsaw to it, and put together what was left! This was like watching a bad ""Cliff's Notes"" version! I left the theatre thinking, ""Where's the rest of it?"" I mean, the only other movie adaptation that I can say was as BAD as this one, was last year's tragically done adaptation of Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code. (I only hope that more mercy is shown by the makers of the upcoming version of Angels & Demons.) Michael Goldenberg's screenplay isn't even a SHADOW of its source material, for what little was left in. I think that a severe injustice has been done to Rowling's work, and let's hope that in years to come, this will be a lesson to filmmakers as how NOT to do an adaptation! If this is where the Harry Potter movie franchise is going, count me OUT for Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows! Never has the phrase ""based on the novel by...."" been ABUSED in such a manner!",1.0,Anonymous,Action
final combat scene,"With such an overwhelming number of comments, I would like to emphasize only one thing which I think really deserves special praise: the final combat scene within the ministry is stunningly remarkable. The absolutely breath-taking rhythm, the way how a real ""mêlée"" within the wizarding world might look was portrayed, the extent to which the art of magic performed could be action-packed, all of these are realized to an indeed unprecedented - if not its nearly fullest, well, with at least two sequels awaiting - degree, which altogether make the whole of it not only totally fascinating but truly believable, to the extent that all of them seem to happen in a rather short amount of time. A masterpiece beyond, or even replenishing imagination. Simply adore it.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
"Better than expected, but only if you've read the book.","In this, the fifth instalment of the series, we find a very different Harry from before. Here, he is beset by insecurity and anger at the fact that he feels people and events are passing him by without his input. Is this normal teen angst or possibly is it Voldermort affecting his thoughts? Dumbledore has resurrected the Order of the Phoenix, a fighting force of wizards against Voldermort, but without much success.No one believes Harry about He Who Cannot Be Named returning, and the Ministry of Magic is out to cast doubt on Dumbledore and Harry. To this end they place a teacher of their own in to Hogwarts. Delores Umbridge starts a series of events designed to promote the Ministry and discredit any other view. Harry starts fighting back with a secret series of training sessions in Defence Against the Dark Arts.Throughout this time, Harry keeps getting visions which he thinks are due to his connection with Voldemort, and these lead to a spectacular ending involving a fight between the Order and Voldermorts Death Eaters inside the Ministry itself.Now to the actual film. The beginning is so disjointed, with jumps from scene to scene without any follow-up that at times it becomes difficult to follow. Many story lines are shown as annoying spinning headlines from the Daily Prophet newspaper, and so much of the book is cut from the first half that several people sitting around us in the theatre complained that they had lost the plot within the first 45 minutes.Fortunately, the last half of the film is more stable but there are so many changes, scene swaps, plot losses and more that as a stand alone film without having read the book, I'm afraid it just doesn't make the grade.Far better than the Goblet of Fire and a good attempt to fit an 800+ page book into under 2 1/2 hours, but because there are so many things happening in the books that don't appear in the films, I'm concerned that book 7 might throw some spanners in the works as to the things that have been skipped.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"Poor compared to the Goblet of Fire film, but still pretty good.","I have not been a huge fan of any of the Potter films except for the fourth, and this wasn't as good. This Potter entry deals with a new professor of the dark arts, Mrs. Umbridge coming on, and she takes over the school pretty fast becoming headmaster. Meanwhile Harry, Ron and Hermoine get an army of kids together to fight Voldemort who has returned. Like most Potter films, this doesn't explain itself enough, so quite often if you haven't read the books, this will have you scratching your head. The acting, as always, was very good and all the kids and old British actors did a great job. One good thing that this movie has is it almost has a small time feel. Though there are many scenes with special effects, it is nowhere near as special effect heavy as the the last four, and it also has smaller sets and less characters. Plus, this is a long book, and the movie runs at 128 minutes without credits making it the shortest of the movies. It was good, but it could've been better.My rating: *** out of ****. 128 mins. PG-13 for violence.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"Man, I really HATED this movie completely!","I'm a fan of good fantasy movies, but so far everyone of the five Harry Potter movies have been fairly dull, boring, and incomplete.Only the first two films, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, and Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets have been fairly accurate to the books.Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was a shortened version of a fairly long book, and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was an even shorter version of the book.However each of those two films had something that is seriously missing in the latest movie: excitement.The latest Harry Potter film, Order of the Phoenix takes the longest book and makes it into the shortest movie.I have read the book, but even still with all of the constant editing, I have never been more bored in my entire life. I just wanted this film to end.Order of the Phoenix is the worst of the already boring and bland Harry Potter series of books.",1.0,Anonymous,Action
This is the best of the Harry Potter films yet,"Part five of the enormously popular Harry Potter machine has kicked off today and it does not disappoint. If you've seen the other 4 films that is. But if you're somebody who likes watching event films, regardless of continuity, then this is the film for you as well.The story, like the previous 4 films, captured the essence of the books. That's definitely saying a lot due to the volume of the actual book. Sure, the writers had to take some of the subplots out and even added a few of their own in the story, but all in all, it didn't take anything away from the Harry Potter nostalgia. I loved seeing Tonks, Kreacher, Grawp, the Thestrals, Luna Lovegood, Bellatrix Lestrange and of course, Dolores Umbridge for the first time. And even if I've read the books more than once, it's still fun to see the story unfold on the big screen.In the acting department, the kids definitely have more than improved. Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter has shown more depth to the character. Gone is the bright eyed Harry that we've seen and read in book one and in comes the dark, troubled, and distant Harry. It's definitely a taste of things to come in the eventual 7th and final film. Evanna Lynch aka Luna ""Looney"" Lovegood did a commendable performance as well. All I liked about Looney, Ms.Lynch got right through her weirdness, her blunt honesty, and her carefree nature. But the actor that took the show away without a doubt would be Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge. Ms.Staunton had Umbridge, who is by far my most hated character of all the Potter Universe, down pat. To say she aced this role is an understatement. I absolutely despised her. Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange, although shown briefly, did a great job as well. The rest of the adults, true to form, showed their consistent acting prowess. Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore, Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort,  Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Maggie Smith as Minerva McGonagall and of course, Gary Oldman as Sirius Black did their parts like it was written for them almost 10 years ago when J.K.Rowling thought about the Harry Potter universe while waiting at the train station.The effects, as expected from an event movie like this, is up to snuff. From the Thestrals which could be seen only by people who has encountered death, to Tonks' color changing hair, from Kreacher's mumbling to Grawp's grunting, from the basic wand flicking done by the students of Hogwarts up till the eventual Voldemort vs Dumbledore finale, whatever you thought of in your mind while reading the book, the effects wizards made it happen.Having said all of that, this is the best of the Harry Potter films yet. It's worth every minute. Just make sure to be patient with people who know nothing about the series and tell them that you'll explain everything after the flick. Nobody likes to hear chattering while watching a movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Order of the Phoenix - Best Potter Yet!,"I saw the first Harry Potter film amidst a flurry of criticism that kids were being taught ""Witchcraft"" through these stories. Highly Unlikely, and rubbish. I guess the purple Teletubby is also gay and evil, as is Barney the Dinosaur. J.K. Rowling has created something that most American moviegoers do not grasp very well- English Humour and Morals. These movies show that anything can be used for bad, or good, whether it is ""magic"" or Technology- And are an encouragement for kids to always use any advantages they have to do the right thing. Therefore, the Jerry-Fallwellian idea that kids are badly influenced by the Potter series must be discarded.In the films, these stories are rapidly changing from Kiddie stories, to exquisite interesting young adult mysteries- And I like the way the kids are growing up. What I really enjoyed about this one, is the return of several of my favourite characters. Mad Eye Moody, Padfoot, Remus Lupin, Professor Trelawney, Hagrid, and even Lucius Malfoy and my favourite, Ralph Fiennes as ""He who must be not be named"" - Everything about this film is done well, and as always I love the little vignettes at the beginning of each Potter movie, where there is always something that tries to prevent Potter from returning to Hogwart's. I especially liked this one... And the interaction between Potter and his cousin. Eventually Potter will have to have it out with The Dursleys, and this will be something that I will savor when it comes to pass.There are a couple of things that are not explained... That archway? What was that? I suppose there was a reason why there was an Archway in the center of the department of mysteries... And why there was a pointed lack of discussion about it, except for Hermione's passive comment about the voices she could net hear (But we know Harry could hear them).When I saw the first two Harry Potter films, I thought 'He who must not be named was to be the perennial antagonist, like Lex Luthor and Superman. But so far the progress of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named's attempts to come back to the land of flesh have been from slightly irritating to very deadly. In this film the malevolence takes full adult form, and Potter deals with it in a mature way. And so it is not just about a silly little kid now... It is about a young man who has been confronted by darkness, who makes the best of the lot he has been given, embraces his friends, and asks all the questions about life any boy who is growing up would ask... And basically, that would be, in Potter's case, ""Am I Turning Bad?""And if this movie, and the books and films based on the books, are filled with bad things, then I suppose Harry Potter would not be asking Dumbledore... ""Am I turning bad?"" - So instead of a manual for kids to learn magic spells, I rather see the Potter series as an entertaining way for kids to be influenced in a positive way. Who are the children that read and watch Harry Potter books going to imitate... Harry Potter, or Draco Malfoy?Beginning with Prisoner of Azkeban, the films took a more mature and malevolent turn. I'd say the 3rd movie was the turning, and the ending of Goblet of Fire movie was hideously, fantastically, dark, leading directly to Order of the Phoenix.And so all 4 of those stories set the tone for Order of the Phoenix, and the first half of the movie, I feel Potter's frustration, which is magnified by Professor/Undersecretary of Magic Umbrich. (I love cats, but any woman who has a collection of CAT-PLATES on her wall, er, has got Problems!)It took me about 3 years to realise that I Love these stories, and I almost do not want read the books, because I am used to the stories unfolding the way Chris Columbus told us the first 2... Alfonso Cuarón gave the series a sharp NUDGE into the surreal with Prisoner of Azkeban, Followed by the slap in the face we get from Mike Newell in Goblet of Fire: David Yates had really no problem building on what had gone before, and he reminds us in most forceful way of the events following The Prisoner of Azkeban... So now a momentum has built up, and regardless of who directs the next film, all the pieces are now set in place.... (Except for the Womping Willow, where is the Womping Willow?)My One Complaint is that movies 4 and 5 are desperately Lacking in Quiddich...",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Congrats David Yates!,"In 1997 JK Rowling introduced to the world a small eleven-year-old boy who discovers that he is a wizard. Fast forward to today (seven books, five films later) this boy, Harry Potter, is one of the biggest phenomenons of today. With an amazing book series and four brilliant films to the résumé, will the newest film, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" still have that ""Harry Potter"" magic? To this reviewer's surprise, considering that the book was his least favorite, the movie was one of the best of the series.Harry returns to his fifth year at Hogwarts full of ill fortune. Few of students and parents believe him, or Dumbledore, that Voldemort is back. The Ministry of Magic had decided to step in by appointing a new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, Delores Umbridge, which proves to be the nastiest person Harry has ever encountered. To top it off, Harry is having some mysterious dreams featuring Voldemort. Can Harry Potter survive his toughest year at Hogwarts yet?If you are a hardcore Harry Potter nerd you will probably trash this movie to pieces. There are a lot of missing subplots but if you have watched any of the Harry Potter movies, or any book adaptations for that matter, you will realize that most adaptations is not 100% the book. Just look at the runtime, 2 Hrs and 18 minutes (the shortest of the films), and you would realize that it would have been impossible to fit all 870 pages. They cut out some good sub plots, for example: zero references to Quidditch, but they kept the theme of the book intact and that is what this reviewer wanted and hoped for as a companion to the book.The acting was amazing. There should be props given out to David Yates for getting the best performances out of the young actors, especially Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley). For the first time, it felt like Ron Weasley was more then just the butt of the jokes. The veteran actors (Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Garry Oldman, Emma Thompson, and others) are always great. The newest additions: Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix), newcomer, Evanna Lynch (Luna Lovegood), Natalia Tena (Nymphadora Tonks) were also great. The best was Imelda Staunton as Professor Umbridge. She pulled off her villainous role so well that you hate her more then Voldemort.This is the most mature of the series. As the book series continues, as well as the movies, it gets darker and the same goes for this film. There are also many themes about how everyone has their own dark side and how you can fight your own dark side. Though it is the most adult of the series, the kids can see it and enjoy it too. If you expect a big action packed film, with many special effects, you might be bored with this movie because it concentrates most on the characters and the story.The action and the special effects are amazing. They introduce Hagrid's half-brother giant named Grawp. There is also an introduction to Thestrals, which are these skeletal horses with wings. The action is not much until the climax of the story at the Department of Mysteries, so if you expect a big action packed, special effects film, as they showed in the trailers, you will be disappointed. Nonetheless, the climax is very thrilling with all of the wizardry battles and it gave a ""Star Wars"" type feel.Overall if you are a fan of the series, you should like it. However, as this reviewer has mentioned earlier, if you are a die hard Harry Potter freak who wants everything in the book and complains when something is different you will not like this. There is very little this reviewer does not like about this movie besides the absence of Quidditch. Go see it because this reviewer is sure you will enjoy it. This reviewer hopes that David Yates will continue his magic on the next installment, ""Half Blood Prince."" One big warning: if you want to get into Harry Potter, do not start with this film. The story does rely on your knowledge of the previous installments and does not work as a stand-alone film like the others.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Harry Potter and Teenage Angst,"""Harry Potter"" is an escape from reality. I love to sit down with a cup of hot chocolate and let my mind drift to the wizarding world. Of the first five films, this one has been the hardest one to get through. Though the core plot is strong, and I care about what is happening to the characters, the whole tone is a drag.Harry is depressed. Harry is angry. Harry is ignored. While the strongest elements of the first four films were in the castle, I found myself least interested when the characters were at Hogwarts. Dumbledore's Army is fantastic and helps elevate an otherwise frustrating year of school.Frustrations aside, Harry's relationship with Sirius is a highlight of this film. I love seeing their bond and friendship on display. This film also introduces two of the most hated villains in the franchise in Umbridge and Bellatrix. I think what this film was really missing was some quidditch.I have a deep love for the world of Harry Potter, but this movie, along with the book, are too full of teenage angst for me to fully enjoy it.Best Character: Sirius Black

Best adaptation of an HP yet,"I thought Order of the Phoenix was the best adaption of any of the HP books as of yet. It's a big book to tackle, that's for sure. But the writers and director uses tricks such as quick flashbacks and cutaways to condense the book into a mere 2 hours and 20mins. If I wasn't so tired at 2:30am last night I would have wanted more. And still I'd love for a directors cut when the double discs come out at Christmas time. Was it a perfect movie? No, but as an avid reader it was a perfect adaption of one of my favorite books. Again add an hour to it please, it would have been much better. I can't fault OOP though, this was the best installment so far. The angst and darkness of Harry's situation was played perfectly.Some things that bothered me and of course spoiler warning abound: The use of Ginny Weasley and her ""Strong powers."" I'm guessing the slight nudge to the 6th book was needed there, for those of who know nuff said. But please, it's well known that Hermione is one of the most remarkable witches of her generation, probably the best. To have Ginny generating immense power, and packing a huge punch while Hermione can barely produce a spark is insulting. Let's stop with the insinuations here and stick to the facts instead of Ship preferences.That was my only gripe. Other than that this was a service to the fans of the books and nothing more. I'm sorry if those of you still didn't get it, then go out and read the series you may be clued in. But I'm guessing those who felt disjointed with HP were prolly feeling out of the loop. And rightly so, this was one of the first movies as of yet to be a totally fan-service.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Another good Harry Potter film...,"More than 10 years after the publication of the first book in the ""Harry Potter"" series, there's no doubt that J. K. Rowling's fantasy novels are on the way of becoming classics of the genre due to its imaginative world and its captivating story, which has gone from simple tales of adventure to darker and more complex themes as its main character, the young wizard Harry Potter grows up. The fourth installment of the series, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" began this maturing process, as in that book our hero discovered that fighting against evil, embodied in the figure of Lord Voldemort, wasn't a child's game, as the forces of evil do not hesitate in killing innocents. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", fifth novel in the series, continued and expanded this transformation, and naturally, the movie adaptation followed the same path.As usual, we find Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) spending the summer at the house of his hateful relatives, the Dursleys, however, something feels different this time, as even when he was the one who discovered that Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) had returned, nobody, not even his good friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), had attempted to get in touch with him. Harry suspects something strange is going on, and his suspicion gets confirmed when a group of Dementors attack him and his cousin Dudley (Harry Melling), forcing him to use magic to save him. After this event, Harry is informed that he is now expelled from Hogwarts, however, the Order of the Phoenix, a group of elite wizards lead by Harry's former professor Alastor Moody (Brendan Gleeson), appear at the Dursleys' house to take Harry away. It seems that Harry's fifth year has started a bit earlier this time.Replacing Steve Kloves as scriptwriter for ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is writer Michael Goldenberg, who faces the mammoth challenge of adapting Rowling's longest book to film. As any fan of the series should expect, details from the novel had to be omitted, but it must be said that Goldenberg manages to create a script that despite the omissions remains true to the story's spirit by keeping the core themes and staying faithful to the main plot. One of the key elements of the novel's plot is Harry's angst, and Goldenberg manages to successfully explore this aspect in his screenplay, devoting a great deal of it to the developing of Harry's character (something missing in the previous installment). Sadly, this has the consequence of limiting the screen time of the rest of the characters, as even major character such as Ron and Hermione get reduced screen time in this occasion.As the new person in the director's seat, David Yates wisely decide to keep a sense of continuity between films and follows the same dark visual style that has been part of the series since the third installment (""Prisoner of Azkaban""), keeping the film in tone with the more mature challenges the characters face now that they have grown up and the evil's presence is stronger. A major theme in the movie is how the life at Hogwarts is affected by the many political conspiracies to hide the fact that Voldemort has returned, and fortunately Yates manages to pay enough attention to this aspect without taking the focus out of the main characters. While Yates does give his film a very fast pace, he manages to make the story easy to understand even to those unfamiliar with the novel and the many details that weren't included in the adaptation.One of the most noticeable things in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is definitely how much has Daniel Radcliffe improved as an actor, as after many years of being the weakest link in the young trio, he finally shows up a considerable development and a real domain over dramatic scenes. Of course, it helps a lot that the script is almost entirely dedicated to his character, although sadly, this also means that Emma Watson and specially Rupert Grint receive almost zero chance to shine, although both make great performances despite this. The rest of the supporting characters suffer of this same thing as well, although Michael Gambon, Emma Thompson and specially Alan Rickman deliver remarkable acting despite the short screen time they have. However, the highlight of the film is Imelda Staunton's acting as Dolores Umbridge, as she delivers what's simply an unforgettable performance.As written above, anyone expecting a faithful adaptation of the books will be sorely disappointed. To expect the level of detail Kloves and director Chris Columbus had in the first two films is simply pointless, but that doesn't mean Yates and Goldenberg are not talented, one has consider that since ""Prisoner of Azkaban"", Rowling's seres has grown bigger and deeper than the first two books. True, it's sad not to see some of the most famous scenes of the series in the movie, but what Yates and Goldenberg have done is still impressive as the movie does exactly what the novel did in a flawless way: it gives depth to the characters and completes their transition from kids to teenagers. In fact, the movie's real problem is that it's a bit too fast paced for its own sake, with the events happening at times too quickly to be noticed. I'm sure nobody would complain if 20 extra minutes were added to help slow the pace a bit.""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" may not be an adaptation as faithful as hardcore fans would want, but in the end the approach the filmmakers have taken since the third chapter has given the series an identity of its own. This fifth installment is a great addition to the series, as it delivers perfectly the intended message: Harry Potter is not a kid anymore, and his biggest challenge awaits ahead. 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Action

It is aimed at people around 15-17. But it also appeals to older people - like me. Especially if you like fantasy - like me.I also do love the combination of comedy (which is usually appearing a lot in the first half of the movies), and the dark and serious notes of the Harry Potter movies.

"Not too shabby, not all that great","I went to see this film today, and although i must congratulate David Yates on some good directing in some places, overall it felt to me as if i sat through 2 hours of nothing.The cinematography I must say has certainly improved from the older films, and it felt a lot more ""real"" to me, especially in the first few things, and not only that but the special effects it has to be said, were spectacular.A downside of the film though, is that it doesn't stand out as a film. If you haven't read the books, some parts may become completely lost on you, and there certainly isn't enough plot explanation. I feel as though the film brought nothing new that could not be gained from the book on its own, it didn't make anything ""click"" for me, which i didn't get in the books, and brought nothing new to the table, and although this sounds cliché, but the book is most definitely in this case better, and the film certainly went a way in ruining the book for me.Not to continue slating the film, but at some points also, i truly had to cringe at some of the acting. In some places it felt very awkward, almost razored as if the actors hadn't truly grasped what was happening, although Rickman was superb as always, maintaining a character we have seen for 4 films already, and this will obviously be needed in the next film also.One good point is that this film certainly contained a lot more laughs than the others, something i thought i would never see in the Harry Potter series, and although I personally do not think the feat of the film was truly accomplished, i would still suggest going to see it yourself, especially if you don't hold yourself as a large fan of the books.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
The Best Potter Movie Yet!,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix had a difficult job from the beginning; Harry is an emotional and unhappy boy throughout. He is now 15 years old and the hormones are kicking in. Oh, and it doesn't help that Lord Voldemort has returned and is trying to control his mind, all while a teacher from Hell has taken over Defense Against the Dark Arts... along with a few other things. By the end of this year, Harry and his friends have to take matters into their own hands. Fortunately, the Order of the Phoenix, a society bent on destroying Voldemort, is right behind them.Director David Yates does a wonderful job with what was probably the most complex book. His vision is very obviously different from the previous three directors, but it just might be the best. As a die-hard fan of the books, I expect a lot out of the movies- Luckily they just keep getting better. This one is the best so far.One has to give some credit for that to Imelda Staunton playing that teacher from Hell I spoke of: Professor Umbridge. She is absolutely perfect, and her performance is Oscar-worthy. Doubtful she'll have a chance, but I'm definitely rooting for Best Supporting Actress. Her interpretation of this character is so spot on, so evil through fake niceness, she inspires fantastic performances from the returning actors around her. They are all back at the top of their game with this one, in particular Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman as Professors McGonagall and Snape, respectively. The scene between Professor McGonagall and Professor Umbridge is one of the most intense in the movie. The other cast member who shines the brightest is Gary Oldman as Harry's godfather, Sirius Black. He just might have you in tears by the end.And there are some pretty intense scenes here. The last 30 minutes of the movie will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time. It's fantastic film-making. The action sequences are done wonderfully, and the dramatic scenes are wonderful, too. The only downfall is that the film starts out pretty slow and can seem long at times. All in all, though, Mr. Yates has done a fine job with the story, and I hope he's back for the next round. I know I'll be there Opening Night. 7/10 stars!Jay Addison",7.0,Anonymous,Action
My Order of the Phoenix comments,"First of all, I have to agree wholeheartedly with the previous person and would like to add some more.I thought the original casting of Richard Harris for Dumbledore was spot on - he was the exact image I had of him from reading the books and I loved his gentle quietness and yet very powerful demeanour. When I saw Michael Gambon for the first time, I thought...noooooo - it's all wrong - but as an adult I knew they were not going to be able to replace the late Richard Harris and to try to do so would have been futile - so they had to come up with a more ""off the wall"" character. It took me several years and countless viewings of Azkaban and Goblet to finally find that he has now grown on me. Thank god! Daniel, Emma and Rupert's acting abilities have certainly come a long way from what I thought was a bit robotish, reading off script to now a much more flowing sense of ease - growing into their characters and yes, showing by expression rather than words alone - they have done well. One thing in particular is Daniel's acting of emotional pain - he does that so well. Always brings tears to my eyes and a painful churning in my stomach. He achieved that also as the character of Jack, in ""My Boy Jack"" too. Very Well Done Dan! I think the films version of the kiss was actually better than the book - I think the books portrayal of Harry being so confudled by the idea of girls at the age of 15 is a bit out of date - boys are much more ""with it"" at that age - and this is where the film gets the vote for that scene, he comes across a bit more like a 15 year old boy would.I only have one real disappointment - considering it is the longest book of the series, it so far is the shortest film at 2 hours 16 mins and it is because of this it gets my criticism. There was so much in this book that it definitely should have been a three hour film. So much was left out - important stuff that will affect the next two films. I really would love to have the people who decided on the length and what should be in it to tell me what the reason was behind it. It certainly cant be money - Warner Bros on a budget? I don't think so. It couldn't be because they thought kids couldn't sit still for three hours - as we know the books grow with kids, so its older ones watching it. So what on earth could the answer be? Deadline on the production causing them to cut scenes out? Actors being committed to other projects? Please someone give me a justified reason to why this film was so short and therefore compromised some vital elements. And please someone reassure me that this wont happen with the last two films.There, that's my only moan - effects - brilliant, scenery - fantastic, music - fantastic.All in all, 99.9% perfect. I have to be loyal!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
it was OK .,"Personally being a huge fan of harry potter, and never has there been a book yet that i haven't read more than once, i found this film to be rather rushed and quite honestly too much.Although not remotely dull at any point, the film payed very little attention to detail and rushed through what i imagine being every 4th chapter of the book. They cut far too much out of the book to make the film and in the end skipped from scene to scene far to fast.If they had made the film just a little bit longer and had perhaps put in just a little more detail in the ministry it could've been much better instead of a 30 second wander around before all hell breaking loose.if, unlike me, you have seen the film and not read the books therefore had not quite the same expectations this film would have been great.it is truly an amazing film, but not enough adapted to the epic book itself.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Quite possibly the best of the series,"It's quite amazing to see the direction the Harry Potter franchise has come since the cheery, yet unyieldingly faithful Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone. Although liberties have been taken with the text, with things shifted around or deleted altogether (with the source material over 900 pages, I hardly think anyone's complaining), the latest installment of the Harry Potter series offers some of the most entrancing moments of the year.In Order of the Phoenix, Harry's world becomes decidedly more violent and vulnerable. Nothing seems as secure as it did before. This is a sign of two things: a changing world, and all the joys of growing up. Both are developed very well. In fact, I'd go as far as saying Harry enjoyed more character development in this movie than in at least two of the other movies combined. We also get to see brief glimpses of development in other characters including Ginny Weasley, Sirius Black, and Professor Snape.It's hard to come by such an outstanding cast as what was mustered for this movie. Not only are all the veterans showing their mettle, but the newly christened actors of tomorrow are keeping up with them. The three child leads, though not so child anymore, are expectedly improving with age, but I think the improvement was most evident in this movie. New additions to the cast were all wisely made, especially Imelda Staunton as Professor Umbridge, who stole scenes as the school's new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.Wise decisions were made all around, but as always there are little things missing here and there that could have made the movie even greater. One of my favorite things about the movie, however, is how it keeps referring to the previous movies. With all the movies differing from each other so much, it was nice to see the filmmakers taking some initiative and trying to wrap them together to make the story feel a little less uneven and bring some continuity to the franchise.Hardcore fans of the book will probably be disappointed, but I think, with a few changes, this is about the best you could hope for. Any faults are no means on the actors or production crew, who all do an outstanding job, but on those whose decision it lies to make these movies continuously shorter than the previous one.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Focuses more on conflicts than characters,"For me, this was a huge disappointment. The other reviewers talking about how the movie lost its sense of magic and wonder are absolutely right. Take the effect that Steven Spielberg creates in his movies and reverse it, and you'll have an idea of what I'm talking about.I think the problem is the lack of focus on the characters. Each of the previous movies spent a lot of time letting you get to know each of the new characters and learning to hate or appreciate them. Since the books are highly character driven, I think it was appropriate.In this movie though, I think they focused more on the conflicts than the characters. As a result, the movie pushed forward at a good clip, but I didn't particularly care what happened.Overall, I think Yates lacks a sense of story and what it means to draw the audience into the world you've created. He's created something that looks like a Lifetime movie, not a member of one of the greatest stories of all time. He betrays the magic of the world, the magic of the characters, and the wonderment of magic itself -- destroying everything I held dear about the franchise.If he directs the next movie, I will almost certainly wait until it comes out on video. Otherwise, it's not worth it.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
"Not the book, but one of the best","While the book is still one of the best in the series and the movie isn't as good as the book, it is without a doubt one of the best in the series. It takes you through the story giving you the most important parts of the book.The action is non stop. The performances by the seasoned but young cast keeps getting better. They truly show they are capable of handling the emotional complexities of the characters, not just the main three but all of the others.The time simply flew by and I could have easily sat for another hour or more. Gary Oldman as Sirius will be missed (of course Sirius is missed in the books as well).I look forward to seeing this film at least twice more in the theater.

The plot is sometime weird and sometime not very coherent, but the final outcome remains the same.A well-crafted growing up movie, for the main characters and their audience. Now it is much faster to binge grow up with harry potter's movies, but then it was so precise.The cast remains full with enormous actors and actresses and the movie hangs on still with great music, action sequences and respected visual effects.Moving forward to the next one and enjoying each one of them separately.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
The Rebellion Begins,"As another year begins for Harry, at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry so does the never-ending articles stating that he and Dumbledore are insane. As the ministry starts to invent new and malicious lies about Harry's account on Voldemort's return, Hogwarts begins to change for the worse as the ministry sends in their cure for all the insanity, Professor Dolores Jane Umbridge. As she begins to inflict her rules and regulations on the students at Hogwarts they begin to find that with her as their teacher, they'll never be ready for the outside world.So Harry along with his friends decides to take things into their own hands and begin to learn magic the real way. As Harry starts having visions of terrible events happening with the Ministries very walls he decides to take action, leading himself and his friends into battle, ultimately teaching them what friendship, loyalty and sacrifice really means.You know how crazy the trailer and TV spots are, showing all the good parts in the film? Yeah, that got me very excited for the film. I set a very high expectation for this film. Maybe a little bit too high. With each film getting better and better by each entry, this one is the worse, by far, although it is still a great film.Maybe the mistake is a new writer (Michael Goldenberg)? Or maybe the film is too short? Ironically, this is the longest book in the series but the shortest running time. I felt that the movie was rushed, trying to fit everything in the short 2 hour and 10 minutes it has. The editing is very noticeable.With that being said, this movie goes straight to the point, like Fantastic Four 2, which is encouraging for people who haven't read the films and discouraging for fans of Harry Potter. Yeah, it talks more of the plot but most of the fun in the previous four films are taken out and more depressing things are added in.Why can't they have made it a three hour movie? I'm sure people don't mind it. For a person who have read the books, they have cut out many important elements. Another bad thing from the running time is the short appearances made by brilliant cast members. For example, blink and Sybil Trelawney (wonderfully played by Emma Thompson) might be gone. Same goes for Alan Rickman's performance on Snape.No doubt this film might be liked by some and disliked by others and that the film is the darkest and most visaulistic yet. The visual effects are even better and seamless. The action sequences, less in this film, are good but not better than the last film. The music, although different, isn't up to par with the previous films.I like the new look of the film. Obviously, each director has their own perspective on the world of Harry Potter and I would love to see another director making another new look for this series. It's refreshing and not repetitive.The main three cast members have grown mature over their roles, most notably Daniel Radcliffe, who gives a great performance. Another person who gives a brilliant performance is Imelda Staunton. She is the perfect role for Dolores Umbridge! And how about the kissing scene? Well, just watch the movie for yourself.Although not the best movie in the series, it is certainly a worthy sequel. The film is magical. The look of it is great. If you're a fan, you might be disappointed or you might like it. For an average movie goer, you'll notice nothing and that's probably the reason you'll love it.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Harry Grows And Doubts,"I did not read this book, I know, you hate me. But I can review on the movie on a sole-movie-based-point-of-view. It was good. Because I knew it was sort of a bridge book, I didn't expect too much action, not like the last one, at least.Harry in this one was pissy. He wonders at one point if he is evil, and my friend turned to me to whisper, 'he's not evil, he's a teenage boy'. That's a pretty good idea of what this movie is. It's about a teenage boy charged with saving the world and his own doubts on whether or not he can do it- if he'll let anyone in to help him. In this movie Harry is not the young hero he was in the first or second, or even the premature teen trying to save Hogwarts like he was in the third or forth. In this movie Harry begins to grow up, which means he has his doubts. This movie focused more on how he was going to get through it all. Oh, and that infamous kiss scene.All-in-all, it was worthwhile, even if you haven't read all the books. (It was a heackuva lot better than Pirates 3, and I'll bet you saw THAT if you're from ten to twenty-five.)Good movie, good plot, thanks J.K. R.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Good but too rushed.,"I have said it once and I will say it again. You can not successfully make a book into a movie that is that long if you do you wind up with this where the movie leaves so much out of the book thats its almost a complete failure. Though Im sure if you never read the books this would be a fine movie but after reading the books these movies just seem more and more rushed.This movies takes place after their warning about Lord Voldemort's return scoffed at, Harry and Dumbledore are targeted by the Wizard authorities as an authoritarian bureaucrat slowly seizes power at Hogwarts.This was a decent movie and the acting and special effects are getting so much better but its just so disappointing to see some of my favorite series of book be rushed like this. And I understand its hard to do so each movie would have to be 5 hours to be a decent replecation of the book and that can not be done. Which is why these movies probably shouldn't have been made in the first place.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
This is not the book.,"First, I'd like to start by saying that I haven't read the book. I refuse to read any of the books until I have finished seeing all the movies, so that I don't waste time picking apart minor detail inconsistencies. I am judging this movie by its value as a movie, not its accuracy to the book.Everything about this movie was great: the acting was top notch, the music was more than fitting, the set design was stellar, the lighting was top notch... I could go on and on about what was done right during production, but the writing (something typically done during preproduction) was better than everything else that this movie did right combined. Though I don't know how closely this movie sticks to Rowling's original story, I do know that many of the ""haters"" are wrong.I've heard from people who have read the book that the plot doesn't flow well in the movie. This is not true at all; the flow may have been different but it was very good. I've heard that certain scenes which were omitted from the book make the movie difficult to understand. This is also incorrect; even though I haven't been exposed to these missing scenes, I understood the movie perfectly. I've heard that mistakes were made in the writing of the movie which cause large continuity errors. I did not notice any continuity errors either within the movie or to previous movies in the series.This is the first (maybe not last, but probably) time I've ever walked out of a movie at the theater thinking to myself ""This is the best movie I've ever seen."" Purists can feel free to complain all they want, but this remains an excellent movie. Not having read the book, I can neither confirm or deny that the book was better than the movie, but I can say without a doubt that this film is a must see for anybody who is old enough to handle it and is familiar (or is willing to become familiar) with the previous Harry Potter stories.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
disappointing but it has it's moments,"The fifth chapter in the Harry Potter books and film Order of the Phoenix was the weakest of the five films to date for many reasons: the book version was too long and dragged in certain parts, the movie version felt too short and too many gaps that left a lot of unanswered questions. First, I will start off by saying what I didn't like about the film: returning cast members Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson, David Thewlis, Fiona Shaw, Richard Griffiths, Brendon Glesson, and Julie Walters were completely underused. Other things I didn't like was some of the unanswered question like Percy alienating himself from his parents due to his beliefs of Fudge and the Ministry, Very little between the Harry and Cho relationship even though Daniel Radcliffe and Katie Leung are great kissers. Vernon's resentment of Harry was not shown, Petunia' feelings towards Harry and her sister were not mentioned. Trewlaney 's prediction of the Prophecy was not shown, Ron's qudditch scenes were cut, no mention of Ron and Hermione being prefects in the film. Fred and George's frustration of Hogwarts was not show even though their escape was seen.No mention of Dora Tonks being a shape shifter was ever mentioned or the duel between SIrus and Bellatrix. The best parts of the film were Imelda's Staunton's performance as the wicked Dolores Jane Umbridge and getting the feeling of her office with the pink Lace and curtains and even the cats were well done. Another good thing about the film was Helena Bonaham Carter's performance as the insane Bellatrix Lestrange cousin of Sirus Black even though she was underused. Gary Oldman was given more on screen time after barely being scene in the Goblet of Fire and bonded really well with Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have really matured as actors and work well together. Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom was given an expanded role and has really shined well, turning from a comedic relief character to a brave wizard. The Order of the Phoenix could have been a much longer film with more character development. Definitely a much darker film.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Order of the Phoenix delivers!!!!!,"I had a bad feeling about OOTP because of its length.2 1/2 hours just seemed too short.But stuff that feeling,this was a darn good movie.There might have been a lot cut out from the book but it was brilliantly adapted into a movie.Acting was fantastic,the best it has ever been,especially that of Imelda Staunton as Umbridge which was the standout.Special effects were again satisfactory as was the set design.A new thing about the movie is it didn't feel like a kids movie anymore.It was much darker and more violent.I still can't get over the fact that Harry,Hermionie and so on looked a lot older than in previous films.This could be a bit of a spoiler but the fight scene at the end of the movie is terrific so readers,look forward to the end.Overall an absolutely terrific piece of work and surpasses Pirates of the Caribbean 3 as my favourite movie of 2007.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"Watching young actors grow up during a very successful franchise is enjoyable to watch I think. Not only are they maturing physically, but you can tell at times that their acting is maturing as well. And although these kids have been doing it for six years, it seems as though they're still having fun with the characters they play. The same goes for the older generation of actors, but instead of growing up, they're the ""type-casting"" game. With two movies left to go and all three of the main children signed up to film them, will the older actors sign as well? Or will they decide to move onto something new before they're forever known as Severus Snape or Minerva McGonagall? Having said that, I believe the characters are pretty much the only interesting part about the film itself. The film moves slow at first, but picks up near the middle when all the pieces begin to come together. Unfortunately, the puzzle doesn't seem quite finished when all is said and done. However, it is only the fifth film in the series of seven and it begins to look more like the beginning of a trilogy than septilogy (yes, that's a series of seven), so pieces are left out to be explained in the next film and, hopefully, wrapped completely by the end of movie number seven.What's nice about the Harry Potter franchise is that it drops you in right at the beginning assuming you've seen the previous films, so they don't have to explain what has previously happened. The transitions, though, seem choppy and you are sometimes forced to understand how characters get from one place to another with no explanation from the script. The pace itself though, was nice and I don't think there was ever a scene that didn't interrupt the story's flow. David Yates, first time director to the series and first blockbuster, brought an interesting take to the film. With very little close-ups and panoramic visions, Yates continues to stabilize what the previous directors had already established.Overall, ""Order of the Phoenix"" is a nice segue into what is leading up to a certain, and possibly extraordinary, finale. In these next two films, I'm sure ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"" will prove a worthy adversary for our main protagonists, but for now, we, as the audience, will need to see them mature enough to be able to carry the story the rest of the way.Review by Glenn D.

The most bold and daring Harry Potter movie as of yet.,"Lots of people at the time praised ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" for its dark approach and atmosphere. Well, if ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was a dark movie, than this is an ultra-dark movie. ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was a semi-dark children/fantasy movie that never really dared to cross the line. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is not afraid to this though. I must say that this movie is actually closer to horror than fantasy in my opinion. It had an incredible atmosphere, with also some classic build up horror moments. There is little room left for fun in this movie and it's all very serious. Yes, perhaps a bit too serious though. I felt that the movie could had used some relieving humor at times, something all of the other Harry Potter movies were still loaded with.No, I'm not a great Harry Potter fan and never will be probably, but I have to give it credit for some thing. The series perfectly adapt to the maturing of the main characters as well as the viewers/readers. In other children book series the readers/viewers of course mature over the years, but the stories don't mature with them and everything remains just the same as the first book/movie. I praise the Harry Potter series for not doing so.So the movie is quite different from any of the previous other Harry Potter movies. It has a new style, which provides the movie with a different atmosphere. This is being empathized all the more by the different musical score from the still unknown Nicholas Hooper. I liked this idea. A new approach calls for a new style, also in the music. None of the themes sound familiar or reminds us of any of the other previous Harry Potter movies.The movie is more political than fun. The whole taking over Hogwarts thing by the ministry was done quite nicely and interesting. Harry and friends need to face some serious grown up difficulties now. Voldermort is back, no doubt, which means that there now needs to be fought in a battle between life and death. So no giant spiders, house elves, games of quidditch, brewing potions behind closed doors or snakes this time, but a real murderous evil villain, with dangerous followers, that needs to be stopped.I'm sort of fed up though with all of these new characters that constantly get introduced in every new Harry Potter movie. It's of course not that any of those characters are bad, or being portrayed by horrible actors, but it just goes at the expensive of already some fine and established actors, such as Minerva, Dumbledore, Snape and Hagrid, who are now all being pushed more to the background. The movie is now filled with literally dozens of characters, that are not all getting the attention they need and deserve.This is a very recommendable movie, especially if you thought that all of the Harry Potter movies were still too childish.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Action
It wasn't as good as it should have been.,"Once again we packed the theaters once again to watch our good friends Harry, Ron, and Hermione take on yet another year at Hogwarts. The overall performance and outcome of the movie was good, but not up to expectations...or at least mine.The acting was overall well played as Daniel Radcliffe again shows his skill. Emma Watson is growing up nicely, but she puts on a low scale performance and Rupirt in the middle. However, new comer Evanna Lynch shines in her light role as Luna Lovegood. Her ability to have that straight tone voice puts a good laugh in. Moving onto the movie, the movie to me seemed too slow, and only a few action sequences made me feel bored during parts. And EVEN with the intense action sequences seemed low key(not going to spoil). The movie, in my opinion, did not live up to the bar set by the Goblet and the Prisoner. The story line follows maybe about 90% of the book, but like before, it seemed slow. Emma, Daniel, and Rupirt still have that click about them and you can definitely tell there into the movie,maybe a bit too much? OK well off with the bad and to the good. Themovie IS good, don't get me wrong. The colorful cast puts on a show and makes you feel attached to everyone of them. And for bonus points, most if not all are still the same actors and actresses. The CGI images and transitions are steller and I was amazed. So... all in all I think this movie could of and should have been better. In my honest opinion I'd recommend Transformers before this. Transformers is a change of pace and I highly recommend the film. But it was good to see our three main stars in yet another evolution through puberty. Seven out of Ten",7.0,Anonymous,Action
one of the best Harry Potters yet!,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has a gripping main story involving the continuing peril for Harry and his arch nemesis, the dark lord Voldermort (Fiennes, as sinister as possible), but what surprised me a little was seeing that there's even a kind of political subtext to the story at Hogwarts. This is personified by the ministry's new professor-cum-control freak Umbridge (Oscar nominee Imelda Staunton), who teaches theory instead of practice, and is every ultra-harsh, practically laughable disciplinarian you've ever had the horror to have over your heads. Odd for some other ""kids"" movies (save for Happy Feet), but for the Harry Potter universe the foreboding presence of the ministry makes the feeling of the dread that Potter has to face that much more pronounced, as a feeling of helplessness spreads out amongst everyone in the society despite the message from the messenger that 'everything's fine'. Staunton is perfect in the role of Umbridge, and helps to make the character as part of the ranks of those played by Alan Rickman (?), Gary Oldman (not really), and Ralph Fiennes (for sure) as one of the most dastardly figures in the Potter universe. Though she may even be more chilling, even as a momentary figure, because of what she represents for those who need to practice magic first hand.The sense of rebellion with the Hogwarts school is a solid facet for the Order of the Phoenix storyline, and except for a tiny sub-plot involving Harry and Cho Chang, and some of the visuals involved when the kids finally take over during a big exam (kind of like a super-magical version of the Another Brick in the Wall music video), it's a great balance for the much darker elements at work. There's another facet, aside from strong performances (Radcliffe, by the way, is really coming into his own more than ever), which is that David Yates- primarily a director of British television- imbues a lot of extraordinary imagery here. Mostly, because, he makes what could be another 'kids' movie, as the first two films were, and makes a gradual progression from the third and fourth installments into the realm of a sort of pop-surrealism; the image of Voldermort at the train station moving his neck around could be out of a stark painting, same for the ""mystery"" room that serves for the climax of the film. It's much more sophisticated than one might expect, albeit some typical flashbacks used in the realm of the conceit that Voldermort screws around with Potter's mind a lot, and it's certainly the first time since 'Azkaban' that the direction and the script are at levels of quality that one might not expect in a big summer blockbuster. There's nuance in this struggle of good vs evil, and it's worth seeing it in the theater if only on that level.And as foreboding and cryptic and always with the ominous foreshadowing- unless you've read Half-Blood Prince (from which I've heard, as I haven't read any of the books, is even *darker* than any of the others combined, with even truly disturbing imagery)- as Phoenix can get, there's still a sense of it being a crowd-pleaser. I liked the scenes where Hagard shows Potter and the others his half-brother, a huge ogre that marks as the least essential character story-wise but is a lot of fun to watch, and the scenes with Potter and the others in their secret training rooms gives the movie a sense of purpose for the audience to follow along. In a strange way there is some hope in Order of the Phoenix, though one needs to find it, and not in the way that the one ""we don't mention"" would go about it.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Entertaining but fails the book,"I just went to watch the latest Harry Potter installment with my son. To start with the end (in more than one sense) my son was almost fuming at it. Having read the whole thing a few (several?) times he was very mindful of all the things that changed from the book, but the ending is what upset him the most and from then I started thinking on the whole ordeal. Saying that a movie wasn't faithful to a book is normally stating the obvious and in this case while the main events from the book are there a good part of the spirit of the book died at the hands of the script writer and the director. Don't get me wrong I don't think the movie was a disaster (like that pathetic attempt of a movie called Eragon) but all the teen angst that overflows the 5th book is almost completely absent; is like the anger of a 15 y/o had been shrunk to a 9 y/o's size, and to complete the coup the very last scene is so cheesy that seems copied from a 80's TV series. The book is dark and the movie barely tries, which is perhaps what upset my son so much more than the scissors that made the 2'18"" movie possible.Apart from that, the movie is technically well crafted and quite entertaining. Imelda Stauton does a great job as Dolores Umbridge forcing you to hate her from the very first time you see her on the movie. The combat at the ministry is visually well done although it doesn't fully show the hectic scene portrayed in the book. All in all it would seem that someone tried to make the movie PG (and failed BTW) and in the process the story loses some of its potency. Pity.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
really bad,"This film was pathetic totally compared to the rest! the plot was thin, the acting dull, the delivery poor and the style the director/producer has chosen created a waste of time watching this movie.The graphics poorly utilised and all together a waste of money making and waste of my time watching and the cinema ticket.I appreciate that this book was very long and could in no way be created like Lords of the Rings in parts, however it should have been given more thought and consideration. It just seems that now that its a global phenomenon anything will do and less work needs to be done. Thats the wrong mentality to have.The characters were kept within their shells and not allowed to show more of themselves. It would have been nice to see one of the characters stick out and play something thats not expected from them.Apparently there was suppose to be so much new jokes attempted yet whilst watching the movie in full cinema showing there was only one person laughing and he was doing that throughout... NO DOUBT ON HOW STUPID THIS FILM WAS.As students we are disruptive and do not take to any abuse yet in this film students were assaulted and they just took it... without any powers I would have sorted her out and if i had powers like them all i would expect her body to be in shreds.the most liveliest character to waken me up and given me a good laugh was Evanna Lynch ... Luna Lovegood she gets a 1 the film gets nothing and no one else gets anything. she was cracking as the deranged new student. everyone else i cannot stand and think should be hanged, well if you cant do that maroon them to somewhere like Antarctica were they wont be seen.no sympathy for anybody as no one earned it.bury this film and say don't exist cos i have been told by book readers that the film does not do the book justice in the least.",1.0,Anonymous,Action

Of course it could have been better, for it is very short, but I do think it has the essence of book 5, which is quite hard when you have to fit 800 pages into a 2 and a half hour movie. most of the complains are about the lack of details, but it may be these details weren't as necessary as we thought or whatever the reason is; these movies are movies and we have to enjoy them as such, for we would never be completely satisfied with it as an adaptation of the book.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" - A Dark and Intense Chapter in the Series","""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is the fifth installment in the Harry Potter film series, and it takes a darker turn than its predecessors. The film follows Harry as he returns to Hogwarts for his fifth year, where he must cope with the aftermath of Cedric Diggory's death and the return of Lord Voldemort. As the wizarding world becomes increasingly divided, Harry and his friends must band together to fight against the rise of evil.Director David Yates brings a darker and more intense tone to the series, capturing the emotional depth and complexity of the story. The performances of the cast are once again outstanding, with Daniel Radcliffe delivering a powerful performance as Harry, and Emma Watson and Rupert Grint shining in their supporting roles.The film's special effects are also impressive, with the magical battles and spells brought to life in a way that is both visually stunning and realistic. The pacing of the film is excellent, with each scene building on the tension and excitement of the previous one.Overall, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is a gripping and intense addition to the Harry Potter franchise. With its complex characters, political intrigue, and stunning visuals, it is a must-see for fans of the series. While it may not be suitable for younger audiences due to its darker themes and occasional violence, it is a great film for older fans who are looking for a more mature and nuanced story.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
"Very different from the other films, but fantastic!!","Firstly lets point out that I am a Harry Potter fan. I am a big fan of the books, and though the films will never be as good, they have done well at capturing JK Rowling's wondrous world on the screen.So far each film has improved upon the last, perhaps owing to the fact that the characters/actors grow older with each film, thus each installment becomes more adult. So it would be fair to say I had high expectations for this film, the 5th in the series.Director David Yates and screenplay writer Michael Goldenberg had their work cut out for them, with the Order of the Phoenix book structured in a way that could present difficulties when translating to screen.Phoenix takes place after Voldemort has returned, yet the wizarding world is in denial, labeling Harry Potter and Dumbledore as liars, rather than believing their claims that the Dark Lord is back. Yet Harry is faced with more serious problems when he develops a psychological link to Voldemort which channels the Dark Lord's emotions through him.Unlike its four predecessors Phoenix does not play out in the conventional 'Harry' format. The first four books' plots progress with purpose, obviously building up to its climax, and the character's motives are clear throughout. Pheonix, however, is not so. The book almost plods along with less action, but heavier emotional and psychological underpinnings.This could have created a dilemma when translating the story into an engaging film; suitable for the broad audience the Harry Potter series attracts.It is clear from the first scene that Pheonix is going to be a very different film to the other in the HP series, with the use of a steady cam, and jerky filming techniques common in war films (a filming style which has not been used in any of the previous films).Phoenix has a much darker feel then the other Harry films, the enjoyable and exaggerated teenage drama of The Goblet of Fire replaced with angst and aggression.This new dark tone is very suitable to the story, and though this 'heavier' feel might not impress those fans who have become comfortable with the fun and fluffy tones of the other films, it is a needed new approach to a film series that could have easily become mundane.The heavy psychological aspect to the story could have been a challenge to adapt for film. I found myself nervous as the movie started wondering how they could possibly make Harry and Voldermort's mental link understandable and convincing.The fact that Harry feels the same emotions as Voldemort due to this link could have been hard to communicate on screen, yet Goldenberg and Yates have not shied away from the challenge tackling it head on. The result is awesome.The scenes in which Professor Snape delves into Harry's mind are  in the words of Ron Weasley  wicked! The use of flashbacks to previous films (look how little and cute they all are!) and the rapid editing are extremely effective and really add an emotional feel, reminding viewers of their connection with the three lead characters, whom they have practically watched grow up.Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter has come a long way from the wide-eyed young boy in The Philosophers Stone. He convincingly portrays a young man that is tormented mentally, adding enough aggression to his character without becoming unlikable.Dumbledore, the character that stands out most in the books, yet seems to have been neglected in the films, has a stronger presence in this movie. Phoenix finally touches on the greatness of this character and strong bond he and Harry share. The climactic battle between him and Voldermort will have your chin on the floor.The Verdict: This film follows the book more closely than the others,and though this may come as a relief to die-hard book fans, it does result in a slower moving film. Those viewers who are only loosely interested in the series may not find it as enjoyable, with viewers needing an interest in the character's emotional journeys in order to fully appreciate the film.The new darker approach to Pheonix, means the film is not a 'kid friendly' as the others, however the subject matter does not allow for sugar coating.This film is the best of the lot; the new style and tone a very welcome change. Phoenix is the most well made of the series with fantastic and original ways of piecing the scenes together (watch how they utilize the Daily Prophet newspaper). The psychological and emotional aspect of the film makes it very interesting and engaging, and will have even the adults on the edge of their seats.All I can say is: bring on the next one!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
"Further down the spiral, the magic is now completely gone.","Episode 5 brings us more of the same. the movie tries to summarize the big book in which (too) many details and story lines are described. The summary is actually quite good but, as part 4, has the killing effect of too many things in 2 and what hours. Therefore the movie is very hasty, giving the actors hardly the chance to act properly. As a matter of fact, the most characters have very little acting time. That makes it hard to empathize with the main characters and leaves you no other choice than to sit back and try to enjoy the many special effects (which are not all that great). The 'children' are becoming too old for their roles. I think it will become a big problem in the next two movies. It is a children's story trying to become mature. Therefore it's way too childish. The simple fight between good and bad, the magic of the first three parts, it's disappeared.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
A dark turn in the wizarding world,"""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"" directed by David Yates, is the fifth installment in the beloved series. This film marks a significant shift in tone, with darker themes and a more mature narrative as Harry and his friends face increasing threats from Voldemort and his followers.The story follows Harry as he returns to Hogwarts under the cloud of skepticism about his encounter with Voldemort. The Ministry of Magic, led by the obstinate Dolores Umbridge, refuses to acknowledge the dark lord's return, creating a tense atmosphere at the school. Harry, along with Ron and Hermione, forms ""Dumbledore's Army"" to prepare for the looming battle.Daniel Radcliffe gives a strong performance, capturing Harry's growing frustration and sense of isolation. Imelda Staunton's portrayal of Umbridge is delightfully sinister, adding a new level of menace to the series. The supporting cast, including Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, continue to shine, contributing to the film's emotional depth.Visually, the movie is impressive, with well-crafted special effects and a darker aesthetic that reflects the story's seriousness. The climactic battle at the Ministry is a standout, showcasing impressive action and emotional stakes.""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is a compelling entry in the series, balancing character development with a growing sense of danger. It effectively sets the stage for the darker challenges to come, making it a must-watch for fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
The second-best movie in the series.,"After a summer of movies filled with second, third, and fourth sequels, the most anticipated follow-up is finally here, and it is a fifth installment. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is the story of Year Five at Hogwarts for lead characters Harry, Hermione, and Ron, although a large portion of the movie occurs outside the grounds of the teens' school. More than a children's book, this episode builds upon strong themes of fear and friendship to create a solid piece of cinema.(Note: I have read only the first five books.) ""Order of the Phoenix"" (""OOTP"") tracks the ongoing saga of the interactions between the dark Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter, who is aided by the titular order, a sort of wizard Joint Chiefs of Staff. Many in the wizarding community doubt Harry's story that Voldemort has returned, and the Ministry of Magic has it in for Dumbledore, all of which means that Harry feels more alone than ever, despite the presence of people and places he loves. As always with a movie adapted from popular literature, two questions must be answered. 1) Was it a good movie, and 2) Was it a good adaptation of the book? Pleasantly, the response to both questions is yes, though each affirmative requires unique qualification.Having read the book, judging the movie strictly on its own merits is very difficult, because gaps on screen are filled in subconsciously by knowledge of the book. But this movie seems to succeed apart from those pages. Relatively unknown director David Yates keeps the story Harry-centric, giving it a brisk pace and making the main arc easy to follow, although a few other truncated story lines and characters will be enjoyed more by those who know them fully. Expanded motifs of Harry's anger and loneliness are expressed clearly but not heavy-handedly, through both pictures and the words of multiple characters. As was the case with the previous two installments, viewing this movie without first reading the book may result in confusion or at least a lesser understanding of everything, but having seen the first four movies will be plenty to let one comprehend this episode to an enjoyable extent.The latter question is more complicated. Many people will complain about plot elements that vary from the book. Those objections are true but invalid. Maybe a beloved character was axed, tweaked, or minimized. Perhaps a treasured moment was omitted or included in a disappointingly disparate manner. Make no mistake about it; many things were altered. But when an 870-page tome is being condensed into a two hour and eighteen minute movie, cuts must be made. Much like time constraints demanded that ""The Lord of the Rings"" focus largely on Frodo at the expense of favorites like Tom Bombadil, this story must focus on Harry Potter. There are reasons that he is the title character. So no one gets to see Firenze teach or Ron and Hermione fight or anything about Quidditch or prefects. Looking objectively at the modifications though, the primary story arc does advance satisfactorily without those missing parts. Perhaps the galloping pace could have slowed to a canter, as the movie was indeed a rarity that could easily have been twenty minutes longer. But the purpose should then have been to expand upon the elements already in place rather than to add missing ones.The more important goal is that the movie be faithful to the spirit of the book, and on that level, ""OOTP"" hits its mark. ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" displayed the world of wizards better than any other Potter movie because of two key inclusions: the little ways magic was used in the background and the fantastic scene-setting shots. Yates nearly recaptures Alfonso Cuaron's brilliance, approaching it with elements like kittens wandering around in pictures and spectacular zooms over Hogwarts. Of equal importance, he also executes small moments even better than the source material, wonderfully depicting simple enjoyments like laughter and friendship are a stark contrast to the lurking complex evil of You Know Who. These small interactions imbue the movie with a soul that adds substance and humanity to an adventurous and magical universe.""OOTP"" suffers slightly from middle-film-in-a-series syndrome, but in a good way. Much like ""The Two Towers"" or ""The Matrix Reloaded"", one gets the feeling that it picks up and ends mid-story, with only a necessary modicum of resolution, as though setting the stage for something grand. That promise of something huge just ahead actually enhances the power of the movie. It leaves one desperately awaiting the next chapter more so than any other Potter movie. ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"", the next in the series, screams to be (re-)read before the seventh and final book is released next Saturday.Ultimately, viewers who have not read the book should be able to follow along easily, and the movie should quench the appetites of fans with reasonable expectations. The gist of the book is explored in numerous ways, resulting in an experience that will leave one with a few thrills and chills, and a smile on one's face.Bottom Line: A concise return to the spirit of the book, capturing the world with a proper dose of cinematic license. 7 of 10 for the second best movie in the series.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
Different to book....but still bloody good,"Exceeds expectations....however, I must say that I felt the makers of the film left out some of the best scenes (such as the St.Mungos//Lockhart/Nevilles Parents scene). The score (as in the music)was not as uplifting/scary/whatever it needed to be to fit in as it had previously been in the other films. However, compared to the other films, the settings, costumes and makeup have improved vastly.Daniel Radcliffe carried off an angsty, arrogant teenage boy to perfection, perhaps due to an increased growth in his acting skills (not to mention his new, admirable body that he probably spent many hours working). Rupert Grint was likable in this film as well, however, I believe he had not as much lines or camera time as his acting skills deserve. Emma Watson, on the other hand, seemed somewhat out of place at the beginning of the film, her acting not comparable to that of the other films. However, by the end (the most exciting/interesting part of the film) her acting had somewhat improved, and she no longer irritated me.Newcomers Imelda Staunton (Umbridge) and Evanna Lynch (Luna) shocked me. Not only were they better then I imagined, but they actually were better then the rest of the original cast. And Helena Bonham Carters (Beatrix Lestrange)'s entrance sent a shiver down my spine.Althogether, this is the best of the 5! Can't wait till the next one!",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Amazing,"A new direction for the potter franchise with newcomer to the series David Yates. I wonder why he wasn't involved in all of them, as the previous four films have lacked solidity, direction, pacing, atmosphere and have just been generally disappointing and fairly poor in quality. Yates brings a much needed crunch to the series, with frenetic camera work, tight editing, special effects sequences that finally reflect the magic of the world being portrayed by the books and.....fantastic performances. Yes, I may have criticised Radcliffe in the past but his performance has finally broken out of the dulcet tones of the previous films. His performance matches the new pitch of intensity resonated by this outstanding film.As the film begins, the grey clouds surround the WB sign, drifting forward and out of sight to reveal the Harry Potter logo set to what can only be described as a jaded rendition of the theme tune, which sets the tone immediately. Then the camera drops from the sky to a playground where Harry faces Dudley and his friends. What is instantly noticeable is that the camera work is much more well considered, effective and artistic than previous directors botched attempts at the franchise. What entails is an eerie contemplative build up that plunges right into a heart pounding chase. But its not that the cinematography is just good for the Potter films, it is fantastic beyond this and is some of the best work i have seen in recent films.This is an overall much darker set of affairs than before, more serious, reflecting a desperate time for the wizarding world. Harry begins to become isolated in his mind's eye. He gets angry, he questions himself and others a great deal more. But this is also the time when he breaks from the mould and takes things into his own hands. A new addition to the fray is Luna Lovegood, providing an outlet for Harry's isolation. Drifting and flaky she adds a greater depth to the film. Umbridge is fleshed out superbly, a wicked callous performance laced with a buoyant sense of self indignation. Its good to see that Gary Oldman was in fact used on set this time, and delivers a fantastic and emotional performance. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint also deliver great performances, but I always felt they were never as problematic as Radcliffe. And, as per usual The rest of the supporting adults slink in nicely from Rickman's world weary, cynical and snarling turn to Gambon's dutiful and wise performance.The success of this film is that it ..feels like Harry Potter, this is how it Should be. It never at any point feels rushed as the others have, instead taking time to reflect on itself with serene moments of ambiance that bring a wonderful sense of calm to the darkening world around the characters. The sets are also fantastic, the Ministry of Magic reflecting a sense post communist fascist nihilism, with the Stalin-esquire portrayal of Fudge looming over the cold black walls. Which ultimately sets up the genuinely creepy panic stricken dash through the Hall of Prophecies and the blisteringly exciting set of wand duels that bring the film to a close. Another new set is Sirius' house which is brilliantly shabby, tucked away between two muggle houses. It is both inviting and chilling, especially effective are the room with the family tree and the bitter house elf kreature who's ramblings are a refreshing change from the way the cgi creations have been presented before.Although worth mentioning is the shift in music as well, as it now is not just chirpy renditions of the theme tune, but fantastically suited to the events and help to shape a mood and bring much needed emotional impact.Overall Potter mad or not, this is and absolutely amazing film, subtle in places, brash in others, never is boring, always boiling with an underlying intensity, with a wash of ambiance and reflection. It is perhaps ironic that possibly one of the weaker books turns out to be the best film. I cannot recommend it any more : ) , but thanks for finally getting it right.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
I loved it,"A Harry Potter movie for the first time in the franchise's history seems almost overshadowed by the fact that the final book in this extremely successful series is due just over a week after the cinematic release of one of the book adaptations. However this brings nothing away from the fact that this movie will be extremely successful.Before i got to see this movie Prisoner of Azkaban was by far my favourite of the adaptations with Goblet of fire close behind (mostly for it's action as i felt that it is almost disappointing after re-watching compared to its magnificent book) First and foremost i must say that i thought David Yates' version of Order of the Phoenix was as near to perfect as i could hope from the shortest movie in the series ( although it was the longest book). Daniel Radcliffe has for the first time in my opinion portrayed Harry perfectly compared to some of the weak acting we have grown accustomed to from his previous outings in the franchise. Obviously Radcliffe has matured more as an actor having a lot more confidence in his role and funnily enough this has been the hardest challenge for his character yet in terms of acting having to bring across realistic sympathy for this character who is going through all the angst and confusion of someone slowly being possessed by Voldemort. I say this because for the first time i don't think i cringed once at one thing he said in this potter movie. We may put this simply down to the fact that he bravely got his wand out on stage in ""Equus"" and that this gave him some confidence but i really think that Radcliffe is beginning to blossom into a good actor(perhaps a little late in the franchise but time will tell.) Now to the story, as i said the shortest movie running at 2hrs and 18mins even though it is based on a 736 page book. Of course things were going to be left out and they are, but unless we wanted a 15hr long movie there is bound to be things left out. I think where Newell failed in GOF, Yates thrived in OOTP, Yates has perfectly captured the feeling in this story showing us how alone Harry feels and the beautiful relationship he has with Sirius his godfather. This was very important for the ending of the story which i do not want to ruin for people who are not fans of the book.So Yates brings us the story perfectly setting up relationships that we know are going to be significant in the next movie by leaving nice little subtle hints here and there. Also by using a mainly TV experienced director we have the potter series in a totally different way with completely different techniques. Never before have we had flashbacks from the other movies ( which i thought was a success) or slow motion sequences which do not come across as tacky but slotted in perfectly to catch the audiences attention or to arouse emotion also the use of the shaking camera which would usually be more of a TV thing is perfectly used in the start which makes the audience feel much more engaged in it.The acting, well what can i say i don't think that there was one piece of extremely weak acting this time around as all the teenagers are growing into young adults and becoming much more asserted in their roles. As for new castings, Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge the High inquisitor at hogwarts was amazing. I don't think i have seen someone that deliciously evil on screen for sometime giving us a shocking performance that if an actor from a harry potter film was ever to get an Oscar nomination this would be it. A great performance in which even the slightest giggle or "" so silly of me"" can come across as evil.Evanna lynch as Luna Lovegood, an Irish girl who is a major fan of the books and probably the best bit of casting in this franchise and that is not an over-statement, her dreamy voice and manner bring across the eccentricity of the bewildering character that we can't help but fall in love with.All the cast deserve honourable mentions, Michael Gambon,Emma Watson, Rupert Grint,Gary Oldman and Helena Bonham Carter all playing their parts brilliantly.All in all, this movie is a brilliantly crafted tense thriller throughout relying on the eerie atmosphere throughout the second act to catch the audiences attention, we can feel a great sense of growing danger but not one that we can fully put our finger on. Also, This movie is probably, the most touching,moving,and funny of the series so far with great thought put into character development and relationships between the characters.Harry is growing up having his first kiss in this movie which i thought was a well done scene but surpassed by the one that followed in which Harry is asked by Ron and Hermione "" How was it?"" ""Wet"" He Replies.Also with Michael Gambon back on form as Dumbledore the scene in which he escapes arrest is perfectly done with a great sign off from Shacklebolt, "" I know you may not like him minister, but you gotta admit Dumbledore's got style"" This movie sets us up for what is to come since POA we have known that harry ain't no little kid with silly magic tricks and the darkness in the the 5th movie of the potter franchise perfectly conveys this with the amazing third act at the ministry that will leave you literally begging for more.I give this a slightly biased 10/10 which some people may think is a lot.. but i loved it and i highly recommend it to everyone but i think it will be much more in the taste of the book's fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
"Not bad, but not good, and too short","This movie, put simply, was made for anyone that has NOT read the books. The plot was really just small snippets of major plot points, with their only purpose, to lead us into the intense final battle scenes. The fight scenes were part of the movie that were done quite well.The movie lacked any kind of somewhat complex structure. It dismissed many scenes which i think made the books what they are. The movie showed no smaller details and missed out many scenes, for example, the Harry/Ginny growing relationship, Harry/Chos relationship(besides from a kiss), the fountain fight, nothing is mentioned about prefects, quidditch, N.E.W.T.S, Harry's aspiration to become an auror, Hagrids fight against thugs, valentine, Fred and Georges joke shop and Sirius's 2-way mirror. Nor was Harrys anger scene in Dumbledores office included, which gave reason for the whole book, it was instead cut down to a very brief scene in which nothing was revealed about Sirius's death.Overall, the movie was probably a let down for 'Harry Potter' fans or anyone who had read the book. However, it had its moments and the fight scenes and large sets were quite amazing. Another positive was the casting, with all cast members acting well. However these positives do NOT make up for the plot holes. It definitely had an issue with length and was way too short. For these final books they should be around the 200+ minute mark. I would happily even sit through a 5 hour movie. Anything to see the book transformed into the movie successfully.It was barely worth seeing, and frustrating.",1.0,Anonymous,Action
It was okay,I go see Harry Potter every year that it comes out and this year was no different.I actually got to go to the sneak peek. I really enjoyed this one but at the same time I don't think it was one of the best. I know reading the books and watching the movie are two different things but this time it was way off course. Lots of the details and scenes that were described in the book didn't show up in the movie at all. It wasn't a major loss but I don't think I would recommend people trampling over each other to get inside the theater. =/ I really would like to see what the critics have to say about the film this year and I want to hear from other people who saw the movie as well.,8.0,Anonymous,Action
Not too bad,"A lot is jammed into the Order of the Phoenix. The first few films in the Harry Potter franchise were steady with their pacing. Order of the Phoenix escalates the pace and has a flurry of events that it can almost be hard to follow what is going on.Overall it is not a bad film. We see Professor Umbridge make life difficult for Harry, Dumbledore and his allies. The film and franchise does well by forging the sole path Harry has to follow, his destiny is unique. He takes the lead by forming a willing coalition of his own to take on Voldemort and his evil allies. The strong point of the film was the final sequence and show down with Voldemort and some sad scenes as well that would leave fans heartbroken, perhaps even the ones who read the books. We are introduced to the Order of the Phoenix at the very start of the film but this barely features for the remainder of the film. I am not doubting its significance but it falls into the background while the story goes on. Perhaps more emphasis could have been put on it to weave the story together. Overall not too bad a film.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, isn't that bad. After leaving the previous 22 ( or 4, i can't remember) Harry Potter films with tears in my eyes and a numb arse, I was happy to see that they are getting better as the characters grow up. The films are getting Darker with more action and story lines are starting to take shape. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson are starting to act now and this for one make watching the film a whole lot easier.

Way Better than the Book!!!,"I watched this IMAX version this morning and it was well worth the expense. This is one of those rare times where the movie is WAY BETTER than the book! The Order of the Phoenix is my least favorite of the six published books so far. The adventures were repetitive of previous books. I felt that nothing original was introduced. I also felt that it was not well-written since the action is not clearly described. When I finished the book, I did not feel any sense of awe that I felt especially with the fantastic 4th (Goblet of Fire) and 6th (Half Blood Prince) books! But this film was the total opposite. After sitting through disappointing film interpretations of the 3rd (Prisoner of Azkaban) and 4th books, this movie is a vast improvement over the book. I guess I have to credit the writer for distilling the ponderous text into this coherent and action-packed adventure script. And the director, David Yates, who is relative newcomer, who created an amazing vision from the lackluster printed words. The story is easy to follow, and logically sequenced. The action scenes are very well choreographed and executed on the big screen.The IMAX version features 3D rendition of the last 20 minutes of this 2 hour 20 minute film. This was from the scene where the gang flies off to London to fight Voldemort on flying beasts, through their dangerous magical adventures in the Ministry of Magic. The 3D effects of the flying around, the perspectives of the doorways and corridors within the building, the destruction made by the violent spells being thrown around were nothing short of amazing and impressive.The three main kids have really grown up. Daniel Radcliffe really turned out to be the perfect actor for Harry. He grew up well with the series, and can indeed carry off the heroics and angst of the title character. Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron)have less screen time here, but they also did their job well. The chose well for the actress (Evanna Lynch) to play Luna Lovegood, who is quite annoying in the book, but very well portrayed in this movie. Those small clues regarding Ginny Weasley were also excellently hinted in many scenes, and very well underplayed by Bonnie Wright.The esteemed senior members of the class do their best with their limited screen time, such as Gary Oldman, Robbie Coltrane, Emma Thompson (so good as Sibyl Trelawney!) and Maggie Smith. I still miss Richard Harris as Dumbledore. There is something amiss in Michael Gambon's performance in my opinion.Their nemesis in this installment is Dolores Umbridge played so sinisterly by Imelda Staunton. I have only heard of this actress from ""Vera Drake."" She is so good at being so hateful! She interpreted this villain as I imagined as she was described in the book. With a shorter villain role is Helena Bonham Carter as the mad Deatheater, Bellatrix Lestrange.Overall, an excellent film!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Hits and Misses in acting,"As far as plot goes, it matches exactly that in the book, though only the essential plot is portrayed. Most of the details which made the book so popular has been edited away, which is understandable. One of the reasons why I saw this movie was to see how they manage to cut the book down to a 2 hour movie. But, fraid not, the plot still manages to keep you in your seat throughout the movie.That said, one of the best way to measure this movie is in terms of acting. For those who read the book, all the characters are very colourful and diverse. Unfortunately not so in the movie. Albus Dumbledore for one is entirely flat throughout the movie. Michael Gambon never did manage to portray him as magnificent as the lead character should be. Each time his scene comes on, I was praying that it wont last long.The other 3 main characters, the young students, was really just so-so. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe)'s acting has not much substance, though I must say it was better than the previous movies. Rupert Grint wasn't that much better too. And Emma Watson didn't have enough screen time to show off her potential.There are however, excellent characters in this movie. Such as Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) and Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch). Their acting matches the character and maybe even surpasses the book, at least in my opinion. Emma Thompson as Sybil deserves an applaud too. And yet another character that stands out is Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix Lestrange. Though she comes in late in the movie, and has very little on screen time, her acting alone more than makes up for the loss of all the other main characters. Here's one character to look forward to in the next movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Action

Harry Potter,"Harry Potter series is quite popular for teenagers and adults too. It became live-action which is great. The first movie, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's stone, is not very good as the fantasy is quite mild but as the series go on, from a PG rating to a PG-13 rating, it is getting more darker. This movie is the newest Harry Potter movie, passing on to the fifth year for Harry Potter in Hogwarts and Voldemort is back, finally gets to show magic powers. There too are new characters as for Dolores Umbridge, Bellatrix Lestrange, a new villain and Lunna Lovegood. With all these new characters, Harry Potter will have face more difficulties. Harry Potter movies are just the short version of the long-pages books. For me, I prefer to watch than reading long stories.The movies are getting better, with more darker tone and more serious looks, this movie can never go wrong with teenagers and adults if they like dark movies. This will definitely have darker tone compared to the other Harry Potter movies. Then soon, as the series move on, it will be quite dark with different directors with different ideas. I will have to see how this go on.It is not that bad, it is just a bit too short. There is not much action to it. Oh yeah, I forgot, Harry Potter is mainly a theme for frightening scenes not some big action. Well then, you can't expect some exploding things, if you want that, go and watch Transformers. Harry Potter proves to be more darker. Now, he loses his cool and shouts back, now he wants revenge. Harry Potter is growing up. It is not the timid boy you once knew. The last fight is disappointing. Once again, you are dealing with magic not big action.You will probably get some shock if you watch it in cinema and also there is some suspense. So if your kids are afraid, don't bring them. You should know Harry Potter movies are increasingly dark.",6.0,Anonymous,Action

"good movie, bad portrayal","I greatly enjoyed the third and fourth films, i believe both Alfonso Cuarón and Mike Newell did a great job in portraying the characters both sympathetically and dramatically. however, i was very much disappointed with the fifth instalment. being a major Harry Potter fan I had waited on baited breath for it's release and was not met with the same magical feeling I had during the other movies or indeed the books. though the fifth book was not one of my favourites to begin with, with it being rather long and slow going at the beginning, the pace was also that of slow in the movie, though the acting was better than the other films, there didn't appear to be much of it. Cuarón had directed a film about the fulfilment of responsibility, about the trivialities of being a teenager and having to make important choices, Newell had taken a further step into the teenage world, creating love confusions between some of the characters that were perhaps not so obvious in the books, yet, Yates seems to have divulged his time into concentrating on different and very interesting camera shots and angles which work effectively but allow for a detachment to be made with the viewer. as a viewer i had little feelings towards any of the characters and noticed a lot of the time the use in time manipulation (flash backs etc) and the difference in both special effects and story line compared to previous films and the book itself. many things were inconsistent with the storyline which on many an occasion was very distracting and further hindered my enjoyment of the film. on the whole though worth watching, a true fan of the books and films may find this film a little far from its true potential.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
Got the book nailed in one,"Took me several readings of the book 'OotP' to like it as much as the others, but the film is excellent: unnecessary detail is left out, and the story fits the time of a film beautifully. the new director has understood that the Harry Potter fans have grown up too, therefore the dark side can and does come out more. Characters more believable too. Apparently it took 2 years to write the screenplay - two years well spent. The final fight scene and different flying scenes gives us a welcome break from Quidditch. Brilliant casting of Dolores and Luna and Bella Lestrange - and excellent Grawp. Don't listen to / read from other people, go and see the film for yourself.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
A Disappointment.,"I found the fifth movie to be a rather disappointment to watch. The screenplay, as highly predicted, well that is, from myself (due to the change in the screenwriter) is VERY inconsistent with the other movies. The new style of story-telling Harry Potter's journeys are very different. This particular film did not display the magic as I anticipated. I was actually quite bored in the theater for many parts of the film. There were too many silent moments and way too much dialog.The soundtrack was another thing. The same tracks were playing over and over again.I am a die-hard Harry Potter Fan of BOTH the books and the films. I just can't wait to see the return of the screenwriter and music composer for the sixth movie. Thank Heavens!!!!!!TOO much of UNIMPORTANT stuff was taken out of the book-too many unimportant scenes, irrelevant to the main plot were shown (i.e, Sirius's Family Tree). Hermoine and Ron being prefects are VERY important to the main plot as it further shows how Harry is avoided by Dumbledore, AS WELL as the very important scene of Harry seeing Snape's memory!!! TOO SHORT!This movie was more of actually bringing a few scenes of the book come to life as to making it an actual movie.(though I may say that the last 20 minutes, were quite impressive...IMAX 3-D. wow. but still...)",6.0,Anonymous,Action
"Excellent, Best one YET!","David Yates, director, has done one of the best jobs on a Harry Potter movie yet. Alfonzo Curron, director of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban did the best job in my eyes until Order of the Pheonix. They cut out much that was in the book but they made up for all that by adding new clips that made the movie even better. Yates will be directing the Half- Blood Prince, the 6th book in the amazing series by J. K. Rowling and i am really looking forward to it. ANYONE WHO LIKES HARRY POTTER MUST SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! The movie goes by quick but it will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole film. It is packed with action, intensity and surprises. Even though they cut out much from the book, i enjoyed it, unlike my brother who disagrees and finds the movie terrible just because they cut too much out, they still leave the main parts of the book in the movie. Who ever seen this movie will agree with me that Helena Bonham Carter plays Bellatrix Lastrange perfectly and without any problem. MUST SEE MOVIE OF THE SUMMER!",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Needed to be at least 15 minutes longer,"This installment of Harry Potter is the first one in which the filmmakers trimmed away virtually every subplot that was present in the huge book upon which it is based; only the main plot is served. A good idea I think. But, even though they cut the plot(s) to the bone, the second half of the film still feels rushed. It is about at the halfway point that the clear, focused editing of the movie turns choppy, with one sequence following another with little or no transition; I kept expecting the characters to get cut off in mid-sentence, but that never actually happened.Also, this HP, though generally very high in quality, suffers from the same lack of clarity that has afflicted each of the films in the series since the unjustly maligned first two installments. The director of the first two, Chris Columbus, was bashed by some for creating a simplistic, Disney-ish version of the Potter stories. There may be a little truth to that, but there's also something that no one credits him for--clarity. There is not a single moment in either of the first two films where anyone in the audience could have been heard asking another one ""What just happened?"" The films since the first two have upped the sophistication level and pace considerably, but have in the process lost this clarity. For example in this most recent film I could hear people all around me asking each other questions about what they'd just seen, especially during the rushed second half. The editors don't seem to realize what story points need to be emphasized and made clear. For instance, kissing scene or no, the budding and then decaying relationship between Harry and Cho is played in such muted tones that many in the audience not familiar with the book were left wondering what was going on when things started to go bad. And Luna Lovejoy's last lines were so subtlety presented that my wife whispered to me ""That went right past mewhat is she talking about?"" The editors and screenwriters of the Potter films, tasked with condensing the increasingly gigantic novels into 2 hour films are falling into the trap of mistaking the mere dispensing of information with the telling of a story. Storytelling is about rhythm and flow, high points and quiet timesit's not about just lining all the bits and pieces up in neat, even rows.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
For once I wasn't disappointed - not even a little bit! awesomo!,"Well I went into this movie without many expectations and without rereading the book (it was my least fave) but having said that, this film i enjoyed so much and didn't come out thinking 'omg what was that?' What really made this good was the fact that everyone acted really well for once. Nothing felt too contrived. There were a lot of moments skirted over (i'm glad they cut all that stuff about cleaning out the house) but they kept all the key checkpoints. And for once, one could emote with Harry. His performance was top here and I could really feel his anguish and despair. Well done Radcliffe. What was also a plus was Luna - really well cast as was Umbridge (i was skeptical at first cos at first glance you just want to hug Imelda Staunton).The SFX was great too and the climax at the Ministry was given full justice (unlike last film's).The use of hand-held shots was refreshing too. And nice moments caught by the director esp with Ginny. (v.subtle but there nonetheless).Definitely the best Potter movie since the debacle of no.3 and 4. If you treat it as a separate entity to the book.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
A disappointment...,"I was extremely depressed by the way this movie turned out. I, being one who read and appreciated the story in the book, was forced to compare it constantly to the movie. The movie lacked significant parts of the book, parts that do end up in later texts, such as Siruis' two-way mirror, Ron and Hermione being prefects, and Neville being able to see Thestrals and hear the voices from the arch, while Ron and Hermione can not, which they made viewers believe that Neville could not..I cannot view this movie as a good movie, without a book, because it randomly inserted parts of the book, such as the title of the D.A. which is first mentioned by Dumbledore when he was under question by the Ministry, expecting the viewers to have read the book.The young witches and wizards are also seen using spells without verbally announcing the spells, an ability that they learn in a later book. Also, the D.A. uses the spell Levicorpus, a spell introduced in HBP, and important to the discovery of the identity of the Half Blood Prince. A minor complaint that happened to urk me, as does the lack of the words SNEAK in pimples across the betrayers nose(from the book.) My biggest problem with the movie? The lack of integration of the parts. All of the Occlumency lessons occurred around the same time, the D.A. meetings were in a short time frame, and the decrees were all announced in about 15 minutes. The film had important moments in short bursts, not a slow, well-timed introductions that would keep the audience interested in those particular parts of the movie, while simultaneously showing them a new situation.The film bounced around to various scenes, without connective tissue. One minute the plot is focusing on Umbridge, then suddenly we see students in Hogsmede.I will applaud the use of music, which was well-written and well-timed. I loved the visual effects, the movie was seen with Digital quality, the first movie in the theater to be so.I am disappointed by the screenwriters lack of adaptive ability and the serious neglect of the director and producers to get the best story from a screenplay. What happened to the awesomeness that was the first movie (which only needed Hermione's trial in the Third floor corridor) and the second movie (the one that, in my opinion, what the most true to the original story)? Why did this franchise alienate the fans of the book?",1.0,Anonymous,Action
Harry's growing up!,"I had high hopes for this movie, because I've seen all the others and thought they were great. I've heard a lot of people saying that this movie does not cut when compared to the others. However, I think that this movie tops them all. Harry Potter, Hermione, Ron and all the others are growing up and therefore the stories have to change accordingly. However, I had hoped to see some sort of development between Ron and Hermione :) but I guess it will be there in the next ""story."" ""The tales of Harry Potter and his friends"" have turned into great movies and to my mind they can be enjoyed by people of all ages. Have fun watching it.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
A More Mature Chapter in the Wizarding World,"Growing up can be tough, even for wizards. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" casts a darker spell than its predecessors. Gone is the wide-eyed joy of discovery; Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) now carries the weight of a world on his shoulders. The Ministry refuses to acknowledge Voldemort's return, clinging to outdated ideas. At Hogwarts, the cruel Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton) cracks down on magic and anything that smacks of individuality. Harry, with his ever-loyal friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint) by his side, forms a secret resistance to fight back. These aren't the playful pranks of their youth; this is a fight for freedom with real consequences.The series thrives on hidden connections and surprising reveals, but for longtime fans, some of the magic fades. The plot twists are a bit easier to predict this time around. However, Harry's journey takes a big step forward. He ventures beyond Hogwarts, soaring over London with his friends. This raises interesting questions. How do the magical and Muggle worlds truly interact? Can Harry become a leader on a global scale? Will spells be relevant in the face of real-world problems? J. K. Rowling leaves these mysteries dangling, promising answers in the final book.Despite the darker tone, ""Order of the Phoenix"" is a well-crafted film. British productions are known for their quality, and this movie maintains that high standard. The special effects seamlessly blend with the real world, making the magic feel real. The cast is a treasure trove of British acting talent, with Staunton a chillingly perfect villain. Helena Bonham Carter cuts a striking figure as a combination of all three witches from Macbeth. Familiar faces like Robbie Coltrane, Ralph Fiennes (as the ever-looming Voldemort), Michael Gambon, and many more round out the impressive ensemble.""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is a strong entry in the series, but it's a different kind of magic. The lighthearted wonder of the early films gives way to a more mature story with darker themes. While some of the whimsical charm is missing, the film is still enjoyable and sets the stage for even greater challenges to come. On a scale of spells, I'd give it a 7.9625 out of 10. It's a good movie, but fans expecting the carefree adventures of the first few films might be surprised by the shift in tone.7.96/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
Good technical aspects!,"The technical aspects are a step down as well in comparison to the previous two chapters, at least. It looks remarkably average in every department, except the performances which I will talk about next. And even the score by Nicholas Hooper doesn't manage to evoke any sort of feeling. Still there are few moments that's well captured & captivating but for the majority of its runtime, Order of the Phoenix remains very stale & adds nothing special to the franchise.As for the performances, the recurring cast has put their strong foot forward while the new additions are simply amazing. From the recurring cast, Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort), Michael Gambon (Albus Dumbledore), Alan Rickman (Severus Snape) & Gary Oldman (Sirius Black) are the standouts. Amongst the new cast, Evanna Lynch is bloody perfect as Luna Lovegood & so is Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. And Imelda Staunton as Dolores Umbridge manages to make viewers hate her quite effortlessly.On an overall scale, Harry Potter & the Order of the Phoenix has moments of highs & lows and manages to entertain in bits n pieces but it still feels highly inferior when compared to how much the last two sequels contributed to the saga. It was headed for a disaster but manages to correct itself by some extent during its third act.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
The evil did not return.,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. The evil did not return. The film ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is an exciting adventure full of magic, intrigue and emotion. In the fifth installment of the series, Harry faces various obstacles, from a difficult relationship with the Ministry of Magic, battling his inner demons and building a resistance against Lord Voldemort. Despite disappointments and betrayals, Harry finds support in his friends and proves his will to win. Director David Yates brings the world of JK Rowling's book to life in a visually stunning way, using dazzling special effects and a rich palette. The performances from the actors, especially Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, are striking in their maturity and emotional depth. The film also raises important questions about friendship, loyalty and fighting for what you believe in. It makes you think about the meaning of honor and self-sacrifice. ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" is not just a film about magic, but also about growing up, being and honor. It is a lively, powerful and inspiring masterpiece that manages to captivate and captivate both new and old fans of the Harry Potter universe.",10.0,Anonymous,Action
Don't believe the fan hype,"This movie is a solid 7 out of ten. The acting was good. The plot was extremely choppy and hard to follow. The visuals were mostly great, but there were a couple of terrible CGI creations. There is some character development and decent amounts of action, but this isn't an ""edge of your seat"" experience. I am a fan of the Harry Potter books. I think they're well told and a lot of fun. That said, most fans I know who have seen this movie were like ""It's the best movie of the century"" or ""I hate that they didn't include ___________, it ruined the entire movie."" They are both wrong. The fanboys and fangirls are eschewing it or lapping it up based on their feelings love of the books. This is a decent summer movie. I'm glad I didn't que up to see it on some midnight show, because it isn't worth a ton of money or a large time investment. It is a pleasant diversion if you have a block of free time and feel like going to the movies. That said, if you haven't seen Ratatouille or Transformers, I'd recommend those first as they have better visuals, better acting and a much more realized plot than this. Just my opinion, but that's about how I see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
David Yates directs the series to a darker atmosphere,"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007) is the first of the last four Harry Potter films to be directed by David Yates. This works well in my opinion, as the atmosphere across the last four films felt highly homogeneous.Number five in the series in one of the darkest, but it works well for the premise of the film adaptations. The simultaneous strength and humility of Harry is brilliantly portrayed by Yates in this.As usual with these films, the technical merits are top notch, with wonderful supporting cast of Gambon, Rickman and Smith, and of course wonderful visuals and music.

Best Potter film to date,"It's dark, it's the most faithful to date, and it has the best plot as of yet. The starting minutes are a bit on the bad side, suffering from the same thing the ending the last of the Potter flick suffered, which is it felt a bit rushed. Nevertheless, these minutes are brief, and as soon as Harry arrives at the headquarters of the Order of the Phoenix, things start to get good. New characters such as Loona Lovegood or Dolores Umbridge are expertly represented, and old characters (mainly Harry and Hermione) have never been represented better. The movie doesn't take everything from the book though, and it shows, however, it usually doesn't take very important parts. The ending is something to admire, because it is one of the parts were it is actually better than the book.I've never really loved the Harry Potter movies until now(fan of the books though), but this film is how it should be done from here on out.

"Fans of the books will be upset at the 300 pages cut out, while making a good stand-alone film for others","I've been reading Harry Potter books for a long time, and this was one I was looking forward to seeing. I expected things to be cut, seeing as the longest book would have to have parts omitted to make a decent-sized movie. Though knowing how people are, they would pay to see a three hour film...such as ""Lord of the Rings"" takes all day it seems. So why not add things? More like keep things in. Personally my favorite out of all of them is the fourth one, but I was still some-what impressed with the quality and how it still remained a fairly good film despite half of the book being cut out. If you've read the book, be prepared to be at least somewhat disappointed with the cuts. But otherwise, you will be entertained and who ever comes with you will like it too.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
better than the last,"While it will never be possible for any of the later films to be as true to the books as the first two (dont forget that the first two were less than 300 pages and the last several have been well over 600) I think that this movie does a good job of keeping to the story line. When a book is as beloved, and yes even as obsessed over, as these books are, there are always going to be those people that are disappointed when the minute details that make the story books what they are are not included in the movie. Overall, it is really well done and they managed to get much more of the main story line into this film than the last. The cinematography is wonderful and the acting is getting better every time. As the main characters grown up and their acting becomes less forced, the movies continue to evoke the essence of the written characters. The ensemble cast including such British greats as Maggie Smith, Helena Bonham Carter, Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson really brings these films past the children's films that I think that many adults think of them as and into an entirely new genre. Our grandparents had the Lord of the Rings and this generation has Harry Potter. Well worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,Action
Too rushed.... good fun but not memorable.... does not live up to the book,"The movie seemed rushed... too many details left out..... not too many important ones but still.... as someone who has read the book, I felt a little cheated as it seemed like too apparent an attempt to just make money riding on the Pottermania. A lot is left to assumption in the movie. THE CHARACTERS WERE TOO UNDER-DEVELOPED. Hell, Hermione and Ron looked like side-kicks.Also, the movie lacked drama at the critical moments. In the book, the last scene is supposed to be colossal. Dumbledore and Voldemort fighting should have been the showpiece of the movie. Also, a line in the book says..... HARRY REALISED WHY DUMBLEDORE WAS THE ONE WHO HE EVER FEARED...... Michael Gambon looked freaking scared in the whole sequence. There was just no rage in the eyes, no authority. A real pity as the scene could have been so much more but just fell flat for me. All in all, an average movie. 6 out of ten, no more. Make a long movie, dammit. Look at the LOTR trilogy. The vision was so grand and well-executed there that length was never an issue. All movies ran in excess of three hours but were BRILLIANT. If they wanna save the franchise in cinemas, they need to get a bigger-ticket director with an eye for fantasy, otherwise the books would be hugely let down by the movies.There are some movies that u enjoy while u see them and then there are some that u enjoy after u leave the theater.

Playtime is forever finished at Hogwarts!,"If you consider the Harry Potter franchise a coming-of-age film series, which I'm sure J. K. Rowling imagined it to be next to being a fantasy and adventure series, then ""Order of the Phoenix"" represents the dawn of a new era for young wizard Harry and his friends. Out with the innocence and playfulness, in with responsibilities and the everlasting battle for the right of your existence in this cruel and harsh world. The childhood era of ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" and ""Chamber of Secrets"", during which fooling around and making mistakes was allowed - and even encouraged - is long gone. The puberty phase of ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""The Goblet of Fire"", when it was still okay to discover oneself and revolt against the rules without too many consequences, is forever over and done with as well. Harry and C° enter adolescence in ""The Order of the Phoenix"", and with it comes the confrontation with injustice, the frustration of bureaucracy, and the foundation of life-long relationships; - whether friendships or vendettas.Perhaps I interpret the Harry Potter series far too much as a metaphor for the (mental) evolution of the first twenty years of any human life, but that's exactly also one of the main reasons why I think these films are so phenomenal. ""The Order of the Phoenix"" is a turning point in the franchise for several reasons. From here onwards, literally everything links back to the battle of good (Harry and friends) versus evil (Lord Voldemort and his army of darkness), but there are still plenty of significant sub plots. The loathsome and downright insufferable character of Dolores Umbridge is brilliant, for instance, since she so accurately represents every tiny but discouraging obstacle in life. Or: life is basically a long list of theoretical instructions and rules, but it just doesn't function like this.The fifth film also contains a lot more hectic action, uncompromising violence, realistic disillusions, and defeat. Well, such is life as well. But there's also stability to be found somewhere, like reliable old friendships and unexpected new support. The series itself finds its own stability, with director David Yates taking place in the director's seat and remaining there until the end of the series (plus spin-offs). I didn't think it was possible, but the ensemble cast just keeps getting better, with as most noteworthy new arrivals Imelda Staunton, Helena Bonham Carter, and Evanna Lynch.",8.0,Anonymous,Action
some of the worst editing in recent years,"I wanted to like this film. The thing that really made this film disappointing was the editing. The entire pace of the film is rushed, such that almost every scene ends abruptly or cuts out way to soon. I don't blame Yates for condensing a book that is over 800 pages long, but the film is TOO CONDENSED. This is proved in the total runtime of the movie, which is only a little over 2 hours, the shortest HP film yet. Ironic that the OotP is the LONGEST book in the series but the SHORTEST film in the franchise. Therefore, everyone other than Harry and Umbridge (who both give excellent performances) gets very little film time or very few lines. Major characters such as Ron, Dumbledore, Snape, Cho Chang, and Voldemort seem unimportant because they do so little. If you are a fan of the book, be warned, because the film leaves out A LOT of things and makes some changes. For example, in the Department of Mysteries, there are no revolving doors. The fight scene only takes place in 2 rooms. Although the last 20 minutes are really exciting, it would have been even better if they included the revolving doors. Also, the movie uses the newspaper flash technique as a means to give information that could otherwise be ACTED out in a scene, but i guess that would be to hard to do. It is obvious this technique is used to the directors advantage to shorten the films runtime, but it is used so much that it gets really annoying.",7.0,Anonymous,Action
I really liked this movie,There were some parts u were like come on get on with it but the movie overall was amazing!!! Everybody has different comments about it because everyone has different tastes... so for my tastes the movie was really the best harry potter movie yet...... i loved the whole scene fighting part at the end.... Most of the book was in there... they could have added just a couple more parts.... Can't wait for the book to come out... Overall in my opinion this was a very very good movie!!!! The part where they all fought against the death eaters was the best part in the movie... the scene where voldemort came out was very good too... but the fighting then was only between voldemort and dumbledore.... so i wish harry would have fought a bit in that... but oh well....You need to go and see this movie....,9.0,Anonymous,Action

Visually enthralling...Story wise awful...,"I am a Harry Potter fan. I have always loved the books. But i have always been disappointed by the movies. The first two were the best and stayed true to the story of the book. But since the third there's been a disastrous change.Talking about this movie particularly i was mainly disappointed and sad when i came out of the theater hall. The cgi and the special effects are really very good and convincing. But its the story where the movie suffers the most.If you've read the book you'll know that as far as understanding the Harry Potter universe is considered the 5th book is one of the most important. This movie was supposed to be the one that should have answered all the questions that a common viewer would have, having watched the movies without reading the book. It was supposed to tell us why Dumbledore never talked to Harry about his scar. Why he never said why he left Harry at his uncle's place when he was just a baby. Why he never explained the reason that Harry had to return to his uncle's place during all his vacations. Why it was because of him that Sirius was killed. And so many other questions that would have made the movie perfect in all respect.I felt that Harry's character was kind of over-shadowed by Hermione. It was like she was bossing him around and he was too much of a coward to take control.The movie could have been great in many other ways. I have just mentioned a few.All in all i'd give it a 6 just for the enthralling visuals and nothing else.",6.0,Anonymous,Action
