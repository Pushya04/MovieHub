Newman and Redford at Their Best,"""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is rightfully hailed as one of the greatest westerns ever made, although much of the movie takes place in South America.  It is a great look at two likeable outlaws, full of witty dialogue and exciting action sequences.Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and The Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) are two bank robbers, chased by the law.  The plot follows them as they travel to Bolivia after a railroad president hires a posse to hunt them do.  The story is mostly composed of short pieces telling a little story about them.  There is really no connection all the way through, for the most part.The story isn't about the plot, however.  It is about Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.  It is a close look at two criminals, the talented Sundance Kid, and Butch Cassidy, the one who does all the thinking.  The charisma and screen presence of the two actors and the way they work together is what drives the film.  Watching the two interact, with a superb script full of great dialogue, is what makes this movie so exciting.See this movie if you are a fan of westerns, or just a fan of good movies. It is exciting, superbly made (with lots of interesting silent scenes to music and montages of photographs), but it also has a lot of depth.**** out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid: A post modern Western,"George Roy Hill's funny Western is still modern and hasn't aged bad at all. Paul Newman is charming and charismatic, and Robert Redford is energetic. I don't know why some Western-fans doesn't like it because it is filled with powerful and spectacular gunfights, humor, friendship and beautiful pictures - which is the reasons why you watch Westerns, isn't it? I am fully aware of the fact that 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' was an unusual Western when it came. After this there were other attempts or experiments made like this but I don't think that they succeeded. 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' has also the rare ability to even smell, taste or feel classic when you watch it ... Robert Redford was never better than here.Rating: 9 of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""For a Moment There I Thought We Were In Trouble""","This is a great movie all around. It's a great Western, it's a great comedy, it's a great action, and it's a great drama. George Roy Hill did an excellent job with this movie. Paul Newman is one of my favorite actors, and who doesn't like Robert Redford? I just recently saw this movie and I was very pleased when it was over. They also managed to make this an accurate depiction, because, like the tagline states, for the most part, it's true.Paul Newman and Robert Redford do outstanding jobs as Butch and Sundance. They have make a great team, and it's fun to watch them rob trains and banks, and narrowly escape from the Pinkerton Posse. This movie also has great performances. The two actors make you like Butch and Sundance, and you want them to escape.I also thought it was interesting when I learned that the real Hole In The Wall Gang (besides Butch and Sundance)would soon become the Wild Bunch, or so I'm told. I find this movie a total enjoyment and can be enjoyed by anyone. I think that even the most shrill person can find things they like about this movie, so check it out, because it is and always will be a classic! 10/10",,Anonymous,Biography
A One of a Kind,"This has got to be one of my favorite westerns. It has everything you could possibly want for every movie fan. They're so many great aspect and I will attempt to display some of them.The acting, what can I say about it. It was a perfect fit for Redford and Newman who are both friends in the movie and real life. They deliver exhilarating, funny and electrifying performance. It is so great I can't even put it into words. These two actors were robbed of an at least an Oscar nomination. It has to be the biggest Oscar snub ever. Watching this movie my only wish is that Redford and Newman would have done more movies together.The writing was great and creative. I have never witnessed a movie that was so serious and yet so funny. The writing totally propelled this movie forward. The fact that Butch and Sundance went to Bolivia trying to outrun the law was hilarious. This has got to be some of the best writing ever.The directing by George Roy Hill was as well amazing displaying the chase scenes and just sitting back and letting the writing and directing take over. But most of all he let Robert Redford and Paul Newman do their thing. You could see that they were both feeding off each other and George Roy Hill never seemed to interrupt their chemistry.I would advise anyone and everyone to watch this. They are just so many laughs, many fun action scenes and of course Paul Newman and Robert Redford.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One Of The All-Time Great Westerns,"One of the best and most-liked films of the 1960s, this is still a fun movie to watch today. When I saw this on DVD on a nice flat-screen set, I was amazed how good this looked. I had seen it several times before on VHS and hadn't realized how good this was photographed. I just discovered Conrad Hall was the cinematographer, which explains it. Few, if any, were better than him.One remembers this western for several things: the two leads looking over their shoulders incredulous that their pursers seem to be always there; Paul Newman riding a bicycle to the tune of ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head,"" the beautiful Katharine Ross, the chemistry of Newman and Robert Redford as a two-man team, on and on. Those three lead actors, with the repartee between them, and the likability of each, make them fun to watch as they dominate this picture.It's just solid entertainment and another example of good film-making that doesn't need a lot of R-rated material to make it successful. Photography-wise, the western scenery was great, there were some wonderful closeup shots and I really liked the tinted old-time footage inserted in here.So, when you combine all the elements, it's no surprise this film won so many awards and endures so well.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best of the 60s & 70s,"This is pretty much the ultimate action western movie I can think of. This movie has everything you could want, and it appeals to almost any type of viewer. Paul Newman, one of if not the best actor of our time is the lead along with Robert Redford, the two go together perfectly, I dare say this is one of the best combinations in Hollywood history.Anyways the story takes place in the midwest, Newman and Redord run ""The Hole in the Wall Gang"" named after their hideout. They rob trains and take big scores, later the Pacific railroad gets together the best tracker and lawmen in the entire Western United States to track and kill Butch and Sundance. They must manage to evade their elite counterparts, the movie is 100 percent entertainment, especially during the chases. The movie is based on true events and is spectacular.This movie won Best Score, Best Song (Raindrops) which was very good untraditional music in a western, it fit good in this movie, Best Cinematography, shot by Conrad L. Hall who also did Road To Perdition, arguably the best cinematography done to this very day, and Adapated Screenplay, all for the right reasons. George Roy Hill, Paul Newman, and Robert Redford all went on to create ""The Sting"" in 1973, which is possibly one of the best movies ever made. I praise this movie, 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Gags and one-liners... but no atmosphere,"This movie foreshadows well the modern Hollywood blockbuster. It gets all its mileage out of individual gags that are sort of strung end-to-end, and there you have the movie. Everything is a bit light and fluffy, and the whole production seems to say ""Look! Heartthrob actors, dressed up like cowboys, doing cowboy stuff!"" It certainly has entertaining portions (along the lines of Hollywood's usual ""something for everyone""), but I wouldn't call it a good movie. Best watched after Sergio Leone's masterpieces have faded from memory. I didn't take that advice and found myself thinking ""this is so weak!""",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Carefree Outlaws,"Newman and Redford pair up for the first time as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid: a pair of outlaws that are perpetually robbing. They are so prolific with their robbing that they take their craft across the border into Bolivia. Not even a language barrier is going to stop them from taking other people's money.As much as this is about the wild lawless lifestyle of Butch and the SDK it is probably one of the first love triangles. Sundance is hook up with Etta Place (Katharine Ross) but it's clear that Butch loves her and she loves him. Somehow this criminal triumvirate does just fine emotionally where there is no outward hostility of one towards the other. I think that flowed from the light-heartedness of the movie. The movie was never too serious, even in the most dire times for the two protagonists. I think that was the biggest selling point for me. They were outlaws, and they would kill on occasion but it was almost like they were college frat boys who never stopped fratting. They lived life loose and carefree and nothing was going to change that.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One word.....Excellent,"I can remember seeing this movie, at the Colony Theater in Portsmouth Virginia, when it was first released. Since then, I've seen it at least 30 times, most recently last night. In my humble opinion, Paul Newman & Robert Redford made an excellent movie twosome 30 years ago [and expanded on it a few years later, in The Sting]. In reading the reviews submitted about this movie it makes me happy to see that most of the people agree with my opinion. How could you not like these characters, along with Etta, ""those guys"" following them and eventually Strother [who will always be remembered for his ""what we have here is a failure to communicate"" in Cool Hand Luke] Martin? Not to mention the scenes where Etta enters the picture, when Butch has to fight Logan, when they have to jump in the water and, of course, the ending sequence of events. I won't say ""they don't make them like they used to"", but this one is a keeper. And if you agree with my evaluation, and have a DVD player, watch the DVD that has interviews, etc., to give you an even better picture of this excellent movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Fun, but a tad slow.","Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid (1969) -I'm sure that many people will disagree with my opinion on this one. Maybe it will hold a special place in their heart, because they remember seeing it in the cinema or watching it with their parents, but I'm afraid that I found it hard to get excited by watching it for the first time in 2024. In fact it seemed pretty tame even by the standards of 1969.I quite liked the stylised way that the film was made, but it did make the story drag a bit, with diversions for bike rides and conversation instead of gun fights, shenanigans and whoring, as with a typical outlaw flick. It was really quite slow to start.Paul Newman always played his characters so well and with such charm and Butch Cassidy was no exception. But unusually for me I also liked Robert Redford's enigmaticism as The Sundance Kid too. It was a bit like watching Paul as 'Cool Hand Luke' (1967) or Rob from 'The Sting' (1973) so none of their performance was unexpected.I could give or take Katherine Ross in her role of Etta, she neither seemed to add or detract from the story, although the bicycle ride was sweet and something different from the usual western films that I've seen.If I'd been writing this screenplay though I probably would have made it a more obvious love triangle situation to add some extra drama, because bank robberies in westerns are a dime a dozen, where the romances, as it was here, tend to be something very simplistic and not exactly tender or loving. It might have added an extra layer to the plot and the romantic style of the filming, but I'm not sure how true it would have been to the real story of these heroes of the Wild West.Although I have seen many films about, Billy The Kid, Pat Garrett and Wyatt Earp I didn't actually know anything about these two outlaws for me to say if the depiction was accurate, but I also don't feel as if I know much more now, because this interpretation could easily blend in with others of the Western ilk that I have seen due to its lack of nothing new.I did find it odd that it almost seemed as if Butch and Sundance didn't even really know each other that well, which made their friendship seem a bit fake or maybe too new for them to have such faith in each other. Like asking Brian from accounts to be your wingman on your first night out with a new company, only to find out that he has no luck with the ladies. The relationship hadn't established enough to build their knowledge of each other, which belied the stalwart dedication between them. In that respect I might have appreciated more of their origin story, rather than jumping straight in to their later exploits.Weirdly the musical track, with its inclusion of B. J. Thomas' 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head', worked, especially alongside the sepia photo montages. However it did feel as if the script should have been a lot more comical to go with it, more akin to 'Cat Ballou' (1965) perhaps. The actors in the leading roles were well known for making people laugh after all.It just wasn't as action packed as I felt it should have been either. A large part of the film seemed to just be the titular characters running away a lot.I also noted that even I could probably have tracked them across the country with all of the noise and dust they were kicking up. It was a surprise that they hadn't been caught previously.In general though the film was alright, but it didn't wow me. Perhaps I'd expected too much from it. The characters are legends of course, as are the actors, so I felt that this particular interpretation had a reputation to live up to and it didn't.600.89/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sometimes it's hard to see what others see,"Usually if you find that you don't like a film which has been deemed a classic you can at least see what it may be that leads people to think so highly of the film. That is not the case with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. I don't get it. I'm not seeing what so many others apparently are seeing. I see an incredibly overrated film that is not even remotely worthy of the near mythical status it has attained. Whatever it is that supposedly makes this film a classic is well and truly lost on me.The biggest problem with the film is that nobody involved apparently could decide what kind of film it was they were making. Was it a serious Western or a comedy Western? The film ends up stuck in some sort of netherworld in between. It's much too jokey to take very seriously but not nearly funny enough to be labeled a comedy. The film tries to be multiple things and ends up not being much of anything at all. It's a film that never really convinces, things always seem a bit off. Just the very concept that the ""good guys"", the guys we're meant to sympathize with and root for, are actually the bad guys was always going to be a little jarring. Hooray for the train robbers! It could have worked but it really doesn't. No fault of the actors as Paul Newman and Robert Redford, Newman especially, make the characters of Butch and Sundance respectively easy to like. And Sundance's girl, played by Katharine Ross, certainly has her charms as well. But even if you end up liking these characters it's still hard to like the movie.You would think it would be hard to make a boring movie based on the exploits of notorious bank and train robbers. But that's pretty much what we have here. This film moves at a snail's pace, moments of excitement are few and far between. The interminable chase sequence dropped into the middle of the film surely doesn't help. If I had to watch Butch peer into the distance and say ""Who are those guys?"" one more time I'd scream. Get on with it already. Honestly for much of its running time this movie has you desperately trying to stifle yawns. And when the movie tries to have a little fun it generally doesn't work. So many jokes which fall flat. And that famous, yet exceedingly dopey, bicycle sequence. Hard to take the movie seriously after that. Good song though. I just have no idea what in the world it's doing in this movie. One thing you can say for the movie is that it is beautifully photographed. Cinematographer Conrad Hall's Oscar was well earned. And Newman and Redford, both of course terrific actors, do have very good chemistry and Ross fits in well also. The interactions among the three lead performers provide some good moments. But there are not nearly enough of those moments to salvage the film. It's dull and drawn out, it's neither serious enough to work as a real Western or funny enough to get by on comedic value. The film just doesn't work. But it's a ""classic"". I don't get it.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Another Winner From the ""Class of 1969""","""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is a great film just due to the pairing of Paul Newman and Robert Redford. These two work so well together that the film would have been impressive no matter what. However, with a smart story and great direction by George Roy Hill, ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" was the smash-hit of 1969 as it achieved box office dominance and won more Oscars (four) than any other film that year. It did not win the Best Picture or Best Director Oscars as ""Midnight Cowboy"" and its director John Schlesinger took home those honors, but it has stood the test of time and is right up there with the other imperative films of that important year (""Midnight Cowboy"", ""Easy Rider"", and ""The Wild Bunch""). The two titled characters are two shrewd outlaws who love to rob trains and banks. However, the law has about had it with the outlaws and the two decide that Bolivia is the place they need to be. Also along for the ride is school-teacher Katharine Ross who obviously has feelings for both men. They both want to go straight in Bolivia, but temptation is too big for them and in the end tragedy will occur for the titled characters. Of course this film is based on real people, but so little is known about them that the film-makers were able to take many liberties with the tale. The film-makers went for comedy and action, but it is the drama and the likable characters that make ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" one of the best films produced in the 1960s. 5 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Biography
A Perfect Script For a Near-Perfect Movie,"""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is one of the greatest movies ever made.  It is my favorite film of all time, and the biggest reason for that is because of its script by William Goldman.  It's very rare in film that a script has perfect lines in it from beginning to end, but this film is an example of what can be achieved by Hollywood screenwriters. It was William Goldman's script of this movie that sparked my passion for the American cinema.  Though most Westerns of the cinema past have serious and gritty tones to them, this film has just the right mix of comedy, wit, and adventure.  The greatest team in Hollywood history, arguably, is the team of Paul Newman and Robert Redford.  The presence by these two Hollywood legends has help cement this film as one of the greatest movies ever made - according to organizations like the American Film Institute.  The direction by George Roy Hill is first rate, and much credit also has to be given to cinematographer Conrad Hall, who did a great job giving this film the superior look of the Old West.Katherine Ross adds to this film in the role as the beautiful Etta Place, as does the score, which makes us feel good about going to the movies.  This was the film that, for the first time, got audiences to root for ""the bad guys"".  This film should be shown in every film school to show film students how to make a theatrical film.  I will always love this movie, and indeed, this movie is something special.  It is also special to me because the REAL Sundance Kid was born in my hometown of Phoenixville, Pennsylvania.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Deserves its reputation as a classic,"After the special posse of experts is finally formed and is pursuing them too well, Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) move their bank robbing business to South America accompanied by the Kid's girlfriend, Etta (Katharine Ross).This was the breakout role for Robert Redford's movie career (Redford named the ""Sundance Institute"" and the annual ""Sundance Film Festival"" that he founded in honor of this effect). While some respected critics, e.g., Roger Ebert & many others (see the 50% ratings of 'rotten' by 'top critics' reviews of this film on ""Rotten Tomatoes"") regard this movie as overdone or only ""so-so,"" or ""not western enough,"" most viewers find it still greatly entertaining and interesting.I agree with the majority: it remains remarkably fresh and fun. There's so much clever banter throughout between the two stars, it borders on comedy (so much we become oblivious to the scores of people we see killed during the story's unfolding). Its Oscar winning screenplay very much draws on actual people and events (but please see Wikipedia's article on Butch Cassidy for how closely the movie mirrors reality). The actual lives and activities of Butch & the Sundance Kid are almost over the top--and so is this movie, too.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Boy, I've got vision and the rest of the world wears bifocals.""","Although there are many ways to do a Western, they largely fall into two different categories: the stoic, law-and-order-focused John Wayne type, and the more cynical ones epitomized by Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid provides an alternative third way which focuses more on the margins instead of the centers of power and does so in a more lighthearted manner. I found this really fun, in no small part because of Paul Newman and Robert Redford's chemistry. And for the most part that was able to help me ignore the structural unevenness and inconsistent pacing. Katharine Allen also did well, but her role felt underwritten. And Strother Martin, in a sort-of Cool Hand Luke reunion with Newman, left a positive impact with his limited screentime.

Doesn't live up to the hype,"I am a big fan of westerns, and of Newman and Redford. I think the Sting is one of the greatest crime movies of all time. But this movie just isn't that exciting. It doesn't have those memorable moments that a lot of these classic westerns do. You would think with the star-power they would make the average script a classic, but I guess not in my books. I know a lot of people love this movie, but like Blade Runner, I just don't see why.To start, there just isn't much plot. The premise is they steal money and then runaway from bad guys (who by the way you never even get to really see). I would have been fine if they built up these bad guys like the did and then at the end have a classic gun fight, but it turns out its with a foreign country at the end instead of the guys who have been chasing them the whole time. Also, how do they get back to Katharine Ross' character? weren't they chased without horses miles away? Then the next morning they are all of a sudden there. Maybe that's nitpicking but if I noticed it, its a mistake. I just felt like this movie fell short on several levels.But even though I didn't like the end bad guys, I did like the final gun fight, I thought it at least put some excitement onto a rather boring movie. Besides the negatives I did think Newman and Redford were fine in their roles but I cant say I will remember anything particular that they said to each other. I realize all film is subjective, and most people love this movie, but that's just not me.6.7/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Ya Think You Used Enough Dynamite There Butch?""","George Roy Hill's best film and one of the best western movies as well as buddy movies ever made.

Western? No  but a warming and funny gentle comedy,"Cassidy and Sundance are part of the Hole in the Wall gang.  However the West is becoming harder for criminals and soon they find themselves the target of a posse.  Wherever they go they are followed.  Eventually they travel to Bolivia to escape the heat, but can they manage to go straight?This is one of the slightest and flimsiest westerns of modern days.  Even Young Guns has more cohesive plotting than this.  However that's not what this is all about.  For all it's lightness it is really, really good fun. To all intents and purposes it's a comedy regardless of the period it is set in.  The plot does little but provide some funny chases and ample oppourtunity for the two stars to play off each other to great effect.Ross is good but really this is only Newman and Redford's film, and they play it well.  Both have a great rapport with the other and it adds to the bickering etc.  Their lines are all great and the film lives and dies with them.  It has slow portions and bits that don't really work too well, but as long as Newman and Redford are on screen then fun is never too far away.Overall this is not a great western, but as a classic buddy comedy it's bang on.

The shootout in the end best demonstrates the comradery and the brotherhood that the two share. I can't figure out why the soundtrack from this movie won so many awards.  It wasn't terrible but it sure wasn't spectacular.  Oh well, such is politics.      The balance of humor and drama was superb, transitioning between each other like clockwork.

"""You Keep Thinking Butch, That's What Your Good At""","It's interesting that a film Midnight Cowboy about a street hustler managed to beat out a western about a couple of real western characters for Best Picture of 1969. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is simply one of the best westerns ever made, it's got wit, and charm, and will get you positively infectious in your enthusiasm for it.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid has the incomparable team of Paul Newman and Robert Redford. George Roy Hill the director had a stroke of inspirational genius teaming the two of them.They both play a different character. Butch Cassidy is the amiable thinker and planner for the Hole in the Wall gang. Outlaw that he is Paul Newman is so charming in the role you have to root for him. He's a guy who thinks fast on his feet. Note what happens right at the beginning of the film when Ted Cassidy, best known for being Lurch the butler on the Addams Family challenges him for the gang leadership. It's one of my favorite scenes.But even better is Newman with George Furth as the dedicated employee of the Union Pacific Railroad in two scenes where this stubborn little clerk tries to singlehandedly stop the robbery. Furth in fact is my favorite character part in the film.Of course Newman is backed up by the laconic fast draw The Sundance Kid as played by Robert Redford. He's got a nice quiet menace about him, but you can tell how much affection he has for Newman. What comes through is these guys genuinely like each other on and off the screen.Katharine Ross plays Etta Place who was Sundance's mistress. I liked her also, she's a survivor and one grateful for the good and bad times she's had. Ross is a former schoolteacher and she went into the relationship with her eyes open with no regrets. But the most poignant moment in the film is when she tells both of the men that she'll go with them to Bolivia after the USA has gotten too hot for them and do whatever they want, but she won't watch them inevitably die because they can't change with the times.A lot of the same themes are expressed in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid as were done in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. The difference is that Butch and Sundance have a ton of redeeming qualities whereas Liberty Valance has none.B.J. Thomas's rendition of the Academy Award winning song Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head is what people remember most about this film. It's certainly one of the most recognized movie themes ever written. Besides Thomas, good records of the song were done by Andy Williams, Perry Como and Dean Martin.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid won some other technical Oscars including a most deserved one for cinematography. It missed being Best Picture and Best Director for George Roy Hill.In the only western he ever did in his career George Roy Hill came up with one of the best. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid should be seen back to back with The Sting. Hard to say which one is the better.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Stands the test of time...,"Revisiting Butch and Sundance in 2002, 33 years after initial release, this film certainly stands the test of time... it was as funny yet poignant today as it was back then.

Overrated by still interesting,"Perhaps I'm too fond of the traditional Hollywood western and the great 'spaghetti' westerns of Sergio Leone, but ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" strikes me as a clumsy attempt to adapt them to the changing sensibilities of the late 1960s.Gone are some clichés that we actually liked, like the sweeping orchestral score that seemed as majestic as the landscapes on screen, but still present are some of the clichés I could do without, like the invincible ""fastest draw in the west"" outlaw and the hapless, submissive woman. The movie does, to its credit, replace the traditional one-dimensional gunslinger with characters with at least some emotional depth, and perhaps that is its most enduring update of the western style.The story is alright, amusing in parts, as the duo's exploits cause them to be pursued by the greatest trackers in the west, forcing them to flee to Bolivia. The movie relies almost entirely on the chemistry between Newman and Redford, as there is just a token effort to build drama and suspense through the traditional tools of the western.The overall effect seems clumsy, especially with its inexplicably anachronistic soundtrack, but I do respect that this movie was apparently exactly the sort of ""western"" that audiences wanted in 1969. As a movie in the great pantheon of westerns, I don't think it stacks up to the greats, but it is certainly worth watching for its novel, if goofy, take on the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Trust Newman-Redford to deliver.....with Extremely Beautiful photography.,"This is one of the most entertaining and satisfying westerns of all time. There are many factors which works wonder in favor of this movie. Among them:1. The biggest plus point for this movie to be what it is, is the casting of Newman, Redford and Ross. Apart from the obvious declaration that screen chemistry between Newman-Redford is one of the best of all times, chemistry between Newman-Ross and Redford-Ross are some of the other highlights of the movie. Especially, Newman-Ross scene where they ride in a bicycle is pure joy to watch with the background musical score. Not to mention each scene where Newman and Redford share together are some of the finest moment's cinema lover could ask for.2.The other major selling point of this movie is that it doesn't have the usual elements of most other westerns which are there all the times i.e., needless bloodshed/ revenge plot/ gun tricks and so on. So this way it was a complete different viewing experience for me and I enjoyed it a lot. Hero here is not interested in taking revenges, he is not very thrilled by the prospect of killing, and he knows the odds against him when there are many villains involved. And yet he does the things westerners do, like robbing trains, loving women, and killing when utmost necessary.3. Other major factor is the Cinematography. I won't be exaggerating when I suggest that this is the foremost beautiful movie to be photographed, ever! The picturesque landscapes, the white flowing river and everything from day-night to train to houses to people are all so meticulously captured on the camera and with such beautiful, smooth colors that I am totally amazed by this work. Hats off to Conrad Hall for his marvelous efforts.4. Background music is really good, especially in the bicycle scene and in general throughout the movie. It is very different from music so often related to westerns.5. Direction is superb, dialogs are smart and witty.I have tried to cover all the pluses that came to my mind, but still feel I missed some although some on purpose because if I start writing on those it will take more time for me to finish this comment. Especially particular scenes of Newman-Redford but all of them are so good, full of wit, that it won't be fair to comment only on some. So if you have or will watch the movie then you might know what task I have here to write about some of them. Overall, one of the finest westerns of all time, and yet so different from most other films of this genre.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A classic legendary western tale of two criminals that works due to the chemistry of the leads and it teases.,"1969's ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is clearly a classic western as it does a pretty good job of the retelling of the two legendary bank robbing western criminal outlaws. And the film is done in a way that pleased most viewers even though the western genre is not everyone's cup of tea, still the action and gunfire is traditional enough to make any old time viewer feel at home and have a classic feel. Yet as you watch much of the film from the robberies, hold ups and getaways and even the acting you will feel a tease as I for one feel this film is a big tease of chase and go that spotlights it being fun to be on the run as a criminal. Anyway still the acting and chemistry is what makes the film as the two leads who in 1969 were clearly just getting in their prime are wonderful as Paul Newman is wise and bright as the old criminal mastermind Butch Cassidy and the young and shining Robert Redford is in fine form as the up and coming outlaw Sundance. And Katherine Ross gives a good supporting turn as the shared love squeeze of both outlaws. Overall the film is a feel good journey of on the run getaway after getaway journey as in it's time in 1969 was a defining film for it's time period. Yet it's stood to be a classic due to the teasing style of outlaw fun and the chemistry and classy performances of two legends like Redford and Newman made it stand the test of film history time.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Legend of the famous outlaws becomes in-jokey star-vehicle,"Director George Roy Hill's film of the famous bank robbers of the Old West treats its subjects like modern pop icons, with Paul Newman and Robert Redford not giving performances so much as cutting up for their own bemusement. The film is commercially shaggy and loose, but utterly shallow and unsubstantial. Even in 1969, nobody could explain the reasoning for Newman's balletic bicycle ride scored with Burt Bacharach (today that sequence could be an outtake), while Katharine Ross (as schoolmarm Etta Place) looks positively stiff standing amongst the red-blooded machismo. Ross also gets the worst lines in the script, about darning socks and lovin' her man until he dies. Hill plays up the buddy-buddy chemistry for all it's worth, and the movie was a huge hit, though it's cartoony in the worst way--like a joy-buzzer--and leaves a bad taste behind. **1/2 from ****",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Am I the only one who wasn't as into this movie as others?,"I have heard a lot about Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, story and movie wise. I enjoyed The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly so much that I decided to give Western movies another shot, maybe I just didn't appreciate them more when I was young. But Butch Cassidy was pretty slow paced and doesn't even have much of a story. So why the big fuss? Robert Redford and Paul Newman had good chemistry and I did believe in their friendship and partnership sort of speak. This movie was also beautifully shot, so there are a few points where I can say I had a positive view on the movie.But I felt like there was no story and it just wasn't really my type of movie that I could get into. I hope most of IMDb users understand, we've all been there. But if you want my opinion for those of you who don't enjoy Westerns, only stick to The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. If you want to, give Butch Cassidy a chance, but I did warn you.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Best Beatles Movie,"The question is not whether this film is good, but why it was so phenomenally popular, and is remembered so fondly.Unless you were there, it is hard to understand the context. This is a Beatles movie in Bonnie and Clyde clothes. Check out the John and Paul caracatures, complete with Sgt Pepper moustache. The photography is ripped out of Warren Beatty's mind, and casually surrealistic. The musical scenes, especially the bike scene, are inspired by the Hard Days' Night school.A distance from reality is established in every detail: the overexposed photography often lapsing into sepia, the anachronistic dialog, the `look at me relax' approach to acting, and the abstract, supernatural posse composed of legends who are not supposed to come here. Someone was able to put his finger on how to package a revolution for consumption. This commercialization is of course why the greater promise of that revolution never appeared.This film made Robert Redford famous, a generous soul and minor talent, and it is easy to see why he would be proud. But Paul Newman knew better even then, and I suppose he regrets having participated. No matter, he has real legacies.When I reviewed it last week, the Beatle connection was immediately obvious. And I was struck by the Katherine Ross character. In 1969, how we wished Yoko had been like that.",,Anonymous,Biography
Could this really have been the beginning of Sundance?,"A truly revisionist western in the best sense of the term, ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" was one of the quintessential American movies of the sixties; a huge commercial success and showered with Oscars. Over the years it has gone somewhat out of fashion but it is still a ground-breaking classic no matter how you look at it. It moves seamlessly between seriousness and a beautifully honed comic sensibility continually buoyed up by one of the greatest of all screenplays by William Goldman, too jokey for some, perhaps, but clever, myth-making and intelligent and while many movies that seemed so much of their period or which wore their influences a little too obviously, (in this case, the French New Wave), ""Butch ... and Sundance ..."" certainly isn't one of them.Admittedly Newman and Redford coast their way through the film; they look like they are having too much fun. This is laconic acting at its most laconic, but Conrad Hall's photography is still stunning so the film looks as good as it sounds. I have no doubt that George Roy Hill's subsequent Newman/Redford pairing ""The Sting""'s best picture Oscar was one given to make up for ""Butch's"" failure to take home the big prize.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bad Guys are Good Guys: Best Comedy-Drama Western of All Time,"If there is a list of movies that defied most film conventions at the time of their release, ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" would have to be on the list. Before ""Butch Cassidy"", the typical western involved good guys with white hats and bad guys with black hats, basically John Wayne versus Jack Palance, and the winner was already foretold. And few of these offerings had much in the way of character study and/or development. ""Butch Cassidy"" warped the conventional and created a very different way of looking at the genre. From one angle, you might argue its a parody of the American western. On another angle, its a character study. Or is it a comedy? Some of the lines are better than most comedies filmed today. And it is also a drama with tragic elements. ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid "" is all these things.""Butch Cassidy"" parodies the traditional American western by focusing on two outlaws as its main characters and giving them beloved humanity. They are even described as ""two-bit outlaws on the dodge"" in one scene. And yet, we are drawn into their story in a way you might expect being drawn into the story of two good guys. The lawmen of the movie, who are chasing Butch and Sundance, are like specters. We see them from afar barely visible, often riding in the distance a mile or so from our ""heros"". They appear ominous and unforgiving in a way you might think of the typical bad guy riding into town in movies made only 10-20 years before ""Butch Cassidy"". We find ourselves fearing the ""good guys"" and loving the ""bad guys"".The movie is a complex character study of its two leads. It's impossible now to imagine this film working as well as it does without the talents of Paul Neuman and Robert Redford in which a strange and unpredictable chemistry evolved. As the movie progresses, the relationship of Butch and Sundance is gradually revealed. Sundance is the more erratic and high-strung of the two while Cassidy is the intellectual criminal, analyzing situations, although both are portrayed as highly intelligent. At one point, Sundance says, ""You just keep thinking, Butch, that's what you're good at.""The comedic elements of ""Butch Cassidy"" should be celebrated as much as its other aspects. The movie brims with wonderful innuendos, sly remarks, and interesting sarcasm. At one point, the issue of Sundance's girl going with them comes up, and he tells her that he wants no wining or complaining, or ""I'm dumping you flat."" To which Cassidy says, ""Don't sugar-coat it, kid. Tell her straight."" This kind of humor permeates the entire film, with some of the best humor erupting in the middle of desperate situations.And finally, ""Butch Cassidy"" is a tragedy, or at least a tragic-comedy. (No wedding at the end.) At the beginning of the tale, the characters are light-hearted bandits in which they rob trains but always sympathize with the passengers, and even the poor bastard hired by the railroads to guard the ""loot"". At one point Cassidy tells him ""Whatever they're paying you it ain't enough."" But then the tide turns as the railroads fight back and hire a sophisticated posy to hunt down and destroy the fun-loving outlaws. The film becomes an interesting study in how these two outlaw stars must now face their greatest foe. It should be noted that the real Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid were ruthless killers who engaged in many gunfights where they mercilessly slaughtered their foes long before they went to Bolivia. Their portrayal in this 1969 film is not really history, but the story works on its own terms.Few filmmakers would attempt to combine all these elements in a single story, and yet the film works on every level. Maybe in a way, although it has these elements of comedy, drama, character, and tragedy, it is ultimately just a well-told story of two guys who happen to be bandits.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Different, but a great movie all the same","I know there are people who love or don't like this film, but I am one of those who loves it. It is a different kind of western, but in my mind, that is not a bad thing, quite the contrary. I loved the first ten minutes, that was very clever and refreshing. The cinematography is fabulous, doing perfect justice to the beautiful scenery. The score is suitably jaunty, and the Raindrops Falling on My Head interlude is a wonderful touch and quite moving come to think of it. The script is witty and infectious, not to mention memorable, and the direction and pace I had no problem with either. Robert Redford and especially Paul Newman are perfect as the charismatic outlaws and their chemistry is simply unforgettable. All in all, just a great movie and one of my favourites of the genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Sting is better,"While Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid has certain charms. It is totally lacking in depth. The characters wise crack like
Hope and Crosby in a road movie. There is tons of filler like the middle sepia sequence with the trio in NYC. and then on the train to Bolivia. Plus speaking of trio what's up with the one woman two men friendship? Wouldn't Newman at some point get jealous?. And that terrible dabba dabba da soundtrack during the endless chase sequence in Bolivia. Basically,we are cheering for bank robbers and killers just because its Newman and Redford. On the plus side the movie looks great , it has the realistic feel of the 1880s , despite the dialogue and there is a chemistry between Newman and Redford that keeps it entertaining at least until Bolivia.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Impressive western film,"To tell the truth, there are very few western films that I actually see. ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is a rare exception. This film truly is not your average western. For one thing, the film does not revolve around good guys vs. bad guys the entire time. It's more of a story about Butch and Sundance themselves. The movie can be humorous at times, throwing in tons of little bits of intelligent verbal comedy, as most great films throughout time have been able to do. Robert Redford shows a side of brilliant acting with lines such as those in his ""Can I move?"" scene in which he cannot simply stand still and shoot his target. Paul Newman is also especially good, interjecting some wit and sarcasm that make this film so enjoyable. This movie also introduced ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head,"" one of the best original songs in movie history. Though I like Newman and Redford's second film together (""The Sting"") even better, this is still a great film on its own. Perhaps it's only the film's ending that makes this movie less than perfect for me. Though it is more historically accurate, it does provide somewhat of a sense of disappointment here. Nevertheless, the rest of the film is nearly perfect, very enjoyable and worthwhile. A classic, and one of the best films of the 60s.***1/2 out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid,"I'm watching this movie for my history through film class. We are doing reviews on movies. The plot of the movie is about two robbers who robbed a train and it went wrong. They run all the way to Bolivia where they rob banks. They have multiple people trying to find them. What I noticed about the movie that is because of how long ago it was made was the sound quality. It didn't sound that good when it came to voices. I thought it was still good though. The acting was good as well. They did a good western impression. There is nothing I question about the historical accuracy. I know this is supposed to be a legend. There are no connections I made with other movies. This is the first Western style movie I've watched. Three things I liked were the actors. I liked the over plot and story.

Has anyone over age 20 NOT seen this film?,"I can't believe this movie was made in 1969. But then I look at how YOUNG Newman and Redford are in the film and how craggy and 'well-seasoned' they look now and figure, yeah, that was a long time ago. The pairing of these two actors was brilliant; the chemistry between them, the way they can play off each other's strengths, was recaptured years later in The Sting. BC and the SDK starts of as a loopy set piece of two giddy train robbers just living from one holdup to the next one - but then they rob the wrong guy and he hires a world-class tracker (""Who ARE those guys?"") who just won't give up. They keep running - all the way to Bolivia. And okay, maybe the bicycle scene in the meadow with Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head is schmaltzy - but didn't you love it? And don't you remember that scene every time you hear the song on the radio? A movie really doesn't get much better than this.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good fun. Not great.,"www.ourfilmreviews.com ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is an okay, fun movie but not nearly the masterpiece of cinema that the majority of critics seem to believe it is. I first saw it when I was a kid and had fond memories of it, but watching it again the other night I was met with a certain degree of disappointment. The acting is good (Paul Newman is always great. Redford does a fine job but it is really Newman's movie) and the one-liners are memorable, but the story is so disjointed and one-dimensional that the film doesn't reach any level beyond that of a lighthearted adventure flick.The critic James Berardinelli praises the movie for taking the Western genre into more lighthearted territory. He writes, ""The movie is jovial without being silly; it retains the sense of adventure that characterizes the Western, but replaces the often somber mood with one that is airy and, at times, almost comedic. As directors like Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone took the Western in one direction, George Roy Hill and William Goldman threw audiences a curve ball by opting for the road less traveled – and were rewarded with a success."" I don't mind that the movie gives the Western genre a lighthearted and jovial spin. The problem is the film fails to connect the jovial events in the movie to a deeper understanding of its characters and thus fails to move beyond the lightheartedness. Lightheartedness and jocularity are good and fun, but they just aren't sufficient on their own to make for great cinema. They make for lighthearted and jocular cinema, not greatness. Since Berardinelli mentions Sergio Leone, let's for a moment compare the movie to Leone's masterpiece ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly."" Leone's film treads into jovial territory as well, but the jocularity does not consume the film. The film also contains a gritty seriousness, a look into the greedy, dark heart of man, and a suspenseful climax. As a result, the film is a much more satisfying western and a more satisfying cinematic experience than the rather one-dimensional ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."" The film follows a very simple cause-and-effect narrative that plays out like this: Butch and Sundance rob trains. Butch and Sundance are chased by the authorities. Butch and Sundance flee to Bolivia with Sundance's girlfriend. Butch and Sundance rob banks in Bolivia. Butch and Sundance are chased by the Bolivian authorities. The End. All the while the two leads are given pithy witticisms for every occasion. For the most part, these escapades are great fun. The film is very funny at points, as when Butch uses too much dynamite on a train's bank safe. When it explodes, the entire car is blown to smithereens and the money floats down all around the rubble. My favorite scene of the movie is when Butch and Sundance attempt to rob a Bolivian bank, only to get frustrated by the language barrier and walk out. The middle part of the movie, however, suffers from poor editing and a lagging narrative. When the authorities (an apparent ensemble of the best law enforcers and headhunters in the west) are chasing the duo, the chase consists of nothing more than long, sweeping shots of Butch and Sundance on horseback, riding at full speed through the landscape. This is the point in the movie when you should use the restroom or make yourself a snack. You will miss nothing in terms of narrative or character development and the shots of the landscape are too dull to deserve our interest.The film also features the pop hit ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head,"" a song written by Burt Bacharach for the film. The song is featured in a random montage of Newman riding a bike with Katharine Ross' character. There is very little development of the Ross character and no development of her relationship to Butch prior to the montage. As a result, the whole sequence seems out of place. While it is a catchy little tune, its use in the movie is indicative of the film's shortcoming as whole. The filmmakers had a catchy song on their hands so they made a random montage to set the song to. The montage was inserted into the film so that the movie could boast featuring what they knew would be a radio hit, even though the montage is basically useless to the film as a whole. In the same way, it seems like the film was primarily used as a chance to use Paul Newman in a big production western. The producers were able to sign a big star, so they made a movie for him.In conclusion, ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is a fun movie worth seeing. Paul Newman is his typical great self, Redford makes a lasting impression (the film launched him into stardom), and there are some very good comical sequences, but the film fails at being anything more than good Hollywood fluff. Good for sure, but far from great.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

...But Once They Ruled The West!,"In the 1950s and 1960s, adventure movies were often Westerns. In later years, they were just as often buddy movies. ""Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid"" is kind of where one became the other. It's lasted because it's so good, and also because it did some things that were unusual at the time but became very customary soon after.It's funny to read the comments from people knocking this film as a form of praising ""The Wild Bunch."" They were both westerns made in 1969, and the main characters in both are outlaws, but there's not much else they have in common other than Strother Martin and Latinos dying in slo-mo. Disparaging ""Butch Cassidy"" because it's not ""Wild Bunch"" is like attacking ""Star Wars"" for not being ""Gone With The Wind.""I think ""Wild Bunch"" is great, too, but in a much different way, tough, mean, and brutal. ""Butch Cassidy"" is a sunny charmer, aimed squarely at the mainstream but with nice touches throughout that surprise you with their understated brilliance. The opening kinescope sequence; the sepia washing into the blue horizon as Butch and Sundance ride away from the card game; the still photograph section during the trip to New York, and especially the powerful last shot. There's nothing crazy or clever about the film, except when you realize it was designed to attract theater goers and did so despite taking so many chances within its conventional form.The music riles some. You can read them all here. ""Bacharach and David were totally wrong for this type of movie, what's with all those 'Dating Game' tunes, I fast-forward through the bicycle part, etc."" As Sundance would say of these criticisms: ""Bitch, bitch, bitch!"" ""Butch Cassidy"" works because it is anachronistic. It's not cinema verite, it's not trying to seem real for a second. The kinescope bit at the beginning is your clue, this is a western movie that's fully aware of its nature as a movie, and expects the same from the audience.That being said, I'd like to add that the bicycle sequence is my favorite part, because of the great song, the wordless interaction of Paul Newman and Katharine Ross, the way the sunlight dapples the lace curtains and the caramel locks of Etta's hair. It's also something else, too, the one moment of peace Butch gets and an oddly effective grace note in his otherwise miserable life. The look he gives the bull after crashing through the fence is not just cute but summarizes in one priceless instant Butch's approach to life's travails throughout the film.I used to think the chase part went on too long, but now I just sit back and enjoy the banter, and the gorgeous scenery. (I don't know where Conrad Hall shot this picture, but I have a hard time believing it was anywhere on Planet Earth.) Nothing else to complain about with this one, nothing.Obviously the most appealing aspect of this film are the two leads. Its a happy miracle that with all the big names being bandied around, we ended up with Newman and Robert Redford. Warren Beatty and Steve McQueen wouldn't have worked not because of inferior acting skills but inferior chemistry. Newman and Redford work so well with each other because they aren't competing but playing off each other. They are actors, and they have egos, but there's no stench of narcissism connected to this movie. That's why it's so enjoyable even through the slow stretches, and why it's a shame Newman and Redford only did one other movie together after this.George Roy Hill directed that movie, ""The Sting,"" as well as this, and it's bewildering how little credit he seems to get for his work. Sure, he won an Oscar for ""The Sting,"" and was nominated for one for this, but he's nearly forgotten today. Maybe it's because he was so versatile. Hill made ""Slap Shot"" and ""The World Of Henry Orient;"" two films as far apart as any in terms of demographic appeal. ""Butch Cassidy"" is one of the most inventive, successful mainstream films ever made, and it's inventive and successful because Hill was the man with the plan behind it.One other thing: If you like this movie but don't have this on DVD, get it. If you don't have a DVD player, it's worth having for the ""Butch"" DVD alone. It's a generously front-loaded item featuring gorgeous imaging, an informative commentary track, penetrating interviews with all the stars looking back, and most especially a documentary Hill narrated a year after the film came out which details the many challenges he confronted making this movie. Hill's final line in that documentary is a gem!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Shared billing of Newman and Redford make a classic,"Though it would later be cemented when they re-teamed with George Roy HIll in 1973's ""The Sting,"" Paul Newman and Robert Redford create one of the greatest film duos in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."" You'd be hard pressed to find two names that lit up a marquis together like these two back in their day and its exactly what makes a film like ""Butch Cassidy"" go from good to timeless.No, the film wouldn't be nothing without them, but it's their over-masculine insults trying to mask their deep care for one another that makes them both funny and endearing, as does their care-free attitude about theft. Hill reflects all of this in his film and it makes it that much better.The movie follows its titular outlaws in the twilight of their infamous careers. Their reputation precedes them and their age, particularly Butch's, catches up with them. Throughout the film is a sense that times are changing and that they won't be able to keep robbing banks and trains forever, an appropriate and meaningful foreshadow that affects the film. Things stay good for part of the film, but eventually someone is on their trail and they're just as crafty. Butch and Sundance go on the run, unable to shake them off the trail.Newman brings his usual swagger to the role of Butch. He's clearly aging, but his idealism and vision for finding the next big job never fades, even when it gets him into trouble. Newman carries the perfect sense of humor and is never afraid to make Butch seem vulnerable, as legendary as he is. Redford is the skilled, more easily angered of the two, always keeping his logic handy. He's always quick to insult Butch but always quick to defend him. The unspoken bond between these two is strong and excellent.The cinematography in this film is top notch, especially in the beginning. Conrad L. Hall gives these men the mystique, makes each scene feel like a tall tale or a legend. It's really quite beautiful and the changes from sepia to living color sell this mood even more. Even more than the images, the choice of scoring this film is the most interesting and daring choice of all. Burt Bacharach provides an old saloon theme, a more positive tune as his only scoring and then writes the classic tune ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"" to accompany a care-free montage. The music echoes not the danger and peril as would a typical Western score, but the joy and timelessness of the story. It seems strange at first, but it's the right choice given the film's themes.No one forgets a great on-screen tandem and that is Newman and Redford. There's an undeniable chemistry between them though they are both strong enough to star on their own. It's this duel alpha male butting of heads that makes them play off each other so well and ultimately not be a contest of upstaging. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"In real life, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were hardened bank robbers.In this movie, director George Roy Hill is influenced by the French New Wave and the late 1960s counterculture. Bonnie and Clyde was released a year earlier.With the the aid of William Goldman's witty script. They are lovable rogues who robs banks and trains and inept with it.There is even a Burt Bacharach song in the middle of the movie while Butch is riding a bike.The pairing of Paul Newman as Butch Cassidy and Robert Redford as the Sundance Kid was a eureka moment in cinema history.This is essentially a lighthearted buddy action movie with a prolonged chase sequence. Butch and Sundance try to evade and outsmart the Pinkertons detectives on their trail while they quip: 'Who are these guys.'They end up in Bolivia where they try to go straight, but luck in not on their side. They get robbed and the pair go back to robbing. Known as Bandito Americanos they find that the posse is still chasing them.Far departed from the truth, this offbeat comedy western cemented Newman's stardom and created a star in Redford.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Great Reverse Western With Fantastic Stars,"I miss the late 1960s. Not that I lived during them, not that I look back at the Vietnam War as if it were a good time in American history, not that I'm one of those young buffoons who blames their friendlessness on their possession of an old soul — I miss the late 1960s because of their filmmaking. There was a feeling that anything was possible, that stars we got to know in the earlier years of the decade were suddenly drifting toward the game- changers rather than the drivel wholesome pieces, that Hollywood was suddenly a hip place instead of a soap scrubbed habitation. How movies finally had something to say, whether it be artistically or socially. It's exciting how we could have waltzed into the theater in 1960 to see a ""Pillow Talk"" 2.0, only to come back a few years later and find ourselves with ""Blowup"", ""Easy Rider"", or ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"". No decade has come close to the reinvention seen in the shape-shifting decade.""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is one of the defining films of the time, among the series that entertained us with an easygoing, lo-fi atmosphere rather than a chintzy, big- budgeted one. It's a reverse Western: everything looks as though it could be a part of a later-in-life John Wayne adventure, but the tone is less rugged, more self-deprecating. It's a hybrid of different styles, some reminiscent of Robert Altman, others Robert Benton and Peter Bogdanovich. Only slightly serious, with more than enough comic relief to call itself a — gulp — comedy, it's difficult to put a finger on what ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" really is. Perhaps that was intentional, going out to be an undefinable western romp and coming back a champion. But I suppose its breeziness is part of its charm. Without a care in the world, the actions of the titular characters are unpredictable and wandering, as though it all were improvised. So thank God Paul Newman and Robert Redford have enough charisma to keep us from snoozing as if we were being faced with a laborious spaghetti western.Newman is Butch Cassidy, Redford is the Sundance Kid; as the Old West's most formidable train robbers, they are said to be legends — just don't expect them to wear the term like a five-year-old dons a Superman cape. They view their actions as time wasters, as a way to have some fun on a boring Sunday afternoon. They don't like to kill. They like the thrill that comes with running away from the law. The danger is appealing.But they've been doing the same thing for too long, and they're well aware they aren't going to live to be one-hundred, with so much flak behind their names. They're going to be the victims of a shootout, maybe in a week, a month, a year. So Butch Cassidy, or the Sundance Kid, I don't remember which, proposes they go down to Bolivia — there, they can refresh their thieving ways, and, eventually, live a normal life. In tow is the Sundance Kid's girl, Etta (Katharine Ross), and for the first few months, things are blissful, successful. But when an old enemy makes his way into the area, they realize that escaping from past wrongdoings may only be a temporary solution.When ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" isn't making us laugh, it moves by slowly; because it doesn't have the same mesmerizing quiet of other crime based dramas, like ""Thieves Like Us"" and ""The Thomas Crown Affair"", a moody setback does nothing besides pander by. But when the film is good, it's great. Newman and Redford have better chemistry than some of the most notable screen couples of the time, conversing with such witty ease that we can't help but want to be a part of their crime spree ourselves. One of the best scenes in the film, which finds the duo at the edge of a cliff as the law chases them, is ecstatically funny, an inexperienced Redford complaining that he doesn't know how to swim, worried that he and his crime partner might have to jump. Newman guffaws like an older brother, and, when they do go through with the deed, their rapport, especially as they go downstream, is delivered with effortless comedic energy. Newman and Redford are fantastic together: as the quintessential everymen who happen to be movie stars, they seem destined to headline together. How they only made one other film together (""The Sting"") is mind-boggling — they put the B in bromance. You can forget about Starsky and Hutch, Crockett and Tubbs; Newman and Redford are the real deal.But ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" relies too much on the charisma of its stars. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, considering how excellent it is most of the time, but when it drags, it drags. It's better off as a comedy, and when it decides to go for a serious moment, we're hardly convinced. We want to have fun with our actors, not see them in crisis — the ending, all ""Bonnie and Clyde"" ""tragic"", doesn't fit. We want more adventures. If Clint Eastwood were starring, maybe we'd be okay seeing him go. It would be heroic. But Newman and Redford are much too likable to be too-serious-for-their-own-good anti- heroes, and we don't want to see their brotherly love come to an end.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid,"What can anyone say. These two outlaws were depicted as funny, when in fact they were cold-hearted killers. The camaraderie between them is obvious with Sundance depicted as the 'brains'. Butch's idea of retiring to Bolivia was one of his worst ones. No matter where they went, they were still wanted and they would've had to change their names and appearances to live longer. The t.v show Alias Smith And Jones which was loosely based on Butch and Sundance made Butch and Sundance appear as Sunday School children. Great entertainment if you want a laugh, but otherwise don't waste time",,Anonymous,Biography
A classic western that broke the genre conventions and gave us some of the greatest movie moments in history,"What can be said about 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' that hasn't already been said? We all know about the great performances, the smart witty dialogue and brilliant direction backed up by a magnificent score from the countless positive reviews published by people over the years but I will throw in my 2 cents for what it's worth.For many years, Butch and Sundance has been a movie which has enthralled me. From when I first saw it as a child right up until the present day, it always seems to be able to capture my attention whilst keeping me on the edge of my seat, yet also never fails to make me howl with laughter throughout. And of course the biggest element which allows the film to achieve this is the excellent natural chemistry between leads Newman and Redford. They play off each other perfectly, allowing for great comic moments to shine through and a sense of underlying tension between the brotherly love that they possess for each other.I have to admit, the very first time I saw the opening ten or so minutes of the film, I wasn't interested. And those ten minutes are crucial to a child to capture their attention. I saw it as too slow and I hadn't a clue what was happening or why. But I'm so glad I stuck with it because pretty soon I was near crying with laughter at times and could begin to understand what the pacing of the film was trying to achieve.Don't get me wrong, Butch and Sundance is by no way a flat out comedy – it's just that the leads play off each other magnificently with absolution timing perfection performing from a genius script that allows the actors to play the lines in any number of ways yet, no matter how it was directed or performed, was always going to shine through as a very comic, intimate adventure odyssey of the best bad guys the west ever saw. No wonder it won the Screen writing Academy Award for 1969.The tension packed desert scenes, the sprawling cinematography and lush colours, the marvellous lead and supporting performance, the fast paced editing, the exacting art direction and costumes, they all add up to make Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid one of the greatest films ever a classic that will last for all time to be enjoyed by generations to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"life is beautiful, but it gets you in the end","So much more than just a great western (although that is a big thing in itself) I see this as a sort of fable about how, in spite of all your best efforts, life catches up with you and destroys you. Apparently Robert Redford didn't want the famous 'Raindrops' scene in the picture; I guess that was understandable beforehand, it's true that it's not a very 'Western' scene; but in fact that is precisely the point, and this scene the key scene in the film. It establishes that the characters are not traditional heroes who just want to vanquish the other guy no matter what the cost, but human beings in search of joy who fight and rob - almost apologetically - only because they don't know a better way.Sexy, engaging, witty, exciting and moving, everything about it is just about perfect.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A fun film, and refreshing take on a Western","Gorgeous scenery, big stars in Paul Newman and Robert Redford, and a different take on the Western genre all add up to an enjoyable film. I liked how the pair weren't mythologized and didn't have all the answers, which humanizes them. Between the mistakes they make (like using an excessive amount of dynamite to blow a safe) and their banter (""Think ya used enough dynamite there, Butch?""), there is quite a bit of comedic value from beginning to end. As they're pursued by a posse clearly smarter and tougher than they are through terrain they think can't leave tracks, Butch Cassidy repeatedly asks ""Who are those guys?"" and I thought it was great that the megastars in the film play vulnerable characters on the run for so long. On top of that Butch Cassidy (Newman) admits he's never shot a man, and the Sundance Kid (Redford) admits he doesn't know how to swim. I don't think I've seen Redford give a better performance either. One thing that didn't work for me was the soundtrack from Burt Bacharach. While I think it was meant to go with the modern take on the Western, the ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head"" tune played while Newman clowns around on a bike was shockingly bad to me. Katharine Ross is mostly wasted in the role of the lover the two seem to share, as not much is made with her character. Overall though, a fun film, and a good one for people who are less into traditional Westerns.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Gem,"Butch Cassidy is an all-around excellent film! Obviously, the casting was perfect, and Redford and Newman really played off each other well. The narrative alone, is just a great story in itself, as we're kind of exploring what American legend tells us was a sort of Robin Hood of the wild West. The cinematography is great throughout, and there are many nice wide, and long shots taken to capture some of the rustic and wild lands of the US Rocky Mountain region. Also, there are some awesome color schemes at the beginning and end of the film that capture the rustic feel for the times and places the adventure goes to. Additionally, there is a great soundtrack and original musical score to go along with the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Exciting Film that keeps you guessing,I didn't expect to be so enthralled with excitement in this film. The title of this film doesn't make it quite clear what you are supposed to be expecting out of it. I was very surprised to see that this film was a thriller and one that kept me guessing in fact. The cinematography in addition to the quick edits made in the editing process after shooting only helped to keep my interest throughout. The sound also helped to intensify the tense moments when you weren't too sure whether the main characters were going to make it. I would recommenced this film to anyone who is looking for a great movie that will keep you guessing and an ending that you will not expect!,7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Newman & Redford.,"Paul Newman & Robert Redford play Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid in director George Roy Hill's take on the historical pair of western outlaws who amiably(!) rob banks and trains with their hole-in-the-wall-gang, who soon find themselves wanted men who must flee across the west, taking refuge where they can, and especially with their lady friend Etta Place(Katherine Ross) before they make that fateful trip to Bolivia...Though Paul Newman & Robert Redford are undeniably appealing as the title characters, and the hit song, ""Raindrops keep falling on my head"" is wonderful, film itself is far too protracted and tedious to succeed; it just didn't hold my interest, though both ""Unsolved Mysteries"" & ""In Search Of..."" did excellent jobs focusing on Butch, and whether or not he survived that Bolivian gunfight(no word on Sundance). I'd much rather watch those accounts than this film...",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Western with Wit,"Although the score makes me want to stab a sharp #2 pencil deep into my ear, the film ultimately justifies its classic status with enthralling photography, endearing characters, fairly good pacing, and - above all - a good-natured sense of humor.The opening scene, in all its sepia-toned glory, presents an inspired introduction to the two lead characters.  Butch Cassidy, wry and easy-going, tries to end a dispute between Sundance, the stoic, and an unseen antagonist.  After that, the film takes a dubious turn with the introduction of the love interest, played by Katharine Ross in an exceedingly bland performance.  In fact, I would have gladly forsaken historical accuracy in favor of eliminating her character entirely.The thrill of the hunt (or rather, the hunted) drives the first half of the film.  Seen only from afar, the ""Superposse"" gives off an aura of mythical strength,  disciplined perseverance, and unparalleled skill.  This epic chase escalates to the brink of fever pitch when Butch and Sundance abruptly flee to South America (again, realism is a curse).The pacing of the film stalls a bit at this point due to a tedious, unnecessary montage sequence.  The story regains its former humorous and thrilling style thereafter, except for an inane robbery/self-congratulatory dinner progression complete with cheesy late 60's bubble-gum vocal jazz (stab stab stab).  The final scene is very well executed even though the Bolivian army is not nearly as interesting or as diabolical as the ""Superposse.""The secondary and peripheral characters amuse and entertain throughout (Woodcock, Logan, The Bicycle Salesman, Percy Garris, et al).  I particularly enjoyed Sheriff Bledsoe's frantic and impulsive rambling (""You're gonna die bloody, and all you can do is choose where"").Definitely catch this one if you have the chance.",,Anonymous,Biography

Redford And Newman,"This film directed by George Roy Hill and written by William Goldman in 1969 is a true classic western. Robert Redford as the Sundance Kid, and Paul Newman as Butch Cassidy are wonderful together. In their first film together, they play the roles of outlaws who make a living robbing trains. After a relentless posse is formed to track them down, Butch and Sundance are constantly on the run eventually flushed to Bolivia where they attempt to continue their wistful ways. The cinematography is breathtaking at times although i thought the scenes from Bolivia were somewhat poor. This box-office hit won two Oscars, one by David Goldman for his script writing and the other by Burt Bacarach and Hal David for the movies theme song ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"". Katherine Ross also plays the part of Sundances beautiful girlfriend Etta Pace. If you are a Newman and Redford fan this is a must see!

Great classic,"Sure, the guys here are anti-heroes, but other than that they have the same laidback, wisecracking charm as many heroes who've come ever since. The influence of this comic western is undeniable, particularly in Italy, whose producers made dozens of jokey westerns after the release of this one.Looking back on this film now, I actually think it's quite a slight movie in terms of plot and narrative depth. I like the use of sepia photographs to evoke the setting, but the montage sequences don't really work all that well (although they are included out of necessity, as the producers didn't have permission to shoot on the elaborate sets required). The film gets by thanks to the seemingly effortless performances of Paul Newman and Robert Redford, who have plenty of chemistry together, so much so that the screen is awash with it from beginning to end. Yes, Katharine Ross feels extraneous, and the narrative is slightly repetitive at times, but there are many touches here that make this a well-loved movie: THAT song, and THAT ending.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

I don't love it but I've grown to like it,"""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" tells the mostly true story of a pair of notorious outlaws on the lam. The film won four Oscars and is now regarded as a cinema classic. However, for me, it took a few viewings before I really warmed up to it.The movie is anything but a typical western. For one thing, part of the story takes place in Bolivia, of all locations. There's also more comedy than is usual for a western. Lastly, the Burt Bacharach score defies convention. Some of these quirks set the film apart in a good way while the effect of others is debatable. Personally, I feel that the script struggles a bit with tone and I also find that Bacharach's music is ill-suited for a western.However, it's tough to fault the actors. Newman and Redford have good chemistry together, making this a touchstone for countless buddy comedies to come. Katharine Ross has a more limited role but she performs well nonetheless. There are also some memorable performances in smaller roles, including Strother Martin as a 'colourful' mining company employee.I'm not a big fan of William Goldman's script, despite the fact that it won an Oscar. There are indeed some memorable scenes and dialogue but there's also some material that isn't particularly memorable. The script is also a bit too jokey to be taken very seriously when it tries to be serious. That being said, the climactic showdown does show a deft combination of action, humour & drama.As for the direction, George Roy Hill's Oscar-nominated work is indeed above average. However, I find Conrad Hall's cinematography to be hit or miss. At times, he & Hill went for (and achieved) a washed out look which I didn't care for at all. The Burt Bacharach score, which won an Oscar (plus another for the song ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head""), doesn't particularly appeal to me either. Perhaps it's the juxtaposition of then-contemporary music with the western background that is unpalatable to me.Nevertheless, despite these complaints the film is still enjoyable. It's undeniably required viewing for movie buffs, though I would caution that the merits of its eccentricities are open to debate.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Influential and entertaining,"Despite a few issues, the movie coasts along on the charms of it's iconic duo.We have seen these buddy movies before. Pairing up two characters with opposite temperaments together. In this movie Paul Newman is the easy going and talkative gang leader and Robert Redford is the laconic dead shot. This pairing works wonders. And their interactions easily form the best part of the movie.In the first half of the movie we see them both fleeing from a posse that attempts to pursue them. The movie successfully creates a feeling of dread while hardly showing anything but the outlines of the pursuers from afar. There is a note of impending doom in the air that the movie captures so successfully in this part.But don't worry it's not all serious. In fact it's hardly. There are jokes a plenty. This movie will have you smiling from ear to ear. This is a basically a road trip movie in guise of a western. There are some inspired choices by the director, like the sepia filtered opening, a montage of photos instead of exposition, and of course the iconic ending shot.I have a few issues with this movie. The third act seeps with aimlessness and the movie is not sure what to do with it's characters. Also the Katherine Ross character is really underdeveloped.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Beauty saloon bandits out for easy laughs,"In the old west two train robber fight hard to keep themselves one step head of the law -and each other!A smart alec comedy with enough white teeth and laughs for the large audience not to care too much about the central crime theme or the innocents on the receiving end.People seem tickled by the chemistry between stars Paul ""I don't like being a famous actor"" Newman and Robert ""being good looking ruined my life"" Redford, but it seems more competition as to who gets the last-laugh or who gets the best of the light. Bland, but good looking, Katherine Ross is thrown in to give the thing a bit of heterosexuality.What I don't understand is why films that deal frankly with real criminals, and are exclusively for adults (re Martin Scorsese), are attacked while people that deal with real criminals for family audiences are praised. I guess it as all about how the ""give me the money or I'll kill you"" is put or whether it is put by someone with a healthy dollop of charisma.To sugar the pill even more we have Raindrops Keeping Falling on your head - which shows that they stopped films to show pop videos even in the late 1960's! Burt Bacharach and Hal David claimed an Oscar for it.Butch Cassidy was huge box office and why not? Large budget, good script and good looking stars on peak form. But, the word ""comedy"" is like one of those circus tent dresses that fat women wear - it hides the sins underneath. I guess it proves that if you make a film that is silly (in relationship to the real story is claims to mirror) and unrealistic you cannot be attacked for it.Maybe I think too much - maybe I should be like this film's lap-it-up audience - just switch of my brain and treat it like simple entertainment.

They Fought The Law And The Law ...,"Two American bank robbers head for Bolivia to evade capture, in this George Roy Hill directed Western, based on real-life events. I have never understood the appeal of this film. Its plot is boring for the most part, although it does pick up in the second half.Maybe Butch (Paul Newman) and the ""Kid"" (Robert Redford) charm viewers with their roguish and outlaw attitudes and behavior, so that they, in effect, become the story. Maybe the appeal is their spirit of teamwork. Or maybe it's because the two are so photogenic. In any event, the plot's slow pace could have been improved if the film had been only about seventy or eighty minutes. As is, it's stretched out to 110 minutes with what seems to me to be lots of filler, especially in the first half.The color cinematography is dark, so dark I could hardly see the images at times. So much of the plot happens at night. The scenery might have been beautiful ... if I could have seen it.

"Esto es un robo, las manos arriba!","Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is directed by George Roy Hill and written by William Goldman. It stars Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Katharine Ross and Strother Martin. A Panavision/De Luxe production with music by Burt Bacharach and cinematography by Conrad Hall.Not exactly a hit with the critics of the time, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid had no such problems at the box office or with longevity of popularity. It is still today one of the few Western films that none Western fans enjoy immensely. Much of this can be attributed to the wonderful buddy buddy chemistry between Newman and Redford, and of course the general blending of ragamuffin drama with cheeky chappy comedy.The casting as finished was not exactly set in stone, Newman was always in but was originally going to play the part of Sundance. McQueen was pencilled in for Cassidy, as was Lemmon while Beatty was mooted as well, but eventually a chance was taken on Redford and Newman switched to the role of Cassidy. On such things can a movie be made or broken, as it turned out it was the ace in the pack as infamously legendary characters were brought vividly to life.Only based on the basic real life facts of the Hole-in-the-Wall gang led by Butch Cassidy, the film follows the simple formula of two lovable rogue entrepreneurs being chased by a Pinkerton posse whilst robbing their way to a new life in Bolivia. A gorgeous sepia opening sets the standard for the visual treats to follow, with over a quarter of the film being an extended chase sequence through the landscapes. As Hill and Goldman (Academy Award Best Story/Screenplay) provide the tension in the sequences, Conrad Hall (Academy Award Best Cinematography) brings clarity of beauty that's blended with dust strewn sweat.The music by Burt Bacharach (Academy Award Best Music) has not always gone down well with critics and fans alike, especially the pivotal ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head"" (song by country singer B.J. Thomas). But in the context of the scenes, and the changing of the West (even the Western movie in fact), the music mostly works. Yes, ""Raindrops"" is a touch corny in essence, but the accompanying sequences as the bicycle replaces the horse for a major metaphor - and the warmth of the Etta Place (Ross a little bland) and Cassidy friendship is born out - it's hardly a film killer. In fact it's a daring move by the makers.Hugely influential on Westerns that would follow and spawning further tales of the exploits of Butch and Sundance, Hill's movie has well and truly earned its much loved reputation. With the constant by-play between Redford and Newman always engaging (who are those guys?), a number of iconic scenes firmly ensconced in movie folklore, and technical smarts to cherish, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid never takes its foot of the pedal or its grip on your heart. Because as the freeze frame sepia ending passes muster as a blaze of glory, it's indeed true that Hill, Hall, Goldman, Newman and Redford have made a true Western classic. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful chemistry,"Follows the exploits of two career outlaws, hurtling along toward their fate in an America that celebrates and destroys them all at once.

Brilliant Western,"This is a fantastic western, starring two great actors Paul Newman and Robert Redford, complimented by a great performance by Katherine Ross. The highlight of the film for me was a fantastic chase sequence where Butch and Sundance are being hunted down by a relentess posse of men. The banter between the two leads is fantastic, the only minus point I would give this picture is the music, it was just odd, and didn't seem to fit the film, especially Raindrops keep falling on my head, ugh! Apart from that...an excellent film and one of my favourite westerns ***8/10***",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
charming cool fun duo,"Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) is the leader of the Hole in the Wall Gang. His latest idea is to go to Bolivia with its supposed riches. The Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) is the quick draw of the group and his girl is Etta Place (Katharine Ross). The gang hits the Flyer train. The gang hits the Flyer again and they get ambushed. They are hounded by a posse of the best hired by the head of Union Pacific Railroad. They decide to go on the run with Etta and end up in rural Bolivia.This is sometimes funny but most of all, this is cool. Newman and Redford are playing this with a nudge and a wink. They're just having fun together. And the star power doesn't shine any brighter. The best scenes are always when the two are arguing. These guys just have great chemistry.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Cassidy vs Cassidy, Curry vs Curry","Fun naming trivia: Butch Cassidy, played by Paul Newman, has a fight with Kid Curry (Harvey Logan), played by Ted Cassidy. ""Kid Curry"" is later used as the name of one of the similar heroes in ""Alias Smith & Jones"", ironically played by Ben Murphy, the Paul Newman look- alike! Cassidy fights Cassidy, Curry fights someone who looks like the other Curry...This is a very good movie, although not perfect. The story about the two charming outlaws, with more or less truth behind it, is pretty good, although a bit over the top sometimes. The ambition to tell the story about the real outlaws is undone more than once by over- simplifications and dramatic effects. Fortunately, the movie has qualities beyond that.I think that the fine performances by Redford and Newman is what holds it together. That, plus the good photography, and the fact that the script most likely was very original at the time. Later, the ""Alias Smith & Jones"" TV series shows what would have happened if they had been granted amnesty, which they are denied in the movie, resulting in a lighter version of the story.So, if you want something less bloody than ""Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid"", get ""Alias Smith & Jones"". If, on the other hand, you like ""Alias Smith & Jones"", this is the original that you can't miss!A classic, definitely.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The Ultimate in ""Group Think"" Cinema Myth","I saw this when it came out, at the theater, as a high school kid. Even then it was boring. Nothing like The Sting. I was happy to be on a date and just glad to be out with my boyfriend, so I have good memories of that night, but the movie was the least of them.This movie did fit the zeitgeist of the time perfectly (anti-heroes = counterculture). After all, this was the year of Easy Rider, Midnight Cowboy, The Wild Bunch, and many others in this style, but BC&SK was by far the worst of them. It was the first Western which incorporated pop culture and music. It was the ""thing"" to see it on a date. It hit pop culture like a canon. I remember people dressing up like the characters of Redford, Newman, and Ross and getting photographs in sepia enlargements for proud display. Lines from the movie were oft repeated, esp perhaps the movie first, ""Oh...sh....it!"". Several TV shows were spawned (all cheesy, too). Fashion was influenced. Every teenage girl wanted to be Katerine Ross (I did and I don't see why, now). ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head"", was a huge pop hit, and stands up well today.And so this movie was all about the music. I don't think popular music had ever been used in a Western before, which explained much of its appeal. The music video, to the vocal pop song, ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head"", introduced the relationship between Cassidy, the Kid, and Elle, and was gorgeously filmed. But unlike Easy Rider, this soundtrack then moved from the good to total cheese, with a 60s ""doobie doobie dooo..."" vocal interlude, during a *chase* scene, of all things! While they were forgivable in commercials and Alfa Romeo gorgeous girl scarf trailing Italian movie scenes, they were not here. I feel a lot of nostalgia when I hear 60s ""doobie doobie dooo...""s, but they are still just cheesy remnants of that time. The rest of the Bacharach/David score was good, but nothing memorable. I'll take majestic Western movie music over this Western soundtrack, anytime, which better describes the sweeping majesty of Western locations. The music rarely induced any kind of excitement or suspense, either. Doobie doobie doooooooo...The script was terrible, with Newman and Redford taking up the slack with their so-called chemistry and renowned sex appeal. I can't believe William Goldman, a notable novelist and screenwriter (The Princess Bride, Marathon Man, All the President's Men, and many more) penned this AND won an Oscar for it (over Midnight Cowboy, etc????). It was an innovative script only in that the outlaws escaped and had more adventures after, which gave the movie an excuse to last another hour.It lost my interest after the music video, however, and went seriously begging for plot through to the end. Bad direction and editing was to blame here. There was too much ""filler"", like still photos panned over too long, instead of the real scenes, which looked like they would have been far more interesting. Likewise, the extended chase scenes quickly lost their charm, as they were not designed well and had none of the elements that we expect from chase scenes. Of course, only so much you can do with a horse chase. Other than that, the well filmed (although too many strange telephoto shots) western country at least gave us something of value to watch and won an Oscar (they weren't THAT great, if you compare any John Ford Western, or the love song to NYC that Midnight Cowboy's cinematography was, or even Easy Rider's America).In the end, this is a movie which relies on music, the pairing of Redford and Newman, in their prime, cute banter, and MTV slickness, but lacks in any substance whatsoever. To call it ""great cinema"" is a real disservice to truly great cinema. After the music video bike scene, it is all downhill and if this movie was released today, it would be a complete flop. Virtually nothing happens in the last 3/4 and no one would now put up with that.I hate to offend so many people, but I think the high ratings are from those who accept pop culture's myths without thinking for themselves, or who haven't seen the movie since its release and since they grew up, now without the zillions of $$ of promotion, which made the myth before the myth was even seen. The ultimate in ""group think"". You just cannot watch this NOW and write a favorable review, unless you specify the first third. If you were alive when it came out, watch it again to see the truth. If you weren't, don't bother, you will never get the time back. Funny, I almost didn't watch it today, as I always thought of it as rather boring, and wondered what didn't I get that everyone else seemed to. I did and it was.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Overall a fantastic scoundrel flick,"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), George Roy Hill is a fantastically entertaining film about the notorious robbers as they escape the closely pursuing lawmen on their tail. This movie rally shines in both the acting and writing departments at points although seems to falter here and there. I really liked these characters quite quickly into the film and Paul Newman, Robert Redford, and the rest of the supporting cast do an excellent job. The choice to shoot many of the scenes in real locations also helped greatly in adding to the authenticity of the shots and I've always appreciated when films and filmmakers step away from the sets. Even though I though the movie's quality was a little wishy-washy at points I still really enjoyed it and would certainly view it again at some point.",,Anonymous,Biography

The ""pure entertainment"" which lies at the heart of this masterpiece is also at the core of why BC&SK is historically an extremely important motion picture.

Newman & Redford are basically a super cute couple: banter, longing smiles, light-hearted bickering, unending love. Best of all, there's never a lame save-the-cat moment to make us root for them.

"I'm in with the outlaws, I go where the outlaws go.","Movies have been guilty of romanticising the lives of ruthless criminals for decades, and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is perhaps the most blatant example, the film portraying the infamous outlaws as loveable rogues -- best buds who are simply enjoying their chosen vocation: holding up banks and sticking up trains (or is it 'sticking up banks' and 'holding up trains'?).While I generally prefer films based on historical figures to be as factually accurate as possible, and get narked should they stray from the truth, I cannot help but warm to this revisionist western's dubious duo: as played by Paul Newman and Robert Redford, the affable anti-heroes share a bond that is hard to resist, engaging in breezy conversation as they go about their business, charming even the most pernickety viewer (i.e., me!) into submission in the process.Writer William Goldman and director George Roy Hill clearly intend for their audience to side with Butch and Sundance, and for the most part, that is precisely what happens - at least until the showdown against the Bolivian army in the final act, when the outlaws gun down numerous soldiers while trying to flee. Up until this moment, the pair had only killed a vicious gang of payroll bandits, but it's much harder to forgive the shooting of men who are trying to uphold the law.The ending sees the daring partners in crime making a final bid for freedom despite being vastly outnumbered. In keeping with the general light-hearted nature of the film, we don't see the men cut down in a hail of bullets and blood (as in Bonnie and Clyde and The Wild Bunch); instead, they are caught freeze-frame as they leg it, leaving just a glimmer of hope that they somehow survived (to date, no-one has been able to say for sure that Butch and Sundance died that day in Bolivia).7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for Burt Bacharach's 'Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head', sung by B.J. Thomas -- anachronistic, perhaps, but still a timeless classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Newman and Redford in arguably the first modern Western,"Released is 1969 and directed by George Roy Hill, ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford as the eponymous outlaws and key members of the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang headquartered near Dubois, Wyoming. After robbing one train too many, the head of Union Pacific hires a six-man team of skilled lawmen to apprehend the duo and so they flee to Bolivia with Sundance's lover & schoolteacher, Etta (Katharine Ross). Strother Martin, Ted Cassidy, Jeff Corey and Cloris Leachman are featured in peripheral roles.The gist of the story is historically accurate, with the movie starting in the late 1890s and ending with the outlaws' deaths in November, 1908, which means the picture encompasses about 9-10 years, although it seems more like a couple of years. In any case, this was a state-of-the-art Western when it was released and a huge success at the box office. The production quality, tone and theme are comparable to 1967's ""Bonnie and Clyde."" It's a very 'modern' Western, arguably the first (although a good case could be made for 1967's ""Hombre""), and therefore holds up well today, hardly seeming dated; that is, disregarding ""Rain Drops Keep Falling on My Head,"" which plays during an interlude at the end of the first act. In spirit, the movie inspired future great modern Westerns like ""The Missouri Breaks"" (1976), ""The Long Riders"" (1980) and ""Unforgiven"" (1992), all superlative Westerns that don't seem to age as the decades pass.While Redford was already appearing in significant movies, this is the one that shot him to stardom and he went on to star in notable Westerns like ""Tell Them Willie Boy is Here"" (1969), ""Jeremiah Johnson"" (1972) and the great ""The Electric Horseman"" (1979), the latter taking place in the modern day, of course. As for Newman, it's hard to believe he's the same actor that starred in the aforementioned ""Hombre,"" as his character couldn't be any more different as Butch Cassidy, a fun-loving, witty train robber (in ""Hombre"" he's the opposite: a laconic, mirthless white man raised by Apaches).Although the tone is similar to ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" I don't think it's on the level of that film. I also don't understand the gushing it often receives. Yes, it's good, but at the end of the day, it's about two thugs who were on a collision course with premature death due to their own folly. Newman and Redford are entertaining as the pair, but it's hard to sympathize with fools who stubbornly insist on carrying on their idiotic thuggery even though they have the awesome opportunity to start a new life.There are two sequels worth checking out: ""Wanted: The Sundance Woman,"" a 1976 TV movie starring Katherine Ross, which shows what happens to Etta after leaving the duo for America; and, especially, ""Blackthorn,"" a 2011 release starring Sam Shepherd as Butch Cassidy in his old age in Bolivia, which presupposes that he somehow survived the ending of this movie.The film runs 110 minutes and was shot in Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona and California. The script was written by William Goldman.GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The most likable criminal couple in film history,"How is it possible that when people hear the word 'western' they immediately think of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid? Well, there are exactly THAT many reasons for this interesting phenomena.Firstly, the stunning directing by George Robert Hill makes it look like an exactly archetypal movie in this specific category. It easily became a smash hit at the box-office in the United States in 1969 and went on to create a major fan base all over the world.Secondly, it offers a spellbinding storyline provided by the great William Goldman. It's packed with everything that can be connected with this most American of all genres: genuine characters, grand wild west feeling, gunfights, train robberies, pretty dames, dangerous enemies, gangs, chases, great adventures, a little romance, a little comedy, etc. Additionally, all the clever dialogues make the movie much more pleasurable and engaging.Thirdly, the cinematography is really incredible, offering the most captivating views of Western American and Bolivian landscapes, which the viewer is able to admire right from the beginning up till the very end. Also, the fantastic shifts in takes from sepia to color in some of the most climatic scenes create a perfect atmosphere.Fourthly, I believe that I didn't mention the two stars, the most memorable couple of gunslingers, train robbers and lawbreakers that ever roamed through the vast American desserts – Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford). Based on a real-life pair of criminals, their story is partly true and partly imagined. On the run from the law, the boys decide to hide in Bolivia and start a new career there. Along comes Etta Place (Katharine Ross), Kid's girlfriend. They try to learn Spanish in order to be able to rob banks, but what comes out of this farce looks more like a comedy than serious business. After a series of successes and some misfortunes, they are finally wanted all over the country, like they were in their homeland. In the most gripping, and unforgettable final scene they have to fight with tens of policemen and even though the viewers knows that they are criminal and, thus, should be caught or killed, the way they are portrayed makes it easy to admire those two up-to-no-good characters.Surprisingly, the scene, which stayed in my memory for the longest time, wasn't this one or any other of the fast-action sort – it was the one when Butch was riding on a bike with Etta (accompanied by a beautiful song 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head'), like they were two innocent kids, strolling around farms, as if nothing really mattered.All of those factors make this movie look special. I won't be original when I say that this is probably one of my favorite western of them all, but that's the truth. No one can deny that Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kind will go down in history as one of the finest, most entertaining, and most achieved movies ever.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Still a great popcorn night type movie,"It's two sexy men rolling in the dirt, robbing banks and cracking jokes. They look good, have money and make you laugh - can't ask for anything more from a woman's point of view from a movie. When these two great actors pair up, magic explodes on the screen. It's not necessarily about the plot. Sometimes its just about how two actors envision a role and then act it out. The chemistry is evident and you can feel the heat. I love Newman and Redford. Their acting reminds you of how good movies used to be when you could go to the movies and just laugh. And to see two men loving the same woman. That was a treat. One took care of her heart and the other took care of her playful side and neither of the men where jealous of one another. A movie where the woman gets two guys - lovely. And Ross was not a professional male entertainer but a school teacher. She wasn't a damsel in distress, she just wanted a fuller life and to enjoy it. I thought it was a great movie and it will always be a classic for me. The soundtrack was amazing because it was simple, playful and entertaining.",,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful,"Watching Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid for the first time since the 1970s I can't help thinking how groundbreaking it was back then. A true story, a western with a heart but packed with action, but which also doesn't take itself too seriously, it was also a key 'buddie' movie that spawned many imitations, and was one of the first American western which tried to emulate the success and style of the spaghetti westerns, all the rage at the time. It's funny, engaging, with great performances from Newman and Redford, and though the style is now sometimes feels very much of its time, i.e. The easy going 70s. It's a great watch but I did think that Burt Bacharach's music seemed just a tad dated and somewhat out of place at times, but that doesn't really detract from what is still a great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The chemistry between the lead actors doesn't wholly justify the great reputation of the film,"In ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" the lead characters are criminals, but they don't see themselves that way. What's more, also the sympathy of the spectators of the movie lies with them. In effect they are more rebels and rascals than criminals. Their robbery's seem to be more inspired by the thrill than by a lust for money. Nearly 50 years later Robert Redford would play a comparable (but much older) character in ""The old man & the gun"" (2018, David Lowery). Also note the reluctance with which Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid use violence. When they use dynamite in a train robbery they are anxious to check that they haven't killed a train employee in the proces. Their first kill is when employed at ""the other side of the table"" as security officers.""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid"" has a big reputation. The subject of the film (train robberies) is as old as film itself (""The great train robbery"", 1903, Edwin Porter being one of the first experimental shorts). The chemistry between Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance kid (Robert Redford) is the unique selling point if this film. This selling point however is not enough to justify the reputation of the film.The film also has its flaws.In the first place are the US and the Bolivian parts of the movie too much alike.In the second place is the movie too dependant on some comic moments. I am referring to the bicycle ride of Butch Cassidy and the girl friend of the Sundance kid (Katharina Ross). Another omic element is the first bank robbery in Bolivia, reading the Spanish commands from a note.Most irritating is however the hunt-scene that is way too long. The landscape scenery is very beautiful, but it almost looks like this is the only reason that some scenes are not deleted.The ending almost seems a copy from the famous ending of ""Bonnie and Clyde"" (1967, Arthur Penn).",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing Chemistry from two of the best.,"When you see a film like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid a sad thought springs to mind and that is ""Isn't age a horrible thing "" I have just watched Road to Perdition which stars Paul Newman and when you see how fantastic he looks in This film to how old he looks in the latter it is a terrible shame . Redford and Newman are a fantastic double act and look as good as anybody ever has in cinema in this movie. I wouldn't say the film is fantastic in itself but what does make it a classic is the cinematography , the funny script (not the actual story) and the two lead actors. It does make me wonder why in their later years Robert Redford and Paul Newman have kept their film appearances down to a minimum and why they haven't done a film together since the 70's. I'm not sure if they fell out but one thing is for sure the chemistry they produced together in this film is a rare thing indeed. 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
No Sundance we didn't put enough dynamite in there !?,"I'm sure we all have one film that we see and ask the question "" what is all the fuss about  !? "" for me BCATSK is that film. It's far beyond my comprehension how this film was so popular with filmgoers and critics. Although I think critics jumped on the band wagon over time in part due to its popularity as I think it was coolly received when initially released . Whatever the case may be its my personal candidate for most over rated film ever !  To start with I didn't find any of its lame dialogue witty or funny. I specially hated the initial scene with Redford and Ross "" keep going teacher lady and Why can't you ever be on time "" also the closing lines between Redford & Newman were also unfunny and corny. My recollection of the trailers for the film gave me the impression this was an action film and I consider it to be a contemporary of films of its time Bonnie & Clyde and The Wild Bunch. Those were truly great films while BCATSD was a pale imitation. The few action scenes in the film were too lightweight and the only memorable moment in the film for me was when Butch & Sundance kill  bandits during a period where they try to go straight and Sundance comments "" well we've gone straight "" When the film tried to get serious and hard edged the producers bailed out badly at the end. Our Hollywood pretty boys  were freeze framed at the conclusion instead of being graphically shot to pieces as was the norm for the time and had they the courage to film it that way it would have given the film some power. I'm sure they would tell you that it was not the intention of the film to go in that direction but this was to be a fun light film. Light yes fun perhaps to those amused by the dialogue but nothing else. I'm sure the Newman Redford combo and chemistry had more to do with the film's success than anything else. It was nicely photographed and had a good score but what is this movie about and what is it saying to us !? The Pinkerton pursuit was overlong and I think in part due to the lack of any real script. I got the impression they wrote it as they went along. I don't think BCATSK was a bad film just a mediocre one that just happened to become an all time classic.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

I've got your six,"Every time I watch ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"", I spend days reading and watching everything that is known about them. Did they die in that town in Bolivia or did they return and live out their lives in anonymity, and what was going on with Etta?It's not that I don't appreciate the movie for what it is, I love it, but I get the same pull of the mystery that must have inspired William Goldman to write the screenplay.It's a movie that has travelled easily across the decades. It's 55-years young. I still find it funny and poignant just as the filmmakers intended.Finding out the known facts doesn't really detract from the movie. The filmmakers captured a sense of the disappearing Old West, but then gave it a totally modern vibe with a catchy soundtrack and songs, but the casting made it. Paul Newman was in early, but they churned through quite a few names before they settled on Robert Redford who looked a lot like Sundance, and brought perfect timing to the role; underreacting is often funnier than overreacting. But it wasn't a comedy; amusing bits of business were dropped when it seemed it was getting too many laughs.However the filmmakers could not have dreamed that their homage to Butch and Sundance would make their names synonymous with male bonding, buddies, best mates, partners; two guys that despite disagreements and different personalities will take a bullet for each other.I'm surprised more shows don't use the formula. You might get away as a loner in a sedate occupation, but for a cop; a fireman; a grunt walking point or as an outlaw on the run from a super posse, you need someone to watch your back, your 6 o'clock. Loners stand less chance. The classic example is the probable end of the real Butch and Sundance when they where trapped in that little room in San Vincente with bullets ricocheting around like a Mixmaster, Butch did the necessary with a bullet for his badly wounded buddy and then one for himself.When you see photos of the real Belle Starr and Calamity Jane, you know that Hollywood took liberties casting beautiful actresses in the parts of those tough-looking, sharp-shooting women, but not so with Etta Place. The real Etta would have turned Stetsons and sombreros everywhere she went. And those posed studio pictures of Butch and the gang, and Sundance with Etta in her beautifully accessorised Edwardian gown could almost be their portfolio shots at Central Casting they look so right for their parts; no wonder Goldman saw a movie in the whole thing.And there it is, the movie is now enmeshed with the real story and although we can see where it embellished the facts or departed from them altogether, it delivered exactly what it stated at the beginning: ""Most of what follows is true"".",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

There are several dialogue heavy scenes that become monotonous to watch, as we are merely waiting for gunfire to break loose.Paul Newman and Robert Redford are absolutely phenomenal in their respective roles here, Newman is charming and convincing as the experienced one, while Redford fits in perfectly as the naive young one that thinks he knows everything. Their unique back and forth was without a doubt the highlight of the film.Well acted fun.

In late 60s Hollywood was edging past the cinema code with brutal and exploiting films and so all the cinematic classics made before 60s were getting updated versions. Now whether they matched the original themes or failed badly is a different thing but the audience was loving all new filmmaking style as there was not much available on Internet like we have today. Western is one of my favourite genre because it provides a break from High Quality, Brain research films and lots of action packed entertainment. In my list i have many favourites from old Hollywood so compared to those cult films Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid is certainly far behind. The film isn't bad at all, it's just that this genre carries a legacy of many cult films so expectations level does not feel matched with just any good film, it has to be very very good or even better than that. This film is about Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid, the leaders of a band of outlaws who are running from a special team formed by railway government whose Money they robbed many times. There is nothing much in the story rather it is a very simple plot with simple ending. There is nothing deep or highly meaningful so all we have to do is just enjoy the show. Robert Redford and Paul Newman's pair creates a certain magical chemistry which is worth watching. Cinematography is top class and deserved the Oscar Award, rest, there is nothing much to praise intentionally. George Roy Hill tries nothing new in the storytelling except for heavy gunfirings and reel typed filming. But still the film never looks bad, it doesn't look anything great either. Overall, a Good Western that can be recommended for Redford and Newman Mania.RATING - 6.5/10*By - #samthebestest",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The worst music ever for a western,"Ok, the movie had its good parts and bad parts.  The good parts are seen in several westerns (ie the final battle, the running from the federales).The bad parts are absolutely ridiculous.  A very good example of my point is the bicycle scene.  Who puts stuff like that in a western?  Also, what were those people thinking with that absolutely horrible music score? Raindrops Falling on My Head?  The Ba Ba song?  What kind of western music is that?If you want a great movie with everything including a remarkable music score, then see The Magnificent Seven!",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
This movie SUCKED,"Good gracious this film was so bad. It was just so bad I can't describe it. It was really, really bad. I was looking forward to this film but it was rubbish. I really did not like it at all.It's all about two cowboys who are criminals who rob a train. Then they get chased a lot by strange lights that we're not even sure are actually chasing them. For all we know they could just be regular cowboys out for a ride (for example to break in a new horse, which is what they did back in days of yore when the film was made) or townsfolk off to a church in a different town. They might do this because their church doesn't cater for their beliefs or maybe for other reasons. there are lots of explanations of what those lights could be. That's how rubbish this film is.All the two cowboys do is get chased and ride bicycles (like they have any spare time if they're getting chased). This film is so boring it's a bad thing to watch it. Watching this film is like getting bad news from your proctologist. Sometimes the two cowboys make trips to Argentina where the film ends with the worst ending I have ever seen. After all that chasing it really bugged me and I can't even tell you about the ending. That makes me mad sometimes.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Use enough dynamite there, Butch?","No better western duo than Paul Newman and Robert Redford. And no better trio than Redford, Newman, and Katherine Ross. Their triangle relationship is beautiful. To me, it represents a wonderful example of the potential of human relationships. No anxiety, no possession, just a free, happy trio. The bicycle scene is one of the greatest scenes in film, and I've always thought so. You either get it or don't. Very little scenes in anything convey a feeling of freedom and happiness the way that one does. The dialog is great/hilarious. So many quotable lines. One of my favorite westerns. Makes me want to become a bank robber...JUST KIDDING HAHA!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of those films that makes you root for the bad guys!,"There were some parts of the movie that made me lose interest in it, but most of the time I had to acknowledge and appreciate how cool and special it was with its entertainment, especially when Newman and Redford were on the run from the law/cavalry. There were some really well done and suspenseful scenes, plus good choices of songs/music and good shots of the landscapes where their adventures, retreats, and heists took place. It had a powerful ending as well and while some might not like it because the picture montages, they were done in a creative way imo. The kind of movies that make you sympathize the most with the bad guys only got bigger and better after this movie!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Perfect in every aspect,"Its amazing how this film have it all!It has comedy,drama,romance,adventure and...its a western!It has a two brilliant actors at the peak of their career.It has a beautiful and talented supporting actress.It has a script that is the best I have ever saw so smart and precise.It has splendid cinematography and a memorable score.It has ""Rain Drops Keep Falling on My Head"" in a wonderful video-clip!The costumes are also totally convincing and the art direction is also great.And the sound...it is amazing how the sound editing conducted one of the most memorable persecution scenes just by the sound of the horses...Not to mention the bullets at the ending...And the direction...You can analyze just by the transition on the USA story to Bolivia using only photographs....Outstanding!!! Summarizing..The Best Movie Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not so much a western as an adventure movie,"First of all I want you to know that I'm not really a fan of westerns. There are a couple of fine ones, like for instance ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (the movies that are commonly known as spaghetti westerns, because they were made by Italians, this time Sergio Leone), but overall this just isn't my kind of movie. But from time to time I like to forget about my dislikes for a certain genre. When I've got the chance of watching a classic movie, no matter which genre, I will not think twice.Butch and Sundance are the leaders of the 'Hole-in-the-Wall Gang', a gang that was called that way because of the way they committed their robberies. But the West is changing and is becoming more civilized - too civilized for criminals. When they have robbed a certain train a time too often, a special posse begins trailing them and is always able to stay right behind them, no matter where or how fast they run. When they finally know to escape after a daring act of bravery or foolishness (it just depends on the way you look at it), they come up with another fine plan: they will move to Bolivia, the land where life as a criminal is still great...The acting in the movie is nice and I wouldn't be able to choose between Robert Redford and Paul Newman if I had to take one for best performance. Both did a very fine job with this movie, but they had some interesting characters to work with of course. Thanks to the story, which in my opinion can't be seen as a western, but more or less as an adventure movie, this movie is still known and famous. It's original and it was probably a very daring concept in the sixties, when most westerns were still about cowboys and Indians chasing and killing each other.Despite the fact that I'm not too much a fan of westerns, I must say that I liked this one. It will never be my favorite movie, but I admit that I've seen a lot worse in the past. That's why I give this movie a 7/10. Especially people who love adventure movies will like this classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Oh, good. For a moment there I thought we were in trouble.","The Academy Awards were all over this film for music and cinematography and the script, but they completely ignored the actors. BAFTA did a little better in recognizing Robert Redford and Katherine Ross. Paul Newman seems to be given short shrift in the film.There is no denying the quality of the direction by George Roy Hill (The Sting, Slap Shot), and the brilliant script by William Goldman, who won an Oscar for this script and for All The President's Men. He also wrote Marathon Man. But direction, scenery, and a great script are nothing if you don't have great actors to deliver the lines.Redford was outstanding, Newman set him up perfectly, and Ross was dazzling. They all delivered the lines better than anyone I could imagine to make a semi-buddy film (can't leave Ross out). They also had great support from a great cast.Raindrops may keep falling on my head, but Newman and Redford rock.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"1st act - meh, 2nd act - awesome!, 3rd act - Boring",This movie was very uneven. The first 30 min were quite slow and romantic. The next 40 min were breathtaking with cat and mouse chase that was superbly directed and shot. And the remaining 50 min were just boring with needless montages and goofy scenes.Worth to watch for the 2nd act but else quite forgettable.,6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Handsome liberal Western,"An American Western which occupies an area between dramatic action and comedy, but not action-comedy. The characters are unconventionally portrayed: they are lean and muscular cowboys but transform into low comedians part way through. But, for sheer entertainment it is superlative. It has handsome central performances from two handsome actors, who have great chemistry.
The cinematography is sumptuous with brilliant use of colour and shade to evoke feeling. The locations are magnificent. The editing, however, impairs the film slightly. The chase by the posse was overlong and the film drops into a ravine by the second act as a result, struggling to recover what it promised.
All in all, though, it has a fabulous musical score, cinematography and screenplay, all elements rewarded by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. It is very watchable stuff.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
What's so great about this?,"I don't often feel a need to review a movie - especially when it's one that I didn't like much. But since this movie is so famous and so highly regarded, and since I found it to be such a mediocre film, I had to voice my opinion. If you're like me, you'll want to skip this movie.After years of putting it off, I finally saw this movie the other day. I could not believe that what I saw is considered a classic and a ""must see"" film. OK, so I know it has some pretty good lines and scenes, and it has some iconic actors, and the screenwriter has a pretty impressive list of films he's done before. But there's a lot more to making a good movie than just having famous people work on it. And in my opinion, this is a very boring movie.Whenever I watch a movie that I consider boring, it's usually because I don't care about the characters or the story, and when that happens, it's the screenwriter's fault. William Goldman wrote one of my favorite movies, the Princess Bride. That had a great story and some really great characters. And for the most part, it was done with relatively unknown actors.This film, however, had some very famous actors and was about some very famous actual historical characters. I love stories about the Old West, and I really should have enjoyed this movie. Instead, it was very hard for me to watch this film. I fast-forwarded through many parts of it just to finally get through it.The ""raindrops"" scene with Newman and Ross on a bicycle was completely out of place. How does a late 1960's pop song have anything at all to do with Butch Cassidy? This scene is horrible. It added absolutely nothing at all to the film. We already know Katharine Ross's character has relationships with both of the title characters. The bicycle scene was totally unnecessary, and I can't imagine why that wasn't cut out of the movie entirely. Even if you watch it on 2X, you'll still waste 5 minutes waiting for the scene to end.There's another scene when they're traveling to Bolivia. This takes forever as well. Do we really need to see the sepia-toned pictures of these actors making their way down to Bolivia? I don't think so. It certainly doesn't have to be as long as it was, either. I hate it when screenwriters don't give the audience enough credit. We all know how far away Bolivia is. We don't need to see 12 minutes of footage to know it took a really long time for them to make it there.Finally, a word about the acting. Newman, Redford and Ross have done some great work in other movies. In this one, though, I'm not sure they were necessary at all. Just about anyone could have done just as well as they did. I didn't see any reason at all that they were needed for this film to work.My advice to you is to skip this movie. It is terribly overrated.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Who Are Those Guys""?","The ""blueprint"" for every buddy movie you've seen in the last 35 years...The recent passing of director George Roy Hill prompted me to revisit this classic.  I checked it out with and without the commentary on a DVD, and it was just fine either way.  Just good old-fashioned American movie making, something you can watch with your kids and not worry about anything too embarrassing cropping up (save for the hot scene where Sundance gets back with Ms. Ross-who never looked better).Nothing too revealing came out of the DVD interviews with Newman and Redford from the early nineties, but it seemed like a nice trip down memory lane for both them and me.   However, Redford did seem to really enjoy the scene where Butch kicked Ted Cassidy (""Lurch"") in a ""very sensitive area""!",,Anonymous,Biography
"The Future's All Yours, You Lousy Bicycle !","Few films,I would say, are as well made as Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid; I might even dare to say it's one of the ten best films ever made and the best western of all time.Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) along with his partner The Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) and his Hole In The Wall Gang, are the rulers of Wymoning and much of the west....or so they were. But now the 1898 west,and world, is no longer wild and has no room for outlaws like Butch and Sundance. Unfortunately, the lawbreaking duo aren't fully aware of this. Nor do they realize this conflict of eras can only end one way.
In a nutshell, one could describe Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid as a commentary on changing times and the ultimate demise of those who live in the past.
The posse led by Joe Lafors and Sir Baltimore represents the new times in a sense. Though we never see their faces, hear their voices, or know all of their names; they are perpetually on the heels of Butch and Sundance unthwartable and incessantly in pursuit.
Another example of this symbolism is when Butch, Sundance and Etta are about to leave for Bolivia, Butch takes a bicycle he recently bought and roles it into the muck shouting ""The future is all yours, you lousy bicycle !"" Although I am not a fan of symbolism, I must admit Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid uses it excellently.Winner of four Academy Awards (Original Screenplay, Song, and Score) as well as being nominated in three other categories-including Best Picture-Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid is exciting, funny, poignant and a masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very good entertainment,"While this film isn't revelatory, it is very good escapist fare. There is a sense of adventure and Butch and Sundance are slick and charismatic. I enjoyed the action scenes and liked the chemistry between stars Redford and Newman. Ms. Ross (The Graduate) also added to the mix in a most satisfactory way. All in all, I felt the film brought to life the legend of Butch and Sundance with the perfect mix of drama, comedy, and action. Recommended, 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Just like the old days""","When the old Hollywood production code was abandoned in 1967 it wasn't just sex, violence and profanity that started appearing on cinema screens. For the first time since the early 1930s you could get away with making criminals the good guys. One of the nicest products of this new era of liberty was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, a Western very much of its time in style and values, and yet one so warmly human and respectful to genre convention you feel it was aching to be made all along.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is first of all a superbly written screenplay. What is striking is how witty it is from start to finish, enough to arguably classify it as a comedy Western. But this is far from being a Blazing Saddles-style spoof. The humour is very natural, and largely serves to make the characters instantly likable. A great example is the early scene in which Butch is challenged by Logan, and Butch uses his intelligence and his sense of humour to overcome his opponent, whereby from then on we admire and route for the guy. Another great aspect of the picture is how the two main characters are opposites who complement each other. The easygoing amiable Butch and the prickly, cynical Sundance are like a gentler version of the brains and brawn dynamic of many criminal duos both real and fictional.It may seem obvious now, but it was only after a lengthy selection process that Paul Newman and Robert Redford were cast as the eponymous heroes. But just like the written characters, this pair have a great rapport and complementary styles. Newman has such presence and charisma that, even though his character actually makes a lot of bad judgements throughout the picture, he still has the air of man people will look up to and follow. Redford handles the difficult balance of bringing out Sundance's curmudgeonly manner but giving us the impression that it's all a front and he is a nice guy deep down. Above all they both make their performances look effortless, so that although these are obviously heavily idealised portrayals of the real historical figures, we believe in them as genuine people.This was the picture in which ace director George Roy Hill really hit his stride. He often uses camera set-ups that may seem against cinematic convention but help to focus us purely on what is important. Take the sepia-toned sequence after the opening credits. We start with a very odd shot of Paul Newman walking through a town which, rather than show him in a more normal wide-shot showing off the whole street, frames him in mid-close-up. We then get a lengthy shot of Redford framed similarly whilst the gambler he is talking to has his back to us. What these shots do is draw us in completely on these two characters for their introduction scene, without distracting us with the faces of anyone who is inconsequential to the story. However, after these opening few shots we move to the wider group shots and landscapes that let us know we are in familiar Western territory. There are some other neat touches from Hill in the chase scenes that form the climax of the first half of the picture. He keeps the pursuing lawmen in long-shot, never allowing us to get a proper glimpse of them, which makes them a depersonalised presence, and puts us constantly in the place of heroes. Also rather than cutting back and forth as many chase sequences do, he has several set-ups in which both hunter and hunted are together in the same shot (very difficult to organise over such great distances), which gives a very realistic sense of the pursuit.The icing on the cake is surely the music. Not just the Burt Bacharach tunes, at turns achingly sad or wonderfully jaunty, but the way they are used. The central montage of sepia photos has a beautiful sense of nostalgia to it, and the fact that these ""good times"" are presented in a way that is somewhat distant and abstract gives them a tone of poignancy when compared to the bad times that are to come in Bolivia. These good old days are dead and gone, the montage seems to say. Of course Raindrops Keep Fallin' on my Head is a tad anachronistic but it suits the tone of the bike ride sequence perfectly. Touches like this, the occasional nods to the nouvelle vague and the modern-sounding score, along with the carefree ethos, make Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid very much a movie of its time. And yet, it does not have the pretentiousness or downright weirdness of so many late-60s cinema, and with its good-natured charm it is in fact one of the most accessible and enduring pieces of its era.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
They can't read or write but they look good,"This is the translated tagline of a minor German movie but it fits well here. The story reminds much of Bonnie & Clyde but doesn't feel as realistic as the latter. Both leads are way too elegant and conspicuous to do the job of a bank robber. And in Bolivia every person on the street would remember these 2 guys for years just having them seen taking a coffee. I didn't laugh much and was sometimes even bored. Both actors who try hard to appear cool don't really succeed. If you are looking for a good Western of the late 60s don't look for Hollywood films except the THE WILD BUNCH)! OK, they are really handsome and there is this tune ""Raindrops are falling on my head"" that stayed in my ear for weeks.7 / 10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Just wonderful!,"Howdy there!I knew this was a classic and I wanted to watch it for a long time, but I definitely didn't expect it to be like this: slow, but not boring, funny and folish, but in a right manner, serious but not too serious and definitely with a wonderful chemistry and performances of two legends. I am a person that often gets distracted during the movies, I like to make a pause, sometimes even close my eyes and sleep for couple of minutes as often movies just tire me. But not this one although I acknowledge that is was pretty slow or I at least felt like that. Very good story, wonderful script and dialogues, beautiful scenery and again, great chemistry beetween two main actors. The contrast beetween the two is really fun and they often acknowledge it in the movie and have fun with it: Butch is very smart and Kid is great with guns; the first likes to talk, while the other is silent most of the time ...Overall, very enjoyable movie and I recomment it wholeheartedly!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Male precedent to Thelma and Louise?,"I have now finally watched Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid for the first time--only 50 years late! It's somewhat entertaining, and the shoot-out scenes are pretty good, but I am not sure I fully grasp why anyone would regard this as a total masterpiece. The protagonists really are just a couple of rogues, and they kill people willy-nilly when it becomes necessary to protect themselves from apprehension, but they don't have much in the way of redeeming qualities. I mean, they are liars and cheaters and killers, so how does that distinguish them from any other criminals in any other films or in history? At the end of the day, the whole reason for their crimes is that they want free money.The overall structure of the film reminds me of Thelma and Louise in several respects. All in all, not bad, but probably a touch overhyped, though I will say that the acting is good.One final note: I do not understand why ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"" is supposed to be relevant to this depiction of the dusty West. A strange theme song for the film, it seems to me. Yes, a good song, and nice that it was an original composition, but not really a good match.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Overrated bore...,"From the corny acting and one-liners (maybe 3 were funny?) to the incessant passing around of the girlfriend (I still can't assess who's girl it was) to the shrill music and long-ass pictures to substitute for acting, I thought it stunk. Heard so many good things about this, and I can handle a slow western (Outlaw Josey Wales). But this was something else. I only finished it on principle. Took me two days. Had to mute the Bolivian scenes, the music was so obnoxious, by God. Don't get the love for this weak, mediocre film. You could have accomplished the same thing, but in better fashion, with Young Guns II. Certainly has more heart, that's for sure.Give me True Grit or Josey Wales any day......this blows.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Overrated,"When I first saw this movie, I really couldn't see what all the fuss was about. To me this was just a rather ordinary western featuring two of the greatest actors of their time in Redford and Newman as well as one of Hollywood's most promising newcomers in Katherine Ross. However, this film fell rather flat. The only scenes that stuck out from my mind were the bicycle scene, the chases and, my favorite, the fight scene between Butch and Harvey Logan.I guess that you had to see it when it first was released to fully appreciate it for what it was. Remember, at the time that this film was released, America was just ending the most turbulent decade in its history since the Civil War. Events such as the assassinations of the Kennedy's and Martin Luther King, Woodstock, civil unrest and the election of a controversial president in Richard Nixon all made America seek an escape from all the turmoil that was going on and this film seemed to provide it. This film harkened back to a simpler time in American history and it touched a cord with the country. Also, the underlying theme of change could be seen as a parallel for what was going on in America at the time.This film may be a classic to most people, but in my eyes it fell flat.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Best Buds, Partners, and Bank Robbers through and through","Now I have watched this film before, but it doesn't change the fact at still how great it is!

There are so many funny and great lines in this movie, they add to the completion of the film so well.
Visuals are excellent for the time period. The film is good and colorful considering it was shot in 1969. The costumes, the settings, and the props are all great and add so much depth to the experience.

"the plot is conventional, but the talents of Newman, Redford, and Hill combined make it stand out above many of its fellow Westerns and earn it its place as a classic","Contained within the running time of George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is one of the greatest classic moments in the Western movie genre. The two titular characters (Paul Newman and Robert Redford) are trapped between a sheer drop into a river and a 'super-posse' of the best trackers, sharpshooters, and lawmen money can hire. One wants to take his chances jumping into the river, the other wants to shoot it out with the posse and they bicker with each other like an old married couple, partially forgetting about the bounty hunters coming up behind them.That's just one example of many classic moments in this memorable Western: a slightly fictionalized retelling of the true story of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, the two leaders of the Hole in the Wall outlaw gang that gained notable notoriety during the 19th century and into the early 20th century as they robbed trains and banks, fled from lawmen, tried to evade captured by fleeing to Bolivia, and just finding themselves wrapped up in the same mess again. Not very much is known about the personalities of the real Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid, but Newman and Redford's performances bring to life two of the most memorable characters in film history.Basically, we Butch, who is the brains of the outfit. He plots, his scams, he comes up with the wildest ideas to get out of their seemingly never-ending predicaments. He's also quite pacifistic, having never shot anybody before. And then there's Sundance, who is just the opposite. Quick on the draw, bulls-eye with the aim, pessimistic, ready to fight any day. There is no moment of true friendship seen between the two of them and we can't imagine how there ever could have been since they are constantly being locked up in arguments about what methods of escape they should take next. They seem attached to each other simply by the fact that they were the two more infamous outlaws of the time and had scrambled their way out of countless scenarios.We have two really good actors under the command of a really good director and they are what really makes this movie work. The plot: it's nothing special. Just the basic, outlaws-on-the-run conventional tale but the talents of these three men make it work above others. There is also director Hill's effective blending between moments of silence and serenity and constant, ominous brooding omens of the worst kind. Such as the rumbling, storm-like sound effects used for the approach of the 'super-posse', which really heighten the efficacy of their presence since we seldom see them up close.It's also a very well blend of action, adventure, humor, drama, and comedy all into one motion picture. No, it's not perfect and there are a few elements and scenes in the film that I am not in favor of, such as this sequence where nothing is shown on screen except a slide-show of photographs that really overstays its welcome at least for me. But putting these minor complaints aside, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a well-crafted Western and it continues to stand out as one of the most beloved classics of all time and it features one of the most exhilarating final gunfights I've ever seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

movie review,"This movie was excellent. Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid is an epic western. These two badass train/bank thieves strive to disappear from the face of the law, but the law won't let them. This movie was a beautiful work of art. So intelligently made. The movie had excellent cinematography, and the gratuitous violence was so loose, so flexible it had ""New Hollywood"" written all over it. The movies shot compositions were very creatively explored throughout the film. One of the best scenes is when Butch and Sundance Kid encounter Bolivian Indians who are trying to steal their money, the shootout is epic. Overall I really enjoyed this movie, I also loved the scene where Butch and Sundance's girl ride bikes together with the music playing in the background. It was intimate and so creative.

Quite enjoyable..,"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance KidButch Cassidy's gang is known in the whole west, they have a wide reputation for their robbings. As the time passes the law will no longer stand back and watch them rob everything, a special team is financed by one of their often victims, and the hunt starts.This is quite an enjoyable movie, and it has aged very well, actually there aren't many things that points out that it might be an older movie. If i had to point at something it is the different style they made movies back then and the less clear picture, but that is okay, becuase it gives a dusty feeling, which is good in this case because it is a western. The movie is also very beautifully photographed with many silent and beautiful images of the west, something that is a must-have for a western. But even though this is quite a good movie, there are still some flaws. One of them i think is that the movie is a bit long, i actually didn't get bored, but i still felt that some of the scenes are a bit too long, especially the first part of the movie, which somehow actually manages to last an whole hour. Also there aren't many action scenes, which is something i love about westerns, this movie seems to avoid them to focus more on the friendship of Sundance Kid and Butch Cassidy, and also we see them robbing almost a million banks.Robert Redford and Paul Newman is a fantastic couple on screen, i loved them both together here, their chemistry is very good, and is very important as their relationship is the main essence of the movie. Robert Redford is the mr cool as Sundance Kid, while Paul Newman is the smart and clever Butch Cassidy, who ain't much of a killer though, together they work very well.To sum it all up a bit, my honest opinion is that this movie is quite enjoyable and i feel confident that i will watch it again some day, it's not the best movie i have seen, but it works well and i didn't find myself waiting for it to end. I could have wished for some more action and some scenes cut down shurter, but i was actually positively surprised how well this movie has aged.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid: A Late-Made Classic,"When it comes to westerns, generally they were made in the late 1940s up until somewhat early 1960s. However this film came out in the end of the 1960s (1969). This genre was around for a long time and at this point it may have even been dying out. There were many great westerns made before this, yet this is one of the best ones out there. Great action to it, great story to it, and the actors are just phenomenal. As you watch the film, you feel like you're in the wild west with these guys shooting around and chasing down the people. Truly a great film. Would recommend to any western movie genre fan.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Masterpiece?? It's average at best!!,"What can I say about this movie?I have seen many classic movies and it was definitely enjoyable but the ratings and reviews often show this off as one of the best westerns ever made but I highly disregard those views because this movie is good but when I finished watching it I didn't feel like I watched one of the best westerns ever made.First of all the good things .. I really liked the feel of the movie and the the set pieces were well done as well.The 2 leading characters are very good but for me I feel Paul Newman really carried the movie,his character was wonderful and Robert Redford's character was good too but second place here
Now for the story ....it starts off really good with opening scene which was filmed really nice about a gang of bank and trainrobbers....and they introduce use to butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid.....great characters....but then......the movie for me just fails to deliver and create an unforgettable story.......because the characters were so wel written it could have been amazing but it just doesn't go anywhere really....there is a scene in the movie and this is not a spoiler but the 2 main leading men are running from the law and are being followed .....and followed .......and followed ......and followed......the scene just carries on for ages...it just felt really like a filler.Maybe I am one of the few people who feels like this but for me the movie is worth watching and it still is in my Bluray collection and I will probably watch it again but It didn't feel like a masterpiece.....but 6/10 I will give it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""I have vision, and the rest of the world wears bifocals""","Paul Newman and Robert Redford began their classic pairing in this, one of the finest westerns ever made. Note, it's not exactly a true western, with the lack of blood and dust and other types of cinematic features that make a real picture of the Old West. Still, BUTCHCASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID is a highly enjoyable flick that exploits the true story (not that it really mattered) about the two real-life outlaws. Packed with gunfights, chases on horseback, and the hilarious chemistry between the two stars, BUTCH AND SUNDANCE is the most fun for any fan of the western, and even non-discriminating fans.

A Story About Two Outlaws,"This is one of my favorite Western movies because of it's compelling story and characters. Butch and Sundance are outlaws that go way back. Their favorite pastime activity is robbing banks at gunpoint. 
Both of them have their heart in the right place but they just can't stop robbing banks because it's the only thing that they're good at. As they themselves have put it. Early in the movie we get an idea of how notorious the two are. Both are professionals and know exactly how to skillfully execute each robbery. Sundance is a quickdraw prodigy like no one else; both in aim and speed. Butch on the other hand is more of the strategist aka the brain of the operations. Storytelling-wise I really liked how both protagonists were introduced. It was on point, perfectly executed. More movies should pay attention to these types of aspects. Ever since I took Werner Herzog's masterclass on Filmmaking I realized how important it is to properly introduce characters (especially the protagonists) . I digress. The movie has a lot going for it. It has a fair amount of character development, good chemistry between the protagonists, memorable scenes and dialogues. It also has plenty of funny scenes like e.g. the dynamite scene.Another thing that makes the movie so interesting is the fact that it's vaguely based on real life events. There's nothing quite like a good 'ole Western movie about redemption.The main premise of the movie is quite self-evident: ""Can criminals be good guys?"". Well, Butch and Sundance sure tried to find out if that's possible. They are both self-aware enough to realize that what they've been doing so far is morally questionable. So, eventually they'll try to turn it around. If you want to know how the story ends you'll have to watch the movie I'm afraid. I don't want to spoil the movie.The cinematography is superb and especially impressive once you realize how old this movie is. My favorite scene, cinematography-wise, is the bicycle scene. Very smooth camera handling, I wonder what type of dolly system they used.Final verdict: highly recommended (it's an awesome movie with a lot of character. Even if you don't like Western movies; this one is worth a watch)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the more original and entertaining movies.,"Basically this is a great movie because it is being very unique and fresh with is approach. It's hard to describe this movie really. It's stuck somewhere between being a typical old fashioned western and a more modern one, while taking a very adventurous and entertaining approach to it all.Even though the western genre was still very popular at the time and also very much alive, this movie yet feels the need to look back at it and pay tribute, as if the genre had long been gone already. Really, I see this movie as an homage to the '60's westerns and it uses all of its very typical ingredients and even pokes some fun at it, without making the movie a parody of the genre. A real accomplishment, since you actually can really still take this movie as a comedy.But it however is more being a comedy because of how entertaining it is with its story and characters and not because it is filled with some slapstick or moments that will make you laugh out loud. It's more subtle than that, which helps to make the movie work out as a throughout entertaining one and a very pleasant watch.The movie mostly is being so fun and entertaining to watch, due to its two main characters, played by Paul Newman and Robert Redford. They are a great screen duo and portray some very memorable characters, with a great chemistry together. Besides, their acting is really great as well obviously. Especially Newman shines, like he basically always did, in every role he played in the '60's.It's also being a real adventure movie with its story, that takes you to a lot of places, while the two main characters are being on the run. During their journey they come across a bunch of different characters, while also still trying to make some money as well. Most western are of course more or less being like this but this one definitely all takes it a step further. It's actually being more of an adventure movie than a western, so even when you really aren't that big on westerns, you could still definitely enjoy this movie.It's a pleasantly directed movie, with a nice fresh and original approach to it. Visually there is also very little wrong with the movie. It has a great style all throughout, which really reminds you of the '60's western genre, while the movie at the same time still manages to feel like a much more modern movie as well, with a great and unique musical score by Burt Bacharach and a very young Sam Elliott in it too. It actually was his very first movie role and it perhaps isn't a coincidence that it is in a western.Simply one very entertaining movie!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

You've never met a pair like Butch and Sundance,Few films are able to capture such fabulous chemistry between all of its stars. I was introduced to this movie at a young age and it quickly climbed the ranks to become one of my all time favorites. Paul Newman and Robert Redford feel as though they've been working together for years. A give and take relationship. Its suprising since Redford wasn't even the first choice. Katharine Ross more than holds her own alongside the duo. You truly will fall in love with all three of them,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Unique among the westerns, we understand this film better in the light of the time in which it was made.","Butch Cassidy, Sundance Kid and the Hole in the Wall gang are in the ""Hall of Fame"" of the greatest thieves and robbers of the Old West. They had a long, varied and violent criminal career, with spectacular robberies of trains, stagecoaches and banks before moving to South America, where they spent all their money before returned to their old ways. They were persecuted by authorities in Argentina, Chile and Bolivia, where they apparently met their death at the hands of law enforcement. And I say ""apparently"" because, in fact, there are several theories that say that the two thieves somehow survived, and may have returned to US soil under the cover of new identities. True legends like that are always difficult to kill and, even in death, find a way to survive and endure in our imagination.Directed by George Roy Hill and written by William Goldman, the film is quite good and very well done, trying to follow the path of the two robbers. However, it is far from being a faithful portrayal of the facts, giving us instead a story sympathetic to the thieves, without the inflated patriotism of western films. It is necessary to consider that the film was made and released in 1969, in the midst of social protests that occurred due to the Sexual Revolution and the challenge to conventional values and concepts and, also, against the US participation in the Vietnam War. At a time of social and political turmoil, when many felt embarrassed by the attitudes of the USA, the film transforms each heist by Cassidy and Kid into an act of rebellion, of fight against the ""establishment"", of disobedience and rebellion against the authorities. Of course, it's a mindset that never occurred to them, and that ignores ethical and moral issues surrounding the eventual glorification of organized crime, in addition to forgetting the innocent lives that Cassidy and Kid were sacrificing.Director Hill did a very elegant job, especially in cinematography and footage. Look at the opening credits, or the first sequence in sepia, and the way color is gradually introduced during a cavalcade. The sets, props and costumes are also very good, although I have doubts about the historical accuracy with which they were designed. There are scenes that I can't understand in any other way than as deliberate winks at hippies, the most obvious of all being that bicycle scene, set to the suggestive melody ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head"". And let's face it, there are more comedic moments than serious action.For me, the biggest reason to see this unusual film is the impeccable performance of Paul Newman and Robert Redford, two great actors that we know well and whose talent is recognized by everyone. This is not one of the best that they have starred in, each of them has done better works, before and after, whether comic or dramatic. However, the way Newman and Redford played together is the film's greatest strength. Their partnership is remarkable, as the way they overcome each challenge. The film also features good work by Katharine Ross, who was experiencing the peak of her artistic career.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another Classic Western,"This 1969 western film was directed by George Roy Hill, and starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford. It tells the story of two infamous outlaws who flee to South America after a string of robberies in the American West.An interesting fact about the film is that it almost didn't happen. The studio initially passed on the project, but it was finally greenlit after a series of rewrites and casting changes. The film went on to become a critical and commercial success, winning four Academy Awards.Director George Roy Hill's use of freeze frames and sepia-toned images during key scenes added to the film's unique style and helped to create a sense of nostalgia for the Old West. The chemistry between Newman and Redford was undeniable, and their banter and camaraderie added to the film's charm.A classic western that combines action, humor, and heart. Its iconic performances make it a film to watch for any fan of the genre or cinema history.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A classic that left a legacy,"Just on the cusp of the 1970s, this movie is a total classic, with some very dated but still enjoyable montage scenes. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is famous for several reasons, one was the iconic first pairing of real-life friends Paul Newman and Robert Redford. They play off each other beautifully; it's easy to see their true friendship radiating off the screen. Of course, the ending is a famous and often spoofed scene, as is the jumping off the cliff scene.Partly tongue-in-cheek, partly just 1960s fun, the movie doesn't really pretend to be a period piece. Burt Bacharach's ""Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head"" hardly sounds appropriate to the time period, and Katherine Ross's 1969 hairstyle would never have been worn by any woman of the 1900s. But does that really matter when she rides atop Paul Newman's bicycle and breaks his heart by picking sourpuss Robert Redford instead? (You know I love him, but he's not exactly Likable Linda in this movie.) With all the charming moments, it's not really important that the film doesn't feel like a documentary of the Wild West. Lots of familiar faces grace the screen, including Strother Martin, Cloris Leachman, Kenneth Mars, Henry Jones, and Jeff Corey as the sheriff hunting the dynamic duo.To me, the legacy is the most beautiful aspect of the film. Paul Newman created a children's camp in 1988 for sick kids and their families, named Hole in the Wall Gang Club after the gang in this film. And everyone knows (or should know) Robert Redford founded the Sundance Film Festival in 1978, named after his character in the movie. Obviously, this film touched their hearts. Even if the movie wasn't a classic, it should be watched and respected for what the two men gave back in its name. And check out the prequel, Butch and Cassidy: The Early Years. It's adorable to see the young actors impersonate their predecessors, and Jeff Corey reprises his role, too!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Grand Western,"Normally I'm not a Western fan, but this film is an exception. The tale of Butch Cassidy and his gang is a well-know story of the days of yester- year. Paul Newman and Robert Redford as the titular characters are a real treat to watch on-screen in their first team-up. The humor in the film makes you almost forget that these two men are ""fierce"" thieves. This film is a ride through the history of Cassidy and Sundance's criminal career packed with comedy, drama and two great stars who only did two films together, but made the most of their time. If you're a Western fan then check this film out and be prepared for a good time.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Can it really be 50 years?,"Yes, 50 years of Butch and Sundance, and having seen it and loved it as a young 20-something when it first came out, my 10/10 is based on that, and all the pleasure it gave me way back then. I watched it again this week for maybe the 10th time, maybe more, when on a long flight on a 3rd world airline, where it was their one 'classic' on a menu which otherwise contained trashy 'action' films and Bollywood.So I sat back and thought ""let's while away the flight time in a bit of pure escapism with Butch and Sundance"". And once more I thoroughly enjoyed it. As well as Paul Newman, Robert Redford and Katharine Ross, I have always loved the little cameo role played by Strother Martin, who had teamed up with Newman two years earlier to make 'Cool Hand Luke', one of my great favourite movies. ""What we have here is a failure to communicate!""However, viewed now against 21st century societal values, I have to admit to finding some discomfort in this portrayal of two men who in reality were low-life outlaws, who robbed banks and trains, and never hesitated to shoot at anyone who got in their way. Robbing a bank in the old west probably meant stealing the life savings of all the good honest people of that town, so why should we try and generate any sort of empathy with these two?I was also uneasy with the role of Etta Place, a woman totally subservient to the wishes of these two men.But we must in the end judge it by the standards of the era in which it was made, and it is indeed a brilliant and captivating piece of movie-making.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Friends & Outlaws,"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is an entertaining amusing comedy of the friendship shared between the two buds. The legendary outlaws and their Hole in the Wall gang,they came toward the end of a long stream of bank and train robbers in the 19th century. Their exploits were perfect for a film that was intended to portray outlaws who mock and defy the law of the land.The film is filled with great scenery shots as well. One interesting aspect of the film was that instead of the over the top violence typical of outlaw films, the screenplay focused on the journey of the bandits, using slapstick comedy, conventional Western action, contemporary music, and funny dialogue to define the past and mock typical western film clichés, in a genera that was dying out.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Boy, for a gunman you sure are pessimistic.""","One of the best westerns of ALL TIME. When it originally was released, Roger Ebert was one of the few who hated it, even as to compare it to ""Bonnie and Clyde"". Now, I do acknowledge that the prior mentioned film is historically relevant because it sparked the end of the former Production Code and made violence 'cool', as well as popularized the French New Wave style of film making, but I didn't really care for that one. I'm all for romanticizing the so-called villains of history, but the tone in that film was way too hyperactive. One minute it was grueling violence, another it was comedic. All of a sudden you hear that comedic theme as they make their get-away. The reason I find this film superior is that tone is consistent, and the darker nature of it is much more subtle. For example, Katherine Ross' character, among others, constantly reminds our titular duo that their age of prosperity is over, though they never really seem to except it.Paul Newman is forever iconic as Butch Cassidy and Robert Redford no less as the Sundance Kid. The film's strongest aspect is the close relationship between these friends, and the tremendous acting really exemplifies this throughout. It'd be insane to try and count how many films have attempted to mimic this glorious and unbeatable chemistry between the duo, and on the opposite end just how many have failed miserably. The comedic nature of most of their dialogue is fitting and just so memorable, I dare to watch the film and not walk away quoting it. Like the sequence where the train robbery goes wrong and that haunting pursuit begins. Of course, there is that hilarious exchange with the assistant Woodcock (George Furth), but it leads up to one of my favorite series of lines between Newman and Redford; ""How many are following us?""""All of 'em."" ""All of 'em? What's the matter with those guys?"" I love how the pursuit was shot if you ask me, makes it feel much more personal and foreboding. Not to mention you get to see more of the glorious cinematography of Conrad L. Hall which captures the Western feel quite nicely. And oh yeah, this film is one of the few to pull off an anachronistic score so well. Before ""Spiderman 2"" or ""Clerks 2"", let be known this film made use of that oh so familiar song, and in the best way too.A+",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Terrific Comedy/Western  ""Who are those guys?""","Still as fresh to day as it was when it came out (1969 wow ). Newman and Redford look as though they are having a great time and their interaction is a key factor in the movies sparkle. An enjoyable romp with lot's of one-line comedy but still has enough action and bitter-sweet moments to add grit. The movie owes a lot to the terrific screen-play but added together with the fine cast and able direction it's a winner.

Fun and fabulous, if you see the video then grab it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The two robbers...,"""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is a western - crime movie in which we watch two professional robbers who robe banks and trains which deliver money. When the law comes really close to them, they go to Bolivia in order to get away but more problems come up. Also these two robbers are best friends who are trying to do their best for their ""job"" and earn as much money as they can.I liked this movie not so much about the plot but for the interpretations of the cast and especially for the interpretations of Paul Newman and Robert Redford who played as Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid respectively. I also have to mention that the direction of George Roy Hill was simply magnificent and he did a really great job on it. Something else that I also liked in this movie was that is based on the exploits of some historical characters and this is something that makes this movie special and unique.Lastly I believe that ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is a good movie to watch and worth seeing because it has plenty of suspense and makes you be in tense in the whole duration of it. I also believe that this movie has to be considered as a must watch movie for the fans of western movies or just the fans of crime movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not for me I'm afraid,"Well here goes as I know the vast majority of people won't agree with this review. I watched this movie for the first time(yes, really!!) recently and it left me disappointed and underwhelmed. The partnership between Paul Newman and Robert Redford works very well and you could tell that the actor's liked each other. The cinematography is good too but that is about all I liked.It is boring with not a lot happening a lot of the time. The music doesn't fit the western feel of the movie at all and even 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' makes no sense at all given the fact that the whole of the song takes place during glorious sunshine! It is a buddy movie, I get that, but the wisecracking wore a bit thin and even the acting was very hit and miss. I just couldn't engage with the story at all even though the two leads were likeable enough.This is a movie of it's time and seemed very dated to me.

Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"This offbeat western stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford, two guys who acted with their good looks. Newman is Butch Cassidy, and Redford is the Kid.

Butch and the Kid end up in Bolivia, and that is why I resurrected this movie, because I am going to Bolivia for a star party in the Andes. Katherine Ross (a Natalie Wood look-alike) is the Kid's girl. Of course, both men want her. The bicycle scene is memorable, and the gambling scene is cool. The story is set in 1910. Burt Bacharach's song, ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head"" is showcased and takes us back to an era when Top 40 was king.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

They didn't go over the top with cliche characters and dialogue like I find many westerns do to make the story more enjoyable. This film was done so well, they don't have to. As a matter of fact the silent scenes where there is no dialogue help to make this movie the classic it is. Great story, great acting, great movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Fantastic Film,I personally loved this movie. As a kid watching this I thought it was a great movie and was one of my favorites. Now watching it again years later I have come to appreciate it even more. The acting is just flat out superb throughout the movie. Robert Redford (The Sundance Kid) and Paul Newman (Butch Cassidy) play their roles so well and show the real companionship of their characters. They integrate a funny yet serious role throughout the movie. One of my favorite scenes was when they were trying to decide who would jump off the cliff first. Sundance is telling Butch that he can't swim but rather than telling him it would be alright he says that the fall would probably kill him and then they both jump at the same time.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Eastern Western,"I am compelled to rant for a moment. Anyone familiar with the ""Reviews"" system in the Rotten Tomatoes Community knows about the little sidebar that shows up when you write. It shows the three most recent user reviews for that particular picture. At this moment, I'd like to share the kind of unfortunate crap that people think about movies:""Watch it, that is all."" ""Probably the first of the westerns with slapstick humor"" ""One of the best Westerns ever made, Paul Newman and Robert Redford make one of the best pairings in cinema history.""...what?I honestly want to see a list of the pictures these people have seen that they would consider ""Western."" BUTCH is about as much of a Western as NO COUNTRY. It's an homage from a much different time. BUTCH is what happens if you take a bunch of cocky youths out of their VW Rabbit, give them a joint, make them watch THE TIN STAR, and then hand them a camera.Indeed, this is precisely what makes BUTCH such an enduring picture. It preserves both a tested cinematic format and the edginess of 1969. But is it deserving of the label ""one of the best Westerns ever made""? No way. It is a shameless carbon-copy of BONNIE & CLYDE. The second half of the film is remarkably slow. And, those who have seen it will understand, it is too damn pretty.I will agree that Newman and Redford make an endearing couple. Redford's passion for cinema is tangible and Newman follows his impossibly charming lead. But there's something else. I never pick up on cinematic homoeroticism. But here? Even Little Ms. Robinson can't calm them down.Those who point to DAYS OF HEAVEN as some kind of cinematographic landmark need to take another look at BUTCH. The picture-taking is so under-appreciated. Perhaps it is so because it is remarkably out of place. The camera is outrageously active. It plays around with weird and aimless focus lengths, puzzling apertures, and every zoom opportunity in sight. It doesn't fit. But that doesn't change the fact that some of the darkest, most dazzling photography of the second half of the century lies dormant in this picture.None of my evaluation changes the fact that I watched this movie with my father. I remember him recommending it to me years ago and we finally looked at it last night. He saw it in on the big screen when it came out in '69 and there is no substitute for the joy a movie lover can feel when he or she enjoys their favorite hobby with someone so close and who shares the real connection we seek.58.5",,Anonymous,Biography
"Quality Work, but Quite Dry","Like in the film ""The Sting,"" (1973) Newman and Redford make a great pair. But this isn't anywhere near
as clever or as intriguing as that.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
Yes, I know this is supposed to be close to a ""true story,"" but it's kind of bland. Is it interesting? Well,
sort of, but not that much. The banter between the two leads is entertaining, along with their casual
attitude at times (more often than not). This cavalier tone adds a levity to the story, but it also dilutes
it from any depth of the characters.I think that's why it feels quite shallow to me ... there's just no depth of story (or character), anywhere.ACTING:
Sure, the acting is fine. But it's almost as if Newman and Redford are more or less just walking through this.Part of the problem is I don't see anything that either actor is asked to do, that isn't already part of their
innate persona. It's like their mentality is stuck on some set, so there's a lack of seriousness. Maybe they're
just too sophisticated for these parts. Yes, that's it. These two fine actors were poor picks for the roles.This reminds me of Jimmy Stewart in westerns --- it simply doesn't work (unless you count
""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962)).Note: Ross was just a ""walkie talkie.""TEMPO:
OK, but it seems choppy, like someone really didn't work the history and develop a more cohesive and
entertaining story.CINEMATOGRAPHY:
Very niceDIRECTING / WRITING:
Director: There's just too much TV in Hill's resume. That usually means a formulaic approach, which is
fine for TV. Here, the directing is good, but something's missing.Writer: Goldman has some very nice work to his credit, e.g. ""All the President's Men"" (1976), ""Heat"" (1986),
""The Princess Bride"" (1987), etc. But this is far too dry for my liking.Is it a good film? OK, but has a limited appealShould you watch this once? Yes.Rating: 7.5.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Solid western about two personalities,"This movie is in some ways pretty uninspired. It follows two clever and super talented bandits with hearts of gold through a period of their life. In that regard, it's a run of the mill western. Don't get me wrong, they are both very likable, and the chemistry between them is really good. But as far as plot goes, it is nothing new.What makes this movie stand out to me, is how unusually it is structured. I find this to me true with several of the movies written by Goldman, but it's not a typical 3-act ordeal, where you could summarize the excitement with a graph. It goes from here to there, and navigates expertly through moments of peril and moments of calm.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Seeing Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid the way it was meant to be seen,"George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid(1969) has long been one of my favorite films. The combination of great photography of amazing landscapes, a brilliantly witty and charming script by William Goldman and outstanding performances by two of the great leading men in the history of American cinema make the film one of the most watchable and most enjoyable pictures I'm sure I will ever see. I had watched the film at least half a dozen times but upon learning that the film would be screened in Albany's Palace Theatre as part of SEFCU's Classic Movie Series I leapt at the chance to see Butch, Sundance and Etta on the big screen in a beautifully designed local landmark. It was an amazing experience, complete with the old fashioned ""Let's go out to the lobby"" cartoons and scratches and blotches on the over 40 year old film stock this was the genuine article and it felt as if I had traveled back in time for two hours. A great film and a great experience and I'd encourage anyone to see Butch Cassidy or any other classic film on the silver screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not Traditional, Original","This is by no means a traditional western. Whatever that is. The Son's of Katie Elder or The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly I suppose. Anyway what we have here is cinematic gold between Newman and Redford. Brilliant chemistry and dialogue throughout. The scenes flow well and the editing is decent from once scene to the next. For 1969 I'm sure this was a big ass deal. In 2022 this film still stands tall in my opinion and is probably a top 10 western of all time. My only gripe would have to be the score. There's some great tunes in here but some are a little cheesy. I understand it's not a traditional western but it's almost a masterpiece without them sadly. All in all you're getting probably the greatest duo to ever hit the screen in a highly entertaining western sure to catch your eye. I wish I could rate it a 9.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Wild Bunch light.,"Released on the hooves of Sam Peckinpah's blood drenched last gasper The Wild Bunch Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a kinder gentler more sanitized for public consumption look at outlaws on the run with the Twentieth Century gaining on them fast. It even has a pop tune video and a jolly Burt Bacharach score to keep things light and mawkish which might spell disaster for a wild west shoot'em up were it not for the legendary first and best pairing of Newman and Redford as Butch and Sundance.The Hole in the Wall Gang has been making a living robbing trains for awhile when the Pinkerton's begin to intensify their pursuit. With their membership decimated Butch, Sundance and his girlfriend light out east to NY and eventually on to Bolivia in hopes of beginning anew.The naturalness between the laid back Butch and the wound tight Sundance has the perfect cadence of a friendship partnership developed over time as they play off of each other with the comfortable familiarity of a Tracy Hepburn duo.For a film featuring protagonists with a bounty on their head Cassidy has an upbeat mood most of the way as director Arthur Hiller keeps things light and polished but nearly sacrifices the picture in favor of entertainment with the intrusive BJ Thomas ditty video and an overlong montage of tintype imagery from Coney Island. It is left up to Conrad Hall's cinematography, especially in low light situations, to supply the film's power and suspense with one outstanding composition after another. With Hall's strong look informing the picture and Newman/Redford clicking like Rogers and Astaire Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is well worth a watch in spite of it's heavy saccharine aftertaste.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"Robert Redford and Paul Newman are on super form in this story of the eponymous turn of the century train robbers. There is loads of charisma on display as this pair take a sort of care in the community approach to their crimes.

Eventually the authorities catch up with them, and after a period of trying to go straight, they succumb to boredom and along with ""Etta"" (Katharine Ross) they flee to Bolivia to start all over again. It's this bit of the the film that I enjoyed most - thanks in no small part to a few short scenes from the always personable Strother Martin (""Percy Garris"") before an ending that - along with the scene featuring Newman and Ross on their bicycle - is the stuff of cinema legend. The films looks good - the use of still photography to tell aspects of the story and the innovative use of the Bacharach and David soundtrack works well to sustain and to vary the pace of this film. It is a classy piece of cinema well worth watching some 50 years after it was made.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A new kind of western!,"I am not one who enjoys western movies at all. Watching ""Stagecoach"" i nearly fell asleep! This film was surprisingly different. Rather than all the tough, cold action from normal westerns, Butch and Sundance added much humor to the film. It was a film where you are actually on the bad guys side because their characters are so likable! I enjoyed how Butch, played by Paul Newman, and Sundance, played by Robert Redford were such a dynamic duo! The script was very well written. Most western films have very cheesy lines, and an unnatural tone, but this film worked just perfectly. The dry humor was such a nice touch.It was interesting to see how quickly after the Hays Code had ended that there was nudity in films in the late sixties. For example when Butch's girlfriend undresses in front of him. This type of material never would have been allowed even ten years prior.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Who ARE Those Guys?!,"There are a lot of things that make BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID one of the greatest Western films of all times. Take a solid screenplay by William Goldman, put in a great director like George Roy Hill, and pair Paul Newman and Robert Redford as the two titular characters, and the end result is a hugely entertaining and witty adventure that takes us from the high plains of the West to the out-of-the-way jungles of Bolivia.Admittedly the details about the real-life late 19th century outlaws Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and their Hole-In-The-Wall gang are softened for purposes of entertainment (the real-life participants were among the most notorious badmen in the history of the Old West), but it is quite a thing to see Newman and Redford get away with so much because we can't help but like them. And when the Union Pacific railroad sends a posse after them following the blowing up of a payroll train, we fear for their lives (as they keep asking themselves ""Who ARE those guys?!""). The two men and their schoolteacher love interest Etta Place (Katharine Ross) hightail it down to Bolivia to continue their outlaw ways; but soon, they become wanted men again as ""Bandidos Yanquis."" Attempts by Newman and Redford to ""go straight"" by getting into the employ of an eccentric payroll master (the always-colorful Strother Martin) don't go as planned; and then it all comes down to a standoff in a small Bolivian town.BUTCH CASSIDY was released in the same year (1969) as three other radically different Westerns: the more traditional John Wayne-led, Henry Hathaway-directed TRUE GRIT; Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH; and Sergio Leone's ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. Although not anywhere near as violent as Peckinpah's, nor as surreal as Leone's, this film is still much more cynical than TRUE GRIT, since, like Peckinpah's film, it mourns the loss of the Old West, as progress and road agents are now strangling a once-limitless frontier and forcing outlaws and renegades south. And like Leone, it also shows even the railroad becoming more corporatized as the 20th century dawns. All of this is happening, even as Burt Bacharach's score (complete with ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"") plays on, and we see Butch and Sundance getting away with a whole lot of money and a whole lot of schemes. At the same time, however, after being told by an ornery sheriff (Jeff Corey), ""Your times is over! Don't you get it?!"", they realize that they are probably not going to live much longer.As a result, BUTCH CASSIDY, for all the fun it shows us, is every bit as fatalistic as Leone's and Peckinpah's radical restructurings of the Western myths. And yet it is this dichotomy that makes the film such an enduring film of its genre, with Newman and Redford perfectly matched (as they would be again, and with Hill directing, in 1973 for THE STING), and superb cinematography by Conrad Hall. Nobody should miss this film, especially when it comes to being a fan of that most American of film genres, the Western.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Fun movie, not really an epic Western","I thought this was a fun movie (a solid 8 of 10) but I didn't get the feeling that it was a grand epic Western as some people say.  The Burt Bacharach music was nice but a little bit corny in the context of this movie.  The interlude with the old-style, sepia-toned photographs of their adventures in New York (while waiting for the ship to Bolivia) was well done.  Redford & Newman did a great job with their characters but I didn't really care for anybody else in the movie and it was pretty much just their show.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
amazing on screen chemistry makes up for terrible post production.,"This film is classic Paul Newman. If you have never seen him act start here. Robert Redford is amazing. The duo is deadly hilarious. The back and fourth between them makes this movie what it is. The comedy helps drive this movie that is based in the traditions of a genera that has mostly lost it's audience. This movie has amazing acting from the entire cast and is entertaining all the way through. There are multiple classic Hollywood western gun battles. Each scene is shot beautifully in the wild frontier, not giving up a single detail. One thing that takes away from the movie is the music. it is often un appropriate for the scene or is distracting from what is happening on the screen. If you can get past the music the film becomes a lot better. The one thing that stands out the most in my mind and makes this movie one of the greats is the chemistry between Redford and Newman. seeing the two of them on screen together makes this movie an instant classic that i will continue to watch for the rest of my life.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A western with an upbeat sense of humour,"A movie starring Paul Newman and young Robert Redford, playing the eponymous outlaws, who operated in Wyoming during the final years of the Old West. They made a legend as the most successful train robbers of all time and as gentlemen who tried to avoid killing as much as possible. Of course the truth is a bit more jaded than this movie would have you believe, but even the real events were quite outlandish and almost like from a pulp novel.The movie is very much a western, no doubt about that, but for a western it's bit of an odd duck. That's because it actually has a sense of humour without being an outright comedy. Butch and Kid have very upbeat attitude when it comes to life and their chosen career and even during their toughest moments they have time to exchange banter and jokes about them being in trouble. Not that the movie cannot take itself seriously when it is called for, but overall the film has a lighthearted tone for a western. Which is nice, I have to admit.The score is also odd, to say the least. I'd even dare to call it ill-fitting, but it somehow manages to work. Just don't ask me how.The best thing about this movie is without a doubt the main duo. They're pure dynamite as actors, especially when sharing a screen. Because the film is based on real events, the actual plot is a bit episodic in nature, which is not an outright flaw, but I can only imagine what the film would have been like if they had taken these two characters and told a more coherent story with them. It would have been something unbelievable.Still, even as it is, the film is one of the better westerns I've seen in years and definitely worth a watch for all fans of the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Their dynamic work so well even when it's subtle. They both capture the fearless cowboy touch of their character which adds so much class to the action scenes. They both also bring the humor but what makes it so funny is how unintentional and random it gets. Katherine Ross work in this shouldn't go unmentioned. Her ability to display the wave of emotions that her character goes through is so moving. She brings so much definition to her character feelings.Whole movie is stunning.

"This Movie Makes You Want to Root for  Logan, not  Butch","This movie is so overrated. I literally fell asleep watching this so-called 'breakthrough western' and wasted my hard-earned money on the special edition DVD. It's like this: Hollywood takes a bit of history out of books and colors it by using the annoying actor Newman and Redford to portray the two outlaws, and engages the two characters on a fictional romp through North and South America. It seems Hollywood is always trying to look for anything with a tad of historical interest to put on the big screen, and 'Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid'was all fluffed up to make an unremarkable event 'exciting'. But the truth is this film has so many drawn out, silent moments (that stretch tiredly throughout two and a half hours) it ends up being boring without being entertaining. The reason it was a 'breakthrough' movie in the late 60's is because it tried to win our hearts by portraying Butch and Sundance as two sympathetic,anti-hero characters. In reality, however, they were just ordinary crooks. The anti-conservative bent of the late 60's and early 70's raises its ugly head in this movie. I wonder what people were eating and drinking in those days, but it seems they were all fed with this kind of Hollywood trash. Too bad big Logan didn't do away with scrawny little Butch in the so-called 'famous' knife fight scene. That would have ended the slow pace of the movie and made my day.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
One Line Summary,"In this film, Paul Newman (Butch Cassidy) and Robert Redford (Sundance Kid) go on quite the adventures with their no good actions. Days on days the two rob banks and do so much damage they move to a different country. They bring along Katharine Ross (Etta Place) as their undercover. The two of them (sometimes with Etta's help) ended up doing a lot of damage, but they got worse damage in the end.Since this film is based on a true story the theme would be to not take what doesn't belong to you. We always want what we can't have and sometimes more of it. When we repeat the same actions over and over (stealing) we will eventually pay the consequences. Sometimes worse later on if we keep acting on poor decision making.Butch and Sundance Kid traveled long a far to escape their ""consequences"". They didn't want to fess up to their actions and it was thrill for them to get away with it. The two went through great lengths to escape their troubles and always were one step ahead of their enemy. Butch and Sundance Kid were not all that worried of getting caught. They knew they were the two most wanted men, other than that they just went about their days like everyone else.Butch and Sundance Kid only looked out for one another and would cover for each other. Their relationship was very secluded with just the two of them. They may have had ""other"" friends in the ""whole in the wall gang"" but the two of them were the leaders that stuck together through and through.The angles throughout the film pay close attention to their ""escaping segments"". They literally show the highs and lows and in between. As a viewer you see them rock climbing, jumping off the rocks into a flowing river which gives you a more than actual feeling of being there because on the angle that scene focuses on all together. The lighting in this seen is surprisingly bright and sunny. Figuring they have been on a horse, their own two , feet for days it was like a free moment for them just to jump and cool off and just got with the flow (no pun intended).Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid teaches you a lot more than just how to escape after stealing, it teaches you consequences, respect, and vulnerability.",,Anonymous,Biography
The greatest Western I ever saw!,"This Western is for real! ""Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid"" were one of the toughest outlaws in the West, yet they made their mark in history. Butch(Paul Newman) and Sundance(Robert Redford) new the tricks of the trade on robbery. He and his gang would rob the Union Pacific RR and other banks just to get their kicks. I liked the part where the gang would have Harvey Logan(Ted Cassidy, Lurch on the ""The Addams Family"", and the Narrator of ""The Incredible Hulk"") be in charge of the robberies. Butch and the Kid wouldn't allow it. So they fight about it and Logan is put down fast. Then there's Etta Place(Katherine Ross, ""The Graduate"") who woos both the Kid and Butch. I like the bicycle scene where the song ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head"". That scene would be mimicked in ""The Great Muppet Caper"" Yes these two would go all the way in robbing banks, but when the price goes up, they reroute to Bolivia. Ever since they been east, the trio had plenty of fun without robbing a bank in that area. Yep, they went down in Bolivia, or did they? I heard resources that they survived the attack despite the wounds. But who's to say? This is a true story, despite a few changes I liked it though.

You had to be there,"I was like 15 when this movie came out. Movies were really different in the old days. They took way more time developing a story and characters before the climax started to slowly build. Younger generations are accustomed to the fast-paced stories and action of today's screen writing and cannot endure the slower pace of older movies. I agree, they seem to languish and even stagnate at some places, but what younger generations don't have, is the nostalgic connection of where they were and who they were when they fist viewed this movie. This was a coming-of-age movie for me and it represents way more than just celluloid stretches of what many would qualify as adequate or even mediocre acting, effects, locations, music, never before seen supporting characters and actors. It was a piece of my mid to late teens that contains memories of the life and times in which that movie played.

Mediocre at best,"Comedic western based on actual people--Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford). They were outlaws in 1880s and robbed banks. The plot of the movie (what little there is of it) has them robbing banks, joking with each other nonstop, riding from the police, robbing banks, joking with each other etc etc etc. It's basically the same thing over and over. Newman and Redford work well with each other. They toss off one-liners (some that are quite funny) with ease in a care-free, easy-going manner. The problem is that's all their characters are--walking talking joke machines. No complexity or depth is ever shown. Poor Katharine Ross (who can be very good) is also shamefully wasted as Redford's girlfriend. Even worse Redford is terrible as the Kid--blank-faced throughout. Slow-moving and too long also and it turns needlessly violent at the end. There's also a near-rape in the film that's treated as a joke!The movie has some good points--it starts out in sepia (a nice touch) and doesn't turn into color until about 10 minutes in; the bicycle sequence with Newman and Ross with the song ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"" (an Oscar winner) playing; Newman is very good in his role and the lines are funny.

I thought the final scene was great, just those last few minutes... it was directed in a nice way to end the storyline.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Melancholy Nostalgia As Escapist Fantasy,"I saw this movie at the drive in when it came out in 1969. I was six at the time, and much too young to appreciate the superb performances or the beautiful scenery. I got too annoyed by little things, too. Like Butch kicking the mean bully in the balls. That's heroic? Even at six I wanted something more from my heroes. And then the mock-rape scene. Redford holds a woman at gunpoint, but hey -- she's really into it! Even at six, something just didn't smell right.Okay, so fifty years later, I got this movie on DVD for five dollars from Wal Mart. And at fifty-seven I finally understand why it was a huge hit. The sense of time passing us all by. The melancholy nostalgia for youth and beauty. The pleasurable self-pity in every lilting note and every sepia-toned photo. This is a movie that really bathes the audience in warm, romantic sadness. Despair has never been enacted with such verve and charm.Of course, all this comes at a price. The audience has to accept the idea that individuals are powerless in the grip of history, and the era defines the man. The Sixties had a fatalistic side which is rarely remembered today. William Styron's Confessions of Nat Turner presented the great black hero in a very Butch and Sundance way -- charming, but doomed to fail.Anyway, the performances and the sheer style of the picture make up for a lot of the weepy self-pity and smug despair. No matter what people say, I think Katherine Ross was perfect -- sensual, but not too far from innocence. Passionate, but sensible. She's the opposite of Scarlett O'Hara. Like Scarlett, she loves two men, but unlike Scarlett she gets the best of both relationships. That's because she's basically unselfish and completely honest about her feelings. The love triangle is the one area of the film that's genuinely modern and free from sentimentality. The way Etta makes up her own mind when to stay and when to go is as unusual in movies today as it was in 1969!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

An Almost Perfect Western,"The Good Ole Western movies which enchant movie lovers all over the world is one of my favorite genres. Fascinated By Sergio Leone, I have watched very few westerns made by film-makers apart from him. But I am glad I watched this one. Supposedly based on true facts about an infamous gang of robbers in the late 18th century which is led by the master-mind Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and his 'talented' associate Sundance Kid (Robert Redford), this movie talks about the rise and fall of the protagonists. It has all the ingredients of a classic western - Train/Bank Robberies, Excellent Cinematography, Great Locations ranging from desert sand dunes to flowing rivers, impressive BGM and perfect casting.Newman has a charming screen presence, He is one actor from whom you cannot take your eyes off. But Redford has matched Newman in every scene which is a tough task to follow.

A couple of 'iconic' elements have hoodwinked the majority into calling this a great film...,"... but so far as I could see; the ONE great scene has been shown on Oscar telecasts too many times for it to rescue an enterprise that's otherwise so lazy. Yes; Newman and Redford are accomplished, but I wouldn't have expected anything less from them - What I would have expected from the film is a solid 'backstory' for our characters, and a sense of urgency from the narrative; instead of the constant feeling that we're supposed to nudge each other and laugh as our lackadaisical heroes amble their way through life. Burt Bacarach may have crafted a good tune; but that doesn't excuse what felt like an eternity wasted watching Newman ride a bicycle... He's a great actor; but even HE can't enliven a moment so mundane.The admittedly memorable ending wouldn't serve as 'too little, too late' had the movie earned it's 'veneration' of these two unexceptional vagabonds; but the movie failed to convince me over its running time that these chaps were in any way 'special'.

The script must have taken quite a while to compose and implement. there's beautiful cinematography and really snappy dialogue. the landscapes are beautiful during the endless chase.

Understatted and Entertaining,"Robert Redford made a number of films for director George Roy Hill in the late 1960s/early 1970s, two of them (this film, and 'The Sting') with fellow mega-star Paul Newman. Unlike 'The Sting', 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' ambles along with no particular regard to plot structure. These days, films are made faster and tauter than this, and the slow pace sometimes frustrates (especially during the dated, Burt Baccarach musical numbers); but it also has benefits, maximising the low key humour of the script which would surely fail if the pace was forced. I'm not so certain about Redfrod's casting, however: 'The Kid' is actually something of a grizzled character, and Redford arguably plays best as the fresh-faced young innocent: the moustache he wears gives the impression of concealing a permanent smirk. But the film is very easy to watch in spite of this, and is consistently entertaining, even if it lacks 'The Sting's sheer vitality.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Lifeless and soulless,"I waited so long to see this...why? I don't know.I was expecting lots of laughs, some good old fashioned gun fights in saloons, real western stuff.However what I got a a boring, lame-ass, put me to sleep movie, nothing really worth viewing or waiting to view.Aside of some decent camera shots and settings, and the nice stunt work from jumping off a cliff into some rapids...the rest is just a waste.What I don't understand is...these 2 guys robs banks and trains and payroll...they have a ton of cash to spend, but they decide to flee the country with all their wealth and do nothing with it.They eat lavish and wear very nice attire and can live very well of with what they have in finance, but they don't.What kind of stupidity is that? Say that you've robbed a whack of banks...gathered up around $500 000 in todays currency and fled the country to another country where your money will make you uber wealthy...Why even bother to continue to rob and steal? Buy a house, live by the beach, go fishing...whatever...They had the money to go on a train and on a ship across the ocean and to start all over, fresh...but they totally wasted this opportunity.And back then, it was much easier in terms of getting away with crime So the overall story sucked.Even written in the late 60's, this made for a a really boring movie.After viewing Bonnie & Clyde and Butch Cassidy and the Sudance Kid within 2 weeks of each other, I realize that back in the late 60's...making quality films was close to non-existent.All one has to do is have some lame action for about 2 hours and the characters have to travel across the country - as in soooooo many movies that were made in the 60's and 70's.Assuming that these were really great scripts - which they are not, I would have hated to read the one which the studios passed on.I guess if somebody was able to type 130 pages or so script on a type writer without too many errors, then it would be made into a screenplay.I have seen too many movies where the stories were just time wasters - and they were made in the 60's.Aside from some Clint Eastwood flicks, the rest are just super boring.No real western that emerged from the 60's or 70's had any real plot.Catherine Ross's character was a waste - as were most of the actors in this title.Am I impressed? No.Is it Oscar material? No.Is it to stand the test of time? No Is it a remedy for putting somebody to sleep fast after a long day of work or insomnia? YES! For a movie that I always wanted to see...this sucked.Another Hollywood let down.I am slowly realizing that I don't care to see cinema from generations PRE 1980.If this is quality story telling, then I would rather look at porn...it has as much depth, but is more visually stimulating.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
A perfect blending of script with acting of Newman and Redford.,"September 2019 edit: I just watched it again, after 14 additional years, and a couple of weeks after watching a Butch and Sundance documentary. It has aged well.This is the movie that placed Redford on the ""A list"" of actors. Relatively unknown in 1967, when production began, the bosses wanted a better known actor, perhaps Steve McQueen. But Redford, just 30, turned out just perfect as the Sundance Kid. Newman as Butch Cassidy was in his early 40s and together, as they did in ""The Sting"", their acting chemistry resulted in this classic. At first it was panned by many critics but the story of friendship struck a chord with movie-goers and the Newman/Redford combination made it a hit.Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid were real outlaws, operating in the late 1800s and early 1900s. While the script romanticizes them quite a bit, the overall story is mostly accurate. However, there forever remained a question about what really happened to them. This movie depicts one scenario. The real Etta Place was a prostitute but here she is a school teacher, played by the beautiful Katharine Ross.The movie establishes the characters early with a bank robbery and escape. Then the middle story involves their being hunted by a hired band of 6 in retaliation for several train robberies. Humor is injected in lines such as, ""If he would just pay us what it costs to hire them, I wouldn't have to steal his money anymore."" They manage to escape in the great scene where they jump off a cliff into a river. Tired of running, Butch and Sundance, with Etta along, travel to New York, then take a ship to South America to start fresh.The DVD has a nice presentation in Widescreen. The extras are interesting, with modern day interviews with the main actors and others.While the real outlaws traveled all over S. America, this movie has them just going to Bolivia. There they rob banks and still are chased by the band of 6 from America. But their undoing came in a small village at the hands of the local police, bolstered by dozens of military troops called in with loaded rifles. In the final scene, both wounded, Butch and Sundance run into the little town square, pistols firing, then the picture freezes them.",,Anonymous,Biography

But you said you,"I have never quite worked out why I like this movie so much. Based on a true story, and according the the sister of Butch Cassidy, it accurately portrays that character.Butch and Sundance are 2 wild west outlaws whose daring robberies get them chased all across the wild west in spectacular fashion. Finally they leave for Bolivia where they start a new crime spree.Taking the 1960s and 70s idea of crime as a great adventure it shows these characters as human. Certainly something different from the movies showing the slow talking, fasting shooting John Wayne types.It shows crime for what it is and the consequences. The ending is open ended because rumours still persist that they really moved to Argentina to become ranchers (recent digs in the town in Bolivia have failed to find their remains).No other Western movie has quite managed to capture the feel of this movie, one of the fun ones (I even liked the bicycle riding sequence, though many friends felt it was a waste of time).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Goldman and George Roy Hill have ways of making you need to search.  For example, the random music sequences.  If you think about it, they're hilarious, but some people just see them as weird.  It's remarkably deeper than surface humor.  Overall, it's a great great GREAT movie.  One of the greatest screenplays ever written, and probably THE greatest comedy screenplay.

Beautifully crafted blend of fact and fiction,"Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid were two American outlaws infamous for robbing trains and banks in the American old west, towards the end of the 19th century.This film provides a fine if rather romanticised version of their story, providing excellent cinematic entertainment rather than an accurately documented account.Butch is played by Paul Newman, and Sundance by Robert Redford. Both are outrageously good looking, cool and charismatic and - backed by a fine script - deliver near perfect performances completely suited to the film. Katharine Ross plays Etta, Sundance's love interest and loyal friend.As you would expect, the pair rob people and places and are pursued by various foes and authorities as they do so. In this respect, the film is very simplistic - a couple of outlaws up to no good get into scrapes and gun fights as they're kept on the move by those out to stop them.However the brilliance of the film is in the rogue but loveable nature of the two lead actors, the excellent music score, the sharp and humorous dialogue, and the utterly brilliant cinematography. These combine with artful direction to elevate what might have been just another good western into a much more memorable cinema experience.Throughout this film the scenes are exquisitely crafted, beautifully framed and a real treat to look at and listen to. Even 'ordinary' moments are reimagined and presented creatively - a three way conversation with Sundance and Etta outside while Butch is inside lit through a window for example, or the (fairly lengthy) pursuit scene where the hunting posse are represented by the distant but menacing light from their flaming torches.If you're troubled by law-breakers or killers being turned into likeable folk heroes, or if you're looking for an accurate blow by blow account of the real Butch and Sundance, then you may have reservations with this film.But as a film purely for art and entertainment's sake it succeeds fully - a treat for the eyes and the ears.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Kidding us on,"A nice collection of character scenarios for the two stars to portray their standard screen personas together before climaxing with a well handled and cinematically famous last stand shootout.At no point is it not obvious and perceptible that it is Robert Redford and Paul Newman goofing off of each other and enjoying the opportunities afforded to strut their stuff.I quite enjoy parts of 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' for this reason, however I also find it remarkably unconvincing and unengaging for the very same reason.The film, of course, gains extra credit for it's justly famous climax and a nice goofy and lightly comedic tone permeates almost to the end.If the story was more interesting, or detailed in it's scenarios, and if the characters were more believable I would perhaps enjoy this slightly comedic and persuasive tonality but as it is it sits squarely as a chance to see the two stars in costume and finally going out with a big bang.Overall I consider this to be a great big confidence trick, a hustle, which was directly and explicitly replicated in a subsequent film starring these two together 'The Sting' which benefits from having Robert Shaw for Redford and Newman to play off which makes their characterisations in that film more effective dramatically.I rate a 4/10 and the film is watchable but I wouldn't recommend to general western fans unless you are familiar with either the sub-genre of comedy westerns or with the 60's styling. Also committed fans of the two leads get plenty of time to see them having a lot of japes.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Vietnam"" Western without the My Lai massacre","This is a fantastic movie, no doubt a top ten Western of all time. For somebody like me, who watches a lot of Westerns from the '40's and '50's, it is striking how much more sophisticated this film is in terms of realism, wit, story presentation, editing and soundtrack.Here's what I liked:Two of the best leading men of their generation in their best roles. Maybe the greatest buddy movie ever made.Wonderful integration of comedy and drama.Lots of location shooting in excellent settings.As mentioned above, a very sophisticated production, especially in terms of soundtrack. Story maintains interest throughout, the characters are all consistent, there are only a couple of plot holes, and most importantly, we really care about these two guys.Here's where the movie fell short in a few areas:Even though the supporting cast was good, the movie is so intently Newman/Redford focused, that the other actors don't have much to do. ""Lonsome Dove"", a similar buddy movie, needed to run six hours to develop its supporting cast.The failure to develop a traditional heavy hurts the movie the most. The posse leader is faceless and almost one hundred percent off screen (there's no actor even credited for the role). I get the whole philosophy thing that Butch and Sundance aren't really the ""bad guys"". The ""bad guy"" is the inhuman corporate industrial complex, represented by the railroad and their faceless posse. In that sense, this is a ""Vietnam"" Western with no My Lai massacre. Fair enough, but the execution of the concept hurts the movie dramatically. Every great Western needs a vivid bad guy who's a real character with a real part, meaning dialog and stuff like that.I'm not into the whole anti-hero thing. This movie is a sanitization and glorification of criminality. Notice that they never murder anyone. In fact, you get the impression that no innocent bystander or employee was ever harmed during one of their robberies. Really? (True, the ""square"" corporate railroad employee is injured by the ""cool"" counter- culture bank robbers in the dynamite explosion, but he's just a little bruised up and his injuries are treated as a joke).There are a couple of substantial plot holes during the posse manhunt:1) They appear to be fleeing off into the wilderness to escape the posse. In fact, even Butch admits they don't even know where they are anymore. Yet suddenly they show up in a small town to visit a former friend who is now the town sheriff (very amusingly played by Jeff Corey). They want to negotiate a surrender with the authorities and want their friend to relay the terms. This is confusing, but by itself isn't that big of a plot problem. The real issue is that they arrive in town riding a single horse. Unbelievably, they leave town not only still riding one horse, but without rifles. Earlier Butch was regretting that they didn't have any rifles with which to ambush the posse. Both a horse and rifles would have been easily obtainable in the town.2) It's not so clear why jumping off the cliff into the river was such an automatic passport to salvation. After all, they are now on foot with no food or water and ostensibly very far from civilization. I doubt a working pistol would have survived the soaking in the river, so they probably are without weapons. Even if we swallow the idea that that there is no possible way for ""super posse"" to get down the mountain and catch up to them - even though they are on foot - it's still not clear how they got to the nearest town, or even found it. If it was that easy, wouldn't it have been obvious to the posse where they would go? Wouldn't they be waiting for them there?That was actually the second time that ""super posse"" turned into ""stupid posse"". How did they let Butch and Sundance get away when they were trapped upstairs in the brothel? I mean, they had ten expert killers with guns right outside and these guys were caught by surprise and barely dressed. They went out the back? This is a clever movie. How about a clever plot device to explain their getaway from a hopeless situation?This may sound like nitpicking, but these are sloppy plot holes that could have been easily fixed.The movie is very disrespectful to the country of Bolivia. In fact, I read that it was banned there for a long time. In the finale, are we really supposed to be rooting for these two bank robbers as they mow down young Bolivian army recruits like they are at a shooting gallery on Coney Island?",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"As Far As Westerns Go, This One Probably Tops Them All","Two outlaws rob banks and trains until the heat becomes a little too hot, and they flee to Bolivia where the bank robbing starts all over again.When you're dealing with the team of Paul Newman and Robert Redford, you can pretty much guarantee yourself a quality film. As of this review, the movie was sitting as the #135th of all time. I rated it a little lower than many people, but I don't deny the film's power. Redford and Newman are the Damon and Affleck of their generation.If nothing else, the movie is great because it is now iconic and to really understand many modern films you have to appreciate what this one was. How many movies and shows have duplicated the bike riding scene with Burt Bacharach's ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Dead""? Or Sundance's gun-play? And my all-time favorite movie, ""Mallrats"", does a fine job of adapting the character of LaFours.) The script was written by William Goldman, probably best known for ""The Princess Bride"", but also ""Maverick"". I have no doubt the light humor owes a debt to Goldman.The robberies and such were great, the horse-riding was well-done and very believable. I especially enjoyed the dynamite and the character of Woodcock. And the director's use of angle shots to make the mountains look even more impassable? Superb.Katharine Ross is gorgeous and a strong character who holds her own with the wily bandits.

"A Lot Of Good Things In It, But Overall I Just Didn't Find It That Interesting","Overall I have to confess that in spite of its very high rating this movie didn't really strike a chord with me. It's partly the genre I suppose. I've just never been much into Westerns. Horses and gunfights and saloons have never been of much appeal. Beyond that, though, I simply didn't find the story here to be particularly interesting, nor did I find the movie to be as much fun as a lot of people think it is. I can't give a movie that I don't find interesting a particularly high rating or much of a positive endorsement. Having said all that, though, I do want to acknowledge that it's just my personal bias, and that there's a lot about this movie that I liked in spite of the fact that when it was all put together it didn't appeal to me that much. So, let me offer the positives.First I appreciated the honesty right off the top. There really was a ""Hole in the Wall Gang"" and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were real figures in the Old West as a part of it. The movie follows the basic outline of their life - early bank and train robberies, the escape to Bolivia and the relationship with Etta (Katharine Ross) are all based on reality. But the movie was honest. Instead of saying ""Based on actual events,"" I loved that the opening caption was ""Most of this is true"" - thus acknowledging dramatic licence in a way that most ""based on actual events"" movies don't do. I liked the pairing of Paul Newman (Butch) and Robert Redford (Sundance). They worked very well together and offered pretty good performances in the title roles. The movie did a good job of creating some tension as Butch and Sundance were being pursued by a mysterious posse. The question that kept being asked by Butch (""Who are these guys anyway?"") hung in the air quite well. There were a handful of amusing scenes - especially the train robberies involving Woodcock (George Furth) which I enjoyed. A sense of fun was also created by the use (only once, mind you) of the song ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head."" In one sense, that song seems totally out of sync with the movie, but the scene in which it was used, in which Butch takes Etta for a ride on a bicycle, was a silly, fun scene, and a silly, fun song fit that scene, if not the overall feel of the movie, quite well.But for as much as I liked all that, what I have to keep coming back to is that I just didn't really find the movie to be all that interesting. Just a personal opinion and reaction. Obviously most people disagree with me. (4/10)",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

However I wasn't blown away, expecting a 5 star movie I was instead given (in my opinion) a 4 star one.The film does have fantastic traits, the main being the casting of the two leads; Paul Newman as Butch Cassidy, and Robert Redford as the Sundance Kid. The duo have fantastic chemistry which makes their conversations sizzle with entertainment. By the end of the film you crave for more scenes featuring the two outlaws.George Roy Hill sits in the directors chair and on the whole he does a damn fine job. His most praise-worthy parts being the first scenes and the last. The way he introduces the lead characters is one to admire. I can't mention those scenes without mentioning the DoP's name: Conrad L. Hall. Especially for highlighting the beauty and torment of the West.In terms of the overall plot the film is more of a character study then anything else. I would've loved ""more"" to happen in the middle of the film, but then again this is based on truth. But all in all the screenplay is great, after watching you'll be quoting the movie for the rest of the day.Overall this is an enjoyable Western featuring a stellar cast that'll keep you entertained for the whole 2 hours. Also, that last shot - awesome.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Classic western continues to grow old with dignity,"One of the great westerns, this tale of aging outlaws is a classic in every way; the whole look and feel of the piece reflects the fading glory of Butch and Sundance, their powers slowly waning as their era comes to an end, as well as mirroring the end of the wild sixties era. Redford and Newman are perhaps the greatest double act ever to grace the screen, and though in my personal view inferior to the wonderful Sting, this will always be a great film, a lasting testament to two past ages. Brilliant.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A nice Western.. if you can delete 2 parts of it.,"Yes, the movie is a great one, but I feel that if two small sections had been deleted, there would be far less complaints in this collection of reviews.""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"" was a popular song on the radio, but I think it was way out of place in this film. Then, later on, during the chase by the Bolivian Police, viewers had to suffer through a long and irritating musical production of females voicing bebop gibberish.For my own enjoyment, I duplicated my own DVD of this movie, minus those two irritants, allowing me a far more palatable watch. It is now an 8 instead of a 4.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Classic that holds up in 2014,"I just watched this film again last night on Netflix. The last time that I saw it was in about 1973, when it was broadcast on TV. My mother loved the soundtrack and probably had the hots for Paul Newman and Robert Redford. I fondly remember watching it with her, but I didn't remember all the details of the movie.I was pleasantly surprised at how well it held up. The cinematography is pretty spectacular throughout, so it's easy to understand why it won Best Cinematography in 1970. I was most impressed with the composition of some of the shots. Near the beginning for the movie, when Butch and Sundance come together, the steady shot on Sundance and the cropped shot of his rival card player, really give a great sense of tension.There are some good laughs and some good action, along with a bit of a love story. Be sure to notice the long blonde haired girl that Newman takes upstairs when they're hiding out in the town. It's one of the first film appearances of Cloris Leachman.The soundtrack doesn't hold up quite as well, except for the award winning song ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head."" Some of the Bacharach tunes with the multiple voices going Doo Be Doo just seem a little out of place. I'm not sure who else was up for Best Original Score, but I think that Raindrops must have swayed the decision.If you like today's George Clooney and Brad Pitt movies, you'll enjoy this classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
More comedy than western,"Could never understand why it is considered a classic western since it is more of a comedy in a western setting. I put it in the class with ""Support Your Local Sheriff/Gunfighter"" ""The Halileua Trail"" and ""Cat Balou"" . But for some folks I suppose this was their idea of a good western. It is a funny comedy. It did lack for the classic cliche mud puddle fight.Perhaps the chemistry of Redford and Newman made it as popular as it was at the time. It sketched the story of Butch Cassidy and the Hole in the Wall Gang just barely, and it would be nice to see a gritty retelling of their story.The ""Raindrops"" sequence didn't fit at all, for the western genre but if you view it as a comedy then maybe.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Paul Newman And Robert Redford Make An Excellent Team,"Any film that would put Paul Newman and Robert Redford together may sound miscast but the results have twice proven to be pure box office magic. In their first teaming, Newman and Redford portray the two legendary outlaws whose many adventures during the early 1900's are sometimes comedic, sometimes dramatic and sometimes dangerous. This late 1960's classic was one of the earliest examples of the enjoyable modern day buddy films. The chemistry between Newman and Redford was so successful that four years later, they made another film together ""The Sting"" which was an Academy Award winner for Best Picture. However, this film was nominated for Best Picture too setting a new precedent for film duo teamings.",,Anonymous,Biography
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance kid,"I absolutely loved this film, it was interesting and comical but it also told the history behind it. It explains why they do what they do and how they did it and how and why they died.

Stars Shine,"This phenomenally successful Western about lovable bank robbers made Redford into a star and spawned a drove of buddy-buddy movies. The main attraction here is the chemistry and the witty banter between Newman and Redford, which is so enjoyable that it makes up for Hill's pretentious direction. Ross's role is so inconsequential that she shouldn't have bothered to show up. The plot is very thin and the film has little rhythm to it. The ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"" sequence is silly, and the long montage of still pictures before they head to Bolivia kills the film's momentum. This film is the antithesis of ""The Wild Bunch,"" the great Western released the same year.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
I love me some romanticized western but god,"Did this cross the line and then some. It looks beyond fake, staged and cheap even for its time.The cast is ridiculous to say the least, I understand Newman was partly behind the production. According to Hollywood all historically notable people who ever lived were handsome pretty boys. I bet when they come up with a remake which shouldn't take long, they'll try to cast DiCaprio who apparently resembles every notable character who ever lived and some other pretty eyes boy.The release date for this along other overrated films turned out to be instances of perfect timing, apparently the 60's were perfect or something.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A great, entertaining Western yarn.","Back in the day, this was a huge block buster of a Western. Combining two mega superstars, who bring this relatively simple (yet exciting) action adventure alive. Using a contemporary musical soundtrack, it's certainly a more lighthearted look at these iconic, 'Wild West' heroes. Ironically released in the same year as 'The Wild Bunch'.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Script is what holds it together,"This is one of the greatest films ever made. And I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that.
Think of this as a Western for people who don't like Westerns. I see it more like an action, an adventure, a thriller, a comedy, a romance and a drama all rolled into one.
What holds it all together is the fantastic script. The way that it creates tension whilst maintaining a jovial tone is something to be admired. The chemistry between the two leads, enhanced by the fantastic performances of Newman and Redford, is like nothing you see in most buddy comedies giving them great banter to work from and a 'show don't tell' way of describing the long history they have shared together. They are robbers trying to fund their hedonistic lifestyle and yet you're still cheering them on! The way that the story is structured is also very smart, with the first act not dragging on too long and setting up the environment, the tone and the characters nicely; the second act intensifying their conflict and creating doubt in us, the audience, as to whether or not they will succeed in what they do; and the third act giving us a showdown like no other.
Top that off with great cinematography, fantastic music (and not just the memorable and catchy 'Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head') and editing that is not too fast and not too slow and this is a now fifty years old classic that has aged like very fine wine.

Caring for Cassidy and The Kid...,"BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID was the first western I saw in a theater as a kid (during its re-release) and it blew me away. The contemporary attitudes of the two leads and the relative realism of the action that was depicted were two of the things that really stood out at the time (older westerns rarely if ever risked attempts at the kind of self-deprecating humor that Paul Newman engages in throughout the movie). When Robert Redford's eyes lock onto his accuser's gun during the opening confrontation, it's enough to establish his character's single-mindedness (and potential for violence at any moment); it's a great little touch and it's just one of many throughout the movie. Unlike all too many westerns, BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID makes us CARE about these two characters (rogues though they may be) and it's THAT carefully-cultivated caring that makes the ending all the more poignant.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

tale based on real guys,"Redford and newman! This won four oscars...it's really pretty good! Butch and sundance have been robbing banks and trains. And now there's a posse hired by the train company coming after them. And it's not giving up. So butch, sundance, and his girl head for south america. They pull more jobs, but now there's an even bigger posse after them. Theoretically based on the true activities of the elusive ""hole in the wall"" gang, this is all described in detail in wikipedia. It's all well done, and was a huge success at the box office. Lots of fun banter between butch and sundance. I'm not sure what the significance of the long bicycle ride was, but it sure killed a lot of time. And several of the songs were so light and fluffy, making this (almost) a happy go lucky story of bank robbers. Directed by george hill. He also directed them in the sting. Script by william goldman. Reading the various stories of the on set antics between the uptight director and the cast could have been another whole film itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
So-so star vehicle doesn't hold up,"I was a kid when this came out, but only just saw it for the first time. Having heard all my life it was one of the great movies, I'm pretty disappointed.It's an okay ""buddy film"" focussing on two big movie stars, but I suspect their fame and star quality makes people think the film is better than it is.The escape from pursuers part works well enough, although there is little suspense and no real plot twists. The personal side doesn't work at all. Butch and the Kid banter and bicker mildly but their relationship doesn't change or develop or get more interesting. Famous scenes, like the one where Newman kicks the big brute in the balls, fall flat, maybe because they've been so often imitated, and since half the movies made since then have some guy kicked in the balls. For every scene that lands, like the fine one where they're forced to choose between capture and jumping off a cliff, there are several that don't.Poor Katherine Ross's role is thankless and dull. She just stands there, blank-faced, passively agreeing to do whatever the guys tell her. WIth few lines to speak, she never really enters into the story or affects it. It doesn't help that Ross lacks charisma and her face and voice are inexpressive. It feels like she's barely in the movie. A love triangle hinted at early on, which could have made her character interesting, is a red herring. Her character goes nowhere. She's meaninglessly there and then meaninglessly not there.The lengthy sepia montages in the beginning and middle eat up screen time and add nothing beyond the dubious pleasure of watching movie stars look cute, smiling and riding carnival rides. Even the robberies are cursory and repetetive, aside from the fine scene where they use too much dynamite on a train.The movie's worst aspect may be Burt Bacharach's incredibly inappropriate, facetious and annoying music. Did it seem innovative in 1969? The BA-DI-DI-DI-DAH chorus that babbles endlessly over yet another unnecessary wordless montage may be the most irritating and flagrantly wrong musical scoring in Hollywood history. With Bacharach's sterling track record, you wonder how he could have gone so wrong in this film.I'm guessing this film was overrated like a much worse movie was last year, the staggeringly dull and pointless ONCE UPON A TIME IN HOLLYWOOD, because the presence of two big charismatic male stars blinded many viewers to the weakness of the project.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

3 great westerns in 1969,"The year 1969 may have been the greatest one for westerns ever. We had ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", ""The Wild Bunch"" and ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"". The last one has Paul Newman in one of his coolest roles ever, with Robert Redford showing the flair for acting that he would soon bring to many other flicks. That scene on the cliff is really something else, as is the movie's final scene.There are some scenes in the movie that look sort of like they were thrown in for comic relief. There's the bicycle scene and the first time that they try to rob a bank in Bolivia. But overall, this is truly a great movie.It's weird to think that I only saw this movie a few weeks after I first learned of Paul Newman's existence (from the movie ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand""). My mom said that when she saw it when it first came out, she thought for about a minute that a certain scene involved a rape. But anyway, it's a movie that you gotta see.

"Wistful, longing, envious","I could say so much about how wonderfully crafted this movie is, from the golden cinematography, to the witty writing, to the beautifully understated acting. But ultimately I judge a movie by how it leaves me feeling after I'm done watching. This is not a traditional western, with the black-and-white, good guy vs bad guy, rooting for justice to be served, with the cavalry or some other force to save the day. It is not just a buddy movie, with good times and comic moments. It is, in my mind, quite an original movie. This movie leaves me wistful, wishing for some golden sepia-toned moments of my own. Longing for a chance at adventure and a relatively care-free life; as a previous reviewer stated perfectly, these boys are middle-aged adolescents, unwilling or unable to grow up. Some of us (not everyone) will be envious of these boys and the life they chose and were able to lead, in defiance of the expected convention. Some of us will feel that wistful longing for a golden time: the closest comparison I can think of is listening to that opening song on Cheers, wanting to find a cozy place that perhaps doesn't really exist for many of us. I did not feel thrilled, I did not feel chilled, I did not feel elated. But I did feel...and I'm willing to feel that way again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gets better every time,"I recently wathched this movie for the third time and found it to be a better movie than the last time I saw it. This is unique because I usually am not able to sit through a movie I have already wathced. I believe that Redford and Newman each gave career performances which were infinitely helped by an excellent performance from Katherine Ross.This movie does move at a slow pace at times, but has its fine points as well. The New York vignette has always been a movie magic piece in my mind and really helped to move the movie along from the overdone chase scene to the trip to Bolivia. The scene in which Butch confronts Logan for group leadership is also a personal favourite of mine. Perhaps the best part of the movie is the final shoot-out in which Butch and Sundance discuss ways to get away and what to do after even though they know they are going to go out in a blaze of glory.This movie could almost be considered a comedy rather than a western because of its melodramatic script and the fact that the viewer never gets to meet ""Those Guys"".

A Perfect Film That Stands The Test Of Time,"I have finally come to realize what all the hoopla was about and don't know what took me so long! I have recently seen Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid and I don't think I'll ever forget it. This movie simply blew me away and, even though it's from the 60's, the film is just as fresh and relevant today and certainly holds up to any Western produced since. (I hesitate to even call it a Western either - it has more wit than most ""comedies"" I've seen lately.)What made this movie so great for me is the undeniable chemistry between our outlaws, Newman & Redford - it's absolute perfection. This is one of the all time greatest 'buddy' films I have ever seen - you'll definitely be rooting for 'the bad guys'! The characters are so endearing and so real that I could not believe they were acting. Nothing feels forced or even scripted, it's just naturally one great ride!One of my personal favourite features of this movie is the way George Roy Hill chose to shoot the 'possey' that is sent after our two main characters - he makes the film that much better by choosing to shoot long sweeping scenes which prove highly effective. Even more intriguing is how there are several shots throughout the film where the characters are seen through objects and not always dead on (like through fences or window panes, etc). It gave me the feeling of being a voyeur instead of right there with them; which is a somewhat new feeling that I really enjoyed. Hill is an excellent story teller and I simply did not want this picture to end.Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid is sure to please any movie lover despite age or favourite genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A historically important film on male bonding.,"A historically important film on male bonding.This is one of the first Western Films where male bonding was glorified, though there were others earlier than this, I believe this movie got two men together who were bonded thick and thin. The chemistry between Butch Cassidy played by Paul Newman and the Sundance Kid played by Robert Redford is amazing. Without the chemistry, I am sure the film would not have worked and would not have stood the test of time.I am watching it now after a couple of earlier viewings and today too, I felt the bonding of these guys so enticing and charming. The climax where the cover and run are done, is a testimony of what they stand for. Now having said that, the film is not all too good, sweet and nice, there are some sour moments (if not bitter) and they are given to us by uncalled for heists, and a bit of drama to get the girl too. Katherine Ross plays the female character of Etta Place. Though she does here role well, she acts as a kind of spoilsport between our two heroes and it kind of irked me. I saw it as an uncalled for aberration in another wise wonderful film.I liked the cinematography, the color correction, the art direction and even the writing for a good part of the time. The sepia toning done as part of cool correction is wonderful too. It gave an authentic, earthy feeling which is essential for the film. Now, the editing I wish could have been crisp. There is a fight in the beginning that's witty and charm and as the film spans it's length the charm fades and that's the sad part of the film.I wish it would have had more witty moments than it actually did, the second half or later hour felt monotonous too. So, I am OK with what I got and wish it could have been so much better. I am going with 4/5 for this film, just for the sheer repeat value it has got for me that I felt low, so I need a friendship film, I get to this and I got back to this film third time. It implies there is some greatness affiliated to it as per me.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Still Great Contemporary-Feeling Western Classic in a Robust DVD Package Heavy on Extras,"It amazes me how incredibly well this 1969 western has held up after all these years. At once classically structured and satirically executed, director George Roy Hill and screenwriter William Goldman have pulled together a supremely entertaining period picture that caters to contemporary sensibilities to this day. It is to their credit that the film remains true to the characters and never gets too broad during its quickly paced 110-minute running time. The story naturally revolves around the legendary outlaws who robbed banks at the turn of the last century. Their escapades are divided roughly into three sections in the film. The first is the introductory set-up where their opposite yet complementary personalities are established. Leading the motley Hole in the Wall Gang, they ultimately pull off a train robbery with an excess of dynamite. The second part is an extended chase sequence where Butch and Sundance are chased relentlessly by a group of unknown bounty hunters.The third and final part details their escape to Bolivia where they are determined to go straight but get caught up with local bandits and find their infamous past catching up with them. It seems inconceivable to have anyone other than Paul Newman and Robert Redford in the title roles. As the more established star at the time, Newman is characteristically laconic as Butch. His innate likability is enhanced by his rascally manner and crack comedy timing. In the more traditional gunslinger role, Redford provides the ideal partner with his flinty manner and unavoidable charisma. In between them is Katharine Ross, fresh from ""The Graduate"", who plays Etta with sensual élan, though she does not figure in the most critical scenes. Of course, Burt Bacharach's instantly recognizable musical score is here, and while there is an anachronistic feel to such 1960's-sounding pop music over a western, it somehow works because the attitude of the film seems so modern. Even the comically romantic bicycle sequence manages to preserve its buoyancy thanks to the inane but undeniably catchy ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head"".Conrad Hall's vibrant, burnished cinematography deserves special mention as it has been preserved well in the 2006 Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD package. The rest of the two-disc package is robust though bordering on overkill, adding on to the features that were already included in the previous 2000 Special Edition DVD. Retained from that edition is the interesting combination of perspectives provided by Hill, Hall, lyricist Hal David and associate producer Bob Crawford in their joint commentary track. New is separate and equally insightful commentary from Goldman. Another holdover from the previous edition is the forty-minute vintage documentary, ""The Making of Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid"", a still terrific featurette from 1970 with participation from Newman, Goldman, Hill and Redford.There are three new documentaries - a 2005 retrospective look at the film called ""All of What Follows is True: The Making of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid""; a fact-check featurette called ""The Wild Bunch: The True Tale of Butch & Sundance""; and the somewhat repetitive ""History Through the Lens: Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid: Outlaws Out of Time"", a cumulative effort which combines elements of all the other documentaries into one ninety-minute feature. Lots of great insight is provided on the 1994 interviews with Newman, Redford, Ross, Goldman and Bacharach. A deleted scene is also included with Hill's commentary (since the audio had been lost) - it is a disposable transitional scene where Butch and Sundance are watching newsreel footage of themselves in a Bolivian theater while Etta quietly leaves to the train station. Lastly, there are trailers for eight of Newman's vintage films. This is definitely a robust package for one of the great films of the 1960's.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Can a Pair of Buddies maintain their membership in a Gang of Bank and Train Robbers and still be regular Citizens? and, Just where is Bolivia?","We can well remember seeing a television special about the making of BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID (1969). It was some years ago, probably in the late 1970's and was very informative to a really uninitiated kid like myself. In an interview with the screenwriter, William Goldman, he revealed much about the motivation in writing the story and the intricacies of putting together a story part fiction, part legend, part true happenings.Mr. Goldman said that while there had been countless numbers of screenplays and movies about Jesse James, but not one had been written about Butch and Sundance. He had set out to do something about that. It would appear that now, after nearly forty years, that he had succeeded.From the very start, it became apparent that the story would certainly be something that was very different. Whereas there seemed to be certain criteria unofficially established to render a story a ""Western"", Goldman, while keeping all this in mind, struck out in another direction. He gave the two outlaws full three dimensional personalities, idiosyncrasies, virtues and foibles. In short, they were rendered ""human"", or as close as a filmed characterization could come.Starting off the story in ""town"", where Butch Cassidy(Paul Newman) is obviously casing the joint in planning a future job. He observes changes at the town's bank. There are more locks, a guard is on duty at all times during business hours. The establishment closes promptly at 2 O'Clock closing time. ""What happened to the old bank?"", Butch laments. ""It was beautiful!"" ""People kept robbing it."", matter-of-factly replies the Bank Guard.Just down the street a piece sat the Sundance Kid, busily engaged in a mid-afternoon Poker Game. Sundance has been winning, and exception is taken to the fact by one of his opponents. Accusing Sundance of cheating, and threatening him with harm, standing and making it obvious that he would draw and fire at the Kid, if he didn't leave the money on the table and vacate the establishment.Butch enters and observes that there was a short supply of brotherly love at the Poker Table. Butch attempts to mediate the dispute. Sundance is as vehement about his innocence as his accuser was about his accusation of cheating. Arriving at the conclusion that his peace making is getting nowhere, Butch 'throws in the towel' with the final remark, ""I can't help you, Sundance!"" News of his opponent's being the Sundance Kid brings a sobering effect on the accuser. ""I didn't know you were the Sundance Kid when I said you were cheating!"", was his next remark, as he acquiesced to Butch's request to invite Subdance to stay, which he didn't. The two then ride away from town toward their hide out at 'Hole in the Wall'.This entire opening sequence was filmed in a sort of old fashioned Sepia Toned print. It is a process which is not color, nor is it Black & White. It was very effectively used, a real grabber to the audience.The effect was further amplified by use of a succession of close-ups. Eyes, clocks, locks, latches and faces all take their turn in being essayed by the camera lense's revealing encounters.As the pair rides off from town to their rendezvous with the Gang, the presence of full-color film fades onto the screen. It was a well planned and executed gimmick to grab hold that audience's attention.From then on, we follow the exploits of the Whole in the Wall Gang, its internal disputes, internal politics, etc. We also find out that an all star posse of specially hired lawmen whose only object was to hunt down and kill Butch and Sundance.Oh, and of all the fine performances turned in by suppoprting players, we must make mention of three in particular. They are: Kenneth Mars as the long-winded, short on influence town Marshall, Struther Martin as Percy Garris, American Mining Company Boss in Bolivia, and Jeff Corry as Marshall Ray Bledsoe, whose performance was absolutely pivotal.It was about this very point that Author Goldman said that he had gotten the most grief from ""the Suits"" at 20th Century-Fox. After all, the outlaw pair leave the good old USA for the mining country in Bolivia. Now, no real American would do a thing like that, not even an American Outlaw! But, alas they did do that thing! That old TV special, previously mentioned, did reveal a lot about parts of the film that were excised from the full body of the work. This served as enlightenment about some aspects of the movie that we had been wondering about.For example take the very elaborate opening credits scenes depicting a train robbery by ""The Whole in the Wall Gang"" as shown by the Thomas Edison Company.(all shown as the Burt Bacharach original Film Score starts in, slowly at first with a couple of Piano keys.) Why such extravagance for opening credits? As it turns out, the depiction of the silent film was from a deleted scene that had the Trio (Butch, Sundance and Etta) viewing a primitive Edison film in a Bolivian City. This was supposed to have actually happened! And the guys were very angry 'cause the Edison Co. Director got it all wrong!This would seem to be a trait that is all too common, even today!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
What could possibly go wrong?,"I wanted to like this film. I'd seen clips, I knew the music, knew the screenwriter's works, I knew this had to be one of best films of all time. And then I sat down to watch it. I don't know what let it down. The script was brilliant. Acting? Hardly, well written, well acted, well filmed. I think it was the costuming that screamed ""This is the 1960's...!"" and the make up....same thing. After fifteen minutes of this I switched it off. I wish I'd never watched it, the film I thought it would be was so much better. If you aren't bothered by continuity errors (such as wardrobe and makeup not giving a fig about what people wore in a historical era) I'm sure you'll find it entertaining. I'm a historian and it bothers me, intensely. Yes, I'm sure if I drank a lot of alcoholic beverages and watched it again, I'd find it has lots allegory...but until then, no. I didn't like it.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
The best of Paul Newman-Robert Redford duo!,"Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid had got to be the coolest western crime movie I ever seen in 60s. It got the wits, the crime, the drama and adventure! Paul Newman and Robert Redford were equally the best in their roles. Though honestly ""The Sting"" was incontestably very good as well, this film out reigns the latter for me. Katharine Ross, which appeared later wasn't bad as well. The most captivating was of course the story. However the story wasn't materialized well to its depths if Paul Newman and Robert Redford, two legendary actors had pulled the trick. They were really good in portraying the characters. And to convince you, the real sister of Butch Cassidy (in real life) appreciated well how Paul Newman played the character well. Robert Redford on the other hand was superbly brilliant and cool as well. This is the first movie I saw him playing western. Butch had the brains, Sundance got the action. They mixed well and we see a great movie. Most of the time being enthralled, I got most of the laughs the comedy the two naturally performed. Very good film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Kid, the next time I say, ""Let's go someplace like Bolivia,"" let's go someplace like Bolivia""- 45 years of a great western classic","45 years ago, there were two westerns that came out in 1969. One was popular. One was not so popular. The one that was popular with audiences was Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The one that wasn't popular with audiences was The Wild Bunch. The Wild Bunch made it to my Top 10 favorite list. But, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was also in the same league as The Wild Bunch. What more can you ask for this picture? Not a whole lot. The story of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is not really true to what happen to the duo, but the movie is sort of a fictional dramatization of the two bank robbers. The movie begins with Butch, (Paul Newman), entering a bank that already starting to close up for the day. It's the 1890's, there's not much left for the world for bandits. Butch loses his chance to rob the bank, however. Meanwhile, his friend, The Sundance Kid,(Robert Redford), is playing a card game with two other men. The big man behind the card game suspects Sundance is cheating. Sundance denies this. To prove that he is the quickest gun around, he demonstrates his talent by shooting the big man's gun out of his hand. The duo then head out of town to meet the Hole-In-The-Wall gang, which is what Butch Cassidy's gang is called, even though realistically, the real Butch Cassidy's gang was called the Wild Bunch. They have already been selected to work with Harvey (Ted Cassidy), instead of Butch. After beating up Harvey, Butch, the Sundance Kid, and the other gang members, decide to rob a train by blowing up one of the train's boxcars. It turns out that the man who is hiding in the boxcar that they have blown up works for E.H. Harriman of the Union Pacific Railroad. But, when a posse of lawmen show up unexpectedly at their robbery, Butch and the Sundance Kid decides that they have no choice but to run from the law. The movie also develop an relationship between the two men and a woman named Etta Place (Katherine Ross). In one particular scene in the movie, Butch and Etta shared a joyful and somewhat sweet moment together as Butch rides a bicycle to the tune of ""Raindrops are Falling On My Head."", sung by Burt Bacharach. That scene works very well because it shows just how joyful it is to watch this movie. When the law becomes too close to bear on, the trio decides to travel to Bolivia, where they are bound to rob banks. They do get lucky, however. Yet, both Butch and Sundance know that their times are closing up for the both of them. Time is short and banks are going for broke. There isn't much more to go around for. The finale of the movie takes place in a plaza, where Butch and Sundance face off against the Bolivian army, who is waiting outside. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a fun and funny western. It has the charm and wisdom that is fueled by both Paul Newman's and Robert Redford's performances. They like each other in this movie and we like them together. In my opinion, there are probably the best movie buddies since Mel Gibson and Danny Glover team up together in Lethal Weapon. Another reason why this also works in a beautiful way is the cinematography. The cinematography is rich and colorful, with breath-taking shots of canyons and riverbeds. Furthermore, the cinematographer, Conrad L. Hall, won a Oscar for his work in this film. The picture is very good-looking and very beautiful to watch. To me, the movie is sort of a softer version of The Wild Bunch. The reason why is because in The Wild Bunch, there was a hard edge to the story and the characters. It was a lot more violent than this one. This one isn't as violent as The Wild Bunch. In fact, both movies succeeds in making the western genre more pure. The screenplay for this movie is very well-written with funny dialogue in between drastic situations in which Butch and Sundance must figure out a way to elude the Bolivian army. In one particular scene and the most famous scene in the movie is when Butch and Sundance are trapped on a cliff. Below them is a raging river stream. Sundance wants to fight them. But, Butch, keeping a cool head, decide that they should jump into the river. With Butch trying to egg Sundance to jump, Sundance leaves no choice, but to jump into the river. Even the longest curse word ever said in the movie is also heard. A lot of people like this movie, yet there are some who didn't like. I like to know why they didn't like it. It is because of the charm? It is because of the chemistry between Newman and Redford? Is the movie classic in it's own right? I specifically don't know or how anyone would hate this movie. It is a classic. I enjoy so much of what went on during the whole movie. It was fun. It was funny. It was thrilling. It was tragic toward the end. But, above all, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid continues to be one of the best westerns around. It is also one of the best movies of 1969. As for the buddy genre, it would be qualified as being the best buddy movie ever made. Why? Because Newman and Redford are likable throughout this movie. Whether they have to jump into the river or try to rob a Bolivian bank and also command the tellers and people in the bank to put their hands up in Spanish, it all works very well. It's supposed to be enjoyable. Even after 45 years, it still keep on chugging away. ★★★★ 4 stars.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great western,"9+Wonderful - Redford was great.Loved the chase scene - really epic they don't do these anymore - sadAlso the over the top gang was wonderful - train sequence amazing It is in a class all its own, courtesy of George Roy Hill, Paul Newman, Robert Redford, Conrad Hall, and, of course, Burt Bacharach, who won the Academy Award for best score.The obvious story is that of the two ""aging bandits"" (their not really either), who escape from the law. There are those memorable moments, such as the train robbery with a little too much dynamite (and the employee of Mr. E. H. Harriman), the chase into the rocks (""Who are those guys?""), and the ""straight"" job working for a mine in Bolivia (and the owner who really loves his tobacco).But the more subtle draw to the story, in my opinion, is the legend behind it. There are little points made like ""Most of What Follows Is True"", but the biggest point is made in the last still frame. Sure we see them run out, and sure we hear the Bolivian captain yell ""Fire!"", but can you really say they are killed? Remember, these guys are the two-bit legends of the west, resourcful in all they do. That is the beauty of this film-they're real, but not over-the-top real.The cinematography is absolutely magnificant (point-in-case: the bicycle seen where the camera is on the other side of an old fence, allowing some light to be seen), the music is poignant and appropriat.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Great Western and One of the Best Buddy Comedies Ever Made,"Ever since I first saw it as a child, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid has always been one of my favorite movies. It was such a different take on the old west and life of an outlaw than I'd seen before, or that anyone had seen for that matter. More playful than even John Ford's most light hearted works, but without the sappiness of the old singing cowboy comedies, it made the west seem like not only a grand adventure, but also great fun. With its oddball sense of humor and the interplay between its two stars, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is both a great western and perhaps the best buddy comedy Hollywood ever made.As the title suggests, the film follows the exploits of two of the Wild West's most infamous outlaws, who with their Hole in the Wall Gang robbed banks and trains far and wide, earning themselves a reputation as some of the move dangerous men alive. But you'd never know it if you met them. Far from hardened outlaws, Butch and Sundance are friendly, laid back cutups who find enjoyment where they can and never take life too seriously. Charming to a fault, they're even nice to the people they're robbing. They're not really bad men you see; they just have expensive tastes and a strong aversion to hard work.Whether it's a narrow getaway, a stick up, or a friendly visit to the nearest brothel, everything they touch becomes good natured fun, and it all works because of the men playing them. Hiring Paul Newman and then newcomer Robert Redford as Butch and Sundance was one the great happy coincidences in Hollywood history, like casting Ingrid Bergman opposite Humphrey Bogart, and began an on screen partnership even more enduring. The chemistry between these men is incredible; even knowing this was their first film together it's hard to believe they hadn't known each other all their lives.On their own each man has exceptional wit and charisma. Together they're the perfect comedic duo; Butch the talkative joker, Sundance the tight lipped strait man. Never overplaying their shtick, they always lay on just the right amount of humor. When times are good they're like a pair of schoolboys playing hooky. When times are bad they're worse than an old married couple.Of course not all the credit goes to the actors. The director and the screenplay are crucial to the film's ability to keep its cheery tone. Even when Butch and Sundance are running for their lives, hounded by the best lawmen and trackers in the west, it's no reason for things to get serious. Now they're just a couple of saps who can't catch a break, leading them to a harebrained stunt that remains one of the screen's great moments of physical comedy.Much of the film's humor and charm come from its dialogue, yet at times it accomplishes a great amount with no words at all. The New York montage condenses the story of their fun in the big city and their departure for South America into a few brief moments, the series of black and white stills and old timey waltzes and carnival music wonderfully evocative of the period. An entire string of Bolivian robberies likewise becomes a cheerful musical interlude.And speaking of musical interludes, the whole movie is so carefree and delightfully screwball that it even manages to make the dreaded Semi-Obligatory Lyrical Interlude- in which lover's engage in pleasant activities that have nothing to do with the plot- work. Rationally there's no reason why a scene of Paul Newman riding a bicycle with a woman we've just met should follow a train robbery, but here it's so charming that we either forget that or just don't car. There's simply something magical about watching Newman and Katherine Ross peddling around that meadow, and his wordless 'daredevil' scene is the best thing since Buster Keaton.Yet the good times can't last forever, certainly not for men in their line of work. The fact is that the world they know is passing away. The Wild West isn't as wild as it used to be, and their profession is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. They realize this and go halfway around the world to a place that's still wild and lawless in an attempt to forestall it. It works for a while, but it's only so long before their past starts to catch up with them. In the blink of an eye things turn deadly serious, and we realize that the world's closing in on them and they can't escape it, no matter how far they go. In the end Butch and Sundance died as they lived; on their own terms, as outlaws, and following no-one's rules but their own.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

George Roy Hill Directs A Winner,"George Roy Hill is a director who directed around 20 films, a majority of them involving either Paul Newman or Robert Redford. When he got a great script to work with like this one, and The Sting, he directed great films. When the script was not quite as good, he didn't do as well to raise the effort as with Redford in The Great Waldo Pepper.This film based upon the real Hole in The Wall gang story is lavishly treated here and the story is a winner. The triangle of Redford-Newman & Katherine Ross is exploited magnificently & this film is one of the better of the westerns of the late 1960's though there are a lot of great westerns that seemed to come out in the 1960's.If your a fan of westerns, this one holds up next to classics like The Wild Bunch and some others. This film has more fluff than the former, but it still is a classic in many ways on it's own.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A classic, of course.","It's hard to know what to add, when a movie's already as beloved and talked about as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It's undeniably one of the best American Westerns of all time, and though it feels breezy and relaxed for much of its runtime, it also never feels slow or stagnant. It feels like it moves fast but is never in a rush, and it makes for a film that's really easy to get absorbed in (I could almost watch the two main characters escape that posse that was after them in real time).You pair two of the biggest stars of their generation, give them a wonderful screenplay, through in some iconic music, and film it all beautifully, and I guess it all equals up to a classic like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It really is that good.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Extremely Original!,"Robert Ebert wrote ""William Goldman's script is constantly too cute and never gets up the nerve, by God, to admit it's a Western."", I think he's right, but the thing is, they didn't try to make an old school western movies, they mixed western with Chaplin's comedy, and buddy movie, making the result, entertainment itself.It's the story of Butch(Newman) and Sundance(Redford), the two leaders of the Hole-in-the-Wall Gang. Butch is all ideas, Sundance is all action and skill. The west is becoming civilized and when Butch and Sundance rob a train once too often, a special posse begins trailing them no matter where they run. Over rock, through towns, across rivers, the group is always just behind them. When they finally escape through sheer luck, Butch has another idea, ""Let's go to Bolivia!"".Imagine Sergio Leone's movies mixed with ""Lethal Weapon"", and than you have something close to this movie, but the truth is, this movie is original, and I can't think about another movie that look like this one. In the beginning credits, they made a tribute to old Westerns, and what I understood about it is that they were trying to say, ""We admire the old Westerns, and those classics inspired us, but we're making something a little bit different, out of what you guys created, alright?"".Sometimes they even used Chaplin's kind of humor to entertain you, like the scene of Butch riding the bicycle, and it worked, I laughed more in this movie than in a lot of comedy movies, and not only bad ones. The first part of it was concentrated more in the laughs and showing how close those two guys really are(Note the intimacy between Butch and Etta, Kid's wife). The second part is a little slower, and the rhythm falls a little bit, not that it's bad, it's great, but it's hard to make the second part as good as its incredible first part. The photography is great, but not different than the other Westerns.The Acting is splendid, Newman is one of the best actors of all time, and he proves it again in this one, he's charismatic and funny, unlike Redford's equally great performance, that makes his character darker, and hesitant about his actions. But the most important element of the acting in the picture, is the chemistry between those two actors, which made all the situations more believable, and the ending more striking, plus it's incredibly funny to watch them arguing.Verdict: When this movie ends, you'll want more, because it's entertaining and funny, in a way that you don't see a lot these days, plus the performances by the two leads are brilliant",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bosom Buddies,"The ultimate ""buddy"" movie.Buddy movies were all over the place in 1969 in various guises -- this, ""Midnight Cowboy,"" ""The Wild Bunch,"" ""Easy Rider."" ""Butch Cassidy"" is the lightest and most accessible of these -- for that reason, I don't think it's as interesting to look at now as these other movies are. But it does serve up a dose of good old-fashioned Hollywood film-making, and in Paul Newman and Robert Redford, it presented audiences with a cinema duo as memorable as that of Laurel and Hardy or Abbott and Costello, or if you prefer a more contemporary example, Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, who had manufactured a similar screen chemistry the year before in ""The Odd Couple.""""Butch and Sundance"" is mostly a nostalgic comedy, harking back to the glory days of screen westerns. But for all its levity, there is something dark about it that's hard to describe. Butch and Sundance are anti-heroes in the same way that Bonnie and Clyde were in Arthur Penn's brilliant film -- they've got the glamour of Hollywood movie stars, but their doom is sealed from the second the film starts, and because they're so likable and charismatic, it makes it that much more upsetting to see them destroyed. Like Bonnie and Clyde, Butch and Sundance find themselves unable to exist in a world intent on their destruction -- in this way, the film comments both on the death of the traditional western, and on the alienated restlessness of an entire younger generation that was beginning to make itself heard in American cinema.Also starring Katharine Ross as the third point in a love triangle, and featuring one of the best film songs ever recorded, ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head,"" which accompanies Paul Newman as he shows off for Ross on a bicycle in one of the movie's highlights.Grade: A-",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Both great at what they do, hold up banks and trains, they realize it is downright time they move on especially since the law is not starting to look as lame as it used to on this side of the continent no more. They are being chased by who I believe are their old gang members, but one can't tell. They both like to spend their money on booze, brothels, good food and finish it that way and have to start from scratch every single time.

One of the best Westerns of All Time..,"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid redefined the American expectation of the Western. Shunning the stereotypical John Wayne classics of years before, BC&SK showcased two of the greatest outlaws of the American West in a gritty, humorous, realistic fashion. To this day (with handful of exceptions, such as the now-corny extended bicycle riding sequence) this movie stands up to the 90's in terms of wit, realism, violence, and humor. It's all all around entertaining movie made perfect with the flawless performance of Paul Newman as Butch and Robert Redford as the Sundance Kid.Displayed afresh in stunning digitally perfect, color-enhanced DVD, BC&SK is the paramount Western. Forget the old washed out, circa 1984 video store rental VHS pan-and-scan. This latest widescreen release is more vibrant and spectacular than ever. Subtelty is in the form of Redford's excellent exasperated facial expressions, Newman's charming eye-brow raises when he delivers the perfect wit, and the beautiful southwest landscapes.

Great film,"I used to think the chase part went on too long, but now I just sit back and enjoy the banter, and the gorgeous scenery. (I don't know where Conrad Hall shot this picture, but I have a hard time believing it was anywhere on Planet Earth.) Nothing else to complain about with this one, nothing.Obviously the most appealing aspect of this film are the two leads. Its a happy miracle that with all the big names being bandied around, we ended up with Newman and Robert Redford. Warren Beatty and Steve McQueen wouldn't have worked not because of inferior acting skills but inferior chemistry. Newman and Redford work so well with each other because they aren't competing but playing off each other. They are actors, and they have egos, but there's no stench of narcissism connected to this movie. That's why it's so enjoyable even through the slow stretches, and why it's a shame Newman and Redford only did one other movie together after this.George Roy Hill directed that movie, ""The Sting,"" as well as this, and it's bewildering how little credit he seems to get for his work.

Well, it is kinda nice seeing a younger Paul Newman and a young Robert Redford playing with each other.  Their characters are neat--a wisecracking Paul Newman, and a silent but wise Robert Redford.  The chemistry is terrific. But Katherine Ross adds up to zero in this flick.  She's got nothing to do but attach herself to the boys and teach them Spanish.  It almost seems like she was thrown in to obviate the obvious homosexual overtones.

All of the classic themes are still there but told more boldly than ever.  The arrival of civilization and the loss of the west.  In essence, the western is a tragedy about the loss of the rugged individualism, the character from which America was made.  People miss this and that is why we revisit the western time and again.  Modern ""western"" like Tombstone (which I really liked) kind of give us the window dressing of why we liek westerns (e.g., gunfights, black hats, etc.) but dont catch the main theme of the disapearing west..the tradeoff of the rugged individualism for civilization.

Timeless western classic,"This came out the same year as another crucial western, The Wild Bunch. This was in a lot of ways similar to that in the sense that they are both stories about outlaws in the final days of the west, but they are approached in completely different ways. Both are game changers for cinema and great, great movies. While I have a slight preference for The Wild Bunch, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance kid is a tremendous movie as well. This project is more light-hearted than the aforementioned classic, but is is not in any way less potent of a film. The film looks great and was very original and took a very different and fresh approach to the genre. Paul Newman and Robert Redford saddle up for roles for a lifetime and share a perfect and very organic onscreen chemistry. While the film has a bit of humor, it is a great story with multiple layers to these characters. Director George Roy Hill was brilliant in bringing this to life and it was a huge hit on its release and spoke to a generation. This is a precursor to the buddy film, but has more depth and complexity to it. Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid is a great film and is very unique.

"""You just keep thinkin', Butch. That's what you're good at.""","You can find this biographical Western on many lists of the best movies of all time and it holds the 219th place on IMDb Top 250 list. The film tells the story of two legendary robbers and gunmen who were harassing the Wild West at the beginning of the last century. The sister of the real Butch Cassidy attended the shooting and was thrilled by how scenario and Paul Newman faithfully portray her brother. Technically, the film has no obvious shortcomings, Paul Newman and Robert Redford are excellent, and the rest of the cast are on the level too. The music is unusual for this genre, but very good and it won an Oscar. The film is an adventure crime drama, but it has a strong comic note, masterfully measured to be extremely fun but it does not escape into comedy. The strongest trump is certainly well-written dialogues that, although humorous and witty, serve not only as ""comic relief,"" but primarily for the characterization.

The American legendary robbers that catapulted Redford's career!!!,"Sounds strangely that the story of Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid never had a major production untill William Goldman developed a screenplay for those famous Bank & Trains's gang robbers, further even before the story be sell to any corporation, Paul Newman and Steve McQueen already had discuss the embryonic project, what's the hell going on maybe we never know, but Steve McQueen was considered to do Butch Cassidy and Newman Sundance Kid, the came up the newcomer Robert Redford, that was a turning point at his career, the picture was release under suspicious, it was an unusual approaching on western pictures, starting for the music score, too atypical, also the humor oriented that wasn't previously planned by the director, the chemistry between Newman and Redford was astonishing, willfully by someone who already had reach on the top and was kind-hearted to give the real opportunity and space to growth Sundance's character, perhaps just Newman was able to do such greatness in benefit of his co-star Robert Redford, it was unspoken on bonus material and the movie itself, George Roy Hill already realize such thing, in that time the Cassidy's younger sister was alive and was invited by the producers to be in the premiere, but the smart old lady wants something more, fantastic movie with the most finest landscape ever shot on several western locations!!Resume:First watch: 1980 / How many: 5 / Source: TV-DVD / Rating: 9.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Bullseye,"Yes, it's a buddy flick - that was nothing new even back then...remember ""Some Like it Hot""? The buddy motif, of course, is the license to have fun: reading lines, improvising lines, squabbling over who's going to do what (and in the making of this, Newman and Redford switched roles right before filming -- imagine that happening in a studio feature today).But it's so much more. What makes it so timeless is the way the seemingly disparate parts are composed into a greater whole: a framing reference to a silent movie (""Great Train Robbery""), 'silent movies' within the larger movie, stories told with the motion of penny arcade viewing slides, sepia tones to match the changes in the plot's direction...And cinematically, the centerpiece is the masterful composition of the chase scene, with our heroes occupying the foreground, the posse always in the background, and their bantering comments on what they think they're seeing, which tells the story of what *we're* seeing.Dead on target, essential viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Irresistible and manipulative,"What's not to love about 'Butch Cassidy'? Three bona fide stars with much appeal, a funny script, some lovely Burt Bacharach music.I found this a very entertaining film when it was first released; indeed, one of the best films of 1969.Subsequent viewings have been disappointing. How can I put it? Lots of nice frosting and not much cake.It's viewed best as a light comedy western, I think. Then again, I like ""Cat Ballou"" for the same reason. And although ""Butch Cassidy"" has some truly funny moments, I can't think of anything as funny as Lee Marvin's ""Kid Shaleen"" from ""Cat"", for which he deservedly won an Oscar.I also think of a true classic, ""Destry Rides Again"", which kept a running dramatic story right along with some wonderful comedy.Don't get me wrong. Katherine Ross is very pretty. Newman and Redford are appealing, handsome male leads. It has a refreshing, quirky style. And it doesn't hurt to have one of Burt Bacharach's better movie soundtracks. (Although I find his ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head"" melody as over-rated as this film.)Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Redford is notorious for taking easy roles, always the 'hero' or 'anti-hero' (most likely the 'hero').Newman on the other hand is a fine actor, and has taken on some strong parts ('The Hustler', 'Cool Hand Luke'). I expect more of him.I've come to regard this film as a very entertaining and manipulative film. What's not to like about it? Redford at the height of his sex appeal, Newman's dreamy blue eyes, a very lovely Katharine Ross. It's a success. It's a very easy success.Personally, I'll take James Stewart and Dietrich's 'Frenchie' over this flick.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Great unusual western,"The film surprised me a bit because this is not a typical western. After just a few minutes it became clear to me that this was something different because I laughed a couple of times. Although humor is by no means dominant, it still has it in a certain dose, but it was completely in place so it actually suited me. The scenery is great and beautiful, and that's a very important thing about westerns.But by far the best thing about this film are the two main stars Newman and Redford. The chemistry between them is amazing, every scene, every conversation is golden. I was even a little surprised because after the movie I went to Google to look and saw that there were 11 years of differences between them, and that you could not see in the movie.If I have to point out any flaw then it is that some musical montages lasted maybe a bit longer for my taste. Also the female character was a little silly to me even though they tried to make some kind of love triangle. Otherwise everything else is great.A great and unusual western with great actors and a satisfying ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

After watching this movie one always leaves with a grin on the inside (the box car exploding, the knife fight, and ""who are those guys?"") no matter how many times one has already viewed this classic.

The Sundance Kid) were apparently real old-west outlaws in what would become known as ""The Hole in the Wall Gang."" Screenwriter William Goldman and director George Roy Hill took what was known of their legends (e.g. Butch hated shooting guns and Sundance loved it) and fashioned a fictionalized tale on the big screen that's wildly entertaining, no matter how many times you've seen it. Katharine Ross went from sitting in the back seat with Dustin Hoffman in ""The Graduate"" to sitting on a bicycle's handlebars in front of Paul Newman in this movie, wondering aloud if she had picked the right boyfriend with Robert Redford. And whatever you think of the music of Burt Bacharach and Hal David, there's no denying their songs are ear worms you can't/won't soon forget. Paul Newman and Robert Redford would team up once more with director Hill a few years later for the even better (and entirely fictional) story of an elaborate con job, ""The Sting.""

The true story was carefully researched and realistically recreated by the director Roy Hill, and though there are many fictional liberties, the story follows the careers of the titular outlaws with remarkable accuracy.

This film was very popular among movie-goers, that it gave rise to a whole new generation of American western films in the 1970s and 1980s.The soundtrack to the film is just as amazing as the film itself, with 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head' sticking out. Also, the last scene in the film, which was set in Bolivia has stirred more interest in Butch and Sundance since the film was released in 1969.Robert Redford even used his character Sundance in the film, as the name of his film festival, which is recognized worldwide.

Greatest Western ever made......,"Greatest Western ever made. The film takes a fairly sympathetic view of Butch and Sundance, treating them as amiable folk heroes rather than as dangerous criminals, and fosters the legend that they never actually killed anyone during the American part of their career, relying upon threats and bluff rather than the actual use of force. (They do shoot people in Bolivia, although only in self-defence). In ""The Wild Bunch"" too Peckinpah is generally rooting for the Bunch rather than for their enemies, and it has been suggested that this attitude owes something to the spirit of anti- authoritarianism and rebellion which were in the air during the late sixties. I am not so sure. Glamorisation and sentimentalisation of real- life Western outlaws was nothing new; Hollywood had been doing it at least since the days of Tyrone Power and Henry Fonda as Jesse and Frank James, and probably long before that. If the Production Code forbade glamorising criminals, the scriptwriters simply denied that these men were criminals in the first place. The end of the Code in the sixties merely meant that film-makers could be more barefaced about something which had long been common practice.The film was a huge success at the box office and the top grossing film of 1969. Its reception from the critics was generally favourable and it won four Academy Awards. It helped to make a major star of Robert Redford and to cement the reputation of his older co-star Paul Newman; the two actors and the director George Roy Hill were later to team up again to make ""The Sting"". (Oddly enough, Redford was not the first choice for Sundance; that was Jack Lemmon, who turned it down). It has been selected for preservation in the United States National Registry of the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."" Despite these achievements, however, I have never quite been able to see it as a great milestone in the history of the cinema, which is how some have described it.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A beautiful film,"This was both my first proper Western and my first proper Paul Newman film - and I was extremely pleased with it. It combines gun shooting with romance, wit, an adventure and two characters that you can never forget: Butch Cassidy (played by Paul Newman - R.I.P) and the Sundance Kid (played by Robert Redford). You stay with these two characters and their female partner (played by Katharine Ross), the whole way and you begin to love 'em.In this film, two Western outlaws called Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, find themselves the only surviving members of their criminal gang: the Hole in the Wall gang. The two try to start building new lives, but they can still not keep away from bank robbing...I loved this film because of everything in it - the only things I did not like about this film are the endless amount of gun fightings (many of these scenes could have easily been shortened). What I enjoyed most about this film was the romance and adventure, often you feel like you are really there with BC and TSK when they gallop, canter, trot and walk their horses through the wilds of America. The wit was also a very good touch, just about necessary in my opinion - although many other people will disagree with me on this.I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys gun shooting, good actors, romance, humour and amazing journeys combined!

A Classic,"A classic of American cinema, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a surprisingly funny movie at times while being dead serious at others. It's the tale of two outlaws, the titular Butch and Sundance, who are on the run from an all-star posse intent on killing them for a wealthy client. Sundance brings his wife along as they trek to Bolivia, where they get back into their old ways after going straight for quite a bit. This leads to a climactic confrontation between the duo and the police.Before I gripe, I do enjoy this film a lot and think that Paul Newman and Robert Redford have great on screen presence and chemistry. That said, I find that the film has bad balance. It can be a really funny movie but it also goes into serious life or death scenarios ten minutes later. The bicycle scene was cute and silly but then the two are running for their lives from the posse and I'm scratching my head.Humanizing characters, especially anti-heroes, is a good thing but I feel the film took it much too lightly. I also found the ending lacking. I understand what happens but cutting off the film at such an emotional point seems kind of lame. This is the same year that The Wild Bunch was released and I was expecting the ending to be like that, with a massive, action-packed shootout. Instead we're left with a mildly amusing ending that doesn't do as much justice to these two legendary characters as I feel it should have.I don't have too much to say as I really can't complain too much and I can't rave about this movie enough to do it justice. It's a fantastic western that any fan of the genre should see and any fan of film should take note of. I don't think it's the best western ever made, but it is a very memorable one that belongs in any hardcore film fans collection.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"""I've got vision while the rest of the world has bifocals""","What a treat this film turned out to be! First of all, credit must be given to the tremendous on-screen duo, Robert Redford and Paul Newman! Their chemistry was top notch, and a complete joy to watch from scene to scene. Now, to the film, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid allows the audience to be a part of the Hole in the Wall gang, led by Butch Cassidy. Paul Newman's Butch comes through the screen as a fun- loving ham of a mischief maker in the Old West. He has no problem leading his gang of outlaws through bank holdups and train robberies, and he does so with ease given his disposition. What a performance from Paul Newman! His good-humored outlaw tops the critic's charts of performances, and I see why. Just watching his character makes the audience want to jump in and holster up for he and his gang. And where there is Butch Cassidy, you will also find the Sundance Kid. Butch's right hand man, Robert Redford's Sundance Kid is a stoic man's man, a perfect partner to Butch. Sundance is charged with keeping Butch's ideas mounted in realistic expectation, and keeping him focused; no doubt were these two large tasks, but Redford's Sundance Kid is the perfect character to manage both. This is one of the best on-screen duos I have ever seen! As we follow the gang through the story, we find out that, as the Wild West is becoming a bit less wild, there has been a special gang composed solely to bring about the downfall, deaths, of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. No matter how far they go, or how stealthily they travel, the appointed gang is never far behind. Another treat to the film is getting acquainted with Etta Place, played by Katharine Ross. We meet her in a compromising situation, and soon realize that Sundance has a sense of humor as well. There was no mistake that Etta was the Sundance Kid's girl, but the audience is left to wonder, as the chemistry between she and Butch is made apparent, if there were not a Jules and Jim type of agreement between the two of them regarding Etta. One will never know the full intricacies of the gang, we still enjoy a riveting story of outlaws trying to outrun their demise, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is remains forever, a classic. Technically, there is not enough good that can be said about this film. As it begins, the audience is introduced to the gang through a silent ""movie"" being shown which really cements the notion of traveling into the past. The film also opens with an almost sepia colored wash over the film, then, after a run-in, we are greeted with a beautiful transition to full color so well done it was reminiscent of the transition in The Wizard of Oz. Brilliant camera work also accompanied the picture with wonderful shots of open plains and enough mountains to satisfy even this Colorado girl's heart! Certainly, no comprehensive review of this film would be complete without mention of its exquisite score. This score provides the perfect mix of songs for the perfect mix of characters on screen. About 2/3 of the way through the film there is a wonderful montage showing the characters as they complete their journey, again, really allowing the audience to immerse themselves in this world and feel like part of the gang. This film is a wonderful work of art that has sustained the years, and now resides in my personal top 20 favorite films!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

This is a really fun movie that is an absolutely must see and American cinematic gold,"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) is a movie I watched for the first time in a long time on Amazon Prime.

"May not be the complete truth, but it's great fun to watch","In this film, ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" Paul Newman and Robert Redford team up to portray those two notorious bandits from the later days of the Old West.  Newman and Redford give the two bandits an almost likeable image, and one almost wishes they had not chosen the path they were on, because the ultimate price is paid for their devotion to criminal actions and misdeeds.  The two outlaws could probably have made a success at any line of work, but they chose to be good at a vocation that was outside the limits of the law.With the two stars, Newman and Redford, turning in great performances, a great musical score featuring the tune ""Raindrops Keep Falling on my Head"" by Burt Bacharach, and a fine supporting cast, this film will rate as a very enjoyable way to spend an evening.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

LAST OF THE GREAT WESTERNS,"George Roy Hill's ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is a Western like no other. It's so much more than your standard cowboys and indians shoot-em-ups that we've grown accustomed to. This film is about character and Hill provides us with two of the most likable outlaws in screen history and we care about them for two hours, not an easy task.Paul Newman and Robert Redford are cast as Butch and Sundance. I cannot think of more perfect casting. However, we have the stars to thank for that. The odd thing was that Newman was cast as Sundance and Redford as Butch originally. Newman suggested that they switch roles and Redford agreed. I think, that by playing against type, it shows that Newman and Redford are so much more than good looking leading men. They are fine actors as well.Ordinarily, a normal Western would have comedy relief. But the great thing about ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is that it is one big  comedy itself, although how much you find funny depends entirely on personal taste.In the one line summary, I said that this film is the ""last of the great westerns"". I think that is true. There were several good westerns that came out after this (There Was A Crooked Man, The Ballad of Cable Hogue, Two Mules for Sister Sara, Junior Bonner, The Outlaw Josey Wales), but until Clint Eastwood's ""Pale Rider"" and Lawrence Kasdan's ""Silverado"", both released in 1985, came out, there were no truly great ones. Along with Sam Peckinpah's brilliant ""The Wild Bunch"", 1969 was the year of the last great Western.**** out of stars",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nice Fantasy Ride,"I enjoyed this film, I had heard a lot about it over the years, but never had the chance to sit down and watch it. I also have heard a lot of mention on behalf of famous actor Paul Newman, who I had never gotten a chance to view one of his films until now. The movie itself did well in capturing the essence of suspense and adventure. It had me on the edge of my seat at times and evoked a sense of wonder. I think the American people all have a side to them that wants to rebel against government and the law. This movie, which came out in 1969 stands to represent just that. As the cultural revolution is in full swing, this movie helps capture the imagination of freedom with these two characters. The cinematography is very well done, there are a lot of shots that i found to be extremely visually appealing. There certainly is a good job done in the process of creating verisimilitude. The film easily captures my own spirit and my own personal desire to rebel. I would sincerely recommend this film to just about everyone.

One of the Greatest... a must see for all people of all ages,"""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" is without a doubt one of the few movies that you will enjoy in so many ways. Paul Newman and Robert Redford are a brilliant sight on the big screen in a hilarious classic that will have first-time viewers in tears of laughter. What is so genuine and extraordinary about the comedy in this movie is its originality. They aren't the same old lines spoken in every comedy today, and, just like so many classics, they aren't all sex-related. The face on Redford during half the movie is PRICELESS.

The Original Anti Hero Story. Superb,"First and foremost. I am not a fan of westerns, especially spaghetti westerns. This is an altogether different experience. The characters are relatable and enjoyable to get to know. The relationship between Newman and Redford is a delight from start to finish. They genuinely seem to be having fun and their chemistry drags you in to feel that you are their with them. The story is easy to follow but captivating.

The ultimate buddy film,"I saw this during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it many times since. It obviously borrowed heavily from the success two years earlier of Bonnie and Clyde where filmmakers took a story about two real life outlaws and fictionally dramatized their story with two good looking actors in the roles of the real bandits. In Bonnie and Clyde they made it a doomed romance and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid they made it two doomed buddies and a beautiful woman for a love interest. Butch in real life was Robert Parker who rode with the outlaw Mike Cassidy and used Cassidy's name as a last name and was a cattle rustler and then a train and bank robber. The Sundance Kid was Harry Longabaugh also known as Kid Curry and the Sundance Kid who was a part of Butch's Hole in the Wall gang of the 1890's and early 1900's. Etta Place is an historical mystery believed to be Ethel Place but since the Sundance Kid's mother's maiden name was Place it's likely she took that name to conceal her true identity. Belived by some to have been the female Colorado cattle rustler Ann Bassett and believed by some to have been a prostitute from Texas few believe the story that she was a schoolteacher who went west for adventure. Paul Newman and Robert Redford star in their first screen pairing along with Katherine Ross and Strother Martin, Cloris Leachman and Ted Cassidy. George Roy Hill had only directed a handful of films before this movie although all were good and he was most noted for Thoroughly Modern Millie. He would direct only eight more before he retired but had continued success with The Sting, Slapshot and The world According to Garp. Novelist and screenwriter William Goldman wrote the story. This film won three Academy Awards for Goldman's screenplay and for Burt Bacharach's music score and song Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head. It was also nominated for Best Director, Best Picture and Best Sound. The only part of this movie I don't like is the video-within-a-movie of the Raindrops song and Butch and Etta's fanciful romantic bicycle ride. I'm most people loved that sequence but it brought the pace of the film to a halt for me. despite that I would still give it a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Its a lovely film,It's a lovely film with Paul Newman and Robert Redford having a great time. The train robbery is excellent but the second time not so well and they decide to uses banks instead which seem really easy and I'm not sure if they even need all the money. The music is splendid and Raindrops Feeling on my Head good but not too long. The story goes well and then suddenly seems to stop and then with some really excellent photography in sepia and thats it. Splendid.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Western tragicomedy,"The style of this film is unlike other Westerns. Instead of the extreme of virtuous heroics or brutal realism, it dabbles in a near-moronic sort of low key comedy. The protagonists are hapless in an awkward but charming way, engaging in bumbling conversations and relying on outdated methods. In a way, this style is like a very early precursor of the signature Joss Whedon and Wes Anderson quippy dialogue. This is not to disparage the other aspects of the film - the music, setting and actions are all well done - but they are all subservient to this stylistic experiment. It almost pays off except for the ending which went nowhere.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Greatest Movie Ever?,"If there is a movie that gauges what sort of person one is, it is without a doubt ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"". If you don't like this movie, you are a grouch, have horrible taste, are quite stupid and should not be allowed to procreate or even dwell amongst the general population. This movie invented the modern Action/Comedy. The proletarian anti- hero who somehow manages to barely get away with some pretty amazing things while cracking some jokes along the way has its archetype in Butch Cassidy. Well before John McClane was blowing up the headquarters of 20th Century while shout ""Yippie Kay-Yay"" and Axel Foley was shoving bananas up the tail pipes of pursuing police vehicles, Butch Cassidy was popping off one-liners and using his smarts to outwit his enemies in a fun and action- packed way. Sundance one-ups any Steve McQueen character in his quiet, confident cool. It's no wonder that McQueen was the original actor offered the role. It's just as well that he turned it down on account of something rather stupid (He wanted top billing over arch-rival Paul Newman). This is Bobby Redford's best role. It would be unimaginable for anyone else to play the Sundance Kid. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a non-stop thrill ride and a good old fashioned zany comedy along with being the best movie ever in my humble opinion. It should have won Best Picture in 1969 and Paul Newman should have won Best Actor for this role. It was a crying shame that while nominated, the forgettable Midnight Cowboy win the top prize that year (on account of being Rated X and controversial for its time). After all, this was at the height of the counter-culture. Regardless, this is the one film you must see before you die. As a matter of fact, to call it a mere Western or a Comedy or a 60's flick is to do this movie a grave injustice. This movie lies within the range of ""Most Under-appreciated Movie Ever"" to ""Greatest Film of All Time"". If you disagree, seek immediate psychiatric help! You've been gauged as mentally disturbed.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

used running W,"This film is one of my all time favorites. I am a true blue fan of the western. Teaming of Newman and Redford worked so well! However, I am so disappointed in the use of a running W on the white mule. Yes, they didn't break the mules neck when it fell...but they could have...all for the making of a scene??? Finding out what was done to the mule has made me see the film in a totally different light. It is no longer one of my favorites. Just because it wasn't illegal to use this horrible way to make the mule ""fall on his face"" doesn't make it right. That's why we have laws to protect animals when filming in the United States. Had I not know about the use of the running W I would have rated the film high, but will not now. Nor will I watch the film again.

"""Your Time Is Over and You're Gonna Die Bloody, and All You Can Do Is Choose Where.""","This is a great classic western. Rather than show us a redemption or justice tale, director George Roy Hill shows us the life of two anti-hero outlaws, Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford). It is a saga of two men who really have no place in society, wandering from town to town and sticking up banks. Their run from agents hired by a wealthy railroad tycoon leads them to Bolivia, where they continue their lives of crime.This really is the classic tale of a pair of men with no direction in life, aimlessly wandering and seeking gratification and the rush from robbery. The performances by Newman and Redford are top notch, and the cinematography is breathtaking and still holds up over fifty years later. I feel like this movie could definitely have been half an hour or maybe even an hour longer; I think we got a good taste of the relationship between Butch and the Kid but I just wanted more of that.Great movie and it comes recommended to all fans of classic cinema and westerns.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Humorous depiction of the end of the western era. These were the last 2 real western cowboys, but they had fun while it lasted.","A word of warning for those who might expect a standard western. It is not. It is deliberatedly made to confuse you a bit, to do things differently. Some wont be pleased by that, because they long for a straight western story. It is not. It definitely has got a sixties feel to it, in which period a lot of experimenting was done. The 2 robbers arent fearless for instance. One of them hasnt even ever killed a man. That's unheard of in a standard western, where men are always butch. His name is butch cassidy, but he isnt really butch at all. These subtle tongue in cheek gests at the western genre, wont get picked up by the more casual viewer, who might easily think it is neither fish or flesh and even somewhat boring, because of the pace of the movie. I think this movie can best be judged as a mild parody of the standard western genre.The story is about 2 legendary bankrobbers who are being chased down to the south, after they became too greedy. Some good jokes, some nice action. Just a delight to watch.Special note for the cinephiles: The photography by Conrad L Hill needs to be especially praised, because it features some of the most stunning vistas of deserts ever recorded on the silver screen, a quality you would not expect to see in a comedy western. When you look at the resume of this photographer you will understand that this man is a grandmaster in his line of work. He has filmed impressive classics like ""The Marathon Man"", ""Fat City"", ""Cool Hand Luke"" and modern classics like ""American Beauty"" and ""Road to Perdition"". I dare say that this photographer stands among the greatest photographers of american movie history.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Class of characterization and dialogue writing and creating special and pure scenes,"It has a very good script. It has memorable and pure scenes that are very special. When you watch the movie, the quality and cleanliness of the script stand out. Of course, some progressive logic could be stronger and deeper, but overall it's great. In terms of characterization, it has no words. The acting of Robert Redford and Paul Newman is unique. Robert Redford's performance in this role with his excellent revolver is really attractive. Both characters are lovely and attractive. Strong, witty, skilled, invincible, cool-headed, positive, kind-hearted, and loving characters, popular but a thief; There is a sweet contradiction that makes the audience interested in the fate of these two characters. Sweet, funny and interesting dialogues, which are used again for the characterization of the two main characters. The movie could have been shorter and more compact.

Certainly the most perfect western movie ever.........,"This is the story of the two infamous outlaws of the wild world of west Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid.They may be the biggest outlaws that ever hit the area and are the leaders of the gang named ""Hole in the wall"".They are very different from each other,if Butch is a good natured man with great ideas,Kid is quick and deadly as lightning but they are very close buddy,their friendship is so strong that they even love the same women Etta Place,a school teacher.The west in now changing and things are not so easy now as before,luckily escaping the almost certain death Butch and Kid escaped to Bolivia with Etta,where they also started robbing the bank and soon they also became infamous there as ""Bandidos Yanquis"".This movie is not like other western movies,this movie is not as stylish and violent as other western movies of Sergio Leone or The Wild Bunch.This is the original work more like an art movie,very slowly burning masterpiece with the most perfect script ever written for a western movie which get equally great treatment from it's Director. There are many very-well written quotes and lines in the movie which makes the scenes memorable.The second part of the movie is as entertaining and binding as first part of the movie,there is not a single moment where the story gets weak and we felt lack of interest.This is also the most beautiful western movie i have ever seen, wonderful cinematography which makes the prairies and wastelands surrounded by mountains look astonishing,even the montage scenes that are filmed with different brownish color looks so beautiful. Another wonderful thing in the movie is it's soundtrack which is not used to create thrill in action scenes like in other westerns, they use background score(like in a romantic movie) in montage scenes and in the bicycle scene(which is the loveliest scene for me in the movie,the way they use the sunlight which make the scene very pleasing).Brilliant performances and great chemistry among the three lead actors Paul Newman,Robert Redford and Catherine Ross.The whole movie was full of fun and adventure from start to end,a complete entertainment,there are many moments that make you laugh aloud specially train robbery scene but it is not a comedy movie.the ending was so tragic but did not make us sad,which is the only reason for me to give this movie 9 instead of 10,i think the ending should be more emotional.Except this,there is not a single mistake in the movie,this movie have such a high standard of film-making which is very hard to compare with other movies of same genre,perfect and mind-blowing peace of art.I'm not too fond of western movies but Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is one of the best western movie ever made and also among the few westerns that i like so much.For me this is the second favorite western movie(after The good,The bad and The ugly).A must watch for every western movie lover and even if you are not,i recommend this movie as it has everything which you found in traditional western movie but at the same time it is very different and original.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Watch for Paul Newman and Robert Redford!,"I originally did not know what to think about 1969's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Considering people call this film one of the greatest Westerns of all time, I thought the film, although fine, was nothing special of consequence. The I kept thinking about it, kept thinking about it some more, and then truly took a long time to leave my thoughts. Only a very good movie has the ability to do that. After much debate, I still feel this film falls short of being the very best. That said, this is a fun movie that gives the audience some insight on two of America's most famous outlaws plus it has some great character interactions and dynamite performances from Paul Newman and Robert Redford.This film was written by one of Hollywood's greatest screenwriters-William Goldman. He recounted many times how hard it was to get this film rolling off the ground. He spent eight years researching these outlaws. Those who know basic American history should know that these outlaws spent a big chunk of their years in Bolivia. Many of the big studios insisted that Goldman did not include running away to South America in this picture because it defeats the point of a Western. Well, Goldman certainly did not listen. His script is one of the better parts of the movie. Great dialogue is abound in the movie from start to finish.If you think the trio of George Roy Hill, Paul Newman, and Robert Redford sounds familiar, then you are right to think so. The director and his two actors teamed up in 1973 to create the superior The Sting, which is one of my favorite movies of all-time. But they connected together very well here. Newman and Redford show excellent chemistry together from start to finish. They were funny and definitely had a blast together. Katherine Ross, from The Graduate fame, plays the third wheel to these men and also does a fantastic job from what's given to her. I felt like her role was not fleshed out well enough.Robert Parker aka. Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and Harry Lonabaugh aka. The Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) are known for their bank and train robberies. Eventually, one of the rich railroad owners had enough of their antics. He sends a posse made up of the best law enforcement team of the West after these outlaws. With the help of Sundance's girlfriend, Etta Place (Katherine Ross), the threesome travel to Bolivia to escape the American authorities....and to continue what they are good at.In my humble opinion, the first act is excellent but is followed by a second act that whimpers out but is truly saved by a memorable third act. The first act is where Butch and Sundance take down any opposition within their gang and delivered some spectacle with a great train robbery sequence. The second act to me is slow if not a little boring. But the final act where they face off against the South American authorities is violent, bloody, and very entertaining.Before I can finish the review, I must talk about the music. Burt Bacharach's score is one of the more defining scores of 1960's cinema. Also, I love that original song he included, ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head."" I never realized that song became famous thanks to this movie.I really had fun watching this movie, even during the slow second act. You can thank the iconic pairing of Paul Newman and Robert Redford for that. These two gentlemen truly had a wonderful time on set. I was expecting something more gritty and serious from the two, so their jovial chemistry between each other certainly took me by surprise....but in a good way. The movie was also a pleasure to watch thanks to Conrad Hall's camera skills.Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid may not be the best Western movie or my favorite film, but it is certainly an influential one.My Grade: B+",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
This is not a classic,"Don't be tricked; this is not a classic western. Whoever is preaching it to be must be deluded. The movie is silly but unfunny, the songs dated, the scenes disjointed. The characters I guess would be charming if it was 1969 but it isn't anymore. The bicycle scene is so hilariously bad. The Western is the greatest genre in cinema and this makes a laughing stock of it. The only thing going for it is the beautiful shots of American landscapes; but other westerns have done more and been lauded less.Usually Paul Newman is great, usually Redford is too. Watch Cool Hand Luke instead or Jeremiah Johnson. If you want to see them together watch the Sting. Skip this and don't trust people who recommend it.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Along with Unforgiven, possibly the best western of all time","This movie is too often thought of as a western comedy or perhaps a ""buddy film"". While it is both, it is so much more. It is the story of how the last of the 19th century individualists became hopelessly out of place as organized civilization spread through the United States. The outlaws turn away from bank robbing because they are now nearly impregnable. They are chased after by the ""Super Posse"" which is made up of individuals from many states, working together and aided by the very railroads the heroes are robbing. When they finally die, it is because even in Bolivia long-distance communication (I think it was telegraph in the movie) allowed the army to quickly get to the scene. The key moment in the movie is when they are told (not a direct quote), ""Your time is through. The only thing now is to find the time and place of your dying.""My only complaint is that Director George Roy Hill took out a key scene after only a few weeks in the theaters. I was lucky enough to see it before it was cut and it made the movie even more powerful, even if it did, as Hill said, slow it down somewhat. The missing scene is found in the screenplay, which was published into a book.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Finally, I've seen the movie.","Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was an interesting film, and one that stands out for its uniqueness in my memory.The movie sometimes plays more like a really long music video than a traditional western, and the soundtrack- which includes ""Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head""- is wonderful. The movie sometimes takes intermissions to display long passages of time through a series of photographs- all accompanied by the music, of course.The movie is undoubtedly a comedy with only a few serious moments. We follow the trail of the kindly, talkative ""Butch Cassidy"" (Paul Newman) and his polar opposite, the dark, quiet, ""Sundance Kid"" (Robert Redford), and The Sundance Kid's girlfriend, Etta Place (Katherine Ross), who, in typical western lass style fits in perfectly with the two men.Our stars are the outlaws, and as is natural in this kind of film, we find ourself rooting for the ""bad guys"" and hoping that the mean, mean government people (why can't they understand it's not a crime, just another way of life?) don't catch up to them.The movie is a lot of fun, and leaves little to be desired, although it fails when it comes to matching the depth and seriousness of other westerns when it comes to the plot, and may bore some viewers.Oh, and of course, it is missing the famous ""draw.""

When a man they continuously rob gets sick and tired of it, he hires a ""superposse"" to track down Butch and Sundance and kill them. This causes Butch and Sundance to flee to Bolivia and end up trying to go straight, but to no avail. Right from the opening scene to the iconic ending, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is perfect through and through.I bought the Ultimate Collector's Edition DVD on a whim because I'd heard so much about it, and boy am I glad I did. I made a goal for myself to set out and see the classic iconic films. This movie was a great way to kick it off. This movie mixes everything that makes a good movie. It has funny, witty dialogue, great acting, great direction, great cinematography, great everything. Whenever a movie can be dead serious and deathly funny at the same, it's gotta be good. There is not one dull point in this movie. Throughout the entire film there is funny and witty scenes. The scenes where Butch and Sundance are constantly being chased by the ""superposse"" are both funny and tense. There is one great scene where Butch and Sundance have to jump off a cliff, but Sundance can't swim. Then there's a scene where they have to shoot their way out of a tight spot but Butch can't shoot. Both characters have weaknesses, and both have their strengths. I absolutely loved the ending of this movie. It was one of those endings where it's so obvious what happens that they don't even have to show you. The movie just freeze frames and we hear the sounds of what's going on.

one of the best westerns and movies of all time,"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is and always will be known as one of the greatest Westerns, and really greatest movies of all time. though I personally prefer The Good the Bad and the Ugly, and both versions of 3:10 to Yuma, I think Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a much more fun movie.This film seems like an easier Western to get into. A lot of people have the image in their heads of Westerns as cowboys versus Indians and duels at noon (even though most good Westerns don't really fall into that.) I think anyone that imagines Westerns to be this way should watch a film like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Its not your average western but at the same time a near perfect one.The main thing that keeps this film fun and exciting is the team of Paul Newman and Robert Redford. They play off of each other so well, and though it's not really a Western Comedy it often times feels like one. It's a different genre yet it has similar style to The Sting made 4 years later, obviously mainly due to the team up of Paul Newman and Robert Redford and director George Roy Hill.Great dialog, great directing, great acting, great cinematography, and classic shootouts and chases. It's no wonder why this movie is so popular. Some people, including me, aren't a big fan of the bicycle scene with ""Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head."" I don't really think it fits well in the film but it doesn't ruin it. That is my only criticism of the whole film. It's a very original and clever film that deserves all the attention it has got, yet still deserves more.Recommended to anyone, especially fans of Newman, Redford and westerns, and anyone that ""doesn't like westerns"" but is willing to give it a chance, you won't be let down.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Newman is superb playing Butch, the affable guy you'd want to buy a beer in a bar, while Redford's Sundance Kid was, is, and always will be the ultimate cool character in all of film.As a side note, I have to say that it makes me laugh when someone refers to this movie as being ""dated"". A Western, by definition, is dated but if they're referring to the dialog, all I can say is - Are you kidding?? I also find it comical when people complain that there's no real ""plot"" to the film.

"A Really Great ""Modern"" Western","I loved Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. George Roy Hill did a great job giving it the feeling of a real western even though it was released 30 years after the height of the genre.

The best part of this film though has to be the casting. Paul Newman and Robert Redford were great (Especially Redford)and much like Bonnie and Clyde you're easily able to connect with and root for these two although they're constantly breaking the law. The two are witty, charming and surprisingly funny. The only knock I have on this film is the music.

A whimsical Western that doesn't take itself seriously,"It's a whimsical Western set in Wyoming and Bolivia from 1899 to 1908, loosely based on the lives of Robert Parker/Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman), Harry Longabaugh/Sundance Kid (Robert Redford), and Etta/Ethel Place (Katharine Ross). Butch Cassidy is a fast-talking, moderately educated leader of a gang that robs banks and trains. His best friend is the Sundance Kid, a crack shot and somewhat the enforcer. Etta Place is an educated, polished schoolteacher from the East who is nominally the partner of the Sundance Kid, though she is also close to Cassidy.The movie follows the antics of the three, who enjoy daily life and generally try to perform robberies without undue violence. When the Union Pacific makes a determined effort to catch them, they flee to Bolivia where they live for some years while continuing their trade. After Etta returns to the States, Butch and Sundance pull their last job.This movie works because it doesn't take itself too seriously. Except for the end, there is much banter between two guys who are never entirely on top of the situation but are sustained by Butch's naive optimism. Etta Place is mysterious because, in real life, she is a total mystery. This movie saw Newman and Redford blossom as a team, a relationship repeated four years later in ""The Sting."" Burt Bacharach's musical score is marvelous. I'm not sure the cinematic decision to make early scenes appear aged works all that well.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Awesome,Absolutely adored Paul Newman! This movie deserved all 4 oscars. Had the pleasure of rewatching this movie in the theatre. Such a great Western! The chemistry between criminals is so entertaining. Also enjoyed the sepiatone. Would recommend this action packed flick.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One Of The All Time Classics,"Out of all the classic films I have seen one of the ones I like the most is ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"". Most classics to me are overrated and not as good as they are made out to be. This is a very entertaining film, never boring for a second and the two superb leading actors play off each other perfectly to create arguably the most memorable screen team in movie history.I definitely recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
My Favourite Movie Of All Time!,"OK So this has to be my favourite movie of all time. It's not considered to be the best movie ever and I'm not gonna lie it isn't the best but it is MY favourite.Each scene is better than the last, and the chemistry between Redford and Newman is tangible. I have to admit though I am a little bias considering I think Paul Newman and Robert Redford are the most gorgeous men that ever lived, and more than once was I jealous of Etta.The Script is SO funny, i find myself laughing throughout the whole movie, but even though its hilarious the action and drama are still there.I know some people find the music out of place, but i think its just perfect! It works as kind of a comic relief and reflects the pop music of the 60's and beginning of the 70's instead of the tradition western music.Raindrops keep falling on my head is constantly stuck in my mind, along with Redford and Newman and this completely amazing movie",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Simply the Best,"This movie combines the best screenwriter, William Goldman, the best actors, Paul Newman, Robert Redford and Katharine Ross, the best director, George Roy Hill and the best cinematographer, Conrad Hall to make Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid the best movie of its time. It has comedy, action, camaraderie and anything else you could possibly want in a movie. Paul Newman shines in a role that fits his personality perfectly and Robert Redford's breakthrough role is absolutely spectacular. The music is great and (althought it doesn't seem like it) fits perfectly with the tone of the film. This movie has classic written all over it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Strange relationship - a distraction from the core story,"I was somewhat disappointed with the movie Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid because I thought it would be more hardboiled and a more intense portrayal of the Wild Bunch gang's comradeship and the bonds that held them together. Instead the focus is only on the friendship between Butch and Kid, as well as a strange relationship with Etta Place and both men. In reality, she was the girlfriend of Sundance Kid, but in this movie, she's portrayed as having a romantic connection with both men. This added element felt like a distraction from the core story and characters, which I had hoped would delve deeper into the exciting life stories of this infamous gang.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

Very entertaining western,"This is a really fun western and just about nothing about this film is dull or dry. Robert Redford and Paul Newman makes a perfect team, and even though they are bank and train robbers you can't help but want these guys to get away, they are just too charming and charismatic. The plot is entertaining and the dialogue is fun and witty, it really went the right direction. Two great actors in a film makes it even better, Butch Cassidy(Paul Newman) is somewhat of the brains of the operations and The Sundance Kid(Robert Redford) is the muscle or expert gunslinger. I personally think it would have been cool if they got a bit more in depth with the people that are trying to track them down and kill them which leads both the robbers to head to Bolivia. Redford and Newman really shine in this movie and I personally think it's at there best. This is a impressive film and a instant classic. If your into western movies, this is a must watch and I recommend this to any other movie lovers as well.8.6/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Nowadays everything is shot on digital which makes it look like it's shot on a IPhone.THIS is true cinema.I have nothing else to say but I still have to type out 80 or so more characters.

Favorite movie of all time,"Perhaps a love story as much as a western, this movie chronicles and romanticizes the relationship of Robert Leroy Parker (Butch) and Harry Longabaugh (Sundance).  Newman and Redford were never better together. Amply supported by Strother Martin, Katherine Ross, Ted Cassidy, Jeff Corey, this has to be a must-see on any true movie fan's list.Butch and Sundance were still outlaws, but George Roy Hill's account of their life and times comes surprisingly close to capturing the true events. Newman and Redford obviously add to the charm, but Butch was supposedly a charming outlaw.  Sundance and other gang members were the ones who ever shot anyone, but not Butch.  If there was such a thing as a gentleman outlaw, Butch was supposed to be it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
I love the soundtrack,"I saw this movie when it premiered and I was 8. I probably didn't understand the whole thing, but thought overall it was entertaining. ( I also got to see Robert Redford - although I really didn't know much about him then, except that I should be impressed.)Through the years I've listened to the music a lot and also performed it on the piano. In the last couple of years I 've come back to the music and appreciate it more than ever. The music is wonderful!!!As an adult I have enjoyed the film even more. I love the list of quotes, it brought back a lot of memories and chuckles. What a great film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A fine piece of effortless entertainment,"I fully admit that much of my passion for this film lies in the fact that it is one of earliest memories of seeing a movie. It is virtually impossible to remove this film from the memories of my parents and how they looked at the end of the 1960's-early 70's. My folks fancied themselves The Sundance Kid and Etta Place in terms of their dress, attitudes and values. This is not to suggest they were outlaws (maybe in the eyes of Nixon administration they were) but rather folks interested in an older time that never truly existed.  That personal testimonial aside, I still love the film on its own merits. It isn't a work of art to be sure, but it is a fine example of Hollywood creating new myths based upon real legends.  The performances of Redford and Newman are so seemless that it is easy to blur the lines between acting and being a movie star. It may be fashionable to knock their work in this picture as Hollywood confection, but I dare any other actors of the time to pull off these performances. There use of silences and evaluations are far more effective than their dead one line delivery- the mark of a fine acting craftsman. The fact that I as an audience member immediately accept and believe wholeheartedly their circumstance and become lost in the story is a testiment to their ultimate artistry.  Conrad Hall's photography is both breathtaking and heartbreaking. He truly creates a romantic look at a time and place that truly only could exist in historic imagination. It is one of the few films I would absolutely love to step into out of real life. Director George Roy Hill knows exactly how to economically stage a scene while remaining invisible. He varies the stories pace effectively between tension, whimsy and gentle tragedy. His humour is remarkably subtle and sophisticated without the slightest hint of condensation to the audience- a hallmark of a good director.  William Goldman's script does not simply rely on clever one-liners as so many imitators have in creating similar scripts. It is actually poignant in its simplicity and humour. The scene where Butch and Sundance, although mortally wounded still find the courage to dare to dream about a future is really what fine writing and performing is all about.  Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid is a classic film in the sense that it never fails to entertain and touch the heart. Some may find it rather saccarine and manipulative now in this age of cynicism and media hype. I don't and since being a film fan is based so much on raw emotional response to a visual story, this is mine. This film is well worth its rabid following as it appears so effortless in its ultimately entertaining journey. A 9 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"40 years on this film is still funny, poignant and tragic all at the same time",I saw this film for the first time on TV in the seventies and have never seen it at the cinema but based on my experience of watching it on the small screen I would recommend it to anyone. In my opinion its not the best film ever made but its well worth its current position of 152 in the IMDb all time chart. I laughed when I saw this film at the first viewing and I have got to say that I still laugh whenever I see the film although not quite as much. Of course there is more to this film than just the laughs and the film has a good feeling about it and by that I mean that it seems to have been created with a good deal of care and the professionals involved all seem to have done their part. In many ways it was a film like the Sting which was of its time but doesn't really compare favourably to the really great films before or after it was made. That said and after all its only my opinion its well worth watching and is almost two hours of good entertainment.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well-impressed,"I'm generally not the biggest fan of Westerns or of Robert Redford, but this movie has the reputation to be such an all-time classic that I just had to watch it. And I didn't regret it, either.The most impressive thing is the aesthetic cinematography. Every frame looks as if a lot of thought had been put into it. Still, the movie is far away from being a pretentious western epic as so many genre flicks from that period in time were. This is a fleet-footed and funny movie with clever dialog and great performances by both, Newman and Redford.Sometimes it drags on a bit, but that maybe because my perception has been spoiled by today's fast-edited action movies. ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" really is the Hollywood classic it is made out to be. Even the soundtrack is unforgettable. It's a must for everyone who considers himself a lover of cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Most folk heroes start out as criminals, right?","My first western, it turns out, was more of a buddy movie described by another as a ""Beatles movie in Bonnie and Clyde clothes"". Our thieves carry on as the cocky folk heroes they became, full of confidence until doggedly chased by an unrelenting posse. Their journey is full of clever, but honest, dialog and their running from the law through nature's open and awesome backdrop is quite an awe inspiring site. Butch and Sundance mostly share their knowledge to try to figure out, ""who are those guys?"", to no avail. The movie would have been fine without the BJ Thomas hit, may have a plot full of movie inevitability but still has a style full of campfire camaraderie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

And this one certainly has you pondering what happened to the two hero's of the piece after the credits have rolled.The story is filled with the standard elements, from the Western genre but the movie is anything but standard. It is a highly professional piece of work, spectacular and suspenseful, it drags a bit it places but with a good sense of atmosphere it makes for almost perfect entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Goat Duo?!?!?!,"Paul Newman and Robert Redford are American Film heroes. This Movie has an excellent screenplay and the fellas act it out perfectly. Butch and Sundance might be the coolest characters of all time and they wouldn't be the case if it wasn't for Newman and Redford. This is such a fun movie filled with all the likable traits a classic American western should have, its got great humor, awesome costumes and gunslinging action, Robberies galore and a beautiful girl to have a great romance to go along with it. You become attached to these characters so easily and everything they do makes you fall in love even more with them. The ending is also one of the best there is ever.I think the only thing holding it back from a 10 is some parts feel a little slow and drawn out or not as interesting as some of the other moments. This is a movie about the greatest outlaw duo ever maybe and had maybe the greatest acting duo ever yet there are parts where it feels like it falls short of this, especially towards the end.None of that takes away from how much I love this film and how important it is for movie goers to see it. Maybe the most likable western there is and a timeless classic for all. 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Guy Flick for sure,"After the box office success of Bonnie and Clyde a few years before, studios started churning out movies about real-life infamous outlaws and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was arguably the most popular of all. It had everything: a good-looking team of actors at their peak laying on the charm (and humor) who played likeable characters that took what they wanted and went out in a blaze of glory. Throw in a catchy, best-selling theme song (one that had nothing whatsoever to do with the movie) and a story that further glamorized and glorified outlaws and you have an instant hit. Of course, never mind that a big chunk of these films were fictionalized. Many still believe(d) everything they saw on the screen, but the truth is often a different story. I saw this movie when it first came out in theaters and although I thought it was entertaining, the only things I remember were a scene involving a cliff and of course the ending. I wouldn't go so far as to gush about it being ""the greatest movie of all time"" or ""the greatest western ever made"" as some here have. (I'm not sure one would even call it a western.) My only disappointment with it is that neither Paul Newman nor Robert Redford had a nude scene.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
...they dont make em like this anymore...,"Not one of my most favourite films but one of the best loved. It was the early 70's, I was only 12. The Vietnam war was on and The Beatles' were splitting up and this film suddenly sprang up to take our minds of all that. If Butch & Sundances' criminal exploits didn't instil young boys like myself with the desire to imitate they somehow did capture our admiration. To the despair of law enforcement types everywhere no doubt.All the other characters seemed to fit their roles perfectly. The one I best remember was that long suffering guard on the money van who kept getting robbed.What a guy. And Katherine Ross as Etta the school teacher, my word.For a lot of adolescent young lads this was their first view of a pair of breasts and so lovely they were too. The other memorable scene was of course the bike ride with Etta and Butch, and that tune ""raindrops keep falling on my head"" which everyone kept humming days later. Many years later I thought back to that scene which was so incongruous to the whole theme of the movie but somehow seemed to fit in perfectly. There have been more noteworthy films by far but for a few special reasons this is probably my best loved. It would be interesting to see if a new generation will appreciate it in the same way. I suspect not. Oh well...Coincidentally did you know there was a scene at the end which was cut from the original where Butch & Sundance following a long shootout ride of into the sunset with 200 dead bolivian soldiers in their wake...Go figure.",,Anonymous,Biography
Most Of It Is True!,"There was no way in hell I was gonna miss Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid after finding out that it features the same director & duo of actors who were later responsible for the Oscar- winning The Sting, which I dearly loved. And to find it in my collection & realize that it has been sitting there for years turned out to be a pretty pleasant surprise.Loosely based on a true story, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is an American western that tells the story of two Wild West outlaws who are chased by a special posse that is able to pick their trail no matter where they go, thus ultimately forcing the two to escape the law by fleeing to Bolivia where they ultimately find a more successful criminal career.Directed by George Roy Hill, the biggest strength of this film is the flawless chemistry between Paul Newman & Robert Redford who in their respective roles of Butch & Sundance carry the story throughout its runtime, and are wonderfully supported by Katharine Ross who plays Etta Place; Sundance's lover, while its camera-work, editing & music part is exquisitely executed.On an overall scale, there's plenty of fun, humour & charm to be found in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It's a beautiful film to look at, is highly enjoyable & entertaining from start to finish, its premise is handled in a very light-hearted manner and it also manages to culminate on a high with an ending that's as satisfying as it is heartbreaking. Definitely recommended.",,Anonymous,Biography
Wit and charm to spare,"It's interesting to read the comments on this film by younger viewers.

Newman and Redford make an incomparable team, and watching this film is pure joy. They truly don't make 'em like this anymore",,Anonymous,Biography
This is the best western of all time.,"Some scenes include a poker player short of brotherly love, until he finds out the man he accuses of cheating is the Sundance kid. Another sequence in the film is when they run into a lawman they knew from the past, he tells them,""Butch I've never met a more affable man as you, or as good with a gun as you Sundance, but your days are over and you will die bloody deaths."" Another scene in the film which stands out is when the posse chases them to a mountain ledge and Butch says to Sundance, ""we have to jump into the rapids below..."" and he says he can't swim and Butch says ""the fall will probably kill you."" After they were close to being caught in the west headed by lawman Joe Laforest, they decide to go to Bolivia. After they overcome the language barrier they are back just like the old days. When a lawman from the past is seen in Bolivia they decide to go straight. They work as payroll guards but they wind up having a gunfight with Mexican bandits.

western and not,"I wonder whether to think of the film as if it had two parts.  It begins with the credits rolling next to an old theatrical projection, one reminiscent of films belonging to the epoch of the likes of Buster Keaton's ""General"".  Then we are taken to Paul Newman's face.  He is observing a bank.  Probably one he intends to rob.  The first 15 minutes carries a beautiful cinematography.  From the black & white documentary about the Hole in the Wall gang we are carried to a beginning with tones of green and yellow.  Then cut, and a scene in a bar with Sundance.  The only thing revealed is Sundance's facial expressions, and the voice of card players, fingers ticking on the gambling table.  While the camera keeps fixed on Sundance's face, we witness a duel involving him and the guy sitting opposite him, whom we don't see, only hear.  Then comes Paul Newman, whispering into Sundance's ear, asking him to let it go, being the negotiator, a cunning one.  The camera still stays fixed.  A feeling of isolation takes place, like disconnection, loneliness.  Why the face or the fingers instead of a traditional shot involving all the elements which make up the scene?  The bar, the gamblers, the table.  Perhaps it was early in the film to come up with a conjecture, but I nevertheless did.  This film takes the western genre, deconstructs it, and recreates it.  Our sympathetic villains are quite western, the action is quite western, but once you lay hands on the details, the cinematography, disuniform timing, fast forwards, especially when they tour the country and end up in Bolivia, Butch as a cunning businessman way ahead of his time, not belonging to the West, Sundance as the notorious gunman from New Jersey, this film is created by someone who studied western and revolutionized it.  Kind of like what Tarantino did with B-films I guess.  And the duel takes place.  And we see Sundance and Cassidy riding on their horses, with the picture transforming into color.  Then we are taken to the second part of the film.  Butch and Sundance running from an expert team of bounty hunters and lawmen hired to put an end to their lives.  ""Who are those people?""  Spielberg might have decided to reveal the shark in ""Jaws"" in the second half of the film, being inspired by the suspense attempted to be built up by Roy Hill during the struggle of Cassidy pulling all the tricks on their ""mysterious"" followers and the followers figuring the truth out in every single one of them. But out of every element which makes this film so great, perhaps the most electrical component is the lead characters themselves.  They are the most sympathetic bank robbers to hit the west.  Cassidy being my favorite, despite being the leader of the gang, perfectly complemented by his buddy Sundance, he has never killed anyone.  He doesn't bring a serious social criticism, as his robberies are not justified, he simply robs and spends money on alcohol and women, no need for an ethical interrogation on behalf of the audience.  But being a robber, nevertheless he has a charm.  He holds a twisted sense of humor, seems to care about human life, as he warns the clerk in the train to open up the wagon, but doesn't care enough to stop robbing the train as he blows it up despite the clerk, but after the smoke the first thing he does is check to see if the clerk is still alive.  A villain with humor, respect, cunning mind, and selfish priorities.  His relationship with Sundance is worthy.  Throughout the second part of the film, during their fled, the director takes the oppurtunity for us to love these two.  And by the time ""the end"" arrives, we wish they are not dead. And perhaps they are not.  In Peckinpah's Wild Bunch, the gang kills a hundred people or so.  Whatever the conclusion is, the end seemed to be another innovation.  One has to watch Leone's westerns, and then come back to this film to see what kind of a new breathe it has brought. Perhaps.",,Anonymous,Biography
I want to own this film,"I recorded this film the other day and my stupid VCR cut the ending, ofwhich I am most displeased.

I just sat there in my nightgown, heavy with acold, and my eyes widened, as did my smile.I'm not a big western fan. I could mention some comic books I liked as achild, maybe a couple of films and TV series, but that's all. And Icould think of many reasons not to like this film. It's not dirty andrealistic, for those who like that. It's not full of action. It'sremarkably un-hilarious considering how funny it is. But it's a warmfilm, showing two deeply flawed, immature men in a way that makes youwant to take them home in your pocket along with the whole film.

I can't think of another duo in a movie that had such a great mix together. So may great one liners you can't even get through all of them. I still laugh my arse off when they first arrive in Bolivia and Redford steps in crap and gives that look to the camera like, what the heck are we doing here.

Quite the entertaining western adventure...,"...""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford as, well, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, two train/bank robbers who are in trouble with the law, the railroad company, and a possey led by an expert tracker.  Cassidy and Sundance exchange fire with the possey, leap from tall waterfalls and much more in this great comic adventure.The most notable part of ""Butch"" is definitely the screen-writing.  William Goldman also pleased with ""All the President's Men"" and ""The Princess Bride"" among others.  His comic, yet exciting way of writing his adventures that puts him on my list as one of the best screenwriters of all time.Of course, the performances are very well-done too.  Newman is cool and smooth as Butch, but Redford's Sundance would be my favorite character.  His quiet, calm way of acting in dangerous situations makes him as loved as similar characters (i.e.: Mr. Blonde from Reservoir Dogs, Tom Reagan from Miller's Crossing).Everyone loves this western, and for no bad reason, 8/10.",,Anonymous,Biography
An endearing quality,"Seems sort of corny by today's standards (think ""Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head""), but a very enjoyable film nonetheless.  Newman and Redford are lovable bad guys.  They capitalize on the crooks-on-the-run-we'd-like-to-hang-out-with genre made popular a couple years earlier by ""Bonnie and Clyde"".  Their witty, lighthearted banter in the face of doom gives them such an endearing quality.  And Katharine Ross isn't hard to take, either.  Love the bedroom/gunpoint scene.",,Anonymous,Biography

"Good, but not great","Watched this again the other day, probably 10 years since I'd last watched it, and sadly its appeal seems faded.  I note from some other posts here that a lot of Butch's fans are perplexed as to why this film hasn't really been elevated to the western pantheon.  Well, IMHO Butch is far too slick, glib even, to compare to a genuine masterpiece such as The Wild Bunch. Bunch was filmed and released almost contemporaneously with Butch, but despite the similarity of source material (Butch's gang was called The Wild Bunch) any comparison between the two movies is pointlessly invidious: Bunch is profound, lyrical, challenging, complex; Butch is witty and well-made, but it's unashamedly a star vehicle.  There's just no depth here. Plus the ending's a total cop-out.",,Anonymous,Biography
Flight,"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is George Roy Hill's best movie.  Here all his little touches work, except for those atrocious songs by Burt Bacharach.  That guy is overrated.By comparison to The Wild Bunch, BC&SK is an artistic flop because--once again--appeasing the audience supersedes storytelling skill.  Furthermore, Wild Bunch was a flurry of images (a record in the cutting room) while Butch and Sundance proceed on a straight course the whole time with Conrad Hall's camera zooming the whole time.  Sometimes he is more concerned about motion than composition.With Neuman and Redford in this, you know the quality is going to be on the level of, say, Independence Day.  Not once in the story do they get over the fact that all they are doing is cracking one-liners and actually get to acting.  Katharine Ross is more of a crutch to the story, I still can't figure if that's a good or bad thing.  The problem is the movie tries to make its message too obvious as opposed to not worrying about one and having it come off as subtle.  RoboCop had this problem a lot.Overall, this is good, but not great.  For a better Western, see The Wild Bunch.  For better music, try The Blues Brothers.  3 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Biography
All time great film.,"This film is dominated by Newman and Redford. That can be good or bad. In this case it's great as both have tremendous chemistry as always.This set the cowboy genre film to a new level. Loved them in The Sting which also took film-making to a new level.The chase was really creepy - with the man with the white hat pursuing them in the mountains. Very well done scene.I loved the dialogue - very powerful and set the mood of the story just right.Finally, really loved the fact that there wasn't a modern illusion - meaning so much of today's films are political.This was just pure entertainment.",,Anonymous,Biography
My favorite non stereotypical western.,"This is very different.In your stereotypical Western,the hero or heroes almost never run from a fight.Here,the heroes (if you can justify calling them that),spend the entire film running from a fight.Combine this with witty dialog and the undeniable screen chemistry between Redford and Newman,not to mention pleasant scenery,both in the form of filming location and the film's leading lady Katharine Ross,and you've got a winner on your hands.My favorite films in the western genre tend to be a little more on the stereotypical side,but I will say that this is probably my favorite western film that does not include John Wayne,Clint Eastwood,Gary Cooper,or Alan Ladd.",,Anonymous,Biography
Butch & Sundance are still jumpstarting my heart!,"I didn't care much for ""cowboy flicks"" back in those days. I was only 17 when this wonderful movie first came out in ""69. I was mesmerized by those electric blue orbs and by the best mustache that I had ever seen. OOOOOwwweeeee. I was in lust. The casting director sure knew what he was doing with this one. Strother Martin (always befitting of his character), Katharine Ross (although I'm still jealous of her marrying Sam Elliot), Ted Cassidy (Lurch). They all blended so well together. I watch the video at least once a year.It's sort of a tradition for me. Who can ever forget that ""waterfall scene, dialog?"" I can't think of a movie today that even comes close.",,Anonymous,Biography
This movie would be so great...,"...if it wasn't for two scenes that are completely unwatchable...or should I say unlistenable.  The Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head scene is...well...maybe it's just me, but that song is like fingernails on a chalkboard.  Fast forward.  Cut to later in the film for about ten minutes of scat singers singing over several scenes with no dialog whatsoever. Fast forward.  Absolutely awful music...unbelievablely grating and bad.Other than that though...if I could program the DVD to skip those scenes completely...it's a great movie.",,Anonymous,Biography
My all time favorite.,"I think people under the age of thirty won't appreciate this film as much as some of us older folks (I'm only 35).Despite the fact that I'm only 19 and that how much I loved Star Trek II, this one will always be my favorite movie. From the beginning to end it was a great movie. I know it's probably not 100% realistic, but the people in it made it a great movie and one that most people have no idea about. I told my friends in high school that I liked this movie and they never heard of it or said that they heard it wasn't good. It's one of the few movies I've watched on AMC.

Newman and Redford Make This a Classic,"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969)*** 1/2 (out of 4)After robbing one bank too many and having the law right on them and not letting up, Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) and the Sundance Kid (Robert Redford) decide it's time to head for Boliva. Once there they discover that the quiet life is too boring so they go back to robbing banks.Many people consider BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID to be one of the best movies of the decade and one of the greatest Westerns ever made. I'm not going to go that far on either one but there's no question that this is a great little gem that has a lot going for it. Of course, the best thing going for it are the two lead performances by Newman and Redford.It's easy to forget that when this movie was released Redford really wasn't a famous person. Sure, people knew who he was but this is the film that turned him into a superstar and it's easy to see why. He's certainly believable as the fast gunfighter but where the performance really shines is with the comic timing. Redford is really, really funny here and that laid back approach really works well. Of course Newman was already a legend by the time he made this so it's no shock how great he is.Newman and Redford simply have a wonderful chemistry and even though neither are comic actors, their timing and chemistry with each other is just so perfect that it's impossible to see anyone else in these roles. The supporting cast also features a fine performance from Katherine Ross and Strother Martin in a bit part. The film also benefits from some beautiful cinematography, which perfectly captures the vast landscapes. Throw in a nice music score and the Oscar-winning Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head and you've got a very memorable gem.",,Anonymous,Biography
Chemistry makes a movie,"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was released in 1969. This is a great period for movies because the Hays Code had just ended. Characters were allowed to act differently than before, usually in sexual ways. An example of this is when Butch Cassidy had his girlfriend undress in front of him. The next scene begins with them in bed together. During the Hays Code married partners were not even allowed to sleep in the same bed. The acting in this movie was great. These roles were perfect for Redford and Newman because although they were best friends in the movie, they were also friends in real life. This created great chemistry between them which made the acting so natural and realistic. There was one problem with continuity after Stother Martin's character was shot. In the first scene he is lying with a branch across his face and in the next scene the branch is gone. This movie is one of my favorite westerns and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys action and hilarity.",,Anonymous,Biography
ESTE ES UN ROBERTO,"HI THIS IS ROBERTO SPEAKING, I AM GRUNTIES FAVOURITE STUDENT *GIGGLES SLIGHTLY* I LOVED THE LINE WHERE THEY SAID ""ESTE ES UN ROBERO BECAUSE IT REMINDED ME OF MYSELF. IT ALSO HELPS A LOT WITH CHEMISTRY SINCE WE LEARN THE CHEMICAL FORMULAS FOR GUNPOWDER. I LOVE THIS FILM AND GRUNTY.",,Anonymous,Biography
chemistry at its best,"steve mcqueen's wife related that newman came from next door to steve's house to offer the sundance role to him and that steve would have taken it had paul given him top billing.....as it turned out of course redford got the role due to steve's stubborness....and in retrospect we cant see anyone now but redford in that role....the chemistry with newman and redford continued in the sting about 5 years later.....i love the movie but with 2 faults.....one, the dated ""ba, ba, bah, bah, ba bah, soundtrack of burt bacharach.....raindrops was nice but enough of the interlude stuff....the other thing is the film leaves you empty wanting more and of course they died so what do you do?.....I think better editing would have allowed for more scenes of action....perhaps with ""percy garret"" (strother martin)....or more train action....whatever the case, the film seems short and too fast paced getting to bolivia and their demise.....great movie however and very picturesque in backdrops....but the chemistry and humor are the main ingredients that make this film such a classic....perhaps one of the first films that blended comedy into a drama.",,Anonymous,Biography
